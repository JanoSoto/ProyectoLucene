[{"Title":"One of the most underrated movies of the eighties","Date":"16 September 2004","Score":"134 out of 152 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Umberto Eco's novel has something of a reputation as one of the great unread bestsellers. To have it on the shelf in the early eighties was a fashion statement as much as it was a literary necessity. And yet when the film was released, it was attacked for being an ineffective adaptation. Turning the 600-page novel, a detective mystery enriched by descriptions of medieval life and semiotic ruminations characteristic of Eco's academic writings, into a mainstream two-hour movie was, of course, ambitious. Four credited screenwriters and an international co-production gave off a sense of struggle and indecision. The movie was, and remains, easy to deride.It's true that the film, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, has to skip, or skirt, much of Eco's detail - the famous pages-long description of the doorway, for example, is acknowledged by a few camera shots - but it takes the novel's literary strengths and offers a cinematic equivalent a vivid depiction of monastic life which thrusts the viewer into the period of the story. In this respect, the production is exemplary cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli, art director Dante Ferretti and composer James Horner were all operating at the top of their game.And, as Renton in Trainspotting (1996) knows, Sean Connery proved a perfect choice as William of Baskerville, the 14th-century Sherlock Holmes figure investigating the deaths in an Italian monastery. It's one of Connery's best performances, a happy marriage of character acting and star casting he suits the physical description of William and he properly conveys the character's wisdom, caution and sense of regret. Christian Slater's Adso, the narrator of the novel, is a surrogate for the viewer, expressing bafflement at the mystery story and awe at William's deductive powers; while F. Murray Abraham works wonders with the underwritten part of the inquisitor Bernardo Gui.The Name of the Rose is one of the most underrated movies of the eighties. That it wasn't brilliant should not detract from the fact that it's as good as it is.  "},{"Title":"Criminally underrated by some, hailed as a masterwork by others. Who's right?

For in all honesty The Name of the Rose is one of the greatest films of the '80s, and a film that grows in greatness every time you revisit it. Based on a major bestselling novel by Umberto Eco, the film is an excellent murder mystery further heightened by its authentic period trappings and a clutch of tremendous performances.Brother William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his young apprentice Adso (Christian Slater) are monks who arrive in a 14th Century monastery having been summoned for a religious conference. Soon after their arrival, a series of bloodthirsty murders take place and the friars still alive begin to fear that either the Apocalypse is upon them, or a highly disturbed individual is out to bump them off. Brother William has a penchant for sleuthing, so he probes into the mysterious deaths and discovers that each victim had laid his eyes upon a Greek manuscript hidden deep within the interior of the monastery. He gradually realises that the killer must be targeting those who know of the book's existence, but just as he is about to solve the killings an inquisitor (F. Murray Abraham) arrives and tries to discredit Brother William's theories, preferring to blame the crimes on non-existent heretics and satanists.The film is very realistic in every way - the cold, uncomfortable monastery; the graphic murders; grotesque and disfigured characters; a startlingly explicit sex scene; authentic-sounding dialogue; excellent indoor and outdoor locations; and well-researched costume designs. Furthermore, it is a superbly paced film, never in too great a hurry to unravel but never so slow that it becomes a plod. Connery is great as the hero, surpassed only by Abraham in a breathtaking role as Bernardo Gui the inquisitor, and Slater does well considering his tender age as the loyal apprentice. Both Roy Scheider and Michael Caine were short-listed for the Connery role, but I don't see how either actor could've done better with the character. Jean Jacques Annaud directs outstandingly, capturing every shadow, every expression and every plot piece with the eye that only a director obsessed with his material possibly can. The Name of the Rose makes the top #50 of the 1980s without question.

I've always had the mickey taken out of me for loving this film, and it's right up there amongst my favourites of a very eclectic bunch.  Why?  Well, firstly and I have to say, very importantly, it's taken from the finest piece of modern literature I've read.  Umberto Eco's novel has such mammoth scope of subject matter and detail, it is was always going to be extremely hard to put into film (Dune anyone??), and Annaud certainly doesn't succeed in every way, but my lord he gives it a damn good go. The film quite rightly focusses on the human story within the book of a group of murders committed at an Italian abbey in the 14th Century, and the ongoing search for the purpetrator, by a Franciscan monk and his apprentice. The book encompasses many other issues and plotlines, which could not be fitted into the film. The three screenwriters do an excellent job, of filming the almost impossible to within 2 hours or so. Most importantly to me, the cinematography and set are sublime, almost unsurpassed in modern film to my mind, and still to this day amazing. I've always found that many non movie-lovers remember this film, for good or bad.  The main reason for me is that it recreates so impressively the period it represents. Tonino Delli Colli, I salute you. The production team deserves a similar merit for bringing together what was in essence an European co-production, whilst not forgetting the biggest exterior set built in Europe since Cleopatra. Step forward Dante Ferreti. I salute you too. 0.1 of a mark off for the editing, but let's not dwell on that. The acting is, bar none, marvellous, with even Christian Slater in his first main role putting up an extremely decent stab of being an apprentice monk.I like a good whodunnit, but I adore a whodunnit which throws in the visual magnificence of a different age, top notch performances, a script taken from a extraordinary source, and assured directing. 10 out of 10, and my mates can carry on taking the mickey out of me.So in summary, I'll leave it to the director himself.. `When I see a film, I love it when I'm entertained, when I care for the actors, when I share their emotions, when I'm scared, when I'm in love, but also if I learn a little something, if I have the feeling that I haven't seen something before, and that's what `The Name of the Rose' has.'

Eco approached this subject by concocting a series of mysterious deaths that occur in an isolated monastery, which eventually prove to revolve around a small coterie of disobedient monks who are partaking of a forbidden book.  This leads to the discovery of the monastery's great secret, a vast hidden library where the knowledge of the ages is being allowed to rot away by authorities who hoard the books on the paternalistic justification that the knowledge they contain is too dangerous for ordinary people to possess.  The library is a vast maze, and being lost in it is one of the novel's central episodes. (The maze theme, and particularly the library-as-maze, is one Eco shares with Jorge Luis Borges, and it feels here almost like the baton passed from one marathon-runner to the next.)    It is a novel filled with the love of books themselves, and dressed in a stunning evocation of one of the bleakest periods in the intellectual history of the last 2000 years.Jean Jacques Annaud's masterful adaptation of this book wisely retains some of the novel's elements, and transmutes others into terms far better suited to the medium of film.  Annaud creates the milieu of the monastery, bleak, dank, claustrophobic, almost drained of life, brilliantly.  (This film is the only way I'd ever want to visit a 13th century monastery.)  The suppression of individualism that is part and parcel of this monastic life is the obvious outward expression of the mindset that would suppress the product of centuries of human thought and writing.  Into it he brings William of Baskerville, excellently cast and wonderfully played by Sean Connery... a man who appears to be a monk solely because it is the only occupation in which he had the opportunity to study and exercise his mind. An obvious pre-cursor to Sherlock Holmes, William believes his eyes and ears, even when they contradict doctrine and the Official Line.  He is brought in by the Abbott to explain deaths and quiet the rumors... before the impending visit of a notoriously ruthless official of the Inquisition. To the Abbott's great dismay, William dismisses an easy explanation and instead seeks to unravel the mystery.  And coming ever closer is hovering threat of The Inquisition, which is eventually embodied on screen by the sinister F. Murray Abraham.Where Annaud's film departs from the novel is in shifting the emphasis away from the suppression of books as the central theme.  It remains a powerful symbol, but it is not required to stand on its own for the idea behind it. It is touched on in a wonderful scene where William first enters the library/maze and realizes what's hidden there, books he's heard legends of and longed to read his whole life, and he becomes totally giddy with the joy of this discovery.  But the seduction of the maze, the high-point of the novel, is a distinctly literary effect, and Annaud and his writers shrewdly perceived that it would be rather flat on screen.Instead, they center on the suppression of Free Thinking by the Inquisition, and the ruthless forms of terrorism employed to intimidate the useful minds into staying in their place, and thinking only what they are told. The human drama of the flames of the Inquisition read far more effectively on film than the intellectual drama of the imprisoned books, and that is driving force that makes the film, in its own medium, every bit as effective as the book.In all, this film is an entertainment for the mind as well as the senses, filled with remarkable performances an indelible visions.

For those who were not born then, The Name of the Rose was published in 1980, thus predating DaVinci by about 20 or more years. I must admit that I found DaVinci to be a mass market popularization of Eco's theme, in short a rip off. Still, it may be the popularity of Brown's novel which has resulted in Name of the Rose being brought back in a DVD version, and for that I am truly thankful.For a film which was not favorably reviewed by the critics, it is surprising how many reviewers 20 years later are giving it a 10. Either the film wore well or tastes have changed. I loved the film first time around and was delighted to find it on DVD. Certainly the screenplay had to deviate from the philosophizing of the book. It would have been almost unwatchably talkie had it not, and those of us who want to read the sermons/discussions can read the book. The film stands on it's own.The most ominous feeling for me, living in the religious and politically free thinking 21st century, was the realization that the church had such a grip on every aspect of life and thinking in the middle ages, and that any perceived repudiation of accepted Church dogma was deemed heresy and punishable by torture and a horrible death. That one group of people should wield such power, and the length they would go to to hold on to that power is truly frightening. The rigid class structure where the nobility and church owned the land which the peasants worked, and supported those above them while being kept down by those above, was very well conveyed in the film. Life was short and hard, health was poor and the plague could return at any time, carrying off those who had not been carried off by the incessant wars. Not a pleasant age to live. The period of the film is set just prior to the reformation. It is hardly surprising that the teachings of the various religious orders began to be questioned.

Inquisitions are the order of the day and the atmosphere of mistrust and misrepresentation which accompany such a fragile state, is expertly realised.Enter Sean Connery playing a Sherlock Holmes (`&#133;Elementary my dear Wat-shun&#133;') from the dark/middle ages, replete with a magnifying glass of sorts and a recognisable system of logical deduction. The story is a fine balance of complexity (easy enough to follow, but not too simplistic) with the inclusion of a number of sub-plots to keep it all ticking along nicely.

The story is an excellent mix of Sherlock Holmes-type crime thriller and religious criticism/commentary. I found this to be exceptional as the book was labeled as impossible to remake as a film and while the book is indeed better than the film, the film is certainly not without its charms.First of all the cast is pretty much perfect. Reading the book Sean Connery wasn't who I had in mind as the character but he certainly makes the character his own. His performance is for lack of a better word unique. He brings his usual indescribable something to the character which makes him almost instantly likable and believable. He delivers his lines in a confident manner that suits the character. Like in many other of his films his character is a teacher character but he does not seem to berate his pupil (Christian Slater) but allows him to grow on his own merely nudging him along. Even though not my first choice to have played the character I cannot find any other who would suit the part after seeing the film. Christian Slater plays the protagonist in what must be described as his break through character. His inexperience as an actor shows and once again suits the character who is also quite inexperienced in many ways. He portrays the change and ultimate conflicts of his character well enough and like Connery makes the character his own. Michael Lonsdale is pretty good as well and even though the character is not as well defined as in the book he provides the broad strokes in a satisfactory manner. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. does an excellent job in bringing Jorge to life and matches Connery's authority in their scenes together but once again the character is done in pretty broad strokes and you only get a small taste of what the character was like in the book. F. Murray Abraham's character is not like in the book and even though I was slightly disappointed by the film's portrayal of the character I understand why it was necessary to change the character for dramatic purposes. Ron Perlman who has since gone on to become quite a big star has a small role in this film and he does a decent job.The film thrives on its complex story (which is nowhere near as complex as in the book) and deep characterization of the main characters who are about as defined as characters can become without internal monologue. There is voice-over by the older version of Christian Slater's character but is basically only used in the introduction and end part of the film and at a few crucial moments. The fantastic characterization is also helped by the incredibly sharp and well written dialog which never gets boring or forced like you could have feared given the religious content. In many scenes the dialog was in fact so good that I got the chills. The film focuses mainly on the mystery elements but the religious elements of the film are somehow weaved into the overall plot but there were plenty more of these religious elements and factors in the book. Overall I think the film should have been at least 15 minutes longer to get more of these elements in but maybe thats just me. However, all the most important plot points (and a few sub-plots) are covered so in that sense the film is successful.Another thing that works very well is the atmosphere of the film which is very tense and mysterious. The tension is helped by the music which like so many other things in the film is quite unique and fitting. The set work is pretty simple but as it is a monastery you cannot expect the most flamboyant of sets. The sets work in their simplicity, however, and there is really no point of critique to be found in the set work. The lighting is kept at a minimum as well and once again this works in favor of the film as it adds to the overall tension. Sometimes the lighting is a little to dark but it happens so rarely that its not really a problem.All in all Der Name der Rose (or The Name of the Rose) is a wonderful film but what drags the film down ever so slightly is that it can some times feel a little rushed because of the amount of material it is covering and there were a few elements from the book I would have liked to have seen in the film. In general, however, the cross from book to film is very well done and the overall plot is very well depicted with many tense, frightening and interesting moments. The film is definitely one of Connery's best and it is mainly because of his performance that I am giving the film a 9 in stead of an 89/10 "},{"Title":"Great film based on a great book","Date":"17 January 2006","Score":"37 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I remember this film made a huge impression on me when I first saw it in the cinema almost 20 years ago.

It is a quite free adaption of Umberto Eco's novel, and if you have just recently read it, you may be irritated by all the deviations from the story of the book. But it is important to remember that to fit a 600-page, quite academic novel into a two-hour movie one just have to make adjustments. In fact, I have to admit that I think the movie is superior to the book. The book is very good indeed, but to my taste slightly too dry. The movie is perhaps more shallow, but it has a totally unique atmosphere and an exciting plot. Sean Connery does one of his best, if not the best, role as a combination of Sherlock Holmes and a medieval philosopher. Very entertaining indeed! If you buy the DVD, the extra material is almost as interesting as the movie itself. The almost two-hour interview with the director Annaud is very inspiring, and he really comes over as almost a renaissance man. Very thoughtful, yet energetic and with a real purpose to his work. I remember when I first saw the movie, that I felt I had never seen any movie which so convincingly pictured life in the middle ages.

In reality, Europe of the Middle Ages was dark, damp, and dirty, there was no middle-class, and the clergy and the nobility ran society like dictators. Consideration of personal hygiene was almost non-existent, medical practices were atrocious, and the search for knowledge was discouraged by the church. Aside from the great Gothic cathedrals, much of the architecture was comprised of either large stone buildings or small shacks for the peasantry. And religious fanaticism raged all over Christendom. If you weren't fearing for your life in the hereafter because of sin, you might be worried that the church would haul you in on charges of heresy. But there was one small consolation it was the period when some of the most beautiful books ever created first appeared by the artistic hands of monks in scriptoriums. This is the world of The Name of the Rose, the film adaption of the novel by Umberto Eco.The story concerns several murders that take place in a medieval monastery circa 1327. But this monastery is special (although essentially fictional) it contains one of the greatest and most extensive libraries in all of Medieval Europe. Not all aspects of the Middle Ages were gloom and doom. The age produced some of the most extravagantly beautiful hand-written books western society has ever seen. The large ornamented calligraphy was adorned by beautiful illuminations in the margins, artwork that surrounded the text. (The art of hand illumination has been subsequently lost to modern printing innovations.) William of Baskerville (Sean Connery), a Franciscan monk, and his pupil Adso (Christian Slater) arrive at this Benedictine monastery hidden in the snow-clad mountains presumably near the border of Italy and modern-day Switzerland. At this time, the Franciscans were a relatively new monastic order, their order barely 100 years old, as compared to the Benedictines that by this time had boasted an 800-year history. William and Adso learn about the death of one of the monastery's best illuminators who worked in the monastery's scriptorium. The scriptorium was the area of a medieval monastery in which monks copied, illuminated and illustrated books. The story becomes a narrative about medieval books, classical writings, and the power of thought--medieval thought versus classical (aka Ancient Greek) sensibilities. As William of Baskerville (so-named referencing Sherlock Holmes) begins to piece together the puzzle, he realizes that the death has much to do with the library and its books, and possibly one book in particular.Although this is a loose adaption of the book, the film The Name of the Rose is one of the best depictions of the Middle Ages. Unlike most Hollywood offerings concerning the same period, the actors in The Name of the Rose were probably similar to the strange-looking and care-worn monks that habituated 14th-century monastic life. Most of these people (save the two Hollywood actors Sean Connery and Christian Slater) are gaunt and less unattractive people occupying large drafty buildings full of stench and grime. Their lives amounted to sleeping, eating, working, and worship. Leisure was not just avoided, it was largely unknown. Their only solace is the beautiful Gregorian Chant that echos through the Church Sanctuary during morning and evening services.No one in this movie is particularly attractive, and there are even a character or two who will make you cringe. The cast, mostly made up of French, Italian, and American actors, is outstanding with a few notable standouts. Ron Perlman as Salvatore, a dim-witted hunchback who doesn't know whether he's speaking Latin, Italian or French is the absolute tour-de-force performance of the film. His portrayal is worth the price of admission alone. I didn't realize the actor was actually American until much later! Feodor Chaliapin as the venerable Jorge, an aging blind monk that does not let his age nor his blindness interfere with his expressing opinion gives a stalwart performance. Volker Prechtel as the stoic librarian and supervisor of the scriptorium; his character could give any modern-day spinster a run for her money. William Hickey as Ubertino of Casale, an exiled Franciscan who is strangely lovable despite his age and his dying teeth! And F. Murray Abraham (of Salieri fame in Amadeus) is also memorable as the historical figure Bernardo Gui, a true-to-life 14th-century inquisitor. You really believe you are walking in the 14th century among these people. But would you want to invite them for coffee?This is an outstanding film, granted not exactly escapist and definitely not for the feint of heart. Simultaneously, this movie provides a window into the world of Western Europe 700 years ago, when democracy did not exist, people were stratified, religious fanaticism the norm, and the world was lit only by fire. A compelling time and a compelling subject. Personally I love to study Middle Ages and its history and culture. Would I ever want to live back then? Not on your life. I'll use movies and books instead like the Name of the Rose.

It's all about the books and what they represents. This is one of my favorite scenes of all time among a couple of others from this movie.The rest of the cast seem to fit their roles about as well as if they were really the people they're portraying. Even a young Christian Slater is perfectly hesitant, unsure and timid, but fearless in the end having lived through and survived the nastiness of the Inquisitors and matured rapidly in the process.I prefer movies that make me think, they are the ones that have lasting value. Sure, a screwball comedy or action flick is a nice escape from time to time, but this type of movie, with its historical background, fascinating cast of characters and an intriguing, unpredictable story does more to justify the pastime of sitting still and watching a moving picture.I can understand why lots of people would have a difficult time with The Name of the Rose. Perhaps age, experience and whether you're a reader of books will determine how much you appreciate what's going on in this movie and why it's so powerful. It's not important to have read the book or not, having done both, it's a much easier ride watching the movie than reading the book. In this case, best to see the movie first and read the book afterward.This a movie that has remained on my top ten favorite list for a long, long time and I pull it out regularly and watch it just to appreciate why it was made in the first place even though I'm sure that puts me in a relatively small group when compared to the audience for most movies.

It's hard for me to say whether this is a better film or a better book, it's so close.The control of information is the representative theme .. the collection of information in a tower of power, the library in the fortress-monastery that is lost nameless in time. The political wheelings and dealings, the lust for information, the self-abasement to satisfy the goal of acquiring hidden knowledge ... all among the monks who are supposed to have the highest of ideals.Laughter is the focal point of the drama .. whether Christ ever laughed and whether laughter is divine or satanic, good or evil .. and the hidden knowledge that is lusted after is related to the lost volume of Aristotle's Poetics, On Comedy. The !? last extant copy !? of On Comedy is housed in this monastic library .. and someone has decided that anyone who reads this work must die .. that anyone who knows, with certainty, that the work exists, must die. Why? Because Aristotle is such a powerful intellectual figure that the monks who read his thoughts in On Comedy will be unable to make the right choice and reject his arguments.

One last thematic issue is the nature of libraries themselves .. no matter how much you try to make the materials accessible .. there must be gatekeepers and guardians to keep out the rats, to keep out the ruffians, scalawags and Visigoths, etc.The library at Alexandria .. the greatest collection of knowledge of ancient time .. burned.

The film is based on a book by Umberto Eco and apparently bears similarities to the popular book/film The Da Vinci Code. Having not read Dan Brown's book or seen the film version, I can't say whether or not that's true- but if it is true then Dan Brown took his influence from a good place. The film is basically a murder mystery with religious overtones. The Name of the Rose is set in 1327 and takes place in an Abbey. A man has been found dead and the monks have called in Franciscan monk, William of Baskerville, in order to uncover the person that committed the murder. The monks within the Abbey are disturbed as they believe the murder signals a Satanic presence within the Abbey; and this view is made all the more troublesome when more monks begin to turn up dead. William of Baskerville must solve the riddle before the Inquisition arrives to conduct their own investigation.The main thing I loved about this film was the atmosphere. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud ensures that the film is absolutely beautiful and the Abbey itself takes centre stage. The aging walls and many catacombs provide an intriguing place for a murder mystery to take place, and it is well used. The acting is fantastic and Sean Connery is brilliant in the lead role; giving just the right atmosphere to his character. He is joined by a young Christian Slater who plays off Connery well and their relationship provides the backbone to the film. The murder mystery itself is well plotted and there's always plenty going on to ensure that the running time passes quickly. The film takes a twist midway through and then we are catapulted into a labyrinth below the central location, and this again is well used. On top of the murder mystery, there's also an insight into the attitudes of the church and how members of it attempt censorship. The film boils down to a worthwhile and fitting conclusion and overall I have to say that this is a great film and comes highly recommended!

The film is centred around a magnificent but sinister Gothic monestary in the 12th century that is due to host a debate on the divinity of Christ between the Benedictines, Franciscans and Papal monks. However, unbeknownst to the outside world, a serial killer stalks the shadowy halls of the isolated abbey leaving a trail of dead monks with blackened fingers and tongues.Enter Brother William of Baskerville, an English monk brought in to solve the murders and determine whether, as many suspect, the devil is at work there. He uncovers conspiracy and corruption but his investigations are ground to a halt with the arrival of a fanatical inquisitor with a score to settle&#133; The first thing that strikes you about the film is how good it looks with cinematography and set design collaberating to create a claustrophobic and paranoid depiction of a monestary, the Escher-esquire library in particular is a treat and the scenes that take place there are masterfully suspenseful. The films use of striking colour and shadow is also extremely impressive, as is director Annaud's impressively complex, and at times expressionistic composition of scenes.The film's other main strength is its acting with Sean Connery in a career best role as Brother William, a man of reason in an age of madness, which he lends a deep psychological complexity and intensity to. Christian Slater is also very good as his naïve assistant whose existential angst about his purpose and his sexual awakening forms the emotional backbone of the film. The supporting cast is also excellent, a gallery of grotesques on whose faces you can literally see the corruption, from the sinister abbott to the fanatical venerable and hunchbacked heretic Salvatore. The only exception is F Murray Abraham, who hams it up cringingly as the inquisitor without revealing much about the characters inner drives.Overall, this is a beautiful, intelligent and thought-provoking film which questions the authority of the church far more effectively than potboilers like the Da Vinci Code.

In England Universal Education did not arrive until 500 years after the setting of Eco's The Name of The Rose.Between them,the Church and the Aristocracy clung grimly to the droit de seigneur,keeping the underclass under by denying it access to literacy and books,the tools of knowledge. Hidden away in the monastery at the centre of the movie are the books that have been given in to the custody of the monks to prevent the peasants improving their lot. Proto - Nazi F.Murray Abraham attributes a series of unexplained deaths to supernatural events in this era before The Enlightenment whilst worldly liberal Sean Connery and his assistant Christian Slater attempt to prove a more secular explanation. Signor Eco's 1980 novel was an imaginative masterpiece,but,like the later A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking was read more in the breach than in the observance,as one might say.The movie has made an excellent job of making a complex multi - layered work accessible. Set in a Europe in the middle of a mini Ice Age that would last for 200 years there is a distinct chill in the atmosphere.Breath hangs in tne air,skins are red and raw,clothes rough and uncomfortable.There is little joy to be found in contemporary life except perhaps for the Brothers in the closed community of the monastery in whose very exclusivity was to be found warmth of a sort. The shrewd and benign William of Baskerville and his energetic helper Brother Adso bring a brief touch of the outside world to this enclosed Order.They defy Orthodoxy and promote humanism to an extent that makes them persona non grata. The Name of The Rose is not an easy movie - which is not to say it is elitist or obscure,because it is neither,but it does require that you pay it your full attention in order to get the most out of it. Even if you have no interest in medieval history it can be enjoyed as a clever murder mystery in its own right.Mr Connery - possibly inspired by a role more challenging than many in recent years - is exceptionally good,young Master Slater - surprisingly perhaps - even more so.A fine literate script retains much of the meat of Eco's work whilst winnowing it down to a bum - friendly 2 hours or so.

It looks so dense, complex and claustrophobic. It was one of the most enjoyable sequences of the film. The camera-work, which is very good overall, is exceptional here.

Moreover, the viewer can sense a tense chilling atmosphere that hangs in the air as William and his student try to solve the mystery. Each of the characters have a distinct look which only adds to the mystery element.Though the story does involve intricate historical details, it is basically a whodunnit.

Yet, the details that are unraveled after each murder only draws the viewer further into the story.Connery is in great form as William. He pulls it off with ease. A teenage Christian Slater correctly portrays the innocence and naivety of Adso. F. Murray Abraham is commendable in a small role.

The only sights to relieve the eye in the entire film are some exquisitely carved stone doorways and lots of old bound folio leather tomes, like many which I have myself. (Note in 1327 these did not exist, but never mind. Maybe the budget could not stretch to vellum.) Everything else is like a vision of hell, and presumably that's what everyone thinks of the Middle Ages. There are some perfect performances in this film, such as F. Murray Abraham as Bernardo Gui the Inquisitor, and Michael Lonsdale as the Abbot (what's he doing speaking English? back in your French box, Lonsdale!). But the most spectacular performance, and the one which steals the film to my mind is that by Ron Perlman as Salvatore, a hunchback who is more interesting than all the other monks put together, and who speaks the most astonishing multi-lingual gibberish I have ever heard come out of a human mouth. I wonder if he were dubbed! Sean Connery is smooth and convincing as William of Baskerville, but better still would have been someone a bit more cerebral. (I kept expecting him to pull a gun from under his cassock and start blasting away.) Christian Slater is charmingly naive as William's young protégé, and probably just right for the part, though rather a tepid presence on screen. The chief importance of this film, though few viewers may have realized it, is that the main theme is based upon scholarly fact. There really was a Book Two of Aristotle's 'Poetics' dealing with the nature and philosophy of comedy and laughter, and it is lost, and probably for the very reasons which the author Umberto Eco suggests. There are some publications on this subject, such as Richard Janko's book 'Aristotle on Comedy Towards a Reconstruction of Poetics II' (Duckworth, London, 1984), based on a precis of part of the work which apparently survived in a treatise called 'Tractatus Cosilinianus', made in the tenth century. Certainly, Aristotle's comments on parody, ridicule, and mockery would have made members of the Inquisition nervous. Part of the surviving precis says '... there is a place for some mockery in comedy, since a reproach becomes acceptable if it is sweetened with wit. The joker aims to expose the faults of mind and body in his victims ...' Not what cardinals are fond of! After all, during the decades of Soviet oppression, the Eastern Europeans took refuge in subtle satire as a way of attacking the tyranny, and in the Middle Ages, it was the only way to deal with the Catholic oppression. So the Inquisition was not anxious for a manual on satire to be handed round as a guide for attacks on their sanctimonious prating and their vicious persecutions. Laughter really is a threat to the oppressive, since if there is one thing a sadist cannot tolerate, it is being thought to be laughable. Sadism comes from vanity, and vanity is too readily punctured by humour for humour to be encouraged or allowed. That is why stand-up comics are now being reined in and told they cannot make fun of this or that group, on the pretext of 'political correctness', but really to force them to submit to censorship by the humourless mediocrities who preside over every oppressive bureaucracy which has ever existed. After all, there is nothing funny about being mediocre, it is deadly serious, and so are the efforts of the mediocre to silence those of us who might laugh at their pretences and ridicule their power. It is rare for a major film to be made from an intellectual book, especially one dealing with fundamental issues of society. Will we see another anytime soon? Or will pigs fly first?

Deliberately, when two of my characters pass, conversing, from the refractory to the cloister, I write with an eye to the floor plan, and when they arrive they stop speaking (my translation). Though it was a bestseller so full of intricate discussions, historical and ecclesiastical allusions, and, of course, names, that many more may have bought than read it, The Name of the Rose is intensely visual. It's both visual and claustrophobic. The overall set, the monastery, is so small, and the possibilities within it so constrained and so few, yet so full as Eco has written them, that the right filmmaker had only to follow Eco's lead.Peter Greenaway (Drowning by Numbers, A TV Dante, Belly of the Architect) comes immediately to mind, because of Eco's labyrinth and puzzles; but so does the still active ninety-six-year-old Manoel de Oliveira (The Covent, The Divine Comedy, The Cannibals), who like the late Bresson sees religious pathways where the rest of us might not. I think the Rohmer of L'Anglaise et le duc, but also of My Night at Maud's, might have been an ideal translator of Eco's discussions, while the bluntness of the story's deaths, dangerous Inquisitor Gui, and the all-consuming final conflagration might have helped answer some filmgoers' problem with Rohmer. I love against-type casting, and might surely have cast Rohmer as this violent film's director.I vaguely recall liking the film, as just another movie, in 1986. The chilly mountain monastery on the big screen must have impressed. But Annaud and his four screenwriters diminish Eco's work to Sherlock Holmes in cassocks.Early on they wrest the point of view from Adso, lazily, to show the Abbot and aides uttering expository lines. Adso, young and old all at once because he tells the story years later with the perspective of age, unreliable and maybe-reliable narrator all at once for the same reason, is as pervasive and as absent as Boswell. His experience with the peasant girl comes dead center in the novel. Everything builds to and falls from it. This is ironic, tragic, laughable or (to be gentler) comical, because it's not his story. He's telling it. He puts her there. But it's not his story. So many years later there's simply no one left to stop him putting her there. Annaud & Co. make her something other than what both Adso and William, with the cruelty of their avocation, term her, a prostitute. Adso's obsession, his repeated use of the word love based on a single wordlessly grappling experience, without so much an exchange of names, wreaks biting satire upon celibacy. The girl's repeated appearances in the film, and her beyond belief escape from Gui, destroy Eco's satire, replacing it with the worst sort of maudlin.Gui, as Eco portrays him, isn't a villain. He's more like bad weather an unstoppable, unavoidable force. F. Murray Abraham plays him as a smooth thug who in movie cliché terms must fall. Eco dispatches him for Rome, with the Adso's doomed girl and Salvatore irrevocably in tow, before the conflagration precisely because he cannot fall.Eco's title for the book might have been Adso of Melk, but Italian publishers, he says, dislike proper names. Annaud seems to have wanted Eco's rose to be a rosebud. It's Kane's sled! It's Adso's girl! But Adso's superbly contradictory final line (I don't know Latin) is something like A rose gone has no name; we keep empty names.A rose is a labyrinth. Or, the Rose here is the Labyrinth? Shadow between its petals leads to its center. Annaud & Co. diminish the labyrinthine library. The crisis it entails begins in Eco's first few pages when the Abbot, portrayed more sympathetically, and as a wiser man, than in the film, challenges that the ingenious William should be able to deduce all he needs know about the library without setting foot inside it. Even though William fails to the extent that he must eventually enter the library and even return there, how could filmmakers, movie-makers, have thrown out this wonderfully Holmesian challenge?! Peter Greenaway might have build all else upon it. The difficulty of entry and close terror of being lost inside the library barely surface in the film.Other losses the significance of Arabic texts; the full impact of the running argument around blind Borges' disdain of laughter; any real sense of the monastery buildings' and rooms' locations in relation to each other with respect to the solving of the murders.Please don't chide me about the different demands of prose and film. I've written about them myself. When I closed Il nome della rosa, I knew I'd just read a beautiful film.I can't imagine that this will ever be remade, and maybe that's just as well.

Any story based on that premise should normally have a contrived feel to it, but this movie manages to pull it off quite well. William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his apprentice, Adso of Melk (Christian Slater), two Franciscan monks go to an isolated Benedictine Abbey to attend some sort of a Medieval theological conference. At the same time the Abbey is plagued by a series of unnatural deaths which most of the monks are willing to pin unto the devil and a prophecy. William is unwilling to accept this explanation, and with the help of Adso, looks for a logical solution. The cinematography, production design and costumes are brilliant and help us, the viewers, see why the period was called the Dark Ages. The social ills of the time - exploitation of the poor, suppression of free thinking or any kind of descent, Kangaroo courts, harsh punishments, misogyny, etc. - are all vividly brought to life. The movie does not have a single unimportant scene and yet its length also conveys the monotony of the monastery life.Connery does justice to the role of a well-studied, devout yet reasoning monk who commands the respect of even those who are against his way of thinking. F. Murray Abraham as Berdardo Gui, the Inquisitor properly inspires hatred in us and we also see why he inspires such fear in the monks. Slater portrays the learning curve of his character pretty well. The supporting cast of monks have been chosen as much for their ugliness as their acting ability. Collectively they give a creepy and repulsive feel to the Abbey and make us pity any young/handsome monk who may have the misfortune of landing there. There are only a couple of points to nitpick on. The peasant girl who portrayed Slater's love interest should have had a few speaking lines; there was no reason why she should appear to be mute. And, the set design of the library is obviously inconsistent; there is no way the sets we see as its interior would fit into a building the size of the set we are shown as its exterior.Its is a must watch for all period movie lovers and Connery fans.

Set in 1327 , when after a strange death in a Medieval Abbey, the Benedictine monks are convinced that the four riders of apocalypse are coming ; many of the monks fear that there can be only an evil, supernatural explanation . The abbey is in fear over the recent death of one of their young monks, a brilliant illustrator who was found killed by an impact at the base of a cliff outside . With the Abbey to play host to a council on the Franciscan's Order's belief that the Church should rid itself of wealth, William of Baskerville(Director Jean-Jacques Annaud was not keen on casting Sean Connery in the role of William of Baskerville, and a large number of actors were considered prior to Connery being cast. Some of those actors include Michael Caine, Albert Finney, Richard Harris, Ian McKellen) an intellectually nonconformist and respected Franciscan monk investigates a series of mysterious deaths in an isolated abbey. The Abbot (Michael Lonsdale) asks William to help solve the mystery as he is known to be a man of great intellect and a former investigator for the inquisition. As he is asked to assist in determining the cause of the untimely death, and is accompanied by a novice (Hundreds of teenage boys were scouted before the production settled on Christian Slater who was only 15 years old ). Meanwhile , there happens several murders and the young monk finds a mysterious girl (Valentina Vargas is the only female character in the film). This is an acceptable screen rendition of Umberto Eco's bestseller and the movie took 5 years of preparation . The picture contains thrills , suspense , mystery , sexual scenes , intriguing issues and results to be quite entertaining . Very fine acting by Sean Connery as a monkish Sherlock Holmes trying to solve a series of murders , he is fun to watch . Good support cast plenty of uglies , such as Elya Baskin as Severinus ,Michael Lonsdale as The Abbot , Feodor Chaliapin Jr. as Jorge Burgos , William Hickey as Ubertino Casale , Michael Habeck as Berengar , Urs Althaus as Venantius , Ron Perlman as Salvatore , Leopoldo Trieste as Michele Cesena , Vernon Dobtcheff as Hugh of Newcastle , Donald O'Brien as Pietro d'Assisi and F. Murray Abraham as Inquisitor. Jean-Jacques Annaud admitted to casting the ugliest actors he could get because he wanted the characters to appear real, based on the men in the village where he lived . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli , filmed on location in Bruzzo , Rome, Lazio, Italy and Taunus Mountains, Hessen, Germany . Impressive and spectacular production design by Dante Ferreti , as the monastery was constructed as a replica on a hilltop outside Rome, making it the biggest exterior set built in Europe since Cleopatra. Many of the inside shots were taken in the monastery Eberbach, which lies close to the Rhine. The catacombs that appear on the movie are private and belong to a small restaurant that the crew frequented on production. Evocative as well as thrilling musical score by James Horner . The motion picture was well directed by Jean Jacques Annaud . He spent four years preparing the film, traveling throughout the United States and Europe, searching for the perfect multi-ethnic cast with interesting and distinctive faces. The magnificent filmmaker Annaud creates yet another picture excellently directed and stunningly produced . Annaud directed particular films with almost no human dialogue such as ¨Quest for fire¨ and was an expert on animal movies as proved in ¨The bear¨ , ¨Running Free¨ about horses and ¨Two brothers¨ dealing with tigers . His most successful pictures were ¨The lover¨ , ¨Enemy of the gates¨,¨Seven years in Tibet¨ and of course ¨The name of the rose¨. It was 4th highest grossing movie of its year in France , though failed at the US box office, grossing only $7.2 million.

Some believe it is the work of the devil, others believe some people are just evil and it has nothing to do with the devil. Whatever camp you're in, you have to admit it can make for great entertainment in a novel or film. Murder mysteries always involve someone who is very good chasing someone who is very wicked. If done well they can be great fun, but also frightening if one imagines the events really happening. Most of these stories are set in present day or not too far in the past, and either in the city or a more isolated setting. Well in 1986 came this adaptation of Umberto Eco's bestselling novel, which is a murder mystery, only this one is set in 14th Century Italy at a monastery. These places are supposed to be holy, but in this story there is evil within it's walls. The period and setting are a refreshing difference, but they are not all this excellent film have to offer.Pros Strong performances from a great and interesting cast. Engrossing story. Dripping with atmosphere. Gorgeous cinematography. Suspenseful. Rich production design. Deliberately paced, which is perfect for this kind of film. Beautifully scored. Picturesque location. Good whodunit.Cons Script not as well structured as it should have been. Loses some steam towards the end.Final thoughts Be prepared because this film has an atmosphere so overwhelmingly grim, but this is one of it's charms. This is one film that has a lot of style, but also plenty of substance. It's a shame it didn't do all that well at the Box Office. True it may not be for everyone, but the movie isn't at all a failure.

But underneath all the moral observations and arcane Latin tags is an old-fashioned whodunit in the best Arthur Conan Doyle tradition, with Sean Connery portraying a Franciscan monk (transparently names William of Baskerville) who ingeniously deduces the truth behind a series of gruesome murders in a 13th century Italian monastery. The diabolical plot involves an unwritten book by Socrates, a labyrinthine tower riddled (pun intended) with secret passageways, corpses with blackened fingers and tongues, and the unwelcome attention of the Inquisition. Four writers are credited with the adaptation, and the film (perhaps as a result) is both literate and lively, effectively recreating the grime and severity of the Middle Ages but not above allowing the young novitiate Watson a fairly explicit sex scene with a comely young peasant lass.

I then was somehow weirdly attracted by the grim, mystic medieval atmosphere, the setting and the characters, without properly understanding what it all was about. And one scene cut deeply into my memory then ;). You know, the one with the girl...Since then, every time I thought about The name of the rose (the movie) I felt a strange attraction to it, thinking about how I should re-watch it or, probably even better, read the book. It's almost a mystery to me that it took me over 15 years to do that, until a few days ago. I bought the book and read it. I was so hooked by it, I still think about it a lot. It's a masterpiece. With the book still in fresh memory, the movie had some pretty large shoes to fill. The scenery is chosen extremely well, I actually can't imagine a better one. The monastery feels very authentic, the Aedificium in particular. It's inner labyrinth, the library, is also presented nice, different from the book but it works well on screen. The casting is excellent for most of the characters, though some, in my opinion, like Malachias and Bernard Gui don't seem to completely fit. The former is visually portrayed too cartoonish for my taste while the latter's accent doesn't fit in (Gui was French, not British). The issue with the accent only sticks out because the rest of the voice work is done so well. The different accents in combination with the many obscure and memorable characters (Berengar, Salvatore, etc.) capture the social complexity in the monastery well. The best of the cast, is (ofcourse) Sean Connery. This role seems to have been written specially for him, he IS William from the book. The young Christian Slater fits the role of his young apprentice also great. The already mentioned scene with Slater and the girl is one of the most erotic I ever saw on screen.What falls flat in the movie is the feeling of the political/theological complexity and tension described in the book. At times it feels like the cast simply is too small, most obvious in the conference between the papists and the Franciscans. The metaphysical dimension described in the book, the human indistinguishability between good and evil, between right and wrong doesn't even try to rise in the movie. Consequently, the movie lacks depth. The script further feels stitched together most of the time and it doesn't always seem logical (this doesn't really matter if you read the book, though). The acting, while good most of the time, isn't consistent throughout the movie. Some scenes should have been given a second or third take.The story (novel), the characters and the setup of The Name of the Rose build the fundament for an intelligent, intriguing and memorable thriller. The experience is diminished by a (at times) sloppy screenplay, that introduces a few conveniences too much. Depth is traded off for something that almost feels like a happy ending. None the less, it will stick with you, if you liked it or not. There just aren't (m)any movies comparable to it even 25 years later...

Even in the final shots mist still filled the air...The cinematography was excellent successfully creating a chilling atmosphere full of suspicion and dread. There were also a few graphic scenes that made the picture of medieval life seem realistic, but increasingly grim especially with the arrival of the inquisition.The cast all acquit themselves well with Abraham in particular making the most of the lines given to him. I didn't expect to like Connery, being such a well known face, but he played his part well.The fast pace of this movie inevitably means some attention to detail, in terms of plot and character development, is lost but the result is a gripping and melodramatic thriller which provokes both disgust at the hypocrisy of monastic life and sympathy for its chief characters.

A pair of monks who have taken holy orders, Sean Connery and his novice Christian Slater arrive at the monastery and are determined to get to the bottom of why a whole bunch of monks are dying there.Fans of the Brother Cadfael mysteries of which I am one, will like this film very much. A lot of it rides on the chemistry between Connery and Slater and the two of them play off against each other very well.You do get the feeling you really are seeing a glimpse of the fourteenth century, helped in large part by the actual location shooting. In fact much of the film is shot at an actual monastery in Germany that is still standing from that time period. In fact one of the things that I really marvel at is the reconstruction of the labyrinth inside the monastery which leads to the library which is where the riddle of these murders is solved.The medieval Roman Church is certainly shown as having many sides to it. One is represented by the monks who in their cloistered existence, saved, translated, and preserved a lot of the knowledge of the ancient world we have today. Unfortunately there's the other side of it, as represented by F. Murray Abraham and the Inquisition. A force determined to force conformity in Christendom and add to their own power at the same time.Our monks do engage in some very unmonk like behavior and that includes both of our medieval Holmes and Watson. The scene where a village girl seduces Slater is both amusing and quite erotic. Could never have been done back in the days of the Breen Code.According to the Citadel Film Series book, The Films of Sean Connery, The Name of the Rose flopped badly here in America, but in Europe was a smashing success. Possibly because the story a lot closer to home there and Americans had little interest in European middle ages.That's a pity because The Name of the Rose is a worthwhile film that can be appreciated anywhere on this globe.

Umberto Eco, who specialized in semiotics, must have been familiar with the ideas of Jacques Derrida, when he wrote The Name of the Rose, which puts forward the (subversive) ideas of poststructural deconstruction. Jacques Derrida in Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences claims that history in terms of structure must be thought of as a series of substitutions of center for center. Both Derrida and Eco recognize the lack of centered structure as necessary to allow unlimited interpretation. There has to be confusion and destruction of the abbey, which has represented a center haven for truth-seeking (epitomized in Jorge of Burgos who eats pages of the Aristotle manuscript in order to protect and preserve his notion of purity). William of Baskerville is presented as the charismatic intellectual who espouses Scholasticism in an attempt to understand reality from the viewpoint of a human being. The philosophical aspects of Scholasticism were not dictated strictly by a set of theological dogmas but rather worked with both faith and reason. However, both dogmatism imposed by the holy inquisition and contentious Thomism are subject to elimination as subversive forces constantly threaten the established frameworks (homo)sexuality, irrationality, doubt. The Aedificium and the monastery are destroyed by fire. Without the commotion, Adso may have received a definitive response. The confusion and Adso's unanswered question continues the novel's pattern of ambiguity necessary to invite interpretation and provide limitless possibilities...

It says in the introductory cadres of the film - a Palimpsest on Umberto Eco's Novel! Definition from Gerard Genette (1982) - Palimpsest examines the manifold relationships a text may have with prior texts ... In this regard it treats the history and nature of parody, anti-novels, pastiches, caricatures, commentary, allusions, imitations and other textual relations. Wikipedia can provide further extension on this definition. This is in essence literature in the second degree!Then came the pressure of semiotics - What is it all about? I have a huge library, some 10 000 volumes that I have purchased with my pocket money for many years on a row. My selection here is with David Crystal (editor) Encyclopedia of Language, where unfortunately Umberto Eco is not included as semiotician. By-and-large starting with Charles Peirce and Ferdinand de Saussure, we get here an updated scheme on Semiotics where subject matter is three-some or five-some1. Auditory or vocal language with speech, musical effects, vocal cord physiology, etc;2. Body language or non-verbal communication with A/ Visual mode with signs and symbols, writing, kinesics; B/ Tactile mode for deaf and blind with codes, proxemics, etc;3. Olfactory and gustatory signals which is bio-semiotics and predominantly models communication in the animal kingdom.I hope that my reflections haven't hurt anyone, not least the estate of the author himself. My humble origins doesn't give me a single chance to become celebrity like Umberto Eco.

Maybe it is because the book was originally in German, though I have not read the book, so I cannot really comment on that (and I am not so sure about the origins of this film, though I have always believed that it was an English film).The thing that stands out for me in this film is not just the setting, which is a very dark and dirty Medieval monastery where the actions of the monks are basically ignore by the inhabitants (there is a suggestion that one of the monks is a pedophile, and there is another scene where one of the main characters has sex, and even though the main character works it out, he says and does nothing about it). If our belief of the medieval monk is a pious and saintly follower of God, then this film goes about and completely destroys it.The Name of the Rose is basically a murder mystery, and Sean Connery, a Franciscan monk, comes along and begins to use his investigative skills to try to uncover what is going on. The murders, however, have a lot of religious undertones, and we have here a debate between whether laughter is actually spiritual or not. We have the Benedicteens, who believe that laughter is sinful and should be avoided at all costs, and then we have the Franciscans who believe that laugher is a gift from God that should be embraced and experienced. We even settle down to a theological debate over that very point.However, the film is about a book, or a very specific book, and that is Aristotle's second part of the Poetics, and that is the one that deals with comedy (which, by the way, we do not have, but we do have his first part, which deals specifically with tragedy). It is suggested that this book is actually in possession of the monks in their library, where they keep a collection of all the books that they deem to be dangerous, but because they are books, they will not destroy. However this book they consider to be exceedingly dangerous, and will go out of their way to actually kill anybody who as looked inside.When I was much younger I started watching this movie but ended up becoming bored with it because it did not portray the medieval setting that I wanted to see, and that is of shiny castles, beautiful heroes, and magical feats.

The film is well shot, well directed, with a neat script and atmosphere all of its own.Essentially, this is a film about Sean Connery's monk prying into hidden secrets, lurking in darkened corridors and shining lights into shadowy, cobwebbed corners. My first impression was what an ugly film this is the monks are invariably repulsive-looking (none more so than the hunchback played by an astonishingly good Ron Perlman) and the whole location filled with mud and grime. It's no wonder that a sex scene between 15-year-old Christian Slater and a beautiful woman is so memorable in the midst of all this drabness.Connery is Connery, of course - when hasn't he been? - and the mystery is sufficiently dark and brooding to hold the viewer's attention. Later on, the Inquisition show up (in the form of an evil F. Murray Abraham) and things build to a grand old climax. I'll admit that this isn't a perfect movie - it's a little too slow, a little too laboured, and a little overlong - but it's a more than decent one.

Writing of this quality and depth is rarely translated with such skill to film. The clash of competing ideologies, a fanatical brand of religious superstition on one hand, in direct conflict with rational logic on the other, makes for compelling cinema.Whether or not, such a progressive rationalist as William Of Baskerville could have existed in the early Dark Ages is open to question. Since the story hinges on this supposition, one has to be forgiving, because the result is riveting drama.Many strong performances make the film highly entertaining, not least, Ron Perlman's outstanding portrayal of the rat-catching, heretical hunchback. Connery is convincingly solid, as is Murray Abraham as a fearsome Inquisitor.Due to a graphic kitchen scene, one would have to class Name Of The Rose as adult historical drama, rather than an atypical Hollywood movie.

Based on the novel by author, philosopher, critic, extrodinaire Umberto Eco, the story combines a love of pop detective fiction like Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe, with an rigorous interest in mid-evil monastic ritual, philosophy, esoterica, and politics.A young monk is killed, and before the Inquisition is summoned, Sean Connery is given a chance to crack case as a wise but contentious monk, who uses early scientific method and deduction to reason out a case most are ready to claim as the work of the devil.Hidden passageways, mysterious libraries, forbidden passions, and an old conspiracy, all make there appearances without ever succumbing to so many of the cliché's associated with them.The only real problem here is that a true understanding of the films end calls for a pre-understanding of Philosophy and not just books that are written and why, but books that don't exist and what that suggests.What if comedy is was just as important to western culture as tragedy, how would this affect our literature, philosophy, and religion, down to our daily lives of sacrifice and toil? What if laughing was as beatific as martyrdom, and seriousness held in as high regard as fleeting joy. What if there were no highs and lows in culture, no or less distinctions between the sacred and the profane(the story begins with the murder of a monk known for his satirical illustrations). Well everything kinda hinges on that, but it's not communicated very effectively, these ideas make an appearance late in the script and unless you already know(SPOILER), that Aristotle's Poetics on Comedy was lost, and that we have only on the parts concerning Tragedy with which to base (for hundreds and hundreds of years, and amongst some still to this day) the absolute definition of the nature and purpose of literature and how to identify quintessentially a good work. The birth of literary criticism and absolutism with regard to western writing.Well the film asks the question which may be more interesting a proposition than the movie itself, still it's a fascinating intersection of genres, styles, and concepts, a torch lit labyrinth of ideas and gloomy monks with magnifying glasses.

He was a very good sleuth, and always surrounded by fashionable women. In The Name of the Rose, however, he is still leading us through a good detective story, but the gorgeous women are absent. There is a bodacious bad-girl character who dabbles in witchcraft and illicit sex with a lecherous gone-bad goofy priest, but that is as good as it gets. In this movie, Connery (as William of Baskerville, a Franciscan monk) has to butt heads with gluttonous and gloomy fellow monks and priests. Some of these men are crooked, corrupt and wearing very fancy gold-embroidered robes. Baskerville, of the plain-brown-robe-with-rope-belt of the Franciscan persuasion, is investigating why young monks are suddenly winding up dead as doornails. The supervisory monks/priests say, Why, those were accidents! Baskerville/Connery is not convinced. No, siree. Meanwhile, he is training his young assistant monk-in-training, Adso of Melk as portrayed by Christian Slater, in the arts of sleuthing and quiet discovery. Later, Slater engages in sinful lust with said bad-girl (Slater was the smart monk, not the dumb one as described earlier). You would be surprised what these monks did behind the scenes. Baskerville finds out the answers to his questions, and in the end goes off into the sunset to find another adventure. I miss the Aston-Martin and dashing black suits Connery wore in his James Bond movies, and I even miss Bond's old villain friends. The villains in Name of the Rose, however, were evil and corrupt priests who were literally getting away with murder and greedy mayhem. This movie was part of a college course about early church history, where we studied about different orders of the Catholic Church, how some stuck to vows of poverty and others lived lives of sumptuous wealth and wasteful, wicked days. 10/10.

Which, in itself, is fine, but the book was much more than that.Early 14th century Franciscan monk William of Baskerville (Sean Connery) and his disciple Adso (Christian Slater) visit a a monastery in Northern Italy; the Abbey (Michael Lonsdale) asks William to discover the truth about a monk's death. Other murders follow William unravels the mystery while inquisitor Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham) is more interested in finding someone to burn.Always charismatic Connery plays William as one third erudite monk, one third Sherlock Holmes and one third... well, Sean Connery. Slater's Adso is essentially a teenage Watson. F. Murray Abraham is all piercing stares and icy malevolence - after his arrival, the focus shifts from the murder mystery to the conflict between him and William.The movie goes to great lengths to give each secondary character a grotesquely distinctive look - some of them are downright monstrous, like Ron Perlman's repugnant, incomprehensible Salvatore. Production values are remarkable, sets convincingly damp and ominous.When you adapt a book - especially a complex one full of cultural and historical references - minor characters and subplots should either be given the proper time or cut entirely. It doesn't make sense to keep them just for the sake of it. The Name of the Rose doesn't always suffer from this tendency, but from time to time it does see the character of Ubertino - interesting in the book, here transmogrified into an obtuse creep whose antics are played for laughs.The debate between Franciscan and Papal delegations and the events concerning Dolcino and followers are handled confusingly, but admittedly it was difficult to give them justice in this medium. Shame, because they are part of the thematic backbone of the story.Although there is Adso's love story with the unnamed girl, the most poignant moment actually comes when a frantic, desperate William tries to choose books to save from the rising fire. There is no sense of triumph at the end, with a melancholic, downbeat coda which elevates the whole movie.7/10 "},{"Title":"a comparison of two best-seller adaptations","Date":"18 August 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" The Name of the Rose was a best-seller that made Umberto Eco a household name and in Greece allowed its' publisher to launch a series of very serious commented translations of politico-philosophical classics presided by a major-now late- Greek philosopher residing in Germany. The series was a intellectual triumph and a financial disaster which led to the publishing house been bought by a competitor. This national parenthesis aside one must point out The Name of the Rose as a book was much based on dialogue while Da Vinci Code in action. In the respective movies as in the books Wiliam of Baskervill was what we now term a liberal Catholic while Sir Henry Tibing was an avowed enemy of the established Roman Catholic Church. It is a major difference and obviously had to do with the greater negative or positive appeal of the latter film given the evolution of marketing and promotion techniques from the days of the name of the rose. The age that the films refer is also all important, in the age of the Name of the Rose the Church was absolutely dominant and even its' opponents accepted its' frame of reference while nowdays the Church, despite the efforts of the late Pope, is on the defensive to say the least, especially in the the countries where movie going is a massive social phenomenon. The Name of the Rose had two definite villains in the persons of Horhe of Bourgos and the Inquisitor while Sir Henry Tibing is a villain but with a cause which the others accept despite loathing and opposing the methods used. In many aspects the films are worlds apart but the secularized tendency of modern mainstream cinema makes films with a church related theme look similar in the same way that atheism and agnosticism unite all disparate religious denominations against them and give the impression of similarity to outsiders.

As you are stuck up there, you wish for a warmly welcome but the brothers either look like crazy people or criminals. Fortunately, your companion is Sean Connery and with his bravery and intelligence, he is the perfect help. In other words, the locations and casting are excellent.Next, the story is about a criminal investigation in Middle Ages. I think it's the oldest thriller I have ever seen and Connery looks very much like an ancestor of Sherlock Holmes! Actual filmmakers and screenwriters should remember that a thriller is about asking questions and seeking clues instead of chases and gunfight! But foremost, the movie is a sharp criticism of the Catholic Church of that time. Instead of being the voice of love, truth and charity, the brothers are cunning, liars, cupid, blind and exploit the poor. Instead of bringing a message of equality and education, the women are considered like nothing and they strongly believe in censorship. I don't understand how this church could reverse its values like this and I am as shocked by watching « Angels and Demons ». As this latter happens half a millennium later, you can say that Catholics haven't evolve for the better and it's then a stenching rose.For those who criticize actually Islam, they should watch this movie and learn how the most powerful church behaves at the same age.

It dealt with the so called secret writings of coded messages that are to be found in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, and which deals with a hidden secret that the Roman Catholic supposedly has hidden. The film was a flop in the United States Some twenty one years ago a similar phenomenon hit the U.S. and Europe. The Italian, Umberto Eco, wrote a complex novel about the early 15th Century in Italy, the Roman Catholic Church, the rise of the great monastic libraries, and the rise of the inquisition. THE NAME OF THE ROSE became the great best seller of the middle years of the 1980s. It was made into a film starring Sean Connery, F. Murray Abraham, and Christian Slater. And the film flopped in the United States, but was successful in Europe.The events of THE NAME OF THE ROSE occur about the year 1410 in North Italy. A series of murders occur in a monastery that has one of the finest libraries. The abbot calls his old friend, the humanistic William of Baskerville (Connery) to assist in finding out what happened - if the murders are by human hand or the work (as some have said) of the devil. William comes with his young acolyte assistant Adso of Melk (Christian Slater), and slowly finds he is facing two enemies. One is the murderer who is in the monastery, and whose motives are unknown. The other is an old enemy, the fanatical inquisitor Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham). Gui has had a previous run-in with William over a man William defended. William was tortured until he renounced his defense, and the man was executed. But in Gui's closed, evil mind once you defend a condemned heretic you are a marked man if you raise your head up again.The film follows William's struggle to solve the mystery and evade his old enemy's threats. It also follows Adso's romance with a local girl (Valentina Vargas) who shared his moment of love in the novel. In the end William does find the killer, but at a cost - the loss of the great library. Eco's novel, because it was a novel, could go into greater detail for the reader than the film could. While one picture is worth a thousand words, unless you read thousands of words you will not know what to look for in the picture. In Europe, where the medieval world is not too far from the modern in some cities (those that were not flattened in the two world wars, like Prague), one had the education to follow the story and see the ironies in the tale. 1410 is an ironic date, and few Americans understood that.In 1410 the Roman Catholic Church's center of operations was not Rome. Most Americans have never heard of the Avignon Papacy, which began in 1360 and lasted sixty years (until 1420). The French monarchy, in a moment of anger at a Pope, invaded Italy and grabbed his Holiness and brought him back to Avignon with the Papal Curia. This would mean that from now on the Papacy would be an adjunct to the French throne, and the rest of Western Christian Europe resented it. But nothing was done about it for decades. By 1410, to the French it looked like Avignon would be permanent. That year a movement began to sweep Europe. In Bohemia a reformer, Jan Huss, arose and created a national Christian church. This was fought by Avignon, and the inquisition was created to combat it. It did eventually kill Huss, in 1416, after a show trial. But the Hussites survived (and actually formed the first reformation - beating Martin Luther by a century).But worst was to come. The enemies of Avignon picked up on this heresy and said it was proof that the French Pope was the anti-pope. Soon there were two other Papal courts in Italy that excommunicated each other and Avignon. But after awhile the two Italian Popes realized how absurd the situation made the Church look in the eyes of the world. So they sent representatives to meet, and they created a joint resolution (and a new jointly recognized Italian Pope - with backing from the rest of Europe). Avignon was declared heretical - and the newly created machinery of the inquisition turned upon the original creators. After 1420 Avignon was an unpleasant memory (only revived as a threat first by Napoleon in the early 1800s and later by Hitler in World War II to control - if necessary - the Curia and the Pope in Rome).The irony of this is not noted by American audiences as much by European ones. If Gui had not died in the film (well merited as it is) he would have switched sides and gone after his former French masters.Also not noted is that the final irony of the story is the title - the rose is the young woman Adso loves and sleeps with. He never learns her name.The acting of Connery and Slater is fine, as is the performance of the doomed heretic (who has been feeding the locals against the Church's orders) Helmut Qualtinger. Abraham makes Gui a contemptible bully, but he does occasionally rant too much (though that is easy given the bully's nature). His death sequence is ironic too, as he tries to get help in his precarious situation from the peasants who know he killed their friends - he begs for their assistance and they don't come. Also note Fyodor Chailapin Jr (son of the great opera basso), as the blind monk. Certainly a fine performance for this elderly actor, best recalled for the dog-loving grandfather in MOONSTRUCK.

I haven't read the novel the movie is based on, but nevertheless, Der Name der Rose is an outstanding movie with few to none flaws. But what makes this flick so great? Above all, it's the fact that we get a historically accurate and shocking glimpse at the circumstances in medieval monasteries. There's nothing holy or in the name of God; most of the monks are ignorant or perverse. Then, of course, the actors in this one are magnificent, with Sean Connery shining throughout the movie and proving that he is one of the greatest actors alive; he brings the intelligent yet arrogant William of Baskerville to life. But one has to give the other actors credit as well, especially those playing the almost insane monks (Berenger, anyone?). Yet it is sad to see what has happened to Christian Slater in this one, he shows that he indeed is a talented actor, but today he ends up in crap like Alone in the Dark. The storyline is very intriguing (yet I don't know how faithful it is to the book), thanks to a great script and the film's perfect pacing. There's no scene that feels too long or too short; and the slower paced scenes are in perfect balance with the faster and more intense sequences. The movie also takes its time to introduce and deepen the characters. This, along with a dark and fascinating mood and a fitting soundtrack, creates an atmosphere that sucks you into the storyline. Honestly, I can't think of any flaws in Der Name der Rose. Congratulations, Monsieur Annaud. You have created a masterpiece.

He was not only able to make the character sympathetic/pathetic even though he was not likable but also interesting enough to inspire conversation. (Spoiler when Salvatore, now mentally gone after a night of torture, is tied to the stake to be burned, and the fire is light, he actually casually leans over and tries to blow it out, very child like, it's obviously not really registering to him what's about to happen.

This fascinating film plays(so well) with false concepts.We don't know really what's going on.Also we should remember,in Middle-ages the people believed that the devil was among them,living in the world,that he was the causing of the black plague or other diseases.The church took advantage on that,the famous inquisition appears,the church used believers as a way of submission. Religious people like Bernardo Gui(played by Murray Abrahan)remind us of the infamous spanish inquisitor-Tomas de Torquemada-Gui was a true sadistic,worse of all,he was the censorious of his time.Another sinister character is the blind monk Jordi(who condemned  a joyful way of life).William is a rational man,almost scientific.He is against repression and men like Gui.William represents the  free thinking,he loves books(Aristotheles).When he found out that the death -Spoiler ahead!-of the monks got to do with a forbidden book(poisoned pages) he is even more intrigued than us.The people who think s  that some books influence d  us in a way that could change our perspectives,like poison to our minds,are especially &#150;short mind-religious people(this movie shows that).The young novice(Christian Slater who proves that he can carry a picture) represents the pure innocence,he will find love in this horrible place.He is clever enough to understand and learn from his mentor.The young girl accused of witchcraft is one of the victims of a perverse system.This film has  memorable scenes,especially the last final scene.The name of the rose is a fascinating as reading Umberto Echo book , it is one of the greatest adaptations ever.I also find interesting how the film portray monks as a pathetic figures(behind the hood,secrets, conspiracies and pain)they are Doomed people.

Usually movies set in the Middle Ages -- or even in the 19th century -- miss a lot of details and, above all, sanitize or gloss over the hardships of those times. Name of the Rose is different is this respect -- here is the Middle Ages in all its squalor, ignorance, but also in its glory. It's poorly understood in these times, but many of the scientific and intellectual achievements of the Renaissance were actually borne of the Middle Ages, often from monasteries like the one depicted in this film. Math, logical reasoning, history, machinery, art and architecture were all fruits of this time period. That this film captures this as well as the Inquisition, racism, and barbarism of the period is testament to its quality.

First, I decided to complete Umberto Eco's first novel, The Name of the Rose, after having tried many times without success. Then, upon eventual completion (it took around two months),I re-watched the movie, which I had initially seen about 27 years ago.My general impression of the movie was that the writers hadn't understood the novel at all. The arbitrary narrative that they chose to select from the 600 plus pages had very little to do with the point Eco was trying to make (which seems to have been lost on Jean-Jacques Annaud and crew). However, considering that most people who watch this movie won't have read the book (and I was guilty of this on my original viewing), this film still works as the forerunner of medieval murder mystery movies.Both Sean Connery and an adolescent Christian Slater are great in their roles as Franciscan monk and novice apprentice, respectively. Connery as the Sherlock Holmes-like Brother William is especially ideal for the part. His penetrating one liners are delivered with classic virtuoso. Another positive point is that this movie doesn't feel dated, mainly due to the competent cinematography and colorful cast of assorted freaks.For those who have read the book and hold it in high esteem, this film will not hold much stead and will ultimately disappoint. The characters are all one dimensional, as opposed to the complex figures of the novel. Furthermore, the focus on the love interest for Adso is quite lame and the choice between the girl and the church that he makes at the end borders on cliché. There are a lot of minor characters who make a brief appearance for no particular reason, leaving the viewer perplexed.This is by no means a bad film. It's just not The Name of the Rose that Umberto Eco brilliantly and painstakingly created. The book has the potential to change our fundamental processes of thinking. The movie is just an interesting historical drama.

If you have only seen the movie, you will have no idea of the richness of Eco's novel. The movie only deals with the murder mystery (and it does this poorly) leaving aside all the philosophical debates and the esoteric minutiae that made the novel so compelling. The reconstruction of the era makes it look grim and depressing, and I don't think that was the feeling in the book. It's hard to think of a novel so poorly translated to the screen as this one (Reportedly, Eco is of the same opinion, and this is why he hasn't let other books of him be filmed).

It's just a metaphor, and I think it appears clearly both in the film and in the book. Maybe it's a misinterpretation from the final sentence of the film.William quotes William of Occam talking about Nominalism and they referred to a rose only to illustrate it. It's hard to explain (even now I don't understand it completely) but I'll try.. Let's begin saying that the last sentence of Umberto Eco's book is 'Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus', that more or less means, 'The beautiful rose is its name, we have all the names empty' (I repeat more or less). The words have a power that can not be denied. It's a rose (or any other thing) precisely a rose just because we named it this way?The fifth day ends in the book with a sentence from Adso 'From my only earthly love I didn't know, and never will, her name' (I'm translating from the Spanish version sorry if I'm not being very literal). They choose to end the film with this sentence, giving it a completely different meaning by this change. Eco was talking about concepts and words and the shape of thoughts (Adso ends the story not knowing if it has any sense, if it means anything) and Annaud made a lame love story of it.Nevertheless, I love this film and I don't criticise the other changes Annoud had to make. They were necessary. I like Connery and Slater interpretations a lot, specially when they interact together.Like they say in the beginning, it was a palimpsest, not an adaptation, and that means rewrite the story.

In form it is a mediaeval murder mystery, set in a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy in December 1327. The detective-figure is an English Franciscan friar named William of Baskerville who, accompanied by his young novice Adso of Melk, arrives at the abbey where an important theological Church conference is due to take place. A mysterious death has occurred- a young illuminator appears to have committed suicide by leaping to his death from the abbey walls- and William gains the Abbot's permission to investigate. Over the next few days, several more suspicious deaths occur, and it becomes apparent that something very sinister is happening and that William and Adso are in danger. William's name is of course a reference to one of Conan Doyle's most famous works, but Eco's book is much more than a 14th century Sherlock Holmes story. It is an intellectually complex work which also touches upon mediaeval history, theology, philosophy (Eco seems to have conceived William of Baskerville as a mixture of Holmes and the philosopher William of Ockham) and classical literature. An important part of the story is Aristotle's Poetics, a work which has had immense influence on the development of European literary theory. It is known that Aristotle originally wrote about both tragedy and comedy, but only the part dealing with tragedy now exists. Eco imagines, however, that one single copy of the part dealing with comedy survived, that this copy was to be found in the abbey library and that there were those who would kill to prevent others from getting their hands on it. Given the book's success, it was inevitable that a film adaptation would follow. Many of Eco's themes do not readily lend themselves to a cinematic treatment, but this film is far from being the sort of downmarket cheapening of a literary classic which so often results when Hollywood tries to tackle novels with a serious or intellectual theme. Much of the credit for this must go to the French director Jean-Jacques Annaud, a great admirer of Eco's book, who went to great pains to stay faithful to its spirit. The leading role, that of William, is played by Sean Connery. This was, apparently, a controversial choice in 1986. Connery's career was in something of a slump during the late seventies and early eighties. Few of his films from this period are particularly distinguished and he was even prevailed upon to play James Bond for one last time, something he had sworn he would never do. (The film's title, Never Say Never Again is said to be a sardonic reference to this broken vow). And yet, slump or no slump, Connery retained that essential part of star quality, the ability to take any part he played and make it so much his own that one cannot imagine any other actor in the role. Eco, who apparently disliked this piece of casting, would doubtless be appalled to hear me say so, but ever since I first saw the film Connery- intelligent, humane, sceptical and possessed of a fine logical mind- has been William of Baskerville for me. The film seems to have contributed towards reviving Connery's career as his next film, the crime drama The Untouchables, was a great success and brought him his only Oscar. A teenage Christian Slater does not make much of an impression as Adso, but there are a number of good performances in supporting roles- from F. Murray Abraham as William's adversary, the sinister and fanatical Inquisitor Bernardo Gui, from Feodor Chaliapin, Jr. as the Venerable Jorge, the abbey's aged librarian, Helmut Qualtinger (who died shortly after the film was made) as Jorge's creepy deputy Remigio de Varagine and Ron Perlman as the demented hunchback Salvatore.Annaud appears to have spared no expense in realising his vision of the book; the abbey we see is not a real building but rather an immense set built on a hilltop outside Rome. The action takes place in winter, and the film is notable for its bleak and sombre look, in keeping with the dark and sombre deeds which make up its plot. The film version of The Name of the Rose may not have the intellectual depth and power of the novel, but it is nevertheless an impressive piece of film-making. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Gripping Medieval Mystery Story","Date":"18 August 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I watched this movie more than ten years ago and liked it a lot and just last week I had the chance to watch it again on TV.

From the directing perspective, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud's realistic directing style and his brutally honest depiction of middle age monastery life and its downright grotesque people and oppressive atmosphere might put off some viewers, but I found it a nice change from modern day Hollywood cleanliness.The film does have a rather slow start but thankfully the intensity picks up around half way to the film as the murder mystery plot deepens.

Probably not as an ultimate expression but you may say that there's a mixture between thriller, historical movie, and mystery. We see Connery in a role which is refreshing from his usual action roles. I do not want to tell the story here (you may see other comments for that) but want to elaborate on the mood, style or temper you'll encounter when watching it. This temper is defined by a rather dark and mysterious surrounding and environment the movie takes place in simultaneously causing a distinct curiosity for the audience and interest in more of those dark details. Though the temper of the movie is not necessarily mood lifting you'll be caught by an outstanding set of characters and a plot of mysterious events that drags you into the fascinating world of a medieval abbey. And you'll be ill advised if you are looking for a 007 performance - this here is Connery, though very different, at his best and for the first time without a whig that he hated for his 007 performances anyway.Enjoy!

In that time, the Church was all-powerful, the Pope judged everyone and the Inquisition punished anyone who didn't obey the Church's will. The monastery was dark and life there was very limited. But not as much as surrounding people's life, getting scraps from abbots and monks. To satisfy their desires, they had sexual relationships with countrywomen and got rich through the lands seized by the Church. This was the life in Medium Age and it was on this scene that happened the crimes. Sean Connery, great actor of so many movies (like the recent Entrapment), performs a Franciscane that will solve the crime, like a true Sherlock Holmes. His pupil (Christian Slater, of Interview with the Vampire, but only 17 years old at the time), accompanies him on this challenge, like a true Watson. And he's the one who'll fall into temptations... Der Name of Der Rose is, much more than just a thriller, a real study about the obscure Medium Age, when any knowledge that would question the catholic faith was a danger and condemnation.

Don't dismiss it as being unfaithful. The intricacies of Eco's gothic novel, which in full Gothic tradition, borrowed from other novels (it can seem like plagiarism), would be impossible to transmit in this medium. Instead Annaud concentrates upon the sleuthian aspects of the novel, and adds some extra sub-plots and twists which require concentration, or a repeat viewing.         The film brilliantly portrays the power of the church in the middle ages and the way in which it had become corpulently rich, corrupt and an omnipotent organisation are shown here Lucien Bodard as Cardinal Bertrand is a perfect embodiment of how bloated the church had become and how it was determined to misinterpret Christ's teachings to preserve its wealth. In juxtaposition to him, William Hickey gives a wonderful performance as the lean Franciscan friar Ubertino di Casale, representing the original shape of the Church, as a group of mendicants and itinerant preachers.               The casting is truly inspired and there are some incredibly sinister characters, who through being morally twisted have become physically deformed. Their deformities mean that they are confined to a monastery. They take this opportunity to misuse their power over the people, and break their original monastic vows. Look out for Ron Perlman playing Salvatore, a heretic hunchback speaking in macaromics, who comes to life from among a room of gargoyles and haunts the abbey, eating rats and abusing villagers. Helmut Quattinger as Brother Remigio breaks the vows of chastity, and gives the eponymous Rose food for her to sleep with him. His line, I have eaten my fill and shagged my wick and I am unrepentant is a damning indictment of the church.           Sean Connery as Brother William of Baskerville gives a brilliant performance as a monk with Holmesian detective talents, who upon visiting a monastery for a convention ends up investigating a series of mysterious murders, aided by his novice, Adso von Melik(Christian Slater). The young Adso sleeps with Rose; she suffers greatly because of her sex and the church takes a dim view of women. The negative elements of the monastery are represented by Michael Lonsdale, the abbot who seems to be at times bewildered by events and at others frightened, Volker Prechtel as the librarian Brother Malachia whose refusal to allow Connery to enter the library is one of the most terse ways of saying no possible, Fyodor Chaliapin Jr. as the Venerable Jorge who is determined upon stamping out laughter and pleasure in both the monastery and the world. His performance as the physically blind & spiritually blinded Jorge is incredibly eerie and is embodies one of the figures of common mythology and story-telling (that of a grey and wizened old-man).              Connery's nemesis is F. Murray Abraham who stars as Bernardo Gui of the inquisition, and brings up an unwelcome aspect of Brother William's past. Connery and Abraham go head to head in a battle of wits, as they both attempt to solve the murders. Connery proves himself to be a versatile actor, in this role, telling Adso that he finds the place 'most stimulating' when the former complains that he doesn't like it. His positively childlike delight when he finds the hidden library is touching, as Annaud attempts to convey Eco's idea of the allure of an endless library. His wry comment Well Adso, it appears as if we are in a labyrinth is delivered tongue-in-cheek and with a notable sense of understatement. In this palimpsest of Eco's novel, Annaud has provided the viewer with a view of life in the Middle Ages that is highly credible, and with a damning critique of the corrupting influence that absolute power can have. The music, the sets and the characters, especially Urs Althaus as the sinister Brother Venantius and Michael Habeck as Brother Berenga, an obese monk who sings castrato and whose glands are not developed all combine to give a film which is thoroughly eerie and creepy and will leave you scared of monks and monasteries for quite a while!

Even though the book (and the movie) appear to be a serious picturing of medieval life at first, I couldn't help thinking Eco intended the story to be a satire of the absurdity of blind Church worship.

He is a great actor and simply marvelous especially in the scenes at the end when he is in the burning library and tries to save some of the books. The whole film creates an really medieval atmosphere and although nobody can be sure how life in the 14th century has been, this film shows how it COULD have been. There has been a lot of discussion if the film is better than the the book or vice versa but I think it's very hard to compare film and novel. I love Eco's novel most for it's philosophical parts but the film is mostly a whodunnit set back in the middle ages. There are a lot allusions that refer to the themes in the book (like the discussion about laughter) but they don't play an important role in the film. But perhaps you must have read the book to understand the title of the film and the novel. Umberto Eco is interested in nominalism and this plays an important role in the story. The Name of the Rose means, that the names of the roses stay alive although the rose itself does no longer exist. In the film the rose stands for the girl although Adson never got to know her name. I think it means that he still remembers her although he doesn't know if she is still existing or what had happened to her. She has become a symbol for him which leads back to the other interest of Umberto Eco semiotics. He said that he chose the titel because the rose is a symbol for many, many things, so you can interpret it in many ways.  "}{"Title":"_Better_ than the book - There!

Combining a complex crime story with the intricacies of the complex political situation in medieval Europe, postmodern philosophical reflections about the nature of truth and limits of reason, and a love story on top, the novel holds your attention from start to finish despite its complexity and numerous quotes (in Latin - translated in the back) and notes. The historical details about the political situation in the middle ages are quite accurate, when I studied history some years ago, the book was a favorite among several of my professors of medieval history.The movie adaptation is not bad and probably could not have been done much better without distorting the story, but it cannot live up to the book. Basically, the philosophical and to some extent the political parts of the book are left out and what is left is the detective story which is somewhat simplified, although probably not enough for people who have not read the book - this is probably the reason for Maltin's negative view of the movie. This is a general problem for movie adaptations, but often the adaptations make up for it in other ways. If you have read the book, it is very nice to put pictures on the places and faces on the characters in the book and watch the action in the way that only a movie can show it. The plot is quite close to the book, so you can use your knowledge from the book when you watch the movie. If you haven't read the book, you have to watch the movie very closely (or watch it twice) to keep tract of all the murders and characters.Generally, the movie is very enjoyable, and is highly recommended, especially if you have already read the book.

Books are relatively cheap to publish; an author can drift into detail to his heart's content sprouting off hundreds of pages of discriptive without having to worry about making it very clear to the reader.Trying to adapt such a book in its full glory would mean a film lasting about 7 or 8 hours at a cost of several million dollars. But who would honestly want to sit and watch that in one session?So what we have is a watered-down version that I presume tries to keep key points from the book into sharp focus on film.Connery is a 14th century monk, turned detective, called into investigate a murder at a remote cliff-topped monestry; ably assisted by his young aide, Adso Melk (Slatter)So far so Sherlock Holmes! What we have is a crime thriller seven hundred years ago. But what makes this movie stand out is not only the visuals but also the things we don't see.The visuals are really good - most of the monks at the monestry are not pretty to look at - hunchbacks & grotesques seem to fill every room, contrasted rather nicely with the rather angelic good looks of the young Melk.But its not only the actors who are not particularly hansome, but the monestry itself - gargoles, deep caverns, rat invested tunnels & mazes; dim candle light, damp walls and an overall feeling of cold & foreboding.Connery is well suited to play the monk - no dinner suits, Aston Martin cars & admiring girls here.But Slater too, deserves a mention, for his wonderfully underplayed role of the novice monk caught up in murder, deception, torture; and of course the love of a girl!The camerawork is very good, especially the lighting. The music too helped put us in the mood for some Dark Ages detective work.So I still haven't read the book and don't feel inclined to do so. Whether I'm missing out on something I really don't care.

This is all the more surprising since it contains what I believe to be Sean Connery's best - certainly his most surprising,  most atypical - non-Bond performance.  'The Name of the Rose' is, as far as I'm aware (and I'm willing to be corrected) the one and only time in his screen career where Connery has played a man of thought rather than a man of action, a man who depends on his mental rather than his physical prowess, a man who would rather talk himself out of trouble than fight, a man who acts like he's the age he is; and as this man Connery is entirely convincing - entirely. When Brother William is trapped in the burning library (and what other Connery character would risk his life over some books, for goodness sake) we are seriously worried he's an old man, how on earth can he save himself?  And indeed, he has to rely on others to bring him to safety.I have read a number of reviews and articles about this film, and not one has acknowledged the radical departure Connery made from his regular persona.  Perhaps this, plus the fact that, that same year, when Hollywood finally decided to salute Edinburgh's most famous ex-milkman, they chose to honour him for his lazy, charisma-reliant performance in 'The Untouchables' (of course, that was a big hit), is the reason why Connery has played it so boringly safe ever since after all, if people aren't going to notice when you do something different, why do it at all?  Thankfully, the British Academy (BAFTA), in their last brave decision before turning into the blandest of all movie awards, gave him top prize for this film, despite its b.o. disappointment.

Connery plays Father William of Baskerville, a Franciscan from the remote backwater of England, whose very name illustrates Eco's fond Sherlock Holmes references. Slater is William's young novice, an earnest and well-meaning sort who is a bit overwhelmed by the brutality of the killings and the circuitous theological arguments that come to the fore. Arnaud can't really film much of the book's subtleties, revolving around William's adoration of wisdom and the allure of an endless library, but he does touch on it nicely without bogging the film down. The cinematography and setting unblinkingly illustrate the morose and impoverished circumstances of the Dark Ages, when wisdom was hidden away and the poor were kept in ignorance and suffering.

I saw this at some festival back then, probably Tokyo, and walked out on it early because it was so heavy and dreary. This time I sat it out, at the Gaststeig great hall in Munich, but only with effort, being tempted to walk again several times, until at last It picked up some steam after the hot copulation scene I had missed in Tokyo, between a peasant girl in heat and Connery's naive young sidekick. At the time Connery was trying to cut loose from the pigeon holing of his James Bond image and this was the first major step in such a direction. In this murky shaggy dog whodunnit mystery in a medieval Italian monastery Connery plays a Franciscan friar wrapped up in a thick wooly cloak, who is called in to investigate a strange death in a Gothic Benedictine castle. Sean has an admiring young sidekick (Christian Slater) who refers to him as Master but ends up teaching the chaste spiritual master a thing or two about carnal love between man and woman. The relationship between Sleuthing Connery and awestruck Slater is obviously derivative of, if not actually a homage to, the more secular Sherlock Holmes doctor Watson pairing. Along the way there are dark intimations of homosexual leanings by some of the creepier monks, there is a hunchback of Notre Dame clone, the only character in the film who occasionally speaks bits of Italian -- and lots of bloody grotesquery as the murders in the monastery keep piling up until the killer can't keep pushing the blame off onto the works of the devil any more. There is a big thing about banned books in a secret library -- notably one by Aristotle that the church regards as Heretical, and F. Murray Abraham following up his borderline villain role as Salieri in Amadeus with a full blown villain role here as head inquisitor Bernard Gui (Pronounced gooey and he lives up to his name in spades) -- This revival was the center piece of an Arnaud homage and retrospective, and Mr. Arnaud, now a white haired senior citizen was on hand to accept a lifetime award.

The difficult plot of the book is preserved in the screenplay as well as can be expected, and more importantly, the dark and repressive atmosphere that was predominant during that point of the middle ages is conveyed convincingly.The complex theological underpinnings of the book are omitted, which was necessary. The major plot that remains is one that Arthur Canon Doyle would surely have liked for Sherlock Holmes to have solved, if Sherlock could have been transported back in time to the late middle ages. As William of Baskerville, an elder monk of the Franciscan order, arrives with his novice and assistant Adso of Melk, they soon learn of the recent death of a young monk of the isolated abbey, a death for which foul play of some sort seems evident. William quickly concludes that the death is more easily explained as a suicide, but that leaves unanswered the question of what would have compelled a young monk to take his own life, and why so many of the monks believe that the devil himself is at work in the abbey.A second body is discovered, with the exact cause of death being uncertain, but with mysterious discolorations found on the fingertips and tongue. When the assistant librarian subsequently turns up dead, William is able to infer, from his many astute observations, certain essential facts, the most important among them being the central role of some mysterious, coveted book. But he does not know who is responsible for the two deaths that do not seem to have been suicide, and being a learned man consumed by the passion for knowledge and a love of books, he will never be content until he has discovered what mysterious book could have led to so many deaths. He is prohibited, however, along with all of the other monks except for the librarian and the recently departed assistant librarian, by long-standing rule of the abbot, against entering the library.Soon his detective work is side-tracked by the original purpose for his visit to the abbey. A delegate of Franciscans arrive, soon followed by a delegate dispatched from Avignon by the Pope and complete with the Pope's personal Inquisitor. The trials soon commence, which are of a duplicitous nature, and which are facilitated for the convenience of the Inquisitor by the discovery of a fourth corpse. This time it is the herbalist, who was overheard whispering to William, at a time when William could not take leave of the trial, that he had discovered a strange book in the infirmary. When William arrives at the scene, the book is no longer to be found. Knowing that the monk who is accused of that murder is not guilty, William defends him openly in the trial, only to find himself accused of heresy, which is also for the Inquisitor's duplicitous purposes. The only hope that William now has is to discover the truth which is protected by the secrets of the library, and he must solve its riddles quickly, lest he end up on the pyre himself.This movie will be best appreciated by fans of the book, but anyone who has an interest of that period, or who simply likes a good murder mystery, will find this to be a very enjoyable movie, even if a second viewing is needed to sort out the players and to understand the sequence of events as they unfold. As I said, the movie is missing the theological underpinnings of the book, but the fact remains that very few movies are so successful at capturing the essence of the book from which they are derived, particularly in the case of a book as literary and complex as this one. I highly recommend this movie, and for anyone with a particular interest in the political and theological history of the period, the book as well.

The recent death of a monk may have been murder.An enlightened and well travelled man, William, with  Adson in tow, decides to investigate the death using a pragmatic, scientific approach, which goes against the logical thinking of the time. As more monks die William realizes that he is not chasing the devil but a common murderer. At the same time he is intrigued by the rumors of the Abbey's extensive, secret library of classical literature. Could the two be connected?With the arrival of his Fransiscan brothers, the Papal delegation and his old nemesis, the Inquistor Bernardo Gui (F. Murry Abraham), who, being told of the murders does his own detective work, William realizes that he is racing against time to find the murderer before events spiral out of his control.This is a dark film, full of grey skies, fog and shadows. The monks are either ugly, old or fat and in the case of Ron Perlman's Salvatore, simply grotesque.Visually The Name of the Rose stands out as the BEST period film made. The interior sets are incredible. You get a feel for what life must have been like, one dreary winter in the early 1300's. The acting is superb, especially Connery, who does justice to William's complex, quirky character. Michael Lonsdale is always solid, F.Murray Abraham is typically over the top.Where it fails, slightly, is in the writing, especially with the protrayal of Adson, who, essentially is the films main character (provides narration as well). He walks around being confused or concerned or both and is quite usless. The liasion with the peasant girl felt tacked on, as it did in the book.As an adaptation, the film works. The Name of the Rose is a complex novel with developed characters who have shared histories. This can't be adequately explained on film, so the writers did the next best thing, hinting at the relationships and focusing on the premise, which is simply put, a murder-mystery. I think they pulled it off.

William of Baskerville -- a name to conjure with -- and his sidekick Adzo arrive at a medieval monastery run by Dominican monks, rather like Monte Cassino.  The Dominicans were never known for their sense of humor.  Baskerville and friend are Franciscans, a different order of monk, characterized more by a sort of mystic love of things human and animal.  Since Baskerville is a Franciscan, there is immediate conflict between him and his hosts, one which, in the end, turns out to underlie in a complicated way the entire mystery with which the film starts, turning on the apparent murders of several of the Dominicans.  It's this mystery story which intrigues the viewer.  Who dunnit?  Baskerville, aided (and sometimes hindered) by his pal, young Dr. Watson, I mean young Adzo, exercises all of his ratiocinative powers to solve the case, using a magnifying glass, examining footprints for their unique points, figuring out ways to solve directions to the Musgrave cellar, I mean a labyrinthine library.  It's all rather neatly done.  Sean Connery is utterly charming.  Christian Slater is under more control than usual.  The monastery's inhabitants are right out of a Charles Addams cartoon.  Man, do they have odd haircuts.  And bad teeth.  And opaque eyes.  And some are obese and pale and given to homoerotic escapades.  In fact it could be argued that Baskerville and Adzo are the only two normal-looking folks in the crowd.  The mystery has something to do with a horde of forbidden books, including the second book of Aristotle's Poetics, hidden in a secret library.Then Professor Moriarty arrives and the whole structure weakens and shivers like one of Aquinas's arguments that prove the existence of God.  F. Murray Abraham plays it straight.  He's genuinely evil, and does a splendid job as Bernardo Gui.  Bernardo finds three people -- ranging from the misguided communist to the frankly psychotic -- guilty of conspiring with the devil and consigns them to the flames.  The burning is pretty gruesome too.  The agony isn't as prolonged as Dryer's Joan of Arc, but it's pretty horrifying.  But really.  Everything seems to go awry during the last third of the picture.  Adzo escapes the burning library but Baskerville is trapped in the holocaust.  The director cross-cuts between scenes of Baskerville having a philosophical conversation with the chief villain -- You can't expect to deny laughter is a human characteristic -- and scenes of people getting roasted outside.  Then Baskerville emerges from the holocaust that is the monastery with a handful of precious books from what has been described as the finest library in all Christendom, and this is treated as some sort of victory.It was during this period when Western civilization didn't have much going for it, except what literature had been salvaged from the ancient Greeks, and that was in the hands of the church.  The crusades were to bring us into contact with the Saracens who reintroduced the rest of us to additional Greek and Roman literature and science.  Algebra was their own contribution.  (I don't think I'll ever forgive them.)  The Christian church was one potent sociopolitical force.  Did Lord Acton really says, Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely?  It's been quoted so many times I'm not sure I believe it anymore.  But the church then wasn't the church we know today.  You could be absolved of a sin you committed by confessing it to a representative of the church and then doing penance, which often involved a financial contribution to the church.  After a while, it became possible to be absolved of sins you had not yet committed by paying for an indulgence.  You could then sell the indulgence to someone else, possibly at a profit.  Eventually there came to be a futures market in indulgences, with priests and monks hawking them like peddlers in the town square.  So crooked they remind one of today's inside traders and the CEOs at Enron.  Compared to them, these monks are pretty benign.  The movie ends on a wistful note, but not a happy one.

After he shot this medieval thriller and among the plans he made, he made the Bear (1988) with wild animals as stars and he got down to adapt the Marguerite Duras' novel the Lover in 1992 and however, Duras' works are difficult to adapt for the screen. No, back in 1986, to adapt Umberto Eco's voluminous book was no small matter. On top of the detective plot, the work comported a theological reflection and a philosophical richness. They could be sufficient enough to lead the viewer astray. Jean Jacques Annaud seemed very aware of it. That's why he preferred to erase the quoted topics for an investigation à la Conan Doyle with a passionating enigma which is arguably more accessible in the spectator's eyes. Like Christian Slater and to reassure oneself, we rely on Sean Connery's wisdom and insight because we move in an isolated and mysterious place where lives a gallery of disturbing religious characters. The whole is scattered with beautiful pictures and a certain humor adds to the interest of the film. The director also found place to denounce the Inquisition with its unfair methods. Umberto Eco may have judged the adaptation of his novel as too simplistic but the public gave it an ovation in 1987. If you are interested in Annaud's cinema, don't miss this movie.

I see there is great artistry there, it's very literate and the mystery element is strong, but it saps my strength to the very last. Connery is miscast because he plays it as nudge nudge wink wink detective fare, and film strains too hard to be some intellectual medieval musing on inquisitional power, berserker religion and the search for truth. Now I like gloomy moods, especially when part of some Gothic architecture, but even with the delightful weirdness of this monastery and the even weirder haircuts, I find it hard to sit still, such is the haphazard directing of the plot. In all honesty, the makers really would have been better off just making another Sherlock Holmes movie and setting it in a monastery. Now that would be fun......This wants to be a paean to Arthur Conan Doyle, a brain teaser and an observation on some tricky subjects, but the mix doesn't work, sadly, for me anyway.

Like Black Robe (set in 17th century Quebec) the film has created with amazing success a world with which no living person has any direct familiarity. Most of the acting is magnificent; even young Slater is somewhat credible. Sorry to say, much as I respect the talent of F. Murray Abraham-- and I respect his talent enormously-- I thought his scenes were a tad overplayed, especially where he is interrogating Qualtinger/Brother Remigio at the trial. It must be said that some of the plot-developments simply do not come across with much sense. For instance, the young monk's motive for committing suicide before Connery & Slater arrive is never really explained. For that matter, the reason for Connery's arrival is not really explained either. Evidently he is to participate in some way in the forthcoming negotiation between the Franciscans and the delegation from the Vatican, but this is not made clear.Most frustrating of all is the question of why-- if this infamous book of Aristotle is so damned dangerous in the eyes of Brother Jorge (played by Chaliapin)-- he allows certain monks to see it, and why he doesn't he just privately destroy it, since hardly anyone else is even aware of its existence. Of course, at the climax, he begins eating the poisonous pages, but surely he's had years and years in which he could have eliminated the book with less drama-- not to mention with minimal consequences to his own health.The character of Ubertino (played by William Hickey) baffled me. I never quite figured out why he was included in the story, least of all why-- if he is a heretic hiding from the pope-- he should come to the abbey just before the arrival of Father Gui. And why-- since he *has* chosen to come-- he can't simply hide somewhere on the grounds.

To do this, he used the well-worn genre of the cloak and dagger mystery through the character of a monk who is a combination of Sherlock Holmes and Father Brown.Alas! The makers of the film obviously didn't understand the purpose of the book for it became a tawdry imitation of a Conan Doyle yarn. You would be better off watching a re-run of the classic series that starred Jeremy Brett, the best and most faithful Holmes ever. With this treatment, the plot - thin as it was - became obvious and humdrum; quite unlike in the book when you felt that the detective monk was truly up against an evil supernatural power.In any case, the pleasure of the book was in satisfying one's intellectual curiosity especially in areas of medieval theology and history. Isn't it useful to understand the cause of the splintering of the Franciscans, one of the greatest religious orders of the Church, into factions led by the Spirituals versus the Conventuals? What was all the fuss about heresies in those days? What were the differences and similarities among the Waldensians, Bogomils, Albigensians and Cathars? How were they related to the early Christian Gnostics? How did they affect art? What's the difference between the art of Fra Filippo Lippi and Fra Angelico? Who was that Fra Dolcino who led a peasants' revolt a la Spartacus? How could the professors of the University of Paris censure a Pope (John XXII) and warn him that what he was teaching was heresy (and he retracted!)? He taught that the faithful do not gain the full beatific vision upon death and will have to wait until the Last Judgment before they could see God. He got this idea from a misreading of the Apocalypse.The Benedictine monastery was presented as filthy and sloppy which was far from the way it was described in the book. After all, the monasteries were the repositories and transmitters of the civilized aspects of the ancient world which were lost to much of the known world during the Dark Ages. Even the illustrations in Eco's book show the monastery in the story as an oasis of order in a confused era.Michael of Cesena, leader of the condemned Spirituals was portrayed badly as an ineffectual fanatic, almost senile, while in the book he had a magnetic personality that attracted Adso and impressed Fra William (Sean Connery).The rollicking humor in the book was passed over too as missing was that scene in the treasury of religious relics where Fra William of Baskerville cracked a joke about the holy skull of St. John the Baptist when he was a boy.

But the whole movie was basically a rehash of standard mystery and period film fare.  Although I enjoyed figuring out who, how, and why, it made the film seem to drag on with gratuitous sex and violence.-spoilers follow- This is the type of film that would be a decent movie were it not for the forcible insertion of a love story, which seemed so unrelated to the plot of the movie and so underdeveloped that it was more of a distraction. Perhaps they needed to reaffirm the heterosexuality of some monks.  Perhaps they wanted to give this movie some wider appeal.  Perhaps they needed to find some way to make this movie's title make sense.I mean, geez, call it something else, please.  The movie is about murder, laughter, repression, the Inquisition, religion.  That's the heart of the movie.  Don't make a title out of the last thing that the guy says, that doesn't even relate to the action of the movie.I enjoyed Ladyhawke more than this.

I rented it an evening and fell asleep. I had to continue watching it the day after.Nice idea, probably the book is great, but the film did not make it for me. The only character I felt affection for was the hunchback. The sex scene was totally unnecessary and I wonder why people in the movie insisted saying Adso is beautiful! Come on, the guy was not only ugly, but PATHETIC! He did not help his master, he did not think... Nothing.I liked Sean Connery though and the last 10 minutes are exciting, the rest of the movie was just plain boring. "}]
