Revenge films satisfy base urges in all of us. But, holy smokes, this crosses the line a little bit with the glorification of such....at least with the ending (which I won't give away but involves Sharon Stone's character).Along the way is a fun ride as the revenge-obsessed Stone hires Sylvester Stallon (The Specialist, a term for his bomb-making talents) to kill all the people responsible for her parents' murder years earlier.The villains are over-the-top, to say the least. One almost has to laugh out loud at one of them James Woods. Few people in his era (70s and 80s mainly) were better at playing despicable villains than Woods, and in this film he plays that role to the hilt. He also rattles off the best line in the movie when he tells some tourist to get a new shirt, too.The other villains are played by Eric Roberts and Rod Steiger. Roberts is nasty and arrogant all the way and Steiger - as he has so often since the 1970s - appears cartoonish in his over-acting.The film moves quickly which means it's very entertaining and some of the bombing scenes are quite memorable, such as a chunk of a condo building falling into the ocean.Even though the villains are really nasty, there are no good guys here, either. Everyone is seriously flawed, as is the message of the film. I guess this is one of those guilty pleasure movies they talk about, because I still enjoy watching it every five or so years.

In fact, it remains a fairly atmospheric thriller revolving around obsession and revenge.  But it's not as interesting as it may sound, thanks to the generally lackluster script and mostly unlikeable characters. Stallone plays Ray Quick, an ex-bomb specialist who works for hire.  After the movie's requisite prologue, he's in Miami working for May Munro (Sharon Stone), who wants him to kill three mobsters, especially the head mobster's son, Tomas (Eric Roberts), because they murdered her parents when she was a little girl.  Quick contacts her only by phone, they are to never meet, but he's admittedly intrigued by her and vice versa.  However, she's actually working for Ned Trent (James Woods), Quick's former colleague who's out for revenge.Action fans expecting bombastic and over-the-top action sequences should steer clear, this movie will be too sluggish for them.  The Specialist has no desire to function as a typical Stallone actioner.  There are no large-scale gun battles, fisticuffs, or car chases.  In fact, I gather Stallone received the role purely on the basis of his box office clout (and perhaps also his ability to brood and act generally depressed fairly well).   So what is The Specialist, then?  Is it a thriller?  Yeah, sort of, there are a few suspenseful moments, mostly pertaining to Stallone using his bombs to knock off the mobsters.  Surprisingly enough, the twist of having the hero kill the bad guys with explosives (Speed and Blown away came out the same year) works well enough, mostly because the villains' impending doom bears a certain inevitability that plays to the movie's advantage. But there's little else about the movie worth recommending.  The story doesn't make much sense; as soon as it's revealed Roberts' murdered Stone's parents when she was a child, I scratched my head in confusion.  He couldn't possibly be more than a year or two older than Stone, meaning he committed the murders when he was about, what, ten or eleven?  More likely, it appears the filmmakers are trying to pass off Stone as a twenty-year old bombshell.  Sure, Stone looks great (and I do mean great) in this film, but she can't even pass for thirty.The romance is unsurprisingly perfunctory and generic.  As soon as the hero and heroine meet, they almost immediately tear their clothes off and go at it.  This is neither romantic nor sexy, even with the undeniably hot Sharon Stone as part of this tryst.  I've always kind of liked Stallone, subpar an actor as he may be.  He's always had a fairly commandable screen presence, though he has yet to translate that to genuine charisma (which is what puts him considerably behind that other big lug, Arnold Scwarzenegger). Neither suspenseful nor exciting enough to recommend, The Specialist is of little interest to anyone except for Stallone and Stone fans (and maybe James Wood fans, who will either delight or wince at his maniacally over-the-top performance).  I'm still waiting for Stallone to revive his career with a big-budget action blockbuster, but I don't see it happening.  Hey, I'm one of the few guys out there who actually liked D-Tox, so I wouldn't necessarily say his career has gone down the drain.

Sly Stallone is a former CIA-attached Army explosives expert, Raymond Quick, skilled at focus detonations that blow up certain areas while leaving surrounding areas unharmed.  In 1984 he and his partner, Ned Trent, must blow up a bridge frequented by a Columbian drug lord, but a civilian bus enters as the explosives are set to go off.  When Trent callously goes through with the mission, Ray disarms the bombs, then beats up Trent before having him discharged from the Agency.Ten years later Trent now works as security chief for a Miami mafia chief who years earlier had a former underling named Munro killed - in front of the man's daughter, May.  May Munro now wants her parents' killers blown up, and she wants Ray Quick for the job.  Ray is initially reluctant, believing it to be a setup, but eventually accepts, and starts blowing up the three thugs responsible one by one.  But it is a setup - May Munro is in reality working for Trent, who is using her very real desire for revenge to smoke out Ray.  Quick, though, is too smart for Trent's traps - until Ray and May's passion heats up ad Trent gets the break he needs to finish off the both of them.The film's highlights are James Woods' over-the-top performance, the explosion scenes, and also John Barry's haunting score, fleshed out by Gloria Estefan's garish cover of Vicki Sue Robison's 1970s disco classic Turn The Beat Around.

He'd had hardly any experience previous to this film and thinking back to the film itself; it's no wonder it really turned out the way it did. A big budget and a big cast with a screenplay that wasn't terrible probably demanded a bigger and better director. I could kick around a few names like 'John Woo' but I won't get too into that.Fatally, The Specialist doesn't do right what it's supposed to do right. The camera work is bad (I actually spotted one instance of camera shake in this film), the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and badly executed, the dialogue is a bit iffy at best and is rather clich√©d at times and the stereotypes of Colombian drug lords are laughable. With the action scenes, the extras just sit up waiting to be hit and are poorly put together in a way that you can see Stallone's next move as he wins the punch-up from a beaten position. The dialogue put across via the recorded phone messages feels forced and they snap back at one another too quickly. The character played by Rod Stieger is a little too stereotypical and his pronunciation of the word 'you' like 'jew' can only be taken seriously for so long before a serious scene involving intense dialogue is broken up by a smirk here and there.What makes the film also rather cheesy is the editing at some points. Early on in the film, a character threatens Stallone at knife point and asks him a question. Cut to a reaction shot of a silent Stallone and immediately, the character asks the question again &#150; not even giving Stallone the time it takes to blink to reply. This was very noticeable and good editing, as they say, is un-noticeable. One other incident is where Stallone sneaks up on a pistol wielding guard during a hotel evacuation and knocks him out from behind in the lobby area. We keep on the same camera and pan as he runs away. From this, we see that for the entire time, people (extras) have been running right past, merely feet from the assault and don't even batter an eyelid at what just happened as Stallone runs off in the OPPOSITE direction.Every action film has its effects and this films' was poor. The blatant blue screen effect of the water getting closer and closer via the window as the suite breaks off the side of the hotel and falls to the sea as a guy waves frantically at the camera crashing towards him without trying to get away really brought out a long shake of the head from me. The fact when one of the bombs went off in the room, one guy fell down before the other was also laughable. These are the action scenes of the film and should be suspenseful and nerve-wracking &#150; not humorous, instead.If you're looking for a decent Stallone action-based film from the mid-nineties, avoid this and see 'Assassins' instead. That film's particularly large cast rivals this one and the direction and script are a lot better.

Even a good dosage of Sharon Stone in the nude cannot elevate this film above the level of crappola.The plot isn't worth commenting on. You just have a vengeful woman (Stone) hiring Sly Stallone to blow up a crime family who killed her parents when she was a child. By the way, does anyone else find it totally ridiculous that Stone's character is a child when her parents are killed by Eric Roberts & co., but now she's supposed to be all grown up and he still looks the same? Totally laughable.Anyway, just watch James Woods do what he does best. He goes way over the top with his portrayal of a former colleague of Stallone (in the CIA I think) now trying to help mob boss Rod Steiger hunt him down. Woods easily steals every scene he's in. He looks like he's having a blast with the corny dialogue.My favorite sceneWoods and some hit men are on their way up to Sly's hotel room to waste him. About four of them jump on an elevator, and just before the door is about to close, a couple of senior citizens try to get on with them. The man is wearing a god-awful brightly colored shirt, and woods not only tells him and his wife to get lost, but also insults him about his shirt! You can just tell Woods ad-libbed the line about the shirt just as the doors were closing on the old couple. Truly hilarious!The rest of the film besides Woods is terrible. Stallone never knew how to say no to a bad film, and that is why his career has bottomed out. Stone bounced back with a big role in Casino the following year. Woods is also in that one, and once again, he steals every scene. At least Casino was good, though!The Specialist is worth about 4 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.

What he also does that is good is making his material more interesting than it deserved to be, much has been said about the scene with the shirt and for good reason. Eric Roberts is pretty good also, he doesn't have anywhere near as much to do and his character is rather one-note but somehow Roberts does bring some intensity and menace whenever he appears. The scenery is lovely too, the sex scene was appropriately steamy and John Barry's score is the other of the two assets most worth noting about The Specialist. Barry was one of the all-time great film composers and I have yet to hear a bad score from him, and the music for The Specialist has his typical lushness, beautiful harmonic writing and moodiness, these things may seem out of place for a film such as this but actually it works. Unfortunately very little else works. Sylvester Stallone is not the best of actors but as an action star he showed great charisma. Here he is very wooden and mumbles his way through his lines. Sharon Stone also flounders, Stone has shown she can be good(she is brilliant in Casino) but she does look awkward and there is the sense that her heart wasn't really in it, which makes her character's predicament difficult to engage with. Regarding the chemistry between them too, the only time where it works is in the sex scene, everywhere else you'll struggle to find any kind of passion. Coming off worst was Rod Steiger, giving a performance so embarrassingly over-the-top it was like watching a cartoon, which was completely out of kilter with the rest of the film. The characters have no real depth and personality, the most colourful character was James Woods's and his performance itself has a lot to do with it. The dialogue has its moments, all of which with Woods again, but on the most part it's very weak, often lacking sense and flow and often aimless with far too much talk. Story-wise, the lack of originality concept-wise can be forgiven(revenge thrillers often have that but it's not always a bad thing) but for it to be plodding, laughably implausible and at times incoherent is less forgivable, as well as parts being so predictable any suspense and tension is severely diluted and having parts that have little to no relevance. Other than revenge, you don't have a clear idea as to what the heroine's motivations are. The action sequences lack any kind of momentum or excitement and just looks so awkwardly staged and passionless, a few are so ridiculous that it brings unintentional laughter. The direction is flat and with the vibe that he didn't know how to direct a thriller, and visually only the scenery really impresses, some of the colours are nice but others are garish and the film in terms of photography and editing does often look like direct-to-video quality. Overall, Woods, the shirt scene and the score are great, Roberts, the sex scene and scenery are good but the script, story, leads and Steiger are just bad and the film on the whole is mediocre. 4/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"This explosive action drama is a dud.","Date":"11 February 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" I'm surprised that The Specialist was a box office hit, despite all the negative reviews. The Specialist is a movie to forget for all the cast involved, particularly Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, James Woods, and Eric Roberts.Sylvester Stallone is former CIA bomb expert Ray Quick (a laughable name for a character) troubled by a past mission from 1984 which involved the bombing of a South American drug dealer. In the bomb blast a young girl is killed, but his partner Ned Trent (James Woods the only film's saving grace as the villain) is determined to see the mission through. Following a violent confrontation between Ray and Ned, Ray vows to end Ned Trent's career in the CIA. Ray makes good on his promise to have Ned dismissed from the CIA, and Ray later resigns and disappears.Fast forward to Miami 1994, where a mysterious woman named May Munro (Sharon Stone) hires Ray who is now a explosives hit man to kill Tomas Leon (Eric Roberts), his father Joe Leon (Rod Steiger) and other members who murdered her parents years ago. Ray reluctantly agrees but finds himself attracted to May. After Ray kills one member of the Leon family, Ned Trent resurfaces to help Tomas Leon in tracking down his former CIA partner Ray.The Specialist is one of Sylvester Stallone's disappointing movies. He is very wooden in this movie. Sharon Stone seems to be replicating her past roles from Total Recall (1990), Basic Instinct (1992), and Sliver (1993) as the mysterious but sexually charged woman but here she wasn't anything special. James Woods was the movie's only saving grace as the unhinged ex-CIA bomb expert looking to seek revenge on Ray. James Woods' Ned Trent oozes nastiness at every turn, aggressively threatening people at gunpoint and being extremely rude and abrasive. Eric Roberts did a decent job as the creepy mafia thug Tomas Leon.Considering this movie was a box office hit, I ignored the negative reviews and still decided to give The Specialist a go.

In the meantime, Ray's former partner Ned Trent (James Woods) is on the Leon family payroll and is seeking his own kind of revenge on Ray. As Ray executes Leon's soldiers one by one, his attraction to May boils over into a steamy encounter in the shower - which the primary reason why one may view the movie, a prelude to an explosive finale. The movie was very bad except for the steamy shower sex scene between Stallone and Stone.Although the director wisely kept his camera focused on his buff, semi-clad stars and the film's spectacular effects, the somewhat silly and incoherent story.As for the performances,I think that Stallone still has difficulty speaking his lines as though he was still playing Rocky while Stone is stuck with her Catherine Tramell-like portrayal.Finally,this is movie is good for people who love action films regardless of the plot.

But it was a failure for him, being reduced to an atrocious movie with Estelle Getty as well as a movie that is named after the most coveted prize in acting Oscar. Cliffhanger got him back into the game, though only for a brief shining moment. It pretty much all ended with Judge Dredd and Daylight, both substantial failures in many aspects. But I believe that it was The Specialist that sort of started the downfall for Stallone after a successful year in 1993. While it technically counts as a hit, so many things go wrong in it.Departing from over the top solo efforts, The Specialist tries to steer Stallone in a different direction in this slightly erotic but mostly derivative revenge thriller. Twists and mayhem ensue, yet it never quite does much for us to be honest. 10 years after a bombing that gets him kicked out of the CIA, Bomb expert Ray Quick (Stallone) is in Miami waiting for his next targets on the orders of May Munro (Sharon Stone), who wants revenge on the men that killed her parents when she was a child. The men are made up of the Leon family in Joe (Rod Steiger) and Tomas (Eric Roberts), both who are vicious and cold blooded to May.Old friend turned enemy Ned Trent (James Woods) overlooks the situation, though he knows that Ray can kill just about anybody without really trying. While killing some associates of the Leons, Ray gets a little too close for comfort for May and soon becomes personally attached to her past. Despite accomplishing the necessary killings, it isn't quite over for Ray and May, who still have to deal with Ned before they can get away. Plus, one of them is not telling the truth to the other, so it will be a matter of who gets who in the end.The Specialist hardly represents the worst of Stallone, but it's closer to the bottom than the top to be honest. An unusual film even for Stallone, The Specialist is darker and more subdued for the typical Stallone film. Sadly, that's where the film loses us in trying to rebuild Stallone's image despite him retaining muscles for a role that definitely didn't need it other than one erotic but hopelessly pointless scene. Moody but cheesy, The Specialist tries hard to be a throwback revenge film but ends up getting tangled into too many webs and doesn't deliver the necessary thrills.Surprisingly based on a series of novels, I'd have to imagine that the novels at least seem more interesting than this joyless action picture. For what the film tries to be in a dramatic thriller, the end result makes it cheesy and depressingly routine for Stallone. The script mostly plays like a series of puzzles that never seem to make sense, though the film tries hard to fit them. The only enjoyment you'll get is the many ways that Stallone kills his targets, which sadly provide only some pleasure when they pop up. Without those bits of overkill, The Specialist is an empty spectacle full of fireworks but no thrills.The screenplay wants us to buy into the various twists and turns, but eventually they'll leave your head either shaking or sleepy, though it wouldn't matter because the script runs out of ideas halfway through. When the movie goes through its targets, it's as if The Specialist seemed to stall and just wanted to end with even more fireworks than shown before. Eventually, it gets tedious to get to a finale that sadly is as big of a letdown as seeing James Woods and Rod Steiger being conned into a film made for Stallone and Stone. Woods does his best to inject the movie with life, but even his hammy performance can't cover his lack of enthusiasm for the role.Woods chews the scenery and rarely gives it back &#x96; that is until Stallone comes into the picture. His lack of conviction hurts his role greatly, giving us a character that looks good on paper but often seems underwhelming and lackluster. Stallone distances himself from being a macho action hero in The Specialist, yet the look on his face makes you think otherwise. He gives us enough mystery to give us an occasionally interesting character, but even he can't hide his muscles from becoming a distraction. The lack of background story on him makes us even less interested, not to mention that Stallone isn't what he used to be.Stone fits the manipulative woman well, but that's a role she's been known for her whole career. She certainly has the body and looks, but she doesn't have the brains to pull off a part that Kathleen Turner did well in Body Heat. While her intentions are modest, it's the plan in action that makes Stone's character less than believable. Steiger is more hammy than Woods here, yet he seems less interesting because he becomes irrelevant in the long run. Roberts either seems too old or too beat up to pull off the beautiful tough guy, lacking any sense of morality and becomes a distraction for The Specialist.Some of the action pieces can be fun, but since they aren't the focus of The Specialist, they seem less than stimulating to be honest. A few exhilarating moments are negated by bad twists, dull characters and an atmosphere that's more tacky than mysterious. I suppose setting the film in Miami had something to with it, for it seems that the cast had more fun off the set than on it. Barry's music is better fit for a romantic drama, not something as mysterious or dull as The Specialist amounts to be. The Specialist gives a few cheap thrills, but it simply never does much for its characters or atmosphere.Grade D+ "},{"Title":"James Wood is outstanding","Date":"28 March 2012","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Full of entertainment.

The plot is rather implausible and in retrospect, it's basically a series of explosions following in a hopelessly episodic tone (boom, bang, boom). Despite the lack of genuine sophistication, it has an engaging easy-on-the-eye appeal to it that making it reasonably enjoyable. Even so, there's a pretty cover but little substance. While some scenes are quite clever others have that `Hollywood-ish' quality to them that doesn't make them all that believable. But then again, movies are a form of escaping from the real world- right. The glamorous cast is a pleasant diversion with a series of decent (if un-remarkable) performances. Sylvester Stallone acts in `Rocky' mode for the most part. Fairly one-dimensional but this is a role he does well. She lets her nudity do the acting for the most part, but Sharon Stone is always great as a `femme fatale'. James Woods gets the best lines and shows the most charisma in his part. Eric Roberts doesn't do much with his role, nor does Rod Steiger with an unconvincing German accent. The movie gets plenty of erotic sass from some scenes that seem soft-core porn scenes that seem pointless but are well executed. While it works well as a mindless action flick, it would have been better had it had a touch of old fashioned gloss.  It's an adequate example of it's sort- the big budget summer blockbuster, but there's nothing particularly remarkable about `The Specialist'. It's good if you're into that sort of thing so I would rate it as being average. My IMDb rating 5.3/10.

Just off the top of my head, here are some of the features of this turkey. Sly Stallone mumbles so badly that only about 5% of his dialogue is intelligible (though this is probably a plus, given the quality of the writing).Sharon Stone is nice to look at but her acting starts off bad and gets worse in a hurry. Her character is so unlikeable I cheered up when Woods slapped her around. Rod Steiger's accent, which I believe is supposed to be Cuban because he pronounces you as chew a la Scarface, comes and goes. James Woods plays a parody of himself (this was actually the most entertaining thing about the movie). They show Sly working out, and all he does are ballet-like stretches to show off his bod, and it was not a pretty sight. He is so over-pumped that there are alarmingly bulging veins on every inch of his body visible. Stone and Stallone (has a nice ring to it, huh?) have no chemistry--during their big sex scene, they look extremely bored instead of aroused, as if they are about to doze off but the only thing keeping them awake is to make sure their buff bodies are displayed carefully so they look their best on camera.  Continuity is terrible-Sly's character adopts a fluffy grey kitty, which I guess is supposed to make him sensitive (I was just worried he'd crush it accidentally) but in a scene towards the end, the cat is dark brown. I give a grudging point towards the kitty not being killed by the Columbians or Woods--the one thing that I didn't see coming, because every time Sly came home looking for his cat I expected him to find it nailed to the wall or something equally hideous. Woods does have a great scene (a couple, really) where he does a little trick with a pen and some plastique to frighten his office staff. I also laughed at the way he'd constantly be yelling Shut up! to characters who hadn't even said anything yet.The movie is, I have to admit, one of those that is so bad, it would qualify as one of those 'love to hate it' movies that you sit around with your friends with to watch and make fun of. Worth renting if 1. you are a Woods fan and find him entertaining in any movie no matter how terrible it is or 2. you have a free rental coming at the video store (or both of the above, like me). If you can't stand all three of the principal stars, skip it by all means.

(Don't worry he is a good guy underneath, it is Stallone after all, he won't kill innocent people, takes in stray cats and gives up his seat to pregnant women on buses) May Munro (Sharon Stone) contacts him and wants him to kill the three men who killed her family years ago, who work for the Leon crime family, headed by Joe (Rod Steiger) and his son Tomas (a fun Eric Roberts) Their head of security Ned (A brilliant scene stealing turn by James Woods) Just happens to be Ray's former partner.Ray Quick has to be the blandest and dullest character had played at this point. I'm not sure if he was bored in the role, but he sleep walks his way through the movie. Like with 'Cobra' we get shots of Sly looking mean and moody behind his shades, or intense and moody as he works on a bomb. Lots of posing as he listens to Stones voice over and over as he stalks her. Lots of posing not much actual acting. Sharon Stone does, what Sharon Stone did at that point of her career, look good and take her clothes off. Eric Roberts (how did this man not have a bigger career?? I'd much rather watch him on screen than his sister) is a lot of fun, and actually under used. Steiger is surprisingly under whelming, which is a shame. But it's James Woods who this movie belongs too!! He is simply fantastic, and the movie is s lot poorer when he is not on screen. So once again, for the second movie in a row, Stallone is completely overshadowed by his costar. Like Wesley Snipes in 'Demolition Man', James Woods not only steals every scene he is in, he walks away with the full movie!! You could argue three with John Lithgow in CliffhangerAs with Nighthawks and Demolition Man, Stallone had scenes cut featuring the villain (This time Woods) and more shot with himself (the scene with the thugs on the bus, and the one where Roberts threatens Sly with a knife) at the last minute. It made no difference, Woods still stole the movie. Despite a relatively short running time, it actually feels a lot longer than it is. An interesting note on this is David Fincher was set to direct this at one stage. Stallone liked Fincher, and wanted him, but he was overruled by the producers, because of the failure of Alien 3. Instead they went with Luis Llosa, who had directed the straight to video 'Fire On The Amazon' with a Sandra Bullock and Sniper with Tom Berenger in 1993. Whilst Llosa's career went nowhere (he only directed 2 more movies after this) whilst Fincher made the mega hit Se7en a year later.

It's a super exciting flick, cause it's different from a lot of other sorts around that time, the thrilling climax almost bringing shades of the finale in The Professional. Stone, a woman controlled by a mafia family, responsible for killing her parents, enlists the help of CIA bomb specialist, Stallone to take them out one by one, Steiger saved for last. This is perfect for Stallone, playing another loner type character who's methods of assassination are dangerously impressive, Roberts demise for one. Woods who used to work alongside Stallone in the bomb disposal business had a falling out, when Woods went AWOL on a job. Woods, sacked from the agency is now working for Steiger as well as the police department recognizes the work where the scene is set for the re acquaintance of two arch rivals. Featuring some nice broads in lingerie, The Specialist is fun all the way, where it's great to Stone as a revenge driven woman, who falls for Stallone, the chemistry between em, almost void. Stallone, might as well been a mummy in that briefly erotic sex scene. The baddies are great, Roberts almost mirroring that scene in Final Analysis, when he confronts Stallone, only he isn't smiling.

Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining.If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen.Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8.

This was made when Sylvester Stallone was in his prime in my opinion. He made some classic films in the 90s. One of my favourite movies of the 90s is Demolition Man.This is not one of his best movies, but it is still a very good one. In case you don't remember it, the story is about a guy who is a trained killer hired by the government who goes into retirement after an innocent person gets killed by mistake. He gets hired by a lady who saw her parents get murdered when she was a little girl, to kill the guy who killed her parents. He is the son of a mafia boss. The problem is, Stallones old boss now works for the mafia.The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a cheesy action film. It's alright but some of it is comical. Sharon Stone plays the lady that hired him and she does a great job in this. But then back in the day I liked her as an actress. She has made some great films. Eric Roberts plays the guy that Stallone is after. Eric is really good at playing a bad guy... although I think he was really good in Best of the Best.

With the exception of Cliffhanger and Demolition Man, the vast majority of Stallone's post-80's work is forgotten and even resented by some. But The Specialist (along with Assassins & Daylight) features some of Sly's best work. Big budget films with slick scripts, lots of thrills, and great co-stars. The problem with Stallone's 90's films are that Sly isn't playing an over the top, ultra violent action hero. His characters are subdued, introspective and grounded in realism. So in return, many find themselves disappointed by his 90's work.Like Banderas in Assassins, Stallone's co-star James Woods steals the show in The Specialist. He chews the scenery up and is as electric and volatile as ever. Any time James Woods in on screen you're going to be drawn in. He's just that awesome. Another great actor in Eric Roberts pops up and does a devilishly good turn as a baddie. Sharon Stone is Sharon Stone. She gets naked, shows off her bazookas, and cries a lot. Which isn't a bad thing. The Specialist isn't one of Sly's best films, but it's entertaining and better than many reviewers would have you believe. I think Sly's 90's work just gets better with time.

This was the first time pairing of Stone and Stallone. Unfortunately the two do not spend much screen time together So as a result of this, the movie looses out on few marks. The viewer would watch on in anticipation however the pair meet after half the movie completes. But their first meeting does not evoke much excitement either.To me the movie was very reminiscent of Luc Besson's 'leon', due to the similar scenario. However there are differences and one should not make comparisons. Despite this the first scene set in Columbia also reminded me of a similar scene from the movie 'Scarface'. I could not help noticing these connections and I'm sure there would be many more if observed closely.What surprises me the most is that I was so indulged in watching the movie that the notes I made was limited. I found the phone conversations between the two leads very intimate and erotic. That was a high point for me. These scenes really developed more anticipation in me to looking forward to seeing them meet. It helped me to sympathise with Sharon Stone's character. But I found it difficult to relate to her experience of loosing the family as in that specific scene she was very young. I'm unable to understand as to why it took so many years for her to decide to take revenge.The plot is not groundbreaking on any standard, but Stone and James Woods presence enhances enjoyment and sustains the viewers attention. Sharon Stone entices a bomb expert to avenge her family's murder. Initially Stallone is unwilling so Stone decides to go in herself by befriending Eric Roberts, the son of mafia don 'Rod Steiger'. Eventually Stallone decides to make the move. He has three targets to kill which he accomplishes with a variety of unique bombs. However later the tables are turned when Stallone discovers that he was set up by Stone as this was a plan between her and James Woods to apprehend him. However this does not prove easy to accomplish as Stone develops feelings Stallone as the two have become close.The setting of Miami in Florida was very suited to the movie's theme. The nightlife and locales were pictured very nicely. This added to the movie's appeal. Initially it is difficult to feel interested with the plot as the plot progression is at a slow rate. This was because Stone's character development takes up much running time. However after 30 minutes the pace picks up. The explosion scenes were filmed very uniquely and the different methods used were very hilarious. It urges one to watch on in anxiousness. The background score was appropriate to the movie and the it used at the right moments. Sharon Stone is given the opportunity to wear a variety of different clothes. She has never looked beautiful. It really suited her image. In my opinion she was the correct choice for the movie. Rod Steiger gives his impersonation of Tony Montana and Eric Roberts displays his good looking body. James Woods overshadows Stallone in yet another fantastic performance. Every time he appears it is a treat to watch him. His dialogue delivery is perfect. Stallone takes a back seat and effortlessly plays it straight. His practical involvement is restricted but he never dissatisfies.

My favorite scene was where Stallone gets completely angry with a guy who blocks a seat of an old lady and teaches him a nice lesson. And there is a scene where Stallone and Stone get to be in the shower together but that is more like an example of how not to pair up someone. Perhaps a major drawback in the movie is this pairing of Stallone and Stone.Sylvester Stallone was either given an incomplete character or Stallone simply chose to play him as a silent man with no expressions. It is difficult to tell whether the role became what it was because of Stallone or was it some fault in the creative path of the director and the story writer. But this character neither inspires nor does he invoke any sympathy from the viewers. You can identify with Rocky and Rambo and be inspired by them or feel sorry for them but not this character. The character is too lifeless.But there are some really decent effects in the movie. The action may seem extravagant at times but considering this is meant to be an action film, this aspect can always be excused. In fact, sometimes it is needed for a movie to be enjoyable that something unreal should be shown.

James Woods makes adds some hostility and a pulse to this melodrama with his wisecracks, outbursts, and foul-mouthed banter as the villain. But what's with the late Rod Stieger and Eric Roberts fronting as Cuban mobsters? C'mon, here. The strange thing is, they make it work. The action sequences such as the Sly kicking ass and taking names while encountering a couple of thugs on a bus and throwing one out the window, a hotel room explodes and collapses into the ocean with the bad guys still in it, and the funky way Sly sets traps for the bad guys gives this movie redemption. However, the characters in question could've been a little bolder, a little more gunplay is needed, and I have a major beef with discrepancies in the May Munro story. She looks 35, now if her parents were killed when she was a little girl, shouldn't Tomas be a tad older(he looked the same age in her flashback) The Specialist would've been a great movie if the plot was better explained and more intense.

Now that I've seen The Specialist, I must apologize to the movies' current sex symbol.  No, I haven't changed my opinion concerning her talent, but I now realize that a lack thereof does not mean Ms. Stone has nothing to offer.  To the contrary.  She has much of which to be proud, and, in The Specialist, it's all on the screen.  You see, Stone wears this short little black dress, an outfit that emphasizes her fabulous figure and even her beautiful face.  She looks terrific, which, alas, is the only reason to see The Specialist.The muddled thriller finds Stone as May Munro, a gorgeous babe whose parents were murdered by mobsters.  Now she wants revenge and hires Ray Quick, a former CIA agent played by Sylvester Stallone, whose specialty is explosives, to blow her enemies to pieces.  The culprits, mob boss Rod Steiger and his swaggering son, Eric Roberts, are not about to go quietly, and, of course, they don't, although, as expected, they do go--kaboom, that is.The explosions are pretty good, but there's nothing quite as explosive as Stone in that short black dress.  Her acting isn't bad either, but then who wouldn't look like a professional thespian when sharing the screen with the wooden Stallone and the scenery chewing James Woods.  Even Eric Roberts, an actor whose performances in Runaway Train and The Pope of Greenwich Village are tributes to ham, is subdued, and, therefore, effective.

I grew up with the film and it is still one of my best favorite action Stallone films! People seriously,simply don't understand what the movie is about. It's an action thriller, revenge Flick! The film is misunderstood and it is different Stallone film than in any other action films he played. The Specialist is not a masterpiece, the greatest or the best action film, but it is solid and good. It is an Entertaining action thriller from the beginning to the end.Stallone plays an trained Ex CIA agent who kills accidentally in Bogota, Colombia a wife and a kid and the bombing goes awry. I loved it how a CIA agent went trough hell, than he leaves the business and becomes a gun for hire. I love the character Ray Quick, I even memorize Stallone's Character! He is a trained henchman an Ex Special Forces The Bomb Specialist expert and Ex CiA Agent turned mercenary for hire, I love that! In this movie Stallone doesn't use a hand gun or any machine guns trough whole film, but he uses his expatriate, high explosives and hand to hand combat to kill a mobster and corrupted cop who was once a promising CIA agent but killed an innocent people and set up Ray!Stallone's character is well done written, he has a heart. He refused to kill innocent people, women and children, when he set up the bomb in Miami to kill Tomas Leon, inside was May and the bomb explodes, Ray cared and run to stop the bomb but he was too late. Stallone goes to the funeral of the woman identified as May Munro, he mourns and he is filed with quilt with killing an innocent person again. On a bus ride, Ray gets out of his seat and offers it to a pregnant woman. The people haven't see that or noticed, how a good hearted person the character is. He even took a cat under his wing. I love Ray Quick I don't care what anyone says! This movie has always been flawed with it's screenplay, a powerful score, lush cinematography and a solid cast. It has plot holes, but I still love it. I love the twists, the action sequences, the erotic's sex scenes in the hot tub, this scene really never bothered me. The special effects were great, the bomb explosions. I absolutely love this movie. It is very stylish, sexy and explosive. Stallone and Stone were perfect together. The Miami scenery was awesome. The music score was amazing. And the action was intense. Sylvester Stallone is truly an amazing actor and a truly a great talent. Also James Woods gave a powerful performance as Ned Trent a vengeful a hired assassin and a corrupt cop! Sharon Stone did a wonderful performance as a drop-dead beauty! I love the bus ride scene! Ray Quick gets out of his seat and offers it to a pregnant woman, only to have a young hoodlum take the seat instead. Quick calmly beats the crap out of the hoodlum and all his friends, throwing one of them out a window (not open), and then re-offers the seat to the woman. This scene has no bearing on the plot, but helps us get to know Quick. It is awesome powerful scene! Why I love this movie? I love it because in this movie Stallone doesn't use gun or machine guns but he uses his expatriate, high explosives and hand to hand combat. The Specialist is the most Underrated Action Thriller. I love Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct to another action thriller The Specialist and I love James Woods playing a villain in this movie. This was the only action movie that Stallone made in 1994 it was success but it turned in to one of very underrated movie and honestly I don't care.This movie is, apart from the film music, as a whole a must-see for action movie lovers with erotic scenes, built in smoothly. The double role of May makes the movie richer there IS a plot possible in these kind of movies!. Action abound and well distributed over the time. Eric Roberts and James Woods play their roles at the same high level as Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. I see originality, in the sense of action the highly developed explosive devices-do hey really exist? CIA will know.. A flaw ,which I do not understand up to now, is that the getaway boat from M&M seafood seemed to be so readily available. The goofy trick with the telephone in the Fontainebleau Hotel as well, but those are not disturbing details. The movie has a steady pace and ends with the Miami Sound Machine!. Best scene is of course , the intimate scene in the hotel. Superb entertainment! Two of Hollywood's biggest stars combine fiery action with steamy sensuality in The Specialist. Sharon Stone, a drop-dead beauty with a fatal past. She's sworn death to the mobsters who murdered her parents and she's decided the method of their disposal blast 'em- one by one- to kingdom come. She also knows the right man for the job cool-fire ex-CIA explosives expert Ray Quick (Sylvester Stallone). That is your basic plot! I am giving this film a 8, because what the hell, this film deserves it! I love this film it is my best Stallone fifth favorite film!

A huge number of people were involved behind the scenes too. So do we get end product? No.Stallone goes through the motions &#x96; the illogical and unnecessary violence, the contrived stunts, the flat delivery and the lack of facial expression.

But like so many other films that have virtually nothing going for them somehow it kept me watching. There are 3 caveats to that statement - firstly, it was on TV so I hadn't wasted any cash renting it out, secondly I didn't actually make it to the end, but if it hadn't been for an inconveniently placed ad break i'd probably have watched on, and thirdly I am mentally ill (or at least I must be for staying up late to watch this).I don't know if this is due to my snazzy new TV but somehow it looked like it had been filmed on an HD home video camera. Perhaps the extra clarity of the screen just served to expose the awfulness of the cinematography. There were scenes, particularly one in a bar, that looked like they could have been straight out of Home & Away. Strangely though it wasn't even an HD broadcast, so it could really be that this film is, after all, that bad.Anyway, there's not a huge amount to add to what has already been said, Stallone is just Stallone, as is Roberts (as in he's Roberts, not Stallone.. if you see what I mean). Steiger (head of the Leon family) is about as menacing as my mum. Woods hams it up quite well all things considered. Stone is awful, but in this company looks like she should be up for an Oscar, as should the loud shirt that is the recipient of the best line in the film when Woods comes out of a lift (you'll have to watch it just for that).It's worth watching because it is sooooo bad, and you will laugh out loud many, many times, so on that basis I recommend this movie wholeheartedly (but still can't bring myself to give it more than 3/10).

Ray left the Agency after a mission to blow up a South American drug dealer went wrong, resulting in the death of an innocent young girl. Ray is now working as a freelance hit man, and is hired by a young woman named May Munro. (M. Munro? Is this evidence of Sharon Stone's Marilyn complex?) May wants revenge on Joe Leon, a Miami gangster and drug baron, who was responsible for the murders of her parents. Ray has a personal interest in the case as his former CIA colleague Ned Trent is now working for Leon, the two men have become estranged, as it was Ned's ruthlessness that was responsible for the girl's death.You can work out the rest of the story yourselves. Actually, there isn't much story to work out. Just one big bang after another.The film was directed by Luis Llosa, the man who a few years later was to be responsible for the awesomely bad Anaconda, one of the nineties' greatest examples of the Ed Wood school of film-making. In 1994, however, Senor Llosa was a mere freshman in this particular school and had not yet mastered the art of making a truly awful movie. His chances might have been improved had he been able to secure Steven Seagal as his male lead. The producers apparently offered Seagal the role, but turned him down when he demanded $9 million to star and direct. (If I were a film producer I would happily pay $9 million just to keep Seagal out of one of my movies, but that's another story). Deprived of the services of Hollywood's most wooden leading man, Llosa was forced to turn to Sly, who is just not in the same league when it comes to the noble skills of Bad Acting. He has even been known occasionally to resort to Good Acting (although, admittedly, not in this film).Llosa did, admittedly, direct Sharon Stone to a Worst Actress Razzie, but he can claim little credit for this, as the Razzies frequently have less to do with recognising truly bad films than they do with settling old scores and cutting tall poppies down to size. After the success of Basic Instinct, few poppies in the early nineties can have been taller than Stone, and the Razzie was probably a way of warning her not to get too big for her boots. Certainly, her performance here does not involve much Good Acting, but it is a perfectly adequate one when one considers that she is not being called upon to portray Lady Macbeth or Hedda Gabler but the glamorous heroine of an action-thriller.There is, in fact, little Good Acting anywhere on display here; the nearest approach is probably James Woods' splendidly over-the-top contribution as the villainous Ned. As in Anaconda Llosa manages to achieve the feat of damaging the reputation of a once-distinguished but now ageing actor. In Anaconda he was to perform this service for Jon Voight; here it is Rod Steiger as Leon who is left with that look of why on earth did I ever sign up for this? The Specialist can therefore be regarded as a valiant attempt to make a Bad Movie, but the sublime heights of So Bad It's Funny were, as yet, beyond its director's grasp. All he ended up with was a rather dull, derivative and uninteresting action-thriller. My main objection to it was the glorification of the character of Ray Quick who, despite an attempt to give him some sort of ethical code, is no more than a hired killer. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Dreary vanity project action film","Date":"13 March 2007","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Dreary action vehicle for Sylvester Stallone is a bone-crushing bore. Here he portrays...oh, who cares? It is basically the same riff he had done in the majority of his films. A dour Sharon Stone is on-hand as an enigmatic woman who coerces bomb expert Stallone into assassinating the Mafia clan that killed her family. Rod Steiger offers yet another horrible example of overacting as the head of the gangster family. In a ludicrous move, Eric Roberts portrays the assassin responsible for killing Stone's family when she was a little girl. Now an adult, she is playing up to him for revenge. Of course, there is only a two-year age difference between the actors and the film seems to be trying to convince us that there is a huge age difference. The opening scenes are basically a series of phone calls between the leads. You know the film is in trouble when Stallone's lasagna lips render a good portion of the crummy dialog unintelligible and Stone responds by remarking how much she likes his voice. Stallone purportedly campaigned to cast Stone as the lead, but someone forgot to write her a role. She spends the majority of the film as eye candy, cowering or being pulled around, pretty much like a traditional action heroine. There is nothing for her to sink her teeth into. There is a steamy shower scene near the midway point which deftly showcases the daunting physiques of the stars, but other than that there is literally nothing else to recommend the film in the slightest. Oh yeah, James Woods is also in the film, but charitable audiences may do him a favor and forget he was even in it.

It occurred to me then that obviously a clown like any other actor although expert at acting the fool, is usually not himself a fool. John Wayne had a great reputation as a political reactionary, yet probably most of his living admirers are ex-hippies who are politically liberal. He had a way of making the audience believe that it wasn't safe to be as tough and mean as the characters he portrayed. Maybe that's the effect he was cleverly trying to achieve.Using the same theory, it might be reasonable to guess that Sylvester Stallone is not to be confused with the characters Rocky or Rambo or the Specialist; however he seems to be the exception to the rule. In his case I believe the opposite theory is in use he desperately wants to be confused with the characters he portrays because he has a political point he wants to make. The Rocky films are an ideological tract they represent the frustrated desire of bigoted Americans to dominate black and Soviet athletes. The Rambo films are a brief on the frustrated desire of right wingers to destroy the communist enemy. The films are very manipulatively made, technically designed to force the viewer to identify with their heroes. It would be reasonable to assume that the star, who has been creatively involved in production of many of his films all the way from the planning stage, is a propagandist for reactionary right wing causes. In terms of political action he recommends violence to the audience as his solution to the world's problems.The Specialist is particularly troublesome because of the means the ex-CIA agent employs to wreak revenge on his criminal foils. As a demolitions expert, he uses a home made bomb to get rid of the bad guys. This bomb explodes in a public place where any innocent civilian might easily pass by and be killed. Regardless of who the target was supposed to be, I was astonished that an ex-CIA agent, shown to be a good guy hero, could be depicted committing such an act of terrorism inside the United States. Doesn't Stallone know that there are innocent bystanders almost everywhere in populated areas? I'm sure he does, but apparently he felt the end justified the means. Radical Muslim terrorists think the same way and are usually condemned by our government specifically for the means they employ. Since Stallone has a reputation for being a thinker as a film maker, it would be interesting to hear his opinion of worldwide terrorism. Does he disapprove of the tactics of terrorists? How would it be if government authorities, including law enforcement officials, used terrorist bombs every time they wanted to get rid of a bad guy? Is it okay to wipe out civilians in a revenge attack as long as the bad guys get wiped out at the same time? As a film, The Specialist says that terrorist tactics are okay even at the risk of innocent lives.

That's fine but all of the reasons that she wants everyone else dead are brought up and summarily forgotten and by the end all of the bad guys are dead so we figure it's not worth asking anyway.Since no one in Hollywood in confident that a woman could carry a picture like this on her own we get Sylvester Stallone as a former member of the bomb squad. (It's my theory that he is also on hand to insure movie patrons that they will get to see Stone in various stages of undress).  Storywise, he is brought into the fold because his old partner (James Woods) has switched sides and is now working for the Miami drug syndicate.  If that isn't enough, you have a cold hearted vicious thug in the mix and this one is played in an embarrassing role by Rod Steiger who looks like Fred Mertz and talks like he's doing a bad impression of Ricky Ricardo.

Ray refuses to be associated with Trent any longer, and turns him in. Ray is presently an outsider, living in Miami Florida, doing odd jobs here and there. May Munro has secretive phone calls with Ray about bombing the Leons, Tomas & Joe. May witnessed the Leons kill her parents as a child from the closet of her room. Ray initially declines the offer, but his outlook changes when Ned Trent is working with the Leons. Ostensibly, the script for The Specalist was passed around a bit. Steven Seagal was offered the lead role, but turned it down when they wouldn't pay him 9 million. Stallone refused the lead part as well at first, but was goaded into it after a while. I'm glad Seagal turned the part down. He didn't fit the description for Ray Quick. In all honesty? Stallone should have gone with his first instinct, and said no to this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Sylvester Stallone, but i'd be lying if I said he hasn't made some forgettable stinkers in his career. After a suspenseful opening with Stallone & James Woods at their absolute best, this goes down the toilet rather quickly. For starters, it's WAY too talky. Instead of infusing it with action like they should have, they fill it with plenty of uninteresting dialog. The only action we get are some dull explosions, and an amusing action sequence that involves Sly, kicking some ass on a bus to defend an old woman's honor. There is also plenty of steamy flirting with Stallone & Stone on the phone if that interests you, as well as some awkward love-making. Sylvester Stallone can peel a potato for three hours, and I would still be entertained. He sleepwalks through a lot of this film, and looks rather indifferent. There are a few scenes where we get the patented Stallone charisma, but he just looked bored. It is hard to take his character seriously when he has a cat named Timer (!) It wasn't a bad performance by any means, just rather ordinary for him. Sharon Stone gives the best performance in the film (Not by much) with her sexy showcase. I thought she elevated this film with her presence alone. James Woods gives it 100%, and I have to commend him for it. Not many people go nuts like Woods does. I love the guy. Eric Roberts is decent for the most part. He had some good intensity, but his part felt phony. Rod Steiger embarrasses himself with his hammy performance. He annoyed the crap out of me with that accent as well.Final Thoughts Despite some twists and turns, the competent acting, and the potential it has, this movie isn't very good.

The Specialist is an action movie but it has a more developed plot than do most action movies. I was a little concerned when the rating 'Hard Sex' was displayed because personally sex scenes are quite boring -- there is little plot or character development in a sex scene, and even though people might say that one can tell a lot about somebody by the way they have sex, that is generally something that I do not associate with character development (and most Hollywood sex scenes seemed to be identical, with only the participants changing). I feel that most movies could dump their sex scenes and still have a well developed plot. Anyway, there wasn't much in the way of sex scenes in this movie and when it did pop up, I just ignored it.The Specialist is about a man named Ray Quick (Sylvester Stallone) who is an expert with explosives. He used to work for a government agency blowing up people that were considered a threat to the nation. He worked with a man named Ned and after a dispute, they parted company.When we first come into the movie, Ray Quick has retired but a woman named May Munro (Sharon Stone) needs his help to avenge the murder of her parents. There are a lot of twists and we really never know if May is trustworthy. She leaves a note for Ray saying I'm not a woman you can trust. One thing we never know is why her parents were killed by the Mafia. They were either undercover FBI agents or they could have upset the Mafia by embezzling money.Ray Quick is a character that should be looked at. He is more of a stereotype than one would expect. He is the tough highly trained killer who refuses to kill innocent people. This is a flaw, though it is not tragic. Ned's uncaring attitude towards innocent people was his tragic flaw, but he was the bad guy and thus, as is supposed to happen to most bad guys in Hollywood, dies. It is not his tragic flaw that kills him but rather him prancing about bragging about how great he is. The interesting thing about Ray Quick is that I don't think he knows how to drive. I cannot recall him at any time during the movie being in a car, he always catches public transport and at the end he is in the passenger's seat rather than the driver's. This actually makes an interesting change to the stereotype.This is a typical action movie with a reasonable story. The characters are stereotypical and Hollywood clich√©s dominate. There is only one change that happens with the main character and that is that he no longer becomes a loner. There is nothing in the way of in-depth challenging themes but rather it is an enjoyable but brainless movie to watch when one is bored.

Some twenty years ago I was amazed to see a photo of Sylvester Stallone, a fully grown man, solemnly pulling the same stunt in some publication like People Magazine.  The Specialist is an expanded version of that photo of Stallone's already expanded biceps.  I can't think of many other movies in which we see more of the hero's nude and preposterously overblown bronzed body than we do of the heroine's.  (Too bad, Sharon Stone hasn't much more than that to offer.)  Stallone just can't seem to keep his clothes on.  He's always taking showers, walking around with towels around his waist, doing exercises, lying back on a bed with some kind of purple kimono coyly draped over his groin while Stone kneels worshipfully at his feet and runs her hands up his oh-so-muscular legs.  I wonder if Stone was jealous of all Stallone's nude scenes.  The plot?  Oh, the plot.  Well -- you've got me there.  You see, Stone wants to knock off these bad guys who killed her parents.

This does at least make for a refreshing characterisation, whereby the supposedly butchest character is actually the campest. Woods has the sort of on-the-edge, loose cannon character that seems written for an actor of Gary Oldman's ability. Unfortunately it's given to Woods, an actor who has, despite over fifty films to his name, never appeared in a decent movie. Okay, I'll give Casino a pass.In the midst of all this is Rod Steiger (or, as I liked to know him, King Thesp) wasting himself on a stereotyped Mafiosi-type role. Steiger later played opposite Arnie in End of Days and was shrunk by aliens in Tim Burton's unfunny B-Movie homage Mars Attacks! How distressing that such a first-class actor should have been forced to live out the end of his career in fourth-rate bit parts. As he said in this film A man's gotta eat, right? It's full of irrelevant scenes which help to build up the moronic machismo of Sly's &#133; er&#133; character. After standing up on a bus for a pregnant lady, Sly finds a gang member has stolen the seat and is refusing to give it up. Does he ignore the situation like most other people would? No. Reason with the guy maybe? No. He throws him to the ground, boots him in the stomach, beats up his two friends and throws him through a window. He even follows it up with a glib I believe there's a vacant seat. Of course, in real life, the bus would have ground to a halt while the driver accessed the damage and refused to drive on, quoting union regulations, and the pregnant woman would have screamed at him for excessive behaviour. Instead, the scene cuts away as we get to more testosterone-packed japery. But it's also the hypocritical morality that annoys. I hate knives winces Stallone after being threatened by one. So knives and stealing bus seats are bad. Throwing a man through a glass window is perfectly acceptable? You might think I'm reading too much into what is just a brief scene, yet it's scenes like this that regularly punctuated vacuous action movies and went unchecked. For Stallone's Ray Quick, it's not an eye for an eye, it's your entire head, arms and body for a papercut.A later scene has James Woods gain the respect of some underling cops by threatening to blow them up with Semtex. Woods, a deadly rival of Stallone's, just happens to work for the same man who Sharon Stone has hired him to kill. It's a tale of much contrivance but little consequence, on which every one-note motivation is played out before the camera, allowing for no suspense or intrigue. But let's cut to the chase There's only one reason why people really watch this film, and that's to see Sharon Stone naked in the shower. Seeing pneumatic parodies of the human form with star egos hopelessly out of control isn't pleasant. And in what film doesn't Stone take her clothes off anyway? In the middle of all the male egos Stone is very much odd woman out. While her role is supposedly that of empowered female, she needs a man to help her do her work and is there as a physical victim to show their power. Any other function is merely that of receptacle to sexual desires, Stone doing that sexy voice of hers which is as sexy as a sack of kippers. Even searching her for weapons in a church can be a masturbation analogy. Violence against women was commonplace in 90s action movies (as True Lies attests) and seeing Stone cruelly striking another woman is far from pleasant.I'm fairly sure I had a closing line planned for this review, but unfortunately my boredom made me forget what it was...

One-at-a-time, please....For a long time, I've been wondering why actors/actresses think whispering their lines is sexy, or demonstrating they know how to emote. Stallone should have pitched his voice at a higher tone, and stopped trying to get all those weird mouth-movements onto film.On the other hand, James Woods (Ned Trent) needed a muzzle for his hollering - or someone in the sound-booth to turn-down the volume.

Things become complicated when Ray's old CIA buddy turned baddie Ned Trent (James Woods) show's up wanting to kill Ray because he hurt Ned's feelings back in 1984 & that's it basically.This Peruvian American co-production was directed by Luis Llosa which is a name I instantly recognised as this is the guy responsible for one of the worst big budget horror flicks of the 90's, namely Anaconda (1997) which is a film I hate with a passion & guess what? I also hate The Specialist as well, luckily after both this & Anaconda tanked at the box-office & were critically torn to pieces Llosa hasn't been allowed to make an American film since, there is a god after all... Anyway, the script by Alexandra Seros which takes itself far too seriously was 'suggested' by the Specialist novels by John Shirley & is terrible, for a start there's barely any action in it & the scene set on the bus where Stallone beats up some thugs is so pointless & utterly irrelevant to the plot it sticks out like a sore thumb & smacks of a re-shoot in an attempt to up the action quota. In fact all The Specialist offers in terms of action are a couple of exploding vehicles & some large explosions at the end otherwise this is one of the least action packed big budget Stallone flicks I've ever seen. The character's are awful, the dialogue is awful, the story is utterly predictable & pedestrian with virtually no reason given why Ned wants to kill Ray at this point or no reason why May's parents were originally murdered & at nearly two hours long it's a real chore to sit through. I really, really dislike The Specialist & would call it more of a thriller than an action flick although I'm betting the trailer makes it look like it's full of explosions & action scenes but just don't be fooled because it isn't.Director Llosa is an awful director & it's no surprise no respectable studio has let him go anywhere near a film camera since this & Anaconda, there are so many scenes in The Specialist which are played straight & meant to generate tension & excitement but are so poorly & ineptly handled they come across as laughable. The opening scene where trained assassin Stallone suddenly develops a conscience is stupid, the scene in the police station where James Woods threatens an entire room of cops with a homemade bomb is ridiculous as the cops would have shot his head off, the sex scene between Stallone & Stone is one of the most unerotic & frankly ugly pieces of film I've ever seen & James Woods losing it in front of all those cops & telling them all to shut up is just hilarious & his character comes across like some sort of clown rather than the hard as nails bad guy he should have. Apart from when Stallone beats some punks up on a bus there's no fights, there's no shooting, there's no car chases & the only explosions worth mentioning are right at the very end if you can make it that far.With a supposed budget of about $45,000,000 The Specialist was a well funded film although I struggled to see where the money went although Stallone was paid $15,000,000 to be in it so I guess there's my answer. Apparently Steven Seagal only wanted $9,000,000 to star & direct so why didn't Warner Bros. go with him? Well they didn't want to pay him that much so they went to Stallone who only wanted an extra $6,000,000 anyway... To be honest this feels like a low budget straight to video Seagal flick, it really does. The acting is terrible from all involved, Stallone is even more wooden than usual, Stone is just plain awful & not particularly good looking in this while the usually superb James Woods is left trying to make the best of a terrible script & a rubbish character but even he ends up looking somewhat embarrassed.The Specialist is a terrible film which I hated when I saw it back in the 90's & still hate now when I saw it but a few hours ago, there's nothing much more I can say other than I personally think it's complete rubbish except some decent explosions at the end which aren't worth waiting for.

And yes, when i say that i also count Rocky I, Rambo I and Cop Land. The difference there was that he actually played the role of someone who was more or less beaten into a retarded state which fit his personality and screen presence more or less perfect. Anyway, i'm never expecting much from Mr. Stallone but this movie is still a little crap-smelling gem among his work.I don't know why i enjoy movies that are awful, i always have. At least to a certain extent. And this movie is certainly awful. The action scenes are crap, the attempts at a thriller are soon smashed by Stallones complete lack of talent and everything more or less completely collapses before the end. There is really only one redeeming factor here and that is James Woods. You can say a lot of things about him but he's usually good, even when everything else stinks. I don't know if good is the word for his performance here, entertaining is probably more like it.So what sucks about the movie? More or less everything. The story is pathetic, Sharon Stone is weak, Stallone is awful, the effects are lame... Need i go on? Yes i do. This movie also contains the least erotic sex-scene in movie history. Sylvester Stallone stands eyeballing his own muscles and doing ridiculous poses while a naked Sharon Stone in vain tries to get his attention. When she finally does, sane people have already tuned out.Why does a crappy movie always seem even more crappy when it looks expensive? I don't know, and neither do you probably. Well, there is something to think about while avoiding this stinker. I rate it 2/10 and that leaves the score at.. James Woods 2 - Rest of movie 0.

Loads of big explosions and fight scenes. Not much interest. I prefer Stallone as Rocky.Arnold's still the best action star out there. "}]
