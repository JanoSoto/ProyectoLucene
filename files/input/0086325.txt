This 2nd sequel to the original (and quite good) Smokey and the Bandit stinks everywhere. The story is lame and the characters have been reduced to caricatures of themselves.Let's start with the story. The premise here is that those Enos boys are at it again, wanting to have some fun at the expense of someone. That someone is none other than Sheriff Buford T. Justice (key the tuba) who has just put in for retirement. When those retirement plans aren't what he expected, our valiant Sheriff accepts the Enos' challenge Deliver a plastic shark to the new restaurant the Enos boys opened up. While along the way, those rascally Enos dudes are going to try to stop him at any cost.Okay, stop right there. In the first Bandit movie, the idea was a simple challenge and bet. The Enos boys were depicted as nothing more than a rich father and son team who were bored so they thought up a good challenge. No real maliciousness involved - just a challenge with some money put up to make people take it seriously. That was fun.In the 2nd Bandit movie, the Enos reputation (such as it is) is on the line and they want to beat a political rival. Not as strong, but again, nothing terribly malicious involved. This movie has them just trying to be mean to their new play toy. Namely, Sheriff Justice. So they send him on his way and start trying to sabotage his trip. When Justice beats them at every turn, they figure that they need a professional to deal with him. Since the Bandit isn't around (he's off making Stroker Ace) they give the job (and the red shirt, belt buckle and hat) to Cledus, our old truck driving buddy.So, Cledus chases Justice to get the prized shark and fun and laughter ensue. Well, not too much fun and little laughter but look on the bright side - it was a paycheck for Gleason and Reed. Anyway, from there on out it becomes the now tired old cat-and-mouse game with one side giving chase to the other. But even the chases lack the polish to make you remember back to the ones in the 1977 original. They seem more staged and one dimensional. For example, there's a scene where Cledus and a new buddy sneak up from behind and take the shark off of the Sheriff's car. The shot is not technically difficult and it's rather boring. Plus, what law enforcement officer doesn't check his mirror to make sure of what's behind him? I learned that in 11th grade driver's ed.Anway, to summarize, I think the use of the 1982 (anemic) Trans Am is allegorical to this movie It's got the right name but is under-thought, underpowered and basically is just a diluted version of its former self.

I just get a kick out of seeing what a couple of million dollars really means to Hollywood.  In this case, it doesn't mean much.  Smokey 3 is one of the biggest stinkers ever produced by a major studio. Besides asking the obvious questions that this movie poses (Why would The Great One actually star in this disaster and how could Universal create, release, and advertise this movie and still be able to sleep at night?), you have got to wonder one thing...where in the heck did all of these ramps come from?  One example (out of too many to count) is how Jerry Reed (Snowman posing as Bandit) actually jumps his Firebird out of his garage...from a dead stop...huh?? The plot is putrid, the supporting cast is horrible (Jerry Reed used to be lovably annoying as Snowman...all he can do here is utter obnoxious one-liners and triple-speak while hooting and hollering about getting to pretend to be Burt Reynolds), and there is actually a point during all this mess when the pity for Gleason lifts, and you actually want something to fall from the sky onto Buford T. Justice and end it all. But watch this movie...I beg you...this is the worst bad movie ever made, and it is worth the rental money to spend 1 and 1/2 hours being embarrassed for the families and friends of everyone who had a hand in this disaster.

Really, a second Bandit movie was too much, but at least the sequel had the entire cast back and was funny at times. Neither can be said about this film.Like with most bad movies, the whole central thesis of this film is wrong. Here, the crime is screwing around with story continuity. Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) is entertaining as a foil for the Bandit, but making him the main character is just insane.The plot to this little travesty is that Justice and his simpleminded son Junior (Mike Henry) must transport a plastic shark cross country that's going to be the mascot for Big and Little Enis Burdett's new fast food franchise in exchange for $250,000. However, the Enises intend to make his life miserable by impeding his progress at every turn, and even enlist the help of Cletus The Snowman Snow (Jerry Reed) to impersonate the Bandit and try to steal the fish away.Along the way, Justice acquires a big, ugly female admirer, gets involved in motor hijinks, and tries to steal back the fish from Cletus and Dusty Trails (Colleen Camp), a former used car salesman who hooks up with the faux Bandit for no discernible reason other than it's in the script.All right, at this point you're going WTF? and rightly so. This whole film is a mess. How can a movie filled with stunts and action scenes be so boring? Very, very easily. Just put together filmmakers with no talent or vision, give them a script that's hackneyed at best, and let 'er rip!The movie is filled with stupid and pointless scenes. A long sequence feature Ku Klux Klan members attacking two black truck drivers is tasteless and poorly realized, and is indicative of the movie's general theme -- crude sequences thrown together with little rhyme or reason.The only part of the movie that made me laugh was a brief sequence where Buford and Junior Justice are in a hotel room filled with sexual deviants, and each time they open door Buford comments on the situation. Looks like a union meeting, he mentions, followed by Get away from that or you'll get the herpes! which are both just as stupid as anything else in this movie. An opening sequence spoofing Patton made me crack a smile, but that was all.Reed is simply awful in the role of the Bandit, and plays the role like a third grader who got the part of a lifetime and can't stop gleaming. Maybe someone should have told him that being proxy to a legend isn't a compliment.And of course, the big question is WHERE IS BURT REYNOLDS? The answer? AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! Heck, compared to this, Cannonball Run 2 is a masterpiece. And yes, it did hurt to say that.Gleason should have known better, but still, any moment he's on screen is a welcome relief in this turkey. His Southern-baked comments are old hat but this time, but at least they remind of you of a time when his character was actually entertaining. And he sure beats the endless amount of screen time eaten up by Paul Williams and Pat McCormick extra corny dialogue as the Enises. They're just bad. Really bad.In the only inspired moment of the movie, Reynolds shows up in a brief cameo dream sequence near the end, almost like a bone being tossed to the audiences who stuck it out through the whole film. The scene isn't funny, but it shows that there is some sort of epic relationship between Smokey and the Bandit. The sequence belonged in a better movie, but sadly, that will never happen now.What else? Oh yeah, what can you say about a race movie so bad that even Hal Needham won't direct it? His replacement, Dick Lowry, seems to have no particular talent of his own, and justly returned to directing television shortly after. Screenwriters Stuart Birnbaum and David Dashev worked on one more movie together, the 1987 comedy Summer School which is actually pretty good, but never wrote another script. I suppose it's best to bow out with something good on your resume.One final note -- there is apparently a whole different version of this film where Gleason plays both Justice and the Bandit that test audiences were not very fond of. Reed was added for new footage to fill the gaps, which explains why he doesn't even show up until half an hour into the movie. I doubt the first version could have been worse than the finished product.The first Smokey and the Bandit was at least a fun experience. This is just a third rate rip-off, even going so far as to shamelessly steal scenes from the first movie, only redoing them in horrible fashion. This whole movie is a lifeless, by-the-numbers effort, and completely devoid of any true redeeming qualities. Unless you really enjoyed the first two movies and have some sort of sick curiosity, I suggest you avoid this abortion of a movie at all costs.Two out of ten stars. A sad waste of Gleason's talent in the final years of his life, and now thankfully a largely forgotten motion picture.

Im Sorry but every film (Colleen Camp) has been in she plays the same obnoxious, in your face, character resembling a caffeine addict, or suffering some sort of withdrawal symptoms in the attitude and whinny voice she has in her acting desperately in need of a fix.One stunt woman turned actress named (Faith Minton) is a remember able looking sort, tall, leggy, and a face to match any fantasy, plays the dragon lady who is smitten by the Sheriff who forces her way into hitching a ride with the Sheriff....i don't know why the sheriff is running away from her as she is more of an eye full better than bandits colleen camp seat cover.Watch this movie if you are a fan of Jackie Gleeson....or Faith Minton remember this film was shot in the years where CB Radios where dying out and truckers fighting cops were all said and done, even BJ and The Bear was axed 3 years before, The dukes of Hazzard and The A-Team were on the rise so i guess Universal wanted In on the Zany Madcap Sheriff Car Crashing Icon that was a big hit in the early 1970's But this was 1983, and it just didn't stick with other films out that year like Ghostbusters Gremlins Two Of A Kind and Twilight Zone The Movie and another Universal comeback Jaws 3 they must have fired a scriptwriter that year....or Hal Needham wasn't available.

It was completely ridiculous and could have been completely taken out of the movie, and you wouldn't have missed a thing.

Justice's (Jackie Gleason) chances of transporting a plastic shark from Miami to the Enos Ranch. If the sheriff loses that bet with the Enos, he will give up his badge. If he wins, the gets $250,000.Like the first two movies, there is virtually no basic plot to this sequel, taking on the same formula of the high-speed car chase with Justice Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) in pursuit of The Bandit. Gleason continued his hilarious portrayal of the Sheriff, inserting laugh-out-loud redneck humor where appropriate and continues to talk-down his slow-thinking son, Junior (Mike Henry). As I used to watch the movie when I was a little kid, I had fond memories from it and especially enjoyed watching all the car cases, car flips and the the sheriff's police vehicle getting a pounding after each collision. And of course, the shark gets an honorable mention.Jerry Reed, I thought, tried too hard to mimic Burt Reynold's Bandit role and cannot really pull off a good acting job in this movie. He acted more like a clown in my opinion. And, Colleen Camp was underused in the story and didn't contribute much - she just went along for the ride and tried to fill in Sally Ride's shoes from the first two films. But, Camp wasn't bad in the role overall considering what little she had to work with and she is a sight for sore eyes.This sequel has its funny moments, mostly courtesy of Jackie Gleason. The cop vs. bandit action was lesser in this movie and the sexual gags were a little too much. Again, some nice car chases scenes, but it's apparent the series has lost steam.Grade C "},{"Title":"Smokey and the Bandit Part 3","Date":"11 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Why is this sequel called 'Part 3'? beats me, sounds strange really, like an old fashioned tale. Other than that its business as usual for a third time accept for the fact that the Bandit is no longer with us on this road trip. Yep for this third movie Reynolds has flown the coop leaving Gleason to hold the fort on his lonesome. The only other returning cast member is Reed as the old Snowman.The plot once again sees the ultra rich Enos duo offering a wager to (this time) Sheriff Buford T. Justice. The rather pointless aim this time is to transport a large stuffed fish on their car, from Florida to Texas, within the time limit. Why a stuffed fish? well it makes no difference really, its just a stupid visual gag. So Justice accepts the wager and drives off with his dim witted son played again by Mike Henry. The little twist or gimmick in this story is after the Enos duo fail to slow down Buford on his new quest, they attempt to hire the Bandit to help them. But as we know Reynolds isn't in this movie so instead they have to opt for the Snowman for assistance.This entire idea is somewhat tired really it must be said. The original movie was a great slice of hokey, Dixie bound tomfoolery with a cool car. The second was an utter shameless rehash of the first which literately didn't even bother to try and be remotely different, accept for the cargo it was virtually identical. Now with this they have turned the tables and tried a new angle by making Buford the mule, which I must give small kudos too. Alas they still can't escape the lure of the original flicks plot and simply have to make the movie into another big chase sequence. Unfortunately that small element of originality with Buford goes out the window, the reason being the Snowman manages to slow Buford down by stealing the large stuffed fish on his car. Buford needs this stuffed fish to win the wager. Thusly this once again sees Buford on the chase, after the Snowman and the large stuffed fish. The twist concept of Buford being chased doesn't last long I'm afraid. Heck even Cledus the Snowman manages to pick up a female sidekick in virtually the same fashion as the Bandit did way back in the first movie. It appears that these movie characters have requirements, Buford always chases and the protagonist always has a female sidekick...and drives a Trans Am.I don't actually know what Buford is in his police attire for this really, he is on the brink of retirement and once again is completely out of his jurisdiction the whole time. I understand being a police officer in a police car would have its advantages in high speed chases but he's out of his jurisdiction! In America you can tell that easily from the car model, colour, body wrap layout and of course the badge on the side. It doesn't matter of course because we all know its just for the movie, Buford has to be in his police garb, with his son, driving a wrecked police car, otherwise its not Buford T. justice.I think we all know what to expect with this movie by now. There isn't much time to blink without possibly missing something as the entire movie is literately one big chase and crash sequence after another. There is very little actual plot or character building going in between the chaos. We see one chase and crash, Buford suffering some kind of humiliation and his car getting more beat up as it goes, then move on the next chase and crash. The slapstick and pratfalls are on a grand scale with this one, perhaps even more so than before, where as the stunts are pretty predictable really, you can see what's gonna happen the second the scene starts. They even throw in some motorboat chases this time, just to mix it up a bit...a tiny bit.On the whole its more like watching banger/stock car racing on the streets, the mayhem is through the roof with gravity defying, unrealistic nonsense that is impressive in an odd way (gotta admire the stunt work). Its not really funny though, more childish and insane than anything, kids might like it but geez...even 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'Knight Rider' are more realistic. Put simply, it kinda works better than the second movie because they try something different, but it still doesn't work entirely because there is no Reynolds as the Bandit and Reed is no leading man. The Snowman on his own just doesn't hit the mark even if he is driving the famous black Trans Am Firebird.Definitely only for people who like these specific late 70's/80's madcap car chase genre movies. If you like to spot all the old cars, pickup trucks and big rigs, whilst seeing a good old crunch up with solid stunts etc...well you know already this is the movie for you. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Luckily this was the last","Date":"26 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" 'Smokey and the Bandit.' In case you didn't know (and who the hell starts watching a film series on 'Part III?') was about a car racer, aka 'Bandit' helping his tracker mate 'Snowman' to get their load across America, while constantly being pursued by a relentless policeman, 'Smokey.' Therefore, you'd expect part III would be along those lines. The film's only just over an hour and twenty minutes and for the first half an hour, we don't see the 'Bandit.' That part of the film should just be called 'Smokey and the.' Then the Bandit enters. Only he doesn't. Burt Reynolds didn't come back to play the titular role for the third instalment. Instead, the trucker 'Snowman' takes on his role of car driver.Does he pull it off? Not really. He tries, but it's pretty hard to watch. First of all he's not &#x96; and never will be &#x96; Burt Reynolds. He can't really bring anything new to the role. Secondly, in terms of character development, the character of Snowman completely changes from what we've gotten used to from the first two outings. For a moment I even thought it was a different actor playing him! Then Snowman (or maybe 'Bandit' now?) gets a girl/partner to drag along. It seems totally forced, simply copying the same plot device used in the first film.However, worst of all, is that there's nothing new here to see. Seriously, you should try this, if you're watching Part III on DVD, just skip a couple of chapters for the hell of it. You won't miss anything and you'll completely be able to work out what's happened. Basically, in DVD terms, every 'chapter' represents a time where Smokey nearly catches Bandit, but he gets away. Each time Smokey's car gets trashed, but somehow still manages to carry on then he moans at his long-suffering son (who he's dragged along for no real reason).If you haven't actually seen the first two and happen to stumble onto this one, I'm not saying you won't smile the odd time. There are moments of fun, but, if I want fun, thrills, good characters (played by the right actors!) and originality, I'll just watch the first one thank you.

This movie is so bad, I will not even call it a movie. Nor will I give it a rating. Smokey 3 is just 85 minutes of stupid lines, horrible attempts at acting, and the lamest stunts ever put on celluloid. Now allegedly, Jackie Gleason was supposed to somehow play both Sheriff Justice as well as the Bandit. I'm not sure how that finished product would have looked, but it couldn't possibly have been any worse than the final product they came up with here.The story deals with Big and Little Enos (Enis?) challenging the retiring Sheriff Justice to a pretty lame bet. Instead of trucking Coors Beer or a pregnant elephant across the South, he has to drive a PLASTIC SHARK from Florida to Texas as part of a promo for their new fish restaurants or something. I won't waste any more time on the plot. Just trust me... its stupid. You can tell that Jerry Reed was a fill in after the initial dailies were a bust. He doesn't appear for a while, and many of his scenes seem totally arbitrary. Actually the whole 85 are kind of arbitrary. All we see are a series of boring stunts and detours to ridiculous locations. The stunts are about as original as driving an old Pontiac through whatever they could stack up. Ice, eggs, sand, flowers, Cuban refugees... you name it. There are detours to swinger hotels, nudist colonies, construction sites, etc. None of it is interesting. Even the nudity is laughable. Its like watching an old episode of Benny Hill with flabby early-80s nude people frolicking amidst quick editing cuts. The Trans Am was a weak-looking car by then, too. There is also a truly tasteless scene where a truck full of drunken Klansmen harass two black chicken farmers who sound as stereotypical as Amos and Andy.

I think Cletus gives the fish to Sheriff Justice so he can keep his badge and collect $250,000. I hope Gleason was paid a hell of a lot more than that for appearing in this swill. Ughhhh!

But each time the Enos duo seem to throw up roadblocks, Buford and his oft-ridiculed son, Junior (Mike Henry, as amiable and clueless as ever) just seem to keep going. Buford is relentless, even as the Enos duo elicits the assistance of a new Bandit, Cletus (Jerry Reed, still plenty appealing and relishing the chance to be in the driver seat for a change instead of second fiddle to Burt Reynolds), to secure the shark himself, offered the same reward if he can make the trip in a few days time. With a tagalong, Dusty Trails (Colleen Camp; I swear this is the poor girl's character's name in the film!) as his passenger, Cletus will further complicate matters for poor Buford, stealing away the shark (he uses a lasso as Dusty takes temporary control of the steering wheel!), and forcing the sheriff to play a game of take the shark throughout their journey cross country.This film seems designed specifically to destroy Gleason's cop car (and, man alive, does that car take a beating!) as it explodes through a milk hauler (that showers the Enos duo who planned to use the truck as a diversionary tactic), takes out the Klu Klux clan (who had been tormenting a black chicken farmer and his father (but the chicken farmers get the last laugh when the Clan is tarred and feathered!), smashes through a flower stand and cartons of eggs, not to mention, a bumper is torn off from a tow truck, the tires are flattened, and the Enos duo drop bombs at the end leaving it a skeletal wreck. Gleason and Reed try really hard to make the comedy work, and that saddens me to no end because the film just does them no favors. The script leaves Gleason trying to make flea pecker and you dumb sht zingers tickle our funnybone, and after a while I could only feel sorry for him. It isn't for a lack of effort, though. Reed has this one scene where he must go into a bar with Harley bikers hanging around and fall out over and over while asking Camp what all she wants on her cheeseburger, repeatedly returning to eventually vanquish the baddies giving him a hard time&#x85;it feels like a daunting task for poor Jerry, having to get laughs out of spilling from a bar, all smiles and flashing the ah, gee, whiz attitude despite punches to the face nearly damaging his shades. Camp is given little to work with, trying (bless her heart) to use her bright personality to overcome uninspired dialogue that is more or less chatty back and forth with Reed. I did like Reed allowing Buford the chance to win at the end; it was very un-Bandit like. The Burt Reynolds cameo still feels as forced as I remembered from childhood. Gleason and Henry got some giggles out of me, and I love Reed even if his role is overwhelmingly reduced in relation to Gleason's. Right from the song sung during the credits sequence, this film was designed around the Buford T Justice character; even the poster for this film has Gleason's face at the forefront. As the film goes, everything from a sex hotel orgy to a colony of nudists is hurled at us, with Gleason reacting exhaustingly, What has this world come to?!?! Don't worry, you get to see the Trans Am drive right through an inferno with Gleason following suit, the two cars joining a race, and a dirt hauler dumps a load on poor Gleason's car, helping the Bandit get a little distance from the persistent sheriff. I think the absence of the star power of Reynolds and Sally Field can be felt, but even the previous sequel with them in it proved that the first film probably should have remained standalone. There are times where a film feels like a desperate attempt to keep a dead franchise resuscitated, and this is such an example...also an example of fun actors unable to overcome the odds compounding them. At least you get to see Gleason standing in front of a giant American Flag, dressed as George C Scott's Patton, boring the audience of his law enforcement peers while praising his career and announcing his retirement...

Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice, is at his best in this one. Him and his son Junior (Mike Henry), have many funny segments. One prime example is the part where they run out of gas, and they argue about who is going to push the car. Another one is where Sheriff Justice is in the traffic jam, and takes a shortcut into oncoming traffic. We see a cameo of Joe Pesci, which has a really funny laugh in it. Burt Reynolds has a cameo appearance in the end, which is really detailed, considering it being a cameo appearance.There are many spectacular stunts and chase scenes I liked as well. Such as the part where Sheriff Justice goes through the cannon at the race track. Then later you see the back of the car all charred up from the cannon, which is really funny. Another great scene is by Cledus The Snowman (Jerry Reed), where he is getting revenge from the first Smokey and the Bandit and brawling it out with the motorcycle guys. Unlike the first one, he wins this time, while he's getting a burger for one of my favorite actresses Colleen Camp, who plays Dusty Trails.Dusty Trails (Colleen Camp) doesn't appear until exactly one-third of the way through the movie. My favorite part with her is where she's wearing the cowgirl outfit. I also like the few lines she has with Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Needless to say, she's the main reason I like this movie. She's great throughout the movie.I also enjoyed watching Big and Little Enos, as they get more screen time. One really spectacular part is where they shoot the dart to blow out Sheriff Justice's tire, plenty of action there! Then Sheriff Justice loses one more tire after leaning on the front of the car, which makes it even more funny and exciting!Finally, this movie just gave some of the other people a chance to be in the spotlight, which I like to see as well. The bet Big and Little Enos make for Sheriff Justice to haul the shark clear across the southern United States, Colleen Camp hitching a ride with Jerry Reed, plenty of comedy and one-liners from Jackie Gleason, explosive action and breathtaking stunts, it just all comes together to make a quality adventure. The ending is quite inspirational, as it shows the Bandit and Sheriff Justice at the chase once again, preserving their reputation.

I've seen it probably a dozen times and, No, it doesn't come close to matching the first one but it does beat part 2 by a mile.  Part 2 was a very odd sequel.  It's very weird when a movie comes out claiming to be a sequel and none of the characters act the same.  The Bandit was just an all-out jerk in that one and it's a wonder the writers ever got a paycheck.  I would have sued. Bandit 3 should have been an apology for the second and while it wasn't exactly that, it sure was a lot of fun.  It's certainly got it's share of faults.  The whole thing feels very slap dash, kinda like Director Dick Lowry was in a hell of a hurry to get it made and released as quickly as the characters were trying to transport the plastic shark.  For some reason or another, Junior has gotten even dumber and the Snowman has been on a major diet (think anorexia) and has also discovered hair dye.  If you liked Snowman in the first two, well this is your movie.  He takes over the wheel in the TA this time and he even dresses like the Bandit. As many people know, Jackie Gleason was supposed to be playing both, Smokey and the Bandit (what the hell?) and the original cut of this film, was shot just that way (what the HELL were they thinking?!) as Smokey IS the Bandit.  I don't know who was to blame for that enormously stupid idea, but I thank God that the test audiences felt the same way as I do about it.  When everyone failed to see the humor in that, the director went back to work.  He called Jerry Reed to be the Bandit and re shot a bunch of scenes, interweaving them with scenes that he'd already shot.  If anyone's curious about the overabundance of continuity errors, well, there's your answer. What you see here is the finished project.  If things are a bit confusing, now you know why.  Knowing all of this, I still enjoy watching it.  I'm not sure why, but it's just good light-hearted fun.  Maybe with a better director at the helm, it would have done a lot better and wouldn't have such a tarnished reputation.  Still, being as it is, I would still reccommend it.  7/10.

But being a casual fan of the S&tB films, I'd like to offer a different perspective.Smokey and the Bandit III is essentially a string of funny lines and scenes loosely held together by a plot. The storyline is weak, but who cares. This wasn't exactly the Godfather to begin with, so the 3rd installment should be embraced for what it is; A Jackie Gleason vehicle that allows us to revisit characters we've loved since the first film, minus Burt Reynolds' Bandit, of course.The plot centers around Sheriff Bufford T. Justice announcing his retirement from active law enforcement. But the Enos's propose a wager, which Bufford initially turns down. But after a montage of mishaps Bufford finds retirement hell, and takes them up on the bet. The bet? That Bufford has to drive from Miami Florida to the Enos Ranch within a certain amount of time, while carrying a giant fake shark on their car (the Enos Fish & Chips logo). If he wins, he gets $250k. If not, Little Enos gets Bufford's badge. While the Enos's find some success at trying to impede Buffords progress initially, they eventually contact the Snowman (Jerry Reed) to assume the mantle of The Bandit and steal the logo and return it to the ranch himself.What follows is a cat and mouse game as they each give chase, while running into a variety of characters and situations setting up for those simple, country-boy redneck laughs that have been a staple of the franchise thus far. Yes, some old lines do get rehashed, but there's plenty more to keep you engaged.While a funny film, and a pleasure to watch with friends over beer and pretzels, it is a lackluster finale, not only to the Bandit films, but to the short lived Convoy era of movies and television, such as the Cannonball Run and Dukes of Hazzard.Buffords final salute at the end of the film and the song Ticket For The Wind by John Stewart emotionally sum up a tearful goodbye to this era.

Even Gleason's performance seemed forced, and some voice dubs didn't even sound like him. How could Jerry Reed go from so likable and natural in the first two films, to so crazed and annoying in the third? The writing was terrible, Colleen Camp was a complete piece of wood, and the jokes were embarrassing excuses for humor.

Justice announces that he was going to retire but the Enuses want Buford to take the bet and he refuses but since his retirement wasn't going so well, he decides to take the bet by driving the car with the fish (which is the franchise) on the top of the car within 28 hours, hell get $250,000 and if he doesn't his badge is going to be destroyed and the Enuses makes sure that Buford won't make it on time.Later on the Enuses call up Cledus to take the bet and he later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp, and she is awful compared to Sally Field).Overall this movie has its high points and its low points.High Points The scenes with Buford T. Justice and his dumb idiot son Junior, the hotel part, the police chase when a car does a 360 degree angle, Junior at his dumbest and good music.Low Points The Ku Klux Klan part, the Enuses playing mean tricks on Buford, and the ending.Overall this movie is pretty forgettable compared to the first but it's a classic compared to the second due to Burt Reynolds being obnoxious (what happened to the happy go lucky side of him on the first movie).

The bet is for Buford to carry a plastic shark, advertising the Enises new resturant, on the top his police car and deliver it to the Enis ranch in Texas in 14 hours or less. If he makes it, he'll get the $250,000 dollar prize. If he does'nt make it, the Enises will take his badge. One thing Buford does'nt know is that the Enises have hired the Snowman to act as the bandit and compete for the $250,000 prize! The Enises are out there to get in the way of Buford as they to slow him down and ruin his car in many various ways.  The way Buford's car looks like at the end of the movie is classic!
