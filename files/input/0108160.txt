Though I never saw it with a guy, it is definitely a chick flick.  That said, it's a high-end chick flick, which probably a few guys might enjoy, unless they happen to be the exploding helicopter type^^;  This movie feels more like a modern day adaptation of the classic romance An Affair To Remember, and it keeps referencing it too (In fact, the Cary Grant classic is very integral to the plot).  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have great chemistry together, and they both do what they're good at-Tom Hanks portraying the Everyman, and Meg Ryan being cute and innocent.  I have to disagree with an earlier comment that this film is unfair to guys-the way the characters are portrayed, I'd have to say that in the reverse situation, I'd still feel the same way.  Meg Ryan does not have the evil woman syndrome that popped up in later 90's chick flicks (The most notorious of which was My Best Friend's Wedding).  She is very believable and actually does care about the feelings of her fiance.  What I particularly liked is that the fiance was not portrayed as someone who Meg would do well to leave.  Most movies fall into this trap-Someone is about to marry someone who is horrible and find that someone else is better, the viewer supposedly not feeling bad because the fiance was a jerk anyway.  Tom Hanks really shines here as someone who has lost the most important person in his life and is trying to rebuild again.  He always has a knack for easily slipping into the roles he's given and making them really convincing.  He does not fail here-you feel for him especially during the sequences where he starts remembering his late wife.  The movie's plot starts to stretch plausibility at the end, but not to the point where it destroys the entire film.  The ending scene in particular is handled very carefully.  You could have had a big, romantic, tear-jerking moment.  Instead, the movie takes a more simplistic approach, and it succeeds-it feels much more natural than the alternative.  Overall, if you're in for a feel good romance, you should see this.  If you happen to be female, this is DEFINITELY worth watching.

So it's imperative that individuals find that special niche for themselves, that little piece of the world that becomes their own, where they can live and love and engage in the pursuit of happiness.  And once that `perfect' world is created, it's devastating when something upsets the balance, as in the case of this film, the death of a spouse.  When the love of a lifetime is abruptly taken away, how does one recover?  Can one recover?  How do you go on when your heart has been removed?  All valid questions that are explored and addressed in Nora Ephron's touching and romantic `Sleepless In Seattle,' starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  The film begins on a somber note, with the funeral of Maggie Baldwin (Carey Lowell), respectively the wife and mother of Sam Baldwin (Hanks) and his son, Jonah (Ross Malinger).  Maggie was the love of Sam's life, and inconsolable after her passing, he decides the best thing for himself and his son is to move to another city and try for a fresh start.  So they head west as far as possible, to Seattle, where Sam remains unable to emerge from the funk of his loss.   	 	Christmas and New Year's is especially tough on Sam and Jonah, and around this time Jonah happens to tune into a late night talk show featuring Dr. Marcia Fieldstone (Caroline Aaron), whose job is to help her listeners with their problems.  Jonah calls her and tells their story, then takes the phone to his dad in the next room, and in deference to his son, Sam consents to talk about his situation on National radio.  In the Baltimore area, writer Annie Reed (Ryan) is listening, and touched by the sincerity in Sam's voice, she cajoles an assignment that subsequently takes her to Seattle, where she attempts to hook up with Sam, a man she knows only as a needful, disembodied voice from the radio.	So begins a romantic odyssey that probably could only happen in the movies, but it makes no difference because in Ephron's capable hands, this story works, and it works beautifully.  There's a line in the movie, in fact, that kind of sums it all up  Becky (played by Rosie O'Donnell) says something to the effect to Annie that, `You don't want love, you want `movie' love.  And maybe that's why this movie is so endearing and enduring; it's about the kind of love you find in a perfect world, the kind of love everybody wants and needs (though few will admit it, even to themselves) but rarely finds, and Ephron knows exactly how to make it connect with her audience.  It has to do with understanding basic human needs and knowing how to translate it all into a cinematic art form that will effectively reach those who see it.  And Nora Ephron does it as well-- or possibly better-- than any director before or since, and as she proved later with `You've Got Mail,' this film was no fluke; she knows her stuff, and she knows how to deliver it.  It's intentionally and shamelessly sentimental, but rather than maudlin, Ephron hits just the right emotional tone, and it's perfect, from the romance to the humor she injects at just the right moment to offset the drama, to the music-- using just the right song at just the right time-- that does so much to enhance the story.   	Having a great cast, of course, certainly helped her in her endeavor, beginning with Tom Hanks who, with his portrayal of Sam, demonstrates once again what a consummate actor he is.  Few actors can step into any given genre of film and create a character that is so complete and believable every time out the way Hanks can.  Some of his characters may share some traits and have similarities, but he manages to make each one unique, which is quite a feat.  When you can watch Hanks and forget that you're watching `Hanks,' you know he's accomplished something.  As an actor he is remarkably giving, and so undaunted when it comes to using and exposing what he has inside.  And his ability to circumvent any natural inhibitions makes him great at what he does, and it's what makes a character like Sam so memorable.	Meg Ryan, as well, is an accomplished actor who can play drama as well as comedy (check out her performance in `When A Man Loves A Woman'), but she really sparkles in romantic comedies like this one, and she is absolutely perfect for the role of Annie (just as she was for her role in `You've Got Mail').  She makes Annie a very real person, and through her we can empathize with Sam's situation, as she enables and allows the audience to experience what she is feeling right along with her.  Ryan, through her character, makes that emotional involvement possible, and it's one of the strengths of the film.  And like Hanks with Sam, Ryan makes Annie a character you're going to remember.	The exemplary supporting cast includes Bill Pullman (Walter), Rita Wilson (Suzy), Victor Gerber (Greg), Tom Riis Farrell (Rob), David Hyde Pierce (Dennis), Dana Ivey (Claire), Gaby Hoffman (Jessica) and Rob Reiner (Jay).  Essentially a poignant and heart-felt treatise by Nora Ephron on life and love, `Sleepless In Seattle' is a film that offers a multitude of rewards if you are simply willing to reach out and open yourself up to it.  All you have to do is let it in.  Do it, and you'll be glad you did, guaranteed.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.

Should she track down Sam and see...or stay with sweet, dependable, dull, safe Walter? What do you think?The plot is ridiculous but damned if it doesn't work! The film is chock full of sweet, romantic songs and images. It all leads up to an admittedly howler of an ending on top of the Empire State Building--it was so over the top that, while they were shooting it, director Nora Ephron was muttering under her breath Can we get away with this?!

The actors and the sweet, romantic tone of the film really pull you in.Hanks and Ryan were perfectly cast as the leads. They're both very good actors and excellent comedians. Unfortunately, this movie was such a huge hit that Ryan was type cast as a sweet, romantic woman. She's only now getting rid of that image. Pullman is bad in his role but it is NOT his fault. He doesn't have anything to work with--his character isn't even given a last name! He's just there as a plot contrivance. Rosie O'Donnell, however, provides excellent support as Ryans' boss. Also Rob Reiner, Rita Wilson (Hanks' real life wife) and Victor Garber shine in small roles. Also Malinger is very good as Hanks' son. The only thing that bothered me was the constant references to the old Hollywood weepie An Affair to Remember. I HATE that film! If you hate romantic comedies avoid this at all costs.

Sam is sane, tries a normal way to see if he can have a relationship. I like him. But if you cut out all of his scenes Annie just seems kinda nuts. You can't see her relationship falling apart.

The film also has a bit of sadness in its early part, thankfully not overdone. The five lead characters and the performances by their actors (Hanks, Ryan, Malinger, Pullman and O'Donnell) are all engaging. The primary members of the support cast are also excellent (David Pierce, Annie's brother; Garber and Wilson as Sam's brother-in-law and sister; Reiner as his colleague/friend; young Gaby Hoffman; and Barbara Garrick as Sam's brief girlfriend). The story, juxtaposed with the classic Grant/Kerr predecessor, could have provided an excessive gimmick, but here it worked well. And I was grateful for some things I didn't find in this flick. Although I watched the program like everyone else, I found Rob Reiner's character, acting and presence in All in the Family to be obnoxious and annoying, ALL THE TIME, and watched the program in spite of his presence. And I have found Rosie O'Donnell's presence to be the epitomé of ANNOYING in every respect, every time I've observed her, previously. But in this film, I enjoyed both of their performances completely. Children in movies can also be an irritating presence, but Malinger and Hoffman were delightful as son Jonah, and his little neighbor/friend. Barbara Garrick, with a supporting role here (as in The Firm) is an appealing actress, for whom one would wish more prominent roles. Tom Hanks is one of the foremost actors of our time, but even he can go a smidgen too far in a characterization (I thought he did so in both Forrest Gump and Philadelphia). But he certainly didn't here. Watch, enjoy, and feel good.

Both Hanks' and Ryan's unsuitable partners appear to be perfectly nice people, yet the movie casually dismisses them over one little flaw apiece--the woman laughs like a hyena and the man has terrible allergies. Both characters behave very well, considering the way they're treated by others. Hanks' girlfriend in particular desires a medal for putting up with his brat of a son, who is rude to her at every opportunity.I also had difficulty warming to Hanks' son, although he is certainly preferable to the young girl who keeps expressing everything in initials.On the bright side, there are many engaging supporting characters, including Rob Reiner as a fellow architect. Also of note are the rich homeowner, the dotty babysitter and Rosie O'Donnell as Ryan's editor and friend.

It's stupid; it's annoying and it's wrong and it's another anti-family message that Hollywood loved to promote during this era. The message don't respect your parents. You know more than them. Stephen Spielberg was a big proponent of this kind of thinking in many of his early films.Combine that with the always-annoying Meg Ryan, who has yet to make a good movie, and you have an extremely overrated film in Sleepless In Seattle. I was not shocked to find out Nora Ephron was a big contributor to this movie, directing it and helping to write the screenplay. This is the same ultra-liberal/secular writer who followed up this film with garbage like Mixed Nuts, Michael and You've Got Mail.The characters in this film, beginning with Ryan's Annie Reed, are simply too unrealistic. Also, it's not recommended you fall in love with someone just by hearing their voice. It might help to get to know the person, in person, for quite some time before making a commitment.

It's not because it's romantic--Casablanca's one of my favorite films, and so are a slew of other romance movies.  It's not because it's cheesy, since I like a lot of those movies too.  And it's not because it has a boring plot, because it's really not boring at all.It's because this movie is utterly unfair towards guys.  There's two major reasons for this firstly, Bill Pullman's character is inhuman.  Secondly, if the genders of the two main characters were switched (i.e., if Meg Ryan played Tom Hanks' role and vice versa), Tom Hanks (the character played by Ryan) would be perceived as a total jerk.  I can't really explain these two things without mentioning spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you should probably skip the rest of this commentary.As for Pullman's character yes, if I had a fiancee in the same situation as Meg Ryan and she wanted to dump me for someone more suitable for her, I'd say ok.  But that's not to say I'd be extremely depressed and p***ed off at how much work I put into this relationship just to have mr. perfect walk by and lose everything.  I would also be at least a little bit disappointed that my fiancee didn't care enough about my own feelings to stay with me.  Pullman's character is expecting to have kids with this woman, and he seems perfectly fine--no, downright enthusiastic--with letting her go marry someone else.  I don't know any guy who would be nearly as consenting about this whole thing as Pullman's character.  Additionaly, this all seems to imply (for me at least) that a heterosexual relationship has nothing to do with the guy's happiness and everything to do with the girl's that the man is the provider of services, and the woman is the customer who has every right to leave if she's dissatisfied.How is this the case?  Well, imagine switching the genders of the two main characters.  Say it was Tom Hanks who was already with a woman he was going to marry, but decided to leave her (or ask her if he could leave her) when he heard this woman (Meg Ryan) on a radio talk show who sounded absolutely perfect for him.  Wouldn't Hanks be perceived as a total jerk who dumped his fiancee for someone else?  Wouldn't he be seen as an insensitive person who cared more about his own feelings and happiness than his fiancee's?  In the actual movie, however, it's Meg Ryan who dumps her fiancee, and since she acts cute and innocent when she does it, she's not perceived as a jerk.So, basically, that's my chief complaint about this film.  Other than that, it's very funny, and I like the acting.  Another thing I didn't like about it, though, is that it's the kind of movie where you're made to only care about the two main characters and nobody else.But ultimately I think that my main complaint about this movie is really a complaint about American dating culture.  It was really hard for me to figure out why I didn't like this movie, and I think that this movie really reveals how disadvantaged the stereotype of men is in dating culture. That's not to say that women aren't disadvantaged--the whole feminist movement is the embodiment of this fact--but all I'm trying to say is that men are also disadvantaged in different ways, and in my opinion dating culture needs to change for the equality of both sexes.

Indeed it's true. We all have an emotional connection in our lives to someone that is entirely unexplainable. It's a connection on a platonic level unlike the attraction of lust. This value of love has been misread entirely in Hollywood of today and movies with such innocent intentions are quite rare. SIS by director Norah Ephron holds onto the idea of platonic love. It in-fact personifies the mere idea of such platonic connections between two people. Norah Ephron who has a knack for movies of this category certainly takes her work to heart. It is indeed evident primarily with her preference on always casting Meg Ryan. Next it's the very seasonal touch (most movies are set during the holiday season) she adds onto them and then the medium she uses to bring her lovers together. Two individuals who have never seen nor heard of each other falls in love over a radio show and in another instance rivals in business who falls in love in a chat room.

Young Jonah who is smart for his age understands his fathers' grief and wishes only to see him happy. On Christmas eve Jonah calls in on a radio talk show and explains to the host his fathers' situation and subsequently Sam ends up on the phone pouring his heart out over the air of his love for Maggie. Sam is heard all over country to those who are tuned in, Including Annie (Meg Ryan) who is driving over to her fiancés parents' home for Christmas Eve dinner.

If that's not enough, working people with middle class life styles, seem to be doing nothing but to worry about their love life at work. I am so glad I saw this movie on TV so I would not have to go and ask for my money back.

Sleepless in Seattle sets the female gender back decades. Women randomly cry at the slightest stupid thing, send letters to some guy they've only heard on the radio one time because they're so desperate, and chase after impossible love because they're trying to recreate some unrealistic fantasy spawned by seeing far too many movies. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy corny, romantic movies, but Meg Ryan's character takes it to the extreme. EXTREMELY AWFUL!!! This movie is an embarrassment and an affront to women everywhere.

His eight year old son Jonah (Ross Malinger) misses his mother, but he wants his father to get a new wife despite Sam having not even contemplated dating again. On Christmas Eve, Jonah calls a national radio talk show and ask for a new wife for his Dad. Sam ends up pouring his heart out about his magical and perfect marriage to his late wife, and how much he still misses her. Among the many women who hear Sam's story and fall in love with him solely because of it is Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) a Baltimore-based newspaper writer. Who is drawn to Jim based on his story, despite already being engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman) 1993 was a massive year for Tom Hanks with both this movie and Philadelphia being huge hits. Both are very different, but are equally brilliant. As is Hanks. He is heartbreakingly excellent as the widower. Amazingly the role of Annie was originally offered to Julia Roberts, who turned it down. Kim Basinger also turned it down because she thought the premise was ridiculous (Good move Kim!!) After Michelle Pfeiffer, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jodie Foster all declined as well, Meg Ryan landed the role. I surprised this role was not wrote with Ryan in mind as this type of role was her bread and butter back then. She was perfect for this type of role. Rosie O Donnell is solid support to Ryan as is Bill Pullman, and Ross Malinger manages to avoid all the cliché's of most chicks actors! Well directed, with a sharp and witty script. I will add I also liked the fact that they didn't feel the need to make the Bill Pullman character a jerk (as is usual the case with his type of role in romantic comedies) One of my favourite Tom Hanks movies, one of my favourite Meg Ryan movies and one of my favourite romantic comedies. I don't own many romantic comedies. But this one is in my collection.

Tom Hanks, who effectively flexes his solemn-face muscles for most of the picture, is the titular Sleepless, a widower who doesn't believe in love after loss and can't close his eyes without getting tangled in painful memories. When his son convinces him to sit in on a call to a self-help radio program, he gains fame among the desperate middle-aged set. Mixed in among that pack is a not-quite-ready-to-be-married Meg Ryan, who obsesses over him to a worrying degree. It would be curious to see this play out with the roles reversed today - would it be dubbed a timeless romance or a dark dose of suspense? I was on the hook for that first act, but when the tone shifted to allow for more punchlines it lost its way and bucked me into the dirt. Mildly funny soap opera material for the most part, it's disappointing Hanks and Ryan didn't have a chance to revisit the chemistry they'd sparked in Joe Versus the Volcano - they only share the screen for a few moments.

Sam's son Jonah (Ross Malinger) is also yearning for a new mother and concocts a plan to put his father on national radio. As a result, hundreds of women write to him including Annie (Meg Ryan). While she is engaged, her strange and awkward fiancé led her to think twice on love and to attempt to meet Sam.Filmed and set in Seattle, Washington, this movie captures the beauty and relaxing atmosphere of the city and the coolness and freshness of the city's weather. This setting is perfect in describing Sam and Jonah's sad but hopeful situation in seeking a new chapter in their lives. Busy Baltimore, Maryland describes Annie's hectic life. What results is some fun entertainment seeing all the lengths Jonah goes through to make sure he finds the right woman for his dad and all the lengths Annie goes through to meet Sam. It's captivating to see the unfolding of events throughout the movie as they bring Sam and Annie from opposite sides of the country closer together.The acting was on-the-spot, nothing too overzealous, slapstick or childish, and the plot was steady-paced but intriguing. While this is a romantic comedy, there is a touch of adventure in the story, depicted in Jonah's campaign to get his dad a wife and Annie's campaign in attempts to find him.Overall, one of if not the best romantic comedies - one that would fill your hearts with hope, romance and laughter.Grade A "},{"Title":"stalking or romance?","Date":"28 December 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" A story about a man who wife passed away and he is lonely so his child takes over his Dad's life and tries to hook up dear old dad through the personals,, meanwhile on the other side of the country , a young woman listens to a radio show , and their is a caller, called Sleepless in Seattle,, she is drawn to him , so she figures out where he lives,, hops on a plane and tracks him down,, somehow she misses him at the Airport and the meeting is put off for now,, Rosie O' Donnell isn't bad in this,, Bill Pullman is in this,, and Meg Ryan plays opposite Tom Hanks,, not a bad movie,, there are a few shortcomings,, but they can be easily overlooked if you're looking for a feel good story with a decent ending,,, "},{"Title":"Once more up the ESB","Date":"23 June 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Just watched this movie again for the umpteenth time.

It's an unpretentious little jewel that demonstrates the true values of screen writing and acting, as both are used here shamelessly and with natural grace to manipulate the emotions of the audience. I admit the story is a bit absurd, but it's also somewhat the idea. And besides, in this age where people travel hundreds of miles to meet folks they've chatted with on the internet, is it so hard to believe that a woman would cross the entire country to learn about a widower whose voice she heard on the radio? Well, the Casanova in me would like to think it's not.The plot, though predictable, makes some daring twists. In most romantic comedies, the couple eyes each other from very early on. And although Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan do make an attractive movie-couple, they don't share even have a two-shot until the last ten minutes. For most of the movie, Mr. Hanks does not even know that Miss Ryan even exists, let alone that they are destined to be in love. It's not that he ignores her; it's because she spends most of the movie on the opposite side of the country from him. She hears him on the radio, speaking of his recently departed wife, is fascinated by what he has to say, and feels something that is best described, as the movie acknowledges, as magic. I could use more derisory words toward somebody who would feel this way in real life about a voice, but that's good enough.The screenplay (written by director Nora Ephron and two men&#x97;Jeff Arch and David S. Ward) is also a bit insightful on, again, an unpretentious level. It does not delve deep into the psychological state we like to call love and affection, but it does make some interesting observations. First of all, Miss Ryan's character does acknowledge time and time again how absurd it is of her to fly from New York to Seattle to learn about a man she's only heard. There are also numerous touches upon how Hollywood's perception of sex and romance befalls some people. The key moment is when Rosie O'Donnell, as Miss Ryan's best friend, tells her flat out while watching An Affair to Remember that what she wants is not to be in love, but to be in love in a movie. After all, how many of us&#x97;single and once-single&#x97;have not looked at movies like Casablanca, An Affair to Remember, At First Sight, and such and not fantasized about passion that only seems to exist when an actor and actress play make-believe before a camera?Speaking of other films that is another thing I adored about Sleepless in Seattle. It has an uncanny ability to recall other films to effect&#x97;sometimes comedic, sometimes insightful. A favorite moment of mine is when Mr. Hanks explains to his eight-year-old son (extremely well-acted by Ross Malinger) why he is uncomfortable about rushing into a new relationship so soon he asks him if he ever saw Fatal Attraction. The biggest homage(s), though, goes back to An Affair to Remember. That wonderful 1957 film is shown on television screens numerous times throughout the movie, and at key points, Hugo Friedhofer's score even plays on the soundtrack. Being an obvious admirer of the said film, I found the references quite delightful and charming.If there is one thing I couldn't stand about Sleepless in Seattle, I would have had to have been the constant usage of classic songs to carry along sequences. The opening credits display while a very jazzy version of As Time Goes By thumps in the background, but numbers such as Stand By Your Man, Stardust, and others are ever-present, reducing fine scenes into what appear to be limp music videos. There is a potentially great moment&#x97;reduced to a merely good one&#x97;where Miss Ryan, having traveled to Seattle, watches Mr. Hanks and his son as they play on the beach. It's a very good scene (Miss Ryan is kept at medium shots, Mr. Hanks and Mr. Malinger at distance, the montage is very nice) but the song playing in the background trivializes it. The film's musical score by Marc Shaiman is just fine, and I would have preferred to hear his piano motifs instead of a song.Only the movies can convince that two people could fall into deep, passionate love upon first sight. Sleepless in Seattle is one of the defining examples of that theory. After all, if Mr. Hanks and Miss Ryan could have such strong chemistry when they are not even sharing the same frame, one can only imagine what would lay down the road for their characters (and how moved we would be). But what is best about this movie&#x97;apart from the fabulous writing and acting&#x97;is its unostentatious manner. It does not make itself out to be any big deal, and just lets the romantic chemistry emerge on its admittedly old-fashioned terms. And I was more interested in the relationship between these people who have never met as opposed to most formula-films where the cute-boy meets cute-girl, they ogle for an hour, hate one another for twenty minutes, and reconcile at the end. Sleepless in Seattle is one of the more significant romantic comedies of the last 20 years.

I was, therefore, only able to enjoy _Sleepless in Seattle_ while gnashing my teeth quite frequently._Sleepless in Seattle_ is about as subtle as a sledgehammer in driving home its message that there exist phenomena such as soul mate, being destined for each other, true love at first sight, etc. Its conception of love is extremely old-fashioned; it's supposed to be that thing where one meets one, and you are my everything, you're the world to me. It's strange, but somehow you instantly feel that _Sleepless in Seattle_ is an irreligious movie; it's not that it would be *against religion*, but you get the definite feeling right from the start that love in its religious dimension is and will remain conspicuously absent from the movie. This is all the more remarkable in that _Sleepless in Seattle_ glorifies and uses motives from the 1957 Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr hit, _An Affair to Remember_ -- a romantic comedy as well, but where religion and religious feelings are as obviously present as they are non-existent in _Sleepless in Seattle_.I believe in none of those things such as destiny, soul mates, being made for one another, you're the only one, etc. And I'm sorry, but as the movie kept reiterating these motives ad nauseam (especially in many of the intentionally old-fashioned songs -- both original and fake new ones written in the old vein, frequently featuring awful, annoyingly maudlin lyrics -- that we get to listen to throughout the movie, from the opening to the closing credits), I just *had* to say to myself All this 'destingy stuff' is something typically enjoyed and believed by women. There's nothing wrong with a movie or book that makes it obvious that its author is a woman; however, this seemed to be *too* obvious in _Sleepless in Seattle_, detracting from the overall enjoyment. I was saying to myself, This is a chicks' movie, long before Tom Hanks said the same thing about _An Affair to Remember_; but it's a verdict that is even more apropos in relation to _Sleepless in Seattle_.Speaking of the comparison to _An Affair to Remember_, it's weird that _Sleepless in Seattle_ seems more archaic than the movie that preceded it by almost 3 decades. Both movies feature wildly improbable, unrealistic story-lines; yet when you come to think of it, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr might meet on a luxury ship in 2012 just as they did back in 1957; it would no longer be a transatlantic voyage today, but a pleasurable cruise. Could, however, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan interact, today, in the same way as shown in _Sleepless in Seattle_? Nope. This movie fairly screams at you Where's the Internet? Where are the mobile phones, emails, and social networks? Only a few years later, and the movie's plot would be rendered unusable. Even as it is, great effort is required to suspend your disbelief; while _An Affair to Remember_ is unrealistic, _Sleepless in Seattle_ is doubly so. Or can anyone honestly believe that a loving father would not have alerted the police immediately upon learning that his 8-year-old son eloped on a transcontinental flight to New York unsupervised? Despite all these shortcomings, _Sleepless in Seattle_ manages to be enjoyable throughout, and unlike _An Affair to Remember_, I believe this movie gets better and better with every passing minute. I found the ending of _An Affair to Remember_ rather a let-down, but not here; I thought the Empire State Building finale of _Sleepless in Seattle_ was very nicely constructed, and genuinely moving.I'd say the main credit for the movie's success should go to the two leading stars. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both give brilliant, flawless performances. They seem thoroughly believable as persons or personalities, even while their actions do not. The two child actors, Ross Malinger and Gaby Hoffmann, are terrific as well. Rosie O'Donnell makes her presence felt forcefully in a supporting role; her delivery of several of the movie's wittiest lines, no matter how brief, is pitch-perfect. Victor Garber and Rob Reiner only get a few minutes of screen time, but they certainly make the most of them to shine and to delight the audience.(I thought I only noticed a single false note about the actors' performances. In a weird departure from their realistic mode of delivery throughout the movie, in a discussion at Sam's kitchen table, both Tom Hanks and Victor Garber get tearful while talking about the movie _The Dirty Dozen_. I thought the scene rang very false; it was as if a minute or two from your regular TV sitcom was suddenly inserted into _Sleepless in Seattle_; the only thing missing was canned laughter; I found the moment painful to watch, and not funny at all; fortunately, it only lasted a minute or so; and Rita Wilson did not join in the two actors' shenanigans, but rather rescued the scene thanks to remaining who she was supposed to be in the movie. I thought Hanks & Garber did not perform well in that particular brief and untypical moment, but it would be hard to blame them for it; rather, I'd say it was a mistake on the part of the screenwriter/director to include a heterogeneous moment like that in the script.)

The climactic meeting at the top of the Empire State Building is a reference to a reunion between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember that fails to happen because the Kerr character is struck by a car while en route. The film is a romantic comedy film directed and co-written by Nora Ephron. Based on a story by Jeff Arch, it stars Tom Hanks as Sam Baldwin and Meg Ryan as Annie Reed together with Bill Pullman,Ross Malinger,Rosie O'Donnell,Rob Reiner and David Hyde Pierce.Sam Baldwin, a Chicago architect, loses his wife to cancer. He and his young son Jonah start new lives in Seattle, but Sam still grieves. 18 months later, on Christmas Eve 1992, Jonah&#x97;who wants his father to find a new wife&#x97;calls into a talk radio show. Jonah persuades Sam to go on the air to talk about how much he misses his wife. Hundreds of women from around the country hear the program, and touched by the story, write to Sam.One of the listeners is Annie Reed, a Baltimore Sun reporter. She is engaged to a sweet, awkward man named Walter but feels there is something missing from their relationship. After watching the film An Affair to Remember, Annie impulsively writes a letter suggesting that Sam meet her on top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day. She does not intend to mail it, but her friend and editor Becky does it for her and agrees to send Annie to Seattle to look into doing a story on those radio shows.Sam begins dating a coworker, Victoria, whom Jonah dislikes. Jonah, a baseball fan, reads Annie's letter and likes that it mentions the Baltimore Orioles but fails to convince his father to go to New York to meet Annie. On the advice of his friend Jessica, Jonah replies to Annie agreeing to the New York meeting.While dropping Victoria off at the airport for a flight, Sam sees Annie exiting from her plane and is taken by her, although he has no idea who she is. Annie watches Sam and Jonah playing on the beach together but mistakes Sam's sister Suzy for his girlfriend. He recognizes her from the airport and says Hello, but Annie can only respond with another hello before fleeing. She decides she is being foolish and goes to New York to meet Walter for Valentine's Day.With Jessica's help, Jonah flies to New York without his father's permission. Sam, distraught, follows Jonah and finds him on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Annie sees the skyscraper from the Rainbow Room, where she is dining with Walter, and confesses her doubts to him. They amicably end their engagement. Jonah and Sam get on the down elevator just before Annie reaches the observation deck. She finds Jonah's backpack. Jonah and Sam return for the backpack and meet Annie. They leave, Sam and Annie walking off hand in hand.It was obviously contrived and the plot devices were used to manipulate the story but it was a romantic weeper.The team effort of Tom Hanks,Meg Ryan and Nora Ephron made a real effort to make the story work.Also,with two of the most likable stars casted,it was worth the view as they made it possible to be both satisfying and entertaining.

Strictly speaking, Sleeping in Seattle is made up of two story lines, one is about a recently widowed man who moves to Seattle and does nothing but grieve. The other is features a woman journalist from Baltimore, who overhears the broadcast with Hanks's son pouring his heart out about his concerns for dad and decides to track him down.The scenery is striking, the soundtrack is very welcoming, the direction is solid and the script has heart and wit. In terms of acting, both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan give marvellous lead performances, while Ross Malinger is a nice surprise as Hanks's son. The climax at the top of the Empire State Building takes its inspiration from the 1950s weepie An Affair to Remember(with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr), and is very effective.Overall, a charming and enjoyable film.

Well, at LEAST she was honest with him, when she went to meet Tom Hanks near the end. She did NOT leave him hanging, as many Women (or men, if the situation were reversed) would do, without worrying about the pain they had caused the other person.But hey, if she did not really love Bill Pullman, why should she have just settled for him? If hearing of Tom hanks situation gave her second thoughts on Marrying Pullman, she shouldn't have gone through with the marriage. After all, ENGAGEMENTS are supposed to be a time to decide if this is the person you want for the rest of your life.Having said that, let's not forget that this just a movie. As such, it is a GOOD one, that tugs at the heartstrings, and is just one of those movies that will make a person fell warm inside, especially at the end.Plus, you do NOT have to be a woman to be touched by this movie. As a 37 year old single male, I am touched whenever I see this movie, and I saw it when it was new. I do not really consider this to be a chick flick, and do not get emotional at a lot of such movies. For example I saw Titanic, at the end of '97, on it's first run. I went with my sister and cousin. BOTH of them cried hard near, and at, the end, and one woman behind us was crying uncontrollably. NOT ME.

Tom Hanks got so much praise in the late nineties, especially around the time of his back to back Best Actor Oscars that i find myself resenting his success, but looking back at Sleepless in Seattle just reminds me what a terrific actor he is. Recently, i found him giving a delightful, unique characterisation of Carl Hanratty in Catch me if you Can, and another genuine, unique character in Road to Perdition. I also look forward to his (from the previous) hilarious comic performance in the Coen Brothers latest The Ladykillers).A perfect example of the preciseness and emotional truth of Hanks' performance is the first time the lady on the romance advice radio station gets him on the phone, when he tells about his own life, his problems and especially his late wife, i was struck by the perfect tone he achieved (and from judging Nora Ephron's other work, such as Mixed Nuts, this probably has more to do with him than her) when you talk about your own problems and your own life in a public environment like on the radio, you don't sound like you're trying to make people feel sorry for you, there is a certain slightly embarrassed, yet indescribably way you do it, and Hanks nails it beautifully, so that i'm still thinking about it a week later.Ephron's script is self-referential with the genre, yet it still believes in the traditional story of the genre, which is unashamedly sweet.With a gorgeous soundtrack of classic jazz vocalists, Sleepless in Seattle is a modern romance classic, one much loved by many people, which is an achievement to be admired.

Alas, there are a lot of movies in that genre that I enjoy (must be the frustrated actor in me). Sleepless in Seattle  is a movie about a man (Sam played by Tom Hanks) who lost his wife to cancer. His young son calls a radio call-in show because he is concerned about his father's emotional welfare and feels he needs to have another woman in his life. This causes a barrage of women including a woman in Baltimore (Annie superbly played by Meg Ryan) to send in letter dying to meet Sam who has now been dubbed Sleepless in Seattle by the radio program. This leads to a very interesting storyline that you must see to appreciate. One last note, this movie will have many viewers wanting to see An Affair to Remember just to find out why all these women in Sleepless in Seattle are crying.

Who doesn't like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan? Even better, who doesn't like them together?This is a slight variation on the typical love story. The story is really less about the developing love between two people and more about the potential love between two people. It kind of reminds me of the two strangers who happen to be sitting across the aisle from each other on the train. They are attracted to each other. The more they look, the more they like. That process, albeit simplistic, is kind of what this movie is about.They both find out about each other, communicate long distance briefly, become infatuated with each other - and with the help of Hank's son, in a somewhat preposterous manner, find each other - and, presumably, each other's love.My only lasting criticism - and one I can't quite put my finger on - was the very, very end.

Now you ask Why is such a maudlin movie so wonderful? The answer is because of two of the finest actors in Hollywood today, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Their portrayal of two lonely people searching for love and unwilling to settle for second-best transforms a meandering script into a story that will touch anyone who has ever felt lonely or isolated or has suffered a loss of someone close and special to them. Indeed this movie deals candidly with the challenges associated with trying to meet someone in a society that fosters isolation, fear and outright paranoia. That the two main characters in this movie are able to transcend those barriers is what makes this movie so special, for it offers the possibility of hope for even the most desperately lonely people who just need a little bit of encouragement to get out into the world and meet that special someone. "},{"Title":"One of the best romantic comedies ever to come along","Date":"29 July 2003","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Early Plot points of the movieA lot of people who have viewed Sleepless In Seattle, see it as nothing more than a chick flick, a date movie, or just a plain old predictable romantic comedy.  It is so much more than that.  It is a superbly acted, wonderfully written, flawlessly directed tribute to all romantic films.  Nora Ephron, put it this way when she said, This is not a film about romance, this is a film about romance in the movies, and during Sleepless we are given many references to An Affair to Remember to illustrate just that.The film opens in Chicago with Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) and his son Jonah, at the funeral of Sam's wife Maggie.  We do not see them close up, but we get a voice over by Sam, trying to explain to Jonah why these things happen.  The film then cuts directly to Sam, who is an architect, at work, being given a card for a support group by a co-worker.  Sam, removes several similar cards from his pocket, and as he throws them to the table reading them, we sense his frustration that although people are trying to be helpful, there is no way they can possibly understand what his life is now like without Maggie.  It is here that he decides to take Jonah away from Chicago and move to Seattle.  If these opening scenes had been played with too much pathos, then the whole concept of the film could have been lost.  Tom Hanks, does these scenes with perfection, setting just the right tone to enable us to understand his loss but not become so lost in it that the whole film sinks.We then move forward a year to Christmas Eve.  Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) is going with her fiance Walter (Bill Pullman) to her parent's home to announce their engagement.  Though it appears to be the perfect relationship, there are little signs given throughout these opening moments that lets the audience know what Annie doesn't. Perhaps this isn't such a perfect match, and Annie has convinced herself that it is.  Later, Annie is driving her car alone, down the highway to join Walter in Baltimore.  It is here that she tunes her radio to one of those programs where people call in to get advice, in this case a Dr. Marcia.  Coincidentally, (where would most films be without that word!), Jonah has called Dr. Marcia to ask advice about Sam, as it seems Jonah senses that Sam's depressed and is unable to sleep.  Dr. Marcia convinces Jonah to put Sam on the phone.  It is in this sequence, that Meg Ryan shines.  Acting and reacting to something you hear on the radio is one thing, but as Annie, Meg Ryan is required to do it for a good length of time.  When she is listening to Sam's voice, telling why he loved his wife so much, we believe her reaction, and we understand it.  These scenes were perhaps the most crucial part of the film.  If we don't believe Annie at this point, then we won't believe any of the actions that she takes afterward.  From this point on, we are left to wonder if these two people who seem to be made for each other will ever meet.  Of course, you probably know that going in, but this film gets us there with a keen sense of humor, terrific characters, and a story not only about fate, but whether falling in love with someone you never met is possible.Rosie O'Donnell is perfectly cast as Meg's friend Becky, and delivers her lines in such a matter-of-fact tone that lines like A movie! That's your problem! You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie prove to be even funnier.  Bill Pullman, as Walter, is required to overplay his part, so that we know he isn't the right match for Annie.  He does it well, just enough to let us in on the mismatch, but not annoying to the point where we dislike him.  He is a good guy, and as Annie says to him later, deserves better than me.  Ross Malinger as Jonah also does well, never being overly sweet, or too obnoxious.  He makes us believe in his relationship with Sam, and that he really wants his father to be happy again.  Gaby Hoffman, as Jonah's friend Jessica, is priceless in her few scenes with him.  Rob Reiner as Jay, giving advice to Sam on dating in the eighties, has one of his best supporting roles ever.  His scenes alone are worth taking time to  watch Sleepless.Nora Ephron deserves high praise for having given us this romantic-comedy gem.  It has all the ingredients one could ask for from beginning to end.  As Sam and Annie might say, It has magic.  "},{"Title":"A typical women-romance movie.

She along with 2000 other women who heard Tom Hanks charactor on a call in radio talk show, ala frasier and now thinks that HE is the one for her. Despite logic, reason, or plausability you KNOW what is going to happen. I mean it's a love story for crying out loud so I suppose it's not really THAT cliche, but puullleeeezzzz. Meeting at the top of the Empire State Building when the building just happens to have a Heart on it (Oh, yeah, it was valentines day). Can you gag? The best part of this movie was Jonah's little friend Jessica, who had all the answers, enough to get them together, book him an airline flight and give cute little anagrams. She was funny and interesting. As for the rest of the characters in this movie I found them dull and extremely uninteresting. I really couldn't care less if they got together or not. There was nothing wrong with the acting, and all in all it wasn't the worst way to spend 2 hours, but I remember 10 years ago when this movie was in the theaters and people made such a big deal about it. Having finally watching it from beginning to end without falling asleep I really can't understand why.

It's fair to say my wife liked it more than I did.For me it wasn't really very funny and worse, was guilty of over-sentimentality and coincidence. Nothing against Meg Ryan, but she hasn't got the kind of face that would stop you in your tracks the way she does at the airport with Tom Hanks' character's first view of her. Moreover her ditzy character doesn't seem too different (sans hysterical laugh) from the girl his son is so against him hooking up with.Oh yes, about the son, aged eight going on eighteen, going out with a fellow eight-year-old girl, quoting from Beatles' songs, having adult conversations with his dad and flying to New York on his own. As he would! Of course his toothy grin and mop of hair sweep aside any charges of embarrassing cringeworthiness, or at least that's what the director would have you think.I found the writing clichéd and gauche (a woman character cries when recounting the story of the An Affair To Remember, Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr vehicle which informs much of the plot here; like when was the last time you cried explaining a movie plot),the thirty-something characters are cardboard-thin and irritating plus it seemed there had to be some old romantic song playing in the background of almost every scene.I couldn't get excited by the acting either, there being no chance for Hanks and Ryan to gell as they don't actually meet until their anti-climactic meeting atop the Empire State Building. Bill Paxton gets underused as Ryan's hypochondriac fiancé while Rosie O'Donnell irritates as her overly understanding boss. I have to admit I can't stand these male-female buddy relationships as demonstrated here by Hanks and Rob Reiner and Ryan and O'Donnell, they play out so artificially.Just about the only good for thing me about this film is that I'll probably seek out the earlier film, confident that it will eclipse this very slack and shallow 1980's production which it regrettably inspired.

As the movie unfolds it became increasing obvious that the actors do not actually believe in their roles. Surprisingly, even a fine actor like Tom Hanks does such a subpar performance. Could this be the same Tom Hanks that won two consecutive Oscars in the following two years? Many critics praise the film for its warm atmosphere. Could the mediocre performances of the actors have contributed to this warmth? When all logics and intelligence fail to work, producers of this movie decided to put in half a dozen of beautiful scenes. We see fireworks, we see view of the city Chicago, and we see this lovely sight of the State Empire building with a red love star... How many souls could these scenes truly stir? Well we can be sure that none of the souls of our fellow actors of this movie were.

When Sam is looking for his son, a piano is used for music, which is slow and soft with minor sad notes. The music however builds up as Sam and Annie get closer together, changing to happy playful tunes, a song of triumph. This creates such an emotional response in the viewers as it tells the viewer how to feel just by the tender sad notes or playful happy notes.The cessation of music creates suspense, a moment for viewers to breathe and wonder what will happen next. Music was controlling the entire ending of Sleepless in Seattle, it unearthed emotions within me because the music took me on a journey whilst watching images, rather than the images taking me on a journey. The power of positive and negative notes in music cannot be measured and Sleepless in Seattle uses music with purpose and intent. This is one of my favourite all time movies!!!

I've got to be honest, I was uncertain about whether or not to watch it because of the reviews, but I thought about it and ended up giving it a try. Now, I have finished watching the movie and I must say, I found the movie very warm and touching. At the same time, the movie seemed to have a little too much forced exposition. There were a couple of moments in the beginning of the film that didn't seem to flow. For an example, it was strange how a woman on one side of a country could feel such a strong connection with a random helpless man on the other side of the country. That man, Sam, is none of her business and she doesn't even know him, but that's what makes the film so ironic. I found that part of the plot very unrealistic, but, I guess, cute in a way. Nevertheless, the plot of the film was interesting to me. As for the acting, Tom Hanks surely did a great job playing his character, and his character seemed the most realistic in this film. Sam never knew that Annie was the right woman for him until he saw her in person. I enjoy the films that Tom Hanks is in, like Big, for an example, and I really enjoyed his performance in this film as well. Meg's character, on the other hand, got a little too dramatic at times. When she got dramatic, the movie felt more like a sitcom, like Good Luck Charlie, but I would rather not ruin the beauty of this film because there are many positive things for me to say about this film. I definitely found Ross' character cute. Although I felt sympathy for Jonah at times, I didn't understand how he felt such a strong connection between Sam and Annie. Maybe there was something that I missed in the film that was included in the letter that Annie sent to Sam. Besides that, the acting was very well done!I loved the music that played throughout the film and it seemed to fit the theme very well! It made the film seem more like an older film from the 50s or 60s. A lot of the music sounded a lot like Frank Sinatra, which is commonly played in romantic situations. I have honestly never watched a romantic film before, nor are romantic films my type of movies, but I was truly impressed after watching Sleepless in Seattle. I would recommend this film to anyone; there is nothing inappropriate in this film for younger children, so I think children would also enjoy this. I understand how one could dislike this film, but I do think that this film is very cute, which I hope others can see in this film.

After his wife Maggie passes away, Sam Baldwin and his 8-year-old son Jonah relocate from Chicago to Seattle to escape the grief associated with Maggie's death. Eighteen months later Sam is still grieving and can't sleep. Although Jonah misses his mother, he wants his father to get a new wife despite Sam having not even contemplated dating again. On Christmas Eve, Sam (on Jonah's initiative) ends up pouring his heart out on a national radio talk show about his magical and perfect marriage to Maggie, and how much he still misses her. Among the many women who hear Sam's story and fall in love with him solely because of it is Annie Reed, a Baltimore-based newspaper writer. Annie's infatuation with Sam's story and by association Sam himself is despite being already engaged. But Annie's relationship with her straight-laced fiancé Walter is unlike her dream love life in the movie An Affair to Remember (1957). She even writes to Sam proposing they meet atop the Empire State Building on. Roger Ebert wrote The plot mechanics, in fact, reminded me of some of those contrived 1940s and 1950s romantic melodramas where events conspired to bring the lovers close but no closer, and then the writers toyed with us bymanufacturing devices to keep them apart. By the end of Sleepless in Seattle, we're hoping the lovers will meet atop the Empire State Building (a steal from An Affair to Remember), and the movie is doing everything to keep that from happening short of assigning Donald Trump to tear it down. The actors are well-suited to this material. Tom Hanks keeps a certain detached edge to his character, which keeps him from being simply a fall guy. Meg Ryan, who is one of the most likable actresses around and has a certain ineffable Doris Day innocence, is able to convince us of the magical quality of her sudden love for a radio voice, without letting the device seem like the gimmick is assuredly is. It is entertaining but it wouldn't make any of my top lists.

The movie stars Tom Hanks as a widowed father who has to rear his young son Jonah all by himself as he lost his wife. So he ends up moving from Chicago to Seattle and we are introduced to Annie Reed(played by Kate & Leopold star Meg Ryan who looks very pretty here may I add and unlike her other charcther in that other film I have mentioned)who is engaged to Walter(played by While You Were Sleeping star Bill Pullman)and Annie is sharing Christmas with her family with Walter. So when she leaves her parents house she turns on the radio in her car and hears a young boy wanting to make a request for his dad to find a wife and love again. Annie feels so sorry for the young boy she ends up writing a letter to him to give to his dad (Tom Hanks) and from here on in its all about destiny and faith to bring Annie and Tom Hanks' charcther together. So will they won't they? Overall I found this movie to be actually really nice. Its definitely up there as one of my favourite romantic movies of all time next to the likes of Titanic and While You Were Sleeping.The soundtrack is very old- fashioned,and parts of the movie is referring to that Cary Grant romantic movie An Affair To Remember where the charcther waits for his soulmate on top of the empire state building and he waits and waits for the woman to arrive. This also happens towards the end of the movie. Now my only nitpick with this movie is Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks chemistry.,don't get me wrong these guys have worked together three times before; Joe Versus Volcano,this movie and of course You've Got Mail where they had chemistry as their charcthers in that movie. Here they don't spend that amount of screen time together and I wish they did because there charchters in Sleepless In Seattle were perfect for each other. But hey I guess the late Nora Elphon wanted it to be like An Affair To Remember as well as trying out something different where its all about faith and destiny and not on the two charcthers to kiss at the end.Overall I give it a 7.8/10 "},{"Title":"Hanks and Ryan with Malinger","Date":"29 June 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Ross Malinger played Jonah the son of Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) who loses his wife and ends up on a radio station thanks to his sons mother-missing attitude. Well there really is no point going over the full details as this title has already been reviewed to death but little is known about Ross Malinger (Jonah) who is listed on Wikipedia as being a 'former' actor and now works as a General Manager. Many may remember him as the Bar mitzvah boy in Seinfeld where he takes quite an unhealthy liking to Elaine being a 'Shiksa' or Jewish goddess in Seinfeld - which was quite a departure from his character in Sleepless. Although the movie centres around Hanks and Ryan as they hopelessly find their way to each other - it is all due to the tenacity of young Jonah who despite what his father thinks, knows in his heart that Annie (Ryan) is the right woman for his dad. Through his cunning and adventure, even taking a plane flight to the Empire State building in New York Jonah manages to finally bring the two together is a memorable touching and no doubt tear jerking finale. If you haven't seen 'Sleepless' you must have come from another planet, so rent it or watch it on your PC through one of those movie web sites as it really is a movie to remember. Even the toughest baddass will find it hard to not weep just a little - 9 stars.

Meanwhile, Annie Reed is stuck in a stagnant engagement with fiancé, Walter (Bill Pullman) Annie listens to Sam's heartfelt speech about his deceased wife, causing Annie to get rather infatuated with Sam. She writes Sam a letter, suggesting they meet on the Empire State Building. Sam likes the sound of Annie, but he has to stop his dad from making a big mistake with another woman. I'm a big fan of romantic comedies, but I never understood the hype from this movie. Yes, its charming. Yes, it's cute, but people act like it's one of the all time greats. I don't think it's anywhere near deserving of that type of praise. I've never seen An Affair to Remember, but this type of stuff doesn't happen in real life. Your suspension of disbelief is a must with this one. If you can get into the outrageous plot, you'll more than likely find a decent amount to like about this one. It milks everything it can out of the unbelievable plot with two of the greatest movie stars in the history of cinema. Unlike You've Got Mail, this movie features wonderful performances. Tom Hanks is at his charming best, showing all the right emotions. Meg Ryan is the queen of romantic comedies, and there is a reason for it. Even watching her sing Jingle Bells manages to make me smile. I had a crush on Meg Ryan, who didn't at one juncture? Her character is sassy and enjoyable in this one. Ross Malinger is solid as the kid. He had some great gag scenes, holding his own against some amazing actors as well. Bill Pullman is OK as Ryan's fiancé, but a tad too dry and dull for my liking. I hate it when non-actors get a huge supporting role in a movie, especially someone I detest like Rosie O'Donnell. Surprisingly enough, she was tolerable here, and dare I say, enjoyable at times? The ending always makes me smile. I like how they ended things with a bang, yet subtly as well. It was a nice touchThey tried to produce the same formula in You've Got Mail, only it failed miserably.

I am a huge Hanks fan he has such a passion and commitment to every single movie he does. I have loved all of his movies that i have seen him in so far. and do I like him in this film?Well I suppose - This movie is about love and all its complications dealing with Sam / Annie and Jonah. The Three of them are trying to find  magic  in a relationship - I personally have not yet felt magic in a relationship - I have not even dated at all so I do not relate to  magic  but I can somehow imagine the delightful feeling in ones heart when you see the difference in Annie as the movie goes on and she learns what magic feels like. The movie seemed just a little slow in the beginning in my opinion but after a bit it has a certain pace to it that is enjoying. The movie reminds me of a few other films yet Hanks and Ryan are charming and The Kid also helps out the movie go forward / I also believe that Hanks other films success kind of help / Hurt this one in away - I mean Im not comparing it to his other roles but this one seems specifically about love - and I would say its like 70 % romantic and 30 % comedy but again I liked the movie for what it set up and Tom / Meg and the kid did a good job in this film - also a little note I feel that Rob Reiner and Rosie O' Donnell were just alright in there supporting roles but in my opinion they would be under minor roles for this movie. I have to mention a scene that I liked was Annie watching Sam and Jonah goofing around on the beach - thats were it seemed to click for Annie to realize she was in love with both them from just watching them goof around - being themselves , I believe from then on she felt deep down  magic for Sam and even in away Jonah. That moment was something I would call a  spark  were it just was beautiful for what it was. That moment you could tell what her heart said to her. Final thoughts ? well Toms Hanks did an amazing job plays such likable and relatable characters ( including this one ) Meg did a decent job -Pullman who played Walter did alright the role kinda fell short - Like your about to marry her and you let her walk away ? He could have developed more. Also i would say like 2 or 3 slow bits that could have been tweaked. Other then that its a cute movie about love and Magic. Its worth watching once in your life.

She seeks advice from the classic Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr movie An Affair to Remember, which she watches on t.v. very often. The story does have a warm and happy ending. The story has different settings-Chicago, New York, Baltimore, as well as Seattle. The very versatile Tom Hanks does his turn well, and the unusually appealing Meg Ryan captivated my attention in her role as Annie Reed. Ross Mallinger does acting well for a very young boy.

What is innovative and gentle in this 1993 flick, are it's characters. The Hero is widowed, has a kid. The Heroine doesn't love the person she supposed she would.

You want to be in love in a movie.","Date":"23 September 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Sleepless in Seattle is written and directed by Nora Ephron. It's based on a story by Jeff Arch and it stars Tom Hanks as Sam Baldwin and Meg Ryan as Annie Reed. The film takes its inspiration from An Affair to Remember and uses both its theme song and clips from the film in critical scenes. Plot sees Sam recently widowed and tricked by his young son Jonah to chat on the phone about his grief on a late night radio show. His honesty and sadness touches the hearts of America's listening females, particularly Annie, a young journalist who lives the other side of the country in Baltimore.Major smash hit at the box office, where it coined in a $200 million profit before it even made it out for rental, Sleepless In Seattle is the sort of romantic comedy that's almost impossible not to like. OK, there's those who probably have aversions to some of the stars in the piece (tho both Ryan & Hanks are adorable here), but as a story it's warm, sweet and very touching. Ephron's script throws up a number of funny treats along the way, including moments to make the boys smile, while the fact that the potential cross country lovers are kept apart for almost the entirety of the film is smart move that pays off dividends. Admirable support to Hanks & Ryan comes from Rosie O'Donnell & Rob Reiner as the best friends of both, while Ross Malinger as Jonah gives one of the more pleasing child performances from the 90s.It doesn't push the boundaries of light entertainment, but really you would have to be devoid of heart to not feel just a bit better for having sat thru this movie. 7/10 "},{"Title":"One of the best romantic movies out there","Date":"4 September 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Let's face it Guys usually don't like romantic movies.

Maybe the well told story about a guy who lost the love of his live and a women who's looking for this love.

And sure enough, I was right. The plot may be ridiculous and the surrounding cast may play second fiddle to the two leads but that doesn't stop this sickly sweet rom-com from feeling like a good, old-fashioned romantic chick-flick. But whereas recent dross like 27 Dresses or The Accidental Husband struggle to overcome their plot holes (and boy, are there many!), Sleepless In Seattle feels much classier and you soon forget that what you're watching is complete nonsense.A young-looking Tom Hanks plays Sam, a recently widowed architect who moves with his young son Jonah (Ross Malinger) to Seattle in a desperate bid to overcome his grief. After being duped by his son into talking on national radio about his feelings of despair, he strikes a chord into the hearts of many including Baltimore journalist Annie (Meg Ryan) who becomes obsessed with the caller dubbed Sleepless In Seattle. Trouble is, she is engaged to marry the safe and dependable (read boring) Walter (Bill Pullman). Are her doubts pre-wedding day jitters or a sign that maybe, her true-love lies further afield?It's unusual these days to find a rom-com that actually is romantic or funny so Sleepless In Seattle is a pleasant surprise by being both. Yes, it's sad as well especially when Hanks goes on about how much he misses his wife. But Hanks also has fun in the role - his banter with Rob Reiner is good for a laugh, as is Ryan's interaction with Rosie O'Donnell and Pullman. And for anyone looking for an old-fashioned sob-fest then they won't be disappointed either as this film piles on the schmultz towards the end, presumably to make you forget how silly the story is. Trouble is, like all romantic films, it is deeply predictable despite the implausibility - Notting Hill was the same, offering nothing resembling a surprise or twist in any way, shape or form. But in truth, who cares when it is expertly performed, brilliantly scored and wonderfully presented schmultz? Sleepless In Seattle isn't perfect but it is a hell of a lot better than a fistful of other rom-coms I could rattle off, including its spiritual sequel You've Got Mail. In my experience, women want films that move them, that tug on the heart-strings and play havoc with your tear ducts. Sleepless In Seattle will do the trick all right but for me personally, I'd liked a bit more plausibility to make this tale of star-crossed lovers more enjoyable. People fall in and out of love everyday in normal circumstances so why does Hollywood feel the need to jazz up a good story even more? Maybe I'm being overly critical because this is a good film and any rom-com fan worthy of the title will watch it anyway. Let me put it this way my wife went to sleep halfway through (she'd seen it before) but still wants the Blu-Ray for Christmas. Looks like I'm not done watching this just yet...

It's a film that is in part based on the high tech culture that the Nineties spawned with computers and nationwide talk radio. How could have you done a film like this in another time?Well romance is certainly eternal and if the way humans connect is different now, the point is they still connect. And this film takes up the proposition that some folks are fated to be mated.If I had ever done this thing for either of my parents back in the day or something similar I shudder to think of the consequences. But when young Ross Malinger calls a radio psychologist played in voice only by Caroline Aaron about his father it sets off an entire chain of events that make you believe in fate.Tom Hanks is the recently widowed father of Malinger they've just finished burying his wife Carey Lowell and he thinks a change of scenery is in order to assuage his grief. Hanks and Malinger move to Seattle and its from their new home in Seattle that young Master Malinger makes his fateful call. Hanks gets on the phone as well and his story touches female hearts across America and he's known by the moniker of Sleepless In Seattle.One of those touched hearts is Meg Ryan's who is ready to marry Bill Pullman who is playing what used to be called the Ralph Bellamy role. Good old reliable steady Bill, but Meg is hearing a different calling and taking her cues from that Leo McCarey classic, An Affair To Remember she goes in a nationwide hunt for Hanks.More cynical folks than myself would say that Ryan was stalking Hanks and there are laws against it. But if one is fated to be mated than those laws just don't apply.Hanks and Ryan strike just the right note as the fated couple and Hanks has some great scenes with young Malenger. Rosie O'Donnell has a nice bit in this as well as Ryan's equally romantic minded friend who kind of quarterbacks Ryan's moves. Sleepless In Seattle got two Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Song. Nora Ephron directed her own screenplay and the result is a magic romantic film like they used to do even in the high tech Nineties.

Sleepless in Seattle was engaging and mildly funny, and it achieved what I like all romance comedies to do make me wish the two main characters could be together. In this film, Tom Hanks and his son are mourning the death of his wife, and his son calls in on a radio show to find a new wife for his dad. Meg Ryan is listening from far away and starts falling in love with this man who she has never seen. It's a bit far-fetched, but we must remember that it is just a movie or we will never enjoy it. Sleepless had tons of potential, right up to the end, but did not prove itself to be a great romantic comedy. Tom Hanks' son is too much of a brat to be a lovable character, which takes away from some of the film's enjoyment. Also, without giving away the ending, it doesn't prove to be romantic enough. I was expecting the end to be more touching and satisfying instead of just suddenly ending on the spot like it does. The film is not necessarily all it's hyped up to be. Nevertheless, I won't complain too much. It's enjoyable and will entertain you for the evening. It also has a great soundtrack with singers like Jimmy Durante, Carly Simon, and Harry Connick Jr. I prefer You've Got Mail, also starring Hanks and Ryan, over this film because it's funnier and more romantic, but this is worth seeing.

Cupid is a butter-wouldn't-melt but irritatingly precocious 8 year old Jonah played competently by Ross Malinger. No-one is dangerous or offensive; it's very clean.

A year after losing his wife, he is struggling with the loss and to help him, his son Jonah phones a radio station to ask for advice, and Annie from Baltimore hears and knows she must meet up with Sam.Filled with plenty of romantic conventions, Nora Ephron's 1993 romantic drama creates a light hearted feel good film, with funny and dramatic moments for viewers of all ages.Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (When Harry met Sally), in their first collaboration, are perfect in their respective role, especially Ryan who is very funny, where as Hanks takes the more serious roles, which he is always perfect at.But the actor who steals the show is Ross Maligner, who is exceptional as Sam's son Jonah, a cheeky 8 year old kid who has plenty on his mind, and a temper and encouragement to match. His smart remarks about Victoria are pure genius, helped along by some classic facial expressions to make him the star of the film.Though completely unrealistic, this romantic drama generates a healthy plot with the ideology about finding the right person, which is enough to keep the mood alive. The difficulty in the character's lives is good to generate the concept of the right person, with Sam and his lost wife, and Annie and her bizarre fiancé.The lack of realism happens with a cheesy saying the same words, meeting at the same time, or just in time, an 8 year old girl hacking into a computer and an 8 year old kid getting on a plane all the way to New York.The lack of realism can take the edge of the plot, depending on how you look at it. For me, the humour and the likability of the characters was enough to let it slip.It is a very character driven film, helped along by the concept of finding the right person, to make an enjoyable and funny romantic drama.

This is pretty much a chick-flick, and I'm a guy, but I'm sorry, I rather liked it. Not profound or amazing or anything really all that special, just a well-done romance, where you really are pulling for the two to get together (despite realizing that, obviously, they're going to), and enjoy it when they finally do.There were two things in particular that I liked about it. One, they made the effort to try to establish some reasons to think these two actually belong together, as opposed to the more typical Hollywood deal of, well, they're right for each other because we say so, and here's the sentimental violin music to prove it.The other thing I liked is that the Walter character, the fiancé who's doomed to ultimately be the loser in this game of romance, is actually made out to be a half-decent guy. He's not made out to be an obvious putz that we know is all wrong for the woman, which would be the usual Hollywood thing to do (i.e. His Girl Friday or The Philadelphia Story (don't get me wrong, *great* movies, but you see my point)). Yeah, the whole excessive allergy thing is rather loserish, but other than that, he seems like a perfectly fine guy, who treats her well and really would try hard to make her happy, and in general she really does seem to respond to him and, at least on some level, be in love with him. Look at how happy she is, for instance, to get his valentine card. This all works very well, because it really does introduce a feeling of doubt in our minds... is she really going to leave him? I thought that was a very nice touch.So in the end, I enjoyed it.Although I'm left wondering at the end... they *still* haven't solved the problem that it's like 26 states between Seattle and Baltimore (as someone in a very-long-distance relationship, I can report first-hand that that kind of problem can be *very* hard to solve, true love or not), "},{"Title":"One of the Best","Date":"22 May 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is one of the best films about love and falling in love.

While Annie Reed (Meg Ryan)is coincedentially listening to the same radio station, the nosy host asks Jonah to put Sam on the phone and talk about his feelings. This show attracts Annie (along with 2,000 other love-seeking women) to find this man to whom she believes is her destiny (while she is engaged to Walter, played by Bill Pullman) so she is just sane enough to fly out to Seattle after she tracks down where he lives and his phone number, with the advice, guidance, clever dry humor and best friendship of Becky (Rosie O'Donnel), the kind of friend that deep down makes you crave for a friend like her because of her appeal in her character. With the extreme talent of Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Rosie O'Donnel and Victor Garber all in one bite, it is easier to swallow your meal whole. It is very rare to find the key ingredient in a good actor, precisely the reason Tom Hanks captivates the audienec so well.

I'd be grief stricken about her too.That out of the way, this movie handled the first part well, where Annie becomes infatuated with this man. She of course is in love not with him but with the relationship he had with his first wife.  The only problem here is that the story didn't give Sam a chance to develop more than a passing physical interest in Annie. This would nave added tremendous depth to the story and probably would have helped later on.The real problem with this movie is the opportunity missed in the final scene for an emotional reaction from Annie. Here she is on the top of the Empire State Building, knowing that she is WAY late. She finds Jonah's bag and... nothing happens. This was a great point for her to realize that he had been there, that it was actually the kid who wrote the letter, that HE wanted this relationship too, maybe more so than the adults. etc. This was the point for her to pour out a lot of pent up and newly formed emotions that would have counterbalanced the emotional buildup earlier on. (She would have had time to do that--the trip down and back up by the boys really would have taken a bit longer than it was portrayed.) Then, her reaction at coming face to face with Sam and Jonah would have been markedly different, more complex. We might have had some confirmation that that magic they were all three seeking actually did exist, especially if we had seen some of the afore-mentioned missing intrigue on the part of Sam. I would also have had her pull her original letter out of the knapsack, along with the teddy bear.So I feel that this was a very good movie, but it really missed an opportunity at the end which would have made it great.

Unrealistic? Perhaps, to a certain degree. Pristine in a time of over budgeted action flicks? This is certainly a feel good movie that we all still need. It has hope. It doesn't have a cynical outlook on life. Therefore, there's still hope for Hollywood. Not to churn out endless romantic comedies, but to make something they are having continual trivial complexes at trying to make. GOOD entertainment. To put the Sleepless in Seattle theory to the test, two years ago one of Sydney's prominent radio stations tried it out. People would speak to others over the phone, but would never see them. Lie detectors and psychics and other mad people were used to put together the couple best suited. Then the lavish wedding, the honey moon, and then the afterwards.The magic fell apart, months later. Oh dear. Maybe this is one situation where reel life is better than real life. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are both great in their roles of star matched lovers, and with the exception of a partially disturbing Rosie O'Donnell, the rest of the supporting cast matches up. I understand where the allegations of just another 'chick flick' but it certainly is a good 90s morale booster. It has all the right touches, light romance, light humour, light accompanying soundtrack and no over domineering actors. The whole thing fits together like a jigsaw puzzle.Despite how much I applaud the movie, Hanks and Ryan are no Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. An Affair to Remember references are the part basis of the movie, but it certainly enhances the whole thing. See it again. It's completely worth it.

Meg Ryan portrays a Baltimore newspaper writer who is engaged to a very dull Bill Pullman (as always, he nails the part), although she doesn't realize it and thinks she is in love.  I found it very endearing to watch Ryan, throughout the entire film, try to talk herself into believing that she and Pullman have a magical, romantic relationship even though they clearly don't.  En route to her parents' house on Christmas Eve, where she will introduce Pullman as her fiance, she overhears a young boy on the radio who has phoned into a talk show.  He is worried about his dad, a widower who can't seem to get over his grief.  Ryan hears Tom Hanks voice and falls in love, obsessing over meeting him in person.There are so many good performances in this film.  Rob Reiner as  Hanks' best friend, David Hyde Pierce as Ryan's brother, and especially Rita Wilson, Hanks real-life wife, who portrays his sister-in-law.  The scene where Wilson tearfully describes why a certain movie affects women is hysterical.  And Hanks' response to her is equally funny.The flaws  no one in any of the Baltimore scenes had a Baltimore accent, although they did work in Ryan's love of the Orioles which is realistic since most Baltimore women are obsessed with sports.  Rosie O'Donnell was AWFUL (yuck!) as Ryan's coworker friend--she was wooden and read her lines like a robot.  I can think of a dozen actresses who could have put life into this role, especially Laura SanGiacomo of tv's Just Shoot Me.  Also, the actors were all white--not a single black, Hispanic, Asian, etc. had a major role in the movie--why?Except for these last few notable annoyances, it would have been a perfect movie.

His mother died 18 months ago, and his Christmas wish is that his father will find a new wife so that he won't be so sad.

She doesn't know him at all. What if he had some freaky past? What if he doesn't like her? What if he is not there at all? Why break a perfectly good relationship with a person who truly loves you for some so-called magic that may just be a part of your imagination?

There is even one point when a very young Ron Howard runs away because his dad (Glen Ford) is dating and wants to marry a woman unacceptable to him. They've just lost their wife/mother unexpectedly (ring a bell?) When Glen Ford is reunited with his son, his line is very close, if not verbatim, to the line Tom Hanks uses in Sleepless - when he says something along the lines of what would I do if I didn't know where you were for an hour, day, or week (something along those lines). At any rate, Courtship is a great movie too. And while Sleepless references An Affair to Remember at some points, the plot and dialog follows very closely to Courtship.

I mean, you have one widower, deeply in love with his dead wife, being bullied by his psychotic son into finding a pair. He does so, in a so improbable manner, stumbling repeatedly onto neurotic Meg Ryan and finding the magic by just glancing at her.I think I liked the movie the first time I saw it, because I didn't read into it a lot. If you do, though, there are all these little marketing queues that make you sick after a while. You see, Meg Ryan's character is about to be married with a gentle and good hearted man. He has no obvious flaws. However, the script makes him allergic to a lot of things, snoring and a bit silly by being old fashioned. In the end, it's a normal thing for Ryan to leave him and for him to accept his fate gracefully, but is it really? The woman Tom Hank's character is dating has a silly laughter, so if the insane son of the man doesn't like her, it's OK to just ignore her feelings. At one time in the movie the boy shouts something about Mom never shouted at me and I thought and look where that got you.In conclusion, you can't be a real romantic movie fan (like I am not) and not watch this, but still, it's just a silly fantasy about how people should meet and never do.

This old classic signed Nora Ephron is a good example of everything that can go wrong. Built on the success of When Harry met Sally, we have cute heroine Meg Ryan playing one of her romantic leads roles, inclusive of tics and weirdness that were her trademark. She could easily be a slightly older version of Sally, with a worse haircut. This time, her character is called Annie and she lives in Baltimore.Annie is engaged to Walter, whose main defect is being dull. This must be a terrible crime in Ephron's book, since Walter is treated with zero respect. One night, Annie listens to Sam's phone call to a radio station. Sam is a young widower, living in Seattle with his son Jonah. Just listening to his story Annie fells for him.Many criticized this idea of falling in love, which however is not the worst point of the movie. People fall in love for lots of different reasons, so I could buy Annie falling for Sam and trying to meet him. What I do not buy is the artificiality of all the events presented after that.Annie is a journalist and manages to be sent to Seattle to meet Sam, but somehow manages not to do so, even if she sees him twice (and he sees her too, managing to fell in love at first sight). They do not exchange words, even if she could have waited for him and introduced herself in a normal way. But that would have been way too dull for Ephron.Then there is a letter which makes unbearable Jonah instantly like Annie. Jonah tries to push Sam to meet Annie on top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day. This is contrivance at the highest level, built in the script together with many references to the movie An affair to remember. Since neither Sam nor Annie live in New York, this romantic meeting on Valentine's is supposed to prove that love at first sight does exist and can even be the basis for a long lasting relationship&#x85;.. or whatever.What I got instead, is an overlong, unfunny movie where the two leads meet only at the end, which is certainly not the way I like on screen romances to go.

For the most part, I like this movie but for whatever reason I can't seem to bring myself to love it. It's somewhere between good and okay for me. I think it's to do with the idea of love this movie presents. It makes love to be somewhat of a fantasy (okay so that doesn't sound like a bad thing but stick with me for a moment). So Annie (portrayed by the lovely Meg Ryan) listens to the radio one day and hears a guy's story (said guy portrayed by Tom Hanks) about his wife dying and how he's been feeling lonely since then, unable to get back on his feet to start dating again. She begins to think that this guy sounds really sweet, she just can't stop thinking about him and it's evident that in her mind, she begins to play him up to be her Prince Charming. It's her perfect love, everything she wants, the only problem...she's never actually met the guy and I think this is where my problem stems from. You've probably heard of love being blind, well this movie plays with that idea and the idea of love at first sight...or sound/thought/whatever. Anyway, here's my fundamental issue with the movie and why I can't bring myself to love this movie. It deals with the idea of being in love in a movie which is actually mentioned in my favourite line of the movie you don't want to be in love, you want to be in love in a movie. How true those words are for a lot of people and even for me. The idea of that perfect person makes you fall for them because you picture them to be exactly what you want them to be and that's where my problem lies, because as much as I love the idea, it's not one I believe in. To me, love is about loving someone no matter what, accepting their flaws. Not everyone is perfect and although this movie recognises that, it's not something that is dealt with (and if it was and I missed it, then it wasn't in a way that was satisfactory to me since I didn't notice it). Sleepless in Seattle is about the idea that love is blind, it can happen at any moment, at any any time and with anyone. That's how I interpret it. However, it never explores anything beyond that. It's almost like a fairy tale and maybe that was the point of it, but for whatever reason I wasn't satisfied. It only looks at the idea of romance but never explores it since you never really get to see the two leads together properly. Yet for some reason, I find myself wanting the two leads to meet despite Meg Ryan's character feeling like a stalker and when they do meet, I'm disappointed because it ends without us ever seeing them together as a couple or even as friends for that matter. Is it a romantic movie? Yes, in fact it's very romantic since as I said, it plays on the idea of blind love but at the same time, the script is written in such a way that it makes me question everything and leaves me with an ambivalent feeling about the movie. I want to love it because the idea of love being blind is great but I can't because I don't believe in such a thing or at the very least, the movie wasn't executed in such a way that made me want to believe it. I strongly believe that true love, be it in a movie or in real life, is when two people know each other and without a shadow of a doubt, love them despite everything that might drive them crazy about the other.

Apparently, its story is based on the old 1957 classic, An Affair to Remember (starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr), which I confess to not having seen.The story revolves around a recent Seattle widower named Sam, whose son Jonah, seeing his dad's loneliness, advertises via talk show radio for a new wife for him (and mother for himself). Sam receives lots of letters in reply, including one from a certain Annie in Baltimore, despite the fact that she's already engaged to that strange character, Walter. Annie is so attracted and intrigued that she in fact travels to Seattle to check Sam (and his son) out, and so on... and so forth... culminating in a real humdinger of a finale involving NYC's Empire State Building.The lead roles are done to perfection with Tom Hanks (always so natural in every film) portraying the sympathetic, lonely widower, Sam, and Meg Ryan (queen of the romantic comedy) sparkling as the sweet, innocent, and wholesome Annie. I love both these stars anyway and they have great chemistry here. Okay, maybe it's not rocket science, maybe it's corny and unlikely, but it's a really cute movie. Get into your jamies, girls, make some popcorn, and enjoy. By the way, the guys just might like it, too. My own husband really did.

The incredibly romantic ending and musical score help to make this movie a truly enjoyable romantic comedy to view.This is tons better then Hanks and Ryan's later effort, You've Got Mail, which I think, tried to hard. Sleepless is in the same category as a movie like pretty Woman, in that, while many elements are unrealistic, it manages to stay completely delightful all the same and anything that maybe over the top can be overlooked because of the movie's sweetness.

In Baltimore, Annie (Meg Ryan) is listening to the show and starts to wonder if Sam is the one for her, despite appearing happily engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman) moments before she listens to the show.It's an enjoyable film, I'll probably watch it again one day. However, I expected it to be better after hearing other people's comments. It seemed slightly unfinished. Hanks and Ryan are a great on screen couple, as You've Got Mail proved, but they are barely in a scene together in this movie. It would have been more convincing if we had seen more of Sam and Annie together at the end, to see if her feelings about him were correct and to see how he felt about her. I'm not expecting the writers to let us know if they ended up married or anything, just an indication about how they got on when they first meet.It is different from most romantic comedies, there is no kissing or sex scenes (which is refreshing) and the couple don't meet until the end.Rating - 7/10.

I swear that you can always find either this film or The American President on at least one of the basic cable channels at any given time! The film was a huge hit for all involved, and this is a fact that may be a bit troubling.The film deals with Tom Hanks who has just lost his wife moving to Seattle with his young son to start a new life. Why Seattle? Well, this film was made in the early 1990s. Seatte was the trendy place to be back then with its grunge music, coffee houses, flannel shirts and computer companies. Why Hanks & son even move into a trendy kind of hybrid house/boat that they likely would not have been able to afford unless his wife had a nice insurance policy. At least (as far as I recall) the film spares us with the typical Seattle scene of someone throwing fish to another person at that famous outdoor market. Who knows, maybe they threw a shot of this in there. I don't know if I've ever seen this film completely from start to finish.Anyway, Hanks's son really wants a new mommy for himself and a new wife for his daddy. So he calls up one of those boring national shrink radio shows that nearly sunk AM radio back then before the conservative radio revolution saved it. The kid basically tells his plight to the whole country, and Meg Ryan hears him while driving. She is instantly touched by the kid's plea, and sets out to learn as much as she can about Hanks and the kid with the help of computers, private eyes, you name it. Of course the trouble is, Ryan is already engaged to another man. And this man (Bill Pullman) is one of many annoyingly stereotypical supporting characters. He is written as a meek, and boring individual who suffers from some very exaggerated allergy symptoms which are supposed to be funny. As one who has suffered with allergies of his own, I must inform you dear reader that there is nothing funny about these conditions. Will Meg and Tom end up together???? I wonder.The ridiculous scenes and annoying characters are many in number. The kid who plays Hanks's boy is really annoying. So is his little girlfriend. For a while, Hanks dates a woman whose only character trait of note is that she laughs like a hyena. Other than that, she really doesn't seem that bad, but of course the kid hates her. Oh, and Rosie O'Donnell is in the film. Enough said on that issue. The film isn't a complete loss. Of course most women will love it, and the acting by Hanks and Ryan is pretty good. Ryan was still a hottie back then, before some very cruel plastic surgeon turned her face into something resembling The Joker.Overall, this just isn't my kind of thing. Remember I'm the guy who recently gave 10 stars to Revenge of the Ninja! For those of you whose hearts flutter as Jimmy Durante takes you out into the credits, picture this scenario.... Maybe Hanks, Ryan and the boy go out for a bite to eat after their rooftop rendezvous. And after an hour or so of talking, they decide they really don't like each other that much. Something to ponder...... 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.

When Hanks's annoying child (and he is extremely annoying) catches the flight from Seattle to New York, Hanks finds out and chases. As we are shown that the flight hasn't arrived at NYC when Hanks sets off (as shown in the dashed line illustrative cut), logic would dictate that Hanks would phone the airport ahead, to make sure that the kid was picked up (probably by the police) when the plane landed. In fact, the cabin crew would be alerted and be ready for the police on landing. There is no way that Hanks as a responsible parent wouldn't do this, as who would want their 6 year old child walking around NYC by himself?It's quite a fun film, but it's not a 10/10. The director keeps trying to make excuses for why the film isn't a great movie, by insinuating that it's a chick flick, therefore fellas won't get it (by creating the analogy with An Affair to Remember), thus invoking a sense of feminist camaraderie about the movie, which in turn possibly makes women want to like the movie more in the spirit of all things feminine. Unfortunately, that doesn't wash, as there are some fantastic rom coms and romance movies out there.

However if the comedy bit works well then I'll happily accept any slush or mush that comes with it however unlikely it is.  This film almost made it for me but with a few misgivings.  The plot is wholly unlikely and is slightly based around An Affair to Remember and is pretty unlikely to have ever occurred in the real world.  However it is done with just enough wit and life to it that it doesn't just become a weepy until late on in the film.  It's not consistently funny but it does just about have enough going on to support the unlikely romance.This is in part due to the support characters in place.  You've Got Mail failed for me cause it put the film heavily on Hanks and Ryan.  Here the same is pretty true but it also has good names in support who may only deliver a few lines but do enough to life the film.  O'Donnell may be awful but she is OK here, while Pierce, Reiner and a few others add the odd jape here and there.  Hanks is too worthy for the role but happily does have some great scenes where he is able to aspire back to his goofier roles.  Ryan is good for the role but personally I can't stand one inch of her sappy face.  Pullman is wasted and is deliberately left on the side to try and not have us feel sorry for him and Malinger is just good enough to avoid being a `cute kid' role.Overall this is essentially a date movie or just for girls but there is enough in it to make it more than that.  It is unlikely and slushy but the script is funny and if you can cope with a thick slice of mush then there is enough here to stop it becoming just sickly sweet.

She didn't put much effort into it; which exposed it as just absurd coincidence, not fate. Her fantasy didn't possess more details and a coherent inner- logic, even as a fantasy, to hit the mark. So without much approach, smarter coincidences, or even less coincidences; the whole thing looked not as love at first sight, inasmuch as love at sights !!!Look at the climax, you wouldn't know if this love story could continue or not, originally work or not, because the drama sunk foolishly in its dream and the hasty desire to fulfill it anyway. And regardless of (Ryan)'s fiancé as allergic person being mocked at (which got on my nerves badly since I'm one !), I couldn't stand the sudden, very easy, change of him at the end. But driven by the desire to present, even forcedly, a wow finish or extremely happy ending, it attained being fabricated ! Hence while that climax seems as a nice fun, it satisfies itself with what it says more than satisfying us; which makes you feel that this is the ultimate basket case movie !So, why not to witness, for instance, the 2 leads talking or dealing ? Ahh, because it would ruin the fantasy ! If you think that reality could include it, then Amen.. You're a believer, and no more sleepless. Yet, it can't deny how the movie reports that to us in kind of sleepy way ! The movie as a romantic comedy wasn't that romantic or that comic. It wasn't enough to hire (Tom Hanks) and (Meg Ryan) to feel the comedy. Even the light moments, the funny lines, were so few. And lacking comedy as the accurate logic for great random accidents (or what seem so) of which the movie deals with&#x97;eventually weakened the romantic part too.As for the positive points  let's admit that it somehow has a different plot. Watching inevitable lovers-to-be before their first actual meeting was amusing. The movie stands alone in propagating how life is open to far experiences. (Hanks) and (Ryan) were sweet, even if separately. It deals with old movies as holy, which's a rare nostalgia to find in a movie for another. And hands down, the scene of (Hanks) and (Victor Garber) crying over The Dirty Dozen (1967) was the best. You can connect between its fact as completely improvised during the take and (Ephron)'s not too fine ability in writing comedy ! The movie indirectly tells you a lot about cruel world; where dreams are from movies, by movies, through movies. It's a case of a movie that lost any faith in reality to have faith in reality's magical area, looking forward to the exceptional right thing to happen. Of course life has more fantasy movies than you can imagine. It's the origin of all the imagination in the first place. However, I think (SIS) is one of the worst movies to assure that, despite its well meaning. Also it says something about how we must let the hearts, not the minds, lead the way whatever haphazard, absurd, and visionary that would sound or could be. Though, it encourages believing in that and pays no attention to making it believable (because love is unbelievable.. Got it ?!). This is not romance; this is very cinematic romance which ends up as just implied love letter for the old Hollywood, and the dream in us.It works like a smooth bubble. And if it spreads the message of go for your dream so it succeeds, but less effective and so artificial compared to any movie it pays homage to. Sorry, as a love story, this is so naive. However, that could be perfectly its basic purpose  Love is naive !

Sleepless in Seattle for instance hasn't got all that much special to offer, but still it was nominated for many awards. Sure, it was a romantic comedy in a time not that many had been made before. It was something new, romance always sells and there were some very likable actors to be seen in it, but they didn't even get a nomination. No, the Oscar nomination was for the music and the script...The movie starts with showing us Sam Baldwin who has been recently widowed, who now lives in Seatlle, together with his 8-year old son Jonah and who is convinced that he will never be able to love again. But that's not what his son thinks. Jonah thinks that his father needs a woman in order to get his life back in order and calls in on a nation-wide radio-show. The story of Sam is heard by hundreds of women, including Annie Reed, who is about to marry her fiancé Walter. But she can't forget about Sam and wants to know for sure that he wouldn't be the one for her. She travels from Baltimore to Seattle and decides that Sam isn't the one. But the letter that she wrote for him, but never posted, is posted by one of her friends. Jonah who is convinced that Annie is the best option, arranges a meeting on top of the Empire State Building and books a flight for his dad without telling him...When a script is nominated for an Oscar, you certainly can expect some fireworks from it. At least, that's what I hope for and that's exactly what I didn't get from this movie. It tries a bit too hard to work on the people's sentiments (being lonely on Christmas time, romantic appointments on a special location,...). It all was a bit too much from time to time. On the other hand I must also say that there was some fine humor to be seen in it as well. Especially when they were talking about other movies, I had some very good laughs. For instance the scenes where they talk about The Dirty Dozen and Fatal Attraction were excellent. But overall that just isn't enough to save the entire story. What I liked better was the acting. Even though not always very stunning, I certainly enjoyed Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.Overall this is a movie that will be loved most by the people who are big fans of romantic comedies. I'm not one of them, although I can certainly enjoy some of them, especially when they are full of some fine humor. But a movie that makes fun of romantic movies (when someone says 'A movie! That's your problem! You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie') and than ends up in the same trap that they are making fun of, isn't exactly my idea of a great movie. That's also the reason why I give it a score between 6/10 and 6.5/10.

Sam (Tom Hanks) is a single dad who just lost his wife Maggie (Carey Lowell) died in cancer. He and his son Jonah (Ross Malinger) move to Seattle for a change of scenery, but find that the void in their lives left by Maggie is more painful than ever. On Christmas Eve, Jonah calls a national radio psychology show and hopes that the doctor will help his Dad conquer his loneliness. Thousands of women across the country hear Sam's moving story of love and loss, and are touched head over heels. One woman tuned in is Baltimore journalist Annie (Meg Ryan), who is about to marry the most boring, pathetic soul on the planet (Bill Pullman), and is having a hard time to face the fact that she's going to make a mistake. After much deliberation, Annie feels that hearing about Sam on the radio was fate giving her a sign, and she decides to meet Sam to find out if he is her destiny. Only time will tell if Sam and Annie are M.F.E.O. (Made For Each Other). Sleepless in Seattle contains a perfect blend of romance and comedy, it allows the romantics to believe that love still can heal the broken-heart, create hope and fulfill dreams in an age of disillusionment and despair. Sleepless In Seattle embellishes this fundamental truth. It is a subtle reminder that no matter how desperate our situation may be and regardless how painful it becomes to us, love conquers all.

It's on the bland side, hokey at times and syrupy with sentiment. Sometimes we need that. I save my ratings of 8, 9, and 10 for movies that transcend a pleasing story line and a happy ending. (Movies don't need sentiment or a happy ending, and can have unsettling elements of plot and get higher ratings from me).The movie is soap-opera material, but at least it moves quickly enough. It poses no questions and answers none beyond the question, can people love others despite distance? Sure. So what? I give a generous 7 on the grounds that people who want syrupy wish-fulfillment are going to find this movie satisfying, probably near the best among its type.

Well firstly two first class actors. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  The storyline is such that they keep missing each other but getting occasional glimpses of one another.  All the time I was willing them to meet even though it might shorten the movie.  Without Jonah (Ross Malinger) the movie would be doomed to failure since Hanks is no lady pursuer, but Jonah, helped by his little girlfriend mini travel agent make sure of success.If you are looking for reality, this movie is not for you but if you want a lovely story with a happy ending it is lovely.

The idea of the story was okay, but not very intriguing, taking the idea of Love Affair but not expanding on it very well. I also severely disliked how every female character was so weepy over the movie, Love Affair. Meg Ryan's character cried, Rosie O'Donnell's character cried, as well as several other women throughout the movie, leaving the male character's to watch stoically and roll their eyes. Even when Meg Ryan's character asks a security guard if he's watched Love Affair, he comments Yeah, my wife loves that movie.I found that kind of annoying, it was a running theme throughout the entire film that women are the only ones to cry over such a touching story; even a 10-year-old girl cries over it. It's okay to show women crying over a film, but when the only women you show fit this description, it starts to be inaccurate, portraying only an annoying stereotype. I didn't cry after seeing Love Affair, neither did any other women I know. This stereotype is even worse when you see every male character in this movie laughing at how the women are acting, it's like oh, that's just how chicks are, crying over a silly movie. Sleepless in Seattle was a nice little story, but left me bothered by how it portrayed women.

Basically Sam Baldwin (Golden Globe nominated Tom Hanks) is interviewed for radio, and one listener is intrigued by his words, Annie Reed (Golden Globe nominated Meg Ryan) hears him say I'm sleepless in Seattle, and she obviously now wishes she could meet him. When opportunity comes she almost takes it, but soon changes her mind, but don't worry, towards the end they both go for it and meet each other and fall in love. Also starring Bill Pullman as the allergic-to-everything Walter, Rosie O'Donnell as Becky, Carey Lowell as Maggie Abbott Baldwin and director Rob Reiner as Jay. If you have seen An Affair to Remember you may know some of what happens, and you are probably right. Hanks and Ryan worked together before in Joe vs. the Volcano, and again after in You've Got Mail. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for A Wink and a Smile and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Marc Shaiman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Meg Ryan was number 75, and Tom Hanks number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Good!

So I don't believe love at first sightor even if  love at first hearing.It could cheat you.I believe in love based on mutual understanding.Of course,Annie tries to find out what happen to her.Doesn't she really love her boyfriend,while easily falls in love with another man,and they even don't know with each other.Annie attempts to contact Sam and even sets out on a cross-country trip to meet him.Sam isn't interested in meeting anyone.But when he see Annie for the first time, he feels something that can't be express in word.It is incredible! Additionally, without Jonah's help,Annie and Sam could go together? Who knows.So in one cases,love at first sight maybe lead to happy marriages. In fact,love based on mutual understanding will lead to more happier marriages.Because of mutual understanding with each other, two parties wouldn't regret easily one day.Anyway, Sleepless in Seattle is a hight romantic comedy.People like to see such films.In our life, maybe there appears phenomenon like this.The director catch some aspects from life to perform them.

This obvious aspect of the film, sticks out like a sore thumb, to such a point, that it makes it unbearable to watch. I had to grin and bear it with my wife, who had enjoyed it. She had a different opinion. I could see that this film was attempting to appeal to the romantic nature in us, at the expense of delving entirely into a dangerous fantasy.It sets up an unrealistic view of reality, I suppose like many romantic films. But this one is the worst I have seen, because it comes too close to the truth, in a misleading way. Don't get me wrong, I am a romantic. I enjoy the Twilight series as well as Disney films, among many others. These are fantasy, but so clearly fantasy that one can truly escape reality, which is, I think the primary reason people enjoy films.With certainty Meg Ryan's character will not be happy with her next relationship. Studies prove this. There is always magic at the beginning of every relationship. I can predict that in several years that the magic will leave the next relationship. The flaw is in her, not in Bill Pullman's character, who is a good man.In summation, I perceived the movie as watching two foolish people, making the obvious blunder of thinking the next relationship will make them happy. Now, if that's how it was meant to be perceived, I would have given it a very high rating.

I saw it the first time about 8 years ago, when I was still a kid. I liked the movie then. After re-watching it now, I was somewhat disappointed. I think they should have made it less comedy and more drama. The acting was good, but I'm more the drama kind of guy. If they would have made something more serious, I would have loved it more.So in the end, is it worth watching. Yes, absolutely.
