No, not by the title - but how did we not hear about this movie? I'll say upfront, I'm not a Branagh fan, but I do love Robin Wright Penn. But Branagh blew me away with this performance - he's finally been given a great script by someone other than Shakespeare and run with it. The writing is smart and funny, the supporting cast is just terrific, especially the girl playing Amy. When I checked here, I saw the writer/director is the same guy who wrote Private Parts, one of my favorite films.If I try and put my finger on what touched me the most in this movie, I guess it's that the people were all so real and so I ended up caring very much what happened to them all. I'd love a sequel to see what happens to them after this episode in their lives!Who should see this film Everyone who likes smart, funny writing and acting told in an adult way; and anyone who likes something other than the typical Hollywood blockbuster.

From the very first minutes of the movie, you know that you are in for something special. As always, his timing when delivering a humorous line and his adroit methods of playing off a co-star, are in full force here. Robin Wright does an excellent job as his usually ignored wife, and the remainder of the cast, as you will see, was well directed.The real standout in this film is the dialogue. The writing is superb...so much so, that I am going to watch it again, to pick up the lines I missed while I was either laughing or savoring an exquisite film moment.He is totally in charge of the role given him here and really does hate the neighbor's dog ( as you would too), but the dog is only a segment of what is a bigger picture of a man fighting his personal torments, and all the while, doing it with a smile.Why there wasn't more publicity about this film is beyond me. If it is to become a cult classic, then so be it, but it will definitely become some kind of classic.  I have written other comments on this site for movies, and consider myself an excellent judge of what entertains and what does not, no matter who is in it, and I heartily recommend that you get a glass of your favorite whatever, and sit back and watch a great movie unfold. I would suggest that you are older than thirty to REALLY have fun with this vehicle.Oh yes, let the credits role after the movie ends....in a few moments there is a scene that you WILL need to see.

The story is set in Los Angeles. A British-American play-writer goes through a mid-life, mid-career, mid-relationship crisis. He is happily married, but the couple is childless, mostly probably because he is a champion of egocentrism and does not seem to like children very much. All this changes when a neighbor with an eight-year old daughter moves in. You have indeed seen the story in many other movies, but the masterful acting of Branagh with good support from the rest of the team, the sarcastic description of the content-empty life in the artistic circles in Los Angeles, and the witty relationship between the European roots of the character and his Americanized life make the film both interesting to watch, as well as true in message. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.

The most obvious of these is the symmetry of the neighbor's cur (dog) who dies, and Peter's curmudgeon (who also dies). This kind of play is deftly introduced in dialog between the two Peters, comically peppered by Branagh saying `I got nothing out of that,' after a fusilade from the other.-- All supported by good actors. In this case our top Shakespearean, and the wife of our top film actor.

"},{"Title":"There are Rewards to be Found Beyond the Title","Date":"8 September 2002","Score":"10 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  First of all, the biggest obstacle to enjoying and appreciating this movie is the fact that the title alone is going to keep it out of most people's hands.  Let's face it, when the average, discerning viewer browsing the local video store shelves comes across one called `How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog,' it immediately gets mentally shuffled into the mindbox right alongside such obtuse fare as the consummately repugnant and forgettable `Surf Nazis Must Die,' (which, by the way, is a title I never thought would issue forth from my fingertips for any reason whatsoever, but it happens to work here) or the likes.  I mean, slapping on such a designation is like insisting on a strike three call with the first pitch when you're the batter.  Then again, there's that old saying about judging a film by it's cover.  Take `Office Space,' for example; who in a million years would have expected something as entertaining and insightful from Mike Judge, the guy who gave the world Beavis and Butthead, for crying out loud?  (Still, in retrospect, Beavis and Butthead wasn't half bad...).  The point is, writer/director Michael Kalesniko did himself a major disservice with his title, which may have been a shock value attempt to grab some attention that didn't really work out.  But if you can overcome what for most will surely be an entirely understandable prejudice against this one, you'll be in for a treat.  And in the final analysis, it points up the wisdom of not dismissing any movie out-of-hand.Hollywood denizen Peter McGowan (Kenneth Branagh) is a successful playwright, but in the show biz tradition of `what have you done for me lately?' he is having trouble getting his latest play off to a running start.  Rehearsals have begun, but even director Brian Sellars (David Krumholtz) can't seem to find the magic.  And poor Peter is experiencing a heavy hit of writer's block that is preventing him from fixing it, and working out of his home doesn't seem to be the answer.  Wife Melanie (Robin Wright Penn) is supportive, but they have no children of their own, and pursuant of her natural motherly instincts, she has taken on eight-year-old Amy Walsh (Suzi Hofrichter), daughter of new neighbor and single mom Trina (Lucinda Jenney), to babysit.  In addition to which there is a `False Peter' (Jared Harris) roaming about the neighborhood, a fan, apparently, who has taken on Peter's identity, and to top it all off, the neighbor's dog just will not quit barking.  Suffice to say Peter is not seeing the world through rose colored glasses these days, but there has to be an answer to his many and myriad dilemmas; now all he has to do is find it.Perhaps sabotaging his own film with a title that instantly relegated it to `cult' status was Kalesniko's way of getting into his alter-ego's skin and exploring Peter's conundrum and his possible reactions.  And if such was the case, it worked.  Because once you give this film a chance, you'll find that it's funny, poignant and actually filled with some pretty astute insights into and observations of the human condition.  This is a black comedy/drama, to be sure, but at the heart of the film there is a dramatic story that will evoke no small amount of empathy and compassion from the audience.  Which is to say, with this film you get so much more than what you bargained for; it is decidedly NOT what you're expecting based on the title alone.  There are a couple of instances in which Kalesniko succumbs to a bit of unnecessary low-brow humor, but it's not enough to detract from the whole.  In the end, this film dips deeply into the pockets of human nature to extract the kind of sentiments (without being sentimental) rarely found in a film of this genre, and it makes a positive and lasting impression.The role of a transplanted Brit insomniac playwright with writer's block must have seemed like a character out of a dream for Kenneth Branagh, who totally immerses himself in Peter and comes up with a winning and memorable portrayal.  The character was obviously well written to begin with, but Branagh takes hold of the part and runs with it, making it entirely his own by lending the kind of depth and nuance to it that really brings Peter to life.  The development of the character is effected extremely well, too, as initially, Peter is a guy who is not necessarily likable, with quirks and peccadilloes aplenty.  But as the story progresses, so does Peter, and there's some tender moments along the way that are quite unexpected, given the attitude and bearing Peter starts out with.  And it's the way Branagh brings his character around that makes it work; it evolves rather than coming from a sudden left turn out of nowhere.  Peter finally has a `breakthrough,' and it comes from a place that is completely unanticipated.  It's a solid performance, and one of the rewards that comes from successfully navigating past Kalesniko's questionable title.Robin Wright Penn is also impressive in her role as Melanie, though it's not too much of a stretch for her artistically.  But it's one of those straightforward `normal' characters that seem so easy to play they are often taken for granted (Easy?  Let he among you who has acted in front of a camera without once looking at it cast the first stone).  The real find here, however, is the young Hofrichter, who is endearing and totally effective as Amy, a young girl with her own challenges to overcome.The supporting cast includes Lynn Redgrave (Edna), Peter Riegert (Larry), Johnathon Schaech (Adam), Derek Kellock (Amy's Father) and Peri Gilpin (Debra).  Happening upon this film is like ordering a hamburger and being served filet mignon for the same price; and it makes `How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog' a thoroughly satisfying and fulfilling cinematic experience.  Give it a try.  8/10.              "},{"Title":"Looking for a wonderful, under-the-radar movie?

I had to talk a friend into seeing it, and we knew nothing about it.  We were not disappointed at all.  It takes a little while to get rolling, but once it does, the dialogue is wittier than anything Hollywood will ever churn out.  It is refreshing to see a movie that doesn't play to the lowest common denominator. The acting was perfectly executed, and the writing was some of the best this year.  Robin Wright-Penn was at her best, especially in an emotionally intense argument between her and Brannagh over remarks he made to the neighbor.  And Brannagh was definitely in his element here, with some wonderfully razor-sharp dialogue that he executed perfectly. There was a handicapped child that was a bit contrived and predictable, but she was a wonderful actor and her role in the plot kept it from being trite. You just don't see writing this good in Hollywood.  That fact would just boil inside you as you watch this and realize that it will never get a wide theatrical release.  That is until an hysterical interview of the author (Brannagh) unfolds throughout the film.  The comments he makes to the interviewer (Ros from Frasier) make light of Hollywood's blindness to anything that is not ignorant drivel and send you from the theater with a great feeling that all hope is not lost.  You may have to look around, but you can still find an intelligent movie.  And this is one of them.

It's a pleasure to be reminded of what a versatile and accomplished actor he is in non-Shakespearean roles.  The main plot of the movie, which involves Peter's reluctance to have children, and his growing relationship with a neighbor child, flirts with sentimentality, but avoids it thanks to the sharp writing and performances.

Nor did he make me think, this is going to be a funny movie. I assumed it would be a story about something he did, rather than a story about what happened to him, and hence I wasn't much interested. His glib remarks about this and that I found only mildly amusing, and no signals were being sent about say murder, a terrorist bomb, a sexual conflict, or anything else that spoke PLOT. I was thinking, this is some indie drivel where we're supposed to be amused by this guy's sour view of life -- and that's it. (Speaking of which, at one point the protagonist's wife compares him to Andy Rooney.) Unfortunately the title contributes to this misunderstanding by suggesting a cynical comedy about how this guy overcomes the people (or animals) around him. HOWEVER ... about 30 minutes in I began to realize that what I disliked about the main character *is* the plot, the story problem, and at that point I started to get it. Why isn't this film more popular? It's not so much a problem with the film, which is true to itself, but with audience expectations. Those of us who feed regularly at the mainstream trough don't necessarily expect such subtle (though universal) issues are going to be the point. It's like Charlie Rose when you're used to Crossfire. And of course there's no sex, or violence, or special effects -- with one exception (see title) -- anyway nothing that would catch your eye on a movie poster. Spielberg's AI makes a good contrast; on a similar topic, it has all the eye-popping glitz possible (if you have $100 million or so), but storywize it's simplistic and unfocused. This has a great story and nothing more -- but guess what, that's enough.

Another issue is the McGowan's differences of opinion on having children and how their growth in their relationship and themselves affects this.

This film is intelligent and heartfelt at the same time, on a level that almost no other film I have ever seen manages to reach.It's disconcerting to see how many critics (the ones whose reviews are on R----- T-------) just missed it completely, how this movie went over their heads.The interactions between virtually all the characters are masterfully rendered, but the relationship between Peter and the neighbor's handicapped girl is outstanding and beautiful. The scene when he sits with her at her toy tea table, ostensibly to do research for his play, and lets her teach him how to play, is unbelievably touching and funny.I had to watch it again, after reading lukewarm reviews by certain critics I usually respect, to convince myself that they had a blind spot and in the last analysis, I am the critic I need to rely on.But if my words encourage anyone else to see this, anyone who might also discover a real gem in this movie, then by all means, let them have their effect!

I'm amazed to see how poorly it did at the box office. I blame the title. It was funny, heartwarming, sweet and meaningful. As always Kenneth Branagh was terrific in a tricky like him/hate him role. Robin Wright was great as his wife, in a struggle with the husband she loves about whether or not to have a baby. And why hasn't Suzi Hofrichter (who played Amy, the young neighbor girl) become a big star? She stole the scenes with Branagh-not easy to do. Of course, Lynn Redgrave can do no wrong-a moving though subtle performance. Even the periodic music (loved hearing the old Petula Clark songs) was fun. I wish it could be redistributed with a new title and promoted properly. Until I happened upon it on a cable channel I had never heard of it. I highly recommend this movie to all except younger children (due to language and some medical scenes-not gory or anything, but personal).

Kenneth Branagh, a truly remarkable actor, was perfectly cast as the writer, playwright and not so wanting to be a father to be.Branagh had me laughing and crying.... Amy was a great character for a child, and a great little actress. As annoying as she could have been, she wasn't, but rather endearing in the life of her two neighbors. Krumholtz was annoying, the only one.This is a movie that I would recommend to fans of Branagh as a gem! He was great (and buffed) in Frankenstein, and more curmudgeonly in this one - as Pete told him. Nevertheless, he came across as the real deal and made me wonder why he doesn't have kids yet!! Why not Kenneth? You'd be a great father. Is he a mirror of his character? "},{"Title":"Quirky comedy that tugs the heartstrings near the end.","Date":"19 December 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  some SPOILERS containedHow to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog is a low-budget independent film that had its largest audiences at various film festivals. Branaugh and Penn give fine performances. He is the jaded writer who had greater success a few years back and seems to be looking for a muse. Penn is his steady, understanding wife and she plays it perfectly. He is writing a play and the film cuts to rehearsals now and then, and it is clear that the muse is still lurking but not present.Things change when a small girl with a bad leg moves in next door with her single mother. At first Branaugh wants nothing to do with her, as he has thus far also avoided fatherhood. But the little girl grows on him, through her he learns how children really express themselves, his writing improves, she has become not only his muse but also shows him the joy of sharing your life with a child. The overprotective mother takes her child away when she thinks the dance Penn taught her was too strenuous, the mother and father reconcile, it is a sad scene when the little girl must leave. There is a side story, a vagrant aspiring writer stalks then befriends Branaugh, he and Penn hear a shot at night, go out to find a dead dog in their yard.DVD is very basic, no extras, no surround sound, but adequate. Not a great film but nonetheless very entertaining, my wife and I thought. Robin Wright Penn has become one of the better, understated female actors of modern times.

The only thing I found remotely funny was the interview that is going on the whole time.  The acting was wonderful.  Branagh was excellent and I can't wait for him to do another Shakespearian play.  Also Robin Wright Penn did a great job with her part.  I thought the movie moved a little slow.  The way the mother of the child acted is probably the way most parents of children with disabilities act.  I still believe the mother got what she deserved.This was a film that could have done so much better.  If I was wanting to watch a drama at the time I probably would have liked this film more.

How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog, however, is a straight comedy, and it's laugh-out-loud funny and intellectual without being too arty.Kenneth Branagh is great as usual, but the film isn't of the powerful and elite theatrical stuff he normally does. It's rather like Dead Again, in being typical Hollywood with a few interesting twists and some very clever lines and interactions. There film has something to say, sort-of, but it's not especially deep, and I'm sure I totally missed lots of in-jokes for theater performers.The only negative comments I'd make (a) the film involves a disease, whose symptoms I entirely failed to pick up on (b) was it just a bad videocassette I rented, or is the sound quality awful?Who should see this film-- theater actors, writers, stagehands-- comedy lovers who aren't expecting any action or romance-- action buffs when your spouse tries to get you towatch a romantic comedy, make an attempt to switch to this oneI rate How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog a 7 out of 10.

Story is about a Los Angeles playwright that is in production with his new play and is having a terrible time with re-writes. Kenneth Branagh plays Peter McGowan and along with his play he and his wife Melanie (Robin Wright Penn) are trying to conceive a child and he is having difficulty with that also. Peter chain smokes and is not to crazy about kids but he is introduced to his new neighbors daughter Amy (Suzi Hofrichter) who has cerebral palsy. Melanie's mother Edna (Lynn Redgrave) is suffering from advanced senility and lives with them and Peter is having a difficult time concentrating on his play. And he also has a difficult time sleeping at night because his neighbors dog keeps barking so Peter goes for midnight walks and meets a man from England (Jared Harris) that has been telling everyone that he is Peter McGowan when in fact he's just an obsessed fan. This film is directed by Michael Kalesniko who wrote the screenplay for Private Parts and he displays a knack for showing the struggles of a writer but aside from that this is a film that meanders until it eventually wears itself out. Redgrave seems completely wasted as the senile mother of Penn. She has one effective scene with Branagh as she lies in bed but other than that her role is relegated to wandering about their home in a trance. Penn plays her role rather straight forward but she displays real charm that I think she's never really shown before on screen. Not a complicated part but she gives it her all. The film starts out with showing all of Peters quirks and difficulties but once that is done the film wanders and meanders until its reduced to Peter getting very sentimental over his neighbor Amy. Branagh is believable as a writer but all the events that go on around him are not.

An excellent cast, intelligent dialogue, nice ending and all over well-made doesn't help, as Mr Kalesniko have had editing problems with his own script - he has forgotten the golden writing rule of killing your own darlings.Evidently the director/writer Kalesniko feels that writing is hard, and frustrating, therefore a large part of the film is about the lead character (well played by Branagh) having problems writing his latest play, which maybe could be interesting for his (Kalesniko's) friends and family, but certainly of little importance to the general public. It is old ground which has been covered before, numerous times, and better, to boot.If the film was re-edited I think it could be a smashing hit, if it concentrated on the lead character's family life, and his neighbours (including the excellent dog), and not so much on this stage production that never really takes off. It is neither funny enough, nor moving enough, even if the role of the theater's janitor (played with such bravado by Brett Rickaby) is a premium class gem. That the play's director flips every other scene and starts to sing instead of directing is weird, that's all!Other first class acts are Suzy Hofrichter as the young Amy, and Lynn Redgrave as the demented mother, and Jared Harris as Branagh's doppelganger. Robin Wright Penn plays the role of Branagh's wife with confidence, while I have seen better performance from Branagh. So I'm looking forward to Michael Kalesniko's next film, and hope he re-releases this one, in a shorter, better, version.I'll give it a 9 for the acting, 9 for the dialogue, but 3 for the editing (tempo, majestro, tempo!) and a 4 for the over-all impression!So, in conclusion a 5/10, so not good, but promising!

The movie teaches a lot such as the root for not a thing is nothing and many others. The lead character is not at all shy and hates everything and everyone except his wife and Amy. Sometimes I think though that Ms. Wright-Penn is going to burst a vein in her neck from arguing with him. After a half hour you get tired of listening to him belly-ache and just want him to start being more like his mother in law! Which is quiet. It is chuck full of quick witted material though. But it doesn't deserve 3 stars from TV Guide when movies such as The Break-Up only rates 2. Are you kidding me, TV Guide rating people? Just because an actor has an accent doesn't mean he deserves a 3 star rating.

It too has a bunch of too-cool-for-the-room humor that you will only get if you are very smart and very clever.Don't get me wrong, there are good things about this movie, but they barely make it watchable start-to-finish.  Branaugh, Hofrichter, and Harris all deliver spectacular performances and there scenes together prove to be the glue that holds this thing together.Of all the things in this film I didn't enjoy I will focus solely of the putrid performance of David Krumholtz, as the flamboyantly gay director, Brian Sellars.  It is, simply put, the most two-dimentional, stereotypical, and offensively poor depiction of a homosexual I have ever seen on film. Seriously folks, it is painful to watch, and Krumholtz ought to be blacklisted for it.

The entire movie I tried to figure out what does the title have to do with the actual movie. The neighbor's dog appears late in the movie and the worst part about it is that the main character isn't even trying to kill the dog, the movie's plot has absolutely nothing to do with the killing of that dog. The movie is about the way some guy feels about how he's life would be if he had a child. It was a total waist of my time. "}]
