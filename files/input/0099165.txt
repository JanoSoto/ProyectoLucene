The superb directing, creating realistic and horrible scenes of dirty political games and black (literally) PR, capture my attention. So, to sum up, a brilliant political satire.

De Palma tries to film his great masterpiece switching from Hitchcock to Kubrick. Perhaps, not wholly satisfactory but fascinating and one of the most interesting film","Date":"11 October 1999","Score":"23 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" After giving us two excellent films - The Untouchables and Casualties of War director and auteur Brian De Palma tried to get the masters degree on major filmmaking with the very complex best-selling novel by Tom Wolfe. Faced to the challenge of making a great satire of nowadays America, De Palma does not find his own voice as he did in his two previous films, and goes back to the copy-and-paste path. This time it is not an imaginative and talented personal version of Hitchcock obsessions, but an interesting approach to Kubrick's style in Dr Strangelove and even Lolita. After confessing that the director he admires in a most intimate way is Stanley Kubrick, Brian De Palma uses the witty Tom Wolfe novel as the story he needs to imitate one of his most admired masters.The result is an excessive but funny satire. It is certainly underwritten, overacted and overdirected but, still, De Palma shows once again a great visual style and a wild sense of humour which makes us laugh several times.Perhaps, De Palma should have remembered that such a witty and complex story has to be told seriously with the apparent simplicity and hidden complexity he reached in Casualties of War, without trying to underline with the direction that every scene is supposed to be funny. Those strange camera angles taken from Kubrick nuclear satire do not work here and the characters are too exaggerated  -Jean Renoir said that each character has some reasons and here,if De Palma had tried harder not only to criticize but to understand them, it would have been a much more effective film- and being both a Kubrick and a De Palma fan, I think that Kubrick influence was not good at all here. In this satire, as in his Vietnam drama, such a talented director as De Palma  could have given more importance to substance that to form, given that this was not one of his brilliant thrillers where form is essential, but an intelligent satire about people. In fact, in many moments of the film De Palma uses a not so mannered and much more effective style and shows a great talent in portraiting situations ironically, something which is not usual in films from the nineties.Overall this work remains as one of the most aggressive portraits of America ever filmed. Perhaps this is why the film was a flop in the Box ffice  -it was absurd to make it with such a expensive cast and budget, given that such an acid satire cannot be popular- and De Palma's career, which was on his best moment, did not recover completely even after the wonderful Carlito's Way, one of his best films. If you study Film direction it is absolutely necessary to see it, because of its risks, mistakes and achievements.In conclussion, one of those strange films which you will find fascinating both because of its values and its mistakes.Forget about the novel; the film is an excessive and wild satire which will make you both think and laugh. De Palma genius and talent are present in many scenes. Moments like the initial shot, Alan King's speech, Clifton James,Donald Moffat or Andre Gregory performances -even the Morgan Freeman final scene, which De Palma did not like and is really good, reminding me of Capra, something extremely difficult in such a cynical decade- are not easy to forget.It is not often to find such a complex and interesting film. I strongly recommend it.

The Bonfire of the Vanities is actually an absorbing, slick-paced and well-acted piece of cinema that works on several levels. Tom Hanks is great as Sherman McCoy, a Wall Street hot shot whose life unravels because of one wrong turn into the Bronx. While behind the wheel of McCoy's Mercedes, his mistress accidentally strikes an intimidating young black man who approached the financial wizard. Enter Bruce Willis as Peter Fallow, a reporter eager to regain his reputation who sees the incident as just what the doctor ordered. The Bonfire of the Vanities is a fascinating look at how self interests trump decency, how public perception matters more than the truth, and how lies are sometimes necessary for the truth to surface. One of the reasons this film was so poorly received is that it isn't often laugh-out-loud funny. But Bonfire isn't really a comedy; it's a satire about contemporary society, and one that hits all too close to home.

In truth, it is neither.  The Bonfire of the Vanities is, however, funny in parts, poignant in parts, and entertaining throughout.The protagonist is Sherman McCoy, a man whose one fatal flaw (an affair we know of from the beginning) leads to the downfall from his envious position as a Master of the Universe.  Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance and shows real emotion in bringing this highly plausible character to life.  Unfortunately, his character is the only one with enough depth to be realistic.  Even Morgan Freeman's Judge White, representing a refreshing dose of intelligence and honesty in the film, is perhaps too good to be believed.  All of the other characters are mere caricatures, appearing too greedy, too pretentious, too self-absorbed, or too flighty to be believed.  Bruce Willis might have made himself an exception as well, but I feel he simply lacked enough screen time to flesh out the different faces he had to show.Nevertheless the story is very well told.  If the other characters appear less than convincing, accept them as colorful background for McCoy, who is the real focus anyway.  There are numerous laughs, and the other characters represent elements that are definitely present in society - even if not to the extent shown here. Wolfe's story is entertaining enough to make this movie worth seeing.  And it might even make you think twice about the names you see next time you open a newspaper.7 / 10 stars.

I can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous, provocative and important, yet failed so consistently across the board. It is like a stand up comic who's not getting laughs, but can't leave the stage. The harder the film tries, the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud. The desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved.The film achieves laugh-out-loud status only twice. Once is in the sight of Geraldo Rivera playing an obnoxious, arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist -- which is funny only because he apparently doesn't realize he is playing himself. The other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film's final big moment, wherein the judge played by Morgan Freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is (it's what your mama taught ya!). The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. Yet, one must admit it is a noble effort. It does have a good, if poorly cast, band of actors, who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures. The film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves are apparent, if not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics, never arises above the level of cartoon. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even sitcom requires timing. But the best Bonfires can muster is desperation. In the end, you don't want to laugh, you just want to turn away.

His only way out is to prove that it was not he who was driving the car but Maria....and she's gone.The Bonfire of the Vanities is one of those movies in which the presence of humanity serves one function only; to be laughed at. What we have here is satire of the media's effects on people's image, which despite being offencive and not very credible is funny and engaging enough, to make me say that it was worth my time.From the very beginning, Bonfire of the Vanities chooses to go as far over the top as possible. To put it lightly, the film is playful. The overall performance quality practically mirrors the exerted physical style of kabuki theatre. Much of the cast deliver their lines with funny/extreme faces and they throw their bodies up/down/around the frame to play drunk or angry or sexy with more flair. Some of this is enhanced by Brian de Palma's choice of extreme camera angles, and nice wide lenses.While there are times when the movie comes close to seeming obnoxious, I generally enjoyed Bonfire of the Vanities overwrought approach, something which I usually find a burden in movies. The movie is feisty for about ninety minutes, but the last half hour feels a bit draggy, and It seems to me like things could have been wrapped up faster. The ending, despite being the kind that we would like, feels stagy and a bit lame. I suppose it is easy enough to argue that the entire film is lame. I think a lot of critics have made that argument. Lame wouldn't quite be the word that I would choose. I would say that Bonfire of the Vanities is....goofy. For better or worse it is certainly watchable if you are an open minded viewer. It's not a very respectable motion picture, but it has entertainment value.

So let me make my position clear from the start. I have read Tom Wolfe's novel, and loved it, and yet I quite enjoyed the film as well.The story concerns Sherman McCoy, a rich Wall Street financier, whose life collapses after his car is involved in an accident in which a black teenager is seriously injured. Sherman, in fact, was not driving at the time of the accident (the car was being driven by his mistress Maria Ruskin), but he is unable to reveal this fact as he does not want his wife Judy to discover his extra-marital affair. The case is taken up by Peter Fallow, a cynical alcoholic journalist, and The Reverend Bacon, a populist black preacher, and becomes a cause celebre. Sherman is arrested and put on trial, while being pilloried in the media as a greedy, heartless white banker who recklessly injured a black youth and then callously abandoned him. The film-makers have softened Wolfe's plot by giving it a happy, or at least a happier, ending and by making the characters of Sherman and Fallow more sympathetic. Unlike in the book, Fallow undergoes a change of heart and becomes Sherman's ally rather than one of his tormentors.There seem to be two, related, reasons why the film's detractors dislike it. The first lies in the changes made to the plot. The second lies in what they see as inappropriate casting, and I have some sympathy with them as far as Tom Hanks, who plays Sherman, is concerned. In the original novel, Sherman was in many ways an unattractive character, the sort of man who regarded himself as a Master of the Universe, whereas in the film his arrogance and financial greed are very much played down. Admittedly, he is cheating on his wife, but as Kim Cattrall plays Judy as cold, sarcastic, snobbish and self-centred, even his infidelity does not prejudice us against him. In the eighties Hanks was best known for playing the hero of light comedies such as Splash and Big, and The Bonfire of the Vanities was clearly an attempt to extend his range into more heavyweight material. Nevertheless, Sherman still comes across as a typical Hanks character, the genial, likable Mr Nice Guy. This may have been quite deliberate on the part of the film-makers, but I thought that it wasted one of Wolfe's major themes, his criticism of the materialistic greed is good culture of the eighties. Despite his reputation as a socially conservative writer, Wolfe is no great admirer of unrestricted capitalism, which is also satirised in his second novel, A Man in Full.I felt that those who complained about miscasting concentrated too much on Hanks, as most of the other roles are well played. Certainly, there are some changes. In the book the brunette Maria is rather more sophisticated than the blonde, gold-digging bimbo played by Melanie Griffith, and Peter Fallow is a louche Englishman rather than the hard-bitten New Yorker played by Bruce Willis. Yet I felt that, in the context of the film, these particular characterisations worked well, even if the characters were not quite the same as those created by Wolfe. I also liked Cattrall as Judy and F. Murray Abraham as district attorney Abe Weiss, the cynical careerist who makes a great play of being a concerned liberal. He is the sort of prosecutor who is more interested in his political future- he has ambitions to become mayor of New York- than he is in justice; he is obsessed with Sherman's case because he believes that obtaining a conviction against a wealthy white defendant will ingratiate himself with black voters. (A Time to Kill, made a few years later, features a very similar DA, played in that case by Kevin Spacey- exxcept that Spacey's character wanted to convict a black defendant to ingratiate himself with white voters).Wolfe's book was never going to be an easy one to transfer to the screen. It is a long, complex book, written in the style of the nineteenth century novelists whom the author admires. Dickens was one major influence, and the title (apart from its reference to Savonarola's burning of luxuries in the Florence of the 1490s) is an allusion to Thackeray's Vanity Fair. Its complexity meant that its full nuances could never be transferred to the screen in full, and any cinema adaptation would have to be very much simplified. The solution adopted by director Brian De Palma and scriptwriter Michael Cristofer was to make the film as a satirical black comedy, and I think that, on the whole, this approach works quite well. The film might tone down Wolfe's satire on capitalist excesses, but it keeps some of his other targets. The film takes potshots at muckraking journalism- Fallow's articles are inspired less by sympathy with the injured boy than by the need to find a good story to ingratiate himself with his editor- at clergymen who misuse religion for political ends, and at the legal system, here represented by Weiss. The film, for me, will never quite capture the excitement I felt reading Wolfe's great novel, but it makes a respectable attempt at capturing something of its spirit. 7/10 "},{"Title":"De Palma at his best","Date":"15 May 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" What a movie!

The goal is survival within a particular kind of life style. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that's only touched upon. That aside, everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity, power, money or self aggrandizement.Wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York City over the head. His response was a denial. After all, he lived in New York himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked New Yorkers. (Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is no dummy.) Those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. Nobody was any good. And Sherman McCoy wound up broke, a professional protester for social justice. The movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable. Wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist -- he knows how to get inside a system and record its details.Yes, any of us might have found ourselves, as Sherman and his mistress do, stuck in the South Bronx, threatened by a couple of black kids, and making a getaway after bumping into one of them. That scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid. But after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message, however nebulous the message is. Sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel, but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo, take out a shotgun, and start shooting into the ceiling with it, as he does in the movee. In what's supposed to be a funny scene, ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away, shrieking. It simply would not have happened. The movie has left the novel's unspeakably detailed reality in the dust. Wolfe's sensibility, the work he put into capturing the real, has been lost. What we get instead is a noisy, fantastic, and silly scene that doesn't do anything except wake the audience up. Similar empty scenes follow, screaming out for Wolfe's verisimilitude.The movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism. Here we see Don Juan in Hell at the opera. We get lectures on redemption from a poet with AIDs. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again. A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin. The scene sits on the movie like a jester's cap on a circus elephant's head. The movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal, it overstates them, as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties.It's not the acting or the direction that's poor. The film's not bad in those respects. And the photography is pretty good too, including two rather spectacular shots -- the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde. It's the script that is thoroughly botched.The first half of the movie, roughly, is okay in conception and execution. It keeps some of the little details from the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is named Marshall. Who the hell would name a dog Marshall? It loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching.Wolfe's cynical redneck right-wingism may be offensive to a lot of people, but he's got the cojones to lay his percepts out. Alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers.

First, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial.  They are two different animals.The novel is probably intended as a satire, but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead.  Any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical thrust.  And lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another Mark Twain, think again.  A more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tails.  Tom Wolfe is equal parts clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grist for his self-absorbed mill. It is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start.  Unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior, but in a single-minded attack on specific people -- whether real or fictional straw men -- who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer.  Any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start, free of the writer's influence or interference.Having said that, I too find fault with the casting.  It is not merely that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure up, but that real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures.There is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire, but it fails to come even close.

I had a major problem with Hanks because he was simply too nice and too much of a likable person to capture what I've read the book was trying to do.

Willis isn't much better as the reporter with his boring narration and he's just not fun. I'd say the same with Griffith who at least shows off her body but little else.A lot of the blame has to go to director Brian DePalma who was on an incredible streak of hits before running into this thing.

Murray Abraham) and hard-drinking journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis) rear their heads to twist the ongoing s**t-storm to their own benefit.Despite some nice tracking shots and sets that really do capture the tacky glamour of the 80's, the movie's biggest downfall is the casting. The two leads, Hanks and Willis, are woefully miscast. McCoy is a loathsome character, a WASP-ish high-roller in an increasingly capitalist country, but Hanks is one of the most likable actors around. He looks visibly uncomfortable in a thinly- written role, and only takes control of his character in a scene in which he clears his apartment by unloading a shotgun played mainly for laughs, which at this stage of his career was Hanks's shtick. Fallow in the novel is a manipulative con-man, twisting the unravelling story through his newspaper in order to keep his job and make a nice paycheck along the way. But De Palma only seems to have picked up on his heavy drinking, meaning that Willis swings a bottle around and narrates the story, playing the role of spoon-feeder without playing an active role in story or convincing as someone who could get to his position.But then again, De Palma's movie doesn't exist in the real world. Arguably, the ensemble of characters in Wolfe's novel were caricatures, but they were well-rounded characters, and being inside their heads meant that we could understand their motives, something the movie entirely ignores. So we get the likes of Bacon, Weiss, lawyer Tom Killian (Kevin Dunn) and Assistant District Attorney Kramer (Saul Rubinek), all key players in the novel, reduced to scowling or bumbling onlookers, while McCoy squirms for our amusement and Fallow tells us what we're supposed to be thinking. Occasionally its an all-out pantomime, which would be forgivable it was funny or insightful. Yet when Wolfe calls for pantomime at the climax, the movie delivers a ridiculous speech spoken by Judge White (Morgan Freeman), informing us that decency is what your grandmother taught you.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "}{"Title":"Pretentious and Bland, its Dense Layers of Indulgence Ruin the Core Message","Date":"4 August 2014","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Self-absorbed, ridiculously carried-away trash that thinks it's way more edgy and pertinent than it actually is. An adaptation of a popular novel, it's clearly the victim of a studio mandate to swing hard, if not particularly accurately. It's loaded with starpower, with Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Melanie Griffith and Morgan Freeman sharing the spotlight, but none can help their sailing astronomically over the top with the material. Each character is more selfish and despicable than the last, even Freeman's grandstanding judge and Hanks's over-his-head bond trader on trial as political fodder. Lofty hunks of social commentary are swung around with all the subtlety of a war hammer, belaboring the point until we all lay bruised, bloodied and beaten on the floor. Potentially-pointed stereotypes get played like aces, but fail to register as more than a long series of cartoon characters with a big vocabulary. It's confused, sneering and wretched; no surprise it could only attract flies at the box office.

I'm pretty sure that the novel got into the heads of the characters more, and spent more time attacking its various targets. Though there are plenty of targets in the movie, the attack on them seems kind of soft and not as savage as it should be. A bigger problem is how the characters are presented. The actors play their parts more often than not in a broad and funny manner, which is not that funny at all. The correct way to approach this material would be to play it straight. I don't blame the actors for this - I blame director Brian De Palma for directing his talented cast to act this wrongheaded way.Though the movie is misguided, I didn't find it totally bad as some have made it out to be. I have to admit that as misguided as the movie is, and having a running time of over two hours, I was never BORED while watching it.

Somehow a serious plot got turned into a buffoonish comedy. Why Tom Hanks allowed himself to be duped into this part is beyond me. This was a serious book, it capsulized all of the things that made the 1980's the decade that it was. From unbridled greed on Wall Street to slick race card players such as Al Sharpton, it was a tumultuous decade. Tom Wolfe captured all these things, especially for those who lived, worked and breathed in New York City during this time. This movie deliberately remakes the events of the book to fit the political perspective of the director. It completely shys away from the main social issue (class warfare) and delivers up a pathetic attempt at social engineering the film for the purposes of not offending anyone.

This is not a bad film. Critics love to pan adaptations of superior novels that don't make the grade, something which is true of this particular film. However, a failure to capture all (or even most) of the satire and biting social commentary of such prose as Tom Wolfe's does not a bad film make. 2. This not a very funny film. If you want the humour, read the book, which is very funny. 3. If you sling enough s***, some of it's bound to stick. Alternatively, if you employ enough good actors, one of them is bound to (even if only by the law of averages) put in a good performance. For Bonfire of the Vanities has a sumptuous cast list, and amongst the mis-casting (Hanks, Willis - there go your two main characters) and the simply bad (step forward Melanie Griffith), there was always going to be one who nailed down one of Wolfe's creations. And in my humble opinion Morgan Freeman owns the role of Judge White. 4. Brian De Palma (or should that be his DoP) does know how to use a crane to effect. This is a very nice looking film.I'll keep the criticisms short, so here goes; No film of reasonable length could do justice to the full scope of Wolfe's novel, particularly his withering but hilarious critiques of all ethnic/social/professional sections of the New York society of the 1980s. However, Michael Christofer's script ignores pretty much all of them. The failure to correctly cast Sherman McCoy handicaps this adaptation badly - where's the confidence, the prejudice, the arrogance? (telling us that McCoy is a Master of the Universe is no good if we are given no reason to believe it) Oh, and Hanks is at least ten years too young for the part.I was going to continue, but i realised i could perhaps go on and on, and thus end up in retrospect having a deep dislike for Bonfire of the Vanities. However, i feel this would do injustice to my enjoyment whilst actually watching it. And isn't that the point?Except Melanie Griffith. For that, there is no excuse.

I, at that time, hadn't read the book and concluded that the critics had totally over reacted.  A friend gave me their battered copy of the book in 1996, by which time I'd forgotten the basic plot of the film. I read the book and totally enjoyed it.  I then watched the film again and suddenly I fully understood why the reviews had been so hateful.The novel is a bitter satire on greed, racism and social values during the late eighties.  The key word here is - bitter - because the film was a much more sunny, almost happy, comedy on a similar theme.  De Palma through awful casting and, almost certainly, pressure from the studio managed to lose the whole spirit and integrity of Tom Wolfe's novel.  The influence and desires of Hollywood had conspired to take away everything that was edgy.  Instead they managed to Hollywood-ise Wolfe's brilliant novel - for example, in the novel Sherman McCoy is found guilty, in the film he is acquitted.  The critics, not surprisingly, decided to focus on this dumbing down and hence the over the top reviews.In cinematic terms, and with no knowledge of the subject matter, Bonfire of the Vanities is not a bad film, but with knowledge of the book it's unequivocally the worst adaptation ever made.

People who want to see what good taste looks like, and how well mannered people trained and disciplined in good etiquette behave under pressure should see Bonfire Of The Vanities (1990) again and again and again.The set decorations tell the good taste story in wonderful (and expensive) detail, and the script showing well educated, well mannered people speaking up and speaking out tells the good taste story verbally.The irony is that this brilliant movie was widely accounted a failure by many associated with it.Academy Award Winner actor F. Murray Abraham gives a brilliant performance worth seeing over and over again....certainly one of his best ever in any movie he ever appeared in.

This shortfall in quality is by no means a reflection on the quality of acting or script but a glaring manifestation of the fact that it is next to impossible to communicate in cinematic form the details that a book can capture. The audience that has not read the book is likely to find the movie more engrossing but the overwhelming reaction is of less than fulfilled expectations.Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis play their parts with candor but their characterization does not attain glory because of the limitations implicit in the attempt to convert a masterpiece into a movie. The protagonist of The Bonfire of the Vanities is a hero and a mere mortal and a villain in curious measures, a character so contrived that even an actor of Tom Hank's caliber fails to portray the complexity in an effective manner. Bruce Willis though has an easier task of enacting a drunkard, sometimes incompetent but finally lucky journalist and he plays his part with usual flair but no distinction.The script has been modified from the novel to provide an ending more becoming of a Hollywood production, with the hero not ending in the predicament where he found himself in the book. However while the novel had the readers dulled into realization of the death of the vanities, the movie lets the audience feel flattered by a Hollywood finish. The book's ending is too hard hitting, the movie's merely filmy. The eternal challenge of conforming reality to art while conforming art to reality again gets the better of both the artists - the director as well as the writer.

In each case, their sponsoring environment presses in to perturb and pollute. In each case, they center the narrative on cartoonish drama, but the real art has nothing to do with the tokens. Rather, the art is in designing the distance between the reporter and the action.That is the whole of Wolfe's art, his placement of self to the world. His books are famously ghostwritten so far as the story -- to keep the tone and much of his language but have the story make sense. But the story doesn't matter, it is only an excuse for an abstract irony, a reverse voyeurism that readers like.This book is self-referential in that the author faces the same dilemma. The film was designed to also self-referentially encapsulate these two layers, forming a third. dePalma famously studies these problems and how they can be solved by the stance of the collective eye through his camera.So yes, the story in this film was destroyed by incessant meddling by the studio. Yes, the performances are way off as a result of rampant egos. Yes, the resulting story and characters are wholly unengaging. That's a plus, folks. Surely dePalma did not intend such a pool of muck, but it works for him just as is does for Wolfe and Fallows.dePalma's eye is cast here in the Nabokov mode another half step away from the action, commenting on itself but not quite sure where reality and fiction divide. The eye is ambiguous. We supposed to be subliminally aware of it note how few angles are ones a human would have, how few motions are ones an observer would make.The tone is indicated in the first shot where timelapse shows jets coming into Newark, turning into comets turning into the title. This is followed by a nearly five minute continuous traveling shot introducing Fallows as narrator, bringing him to us, the swarming crowd. It is only matched by that first scene in `The Player' (of the next year) which attempts the very same commented distance.Fallows as Hubert.

But on the big screen it only served to illustrate everything wrong with modern American movie-making executive interference, artistic compromise, and the fatal miscasting of bankable stars in inappropriate roles. Asking nice guy Tom Hanks to portray an arrogant, insensitive Wall Street yuppie ruined by a hit-and-run accident in the Bronx was a bad enough decision, but rewriting characters just to accommodate Bruce Willis (a jaded English journalist?) and Morgan Freeman (a fiery Jewish judge?) renders most of Wolfe's intended satire meaningless.

Brian De Palma is obviously a good director who knows how to pump pizazz and style into a scenario, but this doesn't seem like material he would be in love with. The long opening shot (done in one seamless take, going up in an elevator and then down different hallways) is exceptional, but the behavior of Willis in the scene (acting like a drunken jackass) is immediately off-putting.

Melanie Griffith, if she ever decides to quit movies and become part of an impersonation revue in Las Vegas, should mimic Dolly Parton (she sounds just like her). This is like some all-star comic book show, even Madeleine is here in the guise of Kirsten No one will see my body on celluloid... WHO CARES?!? Dunst as Campbell? McCoy. The story of a successful mover and shaker who makes an error at a phone booth that leads him to his doom is a silly, overwrought, ridiculously written bore that needs to be seen to be believed.

Brian De Palma has done satire before, and better, but this particular sort of satire isn't his strong suit - it's not an escapist work, nor are the characters supposed to be all that likeable. The casting is wrongheaded, the script is amateurish, and the ending - while a potentially interesting one - is handled weakly. However, that's where the criticism ends. The rest of the movie attempts to make up for its losses, and end result comes off as being more than a little watchable. The minor roles are done very well, the cinematography is top-notch, and most significantly, the live-action cartoon aesthetic is weirdly engaging in a hypnotic sort of way. De Palma's own odd sense of humor is at odds with the written material - in a more perfect world, the producers would have ditched Cristofer's script and let De Palma just sit around and get down with his own wacky self - but that, too, makes it somewhat interesting. It's not the sort of thing I'd heartily recommend to everyone, but it's hardly the abomination people would lead you believe. So far as supposed turkeys go, it's a pretty engaging 2 hours. In fact, in light of the  novel's caustic nature, the movie's harmlessness has been its own worst enemy. If the book had never been written, I'm sure this movie would have gotten a better rep as simply a slight but spry black comedy; however, the novel has been written, and it made nine dollars at the box office, so failure it remains. Rent it if it sounds interesting to you, or catch it on TV if it plays. It's really not that bad.

Those who have read the book by Tom Wolfe, and those who have not. Some may know a little more about what the book is before seeing the movie, but in general at least the uninitiated have some idea. I read the book, and heard the backlash on the movie, and even began to read the book by Julie Salomon about the making of the movie, The Devil's Candy. It is a tremendous book, a razor-sharp satire and dark human tragic-comedy where everyone is unlikeable, and yet by a certain point the person who should be most unlikeable and unsympathetic, Sherman McCoy, the Wall-Street Bond Trader who is brought in on charges of reckless endangerment for his car running over a black honor student, ironically becomes a little more sympathetic (or just understandable and human, is perhaps the point).Seeing the movie with someone who hasn't read the book, however, is a valuable experience, and the friend I watched it with confirmed my own thoughts the movie isn't so terrible as to completely throw on the heap of directorial toxic-sludge (it doesn't come close to, say, Godard's King Lear as a cinematic cluster-f***), and some of the performances are actually good or at least decent- SOME being a key word here- but it's also confused and baffling, and not very funny most of the time. De Palma's inspiration in putting the characterizations forward was Dr. Strangelove, where characters are in a heightened reality and no one is really just a character but is larger-than-life. This was fine for Kubrick when taking his source material, which was quite serious as a Nuclear-war book, and making into a gaudy spectacle.De Palma should have asked himself something simple, which is why make something already so good into something else? Is The Bonfire of the Vanities, as a movie, a satire? Yes and no. Yes in that it takes on subjects like Wall Street bond traders and high society big shots and ne'er-do-wells and tabloid journalists and district attorneys (and assistant district attorneys) and an opportunistic reverend and gives them a skewering. It screams out YES, WE'RE SATIRE without going to an extreme like Spike Lee's Bamboozled did, though that's an apt comparison. But no in that De Palma, whether it was mostly himself second guessing in pre-production or by pressure of the studios, had to make things more 'likable' and 'sympathetic'. Mainstream was probably a key word between De Palma and the studio execs and people worried about such a controversial book as Wolfe's (one would like to think just the studio's fault but who knows the percentage of blame).And yet I would be lying if I said I thought it was a failure and totally horrible movie like so many other critics and viewers did. It's not, really. It's like an interesting fall on the face, and seeing the parts that are interesting get one through the running time. It's at least never boring; Tom Hanks, though just a few years shy young to play McCoy as written in the book, does have his moments where he gets to shine as an actor, and is even really funny a few times (my favorite scenes in the movie have him in it, one where he's interrogated by the detectives and bumbles it completely with the word 'routine', and the other when he unloads his twelve-gage rifle with total abandon around his bemused dinner guests, hilarious, perhaps, just seeing Hanks doing this). Other actors like Kim Cattral, (very sexy) Melanie Griffith, and Saul Rubinek do decently in supporting roles. F. Murray Abraham, for all of his over the top theatrics, actually gets perhaps most what De Palma's intention is with the material, and rolls with it (not to mention amazing bit parts for Andre Gregory and Richard Belzer).But the two big gaffs here, one of which a really huge one that brings the film down from interesting misfire to practical disaster, is the casting of the Judge and Peter Fallow. It's one thing to get a character totally wrong on paper, which does happen here, and it's another to cast it wrong. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, and has no real place here in the film. Even putting aside the intent of Wolfe with the Judge- that he was, by the way, and old Jewish man who, along with the D.A. Abe Weiss, meant to reflect the 'old guard' of judges from the Bronx- Freeman is given little to do except yell out like he's reprising the principal in Lean on Me, and give a totally ham-fisted, awfully written movie speech at the end. He does what he can with the material, but ultimately, for however few minutes he's on screen, it's a bust.And Peter Fallow. Holy hell this is a misfire on all counts. Watching Bruce Willis on screen one realizes the dark side of Hollywood, where casting a star for safety sake can completely backfire when it's not right. The writing by Michael Christofer doesn't do any favors, as the narration stinks mostly anyway, but Willis is a lump on screen, barely doing anything to make him interesting... and yet, unlike in the book, most egregiously, we're meant to side with him in some way, or find him kind of, you know, sympathetic in some way. The original choice for Peter Fallow- a sly, lackadaisical drunk- was John Cleese. The gulf between the two choices is wide enough to put a blue whale in. Even if everything else worked great in Bonfire of the Vanities, Willis, his acting and the character as a whole, would make the film flawed on its own. In other words What Were They Thinking?

Maybe some people thought that it was trying to capitalize on what Wall Street showed a few years earlier.When I saw it several years later, I thought that it was quite well done. Like Wall Street, it does show the decadence, cynicism, and greed inherent in the lives of rich New Yorkers. But this one has sort of a comedic tone. It portrays stock broker Sherman McCoy's (Tom Hanks) self-serving lifestyle getting thrown into flux when his mistress Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) accidentally runs over a young African-American. This incident ignites people's emotions all over the board, which may be the title's implication Sherman's vain existence is crashing down, and he's getting exposed to groups whom he had never even considered earlier.Personally, I couldn't understand why the critics and public didn't like this movie (considering that we made the kitschy Home Alone a hit around the same time, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves for ignoring TBOTV). It looks at the various problems with our society greed, racism, and yellow journalism. Bruce Willis, whom I usually find obnoxious, does a really good job here as reporter Peter Fallow, out to make a few bucks by blowing the story up as much as possible. There's also a character based on Rev. Al Sharpton.All in all, this is a move worth seeing. It's definitive proof that Brian DePalma was a lot better before he got all Hollywood with Mission Impossible, Snake Eyes, etc. Also starring Morgan Freeman, a very young Kirsten Dunst, and several people (among them F. Murray Abraham and Andre Gregory) in small roles. Watch for Malachy McCourt (the brother of Angela's Ashes author Frank McCourt) as the doorman.And yes, I once thought that the title was something like Vampire of the Bonnies.

Far more interesting is The Devil's Candy, a book written by Julie Salamon, a Wall Street Journal film critic who was given unlimited access to the film's production. The book highlights De Palma's battles with producers, studio executives and actors, and the mood of overall futility that overcame the director toward the end of the production.For example, De Palma didn't want either actor Tom Hanks or Bruce Willis to star in the picture, but being big money magnets at the time, they were forced upon him. Willis and De Palma would also get into heated arguments, the star frequently turning up both drunk and late. The changing of the novel's subplot from Jewish to African American also irked the director, as well as studio imposed cuts (which removed almost half an hour of footage) and star Melanie Griffith ditching the shoot for breast enlargement.But hilariously, De Palma's big beef seems to be that he was not allowed to shoot in locations or buildings he found appealing. Generally speaking, De Palma is all about photographing space and careening through fine architecture. On Bonfire of The Vanities, however, he got saddled with locations which he says he simply had no desire to shoot. Indeed, some of the only memorable shots in the film were done by second unit photographers, De Palma abdicating duty to his crew.Beyond all this, Bonfire has vague allusions to a number of other De Palma films. It's tale, for example, of wealthy careerists who become pawns to corporate kings echo De Palma's Get To Know Your Rabbit, and of course De Palma's own career trajectory. There is some self-reference in the fact that the film's cast spins out of control, dancing to the tune of the money men, but this only makes for appropriate irony, not good cinema.Bonfire contains a number of flamboyant sequences, most notably the long take which opens the film, but they're all ugly and garish, shot in sterile back-room corridors or packed with grating dialogue. In interviews De Palma would insist that he always has final cut, a statement which is ironic considering the level of studio meddling his films garner. Most recently he claimed to have had final cut on Black Dahlia and Redacted, yet one film had its coda censored and the other lost almost an hour of footage. Regardless, no amount of restored or removed footage can help Bonfire of the Vanities. It's a poor film, of interest only to De Palma completists.3/10 - Worth no viewings.

There are bad performances by everyone, as a result of bad writing and bad direction, since Brain De Palma was either entirely blind to the overacting going on constantly in the frame or actively encouraging the actors to be as broad as possible so as to drive home the utterly juvenile and excruciatingly clumsy observations of his satiric portrait.

The whole thing comes across like the overindulgence of drug-fueled hacks.What is so genuinely mystifying is that the individual talent involved is really quite remarkable. Writer Michael Cristofer has won a Pulitzer and a Tony; Cinematographer Zsigmod is a multi-award winner who worked on 'Deliverance', 'Close Encounters...' and 'The Deer Hunter'; Production Designer Sylbert is a legend in the industry, having worked on 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', 'Rosemary's Baby', and 'Chinatown', winning two Oscars along the way; Costume Designer Ann Roth is one of the most talented and celebrated around, having worked on everything from 'Midnight Cowboy' to 'Cold Mountain'; and the central cast has seven Oscar nominations and three wins between them.The blame, therefore, can only really be laid at the door of Brian De Palma, or else the producers (80s power players Guber and Peters) who were either too spineless or too coked up to reign him in. De Palma is a wildly inconsistent director at best, who possesses an almost pathological inability to suppress a natural inclination towards baroque and outlandish excess. Occasionally, this serves the story - 'Phantom of the Paradise', 'Carrie', 'Scarface', even the 'The Untouchables' require a certain degree of bog-eyed hysteria to work.

A cast spearheaded by Hanks, Willis and Freeman, supported by Griffith, Cattrall, Rubinek and Dunn is worth seeing in itself. But I don't think they act up to their ability. Hanks wasn't a proved serious actor then, and didn't accomplish much with this. Willis has a rather small (but for the story important) role but was mostly added to help the movie at the box office with his name. Griffith, and Rubinek only annoys me. The only actor that don't disappoint is Freeman, and his role is limited. Actually, there seem to be a more interesting story behind the casting of the movie than the movie itself. Check the trivia.

It was a predictable disaster. Well, perhaps not quite a disaster, if you've never read the book, but a major disappointment if you have. Predictable, because the central point of the book is a scathing indictment of contemporary urban liberalism--and who is Hollywood full of, but contemporary urban liberals? They just couldn't bring themselves to play it straight, and instead softened every blow by turning each complex, vivid character from the book into a caricature, a mere cartoon.

Of course, it is almost a given that a movie will rarely live up to the novel, but I think I would have rated this a stinker even had I not read the book.There is a frantic, hyper emery running throughout the movie, that just doesn't work. I think the scene where McCoy and the girlfriend are stopped and she yells out It's a dead tire? stands out in cinematic history as a scene where a joke falls so completely flat, that it's embarrassing. And the movie's one attempt to be sincere, right near the end, comes off as trite.The movie's cartoonish characters and outlandish turns of events (shooting at one's ceiling to get rid of one's dinner guests) all contribute to an unwatchable mess.To return to the book the book was brilliant in that it portrayed people and events realistically, and cleverly brought out the ridiculous aspects of everyday life. The film captured not one iota of this spirit. Just horrible. Really not worth your time, on any level.I hope that someone will redo this once as a miniseries, because it really could be excellent.

It was well grounded in a time and place. I'll add too that I've never particularly liked Brian de Palma films (too stylized and in my view, there's no there, there).Sooooooo, anyway. This movie is a mess. And the question is why? (This is a fun game to play with monumental flops such as Waterworld, Heaven's Gate, Ishtar.) In the case of Bonfire of the Vanities, was it the casting? The script? Inappropriate music? I'd go with direction. If I can make a really dumb comparison, this movie is like receiving a Lamborghini but delivered as an IKEA kit. It winds up as beautiful parts lying on the garage floor.For anyone tempted to see this movie, I strongly suggest reading Julie Salamon's well-written Devil's Candy beforehand. (Check it out on Amazon; the book follows chronologically the film's production from the beginning to the end.) Since the movie is so bad, you're not going to enjoy watching it anyway. But Salamon's book is so good that watching the movie almost turns it into a documentary. Various scenes and small roles take on new meaning. I guarantee you'll rewind to watch again the shot of the Concorde landing and then realize that somehow, it's a metaphor of what went wrong.

I am a die hard DePalma fan and I must say that the film makes it's points (however broad they may appear). There is hidden and overt racism in politics, there are corrupt people in politics and the clergy and yes, even poor people act worse than rich people. But honestly, Wolfe's book was not the --bleeping-- Bible and should not be as revered as it was. Adaptation from book to film always has a life of its own and everyone who sees and makes films should take this into account.Proof of this is the clever prologue and epilogue where they even lampoon the bull (ish) praise this book received!

Although it may not be as horrible as the critics believed it was, it is still a poorly made movie. The many problems include the general miscasting of just about every lead and costarring role -- Tom Hanks as a WASP, Melanie Griffith as a southern-belle, Bruce Willis as himself, basically; all the actors overact and mug shamelessly, as if this is the key to comedy; and the cinematography and direction are handled in a very showy and self-conscious manner. But worst of all is the writing. It wasn't so much a problem with a book that was difficult to adapt to the screen, but the fact that the screenwriter contradicted what the book was all about. The satire and irony in the novel was gutted in favor of a broad, farcical type of comedy. The producers showed their cowardice by politically correcting certain characters (the judge played by Morgan Freeman), and changing the original downbeat ending of the book into a typical Hollywood happy ending. The reporter that Willis was cast to play was changed from a venal and unlikable character to one more in line with the ingratiating Willis persona. Most embarrassing of all, Freeman's character gives an idiotic, simple-minded uplifting speech near the end of the film (suddenly, Bonfire becomes a Frank Capra film). It's as if the filmmakers were frightened of the controversial book they decided to adapt that they turned it into a lighter and more inconsequential movie. One that audiences stayed away from in droves.

This movie, Bonfire of the Vanities, though is utter crap and the even sadder part is the large cast of good actors it has. Everyone on this must have been wasted not to see the jumble of crap they were making to sell to audiences. Their all lucky to still have jobs. Bruce Willis does nothing to make this story better and basically just sits through the whole movie.

From the offset the movie never showed signs of being normal. A slight comedic element should definitely have been don't better by Bruce Willis who demonstrated his funny edge in 'The Whole Nine Yards' while Tom Hanks shined in such classics as 'Forrest Gump' and more recently 'The Terminal'. So what went wrong? Well the story line, in which Tom Hanks rich person runs someone over and is discovered for it, could be concocted into a very descent story line, perhaps not comedy. But this script made no real sense from chapter one. Odd acting styles from both leads (Hanks, Willis). The movie would not be one for a vivid Wllis or Hanks fan.

With a great cast as this, something a little more thoughtful was certainly achievable; some halfway intelligent examination could be made of the events and the aftermath. I suppose there is supposed to be some sort of point in making the movie in this way, but it's hard to see what it would be. It doesn't take long to become irritated with the movie. It's annoying and frustrating to watch. There isn't anything remotely funny about any of this. Tom Hanks is a great actor, but he has certainly made a few bad choices in roles.

He has money in spades, a socialite wife, a Park Avenue apartment, a mistress and a very nice car. While out with that same mistress (Maria) in that same expensive car, Sherman takes a wrong turn and ends up in the Bronx where, in a moment of panic at being confronted by crowds of non-whites, Maria hits a black man and they drive off back to normal white society. Sadly for Sherman, this minor incident escalates when the boy goes into a coma and his car is identified as the one involved, Add to this a DA who desperately needs to win the ethnic vote by prosecuting a rich white person and a journalist who, desperate to get off skid row, talks up the story with a series of sensationalist headlines that twist the truth. As these factors all come into play, Sherman's tidy, rich, white world starts to crumble.Years after the critical kicking that the film got about 15 years ago, I decided to watch Bonfire for only the second time (the first being over a decade ago) to see it without the pressure of the dogs that were unleashed on it at the time of release. Watching it now, having never read the source material, what is evident is that it has some elements to it that make it worth seeing but ultimately make it a rather heavy handed affair that doesn't work that well in several regards. At its heart the film is a solid dig at the socialites of New York and the moral vacuum that exists within it and the business world that supports it; in fact it has digs at plenty of other of institutions and groups but this is at the centre of it. In essence you can see how this was a good idea but it all falls to bits in the delivery; the film doesn't trust us to understand this if it was done subtly and so it is all done in a heavy-handed manner that makes the same points over and over until you feel a bit browbeaten.The narrative is interesting in the concept but it is developed to extremes to the point where it seems overdone. This is best seen in the characters, who lose their sense of reality and become almost caricatures instead; in a way this helps because they can be recognised even by those not part of New York culture but it damages it in the long run because it is impossible to identify with or care for the characters. Perhaps that is why the actors appear to struggle as much as they do and deliver very poor performances. Willis hadn't shown himself then to be the actor I know believe him to be capable of being and thus he just delivers a smirking, one-note character that is very little use. Hanks is not a great deal better; he plays his character too wide-eyed and innocent to convince as part of the community that the film is attacking; when his collapse comes, it comes too quickly and in too much comedy style. Griffith has one joke to make and she makes it over and over again with nothing else behind it. Cattrall, Rubinek, Dunn, Murray and Freeman all do reasonably well in support but none have the characters to really make anything happen beyond the basics.Overall this is not the horror show that some critics made it out to be but it is a fairly poor film that turns an interesting concept and satirical goldmine into a messy, noisy affair that lacks a real cohesion and subtlety. The actors are adrift in the middle of all this and suffer as a result. The points it makes are OK but you have to wonder what sort of idiots De Palma takes us for because he keeps making them over and over again, but this was just one of many problems that the film had that it couldn't resolve.

This is constantly referred to as his hugest flop and largest disappointment, probably for good reason. Its cast -- Tom Hanks, Melanie Griffith, Bruce Willis and Kim Cattrall -- are hardly unpopular and the material is fairly interesting.What, then, went wrong? In my opinion The Bonfire of the Vanities is just poorly executed. I saw this film years ago and lost interest in it almost immediately. The dark humor grows tiresome and isn't nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Tom Hanks isn't really believable in his role and the whole cast seem to be high on something; Bruce Willis in particular is giving a really odd performance, and I didn't have a clue what he was trying to accomplish with his character. He's supposed to be a drunk, but he came across as something more desperate.The film follows the events in the life of Hanks after he takes a wrong turn off an interstate highway and ends up in a rough area of the city. His girlfriend accidentally hits a black kid in the street, and they try to cover it up, fearing for their lives.What follows is a satire of something. I'm not sure exactly what because De Palma loses vision of his goal very early on. I didn't know whether to laugh, or gasp in horror. It's a very strange movie.That said, the critics are a bit TOO harsh on it. I would hardly call this the total waste of time some people made it out to be on release. It is widely considered one of the most infamous atrocities of cinema and I don't think it's quite deserving of that sort of reaction.It did push De Palma's career back a few years, though, didn't it?

Certainly they could have made more of insider trading (Wall Street), infidelity (Fatal Attraction), the guts of newspaper reporting (All the President's Men) and courtroom intrigue (...And Justice for All) than what's been made of them here.  DePalma is a better director than this.  Hanks, Griffith and Willis are better actors than this.  Heck, even Kim Cattrall has done better than this.  It's not that Bonfire is so inherently bad, it's just that so little is done with it.  They had the whole '80s to work with.  And Tom Wolfe, of all people, even helped to work on the screenplay (from his own book).  Maybe he was too busy calculating his scripting fee?In fact, the only one who comes out of this mess relatively unscathed is Freeman as Judge White.  He's certainly the only one who can stand back and see that all that has transpired has come from greed and that both sides have been corrupted by their own wants and desires.  Now, why couldn't they have given that kind of insight to everyone else in this film?I understand that the book is infinitely better.  I hope so; I'd like to think that somewhere out there is a way that this same story makes more sense.Two stars.  One star for DePalma's scant contributions and another for no sequels. ...yet. "}]
