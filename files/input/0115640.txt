Having grown up around the area in the film and being only a few years older than the featured boys, it was a joy to see life there depicted in the film. I agree with all previous comments about the actors and how true-to-life it feels. Although slightly exaggerated in places, this film is a great comment on London working class life as well as being focused around a gay-based storyline.However, I wanted to add that this film also comments on the complex class system in the UK which explains why Tony was dropped by Sandra. Many non-British viewers may not have picked up on this. Thoughout, Tony is shown as a middle class character who doesn't really fit into the working class environment. He uses different slang words to the others, has a 'posher' accent and has slightly different attitudes to all the other characters. He and Sandra come from different worlds. As Sandra says, she has been fighting all her life, whereas he has had evertyhing given to him on a plate. Ultimately, this relationship was never going to last. Life in London (and the UK) is still spilt into different social classes, although they do mix a little more than they used to. But you can often tell where someone is from by their accent and their choice of words. This was used to great affect in the film.Overall, a light-hearted look at life on a London council Estate with some great performances... one of my favourite films.

Albeit the end is a little wishful  and optimistic, the characters and situations are perfectly developed and  realized, ringing true in almost every scene.  This movie makes me smile on  every level...from the way the two boys discover their affection for one  another, the wonderful comedy relief from the next door neighbor Leah (and  her relationship with the entire tenement population), and the perfect  choice of soundtrack music from Mama Cass that, at times, seems written  specifically for certain scenes and works on both a nostalgic and  familiarity level.  This movie gets better with every viewing...and I'd  love to see what happened to each of the characters in a sequal.This movie is, without a doubt, very personal to all gay men and women who  came out during their youth and a favorite of all of my friends, both gay  and straight.

This movie is another example of this fact. This movie rates as one of the best in this genre.  Get Real comes a close second.The young actors that play Jamie and Ste do an extraordinary job sometimes forgetting how well they pull off such complex characters throughout the movie.  I think any gay man growing up can relate to Jamie. He doesn't excel in sports, and almost too smart for his own mother.  He is comfortable with his sexuality, and he doesn't give a damn what the world thinks of him.  Ste, on the other hand, fears his older brother, and his father made his life miserable. As he states in the film, they made me ugly. Ste is not all ugly, and Jamie realizes this, and is attracted to his brash, manly demeanor. Unfortunately, Ste's own demons and his insecurities are present throughout the film.  At one point, Ste ashamed of rumors of his questionable sexuality, denies it to a heartbroken Jamie.Obviously, I enjoyed this movie. The scenes between Jamie and his mother and likewise, between Jamie and Ste, are perhaps the best parts of the movie. I understand having Leah in the movie to provide the supporting role of comic relief was a necessity in most film requirements, but in this one, it distracted the viewer to an extent. I was so glad when it came out on DVD, so I can put my last VHS tape to rest, but disappointed that there were no cast interviews or extras at the end. Granted, the movie was made six years or so after the DVD came out, but you might think the film makers would find something of interest.So England what will be the next great gay movie ?

My favourite scenes are actually sequential first, the shot of Sandra following the boys in a cab, as the shock & turmoil of her emotions is beautifully portrayed during this scene; second, the followup scene with the boys in the park, probably, for me, the most wonderfully innocent, beautiful and intimate scene in the film.

It deals with Jamie (Glen Berry) who is in high school. He's thin, shy and has problems with his mother Sandra (Linda Henry). A school mate named Ste (Scott Neal) has problems with his abusive father. They meet and end up realizing they're gay and in love. Also there is a black girl neighbor who is always blasting songs by Mama Cass! Moving and VERY well made drama. It was shot in Thamesmead England so the accents are hard to follow sometimes but you eventually get the hang of it. Berry and Neal, who were both teenagers when this was shot, played their roles perfectly. You can see in their faces and body language the confusion they're feeling and trying to deal with their orientation. When they run around in a dark wood and start kissing with Make Your own Kind of Music booming on the soundtrack it's absolutely ecstatic and liberating! Also they're not painted as saints. They come across as normal teenage boys. Henry is just incredible as Jamie's mother. All kidding aside, I'm shocked that she wasn't nominated at the England Academy Awards for this performance. You see her and Jamie trying to deal with each other and her realizing he's gay. This all leads to a GREAT moment at the end when Ste and Jamie are dancing to Dream A Little Dream Of Me holding each other close right out in public. Sandra sees this and starts dancing with a black women right next to them. The defiant look on her face to everybody was just right! I remember seeing this when it came out in 1996 and actually crying (out of happiness) at the end. This was an unexpected art house hit in 1996 and ushered in (for a few years anyway) a tidal wave of gay films. Moving, beautifully acted and how can you resist a movie with a Mama Cass soundtrack?

Where Brokeback Mountain left me devastated and believing happiness couldn't ever last (I will never watch it again), and Latter Days is a prime example of style over substance, Beautiful Thing makes me feel like love is out there and it's really worth fighting for. It has stayed with me vividly and powerfully since I first saw it, and I continue to watch parts of it often.I don't know if Glen Berry or Scott Neal could have realized what an impact this film would have on some viewers, but I wish I could thank them for bringing such humanity, realism, and likability to the roles of Jamie and Ste. Linda Henry, too, in the brilliant role of Sandra, gives a performance worthy of an Oscar, and Sandra's boyfriend Tony (played perfectly by Ben Daniels) is hilarious and surprisingly endearing. The script is not self-conscious or saccharine; it is uplifting without being preachy, and tender without being grating. If you're gay or just a human being with empathy and understanding (and a good sense of humor -- the script is terribly clever and the film really benefits from multiple viewings), Beautiful Thing is an experience you should not miss. It's a film I will cherish forever, enhanced by the music of Mama Cass Elliot (who was truly gifted and whose death was a great loss).Favorite scenes (though almost every scene is really a favorite) the Make Your Own Kind of Music chase in the woods (I may love this scene more than anything else ever), the bedroom scenes with Jamie and Ste, and the final sequence, (featuring Mama Cass's beautiful Dream a Little Dream of Me) which I will not spoil -- I envy the first-time viewer, who is in for a huge treat. I like to think that Jamie and Ste live on forever in the final shot, the future uncertain but the present a greater joy than they had ever known, their love a small but bright glimmer of hope in an otherwise gray world.

Unlike many gay films, it manages to display sympathy for its characters without becoming unduly celebratory (a tone that rarely makes for good cinema). In fact, it has something of the feel of a Mike Leigh film, although it's a lower key affair than most of Leigh's movies a little less intense, a little less depressing, and a just little less funny.

On one hand, it's a nice little low budget film about two young boys coming to grips with their sexuality amidst a colorful cast of characters living in the same apartment building. But on the other hand, I couldn't help but feel something was missing here.Being a gay male myself, I haven't delved very much into the world of gay cinema, but I will say I was pleased that nothing in this film seemed intent on exploiting homosexuals, which is the very thing that has kept me away from the genre most of the time. The story unfolds in a very low-key manner, and for once I didn't feel as if the filmmakers were simply trying to cash in on the hordes of homosexuals out there that will pay to see anything they can relate to, not even realizing the filmmakers are just after their wallets.For a movie whose central feature is the evolving love story between two teenage boys, Jamie and Ste, I felt it was void of the usual pitfalls that plague most movies in this vein--thankfully, the clich√©s are kept to a bare minimum, and there's very little of what I like to call Hollywood-isms in the film, which I was grateful for. The chemistry between the two male leads was what kept me watching the film, as I felt the writing and the casting were both spot on in this department.If anything leaves me humbled and a little puzzled, however, it has to be the film's focus on the other inhabitants of the apartment complex, mainly a vivacious black girl who is friends with the two leads, Jamie's mother and her new boyfriend, as well as Ste's father. Jamie's mother is struggling to land a job managing her own pub, while her new boyfriend struggles with fitting in. Couple this with multiple scenes of the black female behaving oddly while singing oldies songs, and I have to honestly say I don't see what relevance any of these story threads add to the overall plot. I feel as if by writing this, someone more educated will step in and point it out to me, thereby making me feel stupid, but alas...as it stands right now, I felt most of these scenes were rather pointless. It also doesn't help that the end is a little anticlimactic, making me wonder why they spent so much time building up these little anecdotal vignettes of story lines if they were just going to leave them hanging in the end anyway.By the time the end rolled around, I was a little puzzled. There are some good things here, yes, but then other things that make no sense to me as well. In any case, I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, cute little film about young homosexuals, without all the Hollywood hoopla.

The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film.Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu.The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively.The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people, the journey is a little easier for these two, but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.More of my reviews at iheartfilm.weebly.com "},{"Title":"Flawed but sweet","Date":"24 January 2010","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Every now and then, when I'm in the mood to watch a sweet little gay romance, I dig out my VHS copy of Beautiful Thing. The film has its flaws. Exchanges of dialog that aren't quite believable. (They perhaps worked better on stage than on screen since we expect less realism on stage.) Ben Daniels was miscast as Tony, or at least needed better make-up and wardrobe he doesn't look young enough or privileged enough for that character. And then there's that annoying closing dance in the courtyard......But before I launch into that pet critique, let's talk about what works well in this film. Excellent use of actual locations in Thamesmead the film gives you the feeling of settling into the real-world geography. Great music--and I have in mind not only the Mamas and the Papas but also the very clever selection from The Sound of Music and the sweet, understated John Altman instrumental that recurs through the movie. Superb acting of the kind you expect from the British even the small parts feel like three-dimensional, fully thought-out characters. The two male leads aren't especially attractive (as would have been required if this had been an American production), but they make the romance so endearing that they somehow seem to get cuter as the film progresses.My great regret about this film--the thing that keeps me from enjoying it as un-self-consciously as I would like, and as the filmmakers presumably hope I would--is that closing scene where Ste and Jamie dance in the courtyard, ignoring the crowd around them. My understanding (someone correct me if I'm mistaken) is that in the play, that final dance occurred in the relatively more private space of Jamie's balcony, which makes so much more sense. I can understand why Jonathan Harvey and Hettie Macdonald would be tempted to provide a more dramatic, defiant, celebratory coming out for the end of the movie. And I have tried so hard over the years to justify that decision in my head as a believable event in the world of this movie Ste and Jamie are both accustomed to being victims of violence, so the decision to live openly is a knowing, calculated risk. Ste is presumably leaving the estate to move into the new pub with Jamie and Sandra, so he's no longer in danger from his father and brother, as everyone had been so afraid earlier. Jamie's making foolish decisions in the reckless euphoria of coming out, but Sandra's there watching out for him, glaring at the crowd like a mother velociraptor, daring anyone to threaten her child.I've tried to explain the closing scene in all those ways. But the fact remains that after all the work this film went through to make itself believable--the locations, the superb acting--it lapses inexplicably at the final, crucial moment into a fairy tale ending. That was an unfortunate decision, and tagging the film An urban fairytale doesn't suffice to make the decision palatable. This film simply has the wrong ending. I've seen Harvey say that he wanted to provide a positive image of hope for gay working-class youth. Those young people would have been better served, and the story would have been sweeter, had the film stayed more believable up through the end.Still, the film's worth digging out from time to time for another viewing.

Shes, hard as nails, a worker, and essentially a great mother though this is not always easy to see at the beginning of the film but as the story progresses it becomes clear that she has struggled and fought for her son throughout his short life. Once his homosexuality comes out into the open the real fight is only just starting. Jamie falls for abused neighbour/school friend Ste. Both the characters of Jamie and Ste are played with such professionalism throughout. There are some bedroom scenes which could have been over played, but in this film much is left to the imagination of the viewer. The young boys really do justice to the great writing and direction. The supporting cast are much in the back ground except Leah, a rather troubled girl in from the same housing block who provides some of the more amusing moments and pathos especially with her devotion to the music of 'Mama Cass. The British class system also comes into the film via Sandras latest boyfriend, Tony. Again this difference is played for what it is - a difference in backgrounds and cultures. It is not played for laughs. It is just there all the situations in this film appear to be normal and not contrived or put into the film for the sake of it. Tony does however, make a valuable comment during the film. When Jamies homosexuality is known by Sandra she is seen out on the balcony crying and thinking about how she brought Jamie up on her own. Tony's comment about nothing having changed is a wonderful moment in the film. The climax of the film shows Sandra and Jamie moving a step up in the world and Sandras acceptance of her sons sexuality. She makes a great comment to her best friend Gina; Gina, I shall never have grandchildren. I mentioned earlier the humour. This is typical British dry humour which i can imagine would pass some non Brits by as it isn't slap-stick or obvious but subtle and natural; and comes from the excellent script. Good examples of this are the love/hate relationship between Sandra and Leah which provides some very funny one liners and also the conversations Sandra and Jamie have together. There is some wonderful pathos! I saw this film first when it was shown in the 1990s (when it did cause some controversy in the UK) and again in 2006 and it has not dated at all. It still looks as fresh and good as the day of release.It shows a hot summer on a London Housing estate where two young people find themselves. The picture is more like a window into the lives of the people on the estate. You can easily imagine that life went on before the film and indeed is continuing much the same today.

A local Chicago theatre company (Famous Door) presented an absolutely first-rate production that eventually played off-Broadway in NY. To say that the play was a revelation is a complete understatement . . . we were completely blown away. We connected to the story, to the excellent cast, to the simple but effective production. After the play we had to get something to eat so that we could continue talking about it! A year or so later, while we were living in Richmond, VA, the Richmond Triangle Players also presented the play. That production was somewhat unique because the actress playing Sandra was the real-life mother of the actor playing Ste. We were happily surprised to find the film, which I finally have had a chance to see. The film brought back that same emotional rush of our first encounter with the play in Chicago. Beautiful Thing is a positive, endearing and enduring film. The film version makes a few changes and opens the story up a bit, as the medium allows, and the casting of the role of Leah made for a slightly different dynamic in the film. The cast is uniformly excellent, and the scenes between Jamie and Ste are (as many previously have noted) very real and very honest. The Cass Elliott songs add a great dimension to the film as well. The direction is clean, uncluttered and straightforward. Much credit must go to Jonathan Harvey, who wrote a very fine play and then adapted it well for the screen. I wish that there were more gay-themed films like this one - romantic in the best sense of the word and accessible to all with hearts open to love - to help counterbalance the usual portrayal of gay characters as superficial and self-absorbed. I look forward to repeated viewings of this wonderful movie.

For all its faults, in script and plot line, this movie is my all time favorite making me feel good after each viewing (and I've seen it a dozen or more times).  I'll have one of you and a dozen of your mate. The Mammas and Pappas are one of my favorite 60's rock groups and this movie is almost a 90 minute music video for that group.  Amazing too for the reason, that the Mammas and Pappas lyrics were mostly written to explain events in their lives and how well they translate in a different context in his movie.  I simply love the use of Make Your Own Kind of Music (how appropriate are those lyrics to this movie script and what the boys were going through poles apart from California in the 60's) as the two boys run through the park playing catch with each other and then kissing under the tree.  So too, the ending dance scene with Dream a Little Dream of Me and closing credits done to Move in a Little Closer Baby.  Leah playing the Mama Cass role is exceptional.  The script faults are an on-going mystery to me and I can never quite fathom the anomalies they pose - the rainbow colors and lights in the bedroom of a young boy who has just discovered he is gay, why the mother says that Ste might be happy living in a Greek island inhabited entirely by lesbians, why earlier in the movie in an altercation Jamie asks his Mum the question How am I weird? for no particular reason, the double take on Do you have to use words like that? only to get the joke right on the second take, and some rather abrupt looks and words between the two boys that feel out of context or inappropriate to the circumstances.  I've read the script and still cannot fathom the context of these script lines.  But this all adds to the fascination of an incredibly heartfelt story based on unconditional love between a mother and her son, and a relationship of young love that develops between the two boys.  The issues of homophobia are dealt after the credits close.  With the movie ending, we never know how Ste deals with his father's reaction to his public coming out by partnering Jamie in a dance on the common area of the housing development estate.  Fantastic stuff!  It's a pity we are not likely to see a sequel nor that either of the two boys have not taken up major movie roles in the UK.  Move in a little closer baby and make your own kind of music on repeated viewings is all I can say in closing. 5***** out of 5***** for compassion and acceptance on a touchy subject.

Beautiful Thing is a case in point. Life on a London housing estate is neither portrayed as all bad or all good, and the legendary camaraderie of the 'typical' cockney is exposed as being a sham invention of Ealing Comedies and the London tourist board. These people have problems, don't we all, but it doesn't mean they can't recognise a beautiful thing when they see one. This is an ensemble piece that each player can be proud of. It is uncompromising which is often a euphemism for grim. It reveals it's characters as real people , with faults and prejudices. The ending is whimsical but ultimately satisfying, and the expression on Sandra's face as she silently dares the watching crowd to challenge her son, is as powerful an image as I have seen in cinema. A hidden gem-see it.

While other characters battle their own demons (a neighbor girl appears to be obcessed with her admiration for Mama Cass, another teenager is physically abused by an older brother and a drunken single dad, the main character's mom falls in and out of love with a string of boyfriends), the star eventually confesses his attraction to the boy who sleeps over whenever things get too rough at his own place. The opening credits feature a perfectly suited song by Mama Cass. Throughout the film more of her songs beautifully envelop the scenes, the best one by far being Make Your Own Sweet Music. With contemporary British working class backgrounds, the film focuses on the fears of coming out, the social stigma placed on homosexuals, and the growing move for social acceptance. The final scene makes the strong staement be who you are, nothing else matters, and if people don't like it, it's their problem.This is a sweet film throughout. There are a few loose ends and some small details that did not add to the plot, thus should have been cut. I was not comfortable with the implication that the abused teen was a drug dealer, nor that a girl no older than 15 appeared to be promiscuous. These two details were gratuitous and should not have been included. In the end we don't know what becomes of the two lovebirds, nor whether the mother would finally settle down. The man who showed sincere interest in her, was eventually brushed off without a reason. The implication that the mother, too, was gay, is left up to the viewer. The pro-tolerance message is quite clear.

The scene were Ste is first time sleeping in Jamie's bed reflects it brilliantly. Neither of them knows what to say and just sits on the bed, Jamie reading the magazine and Ste eating his sandwich. This particular scene is one of my favorite because it's just so sweet and funny.We don't know that much about Ste. We know that his father and brother abuses him and that he's athletic and more popular than Jamie. But that's about it. In the beginning of the movie when the other boys bullies Jamie, Ste comes along because he doesn't really want to be an outcast or different. It's interesting to follow how he comes braver and accept that he's gay and in love with Jamie. And the scene at the end of the movie - were Ste and Jamie dances in front of a crowd - we really see how he has changed.Sandra, Jamie's mother, is also a wonderful character. I love it how she doesn't play just the mom role - she isn't there simply because the main character needs a mother, she is there to have her own story along Jamie's and Ste's. I really enjoy the scenes were she is - the movie wouldn't be as brilliant as it is without her. She is really fun character and brings the single parenthood's difficulties into the movie. Also I love Sandra's and Jamie's relationship. She is always there for her son. Linda Henry really knows how to act.This movie shows us many things.

All that is an immense chain of clich√©s, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clich√©s if you stick to that and nothing else.But even if this film is full of such clich√©s, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clich√©s to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful.The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it.The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants.The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences.The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU "},{"Title":"Amazing , leaves you with the desire to find someone perfect.","Date":"28 December 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This has to be one of the most amazing and inspiring films I have ever seen.

Not many films have achieved that. Which of us can honestly say that in watching the scenes between Jamie and Ste, that we haven't all felt and thought like they did. True for straights then swap one of the guys for a girl but the effect is much the same.I found it sad that some reviewers thought that the accents were too much and should have been toned down. Hello folks, its London were talking about here. Quite a few of them really do talk like that and lets face it, wouldn't it really be dumbing down. That would ruin the film.I found Sandra particularly well cast and played. There was real emotion between her and Jamie. I only wish that all Mothers and indeed Fathers reacted in such a supportive fashion. True the end of the film was a bit.....over done, but I don't think this detracts from the film in any way. I too, would like to have seen a sequel. I think that for quite a few of us, this film perhaps hit a little too close to the mark about ourselves and hence our desire to see the next part.

Innocent and optimistic despite the fact that it touches on a series of serious issues (bullying - both in the school and home, drugs, coming out...).The story of two young school-friends and neighbours who gradually fall in love is beautifully told. Anyone who has ever fallen hopelessly for another will absolutely recognise the tensions and uncertainties of not knowing if, how and when to tell that person how you feel.You cannot help but like both leads;  Jamie (he's ever so nice) and Ste, who is so badly beaten by his father that he has an even weaker sense of identity than the other characters, who are all soul-searching in their own ways...Jamie seems to have some idea how he feels long before we join the action. It's just as he falls for friend Ste that he realises he is definitely gay and starts to take pride in knowing where he stands. Ste is then left to nervously craft out an idea of who - and what - he is, as Jamie gains the confidence to take the lead in the relationship...After repeated watching you start to notice that residents of the housing project (on which all the main characters live) seem to pop up everywhere. This makes for some lovely linking between situations helping to gel the film together, aided admirally by the fantastic Mama Cass soundtrack... The overall effect is a very well-rounded picture to support the central story of young love.Both Ste and Jamie are played fantastically. Both understated and very sincere enhancing this totally charming story. The actors *should* be stars and certainly shine through magnificently here....Sandra, Jamie's tough mother is feisty and wonderful and  just as confused in her own identity as her son, whom she loves and wants a better life for. Her part too is acted wonderfully, with the staggering pride that instantly shows us that she is a long-term struggler and strong survivor..Particularly good in the supporting stakes are Leah - as the out of control and attention-seeking Mama Cass addict, and Tony (who gets all of the funniest lines of the movie) as the hopeless but devoted boyfriend of Sandra.However the  film is peppered with star turns from all - even the extras!Hell! Even the hanging baskets are perfectly in character!This film withstands repeated viewing. It leaves you with a  warm glow and in unshakable romantic mind. This is the kind of film that disproves the they don't make 'em like they used to theory.They do make them like this...It's just that very few people know how anymore.... ...this film screams out both against the dull Hollywood Meg Ryan romances and against the kind of issue-led hate or anti-hate films that have been the staple of makers of gay films for too long.This film should be enjoyed by gay and straight people alike... It's an upbeat and joyous romance. No more. No less.Anyone who tells you the ending is unfeasibly upbeat is being a killjoy. Who doesn't adore to get up after a film and feel floatily light-headed with a smile on their face?In the words of Candy Statton.............Young Hearts, Run Free.....(and don't you let anyone tell you different!)

Ste gets abused by his father and older brother. Sandra takes Ste in after his older brother beats on him.

After the first viewing, I thought it was great, but not phenomenal. I was bothered by a few very minor things. Regardless, the film made a large impression on me. Over time, the film grew on me. After watching Beautiful Thing for the second time, I found not a single fault within it. (It doesn't matter if you can't understand some of what is said in the film, due to the accents. In fact, it makes the film more authentic, and better). Beautiful Thing is a small, quiet masterpiece.The players in Beautiful Thing are not merely characters. They are familiar, and they are real, and they are family. We see all their different shades; rude, vulgar, dirty, desperate, scared, loving, selfless. They really do struggle; they are living life, and doing their best, and being pushed back three steps for every one they take forward. Some parts are hard to watch, because the emotion is just so genuine. (To be clear I am not saying that this film has the realism of, say, an Italian neorealist film. This is a different type of realism.) Beautiful Thing does not show you what you want to see. It is not an easy film. The story is effortless to follow, but still requires the viewer to think and feel.This is not a film about homosexuality (though Ste and Jamie's relationship is quite touching.) In fact, this film has very little to do with homosexuality. It has everything to do with being human. This is a film about bigotry and ignorance, viewed through one particular lens, but having universal meaning.Thankfully, this lens ain't rose coloured.screenplayisles.blogspot "},{"Title":"Comedy elements reduced by ugly neighbourhood and broken families","Date":"16 September 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" While a teenager, it is also difficult to be different, in spite of country or reason. In a closed and conservative surroundings, having gay feelings is double as different. This is the background of Beautiful Thing where personages have to face different troubles every day; hope for a better life is always there, but poverty and addictions often hinder achieving it.The film is created with a warm feeling and support, and most actors (particularly Linda Henry as Sandra Gangel and Tameka Empson as Leah Russell) are good, but the course of events and the ending are not very realistic - bearing in mind the neighbourhood. Being and showing openly gay is not customary in areas with lots of immigrants and skinheads - or those in question would face serious persecution and violence. And is it really easy for minors to get access to various pubs and have alcoholic drinks? And with such attitudes and ready tongue, how could someone get a better job? Thus, the film is above average, but not a masterpiece to me, the Brits could have created more daring and realistic piece, with protagonists of more colourful types...

Sometimes, it seems, only a few steps would be necessary. That's what happens in Beautiful Thing when Jamie and his neighbor Ste get romantically involved.Only a few decades ago, a number of theories tried to explain the origin of homosexuality. Which is only baffling as one might wonder, why didn't they try to explain heterosexuality? But alas, the heterosexual domain is what constitutes the symbolic order, and thus all other forms of sexuality are bluntly banned or at least discarded.Freud's followers tried to explain homosexuality in the most contrived ways. For example, the absence of a fatherly figure would dangerously wreak havoc in a child's psyche, thus neutralizing the normal course of the Oedipus complex (since there is no father to rival against for the love of the mother, the whole structure falls apart). This sort of theory could be easily applied to someone like Jamie, who has no father and lives with his strong-willed, almost masculine mother that symbolically castrates her temporary male partners.But what happens with Ste? His homosexuality cannot be explained by a textbook approach like the one that so easily fits into Jamie's background. Nor does it need to. And this is what should be considered one of the most important things about this movie. You don't need to explain homosexuality any more than you need to explain heterosexuality. One is just as natural and beautiful as the other.Can gay and straight people coexist? Or there will be constant struggle and friction? Hettie Macdonald's film elicits a possible answer that will only provide the viewer with hope. After all, if an infraction of the Lacanian symbolic order is committed, id est, the homosexual relationship, then it's only logical to deconstruct that symbolic order. Deconstruction does not mean destruction, deconstruction focus in the fissures present in every structure and takes advantage of them in order to rearticulate the symbolic order (society, any given society, is first and foremost a symbolic order, that would constantly readapt and modify depending on the individuals that are part of that society).Jamie and Ste achieve that task admirably. It's a long way, though, from simple friendship, to the first hazed and rushed sexual exploration, to the difficulty in assuming their roles and true sexuality, to the stable relationship they solidify with time and patience.Perhaps the fullest, most powerful, affirmation of the deconstruction of the previous symbolic order is the final scene. I won't spoil it to those who haven't seen it yet, suffice to say rather than a beautiful thing it is a very beautiful moment. Usually I don't like films about hope, as I am rather devoid of such virtue, but I found the end both touching and immensely reaffirming. Sometimes, I guess, it's not to so bad to dream of a world where gays and straight people can, indeed, coexist peacefully.

It's not sappy, is not bogged down by identity politics, and has a great soundtrack to boot. The guys who play Jamie and Ste are so incredible in their acting, and so's the woman who plays Sandra.

It wasn't the best gay themed movie i've seen, for it wasn't terribly dark, moving, or funny.  But, at moments, the film manages to have very moving scenes while at other moments, you're cracking up with laughter.  It treats its subject matter very normally, which is a good thing.  I think this film can be entertaining for anyone--gay or straight and everything in between, for it doesn't strictly concentrate on what it's like being young and gay.  It shares a glimpse of two boys who discover their sexuality in the midst of other subplots---such as dealing with an abusive family situation and having a very eccentric mother....and having to share an apartment complex with some pretty goofy neighbors. Yet, if you are looking for a movie which makes a comment on homosexuality, this film indeed accomplishes that.  I think the moral of the story is simple  these two boys find each other, fall for each other, and deal with the everyday problems of a relationship. Their only problem is having to deal the people who view their lifestyle as sick or twisted.  But the movie never gets too dark and is actually very hopeful, especially at the somewhat moving close.

His next door neighbor (male and the same age) Ste goes along (though with an odd look) with the harrassment.  On his way home he  he passes the black girl Leah (Tameka Empson) with little comment.   When Jamie arrives home, his mother Sandra  (Linda Henry) gives him a hard time for having skipped soccer practice.The stage is set, the main characters introduced, and the story underway in the first sequence in which Jamie walks home from  school.The main plot concerns the developing love affair between Jamie and Ste. Jamie has realized that he is gay, but has told nobody.  He is clearly taken with Ste.  Ste's sexuality is unknown, but seems likely to be heterosexual and he behaves as such. Over the course of the film we find Ste, who starts by joining his peers (perhaps reluctantly) in the harrassment of Jamie, slowly and fearfully  revealing that he does love Jamie and is probably himself gay.Unlike many other films about coming out, this film has some very strong subplots - Ste is being beaten by his father and older brother. Jamie's mother is attached to Tony - he's odd, but clearly cares about her and is (strangely enough) portrayed as one of the most caring people in the movie. She is also working as a barmaid who as an opportunity for a much better position as the proprietor (??) of a pub of her own.  Leah is obsessed with Mama Cass - and is clearly having serious trouble coping with her life.The main subplots concern discordance between people and their environment - Jamie's homosexuality is a problem between him and his mother (and his school peers).  Ste's family clearly (and rightfully) terrifies  him - not in general, but in every moment he is around them.    Sandra has troubles with Jamie whom she clearly loves deeply but also seems generally unhappy. Leah is prone to the kind of adolescent actions that are designed to attract attention (playing her music overly loud, asking to be hit over the head to change her voice and the like) - this affects both her mother and those living around her.Tony is an odd character in all this. His place at the onset is that  of Sandra's boyfriend and they seem nicely settled together.  He works hard to save Leah from one of her more extreme acts.  His reaction to Jamie's coming out is supportive, but only because he seems to think that its the Right Thing.Some of the plots are resolved - Jamie comes out to his mother - though it takes some pressure from his mother who already knows -  to do so.  This scene is likely to be one of the most powerful scenes in the film  for anyone who had difficulty coming out to parents or family.   Sandra gets the new position (though it means she and Jamie will have to move away from the housing (council housing??) where the film is set).  Ste and Jamie end up in love.  Sandra breaks up with Tony (and with such symbolism!).Some are not - Ste's continuing relationship with his father and brother is left open as is his future with Jamie who will move with his mother. Leah's difficulties are completely unresolved.Cinematically, the film is tightly filmed.  Little time is wasted in extraneous shots - the film is not so much about place as about people. Indeed, in a few places, the geography of the locations is not easy to work out.  For the most part shots of the characters are from reasonable distances (balancing psycological distance and identification) - indeed in retrospect its hard to think of many shots that are not in the range of 5 to 15 feet (or so) from the characters in them. This makes the movie feel like you're participating rather than observing from a distance.The Mamas and the Papas music  is featured in the soundtrack and points up Leah's obsession.  The tone of their music is in deep contrast to Leah's agitation.   This contrast emphasizes Leah's position as a crucial character, somehow stuck in her own  permanent anomie as the others find ways to reduce theirs.Don't think this is an intellectual film - much of it is quite emotional - dealing with the kinds of issues each of us copes with - and often seem insurmountable during adolescence.  And then it ends - leaving anyone who has learned to care about any of the characters quite overwhelmed.In the final scene, all the major characters (Jamie, Ste, Sandra and Leah) come together in a overwhelming setpiece finish.  It is quiet  - only the Mamas and the Papas music remains.  It is a surprise, completely unrealistic,  and wonderfully romantic.   It will leave anyone who has been at all emotionally involved with the rest of the film with  a satisfying feeling of completion and that sad/glad romantic satisfaction  that few films manage.

I only just now finished Beautiful Thing, and it seems the only words I can think to describe it best are somewhat good/mostly OK. I had a good time watching it, and thought it was sweet and well-done, though there isn't much that stood out to me when standing back to look at the film from afar.I think one of the things that seemed the most lackluster is that I didn't feel satisfied with the amount of romance or tension between the lead two boys, which made it hard for me to be genuinely invested in how their futures did or didn't intertwine. I remember only one or two truly romantic moments between them where their desire for each other was imminent, one of them happening before the credits roll.I think that may be partially because both of the lead characters are really quite bland, both in writing and acting, and it becomes overwhelmingly apparent when they're in a scene together. I don't see them having a good time together long-term, and to see chemistry or sparks you've got to squint a little.I also found that the dialogue between characters was often hard to read due to the fact none of them seemed like they had really been figured out, thus making relationship dynamic between characters hard to interpret. I wasn't able to figure out what they intended some of the characters to be and their purpose in the film. I'd give the writing a bigger score than the way the film interpreted it(as I'd most likely get a lot more pleasure out of reading a screenplay for this one.)As another reviewer mentioned, there are a few side plots that are nothing short of puzzling in their irrelevant, continuous appearances - but what's worse is that they don't even get proper endings. I think we can credit that to an overuse of comedic relief, which makes me think I might have liked this film a lot better if it were simply drama/romance.Beautiful Thing does have an ending that is spectacularly sweet and homely, which is something unusual to find in films of this sort. It seemed genuine and valuable and it fit the rest of the film's upbeat undertones, tying it together happily with some more of its charming silliness - this is one of the films that make the audience inspired, that make them want to fall in love.In retrospect, most of the things I dislike about the film are things they didn't do at all rather than what they did wrong. I don't think Beautiful Thing is poor in any sense of the word - it just isn't anything particularly special to me either. I'd recommend this to someone looking for a casual, sweet film about two boys who fall in love.

(or was it a channel 4 t.v. film in the UK?)but recently bought it after doing a search on here for something to watch on a Friday night.Firstly, let me say one thing; the story is set in a London housing estate.... the characters are Londoners (this means a variety of backgrounds, ethnic and otherwise), therefore they all have an ACCENT!the film would not work as well if they all trotted out the standard four weddings enunciation.Remember all those in the U.S, not all films have an American origin (forrest bloody gump anyone?) Channel 4 should be congratulated on keeping the roots of the play so well.I agree that some of the plot is a little formulaic(abused teenager, hard as nails mother, drug dealing brother, gay but bullied geek, deep feelings on a gritty landscape) but the actors do a seriously good job with what they were given.The biggest problem I personally have with the film (having not read the play) is that the plot starts too far into the developing relationships and ends too early... as it has been said before, why does his mother end the relationship with Tony? what happens to Ste when his family find out (dancing in the square in front of half the blocks' inhabitants is a bit of a giveaway - why does Ste wait till his dad goes out before ironing his shirt if he is so in love?)what happens to Leah, her mum and Tony? is she possibly a lesbian? does Ste go to the pub with Jamie and his mum? I could quite happily have sat through another 45 minutes of this film in order to tie up the loose ends - a thing this film shares with my beautiful laundrette - it could quite easily have had a sequel in order to follow the boys as they grow up (I honestly thought that the ending would have has Sandra taking on the Gloucester with the boys and their relationship blossoming) Like many plays that are adapted for the big screen, a lot of the essential story has to be truncated and compacted, a lot of the raison is removed or implied and unfortunately this can lead to a disjointed storyline - Beautiful Thing manages to avoid this and still gives a rounded story with what it has to work with. You get the point that Ste bullys his love at school in order to be one of the guys, that Jamie's mum already, in her heart, knows he's gay (what's wrong wiv me?... nothinks wrong wiv ya - you're OK), that Leah figures the boys' relationship out and helps protect Ste from his brothers wrath (when did your Trevor last hit ya? bet it was last Thursday..cos that's when I told him you was sleeping on the couch). The film does have it's wasted time - most of the pub scene, a lot of the estate tracking shots, the problems with Leah on drugs.This could have been better used to show more of Ste's home life and the fact of the boys attraction to each other.In short,this is why I didn't give the film a 10 - a great movie that plays it real without caricature but deals with too much in too short a time, a sequel would be nice... after 10 years maybe?. Not a lot of films can still keep an audience engrossed 12 years after release but this is one of them!

Ste also has an idea what Jamie wants but isn't sure he wants to go there. Fortunately for us, and for the two of them, Jamie takes him there with love, tenderness and understanding, yet, but also with determination. Jamie knows a good thing when he sees it and isn't about to let Ste get away.The point here is that being gay is not just about sex nor just about good looks, but about everything that is involved in a human relationship, about caring and understanding, about bonding and growing, about trust and sharing, and also about allowing each other a little space.Moreover there is a real chemistry on screen between these two actors, so much so that it is hard to believe they are just acting, which is true of very few gay movies.  The shots of their eye contact alone could almost tell the whole story. From their initial 'top-and-toe,' (not top-and-tail, I think) I really believe they are falling in love.I initially thought the closing dance scene a bit much, but nevertheless wanted to stand up and cheer.

Me and a guy I was dating at the time went to see it at a local theatre. It wasn't one of those THX theatres with spotless floors, but the shabbiness of the theatre and the rain outside was quickly forgotten when this exceptional movie took me back in time to when I was a gay teenager growing up and coming to grips with my sexuality.If there had been movies like Beautiful Thing around when I was 15 and 16, I think the depression and isolation I felt on a daily basis would have been much less severe.  With an exceptional cast of actors, and a screenplay exquisitely penned by Jonathan Harvey, a movie with believability and substance was made.  Two boys coming to terms with their feelings for one another contrasted by their troubles at home is the foundation of the film. The ending, a slap in the face of homophobic society, makes you want to stand up and cheer.I have Beautiful Thing on video at home now, and each time I watch it, I grow to love it even more.

Young Ste, his neighbor, is beaten by his father, and comes to sleep overnight. They discover new feelings, sleeping in the same bed.When you are making a gay romance, you run the risk of alienating the straight population. Far too many are just uncomfortable, and this was even more true in 1996 (I am writing this in 2015). But this film is keenly aware of that and focuses on friendship, bonding, and not so much on the sexual angle. That is wise, and actually a rule more films could follow (sex in cinema is almost never necessary).We then populate the story with some interesting supporting characters, and we have a well-rounded look at growing up in a certain part of London.

Needless to say, after I saw it the first time, I rewound it and watched it over again.  Then, I had to run out and get the soundtrack.  A full four years after I bought the soundtrack, I still listen to it at least twice a month.  I guess you could say that this is the film that got me heavily into loving Mama Cass! The music is full and upbeat and always seems to have the sense of a better and a brighter tomorrow just within our reach.My only wish is that I could have seen this film when I was in the process of coming out myself.  The scenes of both Jamie and Ste in Jamie's bedroom are quite possibly my favorites in the entire film.

Why do we need all this teary melodrama over the gay issue? It's like something out of a 1960s b-movie. One boy is predictably less comfortable with his homosexual feelings than the other, and their awkward relationship is exacerbated by their families and mates (one of whom, a black neighbor into Cass Elliot music, is having deep-seated troubles of her own).

The film just touches some real issues, but never delves deep enough into them to make them believable. Ultimately, it eschews truth & insight in favor of light comedic moments & resolutions which are awkwardly positioned in the plot. I felt like the movie was straddling the line between drama and comedy, and because it could not delve completely into either side, ultimately fell flat and became jumbled mush. Not that there is anything bad with mixing genres, but if it is done successfully.I have to commend Tameka Empson as Leah, the Mama Cass loving freak who's tripping her brains out -- the best character in the film. Also Ben Daniels is good, as a compassionate, likeable pot smoking guy with a good heart who is inexplicably & coldly dismissed from the film.I just had trouble believing the actions & reactions of the two leads given the rough, cold social context of the film. I couldn't help but wonder how the film would have been be if we were given the real story of two young gay guys fighting for survival in a brutal environment such as this.I attribute all the positive critics' reviews to a fear of being labeled politically incorrect.
