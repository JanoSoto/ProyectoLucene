It left me wondering why more American films can't be made like this, with subtlety and an eye for simplistic beauty and peace in nature.  The many scenes at night in the rain-soaked city only provide a stark contrast to the scenes with lotus flowers and singing, thus making them more effective and fresh. Above this, the characters were intriguing.  None had a life even remotely like mine, and this is probably likewise for 99% of Americans, who live in a fast-track, needlessly complicated, and mostly material world. Materialism exists in Three Seasons, but is seen as the enemy (the plastic lotus flowers) or (in the case of the prostitute) something to overcome. I left the theatre feeling somewhat wistful that there are not more films like this being produced today.

The result was his 1999 film Three Seasons that walked away with a prize for Lisa Rinzler's cinematography as well as the Best Dramatic Picture Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Performed in Vietnamese with Vietnamese actors, Three Seasons is a series of interweaving stories about loss and redemption in the lives of four characters living in Ho Chi Minh City (though the residents apparently still call it Saigon). Its strength lies, not in its plot or characters, but in the stunning images and dreamlike quality that transports the viewer into a world of sensuous music and soft colors where village women sing while they work, harvesting flowers on a lotus lake.The main and most effective story is about a cyclo driver Hai (Don Duong) who falls in love with a prostitute named Lan (Zoe Bui), He wants to redeem her innocence and dutifully waits for her each day as she leaves her hotel. When they go to a hotel together, he pays $50 from the money he won in a cyclo race merely to watch her sleep, a gesture that allows her to experience the feeling of being loved for the first time. The second story is about a young lotus picker Kien An, a female orphan (Ngoc Hiep Nguyen) who befriends her employer, Teacher Dao (Manh Cuong Tran), and lovingly copies his poems that he cannot record himself because of leprosy. This gesture allows both to touch the poetic quality of life, the teacher for perhaps the last time. The other stories involve a five-year old street urchin named Woody (Huu Duoc Nguen) who braves monsoon-like weather to sell trinkets to tourists in order to survive. When the box containing his wares is stolen, he sets out to find it. This brings him in contact with an American, James Hager (Harvey Keitel) in Vietnam to search for the daughter he left behind when the war was over. This last episode is the least developed of the four and Keitel's performance seems listless in spite of the fact that he is Executive Producer of the film. All four stories come together at the end in a way that ties up all loose ends.Though I am grateful for any look into Vietnam, Three Seasons left me wanting more. It is almost as if Bui was being overly cautious, afraid to say anything about what he saw because of the censors following him around. As a result, his film does not convey a strong sense of time and place, and the neon street signs and glamorous hotels patronized by the rich could be anywhere in the world. Perhaps it is true that the city's culture is being overrun by rampant commercialism, but the director observes this without comment and seems content to offer only a highly romanticized tone poem. Even the city's textures, squalid areas, and chaotic energy are so muted by the use of camera filters that it robs them of their steamy authenticity. Three Seasons is visually striking but left me feeling like a distant observer. I found the characters to be neither fresh nor engaging and the film overly composed, lacking in the poetic vision that turns an average film experience into a great one.

Dao was a handsome poet, who is dying of leprosy. He lost his fingers, and Kien offers herself to write his poetries for him. Hai (Don Duong) is a tricycle-taxi driver, who falls in love for the expensive hooker Lan (Diep Bui). Woody is a homeless little child, working as street peddler of watches, cigarette lighters and other minor goods, who has his wallet stolen. He believes that the thief is James Hager (Harvey Keitel), a former marine who is looking for his daughter with a Vietnamese woman during the war. These three parallel bitter and beautiful stories present in a metaphoric view, the transition of the political and economical system of Vietnam. Professor Dao represents the traditional system, the communism, rotten and dying. Lan is a metaphoric view of the transition to the capitalism, corrupted, aimed and unattainable for most of the poor population. Woody and the little girl represent the next generations of excluded of the new wild system, fighting for the survival and having no perspective in life. James Hager would be the return of the American interests in Vietnam. I am intrigued with the title of this film Three Seasons. The lotus means the spring, the hard rain means the winter; the fallen leaves, the autumn. Where is the summer and why is it missing? Three Seasons is a highly recommended movie, open to the most different interpretations by the viewers.

It is symbolically a film about traveling the historical past and present, put together in four uneven vignettes and how the lives of five people crisscross each other.  Bui is not obtrusive and so his film is gentle and sweet and he lets his actors play out their roles with naturalness and grace.   The gentleness of this film can be both its strength and weakness, because you leave thinking about discrete images beautifully photographed but you don't really have a sense of what Bui was trying to say.  The image of sweat running down the face of cyclo drivers and the red abrasions on naked skin across the woman's back caused by a spoon are just two examples. Also, unlike Western soap opera, he isn't here to manipulate.  Take the old man, Master Dao and his terribly scarred up face and amputations.  Dao could have been afflicted by the after effects of napalm or a land mine explosion but, no, he has an old-fashioned affliction, leprosy.  There is no post-Vietnam hate in Bui. The spirited cycle race through the streets of Saigon descends upon us without much buildup nor dramatics.  We don't realize the significance of Hai winning this race till we see what he does with his winnings.  Perhaps the few times Bui decides he needs to make an explicit statement, he does so with subtlety  the plastic lotus flowers which outsell the naturally grown ones, the opulent, newer hotels rising in Saigon turning the society into truly haves and have nots (what Bui calls the people of shadows), and the hardworking cyclo driver straining to move his vehicle as his Western couple occupants chatter oblivious to his struggles.   The other weakness of Three Seasons is that the four vignettes are so interesting that each could have occupied the entire film. Instead we get incomplete servings from all four and a hunger to know more. Bui spends more time with the cyclo drive and the prostitute and the water lily girl and her poetic master.  The story about the street smart little boy, who is forever in the rainy streets looking for his missing case of trinkets to sell and finding both the case and a tender companion in the end, could have stood by itself.  Similarly, the Vietnam vet who comes back to find his lost daughter because he has to 'right a wrong' is a beautiful piece that needed more detail than what the film provided.  The final scene of Three Seasons summarizes this film neatly - the falling crimson pedals from trees lining a boulevard.  It is picturesque in its beauty but the meaning of it is more effervescent than lasting.

And a moving performance by Keitel clearly searching for his humanity. And a perfect bit of casting with the woman who played his grown daughter.

Basically, each story is about the struggle to survive, both physically and spiritually in an ever changing and modernized society.  Class struggle, the influence from the West (both bad and good), exploitation of children, and corruption of the soul are examined.

That being said, then don't get me wrong, because Three Seasons is a beautiful and entertaining movie.There are several layers and stories told in the movie. Stories that are all connected together. Some better and more interesting than others. Three Seasons tells the story of an American looking for his daughter - this was the least interesting of the stories. It also tells the story of Woody, a street urchin who thinks the American stole his case of tourist trinkets. While this story is better than the searching for the daughter story, it just seemed a bit too shallow. Three Seaons is also the story of Hai, a cycle driver who gives a ride to Lan, a hotel callgirl, whom he ends up falling in love with. This was a good story, albeit quite generic, but this story was really well-told on the screen. And finally, it is also the story of Kien An, a young woman hired to harvest lotus flowers, who end up bringing a glimmer of life back to a reclusive man stricken with leprosy. This was the most touching and beautiful of all the stories told in Three Seasons.Three Seasons does have some really good acting performances by the Vietnamese cast. Ngoc Hiep Nguyen (playing Kien An) stole the screen with her performance. But Duong Don (playing Hai) and Diep Bui (playing Lan) were also putting on very memorable performances.This is a story and character driven movie, so it might come off as a slow and dull movie to some.

After her song catches the ear of Teacher Dao, he invites her to his home where she engages him and starts to write the poetry he has within him. At the same time a cyclo driver collects Lan as a standard fare and, despite her being a working girl, decides to wait for her, quickly becoming practically her own private cyclo driver; however his interest in her quickly becomes love and he tries to break though her tough exterior to find her heart. Meanwhile on the streets of the city, Woody is a street kid selling cigarettes out of briefcase in all weather. It is here where he meets James Hager, an American looking for a daughter he believes he fathered during the war. After meeting James, Woody loses his case and believing James robbed him, sets out to find him. These three stories barely touch but are delivered as all part of the same one in this film.The only thing I knew about this film prior to watching it was that it was the first American film to be made in Vietnam once the embargo was lifted and that inspectors for the Vietnamese government observed the entire process. With this acting as a hook for me, I decided to give this film a stab and in a way I am glad that I did. The film does the well-known technique of mixing together several stories with a vague connection (in this case seemingly flowers or some general meetings between the characters) and this succeeds in making it interesting while at the same time preventing it from really becoming as engaging as it should have been. The stories all have enough going for them to get an audience interesting in the various characters but sadly none of the three stories are original or emotionally involving enough on their own or in combination to make this a particularly impressive film. The three tales all pretty much go where you expect them to, even if some of them are pretty unlikely and unconvincing; it's a shame of course as this could have had a place in history and been really good but instead it is just OK.The thing that will stick in my mind is how good the film looked and most of this is down to the cinematography and the direction of Tony Bui. For all his weaknesses in his plot and script, Bui makes the city look appealing without simplifying or sweetening it &#150; the use of colour is nice but for me it was more enjoyable to see the energy, bustle and depravity of the city itself. For the western audience, Harvey Keitel is naturally going to be the biggest draw but he actually does very little other than be his own reliable self in a minor character. Duong is slightly more impressive and he plays a hackneyed character well enough to make it better than it should have been. However he, like the others, are hampered by the material to some extent. Ngoc Hiep Nguyen is sweet and pretty good; Huu Duoc Nguyen is probably the best thing in the film as he is convincing and never slips into 'cute kid' mode. Bui is alright as Lan but her character is far too simple to really allow her to have the tools to work with.Overall this is an interesting film that is good enough to be worth seeing however it is hard to really ignore how basic the plots all turn out to be and it isn't as emotionally impacting as it could have been. The direction is good and the performances are as good as the material allows them to be but without a better script the film cannot really be more than OK.

As a Vietnamese-American, I was eager to see the first movie filmed in post-war Vietnam.  It was refreshing to see a film about the nation that didn't focus on the war, a flaw found in too many American-made pictures. Overall, I think that Three Seasons was entertaining and touching, with artful direction by Tony Bui.

The story was really good as well, the cyclo driver dude was a pretty spiritually fit guy who accepted his lot in life. If you have surround sound there are a lot of ambient sounds in this movie which helped make it awesome, rain, thunder, street sounds.  I hate subtitles but this movie creates a paradox for me, I can never again say I won't watch a movie with subtitles.  Rent it you will see.

Most of these are by people who still do homework or judge a movie on its body count.  That should clue you as to their attention span.  Whether intentional or not, plot is not the main focus of this movie.  It is languidly paced, reflecting the heat of the Saigon summer it portrays.  Perhaps a tone poem to the city, peeking in on the intertwining lives of some of its citizens.  If you have any interest in this part of the world, check it out.  It is not perfect by any means.  Sure, the lack of character development is a little frustrating, especially the Harvey Keitel character, and some of the plot is familiar, but all of these are minor quibbles with a wonderful, evocative film. Thank god this is not another Focus on the white man in foreign surroundings movie.  I've been to Vietnam twice in the early 90's and enjoyed this update, despite what one reviewer calls inaccuracies.

The sublety of the story , which meanders lovingly in the thick atmosphere of the former Saigon , gives you time to focus on the characters . The film takes long searching looks at each face and explores inner emotions without excessive and unnecessary dialogue . True, the plot leaves many stones unturned but in the end this is the beauty of the film. The fledgling romance between the cyclo driver and the prostitute is especially touching , and the languid pace of the action allows us to absorb this fascinating place and it's people . This is a wonderful movie that doesn't apologize for it's lack of movement but actually basks in it's own self-reflection . Somehow the lives of these small people in a strange and different world far away make  you take a look at your own . If you should watch this film , do it quietly and allow it to take you in.

I felt like I could understand and empathize with the characters even when they weren't fully fleshed out (how fully fleshed out does Harvey Keitel's character have to be--even as a relatively one-dimensional character he has a huge presence onscreen as the allegorical American that had so much effect on the recent history of Vietnam as well as on the history of the movie's characters. everyone in the audience understands this... nothing else is needed).The highlight of the film has to be the cinematography.  I probably would have sat through the entire screening that I saw even if it hadn't been subtitled--I was transfixed.  I left the theater with images that remain with me to this day.  This is not a perfect film, but definitely one worth watching. "},{"Title":"** out of ****","Date":"16 October 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Three Seasons is a film about four different characters and how they meet at different crossroads. The characters are a cyclo driver, a young prostitute, a peasent girl, and an ex- American GI. It sounds great, won all the awards, and looks beautiful . . . . . . that's what I believed when I rented this. Whatever message was trying to be translated here was completely diminished with boredom and obscurity. Some characters are fully developed, if anything, developed way too much, and some are not. A great example of one is the Harvey Keitel character, who was pathetically developed. There was no edge or dimension to him, and soon, he became boring because I just kept seeing the same American drunk looking for his daughter. Now believe me, Harvey Keitel is one of my favorite actors ever. See, that is why this kind of topic is best handled by expert directors, not first-timers. Now I am saying that Tony Bui is a bad director. He has lots of talent and I'm sure he will make some great movies. But this movie just became so uninteresting and very pointless after a while. There were numerous scenes I could recall that were completely unnecessary, whether it was Harvey crying at the dinner table, that dragging, annoying story about the old man with no face looking towards death as poetry with the help of the farming girl, the homeless boy playing soccer, and especially when the cyclo driver was hurting and cutting up the prostitute's back. That was unclear and disgusting. There were just too many elements that couldn't be handled equally enough to make the viewer really feel for the characters. There were so many blurry scenes mixed with beautiful passion, especially with the red leaves falling from the trees. I pitied or didn't like any of the characters at the beginning, like I was supposed to, but after a while, just stopped caring because it either got too fake or pointless. The only real character I liked for almost the whole movie was the cyclo driver and the homeless boy, but as sad as it is, that also went on too long.Yes the photography is beautiful, but parts of it looked way too familiar to Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth. There were some good conversations with the characters, but it was a pity to see Harvey Keitel almost wasted in this film. We knew nothing of him. There are sparks of a good director in the future, but this was not a good movie. I don't know how it won all the awards, but I can tell you that the first 45 minutes of the film could have been summed up in 10 minutes, which means the whole film would have started and finished in about 45 minutes to an hour. I could have finished my homework in the remainder time period, but I guess my ambitions for this film and whether it would move at all were too high.

There's not a lot of plot--or rather there are several very slender plots delicately interwoven.  The delicacy, and the constant subtle irony prevent the movie's use of exceedingly improbable coincidences and relentlessly happy endings from cloying. Neat bits--the name of the bar; the world's most lovely leper colony.  Don't go see this if you are looking for political or social commentary beyond the gentle, constant portrayal of the rich as shallow outsiders.

It takes place presumably, in Saigon, and does give us a view of what life is like in a Vietnam large city. Harvey Keitel lends his name to this venture as executive producer but his actual on screen time is only about 15 minutes. It is acted well and the photography is stunning but much of this film is shot in almost total darkness at times. I found myself wanting the sun to shine more. It is a painfully slow movie at times but the characters are well developed and I found myself interested if not absorbed most of the time.Three Seasons is like reading a novel. If you have the patience,it can be rewarding.

After winning a plethora of awards at the Park City film fest, Three Seasons is the first of the class of 1999 to make it to release.  A delicate portrayal of a people trying to survive in modern Vietnam, first time director Tony Bui has fashioned the slowest film of the 90's.  I don't mean cool David Lynch slowness or even watching-paint-dry fun.  It's a film about (mostly) uninteresting actors doing uninteresting things set in a uninteresting place. Much has been made from the studio about how this is the first film shot in Vietnam since the conflict some years ago.  While undoubtedly a beautiful and thriving city, Bui chooses to shoot the film in the dark, some sequence are almost pitch black.  For all I can tell, this could have been shot in Montreal.  Bui drops the ball big time in his choice of lighting.  This feels like a brighter film with a ton to show off.  Instead the audience has to fight to catch a glimpse of the action. Actor Don Duong and Ngoc Hiep Nguyen give wonderful performances in what ends up being the film's most satisfying story.  The rest of the actors are left to stare into the camera and try to muster meaning.  It doesn't work.  The lone American, Harvey Keitel, is given the most underwritten role.  He strives to make the character's emotional complexity resonate with the crowd, but we are never really sure of his motives - as simple as they might seem. In other movies, subplots like the hooker with a heart of gold or wandering kids would be critically smooshed.  But when this film uses the same clichés, they bestow awards.  Maybe I missed something.  In the year of Blair Witch Project and other Sundance breakthroughs, Three Seasons feels like a bad representation of what the prestigious film festival has to offer. ------ 4 "}]
