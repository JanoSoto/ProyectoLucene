[{"Title":"Glare of the Spotlight","Date":"11 January 2005","Score":"44 out of 48 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Music","Review":" This movie was only a name to me until I saw it last year. Immediately, I was riveted by everything about it. I've always been a casual fan of The Band, and of Levon Helm in particular. However, I'd never been bowled over by Bob Dylan, except as a songwriter, so much of The Band's work remained unknown to me as well. I wouldn't say I've become a rabid fan, but I am much more interested in their work, now.It's a Scorsese film--how could it not be beautifully photographed, but Scorsese managed a difficult feat he keeps himself out of the movie, except as interviewer during those sequences. This is not really Scorese's vision of a rock concert. It happened mostly organically, certainly with mistakes, gaffes and grit. This is part of its charm. There are better singers than the guys in The Band, but few better musicians. This can be illustrated with Robbie Robertson in the Clapton song Clapton's guitar strap comes off and Robertson, with one beat, picks right up on the solo. It looked planned, but wasn't. Joni Mitchell was notoriously hard to back up, due to her original guitar tuning, and ragged song phrasing, but bassist Rick Danko fills in every space with intricate bass figuring. Perhaps we have become too accustomed to the overwrought, over-hyped, overproduced, overexposed, shiny gack that passes for popular music to appreciate the raw, the imperfect, the sheer humanness of this music. Scorsese shows it all. The guys in The Band were largely worn out and sometimes strung out in the interviews. They are tired, scrawny, empty-eyed from the excesses of the road. Rick Danko is hovering on the ragged edge, as his band is dissolved, and he says his goal is to keep busy. Richard Manuel looks lost as he says I just want to break even. These are two musicians who desperately needed the music, but who were murdered by the road. We see their bleak destinies in their eyes in this film. It is bittersweet certainly, but also a moment in time, crystallized into something great by the music, the love of friends, the willingness of the director to simply stand back and allow the music to happen. It also reminds us what good music used to sound like and makes me wish could exist again.

Many use the documentary 'Woodstock 3 Days of Peace and Music' as the ultimate example of a music-doco, but whilst the music in The Last Waltz is actually on par with the great performances of Woodstock (bar Jimi Hendrixthere's no substitute), the thing which elevates The Last Waltz is the photography.This was the first music doco to be shot on 35mm and watching the concert, you'd think that each performance was carefully choregraphed over a few weeks of shooting rather than over one night. Special thanks must be given to Cinematogrpaher Michael Chapman for his efforts on this film. The look of the film is what elevates it's overall appeal, because the music was always going to be epic, especially with the cavalcade of great names performing. This is just great filmmaking from contemporary cinema's most accomplished filmmaker. And how about that haunting theme that both starts and ends the film. Just great.

Let It Be'? Forget that too. This is, truly, THE greatest rock and roll film ever made. Why? Well, try for a moment to forget that the actual performance itself features the great artists it does (including The Band) and focus on the film itself.This film is shot in 35mm format which gives the picture pristine look (as opposed to all other previous rock films, which were shot on 16mm). But it's not just a spralling work, this is also well executed as well. By that, I mean the production value is outstanding. The lighting is unlike any rock concert I've seen (and I've seen many). The camera work is top-notch (apparently it was done by the best in Hollywood at the time). It's also easy to see that a great deal of planning went into the production. Other concert films (Woodstock, Monterey Pop) suffer from a last minute scramble look that simply isn't there with Waltz.Add to that the shear magnitude of what The Band had undertaken. Imagine learning, arranging and performing so many songs in so many styles by so many artists in one night with only one take of each allowed. When that is taken into consideration, you have to have a degree of respect for them. Of course, I'm bias. I'm Canadian, as were 4/5ths of The Band.My only critique would be a technical one. It seems Rick Danko redubbed all of his bass playing. Whether this is attributed to a technical problem or unhappiness with his performance is unclear. However, what is clear is that what you hear the bass doing in the audio and what you see on the screen are completely different.

In a salute to WALTZ'S director Martin Scorsese, the film aired on TCM over the New Year's weekend. I hadn't seen it or thought about it in 25 years. And all I can say is that it hasn't lost any of its power. (And this from someone who's never been to a live rock concert.) The stars of the film- the all-purpose backup and touring band called 'The Band-' give a simple but enlightening insight to the mechanics of their 16 years on the road and how their Thanksgiving Day final concert in San Francisco turned into a revival-like celebration. Even though I grew up on jazz music more so than rock, I can fully appreciate The Band's intense, immense music background- influenced by everything from blues to country to folk music. As for the concert itself you have the likes of Neil Young, Ron Wood, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Muddy Waters, and Dr. John (who gives a standout, honky-tonk performance of Such A Night,) kickin' it on stage before it's all over. And if these live performances weren't enough, there are additional performances done on a sound stage with artists that weren't part of the live show woven into the 117-minute film a fabulous folk/gospel jam session of the song The Weight teamed with the Staples Singers (lead by Mavis Staples, who sounds very Gladys Knight-like) and about thirty minutes later shifting gears into the lovely folk ballad Evangeline, replete with fiddle, mandolin, and acoustic guitar from Emmylou Harris. Also cool is Muddy Waters bluesing on Ain't that a Man, and the finale with all the artists of I Shall Be Released. You just might be.

The guest artists that also played with the band really did bring the house down and with Martin Scorses's direction and great sound engineers this will undoubtedly go down in history as the greatest live rock/music video ever. I wish i had been around back in 76' for that concert man. Sad to see that Rick and Richard have passed away but glad that their talents have been captured on film for the world too see how good these guys were.

It's more personal than Woodstock and, in my opinion, the music is infinitely better than any other rock documentary made to date. Apart from the intensely talented men of The Band, musical greats like Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, and (of course) Bob Dylan play some unforgettable performances. Do yourself a favor and watch it. It's a concert performed by inspiring, talented musicians; it's what we all need in this time of musical uncertainty.

There is no word that can be used to describe The Last Waltz better than 'celebration'. This is a celebration of The Band, and of music, specifically American music, which The Band loved and played so many styles of.The Last Waltz is a concert film, and there's a common sentiment outside of the rock fan community that such films can never be true art films. If proof exists that this is not true, The Last Waltz is it. The film is brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese, who captures this incredibly powerful and remarkable performance with skill that can't be described as anything other than amazing. This film looks absolutely stunning. What else can one ask for other than a film that looks pristine and beautiful, and contains some of the best music ever written? Scorsese is a smart filmmaker and knows that he could add to the film by including short interview segments with the members of The Band, all of which are relevant to and enhance the film.The beauty of The Last Waltz is its simplicity. The Band were probably the most unpretentious major musical group there has ever been. They were interested in nothing other than playing good music, and Scorsese, at least in this instance, is not interested in doing anything other than creating a simple, true document of a memorable, great musical event. That's what he does, he captures a brilliant concert where the addition of celebrity musical guests does not cheapen it at all, but makes it a true celebration of music. Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Joni Mitchell, Neil Diamond, Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Neil Young... the list goes on and on. Phenomenal musicianship, phenomenal film-making, a phenomenal film all around.

The music is fantastic, the performances are good, and Scorsese's overall intent is subtly presented. As the title suggests, this is a filmic record of The Band's final performance, but more importantly it is a window into the coming decline of contemporary popular music. It is the last stand of the glory days of old. The various performers that you see on stage are in the latter days of their once great careers, and even though many would continue on for years, even decades to come, the central premise that the late 70s was really the 60s on its deathbed rings true. This is especially notable in the various interviews, where we notice that the musicians themselves seem quite oblivious to the reality that their time is all but up in terms of their importance or prominence to the public. Robbie Robertson is asked by Scorsese if he thinks this is the end or not. Robertson replies that it is the beginning of the end of the beginning. As the 80s would rapidly prove, Scorsese's thesis is accurate. The period that followed would prove to be less creative musically speaking but for a few bands like U2, etc., who would survive the downturn in the quality of the music that came out of that later period. Scorsese presents the music that he loves played by the principle people that we admired. In light of the transition that was taking place from disco and new wave to rap and worse, this film is more than a footnote to a once proud and glorious musical heritage. Don't listen to the detractors. Watch the movie, and listen to the performances. It is not the greatest film of its kind - I would rather watch The Song Remains the Same - but it is what it is, a film of the times made by a man who had sensitivity to the times, on time! Very often we don't notice that something is lost until after it happens. Scorsese noticed while it was happening, and that by itself is quite astute of him, and puts him in a league with journalists who have their ear to the ground.

This is certainly not the case.The idea of the Band in my opinion was for them to be a band with five equal members.  Mr. Marty Scorsese obviously didn't think so.  He must have been under the impression that the Band was a star vehicle for Robbie Robertson, like history has written, and not the group of equal musicians that slowly waltzed out of Big Pink.Like Levon Helm said in his book the band was based on the heart and soul of Richard Manuel, the genius of Garth Hudson, the songwriting of robbie robertson, the hopping rythm of Rick Danko's bass, all pulled together by the tight rythms of Levon and Richard.  On top of all that the three best vocalists in rock music, none of which are robbie robertson.Even though half of the film is robbie singing his heart out from behind his ever changing Hollywood wardrobe, he is singing into a microphone that was turned off.  Meanwhile you hear an amazing voice that comes from nowhere that you assume to be his but it belongs to the late Richard Manuel who is made to look like a clown in this movie.As far as Scorsese's interview segments go you've got four guys who don't want to be where they are talking about some things they don't want to talk about with an interviewer that they couldn't care less if they never saw again.  Then you have robbie robertson trying his best to turn the interview segments into a Hollywood career (which must have come to a complete halt when everyone saw his performance in the Crossing Guard).It's a shame that this is how these folks are remembered, on screen at least, when footage exists of much finer concerts in Japan (Without robertson)that were never officially released.  Part of the reason for this is that the rest of the Band didn't have the love for business and money that robertson pumped into the Last Waltz.  With the exception of Manuel (who hung himself on a shower rod after a modest turn out at a small venue) the rest of the Band would've been happy playing anywhere for the rest of their lives.  And basically, they all did.Sorry if this got a little off track.Buy the albums starting from Music From Big Pink before you ever watch this movie!

Annecdotes are present throughout the film and are an absolute treat to watch.The one interesting thing I noticed, though, is that the audience is never seen (and only heard sporadically).  Scorcese did a fabulous job of leaving this staple of live music out to focus on The Band and give the film a very intricate and personal feel to it.  Even though The Band called it quits from touring (after 15 years) with this Last Waltz, it is easy to tell how much they enjoyed the road and how they all are ready for a change in lifestyle.

I had not seen The Last Waltz since 1978 when I saw it at the college campus theatre with the worst possible picture and sound.  At the time I thought it was OK and slightly interesting to see the list of guest performers.  The 2002 re-release is FANTASTIC.  The enhanced visual and audio are wonderful.  Watching Muddy Waters quiver with emotion, Eric Clapton's fingers flying across the neck of his guitar while Robbie Robertson struggles to keep up, and Neil Diamond on the cusp of his middle-aged women/all arena two decade tour trying desperately to fit in with the real musicians all make this worth the price of admission.  What a joy to see Neil Young (with Joni Mitchell on backup) play Helpless and seem to be having such a great time.  While all the anger now Neil?  This may be the last time Bob Dylan actually sang his songs.  Now he just whines nasally.  The real showstopper is Van Morrison belting out Caravan unlike any other. Watch for all of the onstage dynamics of an unrehearsed concert.  Quite a difference from 'n Sync!!  My favorite part is watching Robbie Robertson manuever for maximum camera time.  He has always been the male Streisand ... desperate for privacy, but the ultimate promoter.  Watching Scorcese interview Robertson at the beginning is very insightful.  Robertson constants wants him to ask that one again so he can provide a better answer.  Just a mesmerizing couple of hours that is well worth your time even if you never really understood The Weight.

With the years, I think, the film has become more important, keeping some of these performances on record is important from a historic standpoint, Muddy Waters leaps to mind. I think, in a sense, this was a Last Waltz for the youth of these rockers, many continued to do great work, some did not, but most were really saying goodbye to the hazy, crazy days of the sixties once and for all. So it's touching from that standpoint. So mostly, if you love these performers you will love the film, and vice versa.

Blues is also about  order, slightly but emotionally and predictably outside of order. They are both like a bad  marriage -- charming at first but tedious in the long run. Country music and its incarnation in folk was then about storytelling. Some time around  '66 Bob and Paul and John (and Brian and some others) started writing music cinematically. Some of the Beatles songs come from directly movies 'All you Need is  Love is from South Pacific, for instance. But all of the later Beatles songs and Dylan  songs from this period (beginning with Tambourine Man) started life as cinematic  visions, stories in pictures translated into lyrics and energy. For a good while there, cinematic music was a strong contender for our imagination in  the music marketplace, with The Band as the lead vehicle. That's in part because of the  mix of Garth Hudson and Levon Helm. Garth is all about discovered disorder. He calls it  jazz because something similar often happens there, but disorder in the popular media  is something else Garth's vocabulary is all about lyrics with unexpected emphasis of the ordinary. It is blues outside the lines allowed by the tradition and jazz within street  signs. It is beat made pretty. His inspiration is John Ford's innovation Ford took a dull,  bad cowboy actor and taught him how (in Stagecoach) to utter his lines with an  unexpected cadence. Thus began a tradition of performance jazz in film acting which  Garth adapts and exploits. Helm is a storyteller, from a family of storytellers. The two, Helm and Hudson, together  have crafted a novel and lasting entry in the art of cinematic music stories whose  rhythms in telling are different enough that they establish a sort of aural camera. The  other members of the band are talented enough, but act primarily as transferral agents  from other innovators and traditions rather than innovating themselves. Dylan was the primary experimenter in our age of language, mostly in sounds rather  than cadence, until he met The Band while recuperating from a near-death experience.  When he tied in with them, magic happened stories, cadence, poetry, merged, all  cinematically rooted -- and it transformed us all. Every one of us of a certain age passed  through the portal of this music, following the progress through underground copies of  the basement tapes and nearly unreadable late generation xeroxes of stolen galleys of Tarantula. (This tradition of cinematic music with disordered cadence has been abandoned by the  later Dylan, even in singing older songs. It is continued and extended in its pure form by  Joni and Van, and was picked up as goofy irony by The Police, Talking Heads and some  Genesis. But it is now all but dead and has been appropriated as soap opera by today's  so-called country music. This concert was the end and we all knew it, even then.  Compare the novel, odd phrasing of the recording of Forever Young to his earnest but flat phrasing here. Is it his conscious surrender, or something else?) As with music, so always with cinema there was a similar battle in the world of film for  control over our imagination. The notion of character-informed rhythmic storytelling was  led by Scorsese (and Coppola). It is a deeply Italian tradition, as compared to more  layered and experimental narrative traditions. That's why Scorsese wanted to do this and  why he succeeds so admirably it is cinematic music finally expressed in cinema, his  variety of cinema. It is his only successful story. Is this the best concert film? Yes, in fact it may be the only honest film of a concert  possible because the songs come to the film as the film comes to them. They probably  never will again.

My mum was watching The Last Waltz on A&E, as I recall, and she made us watch it with her, saying, OK, you kids want to be musicians, then you need to see this! We had no idea who any of these performers were...hell, to us Bob Dylan at that time was just the guy who'd smoked up The Beatles! Well, I was impressed then, even though it took me about another ten years or so to get into The Band, Dylan, Neil Young, etc (all of whom are among my favourite artists today.) The Last Waltz is, of course, Martin Scorsese's documentary of The Band's final concert, at Winterland in San Fran, on Thanksgiving 1976. After sixteen years of being on the road, with all the hard living and extra baggage that that entails, they'd decided to pack it in (or at least Robbie Robertson had, as history has shown.) And they decided to go out with a bang, inviting practically all of their musical associates to join them Dylan, Young, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Ronnie Hawkins (who had, after all, given them their first big break years and years before), Van Morrison, Muddy Waters and even Neil Diamond, to name a few. Probably the greatest pre-Live Aid gathering ever on one stage. So you can be guaranteed that music will be top notch; aside from The Band's own classics (The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down; The Shape I'm In; Ophelia; It Makes No Difference...even a new studio-shot version of The Weight featuring The Staples Singers) you get Dylan doing Forever Young, Neil Young's Helpless, Joni Mitchell's Coyote, Van The Man's Caravan...a veritable 70's California rock wet dream.Ah yes...the seventies...as timeless as the majority of the music performed at The Last Waltz is, practically everything else about it just screams 1976. Especially the costumes lots of bellbottoms, butterfly collars and plaid on display. Richard Manuel, The Band's pianist (R.I.P.), and Don Cherry must have the same tailor, what with their taste for tacky suits. Along with the 70's clothes is the 70's cocaine, with which this concert just reeks of (I practically get a coke buzz just watching it, and I detest cocaine!). Apparently Scorsese and Robertson spent quite a bit of their own money just to rotoscope a big chunk of blow hanging from Neil Young's nose. To their credit, as high as EVERYBODY involved seems to be, the performances are great (even if, according to Levon Helm, The Band's drummer, a lot of post-production overdubs took place...I've heard the bootleg of the actual concert and you really can't tell.) For what makes The Last Waltz so special is how well The Band meshed and their onstage interaction. Here were five guys who were utterly simpatico with one another musically...if there is a such thing as musical mindreading, these guys could do it (which explains how they could back up Bob Dylan so well). In my opinion, the only other band that comes close to this kind of interaction is Led Zeppelin...and arguably The Band pulled it off better. The sum indeed made up more than the parts, which makes the Helm-led 80's reunions such a letdown.Having said that, the biggest drawback to The Last Waltz is how it is more or less presented as The Robbie Robertson Show. Sure, Robbie's a hell of a songwriter and guitarist, but it cracks me up to no end watching him sing into that unplugged microphone ('cos the man can't really sing...at least not compared to Manuel, Helm or Rick Danko, whose performance of It Makes No Difference is, for me, the song of the night). Robertson gets the most camera time, both onstage and during the interviews, though the other four guys have their share of insights as well during Scorsese's interviews (even if Danko is stoned silly and Manuel is hammered.) Still, The Last Waltz is Robbie's trip just like Let It Be is Paul McCartney's show.Still, all told, The Last Waltz -and The Band in general- is really musician's music, and deservedly so. Heh heh...one of my exes, who is not musically minded, watched The Last Waltz with me once and couldn't understand all the fuss (she complained a lot of the music was too slow.) Are you nuts?! I said...we broke up not long after, actually. I still make it a point to watch this film at least four or five times a year, and always ask myself, What the hell has happened to popular music since then?...my musical era, with only a handful of exceptions, ends at about 1980...I have no tolerance for nowadays greed-motivated pop CRAP. Artists like The Band epitomize artistic integrity, which seems to be as dead as John Lennon these days.By the way...the fact that The Last Waltz was directed by Martin Scorsese, probably the greatest filmmaker of modern times, is just a great big bonus! Marty's got impeccable taste in music...I'd love to check out his record collection.

The only comment I want to make is about all the negative comments about Neil Diamond. I am not a big fan of his or anything, but I enjoy some of his material. If you watch the film closely (and pay attention), Robbie Robertson explains the reason Neil was invited to perform was that they both got their start as struggling songwriters in Tin Pan Alley in the early 1960's. Their music styles may have gone off in different directions, but it is the same as renewing a high school friendship at a reunion, when your lives are now different. Don't put him down. It was a good performance (Dry Your Eyes), and not one of his real pop numbers. As far as the actual shooting of the movie, one of my favorite parts is the side shot of Robbie and Rick as they sing Up On Cripple Creek and the lens switches focus on each guy.

It was the most obvious choice to choose the Winterland, since it was the first place The Band made their solo debut without their original front man Ronnie Hawkins and later Bob Dylan.     The concert was to be a small event which later got bigger and bigger.  The Band got Ronnie Hawkins to appear for the show, as well as Bob Dylan.  Other big name acts followed, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Dr. John, Neil Diamond, Muddy Waters, Ron Wood, and Ringo Starr.  This small event turned into something more meaningful, and Robertson had a excellent idea to document this special event and have Martin Scorsese be in charge of it.        THE LAST WALTZ is the name of the final concert for The Band, and the name of the film.  It features the concert performance at the Winterland, some interviews with each member of The Band discussing their history and telling stories, and features three masterpiece footage of the Band performing on a MGM studio soundstage where Scorsese had control to use track shots and rotating track shots.        Along with WOODSTOCK and LET IT BE, THE LAST WALTZ is one of the best rock n' roll documentaries ever!  It has the energy and excitement that one would have after attending a concert in person.

Scorsese and Robertson defend that complaint with, this movie is about the concert, not the people.  And that is true.  Why would anyone want to watch the audience during a live concert.  When I watch a show, 85% of the time I'm watching the performer, 15% I would talk to the person that I am with sharing that experience.  I don't watch other people, and that was a very clever move on Scorsese's part, which makes you feel that you are watching the concert.        The performances are outstanding.  If your feet are tapping along with the beat by the Band's second song, Up on Cripple Creek you might want to check your pulse.  Another standout live performance by the Band is, Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.  The performances by the guests are also good.  Dr. John's Such A Night is enjoyable, Bob Dylan's Forever Young is well done (although he should have given second thought for his wardrobe), and Van Morrison's Caravan also gives out an impressive amount of energy.     But I found three performances in the film that stood out, one was live, the other two were filmed for the movie.  Neil Young's Helpless shows that Young had just as much energy then as he does now, which is what makes him one of the best musicians ever.  As for the two audience absent performances that were filmed at MGM studios in Culiver City, it might not have the cheers and hooting that a audience would give, but they are just as powerful.  When The Band performs their signiture song, The Weight with The Staples, you are entertained by not only the song, but by the way Scorsese has the camera move around the stage and edits a different memember of The Band at approprate times with the song.  The other excellent song was the then new Evangeline which The Band performed with Emmylou Harris.  The tracking shot showing the members of The Band playing different instruments, and Harris singing with them to such a beautiful song would give any person goose-bumps who is watching.  And it shows that The Band was highly talented by not only playing their usual instruments but by having drummer Levon Helm who usually plays the drums playing the mandolin and paniast Richard Manuel playing the drums and later the slide gituar.      For anyone who loves music, filmmaking, or documentaries, THE LAST WALTZ is a definite classic!  And for those who love the music of The Band or any of it's guest musicians, would also love it as well.  Had Alan Parker actually shot the live concert footage of Pink Floyd's THE WALL and released it, that would have been the best concert movie ever.  But since it wasn't, this film is a very exceptional subsitute.

Here are my favoritesThe Band are at their best the wistful out of this world ,the harrowing it makes no difference and the duet with Emmylou Harris (Evangeline) are particularly exciting perhaps because they are not among their best known staples such as the night they drove old Dixie down or the weight.Although Neil Young did not like his performance ,I love him whatever he may do;and his cover of Ian Tyson's Four strong winds makes sense cause both Young and the Band are Canadians,but it was not in the film.On the other hand his helpless is at least as good as the original he made with CSN .(I must admit I'm not a fan of CSN)I do not go much generally for Joni Mitchell's stuff but here she delivers the goods;her Coyote  is peppy,jazzy and I wish she had done Amelia too.Van Morrison is musically closer to the Band than anyone else on the stagethe first time I had listened his moondance album,I mistook it for a Band album.A great artist,a great song Caravan.On the other hand ,his cover of a traditional fails to excite me cause there are so many great songs in his own catalog he could have performed.My favorite moment is Dylan's fiery Baby let me follow you down .My Lord,what a singer! The Band perfectly segues from this traditional into I don't believe you although the Rhino reissue of the record on four CDs four years ago reveals that they performed Hazel just after Baby...Forever young and I shall be released  climax the concert.A note about the previously unreleased tracks on the 2002 editionit could have been boiled down to a three-CD set cause the concert rehearsal ,the studio ideas (sic) and the jams could have stayed in the can.But there are plenty of good songs we do not hear in the filmoutside Four strong windsand Hazel ,there is Clapton's all our past time Mitchell's Furry sings the blues the Band's Acadian Driftwood (J'Ai Le Mal Du Pays =I've got homesick blues)and more..Martin Scorcese bows to no one,when it comes to direct a rock film.

It was. Martin Scorsese puts on the opening credits of this film This Film Should be Played Loud. Well yeah, it's a concert and all but what's with the urgency for volume. This ain't a Bon Scott AC/DC show. The Band were four Canadians and a guy from Arkansas that embraced a mix of country/folk/blues/rock and projected an earthy, folksy, backwoods persona. To further complicate the Band's image Scorsese brings in production designer/set decorator Boris Levin who did West Side Story and The Sound of Music to create this ornate atmospheric elaborate stage setting that seems so ingenuous to the music of the Band. It comes across like the Dixie Chicks being invited to Mozart's house. ( well, after all it is the Last Waltz, good thing they didn't call it The Swan Song.) Niel Diamond is here and after you get over asking yourself what's he doing here, he actually is one of the better performances. Ringo Starr, Ron Wood seem a little out of place. Bob Dylan and Ronnie Hawkins are naturals since the Band served as the backup band to both performers during their 16 year career that began in 1960 and ends on Thankgiving of 1976 when this concert was filmed. Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Paul Butterfield, Dr John, Muddy Waters, Emilou Harris and The Staple Singers are among the performers. Cinematographer Michael Chapman who photographed such feature films as The Last Detail, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull leads up a team of photographers of Lazlo Kovacs, Vilmos Zsigmond, Bobby Byrne, Michael Watkins and Hiro Narita. It's beautifully photographed but concentrates too much on Band member Robbie Robertson and too little on Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel. Noted director Martin Scorsese made this film between two of his biggest features Taxi Driver and Raging Bull and it was filmed while he was working on the film New York, New York. Interviews with the band and other musicians are interspersed among the performances. It's a good document from the mid-seventies of a collection of musicians who got their start in the 60's but over rated by many. I would give this a 7.5 out of 10.

I am disappointed though by the portrayal of Robertson as the leader of the band. He may have penned the lyrics to the majority of the songs, but that is as far as his leadership goes. Since this movie was entirely his idea and since he was the band member who is friends with Scorcese, he is shown to be the conductor. The truth is, the sound of the band comes the least from Robertson. His microphone is seldom even turned on because he has such a poor singing voice. Also note that all of the music, vocals and instruments, besides Helm's voice and drums were overdubbed for the film and the soundtrack.Either way I really do enjoy this film immensely. Two stars were compromised by the misrepresentation of The Band thanks to Robertson and Scorcese, as well as the fact that the true music from that night is not to be found anywhere.

It's screamingly obvious on a couple of the blues numbers, he's just thumping away on one note while the bass you HEAR is doing climbs and drops.. you know, professional.So I don't know what was up with his playing, and I don't know if there was a ringer offstage or whether they overdubbed bass in a studio later (i.e. they recorded the audio to a 24-track).But I swear, Rick Danko was NOT playing the bass you're hearing.MY THEORY Eric Clapton was around all evening, and played several times. His bass player from Derek and the Dominos, Carl Radle, mysteriously showed up during the one 'all star' jam that got filmed..

But the story as to how the Band broke up and the future was very controlled and manipulated on Robbie's part...which is a crying shame. If the whole movie wasn't so biased in point of view and showed more of the rest of the Band...it would be a 10...unquestionably...However, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who truly appreciates rock 'n roll.

But it's certainly not the fault of The Band.  All of the members are given a chance to address Scorsese and his camera, although the focus is clearly on Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm (and that makes sense, because they are the most famous members).  They seem to be high on something for most of the backstage scenes, but this was filmed in 1976, so that should come as no surprise.  Was it just me, or did the members look like Stillwater in Almost Famous?   What you take away from the movie, though, is not the backstage material, but the performances.

They are incredible musicians and arrangers who fill the spaces between guest performances with their outstanding work. One of the highlights comes away from the actual concert--that is Emmylou Harris doing a rendition of Evangeline with the Band in the background, featuring Levon Helm harmonizing, shot in a cold kind of lighting, mysterious and a contrast to the festive being of the concert. It fades off and the applause comes up. It is quite eerie.I really enjoyed Neil Young--his manic presence and the haunting voice on Helpless. I can't wait to get this on DVD.

And some of the individual performances are terrific, which live shows do not guarantee. Getting unadorned footage of Neil Young or Joni Mitchell is great, and lots of different songs by the Band itself, excellent for what it all is.But as a movie, something to sit and watch and get involved in? Not a chance. The interviews were really really boring even for someone like me prepared to be fascinated. And there is a lot of it, people sitting around talking about how really great the music was and how the concert was meant to be more than just music, but a celebration, blah blah. My god, these are adults talking! Ha...so full of themselves, and Scorsese, a great director, seems sucked into the rock star worship, too, forgetting to film it, edit it, and make it more than just another rock and roll concert film. Which is what it is.As a quick comparison, you find something similar in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense which is better just by virtue of being more polished and devoid of silly interviews. And there's Woodstock, which has a whole other level of historical interest. Maybe there was a feeling The Last Waltz was in fact an historical moment, but not really, not for anyone except, maybe, the Band. You all know who you are. If you love the music, you'll love the music. The interviews are hard to imagine liking more than once, if that, but the music is what it is. I'd recommend the CD.

The same can be said of 'The Last Waltz' and the music of The Band in general. If you don't like The Band, forget all the rest because, compared to The Band, the rest is, to varying degrees, a step down.All the good stuff has been said more eloquently than I could so I will just make a couple of comments. In the movie, Robertson pretty much laid it on the line as to why he was breaking The Band up he couldn't take life on the road anymore. Yes, I am sure he has an ego and who doesn't? But who can fault a man for wanting a normal life? And then there is Rick Danko. Has there ever been a more endearing performer in the history of rock 'n roll? And yet, he was addicted to drugs and died before his time. Think of the emotional energy that they were required to put out for every gig and then think of 100 or so gigs per year for 16 years. Is it any wonder that they needed to wind down afterward? It was and is an inevitable component of this type of music and a pretty good base from which to argue that, for all of its beauty, it probably would have been better had rock 'n roll never happened. All the art in the world is not worth one human life.

Although drummer Levon Helm slams it in his book This Wheel's On Fire, this is a masterpiece. The flaws that Levon points out are evident after several viewings, namely too much screen time given to the somewhat sleazy Robbie Robertson. Besides that, this film is perfect. I would have liked to see more screen time given to the other members of The Band, as they seem like much more likable characters. Good ol' boy Levon Helm, eccentric genius Garth Hudson, drunk as hell Richard Manuel and the youthful, upbeat Rick Danko. But, apparently Scorsese had a little man-crush on Robertson and he makes him appear to be The Band's leader. When you watch the whole Band together, however, in interviews and onstage, the leadership role suits Levon more. When he talks, the other guys shut up. With only one serious mis-step, the Neil Diamond cheese fest Dry Your Eyes, this is just about the greatest film ever made about the power of music. Even with too much Robbie.

Even more important here is a group of musicians who were on the road for years, working clubs and bars that had a chance to become a success due to their musical ability not what company they were with.  Not one person in this concert could become a success today.  Imagine any member of The Band, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and any of the other players, on this special night, trying to make it in the business today.  These people were not placed together to saturate a demographic.  They were not assembled for a particular look to please the 12 to 15 year old female audiences.  They were not a promotion by a record company or radio conglomerate to build up a profit base in a particular section of the country who haven't been buying enough records of a particular type in the last three months.  These are a bunch of guys who got together to play music, get laid and party and are thrilled that you could come along for the ride.  This is a look back on what was going on before music was a global business that completely controlled what was to be deemed talent.  I didn't mean to use the context of a movie review to spout off about what is going on today in the music business but the whole time I was watching I was plagued with the idea that the future generations would not have a Bob Dylan or Robbie Robertson to take inspiration from.  Can the Backstreet Boys inspire you with their musical ability or Britney Spears, who can't even perform live, make you want to learn an instrument?  I'm sure that there are many new talents, Alicia Keys and Creed come to mind, (both of whom were rejected by every major label) out there but will they get the exposure to effect the future as these people did; only time will tell. This DVD release came out when there is a `revival' of the older 70's and 80's bands so it is actually timely.  The reason of course for this revival of `oldies' is because there is so little in the way of creative music going on now and the copyrights have run out on the songs so for the most part the cooperations rake in all or most of the revenues from these greatest hits copulations.The movie itself was a great mixture of interviews and the concert itself.  The interviews were some single and some group but all very short glimpses into the character of each of these persons as part of the band.  There were two songs that were done in the studio that really emphasized the roots that this music came from, Gospel (Staples) and Country (Harris) but both of these went with the flow.  This is a concert of `imperfect' music with a sound from ordinary folks playing songs that most anybody with some guitar training could master quickly.  This was a celebration of music, like Dave Mathews is now and the Grateful Dead were for so long.  This was an affirmation that this band, as a total, was certainly greater that each of its parts.  A great way to spend an evening with a six-pack, a pizza and your system turned up loud.

It's got fun little stories like the band stealing baloney when they were struggling and broke. The concert film is expertly done especially for the era. The interviews are pretty straight forward without much flash. One could mistake this for Robbie Robertson and His Band. Robbie is in most of the interviews and is showcased for the film.

Not just The Band, but Bob Dylan, Dr. John, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, and more. But if you do enjoy this type of Seventies rock/blues this is one of the better concert films I've seen. Of course Martin Scorsese probably has a lot to do with that. Apparently the filming was well-planned with a full crew, not just pointing a camera at the stage and letting it run. That can work well, too, sometimes, but this was masterfully done. Particularly interesting was Levon Helm, singing the songs he wrote while playing drums. While it was sad that The Band was breaking up, most Sixties and Seventies rock band that have kept on plugging, are not at all good anymore. Stones and The Who, I'm looking at you.

The Last Waltz was a concert by that Canadian rock group the Band, held on America's Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, at Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. It was advertised as the Band's farewell concert appearance, and the concert saw the Band joined by more than a dozen special guests, including Paul Butterfield, Neil Young, Emmylou Harris, Ringo Starr, Dr. John, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Muddy Waters, Ronnie Wood, Neil Diamond, Bobby Charles, The Staple Singers, Eric Clapton, as well as two artists the Band was actually the back-up band for at one time- Ronnie Hawkins, and later Bob Dylan. The event was filmed by director Martin Scorsese and made into a documentary released in 1978.I read all kinds of stories about the goings-on with this concert- the clashes between front men Levon Helm and Robbie Robertson, the legal issues that came up with Dylan's appearance in the film, and all that cocaine??!! LOL Apparently Neil Young's nose was covered in it in a shot, which was later edited out of the film-??? Director Scorsese even admitted he was a cocaine addict when he shot this film. And just a heads-up apparently this movie is now streaming on Netflix and there have been some issues with the audio during the interview scenes between the performances. I heard this may have had something to do with some legal issues, but not sure-??-and not sure if the problem has been fixed as of yet. No matter- see this for the great musical performances- a once-in-your-lifetime event!...

We wanted it to be a celebration.-Robbie RobertsonIn the fall of 1976, the band known simply as The Band (Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Rick Danko and Richard Manuel) had been touring for almost 16 years. They had started out backing Ronnie Hawkins, ended up backing Bob Dylan, and in between had several hit records of their own. Their farewell performance at the Winterland Theatre in San Francisco included a star-studded line up of guest performers, and is filmed in accordance with a 300-page shooting script compiled by director Martin Scorsese, which includes revealing interviews with the members as well. The film is a technical breakthrough; it went far beyond the boundaries Woodstock had set for live-action footage. The film is a legendary benchmark for rock documentaries. Scorsese ensures that the music speaks for itself.The Last Waltz is a passionate, symbolic toast to the glories of American rock & roll. Especially for those artists in the 1960s who took rock from its primitive foundations to a sturdier, more flexible form of music and expression. Although the quintet wrote many songs that helped define the era (e.g., The Weight, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down), several of the most inspirational songs in The Last Waltz are by other artists. The Band wraps itself around the style and talents of each guest artist, but never strays too far from its folk and blues roots. A wide range of musical guests Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Dr. John, Emmylou Harris among many others. Martin Scorsese masterfully captures their interactions on stage, while off stage he interviews each member sharing their experiences from sixteen years on the road. While it certainly helps to be a fan of The Band, it's not essential in order to appreciate the film's eloquent accomplishments. From a technical perspective, it's undoubtedly one of the most impressive and authentic concert films ever made.

First, I found I enjoyed most of the music throughout the film--especially since I like rock 'n blues (and there is a strong blues/rock as well as country rhythm to the songs). How can you complain when you get to hear the likes of Muddy Waters, Dr. John, Eric Clapton and many, many others performing with The Band. Second, and much more importantly, I was very, very impressed with the quality of the film work. This was NOT a typical concert film where they simply stick up a camera and record the performances. To know more about this, watch the DVD extra for The Last Waltz--Revisiting The Last Waltz. In this documentary, Robbie Robertson (from The Band) and Martin Scorsese talk about how they made the film--and it was really impressive. Instead of just stationing guys with cameras, EVERYTHING was meticulously planned and the camera angles and techniques show it. In addition to the live concert footage (which is the best I've seen), you have a few numbers that were done very well in the studio as well as interesting interviews. All in all, it's the total package--a very impressive and exceptionally well made film. While the music might not be to your liking, you can't help but admire excellent film making.

What I will say is that it's the little moments Scorcese captures that make this film for me; Robertson and Danko coming in too early on 'Helpless' much to the amusement of a coked-out-his-mind Neil Young; the little kiss Robbie gets from Joni as she comes onstage; the wide smile of Danko, watching from his drums as Hawkins does a masterful vocal turn on 'Who Do You Love'; the pathos of the second to last scene, talking about those those who the road has taken.Another stand out feature of this film is how great everyone looks. The drugs slim the band down, Robertson especially, and that emphasizes their features, magnifies emotion. The clothes are simple but fantastic; Dylan looks like the coolest man alive, Ronnie Wood's flamboyant jacket fits like a glove etc, the 70s were great for a lot of fashion and it shows here. Only Van Morrison, fat, drunk and balding in a tatty outfit is immune to the forgiving and flattering camera-work.Other than that everything people says about this is true; the music is amazing, its beautifully shot, the interludes are cool, it evokes the period, it has sadness and euphoria, its paced perfectly.

Stuff like Ten Years After, Canned Heat, King Crimson, Muddy Waters and the list goes on. One of them was The Band, a group I immediately took a liking to with their albums Music From Big Pink, The Band and Stage Fright.The Last Waltz chronicles The Band's final concert appearance at San Francisco's Winterland Theater on Thanksgiving Day, 1976. There's probably no better venue for assembling some of the best musicians in the world in one place at one time, and music fans who weren't even born yet will appreciate the performances here from the likes of Ronnie Hawkins, Joni Mitchell, Paul Butterfield, and Bob Dylan. My favorite number was probably Neil Young joining The Band with a soulful rendition of 'Helpless', while Muddy Waters kicks out those blues jams with 'Ain't That a Man'. One of the surprising numbers comes from someone you wouldn't expect to see here, with Neil Diamond offering up a passionate version of 'Dry Your Eyes'.Intersperesed with quickie interview segments, the film captures the emotional exhaustion of The Band's members as they come up on sixteen years of musical touring. I guess for them it was time to move on, even though a group like the Stones has more than doubled that tenure since this film came out. 1976, it seems so long ago.As I write this, Levon Helm passed on a couple of months ago. Watching him as a vibrant and energized performer in this documentary was in sharp contrast to a concert appearance I saw him in just last year performing with his own band. On that night he didn't even sing because he was recuperating from an illness. It's sad to see these legends pass on, but having these moments captured on film and recordings allow us to relive their glory days any time we like. If you haven't seen The Last Waltz yet, it's time that you do. If you have, watch it again.

There is no way it could have been anything other than brilliant. It is directed by one of the all time great cinema directors (Martin Scorsese). It features the farewell concert of one of the top rock and roll bands of the 60's and 70's (The Band). It shows them playing with some of the top performers of that era (Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Muddy Waters). It also has revealing interviews with Band members about their careers and life on the road.The Band are possibly overlooked in rock history because they broke up in the late 70's but this movie certainly shows their talent in all its glory. The musical versatility of Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel is a joy to see, both when performing as a group and with guest stars.As well as concert footage from the farewell gig at San Francisco's Winterland theatre there are two music numbers recorded in a studio setting. One of these is a brilliant version of Evangaline with Emmylou Harris.The interviews by Scorcese with group members are also a treat. At times, they appear to under the influence of unknown substances (especially Danko and Manuel, both no longer with us) but this only adds to the feeling that we are getting a glimpse into life on the road back in the wild days of 70's rock & roll. Robertson seems to be the leader of the group and interviews with him are interesting as they reveal his reasoning behind the split. It seems he couldn't take much more of life on the road.Definitely a must see for any fan of this era rock and roll.

Director Martin Scorsese's preparation for this one take only scene opportunity of the concert portion has cameras in the right place as well as a crystal clear audio track to capture many performers at the top of their game on a chandelier draped stage bathed in the same lush colorful light found on the damp New York streets of Taxi Driver.One by one rock stars from the previous decade and beyond take the stage and belt out a tune. Bob Dylan, Neal Young, Van Morrison, Eric Clapton even Neil Diamond and especially Dr. John doing Such a Night have bring down the house numbers. The night's outstanding performers are The Band itself. A group of five multi talented musicians whose passion for the art form put commercial success on the back burner in favor of just making music they electrify the stage with driving renditions of Cripple Creek Mystery Train and others. Drummer Levon Helm's powerful vocals are the group's high point despite attempts by lead guitarist Robbie Robertson to upstage. Robertson foolishly attempts to take on Eric Clapton in a battle of axes who in a calm, cool respectful manner vanquishes Robbie's swaggering.Offstage the members fail to ignite with Scorsese's interviewing skills scattered and reverential. The boys are mostly shy (in the case of Rick Danko, high) and modest about their accomplishments with the exception of poser Robertson who has plenty of nothing to say to fan Scorsese.There are two beautifully performed non-concert pieces featuring The Staples and Emmy Lou Harris adding to the musical feast that not only provides superior musical entertainment but also serves as a valuable timepiece to the end of an era. The dark age of Disco was about to begin.

The results are at times brilliant and at times tiresome.Considering that Scorcese was in the director's chair it's no surprise that the direction is better than you would normally expect for a concert film. The only exception is the Muddy Waters performance which, due to a miscommunication, was lucky to have been caught on film at all.The music of The Band (and their guests) may not be to everyone's taste but if you're a fan then you won't be disappointed, at least by The Band's performances. On the other hand, Neil Diamond is out of place, Van Morrison over-sings terribly on his own Caravan and some of the other performances are comparatively lackluster. The most interesting thing, for me, was discovering that Robbie Robertson is underrated as a guitarist.The documentary segments are interesting but the studio performances don't come close to matching the fervor of the live performances. The two-hour running time is a little disconcerting as well, considering that there are bound to be at least a handful of performances that you won't enjoy as much as the others.

Among such other concert films as CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH and STOP MAKING SENSE, it is a wonderful period piece, capturing its era. The musical performances in this film are very solid. The Staple Singers join in for part of THE WEIGHT, Van Morrison makes a curious stage exit before his song is even done, and Neil Diamond reminds us of the gifted songwriter he could be.BUT....I really wish the film had just stayed with the musical performances. Unfortunately, we also get numerous backstage interviews. These mar and slow down the pacing of the film and as such, these segments have not aged well. Most of The Band, speak in monotones and (no disrespect intended) but Rick Danko and Richard Manuel seem so drugged-out in these segments, it's no wonder they have since died.I could give this movie a 10 were it not for the interview segments. Still, don't let that detract you. Hit the fast-forward button and enjoy some wonderful music performances.As for what happened to the performers since then Levon Helm did get into some acting, most notably in COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER.

The pure size of this concert is something rather amazing. Not only do you get The Band doing their classics but they're joined on stage by the likes of Ronnie Hawkins (Who Do You Love), Neil Young (Helpless), Dr. John (Such a Night), Neil Diamond (Dry Your Eyes), Joni Mitchell (Coyote), Muddy Waters (Mannish Boy), Eric Clapton (Further On Up the Road), Van Morrison (Caravan) and a large finale with Bob Dylan (Forever Young, Baby Let Me Follow You Down, I Shall Be Released). Among The Band's classics are Up on Cripple Creek, Stagefright, The Shape I'm In, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down and a studio version of The Weight. Strictly speaking of the music, it's clearly wonderful with everyone giving it their all and clearly they all know that they're involved in something extremely special. Some of the highlights include Young's Helpless, Muddy Water's Mannish Boy and of course the finale with Bob Dylan who had used The Band (known as The Hawks) as his backup band and also used them for the album Planet Waves. The second aspect of the film are the interviews that Scorsese does with the group, which covers the start of their career, the girls on the road, their influences and even some moments which are clearly dark times for the group including why this was going to be the final show. I've heard many people talk about how depressing the film is because you are actually seeing their last show but while it's true it sucks the group never got back together, I think it's a little unfair to blame the movie. The movie is technically brilliant on all levels and you really have to give Scorsese and company credit for being able to pull it off. Of course, your appreciation of The Band's music is probably going to determine how much of this you actually enjoy. If you're a fan then this film is almost like a dream and especially with all of the talent involved.

Then you have the elegant Joni Mitchell fusing some otherworldly type jazz with rock and folk, the indefatigable Neil Young, the unpredictable Bob Dylan, and don't forget the Band's magnificent drummer-singer Levon Helm, who pours his entire life and soul into his music.

It's among the finest music films out there. Rather than just showing five guys on a stage just playing their hits, the film goes deeper and allows for members of the Band to tell their stories as well as play some truly amazing tunes. The overall effect is to build a connection between the musicians and the audience, and that connection is certainly there.The music itself cannot be ignored. The Band employs around a dozen guests to help them celebrate their final concert (of their original line-up). All the guests are in fine form. Dr. John does an excellent performance of Such a Night as well as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell doing Helpless. The film is packed with great performances from both the guests and the Band, with the members of the latter burning through such favourites as Up on Cripple Creek, It Makes No Difference, and Stage Fright. If there is one bad thing about this film it is that it is too short. Also, most of the spotlight is on Robbie Robertson. Very little camera time is put to Garth Hudson or Richard Manuel. But these can all be ignored because the film is still amazing anyway.

After seeing the restored re-release of the movie on a very big screen I feel like I've been missing out on the best music ever produced on the North American continent.  The Last Waltz is really a moving, singing history of rock, soul, blues and country music, performed live on stage in front of a very, very lucky audience.  You get everything from Emmylou Harris to Muddy Waters to Eric Clapton, and with The Band backing them up, all these important artists sound better than anywhere else you've ever heard them.  There's a crazy, passionate energy to almost every performance that sends chills up and down your spine.  You could literally write a book about this movie, because every 5 minutes of it evokes entire histories of popular, rootsy American music.The key, I think, to the night's performances is that The Band is ultimately humble.  When they are playing behind Dylan, or Joni Mitchell, or even Neil Diamond, they are content to support the guest artist and play the role of, well, the band.  It's like letting the guests take over the wedding, in a sense, and it works.  Dylan sounds and looks better than I've ever seen him; Van Morrison practically spontaneously combusts with soulful energy; Muddy Waters brings the house down with his low-down blues.  And still you get Levon Helm's aching performance of The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, a definitive performance of The Weight aided by The Staples Singers, and...oh yes, I forgot to mention...it's all filmed by a young Martin Scorcese, who shows he knows a thing or two about making movies. Unforgettable.

You realise that Robbie Robertson was born for the camera when you watch this... the way he moves, the way he plays his guitar and the way he talks - you just know, and you sit there in a wonderous state. Obviously, Scorsese had much to do with the technical beauty ironic - but that's what it is of the film, but it is the tightness of The Band that ensures the live spirit remains intact when transfered to a small glass screen. Finally, I have to point out that, though the whole film absolutely rocks, the set-recorded version of The Weight with The Staples as back-up is one of the most moving things you're ever likely to see or hear... only one other song has had the immediate effect of making me weep - that was Pale Blue Eyes by the Velvet Underground.

I think this is a great movie by one of the truly great directors. Of course I am not saying anything new, but I do agree with this statement.This is the 2nd best rock document behind Woodstock, but not too far behind. Some people give the interview segments a hard time, but I like them. I like the fact that except for one case (Chest Fever) the interviews don't interrupt the songs. I had listened to The Band for years and really didn't really know anything about them personally until this movie. Some people are critical of the non live performances, but the segment with the Staple Singers is my favorite part. I love that version of The Weight. I do think this would have been slightly better had fewer people working in it and on it not been stoned most of the time (and it is obvious.) The Band seems a bit too goofy and aloof in the interviews, but it is a testament of the times, and of rock excesses. This has been well documented that Scorsese was really into coke during this time, it would be interesting to see what different choices for the film he would have made without use of chemicals.I recommend this for anyone that loves great music by the great artists in the history of rock.

It completely passed me by. I was turned on to it by my neighbor, who shouted to me one day not long ago as I was mowing the lawn, I bought the 25-year anniversary edition DVD of The Last Waltz and I'll bring it over for us to watch. Having no clue what he was talking about, I checked out good-ol' IMDB and discovered that this was one critically acclaimed film.And the critics had it right. This is a great story with FANTASTIC music. Not canned, techno-pop garbage, but real rock and roll - rock and roll with soul! I never dreamed The Band was such an accomplished group - just knew them for The Weight from Easy Rider. In today's dearth of quality music, this was a refreshing find - food for a starving man. I can listen to new music for me that for everyone else is 25-30 years old.Discovering The Last Waltz was a bittersweet experience for me though. No sooner do I fall in love with Rick Danko's performance and songs in The Last Waltz that I learn he died in 1999 - and that Richard Manuel committed suicide in 1986. Watching Danko perform Stage Fright from so long ago, and knowing I could never see him do it live, gave me that same empty feeling I got when John Lennon was killed. I saw the Beatles in '64 and '65 and though it was always a distant, remote possibility that they would ever get together again, December 1980 stole away all hope.Anyway, if you're a baby boomer like me looking for new music and missed this like I did, you might check it out. It's a great find!

It's an incredible tribute to these five musicians and their ability to not only play by themselves but also back up some of the biggest names in popular music, including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. If it was merely a video about the concert, the movie would have good enough but the interviews taken a few days afterwards tell a story of their own which show the interesting story behind the Band. It is a shame though that the movie seems to focus so much on Levon Helm and Robbie Robertson in particular, as the shots with Rick Danko, Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel seemed to tell a story that could only be half told as a result. One of the most touching moments in the interviews is when Danko is showing Scorsese around the studio and telling him how he's trying to keep busy. It is easy to see from these sort of moments why Robertson says at the end of the film why the road is a goddamn impossible way of life. This is a movie for any lover of good music as it shows the story behind one of the most influential groups of the time and the respect they had from their peers.

There's so much love from all involved of the sounds people create when getting together and making harmony happen with voices and/or instruments. The director Martin Scorsese, The Band themselves, their special guests and the crowd, apparently not one of whom left the venue before the final encore (ironically, the first song in the film).So many great talents are on display here, this movie could have been nine hours and I wouldn't have left the theatre at all (except for a quick bathroom break). The commentaries, both of them, are worth hearing, especially as you watch the movie. The years since this concert just add to the overall appreciation one should have for everybody that took part in this amazing event.The Last Waltz is kind of like the Raging Bull of concert films. The only thing that could really stop The Band were themselves. Playing for so many years without a break must take a toll on anyone. But the state of mind they were in by 1976 makes me wonder if Jake La Motta felt the same way about boxing at the end of his run as the only fighter who couldn't be knocked down.

At least not like it does today. Youngsters who cut their teeth on Britney Spears wouldn't know a good tune if it jumped out and clubbed them on their heads. I know I sound like an old geezer, but bear with me. The Band was one of my two favorite rock 'n' roll groups of all time (the other is the Doors) and their farewell concert, staged at San Francisco's Winterland on Thanksgiving, 1976, may well have been the definitive moment of rock 'n' roll history, much more than Woodstock, Altamount, or even Elvis's first appearance on Ed Sullivan. Probably no musicians in history received as much hatred as The Band, who became a lightning rod for folk music purists who blamed them for Bob Dylan's defection. By 1976, however, the early 60s folk revival was little more than a footnote in music history. Although Dylan's set closed the show, he and The Band shared the spotlight with a veritable Who's Who of music greats Neil Young, Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, Doctor John, Neil Diamond (I normally cannot stand him--I loved his set here!), Muddy Waters, and the man who gave The Band their start, rockabilly great Ronnie Hawkins (The Band started out as the Hawks). The film contains several musical highlights not part of the actual concert, which were filmed on a soundstage later (Emmylou Harris, the Staple Family). Director Martin Scorcese's backstage interviews are humorous and nostalgic but leave unsaid the friction and inner turmoil that led to The Band's break-up. This is a great film with great music.

It is hard to believe that 30 years have past since this film was made and I have to say I get a very melancholy feeling watching these guys perform in this time-locked film.

Please do not misunderstand me, I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, etc., but, I think that Clapton, The Band, Dylan, EmmyLou Harris, Joni Mitchell, et al, are the essence of music. Perhaps because I grew up with them, As I sit here on my sofa listening to Dylan, it brings back memories of numerous concerts, etc, that just cn't be relived nowadays.

The film is truly a magnum opus for these performers as it celebrates the end for the Band, a band who legendarily made music with greats such as Bob Dylan, Muddy Waters, George Harrison, Eric Clapton and more. The majority of these performers, and more, came out to pay their respect to the Band and celebrate the music.Whilst backstage it was reportedly a cocaine frenzy, on stage some beautiful music was being made at the concert. Performers diverse as Neil Young, Neil Diamond, Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Paul Butterfield, Van Morrison, etc. played with the Band and poets such as Michael McClure came on stage and gave readings.Another gem of this film is the interviews that Scorsese conducted with different members of the Band and them as a whole as well as the music that was made off the stage (they said that the concert was too long as it was and that they would perform with other artists for the film)with such legends as the Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris. And also the actual waltz that Robbie Robertson composed is brilliant and haunting. Definitely recommended for someone looking to enjoy a great night of musical history and the thoughts and opinions of legends on music. "},{"Title":"This film should be played LOUD!","Date":"1 June 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Music","Review":" I have had the opportunity to read several reviews concerning Scorsese's documentary aptly titled The Last Waltz. There are many critics out there that denounce Scorsese for showing so much favoritism to non-leader Robbie Robertson on-screen both during the interviews as well as the concert. I have read other critics who hate the way that Scorsese edited this film, bringing a Hollywood element to something that was purely anti-The Establishment. Then there are others that see this film as a farce. The Band may well still be together if it weren't for this film and the persistence of Robbie Robertson. As I watched this film a second time, I could not imagine anything further from the truth. The Last Waltz was a near flawless documentary that did exactly what it promised &#133; it coupled amazing music (perhaps one of our last glances of a now commercialized industry) with talented performers and the giants of the scene paying respects to one of their own, The Band. Scorsese opens this film with bold wording that I believe summarizes this entire documentary as a whole. Those words are THIS FILM SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD! An accurate way to tell if a music documentary is succeeding is by turning the television off, but leaving the sound on. If you are still enjoying the music at the end, the documentary has succeeded.The music if flawless in The Last Waltz. In fact, it is due to this film that I purchased the full recording of that infamous night. I wanted to hear Van Morrison's soulful voice again, I wanted to hear the strangely added Neil Diamond song (which now seems to be relevant in my mind), and I wanted to hear The Staples putting the song The Weight into a whole new galaxy. Neil Young's performance with Joni Mitchell in the background still continues to haunt me days after I finished watching the film. The ability to see the entire range of The Band in just a short 117 minutes is an astonishing feat. Scorsese did it. What makes The Last Waltz groundbreaking is the passion of Scorsese. I was worried at first that there would be less music and more spoken word from the band (which I could handle, if it weren't so much of Robbie Robertson), but Scorsese kept true to The Band, giving us more moments of song than dance. For those technical junkies out there, sure, Scorsese blatantly favored Robertson more than the rest of the band, but this newbie didn't care. I was there for the music. For half of this film I closed my eyes and allowed, maybe for the first time, my ears to critic this film. What I experienced was a moment in music history that my generation will never experience, unless Coke has their corporate logo right above our artist's heads.There are two people that I would like to give a bit of recognition to as I watched The Last Waltz. The first is the cinematographer Michael Chapman for his ability to bring a crisp, smooth, young feel to this film. Other music documentaries that I have seen typically are grainy and choppy at best, feeling as if you are sitting in the classic obstructed view seating of the concert. Not with The Last Waltz. Here, we are right up next to The Band. Impressively, and what I believe brought so much emotion to the songs that they were singing, was actually seeing their expressions on their faces as they sang or played their instrument. I felt like I was right up there with Danko, Helm, Hudson, Robertson, and Manuel. I also felt extremely excited each time a new guest would appear to join The Band with one of their songs. This excitement could only have been built by good music, strong direction, and powerful, captivating cinematography. Check on all three counts. The second person that I would like to give recognition to is Levon Helm. His vocals, passion, and dedication to each song inspired me. He seemed, and felt, more like the leader of this band than the apparent Robertson was. He seemed secluded, content, and when he hit those drums my heart would beat. This man is a music God. Did anyone else witness what he did on that Mandolin? Priceless.Overall, this was a superb film that should be shown to every wanna-be musician out there in the world. I am tired of American Idol or millionaire teens telling me what I have to listen to and how I could never relate to it. Sure, maybe I am getting old, but that should not mean that the music needs to die. Scorsese preserved an infamous night in history. It is no Woodstock, but it was a photo finish. There was one moment in this film that really made me see the change of musicians in our modern society. The Band was on the road for sixteen years, and was finally calling it quits. I pose this test to you readers out there. Can you name one group within the past 10 years that has continued to tour time after time? Mr. Matthews comes to mind, but outside of that, I don't expect Jessica Simpson to keep her popularity going. If anything I would like to say Thank You to both The Band and Scorsese for making this project. If it weren't for them I would still be grumpily listening to the newest Shakira song wondering where music devolved. Now, my CD player enjoys this album. The Weight is still my favorite song on the album, but it is a near photo finish with the haunting Neil Young song. What a talented bunch of musicians that traveled, played for their fans, and sang about life. What more can you ask for?

But they were more than that.The Band drew succour/inspiration from diverse roots everything from 18th- /19th-century American folk, to contemporary music of its time which reflected the insecurity of the Vietnam War, changing social mores, and Dylan's plaint that The Times they are a-changing.Nothing makes this more plain (and more immediate) than the stellar cast assembled for the concert. There was a query as to why Neil Diamond was invited/attended. The obvious answer is/was that he represents the dying stages of a songwriting clique which will never exist again. Tin Pan Alley has gone, but its legacy is always present as are the songs...If one takes the interspersed interviews/dialogue with band members at 'face-value', then they form a picture of a struggling 'road' band which, at any time, could have ceased to exist. But they carried-on regardless and history (well... at least musical history) was made.The 'boozy'/'stoned' dialogue between Scorcese and the band is also integral to the movie (for such it is). It not only 'humanizes' the narrative but, perhaps, also indicates WHY they were self-destructing.Regardless of Levon Helm's 'hatchet-job' in his 'tell-all' interviews and autobiography, my (and, I hope, your) appreciation of The Last Waltz is that, regardless of detractors, it is quite simply one of the best concert films ever made.Forget the vituperative and venomous fall-out.

The Last Waltz is a great flick, but most of it was re-dubbed (Except for Helm's drumming and singing) way after it was in the can. Robbie Robertsons microphone was intentionally left off for this concert as Robbie wasn't the best singer and his comments during the film are pretentious at best. Enjoy the music of The Band in this film and see if you can detect the animosity between the rest of The Band members and Robertson during the interviews as Robertson was the one that wanted this flick to happen.

Their musicianship is stunningly played out as they play back up band to the finest musical artists (okay Neil Diamond isn't quite there but who cares). This is not a film to be missed.

Aside from getting to hear the Band and numerous other great performers (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Ringo Starr and Neil Young, to name a few), the documentary is also a look back at an era gone by. Among other things, the layered hairdos that they have look a lot better than the spiked hair that we see nowadays.It just goes to show that even if that specific era has passed, the music will never die. This documentary is nostalgia in its best form. May the Band's work be remembered forever! I recommend The Last Waltz to everyone.

The Band are to music what Scorsese is to cinema, original, visionary, and uncompromising. As you could imagine this team-up clearly results in one of the greatest experiences in the history of popular culture. Whether you are a fan of The Band or not doesn't matter at all. Ten minutes into this film and you will be mesmerized. Scorsese is completely respectful and admirable in his filming of The Band's final concert, and the subsequent interviews. The roster of guest's at the concert only add to the once in lifetime experience of this film. The Last Waltz is as deep and emotional as anything Scorsese has ever made in his career, and his enthusiasm for the music really comes alive in the set pieces with The Staple's, and Emmylou Harris respectfully. The bottom line is, if you even remotely care for music or film, see The Last Waltz and be hearkened back to a time and place when both music and film actually meant something. See it now, you won't regret it.

They are very talented traditional rock musicians, but unless you're a fairly big fan of their music you'll probably end up bored with this movie. Or, if it's on TV, you'll be flipping around to other channels to see if anything better is on.For exaggerated reasons that frustrate me, this film is constantly listed among the greatest rock-documentaries of all time. It's not. Perhaps it's over-rated simply because Scorcese directed it. Perhaps it's overrated because some of the camera angles are pretty cool. Perhaps it's overrated because of all the big-name musical guests who appear. But, none of the guests are in their prime, save Dr. John who never seems to age and Neil Young who never seems to change. But, still it's not their best performances. And The Band needs guests to sustain interest. Afterall, this is The Band so-named only in relation to other musicians-- their major claim to fame is that they played as Bob Dylan's backup band in the 1960s. Robbie Robertson is handsome, but a terrible singer. The guitar parts are boring (One Dylan biography even described The Band's inability to intuitively jam on stage when Dylan began noodling on his guitar), yet their playing ignores the folk and blues derived melodies, and the originals all sound alike.The film is highlighted, musically, by Dr. John smiling and playing piano, Muddy Waters standing there and singing on The Band's lackluster performance of Who Do You Love, Bob Dylan's cool hat, Emmylou Harris looking pretty during a rehearsal, The Staple Singers stealing the show on The Weight (it's hilarious when the film goes back to the band, when the bass-player sings the verse, he looks so unprofessional and goofy in comparison to the Staples' authentic soul. The Staples really helped the set!), Joni Mitchell's weird, aimless song, and that's about it. Van Morrison looks fat and miserable. Neil Diamond sings an old classic of his without verve or variation (or movement). Neil Young seems distracted during his dull performance (but Scorcese doesn't even show the cocaine on his nose). And, the best part is probably the encore-scene, just the Band playing Greensleeves on old-timey instruments while the credits role. But it's only the names that appear that are historic, none of the performances are really historic. I guarantee this film won't last. It's all hype. It's not interesting enough (and The Band is not charismatic enough) to sustain itself through generations.There are some kinda-amusing, but overall meaningless anecdotes told by The Band during interviews, placed in between songs... but mostly it's just them jabbering about their embarrassingly half-thought ideas about the world (While not quite as stupid-sounding as the parody-interviews in This Is Spinal Tap, Robbie Robertson still does come off as a high-blown dumbass) and why the music they like is the best music in the world, which is supposed to give credence to their overall-mediocre originals.Also, what's with the confederate flag hanging behind them in their kitchen, or trailer, or wherever it is they're being interviewed. They're from Canada! (Except for Levon Helms, who plays his drums hunched over like a praying mantis-- cute.) Are we supposed to like these guys? The Last Waltz truly exposes them as a bunch of derivative, blown-up musical hacks who possess both fake accents and a freakish obsession with the American south.There is talent on display in The Last Waltz, and often, but unfortunately it's usually it's aimless and floundering. The overall affect can be boredom if you're not already a hardcore fan. However, the documentary is a worthwhile watch if you're bored or interested in learning the stories behind rock bands.Dylan never even considered these guys his best backup band. He knew.

Man, these guys look TIRED. Not one is even 40 yet, but they all sound like they are speaking from beyond the grave. It's hard to imagine that this movie has inspired anyone to pick up a guitar and go on the road. It almost comes off as a cautionary tale, a VH1 Behind the Music without the second-act redemption. The stench of drugs, desperation and defeat are truly palpable.I think the musical performance here is somewhat overrated (most of the many great moments are provided by the guest artists, not by The Band), but as a document of a certain moment in time, this film has no peers.

Marty Debergy (whoops, I'm getting ahead of myself) decided to film it in an apparent attempt to be more 'personal' than that of Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, and failed utterly. Intercutting (including with hard audio cuts - I guess music is a visual medium to Scorsese) lame attempts at interviews (attempting, occasionally, to star himself), Scorsese manages to make a group of wonderful songs (and singers) into a fairly tedious exercise. Spinal Tap (by Rob Riener) skewered this movie and its flaws so completely that I cannot even look at the title without thinking of 'Tap'. I bought the (triple - vinyl) soundtrack, and it is a much more enjoyable without any of the drek of the movie. Check that out instead.For those who annouce this as the 'perfect' concert movie, I point them at Rust Never Sleeps, made only a year later but a far better 'concert experience' movie.

Shot with 35mm and adorned with a magnificent stage design, the images are stunning.  On the other hand, Scorsese's interviews are weak, his staged sequence of The Weight forgettable, and final montage a complete bore.  Than again, not liking THE BAND makes me biased so I don't want to go on some ignorant rant. I mean, I discovered Robbie Robertson is a cool dude, two members of the group have since killed themselves, and that Scorsese is a madman.  Still, if you want a picture that truly captures the spirit of rock, let me suggest GIMME SHELTER.  Although not as stylistically elaborate or well conceived, GIMME SHELTER is ten times more entertaining.

Supported by a range of friends who may be recognisable to some sharp-eyed rock and roll fans, the gig was captured by Martin Scorsese as part of a documentary looking at the band and their final show called The Last Waltz.Although I know some of their music I was not familiar with The Band, so I came to this film on the strength of recommendations of other viewers who know what sort of music I like as well as the fact that this was a Martin Scorsese film. Despite that I immediately got into the film although I do recognise that those looking to this to fulfil the documentary side of things will probably be disappointed. In this area we are left with very little talking and, although it is relaxed and engaging, it is hardly that informative beyond providing basic information and the odd nugget here and there. No, this is not a documentary in the way that the term would suggest, instead this is a concert film and a very, very good one at that.With a vast array of guests joining The Band on stage, this is an impressive gig. The songs are mostly memorable and there are very few performances that could not be described as at least good. The list of names should be enough to interest you (unless you honestly have zero interest in the period or the type of music) as those popping up in support include Bo Dylan, Neil Diamond, Dr John, Emmylou Harris, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, Neil Young and Van Morrison to name a few. I cannot imagine many people struggling to enjoy the music and, if you enjoy some of it then you will more than likely just about all of it. The Band members are all impressive on stage and they also come over as very natural, chilled and funny in the interview sections.Overall this is an impressive and enjoyable concert film. As an informative documentary it falls down by not having a lot to teach the audience, however this is a minor complaint because the interviews are still fun and the main focus of the film is the music. This aspect is great and I enjoyed almost all the artists and songs. Well worth seeing if you like great music performed by some great artists.

I could not remember any of it. I didn't try to. Now, about 28 years later, I buy the powered-up DVD version for half nothing and settle down to watch.OK, get this out of the way first. One point for Neil Young sings from the heart. One point for Van Morrison sings from the soul. One point (should be several, but then you might get the wrong impression at first glance) for Muddy Waters showing everyone how it should be done.Who messed up whom? Did The Bland make a fool of Bob Dylan and turn that fine word-smith into another mediocrity straining after effect? Or did Bylan turn The Bland into this cod folk-rock band with a taste for everything and nothing?Think about the campy stage set. Hey, what a send up! Someone knew what this junk was all about. Maybe a point for him too, yes?The DVD goes to a charity shop tomorrow.

By 1976 The Band were at least 4 years past there peak and at times they give the impression here of a group that had played together just a few too many times. The interviews are shallow but Robbie Robertson still manages to come across as one of the smuggest people ever. It's worth catching for some of the guest performances - The Band manage to temporarily wake up when Ronnie Hawkins is on, Joni Mitchell is brave enough not to trot out a greatest hit. The highlight though is watching Van Morrison 'dance' during Caravan - a unique performance never imitated. The lowlight is some chap called Robert Zimmerman performing a bad Bob Dylan impersonation doing one of the master's greatest songs Forever Young. To some up an interesting look at mid-seventies rock aristocracy. Younger viewers might just feel that punk arrived just when it was needed most.

It was Leroy Helm, who played Loretta Lynn's Daddy in Coal Miner's Daughter.  Then I heard the interviewer, and I recognized that voice.  Damn, that's Martin Scorsese! I said out loud.  I was sorry I came in late on this, because the music was fantastic, and it was a thoroughly fascinating documentary about rock music.  There were so many late 70's rock stars singing, and I was just sorry that Linda Ronstadt and Kris Kristofferson weren't part of it.

Bob Dylan and the Band were personal heroes, as were Joni Mitchell and Neil Young.Overall, I left the cinema in a somewhat deflated state.  There was no doubting the charisma of Robertson, but he was not, for me, the heart of the Band and too much attention was given to him.  The interviews were interesting but too truncated.I was less than impressed by the concert footage.  Whoever let Neil Young on stage in that state has a lot to answer for.  Muddy Waters was outstanding as was Joni.I have always thought Van Morrison a pain in the posterior and my views were confirmed here.The Band itself was excellent and Dylan was awesome.The surprise package of the night was Neil Diamond, a singer and songwriter whom I have often dismissed completely.  His presence at the farewell concert was a major surprise (although I heard somewhere that Robertson had produced a couple of his albums).  I was knocked out by his powerful rendition of a song, Dry your eyes, that he co-wrote with Robertson.  It is a pity that he has never really delivered on the potential he displays here.

I may have dozed off for a bit.The opening words on the screen at least summarise what it is I don't get about this kind of rock music This film should be played loud. Why? What's the idea? If it's ALL loud (and believe me, it is), how does one appreciate the loudness of any particular bit, apart from developing a headache? Music that asks us to revel in its sheer volume has something to hide. Scorsese might more aptly have said This film must be played loud in order to register at all.The strange thing is that most of the songs (there's enough musical variety for there to be exceptions) fall flat; their musical content falls just short of enough and they need ENERGY, not mere loudness, to come off. Most of the musicians seemed skilled but exhausted.The concert footage is at least filmed properly. Scorsese does nothing but train cameras on the performers so as to enable us to see what they're doing; he doesn't try to mold the concert, which is its own work of art, into HIS work of art. But the behind-the-scenes interviews are a boring waste of time. No doubt they satisfy the wish I expressed earlier, and diminish the loudness while they last, but any other footage that served the same purpose would have worked just as well.
