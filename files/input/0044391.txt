This incisive take about how movies are made, directed by Vincente Minnelli, dares to go behind the scenes to show what goes on in the way the film industry operates. The film adaptation by Charles Schnee gives us a good idea of that unreal world of fantasy and hype.At the center of the story is Jonathan Shields, a young man with connections to the industry. He wants to follow his father's footsteps and goes at it vigorously, making friends and enemies along the way. Jonathan discovers he can be ruthless whenever he wants. His first victim is Fred Amiel, the talented director who Jonathan bypasses in favor of a more established one. Jonathan quickly forgets the friendship Fred and his wife showed him before becoming a big producer.Then there is there is Georgia Larrion, the boozy daughter of a famous actor. Jonathan shows how he wants Georgia to succeed in the business, personally taking care of selling her to star in his big project, only to betray her with another woman, a glamorous bit player. When Georgia discovers the truth, she flees Jonathan's mansion in a clear night that suddenly turns into a torrential downpour and loses control of the car, but she doesn't suffer a scratch!The last victim of Mr. Shields is the Pulitzer prize winner, James Lee Bartlow, who Jonathan coaxes into leaving his academic life to adapt his own novel for the movies. James is married to the flighty Rosemary, in whom Jonathan discovers a weak link that will do anything to hobnob with the celebrities. Jonathan makes it easy for Rosemary to fall into an affair with the star of Shields' film.When we first watched this film, it seemed much better, than on this viewing where a lot of things surface to make some of the story much weaker than before. Some viewers have compared this film with the fate of Orson Welles in Hollywood, and there are a couple of references that could be interpreted that way. Whether it was so, or not, it's up to the viewer to guess where the truth lies.Kirk Douglas gave a strong performance as Jonathan Shields. Mr. Douglas showed he clearly understood who this man was. He runs away with the film, in our humble opinion. Lana Turner, a beautiful presence in any movie, is good, but at times she appears to be overwhelmed by the range of emotions she has to project, especially with that phony car scene.Dick Powell and Gloria Graham put in an excellent appearance as the Bartlows. Barry Sullivan disappears after Lana shows up, not to be seen until the end. Walter Pigeon is effective as the studio head. Gilbert Roland is perfect as Gaucho, the Latin actor with a lot of charisma.Mr. Minnelli shows he wasn't afraid to portray the industry the way we see it in the film, not a small accomplishment, knowing well how it could have backfired on him. Hollywood is not forgiving to those who dare to show its ugly side and that's when the parallel with Orson Welles problems with the system and eventual exile can be drawn.

All three are brought to Harry Pebbel's office where he makes a pitch for the help of each one. And we're told in flashback the dynamics of the relationships between Shields and each one.One thing about Tinseltown, they've never been afraid to show the seamier side of movie-making. Kirk Douglas's Jonathan Shields is a not too thinly disguised version of David O. Selznick. The same drive, the same ambition, the same overwhelming ego that Selznick was legendary for is a part that was tailor made for Kirk Douglas.The three betrayed people, director Fred Amiel(Barry Sullivan), star Georgia Lorrison(Lana Turner), and screenwriter James Lee Barlow(Dick Powell)all ring very true. One of the things I like about this film is that all three stories, each in itself, could be expanded into a film all it's own. Lana Turner's role as the ersatz Diana Barrymore is not to hard to spot either. It's so much better here than the film based on her own book Too Much Too Soon. If that voice of Turner's actor father on those 78 rpms she's playing sounds familiar, it's that of Louis Calhern. Turner's was a life lived out all too well in the tabloids and she brings all of it to bear in playing Gerogia Lorrison.Dick Powell, who was offered the lead as Jonathan Shields, opted to play tweedy professor turned screenwriter James Lee Barlow. This was Powell's next to last feature picture as an actor, it should have been the one he went out on. Powell was always ahead of the industry's cutting edge and he decided to concentrate more on directing and acting for the small screen.Powell's segment includes Gloria Grahame as his flirty wife. Post World War II Hollywood, whenever it had a part for a tramp, first call Gloria Grahame. Here she responds with an Academy Award winning performance. She hasn't many scenes, but as was said in another MGM picture around that time, what there is is cherce.I don't think there's ever been an actor who can go from zero to sixty on the emotional scale as quickly as Kirk Douglas. Check the scene when Lana Turner discovers how Douglas betrayed her. The intensity of his reaction alone is frightening and real. Douglas was also up for an Oscar, but it went that year to laconic Gary Cooper in High Noon.Vincente Minelli put all the pieces together just right and it comes out great entertainment.

Not especially revealing about Hollywood, which at this stage wasn't quite ready to unmask itself, but still engaging and intriguing. Douglas is well-cast (he spits out his lines with a terse jaw--nothing new--but he's right for this part and is commendable). Turner is a revelation and deserved at the very least an Oscar nomination for her work; the picture did go on to win Academy Awards in five categories, including Gloria Grahame as Best Supporting Actress; Charles Schnee, Best Screenplay; Robert Surtees, Best Cinematography, Black-and-White; Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White; and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White.

Three of these people tell of their dealings with him, and none of them have too many good things to say.I liked the first and third segments but didn't care for the middle one with Lana Turner simply because Turner became so melodramatic, too hysterical for me. Barry Sullivan was excellent in the first part and helped get me into the story. He was the director who got screwed by Douglas.Turner was the unknown actress whom Douglas turned into a star while the last part dealt with the key screenwriter for Douglas, played by Dick Powell. I thought Powell was the best of the four main characters of the film but his segment was the shortest, unfortunately. As good as he was, his wife was equally as annoying. She was played by the normally entertaining and alluring Gloria Grahame, who was anything but that in this role. She sounded ludicrous with her fake southern accent. How she won an Academy Award for this role is mind- boggling.Some classify this movie as film noir, but I dispute that. It's simply a straight drama with soapish overtones. It's well-written, however, and keeps one's interest all the way, so I am not knocking this movie. It has a good things going for it.

Selznick,   cough), while also showing too the joys of working in the business. But   it's a business at its most booming time, coming out of the 40s where   the producer was king, and the director had to vie for room at times to   really get his vision in. Here the producer Jonathan Shields is played   by Kirk Douglas as someone with big ideas at first- he even has an idea   to help make a scary movie about cats even more frightening by not   showing the cats (echoes of Val Lewton). Soon he rises the ranks and   becomes big enough to really call the shots all he wants, but it also   gets in the way of personal relationships, severs ties, and sometimes   even makes him out to be monstrous (there's one shot I remember all the   time where Douglas, in a big fit of anger against Lana Turner's   character, seems like he's a whole foot taller with the ego almost   manifested). The narrative of the film is a retelling by people who   knew him, a sexy but soon disillusioned actress, a director who once   worked with Shields but then got cut off from him, and a writer played   by Dick Powell.    Rashomon or Citizen Kane it is not in trying to reveal more grandiose   and amazing things about human nature, but rather a supreme rumination   on the good times and the bad times, possibly more of the latter.   What's great about Douglas's portrayal is that through the stories from   the three ex-friends and co-workers and lovers, he becomes a very   well-rounded character. At the core, of course, is the producer who at   the time had as more creative say than anyone else on the set. This   brings some of the great scenes ever shown about movie-making, such as   the moment when Amiel, the director, tries to put Jonathan in his   place about how a scene should be shot, in order to direct a picture   you need humility. Another comes with the moment when Jonathan and his   soon to be 'asistant to the producer' has to object out of just being   stunned. But more than Douglas, it's also tremendous, memorable screen   time for Lana Turner, perhaps in her most successful performance in   just sheer acting terms (not necessarily just in presence or style like   in other pictures), and for Dick Powell, who with this and Murder My   Sweet has two defining roles outside of his usual niche.    With many sweet camera moves, a script that crackles with the kind of   scenes and dialog that makes one wish for the glory times of   Hollywood's Golden Age, and at least four or five really excellent   performances, The Bad and the Beautiful might not be as astounding and   near-perfect as 8 1/2 or as funny as Bowfinger, but it ranks up there   with the best movies about movie-making, and can make for some fine   entertainment even for those who aren't really interested in how movies   are made.

Similar to Citizen Kane in style (though not quite at that level in quality), The Bad And The Beautiful presents us with the character of Jonathan Shields (Douglas) as seen through the eyes of four people who worked with him.I'm not sure who the Shields character was based upon. I believe his character was actually an amalgamation of several producers and directors. You certainly get to see a lot of the traits producers have become infamous for.However, these traits are all presented through the eyes of others and, as such, we are never sure what truly made Shields tick. We can only guess by putting together the different viewpoints and that is pretty much true to life.The cast did a great job with director Amiel (Sullivan) starting things off. The performances were not terribly deep or wrenching, but the story didn't really call for it. Lana Turner was very good as the starlet living in her father's shadow, but I'm not sure why she received top billing. Gloria Grahame did win an Oscar for her supporting role, which was surprising. The role was barely significant enough to be supporting. She was, as always, very charming in it though.Overall, an excellent slice-of-Hollywood-life disguised as a biopic. It will make for a fun viewing with characterizations you can think about for weeks to come. "},{"Title":"Give the Devil his Due","Date":"27 November 2010","Score":"11 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" During this time in the early 50s there were quite a number of Hollywood pictures which scrutinised and often satirised Hollywood itself. The old studio system had been seriously weakened in the war years, the young crop of independent producers and writer-directors were gaining ever more prominence, and the dream factory as a whole had become a little more introspective, not to mention cynical. But while Sunset Boulevard, All About Eve (about the theatre, but the point carries through) and Singin' in the Rain aimed their sights at the injustice and hypocrisy of the star system, The Bad and the Beautiful takes on the thorny issue of creative control.The Bad and the Beautiful is referenced extensively in auteurist Martin Scorsese's 1995 documentary on American movies, as an explanation of the antagonism between a producer's commercial drive and a director's artistic one. However it is far from a validation of auteur theory, for while it emphasises the importance of the director's role, it also points out (quite correctly) the equally crucial contributions of the writer and the producer himself. Incidentally the actual producer of The Bad and the Beautiful is John Houseman, primarily an actor who really only dabbled (albeit quite successfully) in production, and thus someone who could perhaps afford to snipe from the sidelines. Oddly enough screenwriter Charles Schnee would also turn to producing soon after this. He certainly shows extensive insider knowledge of the industry.The director of The Bad and The Beautiful is Vincente Minnelli, a man whose flowing and extravagant style was put to best use in the musical genre, and although he was certainly competent in drama he does tend to overdo things a little for the form. One typically impressive Minnelli manoeuvre is the lengthy tracking shot at the party about fifteen minutes in, in which the camera is carried from one character to the next, while the careful arrangement of extras draws our eyes from one point of focus to another, a woman singing beautifully yet unnoticed in one corner, while a gossipy starlet is surrounded by a gaggle of admirers in another. Minnelli's tendency to keep all the characters in shot together during dialogue scenes means there is no need for back-and-forth editing. When there is a cut it is a meaningful jump, such as the close-up when Sullivan is told he won't be directing Shield's first big picture. Ultimately though the elaborate nature of Minnelli's direction is disproportionate to the needs of the picture, and a more stripped-down approach could have intensified the drama.Another lesson The Bad and the Beautiful teaches us, both through its plot and its own example, is the importance of the right actors in a production. The majority of players in this large ensemble cast tend towards a uniform competence. People like Walter Pidgeon, Barry Sullivan and Vanessa Brown give steady, solid performances, not outstanding but apt to their characters. Dick Powell has a neat writer-ish cynicism to him, and it is only him and the vivacious Gloria Grahame that threaten to steal the show. A gratingly melodramatic Lana Turner is the only conspicuously bad player. However at the heart of The Bad and the Beautiful lies the powerful turn by Kirk Douglas. Douglas plays Shields with the mix of realism and exaggeration of a larger-than-life character, capturing the producer's boyish enthusiasm and exposing his inner fragility in a way that draws attention and lingers in the mind.And it is here that we can see the picture's real worth. It is all very well making an accurate and incisive behind-the-scenes study of Hollywood's methods and morals, but to have any point the picture should also be an engaging and entertaining piece of storytelling. The Bad and the Beautiful is not especially romantic or funny or suspenseful, and yet it was a big hit, being the second-highest grossing picture of 1952. It seems the best thing this picture has going for it is the very character of Shields himself, who as written by Schnee and played by Douglas is both a fascinating and, yes, sympathetic individual. And the overriding message seems to be that, while producers tend to be a rather dysfunctional lot, it is their drive and efficiency that is behind many of the best things in movies. The picture's original title Tribute to a Bad Man is eminently better than the one it got saddled with. Jonathon Shields is clearly not a nice person, but through its compelling portrayal The Bad and the Beautiful salutes him. "},{"Title":"The composer the star","Date":"18 May 2006","Score":"21 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" My tribute to the great Hollywood film composer, David Raksin, is long overdue. I only discovered the other day that he died a couple of summers ago at the considerable age of 92. I suppose I had thought that like most of those figures who reached their peak in the middle of the last century he had passed away many years ago. A re-seeing of The Bad and the Beautiful fairly recently reminded me of just how outstanding was his contribution to movies of all shades of quality. I first became aware of the uniqueness of the Raksin 'sound' on my original viewing of Wyler's Carrie in 1952. It is impossible to define, other than to say that it owes nothing to central European romanticism, the sound of almost all the in-house studio composers such as Newman, Stothart and Steiner, or to the tradition of 20th century symphonists such as Copland and Diamond which fed the imagination of film composers as diverse as Elmer Bernstein and David Amram. Raksin had a sound all his own as did Bernard Herrmann and Miklos Rozsa, as instantly recognisable as theirs but I feel his range is wider. He seldom repeated himself as did Rozsa who composed in the same style regardless of genre. (Double Idemnity, Ben-Hur and Madame Bovary have nothing common apart from their same sort of watered down Kodaly-like music.) His style is intensely lyrical, conceived with a verve and passion that always transcended the most trivial movies and made them, if not worth watching, always worth listening to. Unlike many of his colleagues he seldom hit the jackpot by working on films of great quality. I think it only happened twice, with Abraham Polonsky's B movie Force of Evil which has become recognised as a marvellous example of film noir and of course William Wyler's Carrie where he was just one of many outstanding contributors to what I have long argued is possibly the greatest work of art to have ever emerged from the Hollywood studio system. Although it has its passionate advocates, I cannot share their enthusiasm for Vincente Minnelli's The Bad and the Beautiful. It is certainly very professional in the way it slickly dissects an unsympathetic character through the flashback reminiscences of those he mistreated, but it had all been done before and considerably better in Citizen Kane and All About Eve. However the film is worth watching if only to wallow in Raksin's gorgeous score. And there is plenty of it, particularly in accompanying all those voice-off narrations. And then just as one is beginning to wonder if the marvellous opening credit theme is about to be heard once too often, the composer introduces something entirely new for the Dick Powell narrative, a jaunty section based on a four-note motif (a falling perfect fifth, rising up a major sixth, then down a major seventh). The way this is subsequently developed is truly symphonic. Incidentally if you want to discover a film score that has the length and complexity of a symphony just close your eyes (you won't be missing much) and listen to Forever Amber. Raksin in excelsis!

But whatever the reason, The Bad and the Beautiful pulls no punches in looking at its topic. The movie portrays some people explaining how they used to be friends of producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) but have since turned against him. There's the director whom Shields promised a directing job but betrayed him, the writer who lost his wife to Shields's actions, and the actress whom Shields drove to madness.I thought that one of the most effective scenes in the movie was Kirk Douglas holding Lana Turner in his arms. Here he is, this overbearing, hostile character forced to almost coddle his gorgeous female star; it might be showing how he may seemingly have exalted her, but he remains in a higher position and is merely using her and sending her into insanity. And the scene of her driving the car while completely upset elaborates on this idea.And then, there's the writer. He and his wife move from Virginia hoping to get really big in Hollywood...until tragedy strikes. It all goes to show the disaster inherent in any industry (of course, Douglas's character exacerbates any problem). But anyway, this is a formidable part of cinema history; a precursor to movies like The Player. Also starring Dick Powell, Walter Pidgeon and Gloria Grahame (who won Best Supporting Actress).

This is what Hollywood liked to think would pass for gritty expose' but was little more than a glossy, retelling of hoary industry myth. (For an update on the story see Altman's The Player) Kirk Douglas (at the absolute top of his game here) plays the S.O.B. producer, Lana Turner (in that brief moment between the baby fat and middle age that seemed to overtake her so swiftly) as the cynical, hard-drinking, vulnerable, showbiz outcast, near ex-actress, Barry Sullivan as the neophyte director looking for a break, Walter Pidgeon as the bottomline fixated studio head, and Dick Powell as the Pulitzer prize winning author and font of high quality original material. The supporting cast is chock full of quality types, Gloria Grahame has some nice moments as Powell's wife, Gilbert Roland as a Latin Horndog and the magnificent Elaine Stewart as the current object of his rutting interest. Douglas' Jonathan Shields is brilliant and ruthless, in fact, so brilliant that it's difficult to see how he came to be in such poor circumstances at the opening of the film. But he quickly surrounds himself with the components necessary to move smartly up the ladder and therein, of course, lies the rub. He sees those around him as little more than 'components' and they recognise the opportunity for great wealth and fame he offers them while they luxuriate in the comfortable fiction that their relationships to him are more than 'just business'. Hurt feelings and gnashing of teeth to follow but not before the Turner character has a career again, the Sullivan character has a resume, the Pidgeon character is awash in black ink and the Powell character has banked thousands of relative easy dollars and accumulated enough first-hand material for a blockbuster on Hollywood Babylon. Director Vincente Minnelli delivered a solid entertainment and it should be measured as just that. It is a well-made melodrama that exposes little about the 'real' Hollywood. It does not match the sophistication of All About Eve nor the mesmerising drama of Sunset Boulevard but it will hold your attention for the full running time and amuse you in the bargain.

The Hollywood community was aware that the public knew their patented make-believe was just that, and so they were willing to share the truth about Hollywood with the public fairly often.But these films got darker in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1950 Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD showed how the world had forgotten it's celebrities and stars of the late silent period a generation earlier. In 1951, although ostensibly a comedy, SINGING IN THE RAIN did show the disaster to so many silent careers (even the detestable Lila Lamont's) that sound brought in it's wake. Yet with all the viewing of the effect of the film industry's changes on the lives of actors, few tackled that of production people.Vincent Minelli's 1952 THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL did just that, studying the career of a super film producer. It's use of organized series of flashbacks reminds of that this film's producer was John Houseman, once the partner of Orson Welles in his Mercury Theater. The constant comment that the anti-hero of the film, Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) is dismissed as a genius is like the disparagement shown to boy-genius Welles when he showed up in Hollywood. But the basic model for the producer seems to be David O. Selznick, whose father was prominent in the 1920s, until forced out by rivals in the industry. Jonathan's father was also a big shot until he too was thrown out by his rivals.Briefly the plot of the story is how Shields made a career out of the work of other people, several of whom he hurt by discarding as soon as he could. First is his co-producer/director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), whose treatment plan for a major film is taken from him by Shields to sell the studio on backing it. Amiel hoped to direct it, but it is directed instead by Von Ellstein (Ivan Triesaut - a kind of clone of Josef Von Sternberg). Amiel breaks with Shields as a result, and never will work for him again. However, Amiel is able within a few years to be one of the most successful Hollywood directors anyway.That incident was in 1936 (a film preview is shown at a theater showing ANNA KARENINA with Garbo and Fredric March - an MGM film, just like this one). In 1941 Shields is casting the leading role for a film to be shot by Harry Whitfield (Leo G. Carroll - possibly a clone of Alfred Hitchcock). He decides to hire Georgia Lorison (Lana Turner) for the female lead opposite Gaucho (Gilbert Roland). Lorison is the daughter of a classic leading actor of the past (his voice is heard - it is Louis Calhern's), who died impoverished and an alcoholic wreck (the father and daughter are supposed to be John and Diane Barrymore). Georgia is trying to keep off the sauce herself, and falls on the day shooting is to begin. Since Jonathan learns that Georgia loves him, he romances her. It is only when the film is in the can that he breaks it off, rather roughly. Georgia's performance makes her a success in Hollywood, but she never will work for Jonathan again.Finally we have the story of novelist James Lee Barlow (Dick Powell) and his wife Rosemary (Gloria Grahame). Barlow is in Hollywood to write the screenplay version of his best selling novel of the deep south (he's a clone for William Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe, with some F.Scott Fitzgerald in). As Rosemary keeps James Lee from working, Jonathan tries to get the author into isolation to work, and preoccupies Rosemary with Gaucho (who had come onto her at a party). But Gaucho and Rosemary are killed in a plane crash. James Lee finishes the script, but an argument between Jonathan and Von Ellstein causes the latter to quit the film. Jonathan ruins the film because he has no talent as a director. Still he and James Lee might work on a new project together, but a stupid remark by Jonathan causes James Lee to realize that Gaucho and Rosemary were together on that ill-fated trip due to Jonathan. So he too leaves the producer. But subsequently he writes a novel about his wife, and wins a Pulitzer Prize.Called together by Jonathan's financial head, Harry Pebble (Walter Pidgeon), the three victims of Shields refuse a new offer for just one final picture with him. But at the conclusion they all show curiosity on just what the new idea of his is.THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL had a wonderful script - it has many intricate bits in it that one has to catch on repeated viewings. Pebble (originally Shields' boss) dismisses him until he sees the treatment of the novel that Amiel wrote - he thinks it is Shields' ideas). He says in front of a seething Fred Amiel he always thought Shields a genius. Later, of course, he realizes it was not Jonathan's work. Similarly Von Ellstein congratulates Jonathan on being the first producer whose treatment of a book resembles the work of a director. Later he too realizes it was Fred's work, and ironically the collapse of Jonathan's position is begun when Von Ellstein lectures Jonathan on how you can't just stuff a film with a series of climaxes but have to build to one. Also the first time Georgia and James Lee discuss a film script they accidentally (by lack of knowledge on his part, and by temporary failure of memory on hers) hurt each other without realizing it. It becomes a rich tapestry of the industry and the various lives that get involved in it. As such it is one of the best films about movie making ever made.

This moment foreshadows Shield's tough love approach toward everyone who's ever worked with him&#x97;in the case of Georgia, Shields drew the mustache on a photographic portrait of Georgia's father who she couldn't break free from despite his death ten years earlier, leading her to an ugly bout with alcohol.The first sequence (and best part of the film) focuses on Amiel's recollections who broke into the film business with Shield's help. Right away we learn that Shields is the son of a well-known Hollywood silent picture director who was broke at the time of his death. In a rather over the top scene, Ameil badmouths Shield's father at his funeral as Jonathan pays mourners to attend. Shields won't pay Amiel after hearing him disparaging his father but later Amiel shows up at the Shields mansion (about to be sold) to apologize. This marks the beginning of their friendship.The Amiel recollections grow more fascinating. Shields borrows money from his friends and loses about $6,000 in a poker game with some big-time Hollywood executives. But instead of setting him back, Shields convinces Harry Pebel to give him a job as his assistant with the proviso that he garner his pay check in order to pay back the poker debt. More 'insider' peeks at the film business Shields and Amiel work on their first big success, The Doom of the Cat Man as well as the inner mechanics of 'audience testing' (just like today, ratings cards are handed out to pre-screeners).Shields and Amiel pay a visit to the now shuttered mansion of an actor who used to work for Shield's father. Curiously, Shields never knew he had a daughter and they find her there drowning her sorrows in alcohol (we never see her face, only her legs dangling over a trapdoor in the attic). Soon, the studio honchos green light Shield's work on 'The Faraway Mountain', an A picture based on a well-known novel. Shields wines and dines the big-time Latin actor, 'Gaucho' to star in the picture but he ends up drinking too much and passing out. That's an example of one of the many different sides of Shield's character we see throughout the film. The 'Amiel' sequence concludes with him being forced out by Sheilds who is pressured by the studio executives to hire an established director, Van Ellstein (perhaps modeled on Von Stroheim or Otto Preminnger), wonderfully played by Ivan Triesault.The film begins to lose steam in the second sequence narrated by Georgia Larrison. She's the girl Shields discovered at the mansion. The idea of the big Hollywood producer shaping the career of an unknown actress may have been taken from the relationship between David O. Selznick and Jennifer Jones. Selznick and Jones did marry and remained together until his death. In this story, Shields has no intention of marrying Georgia. At one point she asks him, Would you marry me? and Shields classically replies Not even a little bit!. Georgia's obsession with her legendary actor father is the tired reason for her alcoholism and the 'bout with the bottle' takes up too much time in a sequence which can be best described as 'cliched'. The sequence is not however without its classic moments Shields dumping Georgia in the pool and the completely over the top 'almost' car accident where Georgia speeds away from the Shields mansion after finding him with his latest bimbo.Equally uninviting is the third sequence, narrated by Dick Powell's James Lee Bartlow. It's hard to believe that Gloria Grahame won the Best Supporting Oscar for her role as Bartlow's Southern Belle wife. It's not a difficult part but since it was perhaps so different from characters Grahame was usually cast as, that's why they gave it to her. The focus is usually on the rise of actors in Hollywood films so it's refreshing to see the story of how a writer becomes successful. But most of the 'Bartlow' sequence is slow-moving, especially the tedious scene at Bartlow's home. Without its one 'shocking' scene, the entire sequence probably would not have worked at all&#x97;and that's the revelation of Gaucho and Rosemary Bartlow's death in the plane crash, very reminiscent of the death of Clark Gable's wife, Carole Lombard. Before Bartlow becomes alienated from Shields (after Shields inadvertently blurts out that it was his idea for Rosemary to go with Gaucho on the plane trip), there's an excellent scene where Van Ellstein resigns as director on one of Shield's big pictures. It's the type of personality clash that still happens often in Hollywood.The cast of 'The Bad and the Beautful' are equally wonderful. I particularly liked Gus, Georgia's over emotional agent, played by Sammy White. Kirk Douglas is excellent as Jonathan Shields although it should be noted that the part of Shields is just as much protagonist as antagonist. This is no 'poison pen' letter to Hollywood at all. As alluded to before, Shields administers 'tough love' to his minions and as Walter Pidgeon points out to the three 'supplicants', they all owed their careers to Jonathan Shields.'The Bad and the Beautiful' is a well-made film with top notch performances. It could have been a classic except that it descends into melodrama and falls victim to slow pacing once it reaches its midpoint.

With apologies to Miss Grahame, who did some fine work over the years, this does not seem deserved. As the story of the rise, fall and rise again of a ruthless producer widely believed to be modeled on David Selznick, it is no more than a series of cliches and in-jokes. As I am not a fan of either I was not particularly amused. Kirk Douglas is unbelievable in the leading role. He can portray torment and ambition, but not brilliance. In private life he may well be brilliant, but this doesn't come across on the screen. There's nothing of the entrepeneur or impressario about him; and no sense of the businessman. He seems at all times like an actor playing a part. Lana Turner is marginally better. Barry Sullivan is bland as a director, and the normally capable Dick Powell cannot overcome a bad case of miscasting in his performance as a pipe-puffing Southern writer (not based on Faulkner, I hope). In any case, Barton Fink this ain't. My sense is that the movie is popular for its in references, the thinly veiled depictions of real life Hollywood folk, the sheer fun that movie insiders and outsiders have connecting all the dots.

Realize it's been around a long time, but never watched it all the way through. It just seemed hard to get into before, but was in the mood to check it out this time. Like most viewers, I have favorite segments. I agree that it is dated and not in the classic line at all. But in 1952 it was probably a big splash because it was different for the era (maybe even considered a bit racy), and probably compared more favorably with other films of the year.I don't begrudge Gloria Grahame her Oscar for her supporting role. Again, she may have compared more favorably with other supporting actresses that year. But I think she is a skillful actress (did stage work as well), and am glad she received recognition. She has played a range of characters from a gangster moll to that nut-job in Oklahoma. Sometimes actors are awarded for a role that may not be their best, but were passed over the previous year(s) due to a crowded field. That has been said about some lead players with their awards.I liked Dick Powell in this better than anything I have seen of him. It caused me to perk up and watch closely, which I have never done with him before. Maybe it's his character in this, but his portrayal was pleasing to me. He was a strong type, but did seem to be very easily swerved by his wife, but that was the script. And maybe it's not a weakness for a man to give way to his wife to please her. It really didn't seem to weaken him overall. Regardless, his character had a lot of appeal to me.It has been said that this was some of Lana Turner's best work. A line about her character in the film echoes my take on her as an actress in general. It's when Shields (Douglas) comments on her character's poor audition, saying that he wanted her for his lead part anyway because she had star power. He said that as bad as she was in the audition, every eye was on her in her scene. It seems that people become fascinated with some personalities and will flock to see anything with them in it. They just have a draw. Many of these are not really very good performers, even though they are around long enough to pick up some awards. They get lots of chances to hit, being kept at work in film after film because of their box office draw.One reviewer commented that he thought he spotted Kim Novak as the girl provided by the studio as a date for Gaucho (Roland). IMDb carries a full cast and crew list, which lists the uncredited actors. She did not appear in the list. I have noticed on some actors' list of movies that they were in a lot of early movies in bit parts that were uncredited. They still list those films in their lineup, or others do about them. It's a good way to find out who played a part by checking the full cast and crew list. In this case the Blonde Dancing with Gaucho (uncredited) is listed as Lucy Knoch. I can see a resemblance. I was curious about the Lila actress, the nasty dame who slinked down the stairway, casting the shadow across Georgia's face as she hugged Shields. It was Elaine Stewart &#x96; again, someone attractive who never did much else. And spotting Barbara Billingsley as the wardrobe coordinator was sharp on one reviewer's part. I would have missed her. Interesting to check out these bit players sometimes. "}{"Title":"Maybe I like to be cheap once in a while!

Selznick, Johanthan Shields who really chews up the carpet and screen in almost every scene he's in. Even when he's just standing still and not as much as saying a word.Shields in a self-imposed exile in Paris France is eager to come back to Tinseltown where for a while he was the most respected and biggest producer in Hollywood. Trying to get three people who's careers he single handedly guided to super star stardom actress Georgia Lorrison, Lana Turner, director Fred Amiel, Barry Sullivan, and screen writer James Lee Bartlow, Dick Powell, to work on his big comeback motion picture all Shields gets from them is snide and insulting responses.It's then the movie goes into flashback mode where we see what kind of relationship Shields had with the three that got them to dislike the man so much. As for director Fred Amiel Shields screwed him out of his pet project Faraway Mountain that won a half dozen Academy Awards, including best picture, by giving the director credits to a much more established film maker who had nothing at all to do with directing the film. There's Georgia Lorrison who was a part-time actress and full time drunk whom Sheilds guided to the very top as the most sought after actress in Hollywood but dropped Georgia for the floozy Lila, Elaine Stewart, when she started getting on his nerves by her wanting him to marry her. Then finally there's Pulitzer Prize winning writer James Lee Bartlow, Dick Powell, who did his best work under Shields' guidance but at the cost of Bartlow's southern belle wife Rosemary's, Gloria Grahame, life. Feeling that Rosemary was hindering Bartlow's writing style , by always being around him, Shields had her strike up a hot and heavy affair with Latlin Lover type Victor Gaucho Ribera, Glibert Roland, that ended in disaster. The two lovers died on a secret plane trip to Acapulco, very probably to get married, when the airplane crash into the Sierra Madre Mountain range. When Bartlow found out that Sheilds secretly arranged the fatal plane trip he ended up laying Shields out with a straight right to his dimpled chin! ****SPOILERS*** Despite everything sleazy about him there's somewhat of a happy ending in the movie for Johantan Shield! That's when the three after turning down his offer to work with him eavesdrop on a telephone conversation he's having with film producer and good friend, probably the only friend he has left in the world, Harry Pebbel, Walter Pidgeon, about his new project and seem to be grudgingly interested in being part of it!Kirk Douglas really lets it all out in the movie by griding his teeth jutting out his chin, as if changeling you to hit it, as well as making himself crazy especially in the last scene he's in with Lana Turner that will take your breath away in just how off the wall he really is! The clean shaven Douglas also grows a mustache more then half-way through the film to show that time passed which wasn't really that effective since he could have grown it any time he wanted to during the duration of the movies storyline which took 18 years.

The main character, a freshly dead, underhanded, exploitative Broadway producer, was adapted into a living, vainglorious Hollywood producer desperate for a return in a versatile, restless performance by eternal youth Kirk Douglas.In Hollywood, screenwriter Dick Powell, played with an exacting self-honesty despite his old-fashioned style, movie star Lana Turner and director Barry Sullivan each decline to speak by phone to Douglas' Jonathan Shields. A movie producer played with Walter Pidgeon's unfettered naturalness urges them to help Shields out. The subsequent segmented chronicles are narrated in recollection. In each retrospective, Shields' extravagant life is seen through their eyes. Their careers have profited from working with him, but each of them also undergo an intimate expense. Jonathan estranges, cons, deceives, abandons, and almost consumes each of them in his own egocentric, legendary ascent to his peak.This was one of the first in an extensive sequence of films, some acerbic and disparaging, that lampooned, speared or studied the making of films on the gaudy Hollywood back lot, including the same year's and studio's Singin' in the Rain, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, Truffaut's Day for Night, Kazan's The Last Tycoon, Robert Altman's The Player, and sundry more. This one is a melodrama, but director Vincente Minnelli separates his love of romantic fantasy from his ability to identify with the whole spectrum of human gray area, yet there is much veiled satire Indeed, Dick Powell's novel about early Virginia provides a wealthy opportunity for it. We deliberately determine that this serious work is a commercial work. It promises its celebrity with a liberal peppering with sex, and the film version is decidedly trite with a man in a gray Confederate uniform is pecking with a heroine. The Bad and the Beautiful submits that romances of the Old South merely sell the tackiest sentimental delusions. This Minnelli endeavor also sees making B-Movie Westerns as among the least notable enterprises in Hollywood. And budding star Lana Turner's first movie role associates trade novels with tasteless teasing and garish mise-en-scene.Alternately, there are tremendous insights into the creative process, such as when Shields proposes the concept of scaring people by uncertainty and shadows when called on to make a thriller influenced by the actual film Cat People. This inspired episode is realized with various lighting transitions, including turning a switch on and off and moving a lamp. The scene's intricacy is assured by its long-take camera movement, and its visceral effect is imprinted fleetingly in other moments Lights going on and off in the screening room cause the window from the projection booth to start or stop working as a mirror. We see the heroine's image show and vanish in the window.There is a party at a mansion where an enthralling tracking shot furnishes an elaborate evolution through the crowd, each of the extras having their own clique of goings-on and intellectual dialogue. Candelabra are everywhere. On the set of a movie wedding scene, there is a checkerboard floor, 19th Century dress uniforms, Christian symbolism. On another film set, a huge chandelier is over a dining room table, statues present. Another film set shows a revolution, opening with special effects men adding smoke. All the studio shooting set pieces are roped off from the real world. Their style is found in movie sets, not day to day. A few extras get to wear white tie and tails, but none of the outer movie's focal male characters ever do.Gloria Grahame won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this Hollywood melodrama, in which she plays a status-seeking wife, pressing her screenwriter husband to move to Hollywood and live a more lavish rank. But Kirk Douglas finds that she is distracting to her husband's screen writing. Despite her unmistakable sexy grandiosity and childlike enthusiasm, his award was clearly for her earlier work, as she hardly gets to do anything here but babble on in a Southern accent in the periphery of a few shots in the latter half of the film. But whatever she does, it's certainly a refreshment to see her in the interval dividing Lana Turner's screen time, because unlike Grahame, Turner does not, in her impersonal approach, appear to have any internal dynamics (as well as any reason for Jonathan to be coaching her on how to alluringly smoke a cigarette for her movie when her role is in a historical picture asva peasant princess). But overall, this is a fascinating film.

And that's appropriate enough, because this is a film about film-making, a fictional insider's view of four main characters a director, an actress, a writer, and a producer. Oh, and the fifth and main character, Jonathan Shields, played by Kirk Douglas, who is all of these, and most of all, a driving inspiration to the others.It might be fun to have seen how William Wyler (the consummate Hollywood director of this time) or Douglas Sirk (the consummate melodrama director) would have handled the same material. Or even how Joseph L. Mankiewicz, with all his witty intelligence, might have (he liked working with Douglas, it seems). I say all this because Vincente Minnelli, with a decade of growing successes behind him, directs this new one with finesse, creating an elegant masterpiece of film-making that falls short of being legendary most of all from its finesse. It's too polished, too well balanced, too considered throughout. And yet it's a really terrific movie, not to be missed.It's odd to make a distinction between an incredible movie, like say Strangers on a Train or Sunset Blvd and a merely nearly great one, like The Bad and the Beautiful (or, to keep the parallels going, The Detective Story and the very comparable All About Eve). All these movies were made within a year of each other, and the best show a director's genius for rising above, and the others show a more communal genius, or an ability to work together within the system and create uncompromisingly excellent films, but films that somehow lack, at least a little, the edge, or the originality, or the surprise, of a timeless great.All of which is debatable, of course, but watch this one and give it a thought. Minnelli makes no mistakes, setting us up, then leading us one by one through the three main stories. Each story works on its own, and makes a kind of three reel tale within a tale. But even within each of these the other two stories start to pop into place, and the intertwining is subtle and flawless. You might even sit up suddenly and realize, hey, that's the person from the previous section. And it all flows together, and of course needs to conjoin this way because in fact the three stories are all the same large tale built around the legendary, difficult director/producer played by Douglas. And Douglas is a continuing marvel of ease and agitation, of charm and selfishness. As an actor he's nearly always wonderful, and here he is at his best.Will you cry? Will you fret at the hanging ending--if you think it's hanging at all? Will you be infected by the movie somehow in your head the next day, the next week? You might not, not all three. But you'll smile and laugh and really marvel at how terrific it all is as it goes. As a celebration of Hollywood's excess and greed and grinding machinations the movie takes no prisoners. But it really is a celebration of the three survivors (or four, if you include the producer who guides us through it all). And an acknowledgement that there are victims throughout, and sometimes those who lose are the ones with the most to give, and the most to lose.In the end, like the three characters, we are disgusted and yet can't help listening in, because of the inglorious magic.

The first classic shot is when Lana Turner is doing her character's powerfully emotional final scene in the movie she's shooting. Our camera perspective pulls back from that shooting-scene-in-progress to show all the surrounding production staff and crew hands all in rapt attention.Just check out all the perfectly positioned people in that scene, and how dramatically lit the scene is as the camera plays up and around the assembled workers!

The problem, as illustrated in three lengthy flashbacks, is that all the talent feel they've been hosed by Douglas in the past.Douglas inherited his father's crummy B picture studio and made it Big in Hollywood terms -- that is, big in quality, big in gross. He lifted Sullivan out of obscurity, then dumped him unceremoniously in favor of better-known directors. Sullivan went on to a successful career of his own but still resents his rough handling.Turner was a drunken wannabe talent, wasted on booze, mooning over the portrait of her father who was a great star of the silver screen. Douglas shakes her out of her lifelong funk by dumping her in the swimming pool and coaxing a magnificent performance out of her before dumping her for some bit-playing whore. She goes on to become a box office star.The last story belongs to Powell as a Southern college professor whose novel has just won a Pulitzer. Douglas tricks him and his cooing Southern belle wife, Gloria Grahame, into moving to Hollywood and writing a screenplay. The giddy Grahame present difficulties. She's always interrupting Powell and he gets no work done. Douglas hauls Powell away in seclusion to finish the script and secretly arranges for the notorious womanizer, Gilbert Roland, to keep Grahame happy in Powell's absence. Grahame and Roland are accidentally killed and when Powell finds out about the sub rosa arrangement he belts Douglas and goes on to a successful career as novelist and screenwriter.The plot is taut. There's hardly a wasted moment or an adventitious word. This relentless plot adds polish to the story but makes the film look and sound like the carefully executed Hollywood production that it is. I don't think a Pulitzer Prize winner like Powell would (or could) have written it. Faulkner couldn't do it. Compare it, if you feel like it, to On the Waterfront, for an example of what I mean, released two years later.A certain gloss to a production isn't necessarily bad. This is a smooth machine and if we can see things coming from a considerable distance, so what? Kirk Douglas's character is fascinating. He lives almost entirely for the movies he produces. His attitude towards everyone around him is dispassionate, almost surgical. And when he himself directs a movie that doesn't work, he shelves it, although the move means near bankruptcy. I shouldn't have shot the movie, says Douglas, I should have shot myself. He's no more gentle with his self esteem than he is with anyone else's.Douglas is good in the role of the unscrupulous operator, of course. That phoniness behind the grin and the dimpled chin seems almost built into his persona. He's made a career out of being con men. Along with The Big Heat, this is Gloria Grahame's best performance too. It's a little hard to imagine Lana Turner going on to a big career after her encounter with Douglas, just as it is hard in real life. Maybe I'm picky but aside from The Postman Always Rings Twice, she always embarrassed me when she was on screen.The rest of the supporting cast is made up of old reliables who cannot be critiqued. What are you going to do -- complain about the performance of Walter Pidgeon as the dignified, well-meaning, nervously fidgeting, money-managing courier between Douglas and the others?

It's the charm, magic and otherwordly emotion of a studio movie set, or &#x96; the flip-side &#x96; the seedy underbelly of greed, ambition and betrayal. 'The Bad and the Beautiful (1952)' is an excellent drama about Hollywood, but it's not quite on par with the similar show-business satires of previous years, particularly Mankiewicz's 'All About Eve (1950)' which concerned the stage, but tread similar territory and Wilder's 'Sunset Blvd. (1950).' Perhaps the difference lies in director Vincente Minnelli, whose work is as graceful and professional as ever, but who is quite obviously an optimist he loves Hollywood, and can't bring himself to despise all that it represents. Whereas Billy Wilder apparently hated everyone and everything, lending 'Sunset Blvd.' its legendary bitter edge, Minnelli looks down upon his disgraced producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) not with hatred, nor even pity, but almost admiration &#x96; as a misunderstood genius making a final hopeful bid for redemption. Unlike that Gothic grotesque Norma Desmond, it seems that Shields' return will be a success.'The Bad and the Beautiful' employs a similar storytelling device to 'All About Eve (1950),' telling its story almost entirely via noirish flashbacks. Three successful artists &#x96; a director, actress and writer &#x96; arrive at the home of Jonathan Shields, the disgraced Hollywood producer to whom each of the three owes their monumental success. So why do they loathe him? Shields gave director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) his big break in cinema, worked with him to great acclaim, and then shut him out of his dream project, a 'Gone with the Wind'-like epic called The Faraway Mountain. Georgia Larisson (Lana Turner) was likewise plucked from obscurity, rescued from a lifetime of self-loathing sex and alcoholism, before being abandoned in her moment of triumph. Novelist James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell, in another great dramatic role) already had some acclaim, but also the hindrance of distracting Southern belle wife Rosemary (Gloria Grahame). Though he couldn't possibly have foreseen the consequences of his actions, Shields took care of that, as well.Each of the three owes their livelihood to Jonathan Shields, and I think that this is the true root of their hatred they're eternally in debt to him, and like Faust, feel as though they have traded their souls for a room at the top. Kirk Douglas portrays Shields wonderfully, and in the film's most searing moment, he explodes into a fit of rage, his short, stocky stature seeming to inflate as his antagonism grows. But Shields isn't really as inherently bad as the film's title would have you believe. He is presented as a flawed genius, whose personal shortcomings stem from the same artistic vein as that which fuels his cinematic intuition (a Graham Greene quote clarifies my meaning he once described himself as having a character profoundly antagonistic to ordinary domestic life, and that unfortunately, the disease is also one's material). Indeed, Shields was modelled on several filmmakers, most noticeably Val Lewton (whose 'Cat People (1942)' gets an indirect reference), Orson Welles, and David O. Selznick, whose box-office flop 'Duel in the Sun (1946)' also exhausted considerable funding and several directors.

To begin, each character is so perfectly written and performed that only Vincente Minnelli could have been the director. Kirk Douglas as Johnathan Shields was unbelievably excellent. Johnathan felt like a real person and the way Douglas played him the character came to life. Lana Turner was fantastic as Georgia Lorrison. Even in silence, Turner brought something so special to Georgia that no actress would ever be able to bring the character justice again. Turner and Douglas were certainly deserving of an Academy Award for their brilliant acting performances and it is a crime that Turner was completely snubbed. To boot, Minnelli was denied an Oscar nod along with the film as a whole for Best Picture. Gloria Grahme however was honored with an Academy Award for her delightful and refreshingly sanguine portrayal of Rosemary. However, I don't think Grahme was not on the screen more than 10 minutes. Is that really deserving of a prestigious award like an Oscar? Even so, The Bad and the Beautiful is pure excellence and a film that all movie lovers should experience. The drama is intense and every moment that the stars are on screen is magnificence.

Unusually constructed around three separate lengthy flashbacks of past associates (a director, actress and writer, played by Barry Sullivan, Lana Turner and Dick Powell) of boy-genius Jonathan Shields (a composite, perhaps of David O Selznick and Orson Welles) played with total conviction and no little vigour by an emergent Kirk Douglas, these serve to lay bare, warts and all, his larger than life character by the conclusion, leaving the viewer to decide for themselves whether this golden boy with feet of clay is deserving of our admiration or derision. Of course we're steered in the former direction not only by Douglas's terrific performance but also by the clever concluding scene when Sullivan, Turner and Powell, all with ample reason to have nothing do with him, still find themselves effortlessly drawn into his comeback plans. The film is a celebration of errant genius with an appreciation that such talents are frequently flawed in character and cause casualties along the way. The acting is uniformly excellent even though Douglas' name should really be above Turner's in the titles, given the relative scale of their parts, never mind their performances. Besides the leads mentioned above, Gloria Grahame shines again as the fey Southern belle wife of the unexciting pragmatic writer played by Powell, swept off her feet by a Latin smoothie set up by Shields. Minnelli's direction is effortless, purveying numerous backstage insights on and off-camera. The story itself is highly melodramatic and improbable but nevertheless extremely entertaining and to paraphrase Bette Davis in the near contemporary classic All About Eve, certainly a movie to strap in tight for, a bumpy ride is had by all.

Unfortunately, they all were tragically affected by him in one way or another, so they all refuse. If anything, this movie shows how quickly your fortune can turn in the movie business. Jonathan Shields, played remarkably by Kirk Douglas, goes from poor, unknown movie producer, to becoming one of the richest and most powerful men in Hollywood. This film reminded me of a sort of mix between Sunset Blvd. and Ace in the Hole, ironically the latter being a film in which Douglas also starred in and playing the same type of character. Taking a rather unflinching look at the inner workings of film making and the consequences that come about from such a lavish lifestyle, Minnelli paints a bleak portrait of the people we think have it all. It may not be as powerful or well made as Sunset Blvd, but it still has a great quality to it that makes it one of the better works of Vincente Minnelli.

That is why we come here and write our reviews and read other peoples opinions of them. But to make a site like this possible we need to have the finished article on our screens, and these movies are presented in such a way that they seem effortless. Never once are we to imagine that the whole scene is just a set, and the characters on screen are merely paid actors.The Bad and the Beautiful breaks that mould. For once we are shown the true gritty realism of what goes on behind the cameras. The studio systems, the dodgy and sometimes sleazy wheeler dealing's and the heartbreak and high running passions that go into making a motion picture. In short it is a movie about movie making.When a Director, an Actress and a Writer are called into the office of movie Mogul Harry Pebbel (Walter Pigeon) they are told that movie producer Jonathan Sheilds has fallen on hard times. He plans to make a come back but requires their combined talents to pull it off.However all four of them have had extensive dealings with Sheilds in the past and have all vowed never to even talk to him again let alone work with him. Each have their own reasons as each have suffered at Sheilds' hands.The rest of the picture is told in three individual flashbacks as it is explained just how and why Sheilds deserves such animosity, with Pebbels also explaining just what they all went on to achieve because of him and in spite of him.The Director is Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) who started out as Sheilds' partner when they were a young Producer/Director team finding it hard to land a job. They have a very close friendship and make very low budget 'B' pictures. When the two men finally land a job with Harry Pebbel's studio, their pictures start to acquire success and with that comes the ambition to produce bigger and better projects.The two decide to take on Amiel's dream project and translate a best selling novel to the screen. Amiel has written a solid screenplay and longs more than anything to direct it. Requiring a big budget and 'A' list stars, the two of them pull out all the stops to get the necessary backing from the studio.It pays off but in the negotiations Amiel is all but dropped from the project, instead opting for a better known and more experienced Director. Sheilds however rides his ambition and signs on for the project despite the railroading of his best friend, and with Sheilds' star on the rise, the two end their partnership and their friendship on a bitter and acrimonious note.The Actress is Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), the daughter of one of the early movie stars, who's tortured passed she hides behind a bottle. Despite her drunken exterior, Sheilds who now owns his own production company and studio, sees the potential for a star quality leading lady and signs her on for his next picture.During the preparation for the picture she falls in love with Sheilds. This coupled with the pressure of her first major role is too much for her, so once again she finds solace in drink which threatens to destroy the project.As a way of keeping Lorrison on track, Sheilds convinces her that he too is in love, and helps her develop as the actress she undoubtedly is. However when the film is released and Lorrison becomes the new Hollywood sensation, Sheilds drops her like a hot potato, an act made even more callous by the fact he is already with another woman and had probably been so all the time.The Writer is James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) a southern intellectual who's first book has just been published and Sheilds intends to adapt it for the screen. After flying Bartlow and his wife out to Hollywood, Sheilds convinces him to write the screenplay as well.Bartlow is a happily married man who's home-life has always come first, however Sheilds believes that his wife is interfering with his work, so he engages his dashing leading man 'Goucho' (played by Gilbert Roland) to turn on his Latin charm and seduce the lady away from her husband while the screenplay is finished.This has tragic results as Goucho and Mrs Bartlow are killed in a plane crash, while running away to Mexico together so she can get a quick divorce and marry her new found Latin lover.Unaware that it was Sheilds' scheming that resulted in the infidelity and ultimate death of his wife, he finds solace in Sheilds and the two finally become close friends until the truth is finally unearthed.Kirk Douglas gives what is in my opinion his greatest performance as the selfish and scheming Jonathan Sheilds, especially in the scenes with Lana Turner. His power and emotion was so much deserving of the 1952 Oscar which finally went to Gary Cooper in High Noon.Although selfish and egotistical, hes not necessarily a bad man. He had his moments of kindness, he genuinely was remorseful over the death of Bartlow's wife and in an earlier scene, he speaks of how he wanted to make a star out of someone Hollywood had thrown onto the Ash pile. A boy who made good, wanting to give something back.He would lie, cheat, sacrifice and tread on anybody's heels to get his pictures on the screen, but he is not evil through and through, like most cinematic baddies and indeed like some of the real Hollywood producers who were out there at that time.Yet with all, thanks to Douglas' perfect performance, Jonathan Sheilds is destined to remain one of cinemas most loathsome and despicable characters "},{"Title":"How it really works in Hollywood, when it works.","Date":"6 March 1999","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I know now where Martin Scorsese originally got his passion for the film business.

But this is no derivative Jackie Collins-style potboiler with cardboard cut-outs as characters. Ignited by Kirk Douglas's terrifically brutal performance as Shields, the film is incessantly watchable - similar in structure and perspective to Orson Welles's Citizen Kane - as the story tracks his rise to the top and fall from grace through three primary relationships - the first with Fred Amiel, a director with whom Shields partners early in their careers, the second with Georgia Lorrison, an alcoholic bit player and daughter of a Hollywood legend whom Shields grooms to become a big star, and the third with James Lee Bartlow, a writer whom Shields tries to make a screenwriter in spite of the constant interruptions by Bartlow's southern belle wife Rosemary.Filmed in a rich black-and-white by veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees, the film is slick and penetrating at the same time, a deep-dive character study of not only Shields but the people who come to admire his tenacity and creativity only to be betrayed by his lack of character. Composer David Raksin's music perfectly underlines the emotional pull of the movie. Minnelli has assembled a great cast to embody the story. Ever resourceful with his trademark dimpled granite chin, Douglas does not make Shields a complete villain but rather an intriguingly textured opportunist. You want to hate him but thanks to Douglas's natural charisma, you can't deny how he opened the right doors for the people around him. Ideally cast as Georgia in what is likely her career-best performance, Lana Turner is surprisingly effective in what must have been quite a stretch for her meager acting talents - from pathetic drunk to clinging starlet to haughty diva.Longtime leading man Dick Powell and familiar character actor Barry Sullivan respectively portray Bartlow and Amiel with precision and an alternating sense of brotherly obligation and resentment toward Shields. In a manner similar to the way he portrayed Ziegfeld in William Wyler's later Funny Girl, Walter Pigeon plays production executive Harry Pebbel with stentorian fervor. Aging matinée idol Gilbert Roland has an archetypal role as an actor who believes his own image as a Latin lover, and in a few brief scenes, Gloria Grahame fluidly captures Rosemary's purposeful flightiness and veiled frustration. You can even spot Beaver's mom Barbara Billingsley playing a frustrated costume designer scolding Georgia on the way she walks in her creation.Minnelli has concocted some really great scenes, especially the open-ended conclusion. The best, however, has to be when Georgia finds a tawdry starlet (played acerbically by Elaine Stewart, who much later became a game show hostess) descending the stairs at Shields' mansion at which point she flees and drives with Hollywood-style abandon in her car. While it's fun to speculate on who is playing who within Hollywood lore, e.g., Shields as the doppelganger David O. Selznick, Georgia as Diana Barrymore (daughter of John), the characterizations are so rich that the guessing game is secondary. The DVD includes an interesting 90-minute TCM documentary on Turner, who apparently led a life more scandalous and lascivious than anyone in the movie.

Jean Hagen most certainly deserved the Supporting Actress honor for her APPROPRIATE comedic turn as an over-the-top, unfortunately voiced silent film actress in Singing in the Rain. And, folks, that scene with an hysterical Lana Turner driving in the rain is, well, HYSTERICAL.VM was an excellent director, but some of his films, especially the overwrought melodramas, simply do not hold up. Yes, they always look great, but often the performances in the dramas are of the scenery-chewing variety.In regards to another user's post, I agree that the scenario of Powell's character identifying his wife is ridiculous. The same thought immediately crossed my mind when seeing it for the first time.My feelings towards Douglas's performance are mixed.

Actors, directors, film crew, writers - they toil for years in b-pictures for a chance on a big-scale epic, but some get there and some don't. And some people's word don't mean much to those who look out for themselves. Kirk Douglas is one such movie-maker whose director/producer father died and left him penniless, but he vows to ram the name of Shields down the throat of Hollywood. He befriends director Barry Sullivan, who is tongue-tied when he tries to sell himself, but associating with the egomaniac Kirk helps him with his career. Enter Lana Turner who is the daughter of a much loved and respected actor, who's also dead, but she now drinks and does bit parts and toils and drudges on, until Kirk meets her. Walter Pidegon is a producer who invests in minor horror movies, but gets into mega money when investing into a major artistic film, courtesy of Kirk and Barry. Dick Powell wrote a best-selling novel which Hollywood is making into a major motion picture, but Kirk needs him to write the screenplay. Will he get him? Dick's wife, Gloria Grahame, tries to let him work, but always seems to be taking up a lot of his time. This film shows all the struggles and dreams of those in Hollywood without passing judgment on them. Director Vincente Minnelli had a way of taking a subject matter, putting it on celluloid, and making it not only entertaining but making it feel like it came from the Smithsonian museum, like it was art on a wall. But he does have the aid of all the technicians from the departments at the peak of the craft. But under his watch, they all must past muster, and they all come in grade-A fashion. The story of how Kirk Douglas affects the lives and careers of those around him is told in three major sections the first by the point of view of Barry, then it's Lana's perspective, and thirdly, Dick Powell. This film won 5 out of 6 Oscars, only losing Kirk's acting award. But Gloria Grahame, who was in the film for not even 10 minutes, did win. Some say she won for giving good performances in all the movies she made in 1952 and not only this one, but this is the really big, prestigious, and respected one she made that year. She is very memorable as a flirty wife, with an insatiable appetite. I can't believe I've never reviewed this film, as I am a big Lana Turner fan; I guess I thought I had nothing to add. But from day one that I saw this film years ago, I was hooked. The day I saw it, I watched it three times in a row that same day. That is very rare for me. One of the other very few films I've seen in that way is Sudden Fear, another 1952 film with Gloria Grahame, in which she excels. All the stars of The Bad and the Beautiful are great and the aesthetics are superlative. And, that car scene of Lana's is a personal highlight. And, yes, that's actor John Houseman who helped to produce this film. And, Charles Schnee wrote the screenplay and won an Oscar for his eloquent (just listening to the words as they speak is an experience, especially Gloria Grahame in her southern belle accent) and three-dimensional treatment of Hollywood at its best and worst.

If they could ever bottle it, it will outsell ginger ale.","Date":"25 February 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Who is Jonathan Shields? That is the story Vincente Minnelli drama is trying to tell. There is a Orson Welles 'Citizen Kane' feel to the film, as there are three stories told about Jonathan Shields through eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative and tells Shield's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from people that Shield done wrong to. The movie starts in Hollywood, screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell), movie star Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), and director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) has been gather up by movie producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) to help Jonathan Shields (Kurt Douglas) with his newest movie, but each refuse, and tells Harry the reason why. The movie has a unreliable narrator to it, with each narrator recounts a different part of Shield's life, with each story partly overlapping follows a natural progression of events as Shields rises to fame. The movie is so like 'Kane', some critics are calling it 'Citizen Shields'. Each person's story is an act; so three people equal, three acts. The first narrator is the director that tells the story how Kurt Douglas launched his career with his help. The second act is told by the actress whom is the daughter of an also-failed father that become a strong and talented actress through Shields work. And the third act is taking a novelist and turning him into a credible and successful screenwriter. It's an amalgamation of so many stories that had been whirling around the industry for years. For some people, they believe Lana Turner's character is based on Diana Barrymore or Judy Garland. Kirk Douglas's Jonathan Shields is mixed with David O' Selznick, Darryl F. Zanuck & Val Lewton. Barry Sullivan's Fred Amiel on George Cukor of Gone to the Wind fame. For Dick Powell's character James Lee Bartlow, it's believe to be inspired by novelist Paul Eliot Green, William Faulkner or F. Scott Fitzgerald. Even the supporting cast might be based on real life characters such as supporting character Gilbert Roland whom play Gaucho might be a self-parody, but in my opinion I have a feeling it's based on Porfirio Rubirosa or better yet silent star Rudolph Valentino. Henry Whitfield (Leo G. Carroll) is mirroring Alfred Hitchcock. The three main actors (Turner, Powell, and Sullivan) are great in their roles. Everybody was outstanding in this film but Kirk Douglas stole the show. Kirk Douglas is great as the main role, playing the corrupt and amoral head of a major film studio in this Hollywood drama. For 1950's film, this movie has a lot of depth and comedy into it, that works. I was surprised to see the movie have women characters being alcoholic and sex addicts, rather than the charm roles they normally get in the films in those days. Supporting character Rosemary (Gloria Grahame) is one of those women characters. She was pretty funny in the role, but I don't agree that Gloria Grahame should have won the Oscar that year with her limited screen time,her ludicrous fake southern accent, as well, as the other actress who done better that year. Plenty of on-screen chemistry, tension and great casting make this film an outstanding drama. The only faults of the film are terms of its picture quality. We get a very nice, smooth looking transfer with much of the film grain and age related artifacts cleaned up. But there are moments where edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are so bad, you just can't help but get distracted away from the fine performances taking place underneath all that digital mess. When the image is free from these anomalies, contrast and black levels are superb. I also love the music. David Raksin, a marvelous composer as the film sports a jazzy and haunting tone similar to his later works in 'Laura'. Still this arrangement is over arranged and composer know his Jazz voicing but forgot a forceful melody line to add to it. Something like Cake decorations without the cake. Still, it's a cake worth eating. Check this movie out, for a great insight look at Hollywood.

I also like the movie's architecture, using the three flashbacks to show why Douglas might still win them back despite his abuse of the three ex-employees. It's an appropriately ambiguous upshot to the story as a whole. I'm not sure, however, that I buy the Turner flashback. His rejection of her appears both too calculated and too vicious given their prior relationship. Anyhow, it's a slickly made, entertaining film that may not reach Sunset Blvd. (1950) in candor, but still has its compensations.

To resurrect it, he tries to get three former collaborators (Barry Sullivan, Lana Turner and Dick Powell), all of whom he screwed over royally, to work with him again. This starts off great, and is easily one of the best Hollywood stories ever told by Hollywood. I kind of got bored with it a little as it went on, though. In particular, all three of the stories told in flashback are pretty identical, and by the time we get to the third one I was thinking it felt unnecessary. I also don't think much of Lana Turner (who is actually the subject of the second story). Douglas is at his very best, though, and Minnelli's direction is ace. Gloria Graham appears late in the picture as Powell's wife. She won an Oscar for it somehow. She's totally forgettable. The Academy could have waited a year and handed her one for The Big Heat.

If we are to go by the film's proposition, film producers in charge of large companies feed off of others before shamelessly claiming the credit and enjoying the revelling in all the cash that brings in the process. To say the film is a one trick pony would be too harsh-a criticism but it isn't too far from the truth; its above notion regarding producers being as beastly as they are is a relatively interesting one but that is its sole idea, the core of its make up the exploration of this thesis arriving in the form of three separate stories from contrasting perspectives that ultimately might have been shorter; sharper and maybe told parallel to one another to make them more interesting, with the film most probably being as such as a result.We begin with an array of three people in separate places doing separate things receiving incoming calls from a certain movie producer, an actress and a director inform their aides with stern faces to categorically reject the voice on the other end whom wishes to communicate. The third, a writer, is, curiously enough, actually able to bring himself to speak to him down the line, unlike the other two, but again informs him precisely where he stands in really not wanting any further contact with him. That man, the movie producer, is a certain Jon Shields, a character played by Kirk Douglas; a man with a big, broad smile; a homely tone and a glowing face for the non-diegetic camera &#x96; internally, somewhat of a monster, an ugly and raw animal looking out for himself and the money he will earn in the process. The systematic rejection of the individual as a business partner henceforth tells us precisely where each tale is headed when it is we finally flashback for each account, the beginning with director Fred Amiel (Sullivan) before moving onto actress Georgia Lorrison (Turner) and then finishing with that writer named Jim Bartlow (Powell) eventually coming to formulate the heart of a film making the same point three times, but from the perspectives of three wildly differing people with roles within the film industry spanning both genders.In being able to hear each story, the three gather in Jon's office at the Shields production studio; the bevy of industry professionals gathered around one another, in front of an on-listening Shields official, talking drearily of their lifetime experiences echos that of a kind of addicts seminar. The office displays a vast amount of Oscar statuettes, but the official working there is yet to have heard of a Pulitzer Prize; something which alludes to vast degrees of success within a particular field via the awards on show, but hints at a place driven by people living the bubbled nature of their own existence - by those whom are preprogrammed to produce success after success in the film-making world but are oblivious to such accolades at the peak of sister-professions within their creative fields.Amiel's story reveals Jon as a young and enthusiastic go-getter; a man able to churn out B-movies with regularity, such is his enthusiasm, in his partnership with Amiel so as to pay off a debt. Jon appears charming and professional; throughout Amiel's strand, there is a workable sense of ambiguity in regards as to whether Shields is doing what he does out of love for films and their creation or the vast sums of money he so easily earns. Amiel is left stranded when an ambitious project gets off the ground and he is excused from directing it for a more experienced man. Lorrison's plot is more broadly linked to the myth of stardom and the celebrification of one's self through looks and what-not in the tinsel town paradise that is Hollywood; a story more inclined towards being straight up generic romance with tinges of melodrama in what is the weakest of the three but does what it sets out to do in exploring said myth and having everything end tragically. Lastly, Bartlow's tale is one that revolves around little to do with the fatuity of the film business; seeing he and a wife, whom we do not necessarily believe he would be have been married to in the first place, fall foul of Hollywood's grip which disappointingly plays out more under the watchful eye of fate than it does anything else.The film is a broad and ambitious piece, made far more watchable by Kirk Douglas' central performance as the menace Shields; Douglas playing him in a manner that sees him essentially match what it is he does in each of the three stories, an alluding to that greater extent of ruthless professionalism he embodies and that lack of remorse he so clearly has; by the time we've reached Bartlow's tale, he has near enough destroyed two separate lives - but his attitude and demeanour has stayed the same throughout and is all the more chilling because of it. The film was released at around about the time of two other famous Hollywood films about Hollywood itself, namely Sunset Blvd. and Singing in the Rain; it isn't as exciting nor does it arrive with narratives as engaging as either of those examples. Indeed, it isn't involving as something, granted, a lot more contemporary in the form of 1992's The Player; a film about a film producer whom oversteps certain marks and is drawn into danger with a disgruntled industry worker he's dealt with &#x96; three separate films we enjoy somewhat more than The Bad and the Beautiful which has merits, but falls short of anything more.

I could also have mentioned The Bad and the Beautiful, another film from 1952, as a third. Whereas Singin' in the Rain is a comedy, and Sunset Boulevard a tragedy, The Bad and the Beautiful is a melodrama.It tells the story of the rise and fall of Jonathan Shields, an autocratic film producer. The story is told in a series of flashbacks by three of Shields's former colleagues, director Fred Amiel, actress Georgia Lorrison and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow. All three were at one time not only colleagues of Shields but also his friends, and in the case of Georgia his lover. All three have now quarrelled with him, and in each case it was clearly Shields who was in the wrong. Yet although Amiel, Lorrison and Bartlow all consider that Shields has used and exploited them, their careers have not suffered as a result. All three are at the top of their professions, while it is Shields whose career is in the doldrums after his arrogant ways offended one person too many and his most recent film was a disaster.There has been a lot of speculation on this board about whether the various characters are based upon real individuals, and doubtless there was even more in 1952. Shields appears to be based upon David O. Selznick; his most successful film, The Proud Land is a Civil War epic reminiscent of Gone with the Wind. (His first success, however, was clearly based upon Val Lewton's Cat People). Georgia, whose father was also a Hollywood star, may be based upon Diana Barrymore, who was the daughter of John Barrymore and who, like Georgia in the film, suffered from drug and alcohol addiction. (Judy Garland, the ex-wife of the film's director Vincente Minnelli, has also been suggested as a model). The Latin-American actor Victor Ribera, played by Gilbert Roland, is reminiscent of a number of Latin lover stars, such as Fernando Lamas or even Roland himself. The British director Henry Whitfield may be modelled on Alfred Hitchcock, who clashed with Selznick just as Whitfield clashes with Shields. The German Von Ellstein is probably a composite of a number of German directors, such as Fritz Lang and Erich von Stroheim.The role of Shields brought Kirk Douglas the second of his three unsuccessful Best Actor nominations. (The others were for Champion and Lust for Life). Douglas is certainly on top form here as the ambitious, vain and ruthless Shields, a man who may be a success as a film-maker but is an utter failure as a human being. Nevertheless, I think that the Academy were right to give the award to Gary Cooper for High Noon, a performance that few actors could have bettered. Gloria Grahame, however, won for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, something that rather surprises me. Grahame plays Bartlow's dizzy blonde Southern Belle wife Rosemary, and, although it was interesting to see her in a role quite different from her normal femme fatale parts, this is not really her best film. (She was, for example, to be much better in The Big Heat the following year). I felt that the award should have gone to Jean Hagen for her brilliant comedic performance in Singin' in the Rain. Lana Turner as Georgia was also not at her best, being too histrionic for my taste.I would not rate The Bad and the Beautiful quite as highly as either Sunset Boulevard or Singin' in the Rain, but it is one of those films which, although nearly sixty years old, still remains highly watchable even today, both as a vivid picture of Hollywood in its Golden Age and as a psychological portrait of a megalomaniac tycoon reminiscent of Orson Welles's Charles Foster Kane. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Not bad at all","Date":"24 August 2009","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Vincente Minnelli's The Bad and the Beautiful is an 'inside Hollywood' film in the vein of Sunset Blvd..

However, unfortunately for Shields, he now finds himself a pariah following his numerous betrayals. Can former business partner Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) convince the three to reunite for the project that Shields hopes will vault him back into the spotlight?The cast is admirable. Kirk Douglas fit well in the role of a manipulative Hollywood producer and he found himself rewarded with an Oscar nomination for his performance. Lana Turner was the other headliner and she delivered the goods as well (while looking wonderful, I might add). Gloria Grahame somehow managed to snag an Oscar for her relatively minor role, though I must admit that she is memorably fetching. The rest of the cast is uniformly solid with no weak links.Minnelli's direction is lively while the film's Oscar wins for cinematography, costume design & art direction show that the film is easy on the eyes. The David Raksin score admirably supports the visuals, running the gamut from bouncy to foreboding.All in all, the film is a memorable 'inside Hollywood' yarn mixing soapy melodrama with a somewhat noirish approach. While not as satirically cutting as Sunset Blvd. it is bolstered by an Oscar-winning script. Throw in the fine cast and technical polish and you've got a film that's definitely worth watching.

Selznick who's own father Lewis J. Selznick was an early giant in the film industry. After the collapse of his father's empire and bankruptcy, young David starred his career over, from the bottom as a proof reader slowly working his way up to producing and winning Oscars for both GWTW & REBECCA.Lovely Lana Turner's character Georgia Larisson is supposedly based on the now nearly forgotten Diana Barrymore trying to make a name for herself away from her father, the legendary John Barrymore.

When told he seemed too suave and debonair to play the seedy producer, he showed up in Minnelli's office wearing a crew-cut wig and a poorly fitted suit and they said that's it! And he won the role.Leo G. Carroll's brief appearance as a demanding director is a thinly veiled reference to Alfred Hitchcock. When he first came to Hollywood, Hitchcock was under contract to producer David O. Selznick for years. Carroll had roles in many Hitchcock films of this era. The character played by Kathleen Freeman was based on Alfred Hitchcock's wife, Alma Reville.THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL was the first of four films director Vincent Minnelli would make with Kirk Douglas, the others were THE STORY OF THREE LOVES, TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN & LUST FOR LIFE.

To compete with that horrid little box that was infesting the living rooms and emptying the movie theaters of America, the big screen had to offer what television couldn't sex (ooh, bad!) and high production values (ooh, beautiful!). B&B offers as much adultery and sumptuous sets as the censors and budgets will allow while it traces the rise and fall of an amoral film producer (Kirk Douglas) as he destroys a director (Barry Sullivan), actress (Lana Turner) and writer (Dick Powell) in pursuit of cinematic immortality. Not sure if Charles Schnee (writer) and Vincent Minelli (director) meant for this movie to be quite that metafictional, but they come awfully close. Particularly postmodern is the characters' penchant for criticizing Lana Turner's performance wooden, terrible, even when you're awful, you're all the audience sees. (Indeed, that rack of hers literally and figuratively obscured many a movie set.) As Hollywood self-laceration goes, The Bad and the Beautiful presages The Player by forty years, and manages to be a far better film by upping the melodrama and burying the self-referential cleverness.Douglas' character,Jonathan Shields, is the son of some dead, disgraced studio exec who sets out to avenge his father's humiliation. The film sets a tone of gleeful cynicism by having young Shields pay complete strangers $11.00 to mourn at his father's funeral. One of the grievers-for-hire, Barry Sullivan, makes snotty comments about the dear departed but apologizes to Shields, also letting him know he's an aspiring director. Shields lures him into a filmmaking partnership, then destroys him. In the course of setting up Sullivan, he encounters Lana Turner as second-generation starlet Gloria Lorrison. She insults him, so later on he builds a big picture around her, seduces her, and destroys her. Just for fun, Shields also ruins the life of a Southern writer (Dick Powell) who rebuffs his first offer to collaborate on a movie. To its eternal credit, the movie never asks us to hate Shields -- he's a pure sociopath who barely masks his manipulations and, when discovered, doesn't even pretend he's sorry, he just tells his victims they had it coming. (And, to a certain extent, yes, they did.) B&B is also helped by Vincent Minelli's ridiculously competent filmmaking -- lovely tracking shots, beautifully evocative lighting, heart-rending orchestral swells, all the elements of great, glossy soap opera. He couldn't do much with Lana, but then again, she's not much more than a special effect and he uses her that way. Her breakdown scene while driving away from Kirk's house is so hysterically horrible that Minelli doesn't cut away to scenes of her out-of-control car careening around corners, since anything even remotely realistic would detract from the giddy unreality of her performance.

The movie is actually quite different from what you might expect. It's a strong drama that gives an insight view of the Hollywood business behind the camera's.Movie buffs will be surely able to recognize some situations, characters and movies feature within this movie. A lot of this movie seems to be based on actual persons and events, although it of course gets all so mixed in with each other a lot, so it all still works out as original as it can get.It besides gives us a great inside view of how movie-making in the '40's/'50's was done. The movie can be seen as one that goes behind the scenes, that shows how actors, producers, writer, directors and studio bosses all interact and quarrel with each other and how eventually a movie gets established.But what foremost makes The Bad and the Beautiful such a fine and original movie is its story-telling. Basically the movie has 4 different story-lines, which each featuring a different character. What they all have in common is that they once got cheated on by movie producer Jonathan Shields, played by Kirk Douglas. The stories are being told in flashback mode and in between it cuts to the 'present' time, in which the three cheated on persons are being asked to revive the career of the tough Jonathan Shields. So you could say that this movie is four for the price of one! Each storyline is one on its own, featuring new events and characters. Nevertheless the movie never starts to feel messy or overfilled. This is of course due to the presence of the Kirk Douglas character but also really thanks to its well balanced writing.The movie also won an Oscar for its screenplay. It won four more Oscar's and it also was nominated for another one. Strangely enough the movie did not receive a nomination in the best picture of best director category. It's the movie that still holds the record for most Academy Awards won by a film not nominated for best picture.The movie is really being carried by Kirk Douglas, who gives away a fine performance. In all fairness, he is a guy that mostly has done some great stuff in the '50's and early '60's, which however just weren't exactly the 'golden age' of cinema. After that he hasn't starred in any real memorable movies and he now days is better known as the father of the successful actor Michael Douglas (although his career is also already declining in these recent years). So he himself never have really been a that great star, which I think has more to do with the fact that he began rather late with acting in movies. Had he begun his career in the '30's and early '40's, he would had played surely much more great roles during his career and he himself would be better known and appreciated as an actor now days. In this movie he might very well play the best role out of his career. He plays a tough and rotten character but at the same time with a real charming touch to it.Also the other actors within this movie know to impress. The movie has a great cast, with Lana Turner, Walter Pidgeon and Dick Powell, among others. But in my opinion also a lot of credit need to go to director Vincente Minnelli for the acting performances within this movie.The movie feels old fashioned and modern at the same time. It's a movie that is mostly done in '40's style and this is also probably the reason why it got shot in black & white. It on the other hand is also really modern with its story, which must also had been quite daring for its time. What happens behind the scenes stays behind the scenes, would had most likely been the general thought of Hollywood at the time. This movie simply ignores this and gives an original and nice look from the other side of the cameras.A great movie, worth watching!8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Absorbing look at Hollywood by Minnelli, excellent performance from Douglas","Date":"11 August 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Minnelli's The Bad And The Beautiful is still great drama, even if the first 2/3 of the film far outweigh the last. Kirk Douglas is excellent as ambitious producer Jonathon Shields, who is pretty obviously based on David O. Selznick (the Shields touch is even referred to). The film opens with three people, a film director, actress and writer, who have all previously worked with and been burned by Shields, gathered around a phone to take call from Europe. The film is told largely in flashback, as we are shown Shield's rise and fall. He goes from cheap B features to big, melodramatic productions- and shunts the director who came up the idea. He rescues Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner, in perhaps her best screen performance) from a life of trampy, drunken uselessness, builds her up to be a star, then jilts her on premiere night. He woos writer Dick Powell to Hollywood, then gets his Southern belle wife Gloria Grahame killed in a plane crash. And throughout it all we are absolutely fascinated by Shields- ruthless, complicated, a perfectionist and a man born to stand out, even if his actions eventually cost him nearly everything.The Lana Turner flashback is the strongest part of the film, and the Dick Powell/Gloria Grahame part is the weakest. Grahame won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role, and while it's not a bad performance exactly, it's not a terribly interesting or challenging one either. Dick Powell has all the charisma of a wet towel. Douglas and Turner, however, make quite a great combination, and she gets a performance that is keyed exactly to her limited talents. I had a lot of fun with all the references to other films and film stars, and The Faraway Mountain seems to be quite an obvious reference to Selznick's Duel In The Sun (which I actually really like and I am not ashamed to say that I do). There has been a lot of Selznick bashing in recent years, what with his massive productions, blizzards of memo's and marriage to Jennifer Jones (who I also really like). But the guy was a savvy producer, and even if his films were critically savaged then and now, he always put on a great show.

It's the real story, exposed! Wrong. It is so full of clichés and tired old tropes, stereotypes--- everything that the public anticipates and comfortably accepts in a fictionalized story purported to be drawn on real life events and people. All the soap opera melodrama bursts out of it everywhere making scenes meant to be taken seriously more like comedic spoofs from Saturday Night Live. And the Academy honored this with a Best Screenplay Oscar for 1952!The weepy, poignant musical score by David Raksin serves as the baleful icing dripping off this collapsed cake.

Basically three successful film industry members, actress Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) and writer James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) are brought together by friend Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon). Pebbel wants them to reminisce about their time spent with ambitious Hollywood producer and director Jonathan Shields (Oscar nominated Kirk Douglas). This story is told in flashback form as one by one they talk about being with the ruthless filmmaker who they all grew to hate as they made films with him. Georgia was an up and coming unknown star and was given her first major movie star role with the help of Shields, and it turns into a good social and professional relationship, until he pursues other women. Amiel was working with Shields as director on many pictures, but then the producer starts taking more control and wants other people to take Amiel's dream project. Finally, writer Bartlow came out of college with Shields turning his novels into hit films, but then the producer/director gets a Latin movie star to go out with Mrs. Bartlow, and eventually tragedy ensues. Also starring Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Gloria Grahame as Rosemary Bartlow, Golden Globe nominated Gilbert Roland as Victor 'Gaucho' Ribera, Leo G.

The essential difference is that for Wilder Hollywood itself was the heavy, turning its back on those, like Norma Desmond, who had made millions for the industry and helped put it on the map whilst Schnee and Minnelli focus on a Human manifestation, Jonathan Shields, of a parasitic industry. In one respect this is a screen adaptation ofBudd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run (arguably the best novel about Hollywood) that never got made although Schulberg (whose father, PJ ran Paramount for several years) created a character totally bereft of redeeming qualities who would have been a louse anywhere but became an even bigger louse when he moved from New York to Hollywood, whilst Schnee gives us a second-generation louse in the shape of Jonathan Shields, Kirk Douglas, whose easy charm conceals the stiletto that has his friend's names on it. Schnee contrived a very tight and workable premise; we begin with a Shields who can't get arrested reaching out to three key people, director, writer, star, he betrayed on the way up; this gives each a chance to recall a different Shields a la Rashomon, and each a reason to reject him. If we overlook the glaring error in the final flashback - Shields has taken writer James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) to an isolated lake to finish a Treatment, prevailing upon Gaucho (Gilbert Roland) to keep Bartlow's distracting wife (Gloria Grahame) occupied whilst they are away. Roland and Grahame are killed in a plane crash and some six months later Douglas (who has, of course, to be seen as guilty) says, in a Freudian slip, 'I begged Gaucho not to take that plane'. In reality he and Powell had been isolated and Douglas could have had no knowledge of WHAT Gaucho did or didn't do - then this is a fine effort which holds up 50 years on. All the performances are out of the right bottle and three of the principals, Schnee, Minnelli and Douglas, would come together again several years later in another film about film making, based on Irwin Shaw's fine novel Two Weeks In Another Town.

With them on board, Pidgeon can raise the funding for the proposed film in seconds. But none of them will ever work with Shields again, and each one, in flashbacks, tells Pidgeon why.The acting, the plot, the dialogue, and the music are all great. What's interesting is that the film takes us behind the scenes of making a movie and working at a studio, which is fascinating as well as entertaining.The only problematic scene is an hysterical Lana driving in the rain - again - as she did in Portrait in Black.

After all, it's a film I supposed was right up my alley &#150; behind the scenes of old Hollywood, it had some actors I was excited about (Dick Powell and Gloria Grahame) and for some reason I was under the impression that it was directed by Douglas Sirk, whom I love. As the opening credits rolled, I was embarrassed to learn that it was actually a Vincente Minnelli film (I don't know where I got the crazy idea that it came from Sirk &#150; maybe the melodramatic title&#133;), which didn't dampen my spirits at all. Minnelli, probably best known for his musicals, is a very capable filmmaker and has handled some good drama in his time, namely Lust for Life. However, as the film started to unspool on my television set &#150; that's when my spirits got dampened.I can't label The Bad and the Beautiful as anything but a disappointment. Sure, my expectations were high, but I still say the film underachieves. While there are a few really good scenes (I like the scene in which Kirk Douglas is waiting for Lana Turner in her bedroom and the scene when her character films the final scene of her first movie and all the crew stops in their tracks and watches proudly), I think the film's downfall is its narrative structure, which features three separate film professionals (Barry Sullivan, Turner and Powell) sitting in the office of a movie magnate and recollecting how producer Jonathan Shields (Douglas) came into and affected each of their lives. Does that sound familiar? It should if you have ever seen Citizen Kane, made 11 years earlier. Kane makes the device work by sending the faceless reporter from person to person to interview them. Here, all the narrators are gathered in one place under the auspices of being offered another chance to work with Shields and they each just vomit up their individual sagas as if it were a daily ritual. It's all so unfortunately contrived. You might argue that some of the devices of older films like this that seem awkward today need to be accepted and looked at within the historical context of the film &#150; an argument that I find myself making often. However, I don't think that's the case here. I think this was lazy storytelling then, just as it would be now.The performances offered some surprises as well. I have always been a big Gloria Grahame fan. Those eyes of hers and her presence just SCREAM sex to me. She is fun, sassy and great in films like Oklahoma, The Greatest Show on Earth and even It's a Wonderful Life. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work on this film, so I had high expectations for her as well. She doesn't appear until ¾ through the film and then she disappears quickly after that. Worst of all is that even during her brief screen time, she seems really off her game &#150; she's more a nuisance than anything else as Powell's Southern belle wife. The accent is fine, but she doesn't seem to offer any depth to the character whatsoever &#150; almost as if she were phoning it in. (This brings up another revisionist Oscar vote &#150; Best Supporting Actress of 1952 &#150; how in the world did Grahame beat Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in Singin' in the Rain? What do you guys think?) On the flip side, Kirk Douglas and Lana Turner, more well-known for being movie stars than actors (in the most esoteric sense of the word), deliver outstanding, layered and nuanced performances. With the exception of an unfortunate car scene (which I blame more on Minnelli), Turner avoids the histrionics that are normally associated with films like this (a trap she will fall into later in her career). She also manages to look stunningly gorgeous while at the same time, making her character's vulnerability very real and believable. Douglas is best when either playing smarmy confidence (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) or righteous indignation (Spartacus). Here, in a way, he gets to do both and as a result, he ignites the film whenever he is on-screen. It is easy to see why the three lost souls in the magnate's office were so drawn to him in the first place.In spite of these fine performances and also some additional good supporting work from Walter Pidgeon and Dick Powell, The Bad and the Beautiful is never able to overcome that initial hurdle of poor structure. Why couldn't the story be told chronologically? Would that have been so awful? And now that we're discussing it, what's the point of the story anyway? Shields gives each of them a chance to shine and then moves on (albeit sometimes in a not-so-ethical way). So what? Who cares? Where's the beef, as they say? Perhaps the episodic nature of the film diluted its potential impact, but even if the film were told sans flashbacks, I wonder if the film still wouldn't feel as empty as it does.

As the movie opens, a studio functionary (Walter Pigeon) summons three people whose dealings with Douglas were so traumatic that they flatly refuse ever to work with him again; it's Pigeon's job to persuade them otherwise.  The three are director Barry Sullivan; star Lana Turner; and writer Dick Powell.  Pigeon's tactic is to remind them that, without Douglas, they'd be nothing, and we revisit in turn their own associations with the producer.Douglas (who appears only in flashbacks) plays the son of an industry founder who has just died (he's first seen paying off professional mourners at the funeral).  Penniless, he teams up with Sullivan and talks Pigeon into giving him a job.  Soon, the team is churning out Poverty-Row programmers that `end with a kiss and black ink on the books' (and, though anachronistic, there are strong parallels to Val Lewton's work in the B-movie unit at RKO).  Their way of turning a profit while cutting corners makes them an unbeatable team &#150; until Douglas assigns Sullivan's pet screenplay to another director and steals his credit.Like Douglas, Turner's another second-generation misfit, daughter of a dead ham from the early talkies.  She's surviving on bit parts when she isn't off on a `bat,' which is regularly, but Douglas gives her a break, seeing star quality under her nervous amateurism (and Turner contributes some nice work here &#150; close to acting).  He weans her away from the bottle by offering himself as its replacement &#150; at least until her picture (some Mexican epic) is safely wrapped.... Powell, by contrast, is an outsider, a pipe-puffing academic whose historical novel hits the best-seller lists.  Against his better judgment, he's coaxed out to the coast.  When Douglas suspects Powell's writing is blocked because of his Southern belle wife (Gloria Grahame), he spirits him off to Lake Arrowhead for some uninterrupted work while pimping her off to Latin Lover Roland Gilbert, with dreadful consequences.  What's more, Douglas thinks he can take over direction of the movie himself, botching it and bankrupting his company.  Penniless once again, he needs the unhappy threesome to start over again....Though black and white, The Bad and the Beautiful displays the full MGM/Minnelli opulence &#150; a prestige release from the Tiffany studio.  And that can't help but to have declawed and defanged the material, some of which is still pretty rank under all the perfume sprayed around it.  Minnelli was a gifted showman who knew he worked best cosseted in the confines of the studio system, and he wasn't about to bite the hand that fed him so well &#150; or at least the bites were playful.  So the movie ends coyly, leaving it an open question whether the bad guy wasn't so bad after all.

I'm not so sure I buy it.  For me, this film is a much broader study of the ways in which producers of Hollywood's classic era (like the one played by Douglas) were, to put it in the most polite terms, very _involved_ in the creative process (the not so nice word might be _meddlesome_).  The three characters who provide the stories that are the film's flashbacks obviously represent the Director, the Star, and the Writer(who, as we all know is the lowest on the totem pole).As written, the character of Shields is a bit complex. No one can deny that he loves films and the film business, but what is his real motivation? After his father's death (another famous Hollywood man), he vows to ram the Shields name down the throats of his father's enemies and detractors.  One senses that, if you will pardon the cliche, the apple does not fall far from the tree.  He is not _evil_ in the way we see Burt Lancaster in The Sweet Smell of Success.  He does provide his friends with the opportunity for success, but oh what a price they pay.

But moral judgements are not entirely clear, because the producer's actions are motivated by his love of film and he always manages to give something even as he is taking what he needs. Unfortunately, an interesting story and outstanding performance by Kirk Douglas in the lead role are largely wasted by a mishandled attempt to structure the movie in a film-noir style.The telling of the story is based around a highly contrived setting which gives 3 characters a chance to narrate flashbacks. The first one is very well done, but unfortunately the quick cut back to the original setting reinforces just how highly contrived it was in the first place. Having to leave that first story is quite a disappointment. Neither of the next two flashbacks are strong enough to overcome that disappointment or to generate any continuity with the first. The second is mostly soap opera melodrama and the last one is made up of caricatures, not characters.To make matters worse, the interesting ambiguity as noted above is not played out within the stories but instead thrown in your face with no subtlety whatsoever in the final return to the contrived setting. That and a cutesy ending which has no place in the film completely uses up whatever potential the movie might have once had.

Many critics say the film is a captivating and realistic look at what goes on behind-the-scenes in Hollywood.When I read comments like these and heard it had a cast that includedKirk Douglas,Lana Turner,Walter Pidgeon,Dick Powell,and Gloria Grahame,I decided to watch it when it came on TCM(Turner Classic Movies)three months ago.The film tells the story of a studio executive(Pidgeon)of Sheilds Pictures,trying to convince three celebritiesan actress(Turner),a director(Barry Sullivan),and a playwright(Powell),to do a film with a greedy producer(Douglas),whom they all greatly despise.To show the audience why they hate this producer,there are three flashbacks.The film starts out very promising,but then just goes into pure boredom.The plot,itself,is fascinating,and if the film would have been done differently,it could've have been great.The flashbacks are extremely slow-moving,and you don't see the terrible things Kirk Douglas does until the very end of each of them.There isn't much detail about them,either. Because the script doesn't have much depth to it,the performers can't breathe life into story. I'll never understand how Gloria Grahame won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing Dick Powell's cheap,Southern wife. She's only in the film for ten minutes,if that long,and doesn't bring a real impact to the story.You also don't see her flirting with men,there is only talk of it.I can't believe Vincent Minelli,the brilliant director of Meet Me in St. Louis,Undercurrent,and Lust for Life,could direct this misfire.

Obviously this kind of behavior is excusable and even admired so long as success is achieved. Why is that attitude so easy to believe about Hollywood?)And why does a suit look so inappropriate on the ham Douglas? Lana is awful as usual and Gloria Grahams considerable talent is buried beneath a dreadful Southern accent.Even the excellent Dick Powell is unable to salvage this homage to Hollywood silliness. But be of good faith; the victims of the mogul's scandalous antics finally realize,in fact,that he has done each of them an incalculable favor and that the success they later achieve on their own merits was possible only because of him. The ungrateful victims join our hero in a very typical and schmaltzy happy ending. The viewer now understands how terrible,selfish behavior is really an act of kindness. Only in LalaLand.

With Kirk Douglas representing Welles, and Walter Pidgeon representing Herman Mankiewicz. After all, the script contains references to something like the boy genius (or perhaps the young genius - it goes by very fast, but it's in the section where the Douglas and Pidgeon characters are working on getting the Gaucho to star in their movie), and the Shields touch (cf. the Welles touch) in regard to the main character's skill at directing. And, Douglas' character steals a script credit from Pidgeon's character, although this was not uncommon in Hollywood in those years.

She appears to be the flared nostril blonde recruited by Mr. Douglas and Mr. Pidgeon for their night on the town with the Latin Lover whom they hope to cast in their film version of The Fountainhead or whatever it's supposed to be.  Imagine my surprise to find she is not listed in even the uncredited credits.  Surely I am quite mistaken.As for Vincent Minelli, the great Radio City Music Hall costume designer, I love the warm friendly feeling I get from his films.  Some Came Running is probably the most outrageous example of people getting together to have a good time.  The bar scene with Shirley MacLaine is bizarre. He also provided a safe haven for Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien to be as cute, beautiful, charming and bizarre as they could ever be in Meet Me in St. Louis.  Scenes from The Band Wagon and Ziegfield's Follies (that Limehouse Blues segment!) are among my favorites.

It's interesting to watch as a kind of classical Hollywood cliche; however, the outlandish performances turned in by Kirk Douglas and Lana Turner don't really work for a modern audience.  Much of the movie comes off as ridiculous, and it quite frequently becomes difficult to stifle laughter during some scenes that were not meant to be funny.The movie, when viewed in the context of the period during which it was made, is an entertaining foray into the film industry, but it does little to dismiss the popular opinion that people that make movies about Hollywood are simply not creative enough to come up with ideas that aren't completely based on their own lives. As a result, the story becomes tedious at times, and the characters are flat, though overall the movie is still pretty watchable.

This is a common trick, which I believe to be the most effective in all film, especially when disguised. But it all depends on the movie being well made. In this case, we have a collection of A-list personalities, none of whom do anything near competent work by today's standards, except for Minnelli's staging. The irony is in the story it is about a man who makes excellent films, terrific films, special films that bowl viewers over. This film does none of that. Our man Kirk is famously on record as thinking movies are only about storytelling and actors are only about inhabiting a character.Kirk's character new this wasn't all, at least the guy who wrote it knew. Art is destructive, creation is painful. People get hurt. In powerful movies, even viewers get hurt.This movie is like the ones Pigeon's character talks about.Lana made a career of being a damaged person who communicated that damage. Not the same as being a dimensional person who can communicate depth.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life. "}]
