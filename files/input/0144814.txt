She can actually act and looks sincere. The only problem is that she's far too good looking for the role. That may sound shallow, but throughout the movie, we're supposed to get the impression that she's ugly and because of that, she's an outcast. Contrast this to Sissy Spacek in the original who looked plain enough to carry out the role of ugly duckling. It was only her talent that let Bergl carry (pun not intended) out the role convincingly.The antoganists are unusually shallow, especially when presented against the more modern bad guys in horror films, at least where you can see the bad guy. Though at least one of the bad girls is convincing as Rachel's new friend.Jason Landon does an amiable job as Rachel's boyfriend and lends a lot of credibility to the final scene which, I must say, is a refreshing change from the hand coming out of the ground scenes popularized by the original Carrie.All in all, a refreshingly entertaining and, dare I say, well done show.

Moreover the set decoration was very clever and added a deeper understanding of the characters. Bonus points for having Danny B. Harvey and Billie Holiday music in it!

Although the first Carrie is a classic cult horror movie and can never be topped, The Rage did a good job living up to the standards set by the first.  Newcomer Emily Bergl did an excellent job as the enraged Rachel.  Amy Irving returns as Sue Snell, and this allows the The Rage to be connected to Carrie.  A series of flashbacks and many connections to the first Carrie, help The Rage succeed.  Everything is well explained and you leave the theatre very satisfied.  There is some gore and scary parts that may not be suitable for younger viewers that have watched the first (and much tamer) Carrie.

For starters, it stayed true to the idea of having actors who are in their 20s playing teenagers (that was a joke) because Sizzy Spacek was 26 when she played Carrie in the original and we've got a 24 year old playing Rachel Long in this film here as well as a few 27 year old people playing some of the jocks.I just loved seeing those jocks and back-stabbers getting what they deserved. They acted so well to get you to hate them. You could feel Rachel's pain and the evil within her and what she was doing... although it was so brutal and Satan-like... it was something you could somewhat cheer for. It's an amazing scene with all the glass shattering. Incredible!But never mind that - the acting is very good in this film. The storyline is a little bit thin at times but on top of all of that it still is rather original. Some good special effects, some pretty good comedy from that American Pie nerd guy (you know who I am talking about) and it's a lot better than most modern day teen horror schlock! I put this film alongside Freddy vs. Jason as one of the most surprisingly good teen horror films of the last decade. All those Halloween sequels, and Scream if you know what I did last summer crap as well as those films that try to take the mickey out of teen horror films are worthy of more than enough Razzies when compared to this film. I'm so glad this film wasn't nominated for Razzies.I can't believe Emily Bergl is 30 now!

Only this is a reason to call this a good movie - because I think that Stephen King fans had to see much bad adaptions of the master´s work in the past. Another reason is that this movie is much better than all the other teen-horror-movies of the last years like I Know What You Did Last Summer (of course I could never say something bad about the first two Scream movies - seriously!). Carrie 2 handles teenager´s problems and conflict much better than other films and I think that it is a much better film to identificate with for young people. The new Carrie is - once again - a true outsider and not one of these upper class all-american teens like the ones in I Know...etc. The movie shows its sympathy for this outsider (a nice detail in some scenes you can see the Marilyn Manson-poster at the wall of Rachel´s room - the icon of all angry outsiders).

Emily Bergl and Jason London star as Rachel Lang and Jesse Ryan, respectively. Making her cameo/return from the first film is Amy Irving in the role of Sue Snell, the sole survivor of the original massacre. Amy Irving, while not seen very often in the film, does a fantastic job of showing that the character is indeed still very tormented by that fateful night (it all just comes flooding back to her when Rachel breaks the snow globe).One of the best scenes in the movie is when Sue Snell takes Rachel (very distraught over the suicide of her best friend) back to the location of the original massacre, where the remnants of the desecrated high school still stand. It is also this scene that tells us how Rachel got her powers - she's Carrie's half-sister by way of a shared father.That brings us back to Rachel and Jesse. These two become attracted to one another as the film progresses and eventually go out on a couple of dates. Let me just say something here. The romance between these two was done amazingly well, aided by the on-screen chemistry between Bergl and London. I was so taken by it all that I actually hurt for Jesse when Rachel died.In the end, they end up getting a little too close for the comfort (and over-inflated ego) of Jesse's ex-girlfriend, who subsequently plots revenge with her friends, as well as the other football players that Jesse rightfully dissed earlier in the film, completely unaware of the grizzly fate that awaits them all. It all goes down at the post game party at the rich football player, Mark's house. Inevitably, they go too far and end up pushing Rachel off the deep end...and into a seething ocean of rage. The party-goers all die in particularly gory fashion - to include a girl being riddled with CDs and a jock being pinned to a door (and Ms. Snell) by a fireplace poker. The jock, Eric (played by Zachary Ty Brian) - also the guy responsible for the death of Rachel's best friend - certainly gets it worse then anyone when he is castrated with a harpoon gun.In the end, mirroring the first film, Rachel exacts her revenge and kills herself in the process, leaving a very heartbroken Jesse the sole survivor.This was such a great movie for so many reasons, and I truly recommend it to any fan of the horror genre.

An outsider is humiliated and abused for the first two acts and a small portion of the third. Then the tables are turned. The victim becomes the ultimate abuser, sending jocks and sorority girls and random teens to an untimely grave.This is the price a writer and director pay for working in this particular genre. The final rampage isn't really a surprise it's what people bought their tickets for.What is a surprise in CARRIE 2 is how well made it is. Surprise, surprise. It's not made in Canada or Romania or New Zealand. It's actually made in America, in North and South Carolina.And what good actors. Jason London, 27 years old, still in high school all these years after DAZED AND CONFUSED which should have made him a major star but for some reason didn't. Rachel Blanchard, who's been acting since she was six, as the bad girl who pretends to befriend the leading lady. Mena Suvari before American BEAUTY.The casting is good all around. These high school students actually look like they go to high school.Here's an idea for the ultimate revenge of the teen underdog movie. The first act would be a shortened remake of THE BREAKFAST CLUB. Detention served, they would walk out the door of the school only to discover that some scourge has destroyed all other human life on the planet.

However, I got my money's worth by far!What worked the most for me in the this movie was the degree of sincerity and intelligence portrayed in the script.  This wasn't a typical blood 'n guts gore film about some girl who gets her feelings hurt and knocks off the entire student body.  There's much more beneath the surface than that.I would dearly love to see this movie again while it's still playing on the big screen.  There's something different about this movie which is a cut above many of the recent teen-scream movies which have come out over the past 2 years.  I'm not sure what it is.   It might be truer-to-life characterisations, or terrific performance by newcomer Emily Bergl, or the well-written story which unfolds at the perfect pace, and sets you up for the (somewhat) typical finale.  I think it's most likely the empathy you feel for Rachel, and the sadness which prevails.  And where true love is concerned, like Romeo & Juliet, true lovers can only be together forever in death.  That is the definitive nature of happy endings, as illustrated early on in this film.This movie - however - does not end this way.The Rage is rated R for mild language, brief sexuality, and - naturally - horror violence and gore.  Although there isn't that much throughout the movie, you get your fill at the end.  There's not much of that creative blood-letting many horror films delve into, which is a refreshing change.

Hence, The Rage is essentially a more-modern remake as much as a sequel. In fact, it's not even necessary to see the original to appreciate it.THE PLOT A social outcast in high school slowly becomes aware that she has telekinetic abilities. These powers are unleashed with lethal fury when the popular kids pull a meanspirited prank on her.WHAT WORKS I'm glad The Rage doesn't have the creepy Pharisaical mother like in the original. This is one aspect that I couldn't stand about Carrie. It (sort of) gave the impression that anyone who takes the teachings of Christianity seriously will become a warped, hideous, deathly, abusive killjoy like Carrie's mother. Actually, although there are indeed modern-day Pharisees in Christendom, nothing could be further from the truth. Authentic Christianity gives liberty, life and joy, not the opposite (see, for example, John 831-32, John 1010 and 1 Peter 18). Don't take me wrong here, I'm not preachin' to you.Emily Bergl plays Carrie's half-sister Rachel and she does it well. She's an outcast like Carrie but she's stronger, more confident and doesn't have a dream to fit in with the popular kids. One of the film's themes is Does love really exist? Rachel says she doesn't believe in love. Her mother's in a mental institution. She's a foster child and her foster parents clearly only have her for the extra money, not because they love her.Any teenager or adult can readily relate to the situations/issues addressed in the film- The common cliques the popular crowd, oversexed jocks, snooty cheerleaders, rich kids and their parents, nerds, outcasts, etc. - Pre-mature sexual experience and the resulting emotional turmoil. - Suicide. - the spiritual emptiness of casual sex. - First love, true love. - Being attracted to or dating someone outside your social stratum. - Football, players, fandom and hardcore coaching antics. - Friendship, rivalry, fights. - Partying.The Rage effectively brings to life these joys and horrors of the high school experience.Jesse, played by Jason London is an interesting character. Jesse is truly attracted to Rachel, but why? It's not that she's conventionally beautiful like his ex-girlfriend, although she's not ugly either. Perhaps Jesse sees the superficiality and conformity of the spoiled popular kids clique and veers toward someone more humble, loving and genuine, like Rachel. Also observe that Jesse isn't a conformist, even though he's technically part of the popular kids clique Because of his love for an outcast he fearlessly stands up to the most popular (arrogant) jock; everyone on the team gets his head shaved except Jesse, etc.It's interesting to note that, although Rachel is portrayed as a misfit who likes Marilyn Manson, she's not a rebellious, disrespectful teenager. She never answers back her foster 'father,' she works, she isn't promiscuous and isn't a party monger.Furthermore, The Rage is respectful of its source. It even brings back the lone survivor of the original, Sue Snell (Amy Irving), as a school counselor.Also, the credits features the excellent song Crazy Little Voices by the Egyptian band Ra, which isn't available on their proper albums.WHAT DOESN'T WORK There's a love scene that's premature IMHO, but it can be defended on the grounds that time has to be condensed in a movie.I just saw the original Carrie and The Rage back-to-back and I liked the latter better with the exception of the original's prom scene, which is iconic with the blood-splattered Sissy and the fire in the background. Plus, the '76 version is the original version and it gets points just for that whereas Carrie 2 loses points for just being another take on the same basic plot. I suppose you could also argue that the original has better mood, which it does.Yet I prefer the sequel because Rachel is a much more interesting character than Carrie in the original film and Jesse is really attracted to Rachel -- even loves her -- rather than Tommy just doing his girlfriend a favor and feeling sorry for Carrie in the original.Also, the thin plot of the original is clearly padded -- unimportant scenes are drawn-out to about twice the length they need to be -- and this makes the movie seem long at 98 minutes and some parts boring. The Rage, by contrast, runs 104 minutes but it doesn't seem as long (or boring) as the original because the story and characters are more interesting and the film isn't padded. FINAL ANALYSIS I encourage you to be openminded and allow yourself to enjoy a different take on the same basic plot of Carrie. Both films have their strengths. In some ways The Rage is better than Carrie. It's definitely not a weak or campy sequel; rather it's a strong late-90s updating and effectively showcases the joys and horrors of the high school years.The film was shot in Dallas & Charlotte, NC, and runs 104 minutes.GRADE A "},{"Title":"Carrie White's Legacy Continues!!!","Date":"18 January 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" After the 2013 Carrie remake was released, I wanted to re-watch the original and its sequel.

Why we should care about any of this is revealed by school guidance counselor Sue Snell (a jittery Amy Irving reprising her role from the original, and collecting a quick payday to boot), who discovers that Rachel is...wait for it...the 'half- sister' of Carrie White. Yep, a blood relative of the girl who telekinetically whipped up the infamous Prom Night Massacre at the old, burned-site of Bates High School's original campus. Which, if you remember, left poor Sue as the sole survivor of the fried student body.

I came across The Rage Carrie 2 on the shelf, looking for something to take me back to the late '90s nostalgia I've been feeling lately. Hey, anything is better than this decade we're living in, right? I popped The Rage Carrie 2 in, and watched it for the second time ever. I've had this movie almost 2 years, and I've only watched it twice. I guess second chances are good, because this time around, I don't know what it was, this movie touched me. Maybe it's because I have a girlfriend whom I really love, I dunno. Anyway, the performances were excellent. Emily Bergl really did a great job of playing Rachel; she really made me sympathetic and empathize with Rachel. The part where Rachel begs and pleads with God to take her life because she has been so humiliated and is finally at the end of her rope emotionally, really broke my heart. Any movie that can bring me to tears earns points in my book. Jason London takes on a different role from the one he had in Dazed and Confused, although he still manages to be on the football team. I was really hoping for him to save Rachel in the end, but of course we all were, I'm sure. The other cast members of this film, including Amy Irving (why did she have to die so horribly!!??, I guess keeping up with the tradition of the one sympathetic adult getting killed in a gruesome and violent way, kind of like Miss Collins in Carrie). I really hated the other jocks, so therefore the performers who were portraying them did their jobs well, as did the other popular people. Eddie Kaye Thomas was kind of off in left field, but I guess so was his character. The shatter effect really got me to jump. So, a shout out to Katt Shea for directing this film.

Carrie White was victim epitomized, and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel.Whoever conceived the Rachel character for The Rage must have completely missed the subtleties of Carrie. For the audience to genuinely share the victim's rage, s/he must be a sympathetic character-- a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of his/her own vices. Rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of Sissy Spacek's Carrie. And she looks and acts like she should be right along-side the 'attractive and popular brigade' that she ends up torching. She, like the rest of them, has a soul that is every bit as corrupt, whereas Carrie was a complete innocent.It just doesn't work. There's no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children-- not even the Home Improvement boy-- getting offed in this movie's climactic scene. And it's so unnecessarily gory! There was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym! And there is one person in particular that this movie should NOT have had the audacity to kill off... but I won't say who it is. If you've seen the original Carrie, it's the sort of character who dies unjustly.At least they DID create the connection to Carrie appropriately; it's explained as it should have been. But that, and the arm tattoo, which was done rather nicely, is just about the only thing this movie has going for it.Yet another hideous Scream knock-off, and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. Rating 1 out of 10. I wasn't expecting much, but I was still horribly disappointed. An unsympathetic character, a series of irritating pop-culture references thrown in for no good reason, and an ending scene that pales in comparison to Carrie's gravestone shocker.

The original Carrie, if anything I've read is accurate, wasn't met with instant critical success. But due to DePalma's growing reputation and developing career, it has taken on a cult status for sure. And for good reason.I made sure to watch the original before viewing the sequel. The original has a lot going for it, most notably in the style and thematic department. However, I believe it lacks to some degree in character development, and the sequel actually succeeds at creating more believably motivated characters than the original.For instance, William Katt's character in the original, Tommy Ross, sporting the Sammy Hagar-esquire mop, is a very ambiguous character. The top jock who is also a straight-A student and with a popular girl, he doesn't get to do much for the film except show a nice smile. He gets enlisted by his girlfriend Sue Snell (Amy Irving) to take wallflower Carrie to the prom in order to make up for the vicious hazing in the opening shower scene. Tommy agrees, the administration finds out and thinks it's another joke, but the couple do it anyway. It's never really clear through the script and character development just how much they really care about making it up to Carrie. It's a gaping hole that could have been simply filled with some more dialogue or additional scenes of Snell's character. Then, instead of offering resolution for Katt's character, he gets clonked on the head with a bucket and presumably dies on the prom couple stage. Huh? The Rage, on the other hand, features a heroine who is less a victim than a tough survivor. No wallflower is she, like the pathetic Carrie of the original. No insane religious overtones here, except for the opening. Rachel, played with a very believable control by cutey Emily Bergl, is not beautiful or even stunningly cute like Sissy Spacek was. The key to the original, in my mind, are those amazing eyes of Spacek's filmed in the red lens as she's covered with blood, during those split-screen, slo-mo shots of the revenege and the rampage. That trance-like state during the murder sequence is CREEPY.The Rage features one heck of a revenge ending as well. Don't underestimate. People get it, but good.The effects are better than the original, they're graphic, and they're appropriate. Talk about CD killing--this is better than Hellraiser III's CD slicing. And one of the jocks gets a comeuppance involving a spear gun that's...well, appropriate, especially since he's played by the believably dimwitted Brad from TV's Home Improvement. (Bit disappointed about the head jock's demise...though it was stylistically impressive, I must say.) Which brings me to the acting and the chemistry with these characters. First off, they look more like high school kids than the original film portrayed. They act like it, too. Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, PJ Soles--they looked old in 1976, and the latter looked old in Halloween playing a cheerleader another 2 years later.Another treat--we get a returning cast member. Always a BIG plus in my book when someone agrees to come back. This time it's Sue Snell (Irving), now a guidance counselor at the rebuilt high school. She has her own checkered past, including commitment to an asylum following the events of the original. I was quite surprised by her fate in this film, that's for sure. Gutsy.Perhaps one of the biggest notes on this film is the fact that, being a 90s horror remake, which everyone thinks will just be an excuse for wall-to-wall violence, or in this case, telekinesis non-stop, it's not. Save for the very bloody end (appropriate--this is a revenge film, remember) the telekinetic power portion of the film is handled very well and controlled in terms of Rachel's acceptance. In the original, the wallflower came out so quickly and was suddenly throwing her mother to the bed.I don't know. I think this film got an automatic panning or a lackluster reaction for no good reason. In its own right, it works well. It's more about what's going on in American high schools everywhere today than it is about telekinetic powers, etc. (Though we get more info on it than the original).So let's not be so quick to scoff at a film that's a sequel to a DePalma. Take this for what it is a good modern revenge film about the timeless cruelty of kids and the curveball of telekinetic powers. I think director Katt Shea (who once was retrospected at MOMA) put more into this than most people think.Another point of recommendation--extras. 3 extra scenes are here which are interesting, as well as the original ending, which thank God they didn't use. The more subtle and shocking effect of the last scene is chilling and fits perfectly.

She takes interest in student Rachel Lang (Emily Bergl). Rachel is, much like Carrie, a tormented teenager. Her mother is in a mental hospital, she lives with an abusive step-father, she's picked on at school and her best friend Lisa (Mena Suvari) has just killed herself. Falling in love with Jesse (Jason London), a nice jock, brings her even more trouble and his teammates target her when she discovers their link to Lisa's suicide. As Sue discovers the chilling link between Rachel and Carrie, mean-spirited teenagers plan a cruel prank against Rachel that will unleash her secret powers of telekinesis.my thoughts I think this a very well done sequel that deserves more credit than it gets. It is certainly not as good as the original, but it is still a good continuation of the original.Amy Irving returning as Sue was good to me because I loved seeing what happened to her after all she's been through in the original. When we left her, she was haunted by nightmares of the prom incident and to this day, 20 years later, she is still haunted by memories and feels guilty. So she tries to find redemption in helping Rachel, who is stronger than Carrie was because she doesn't want anyone to help her.I also loved Emily Bergl as Rachel because she was a very different character than Carrie. Sure, she is picked on at school, she has a psycho religious mother and she has telekinesis. But her story is so much different. She actually has friends, her mother does not want to hurt her and when she moves things with her mind, she doesn't accept this and just thinks she's going crazy like her mother did. Also, her romance with Jesse is a lot more focused on than the relationship between Carrie and Tommy.The rest of the cast also does fine. Dylan Bruno, Zachery Ty Bryan, Rachel Blanchard, Charlotte Ayanna, Justin Urich, and Elijah Craig all play one-dimensional mean kids but who cares, they had awesome deaths. J. Smith-Cameron is very different from Piper Laurie as the psycho religious nut, while Margaret used her religion as a weapon against Carrie, Barbara used her religion as a shield keeping outside forces from corrupting Rachel. I also enjoyed Mena Suvari as Rachel's friend, Eddie Kaye Thomas as the comic relief nerd and Clint Jordan as the sheriff who may or may not be a survivor of Carrie's massacre.Katt Shea is a great director. I love her work in POISON IVY (also about an emotionally abused teenage girl who turns into a murderer) and I love her work here. I especially loved how when Rachel's powers are used, the film switches from color to black and white. She also did good with the flashbacks to the original Carrie.The party climax is like the club scene in HELLRAISER III, very gory and fun to watch. Gore hounds will totally love it.So, even though this isn't as good as the original, it's still a nice drama/horror sequel.

The cover looked soooo shocking and neat that I couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed looking at it in amazement.  When I read the back cover, the story enthralled me to death.  I desperately wanted to rent it. The story was soooo different than any other scary film that I just had to see it.  I was too much of a chicken to rent it until I was in 8th grade. I had convinced my friends about the story and they wanted to rent it too. Finally we did.  I was scared to death from the very beginning!  When the blood came down on Carrie, I wanted to press eject.  I was that terrified. In amazement, I'd knew I'd never forget that  amazing story and it completely scared me.  There was a time when I saw a few minutes of it but still I was too scared.  Finally in 1999, I somehow heard that there would be a sequel.  I don't remember where, but I heard about it.  I had always been wondering and dreaming that there would be one and what it would be like.  Now I wanted to learn everything there was about it from that moment. I knew it was coming out and closer and closer, websites kept putting Carrie, Say You're Sorry as the title.  I agreed that that would have been an awful title, drawing virtually nobody.  I saw She's All That with a friend of mine and I had hoped that I would see a preview, but there was none.  After the movie, we stood around in the lobby waiting to see if we felt like talking to this kid we knew from school.  Not knowing whether we wanted to or not, I was looking at the posters for Coming Attractions.  On it, I saw a plain poster with a evil-looking girl.  When I almost turned my head, I saw a familiar pattern.  The title said The Rage Carrie 2 and I almost filpped out!  I said I wanted to see that right away and that I couldn't believe that there would be a sequel! From that point on, I knew what to look up on webpages.  I kept typing in Carrie 2 and nothing would come up.  Finally, I saw the official website but was not all that impressed.  It didn't have all that much.  After I had seen when the date it would be released, I waited and waited.  I NEVER once saw a preview!!!  I wish they put more and more trailers on tv and in the movies shown at theaters!!!  I bet if it was, there would be lots more people and more money being made!  Finally I was busy on March 12, and on March 13, I saw it.  It was about 745 or so and at the very very popular theater I saw it at, there weren't many in there!  We sat next to an older couple!  There weren't many teens in there either!  I was a little (actually a whole lot) bored during the movie.  It built up great, but I guess I wasn't in the mood to watch a movie.  The ending scared me, but it wasn't as shocking as Carrie.  My friend didn't care for it all that much, and neither did I. BUT later that week and ever since it was released on video, I HAD to see it again!  Something stuck with me and I needed to see it once more! Although I hated the gore, suicide, and dog part (you'll see if you see it) I just had this major urge to see it once more!  Finally I did.  It was gross, but great!  If only they took out those parts, I would love it even more!  I bought the video!  I was not all that disappointed, but great when compared to the first.BOTTOM LINE  SEE IT, RENT IT, BUY IT, VOTE AND GIVE IT A 10!  I HOPE THERE IS A FINAL THIRD SEQUEL!  THERE NEEDS TO BE!

Emily Bergl is absolutely fantastic as telekinetic Rachel, and Jason London is excellent as her love interest.

Anything is possible. The Rage Carrie 2 was mostly the weirdest thing I've ever saw. Knowing what Carrie started and Rachel left off. It was fair enough to see one of the survivors of Carrie's wrath working at the new high school. And a new outcast Rachel(Emily Bergl) whose friend commits suicide at the school. This character didn't quite fit in with her foster family. Because her mother is a nutshell. And the jocks were the real heels of the movie. The plot kinda mirrors the first movie, but unlike the first Carrie with Sissy Spacek, Emily Bergl's Rachel was meaner looking. And there was no blood spatter in this one. Although RACHEL'S WRATH was much MUCH worse than Carrie's. Her tattoo comes alive, her powers is unleashed and everyone is in deep trouble, including the last survivor of the first movie. She really defined the term pokerface. CDs and flying glass were effective on everyone who crossed and deceived her. Rachel was indeed deadlier than Carrie. But one question left me to wonder, did she perish? Only time will tell. This movie was weird compared to the first, and I out of all people would think twice on making her mad!

Why do some people have to go around trashing a sequel most of the time just because it isn't consistent with the original ? So what if it doesn't quite follow in detail the book to the letter ? You have to understand it's a MOVIE not a book and in a movie the director may alter a few aspects while at the same time being careful not to drift away from the story for sake of creativity. Sure the first Carrie was good, not as gory as the sequel but it has its place in the top notch films, only this one is better and not necessarily because it has more gore in it, though that should count as credit, for after all the story of Carrie is about gore but mainly because not only it follows the plot but adds a few ingredients like Carrie's half sister, Rachel, who helps continuing the story where Mr De Palma left off. I suppose the only true opinion we could get about a movie is to ask the author of the book what he thinks of it in this case, Stephen King himself. Yeah Mr Stephen King what is your opinion of the first Carrie movie and the sequel regarding your novel, Carrie ? Unfortunately, slim chances of finding out, i know, but it would've meant something even if just for curiosity's sake. Of course we don't have to agree with it if his opinion were to be known to us for everyone has different tastes, but when you put someone's work down just because you didn't like it it's not the best approach especially if a lot of clues can be seen in the movie regarding the fact that the crew tried their best -which is not the same i could say for the Bloodrayne movies- but that's another story. Getting back to The Rage - Carrie 2 i found the movie to be quite satisfyingly entertaining in terms of love and revenge..nice mix by the way and i will elaborate on both. The love is an interesting add-on that we don't see in the first Carrie - Carrie wasn't loved at all except in her mother's twisted, fanatic and deranged way. Carrie having a boyfriend? Come on, that WOULD be a first, but here in the sequel, we see love building in the chemistry developing between Rachel and Jesse and that's something we can relate to or have related to at some point in our lives undoubtedly. These are new ingredients brought to the story, emphasizing the originality of this sequel, ingredients not found anywhere in the first Carrie movie. These add-ons help the story progress for they revolve around the main characters Jesse and Rachel throughout the entire film in a subtle manner which is even more captivating, at least for me. So, anyway, people, please bare in mind that just because it's a sequel it doesn't necessarily have to be bad, and it isn't. You just have to look beyond certain aspects to understand this and this movie certainly provides them, sometimes not on a silver platter but they're there. And one last thing, it makes perfect sense to name this movie The Rage Carrie 2 since Rachel was Carrie's half sister another genuine idea that brought continuity to the story. And the soundtrack..well... Mr Harvey did a fine work on that one and Ra as well for writing crazy little voices exclusively for this movie..that song rocked, man. This film might not deserve a 10/10, but at least an 8, it deserves even if just for the sake of creativity. Still, i give it a 10/10. And whoever doesn't think my vote is fair, that's just too bad. Outstanding movie! Peace all !

In fact, this problem is not only between school kids, but also between grown ups in society. What's wrong with our society?

The movie is about an outcast girl named Rachel. She was taken away from her mother after she went mad one night when Rachel was young, and now as a teenager, Rachel seems disconnected from the rest of her peers. Rachel's one good friend, Lisa, commits suicide at their school after finding out she was part of a game when she lost her virginity to one of the over-sexed high school jocks. The jocks score girls on a scale and have made their own little game out of it. Rachel's life begins to spin out of control, as she discovers she has telekinetic powers, is dealing with the death of her friend, and while she is being pursued by a good-hearted football player. But all hell breaks loose when the group of jocks play a prank on Rachel at a house party, causing one big bloody disaster.This movie was unneeded, but managed to be a pretty good movie. Amy Irving returns as Sue Snell (who was in the original film), this time playing a school counselor who tries to help Rachel after her friend's suicide. The entire film is basically the original movie rehashed in more modern times, but it has enough spins on it to keep you interested. The acting was okay, and the blood bath finale where Rachel's powers go wild was pretty well-done.If you enjoyed the original film, you may or may not like this one, but I think it was pretty well done overall. I'm not sure what convinced them to do a sequel, but it could have been much worse. 6/10.

This movie was cool and I disagree with NickL-3 about not killing the so called innocents. When somebody goes thru hell and has nobody on their side, it doesn't matter. If somebody is humiliated beyond their tolerance, there are no rationalizations. Nobody in the vicinity remains an innocent. If you stand by and watch someone being harassed without coming to their aid, then you end up as a part of the oppressors, a passive one. Only people who are absolutely raging will do such a thing and that is what this movie has tried to depict. Rachel is a troubled teen, not to say, forever taunted and ostracized. As she discovers her extraordinary powers, she hasn't discovered how to control them. To top that, everybody around her is scheming to humiliate her. She loses control and WHAM! Everything is over. If we don't want to be among the innocent dead, I suggest scramming as soon as we sense trouble... If I can't assist someone who is in trouble, I won't stand there and watch the oppression either, I'd call the cops or try to get hold of somebody who can help the person in trouble, or at least put the oppressors in their place.

Other parts, however, lead me to believe that the plot was entirely thought out, and neither were the characters. Technically the same plot as the original, the few differences aren't very successful.Rachel (Emily Bergl) takes over the Sissy Spacek role in this 1999 version, of the cult classic Carrie. While I admit that Bergl does a fine job with the material she is given, her performance could never live up to that of Spacek. Many elements of the character were lost, and you don't have as much sympathy. The Rachel character isn't shy, quiet, and meek like Carrie. She actually seems to be pretty well adjusted for a teenager. She reminds me of me, and her becoming a mass murderer just doesn't have the same effect.Another thing that bothers me about this production is how the writers make Rachel change herself for a guy. It annoyed me that on a date with Jesse, Rachel wears a lavender dress. I can buy the fact that she puts on makeup and tries to look prettier, but why, after an entire movie of wearing dark colors, do they have her switch to lavender? It could be some metaphorical thing about how her life is brightening, but I just see it as a character flaw.The traditional boy role in this movie, previously played by the handsome William Katt, is taken over by Jason London. While I admit, I think Jason London is pretty attractive, the way his character is written just doesn't appeal to me as much as the Tommy Ross character.There were some things I liked about this movie. The set-up with Lisa (Mena Suvari) added to the film, but as a previous reviewer said, just this incident, the sex ring and Rachel's reaction would have made for a great film. I enjoyed the end scene, with Jesse in his dorm, and I enjoyed the reappearance of Sue Snell (the fabulous Amy Irving), although her character seems a little half-brained.6/10 "},{"Title":"A decent sequel, though I haven't watched the original all the way through to compare the 2 movies.","Date":"6 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  (WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, SO PLEASE READ AT YOUR RISK.)THE RAGE CARRIE 2(1999)Developed and published by Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer/United Artists>>Pros A decent horror/drama movie for teens; people who like the theme of vengeance will like this movie>>Cons Over-the-top sterotypical and annoying teens; plot connection to the original is weak; the protagonist is not weak and extremely tormented like Carrie was in the original; the TV commercials pretty much gave away the movie; the sequel basically just copies the original film>>Plot summary Rachel Lang(Emily Bergl) is a teenage girl who had lost her mother as a little girl because of her mother's insanity of the Devil being in her baby.

As a former teen who got picked on a lot in high school by my fellow peers and a person who likes stories that deal with revenge, I knew I had to check this movie out.  The TV commercials pretty much gave away the whole movie, but I decided to go see the movie anyway.  Except for Emily Bergl, the acting was pretty corny and not believable for a split second.  The people in the gang of the cool kids were complete b**tards and b****es; you're supposed to hate them right away while sympathizing with Rachel all through the movie.  Unlike Carrie White, Rachel was a strong female who could hold her own against the evil army of no-good teens, which I thought was cool but took away from the movie's tone. Sue Snell was the only real connection to the original, but she's mostly annoying.  As for the violence, boy, are you in for the graphic depictions of vengeance!  I won't go into the details for sake of spoiling the movie, but it does get a whole lot uglier than the carnage inflicted by Carrie. However, I did like the bitter end to the evil teens that caused Rachel a lot of pain.My rating 6 out of 10My last 2 cents Fans of the original will most likely hate it, but this was made to appeal to teens and young adults of the new millenium who have never seen the first one anyway.

The fact that the whole story line takes place over one week, is way too little time for this movie to develop into anything.

I also want to mention that the acting of the social worker (Amy Irving) was awful.  I just kept wanting her to go away, and I always thought she was very over-dramatic.  I did like some of the special effects and the camera movements that the director used.  I did not see the original Carrie, so I do not know how the two movies compare, but I did think that this story line was very predictable, yet it had some suspenseful parts to it.  I also want to mention that the performance by Emily Bergl (Rachel) was very good.

In a few cases, a sequel didn't happen for generations. To this day, 'Return to Oz' holds the record for biggest length of time between an original film and it's sequel. Belated sequels are tricky however. More often than not they're just an attempt to cash in. 'Carrie' was a hit at the time of it's release and is a favorite of many to this day.

Moves at a steady pace. Does a decent job of updating the concept. Finale packs a wallop.Cons Not the least bit scary. Clumsy narrative. Some stereotypical characters.

There is homage paid to the original by having Amy Irving play a guidance counselor. However, other than the lead's telekinetic abilities, there are few links to the original.

The Rage, at least in my opinion, was an excellent, very very sad movie. I never saw the original Carrie, personally, because I think that it's a waste of time to read the book AND see the movie. Everyone is saying that it's slow. I watched it twice in one day. The FIRST time I watched it, it did NOT seem slow. I was definitely enthralled! But the second time, it did get kind of old and I fast forwarded it. At least, I did until it got to the end scenes. It was excellent! I think it was very, very, VERY good. I cried.

The acting is great, the direction not so much (but hey, Brian De Palma was by far worst!), the character construction is terrific and the final climax ultra-intense. What fails?

This starts a lifelong tradition of separation by her friends until High School, where she befriends like-minded Lisa Parker, (Mena Suvari). When Lisa kills herself at school, Rachel discovers that as she gets angrier, she has control over objects. A tragedy introduces her to Jesse Ryan, (Jason London) a popular football player at the high school. They become really close after a while, much to the despair of his friends Mark (Dylan Bruno) and Eric, (Zachery Ty Bryan). When Eric discovers that Rachel knows what he did to Lisa, he and Mark decide to make her forget about telling anyone else. When Jesse comes to her rescue, she falls for him and the two become more than friends. The school psychiatrist, Sue, (Amy Irving) discovers that Rachel has telekinesis and that Mark and Jesse have a big falling out as friends. When they reform their friendship, Mark has the intention of humiliating Rachel in front of everyone. When she shows up with Jesse, he breaks with his promise and humiliates her, making her turn against Jesse and everyone at the party.The Good News What I really enjoyed was how the film isn't really connected to the first one other than the character of Sue. It takes pretty much the exact same storyline and adds some contemporary sub-plots that actually move the story along rather than make it confusing and hard to figure out. While none really went anywhere special, they both allow the film to set up a problem or two that will result in Rachel's humiliation. The reasons that she has to seek vengeance are very realistic reason, which could've killed the movie if she didn't have a good reason or two. Wanting to get back at people who have broadcast her first sexual activity, among other reasons, are plenty of reasons to seek it. The sex alone would be enough, but then the other activities push her over the edge. With that, the party where it all goes south as is action-packed and striking as the other film. The fire, the grand design, and the household objects used as killing instruments is very exciting to see. It had the spectacle needed to wow today's audiences, while remaining faithful to what the original showcased. It also provided more gore, which should keep those fans happy. We get one very gory double-head penetration, a full body holding CDs, a harpoon into the stomach, and several people are set on fire. This satisfies me as a gore-hound at least. It was even close to how people in high school actually behave and act. All of them are also deserving of their fates, as they all act like total snobs who get their comeuppance.The Bad News Nearly all of the action occurs at the end, which allows for some really trying moments in the first half as we get character development and all the set up. As the characters are being developed, we also have to deal with a lot of cliché developments. These have appeared in so many films that I won't even bother with telling them, as they are so easily spotted that you can do it yourself without any trouble. It also takes a while before we really get any kind of clarity in the story, so it can be quite confusing to really understand all that has been going on.The Final Verdict For some reason, this film is constantly attacked. I don't think it deserves it, and is more entertaining than many give it credit for. It isn't a classic like the original, which many hate it for. It deserves a look from fans of the first one, as it does tie up some loose ends, and fans of the genre will enjoy this as well.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, some sex scenes and a scene of a dog being run over "},{"Title":"Carrie's baby-sister is just as fiery as she was!","Date":"24 September 2005","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" It's usually not a very good idea to make a belated sequel to a horror film, especially not when the original is generally considered a genre masterpiece and from the hands of writer Stephen King and director Brian DePalma. Yet, the makers of Carrie 2 The Rage didn't make complete fools out of themselves, as it is a very entertaining and well-scripted story that appeals to both the fans of the classy original and younger horror lovers. Well, the term horror doesn't totally fit this film, because it's only the climax (last 15 minutes or so) which is bloody. The best way to describe The Rage pretty much is American Pie meets She's All That with a gory finale. The story is set in a typically American high school where the students only have sex, football and cheer-leading on their minds. The only difference is that this is the same high school were Carrie White raised a little hell 23 years earlier and now there's a new girl with telekinetic powers arriving... The unpopular Rachel Lang receives a lot of attention from the top-quarterback Jesse Ryan, and thus the rest of the sport and cheerleader team plot to humiliate her in public. They obviously didn't learn much from their school's infamous history. After a quite atmospheric intro and a suicide-sequence which pretty much is the coolest I've ever seen, The Rage becomes a little slow and it starts suffering from too many clichés. Still, during these rather dull moments there's the good acting of Emily Bergyl and Jason London to enjoy, as well as some remotely funny teenager sex-jokes. The climax is very much worth anticipating and contains some really graphic killings. The make-up effects are terrifically gruesome and some of the macabre deaths are very ingenious. This sure is a predictable and redundant film, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun.

That the film bears the name `Carrie' must have made the studio hope that some of the good features of that film would be carried (sorry) over and redeem this.  The plot tries to keep the essence of Carrie but it tries to mix in all the clichés of the modern teen movie as well &#150; and the two don't mix.  So for the majority of the film we have the normal `jocks bothering weird girl' plot and the odd scene of something breaking.The problem is that suddenly the end scene happens &#150; with little build up or trail.  From a girl ignoring her powers Rachael suddenly becomes some sort of pumped killing machine in full control of her mind.  The change is too sudden and is lazy writing.  The actual film itself is too much an average teen movie and the ending is full of deliberate gore for the audience that measures horror in those terms.  I personally found it overdone like the special effects guys were trying too hard.The director also feels like he's working too hard.  He tries to freak us out and make everything seem exciting by having tonnes of zooming cameras, changes in film stock and changes from colour to black and white.  But it all felt like a gimmick because of the material.  The film pales beside the original and just fails trying to steal bits from it &#150; even the ending is spoilt because we know to expect a `shock' ending because it's trying to do a Carrie moment.Bergl is average as Rachael &#150; she basically plays your typical Goth stereotype from all these movies.  London is OK and it's funny to see two stars of American Pie in small roles.  Irving reprises her role (with a logical crowbaring of facts) but she is wasted and is only there to provide the link to the whole mind-power stuff..  Is she this desperate for work?Overall this isn't as bad as many reviews made it sound on release.  It's an average (at best) teen/horror movie.

It must be said that this movie can barely qualify as a horror movie and instead works better as a teen drama type film. The horror content is low, there are absolutely no scary scenes in it whatsoever, instead we get in-your-face gore to make up for the lack of chills. A large part of the film concerns the developing romance between the two lead characters which is delicately handled and faintly moving. Emily Bergl is no Sissy Spacek but makes for quite a strong lead, however the scriptwriter made her far too strong a character and able to fend for herself, whereas Spacek played a mentally troubled, physically inferior girl suffering from depression and isolation. Bergl instead has friends, a close boyfriend, is attractive and disliked by only a few at school. Where's the drama in that? Where's the reason for the gory massacre that predictably closes the movie? The plot is definitely this movie's weak point. It strictly adheres to the original CARRIE, throwing off only a few different sub-plots (the 'high school sex ring leading to suicide' is a nice idea and makes for some suitably loathsome jock type characters as the villains). As the movie progresses it follows the original more and more slavishly, ending in a re-run of the massacre and even a ludicrous ending involving bad CGI work (London sees Bergl in a dream, and she shatters). Amy Irving returns from the original in a thankless role, and her character is totally extraneous to the plot. Quite a few scenes are devoted to her and Rachel's real mother, who is broken out of an asylum to come and see her daughter. At the end, it turns out that whole sub-plot was a waste of time.Jason London (JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS) has a good solid role as the jock with a heart and the various high school cliché characters are fairly solid and hateable enough. Even a pre-stardom Mena Suvari makes a brief, tragic appearance, going from her ugly duckling character here to an angelic sexual character in American Beauty. One thing I didn't like about the film was the handling of the gore content, which was over-the-top and sometimes needless. Did we need to see the dog crushed under the wheels of a moving car? These scenes are ill-judged and rather loathsome. At least the finale is entertaining enough, where the gore content is upped and we are treated to all manner of bizarre (and deserved) deaths &#x96; decapitation, impaling by CDs, drowning, blinding and my favourite, unexpected castration. Although THE RAGE CARRIE 2 is entertaining enough, it pales as a sequel to the original classic so one best ignore the first film ever happened to get a kick out of it. Otherwise you'll sit wondering just why they bothered.

When Rachel begins to date football player Jesse (Jason London) and is invited to a party by the popular kids, things appear to be looking up, but tragedy lies just around the corner.For much of its running time, The Rage is more like a high-school drama than a horror film, focussing on the trials and tribulations of teenage life; it's clichéd stuff but passes the time painlessly enough. Finally, after an hour and a half of teenage shenanigans, some weak attempts at style from Shea (unnecessary black and white scenes and distorted imagery) and a little lazy exposition to explain away Rachel's powers, the film finally delivers the horror goods with a cracking climax that sees Rachel unleashing the full force of her telekinesis on her tormentors with spectacularly gory results (including a guy getting his junk blown off by a spear-gun!).

No, it'll never recapture the 'shock value' of the original as you basically know what's coming, but it's an enjoyable horror-yarn nonetheless. If you liked the original, you shouldn't feel too aggrieved at someone cashing in on the Carrie-name after two decades.

So of course they plan on taking revenge. Meanwhile, one of the jocks (Jessie) falls for Rachel which ticks off his buddies as well as the popular girl who is head over heels for him. Sue Snell from the original film is a school counsellor now, and see's in Rachel what was in Carrie. She can move objects with her mind. That leads to a backstory which links Rachel to Carrie. Eventually, the film takes us to a huge party in which the teens humiliate Rachel which leads to a fiery conclusion.Clearly, a sequel to the original 'Carrie' was NEVER going to surpass it. But 'Carrie 2 The Rage' isn't all that be of a movie. It lacks a certain class and even creepiness that 'Carrie' had, but puts in a good effort. The acting was good from everyone involved, in particular Emily Bergl who plays the lead Rachel. They could've had Rachel be identical to Carrie White's shy and timid character, but instead Rachel is a strong and independent teenage girl. She stands up for herself and has friends. I like that switch, and Bergl plays it well. Amy Irving back as Sue Snell is something I really like as well, even if I don't like the way they end her character in this. The special effects at the conclusion with Rachel getting back at the teens was effective as well.What's missing in this which was in the original, are the catty group of girls after the lead girl. In 'Carrie', Kris and Norma were wonderfully written as the villainous bullies. Making a bunch of football jocks go after Rachel really didn't have the same effect, nor did it give off the same entertainment value that the girls gave in 'Carrie'. I did like the connection the film makes between Carrie and Rachel, so it gets points for that. Overall, I'd recommend 'Carrie 2 The Rage'. It's an effective little horror sequel that was well acted and never drags on too the point of boredom.6/10 "},{"Title":"Not As Bad As Some Say...","Date":"2 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" I thought the original Carrie was one of the most compelling movies ever, and I loved the 2002 remake as well.Having read the (mostly bad) reviews, and seeing how poor the rating is (it was barely above 4.0 at the time), I expected the worst. Maybe that's the reason I was pleasantly surprised.But I can't get over how minor Mena Suvari's role was! If they insist on casting good looking girls to portray supposedly ugly misfits, they should have given Mena Suvari the lead role; who is Emily Bergl!? That 'popular' girl with goggles -- *she* looks like a reject; even Rachel is better looking than any of the popular girls, let alone Mena Suvari. What I'm trying to say is thumbs down for the casting.I didn't appreciate the whole sexual score premise (especially with the underage); it was a bit too creepy for my liking. And how are you supposed to feel any sympathy for the lead male when he's involved in the game? Sue Snell's character was severely underdeveloped/underused, and the Carrie reference is a bit lame. Those flashbacks didn't really fit into the context of the movie.Other than that, it's a (more or less) entertaining film. The death scenes are better than those in the original Carrie or the 2002 remake.Worth a look. Definitely.

The Brian De Palma horror / drama classic of 1976 wasn't exactly crying out to be sequelized, but this belated film came (23 years after the original) anyway. It tells basically the same story, except this time the victimized high school girl, here named Rachel (the appealing Emily Bergl) is decidedly more confident and outgoing, albeit still something of an outcast. Rachel's best friend Lisa (Mena Suvari) commits suicide after callous treatment by a stereotypical jock, but she won't be aware of just how rotten the guy and his friends are until late in the film. Until then, she's romanced by Jesse (Jason London), who's one of that clique but substantially more conscientious. Meanwhile, original survivor Sue Snell (Amy Irving returns to reprise the role) is now the psychiatrist at Rachel's school and sees the warning signs early Rachel has telekinetic abilities. One has to be amused by Irving's involvement, especially when they get a load of her hilarious / ridiculous final scene. Flashbacks to the 1976 film also serve to remind us of what came before, and director Katt Shea (who stepped in to replace Robert Mandel as director) gives the proceedings a bit of style, using things like black & white photography - however, there's no split screen this time around. In addition to the jocks, other stereotypical characters abound, like bitchy girlfriends and nerds (such as Suvari's American Pie co-star Eddie Kaye Thomas (Finchy!); this is very much your standard 90s teenager-oriented horror film, right down to the soundtrack and the rock score by Danny B. Harvey. That's not to say that some of these characters aren't entertaining, such as Zachery Ty Bryan's lowlife jock (his comeuppance is a definite highlight). The supporting cast includes people like Dylan Bruno as smarmy ringleader Mark, John Doe as Rachel's foster parent Boyd, Gordon Clapp as Bryan's attorney father, Rachel Blanchard as Monica, and Eli Craig, future director of Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, as Chuck. They all help to make this watchable enough, but the climactic, fiery showdown / bloodbath is quite entertaining and comparable to the fatal prom night of Carrie '76. The end also manages to at least be somewhat touching. The script, however, makes the dumb decision of an absurd plot revelation in order to further connect the two films. (You'll know it when it happens.) When all is said and done, this isn't really a bad film, just an unnecessary one. (Of course, that could apply to any number of sequels, prequels, and remakes.)

Makes sense that he'd have an illegitimate child out there. Enter Rachel (Emily Bergl), more of an underdog than nerdy recluse. Dark, gloomy, Gothic and stealthily gorgeous, Rachel becomes slightly unglued when her best friend (Mena Suvari) commits suicide after being dumped by a jock who, along with his fellow muscular dimwits, has a notebook with the names of their post-virginal conquests a clever devise making these guys primed to be butchered and burned - but we'll get to that.Through a fledgling mid section, Amy Irving, returning as Sue Snell &#x96; the only survivor of the original &#x96; investigates Rachel's past. Sue's a counselor who recognizes similar traits in this troubled teen, especially the art of moving things around at will. Sporadic flashes to Sissy Spacek using her telekinetic powers, and eventually going bonkers, is not only blasphemous to horror fanatics but fails to connect this shallow interpretation with Brian De Palma's classic.And it's no surprise that everyone will be in one place by the very end for Rachel to go to town. A raging rave party full jocks (including Rachel's boyfriend &#x96; one good looking guy who's actually nice) and banal beauties provide the necessary oven of madness, yet it occurs so quickly, with an overabundance of special effects, there's nothing scary or eerie about it &#x96; John Rambo could have showed up with an M60 and it wouldn't be any different.With all the flaws, the twist ending &#x96; mirroring the original's hand reaching from the grave &#x96; does provide an effective 11th hour chill.

It's really a well done teen horror movie. Kudos to Emily Bergl (Rachel) and the rest of the supporting cast. Whoever cast this movie did a great job from the actors who played the popular crowd to the guy who played the police officer. All their performances were understated & subtle..not at all over the top. Loved hating....the characters of Mark & Eric. Jerks!!!!* They deserved their horrible demise. I loved the romance that developed between Jesse and Rachel. It was sweet. I could see how these two teens could be attracted to each other at that moment in their lives. It's shocking how well this 10 year old plot holds up even now.I watched this movie for a 2nd time. And I really really liked it.This wasn't a typical horror film about some girl who gets her feelings hurt and knocks off the entire student body. There's much more beneath the surface than that.I get where the director and writer were going with this picture. If they had more time and the director was Katt Shea from the beginning I think the movie would have been even better. The movie is written with intelligence and the performances are true to life. They did a good job of tying the details together the best they could.I love all the nuggets included in the movie... all of which are subtleThe foreshadowing of Rachel being a mass murderer - remember Rachel in the diner covered in her dog's blood post car accident.... the other patrons in the diner are staring her down ...Rachel is wondering why.... Jesse remarks Don't worry you look like a mass murderer. Then she remembers she's covered in her dog's blood.The reference to Romeo and Juliet - tragic love that is intense and fast. Just like Titantic. If 2 people can fall in love in a few days on the Titanic why not high school.Character of Jesse - loved his character. Jesse the passive nice guy jock.It's clear from his reactions to his friends' (the popular crowd) insensitive comments throughout the movie, he's tired of their immaturity.Some examples....- Tracy comments that Lisa Parker was a nobody- Tracy and Monica ask the question with venom Who would love Rachel- Mark makes an inappropriate remark about Lisa to Rachel in his attempt to retrieve the pictures.- One of the football players calls Lisa a coyote.In his passive way.... Jesse makes it known he doesn't like what they are saying but Jesse isn't confrontational.Note that Mark (the leader of the group) makes the suggestion to Jesse early in the picture that he should get with Tracy. Mark probably pushed Jesse into having sex with her. Jesse clearly doesn't stand up to Mark because a few scenes later... Jesse loses his virginity to Tracy, which Jesse regrets immediately. I loved Jesse's reaction post sex...he couldn't wait for his friends to leave.) Jesse wants out of this group and the pressure that goes with them. Recall he tells Rachel on their date that it must be nice not to have to conform.Character of Mark - is the leader of the popular crowd. He is in control. He tells people what to do and they do it. The actor who played Mark was great. Mark & Jesse Relationship -Best Friends since they were dumping in their draws - Jesse clearly has never stood up to Mark until he meets Rachel. Jesse tells Mark to back off Rachel (see the locker room scene). Again pretty true to his character setup he approaches the initial confrontation passively to start with.Recording Jesse and Rachel - Was the videotaping of Jesse and Rachel making love really about revenge against Rachel or was Mark really getting back at Jesse for disrespecting him and his group. Recall by the time Mark comes up with his videotaping plan, we have already learned that Eric will not be charged with anything so what's the point. The point is Mark is still mad at his best friend... plus Tracy's comments about how Jesse is flaunting his relationship with Rachel in public only fuel Mark to teach Jesse a lesson about respect(Watch the lunchroom scene with Monica, Mark, Brad and Tracy)Also ...watch the scene of Mark and Eric on the balcony before Rachel arrives at the party. With no statutory rape looming over his head Eric gloats about how the college scout loved his killer instinct. Mark is not remotely interested anymore. His focus is now on breaking up Jesse/Rachel. Getting Jesse where it hurts.... humiliating Rachel and putting his former friend in his place. IMHO Rachel is a casualty of the prank not the focus of it.But recognize, our girl Rachel made them regret their prank. I would put this movie in my top 20 films. I see the potential of this story.I am definitely purchasing this movie.I would highly recommend it. FYI It's on Cinemax.

Plotwise, we find that the girl here had the same father as the original Carrie, and Amy Irving, a survivor from the first flic, reprises her role. The biggest surprise is Irving's last scene. Otherwise, there can't be any other surprises since, as mentioned, this is a repetition of the original picture.

There's not much connection between the two films, and one gets the feeling that the producers weren't sure whether The Rage should be considered a sequel to Carrie or its own beast. After all, it could certainly work on its own, although anyone with any film knowledge would quickly realize the great debt it owes to Carrie in terms of its theme, characters, and storyline.The two films follow exactly the same narrative path An unpopular outcast is drawn into the in crowd only to be humiliated in front of a large group, at which time her anger becomes so intense that she unleashes the fury of her telekinetic powers on everyone around her. This climax--a mind-induced massacre of evil high school kids and the poor innocents caught in the crossfire--was the high point of De Palma's film, and director Katt Shea (Poison Ivy) tries in vain to top it in The Rage. Unfortunately, Shea has not an inkling of De Palma's lyrical camera strength or perverse sense of humor, and so she overwhelms the audience with gore instead of suspense.This gory massacre is good only for visual shock value, and it carries little of the unexpected primal rage of Carrie's telekinetic vengeance at the prom 20 years earlier. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Oh Brian DePalma How We Miss You!","Date":"9 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  Granted that The Rage Carrie 2 was a movie that didn't need to be made and granted that The Rage Carrie 2 is inferior to the original in every single possible way, it still isn't a horrible film. Stephen King wrote a nifty novel that really put its finger on something about teenage girls -- or rathere, more appropriately, something about why men fear teenage girls. Brian DePalma and Sissy Spacek were the perfect pair to bring his vision to the screen. But under the appropriately exploitative direction of Katt Shea, some of the basic elements of the plot remain emotionally effective.Actually, the basic elements of the plot are strikingly similar. In fact, you kind of get the impression that writer Rafael Moreu basically rewrote the original and then had to change a few things. The prom becomes a post-football party. The boyfriend goes from the awesome William Katt and his curly waist length hair to the blandly innocuous Jason London. Instead of Betty Buckley's gym teacher trying in vain to help the telekinetic teen, we get the return of Sue Snell (Amy Irving) whose nightmare at the end of the original is one of cinema's great gotcha moments. But basically, Moreu respects the story arcs of the original.Ugly-duckling Rachel Lang (newcomer Emily Bergl) has secret powers that she can't control in moments of rage. She's a bit of an outcast, but she has a couple friends, including pre-American Pie Mena Suvari and Eddie Kay Thomas. But we quickly find out that the football players at their school has a sortta Spur Posse thing going where they bed girls and get a seemingly arbitrary number of points for each girl. When Suvari falls victim to one of the jocks and kills herself, Rachel is alone. Oh, and did I mention that Rachel's mother is locked up and insane and that her father... Well, let's just say Rachel has some connections to that ultimate high school pariah Carrie White. Seeing the opportunity to correct history, Sue Snell tries to do for Rachel what she couldn't do for Carrie. And in the process gives an absolutely ridiculous lecture to her about telekinesis being a recessive hereditary condition... And you just know that when all the kids are talking about a big party... something bad just might happen.On one hand, Katt Shea is the perfect person to direct this movie. Shea is a master of trash cinema (Poison Ivy and Stripped to Kill are career highlights). She milks her camera angles and swirling moves for all she's worth. Echoing and correcting DePalma's classic girl's locker room scene from the original, she manages to set three different scenes in the men's football locker room. But to keep the guys interested, she makes sure that Rachel, being taunted by evil football players, for some reason chooses to answer the door in a towel. Shea also milks the violence for all she's worth, unblinkingly depicting several versions of bloody carnage. Still, she's no DePalma. No matter how fancy her moves, she can't achieve the operatic carnage the steered the last thirty minutes of Carrie.As our new fashion misfit, Emily Bergl is sensitive and meek in early scenes, but she's probably too attractive. The film lacks the wonderful moment of revelation where we discovered that even homely Sissy Spacek could be beautiful. Despite the fact that she was 23 when the film was made, she actually looks like a high school student. The same can't be said for Jason London, who looks every bit of thirty. Ditto Dylan Bruno who plays Rachel's principle torturer. In fact, the females all look the right age and the men all look like yuppies. It makes for a strange mix.The film also suffers from a lack of interesting adult roles. Buckley was fine in the original, but Piper Laurie's terrifying presence is missing. You know it's missing because Laurie's famous They're all going to laugh at you is sampled several times in this new film.For its first hour The Rage works by making you sympathize with Rachel. You know where the story's going, so the pathos kicks in early. Shea keeps the pace moving well during that time. But as the film approaches its big bloody climax nothing seems exactly right. You miss the endless circling of Katt and Spacek at the prom. You miss Nancy Allen's evil glee (totally lacking in Rachel Blanchard and Charlotte Ayanna in this movie). So the final result just isn't satisfying enough.As a final note, I'd like to make a plea to all teen movie writers That scene where the students are in English class and a blow-hard teacher is lecturing them on a book that just happens to have the same theme as the movie they're in? It's a dramatic crutch that suggests you don't have enough intelligence to make points on your own. So the teacher in The Rage is babbling about Romeo and Juliet and London and Bergl have a moment. Are we supposed to believe that they're star-crossed lovers? She's telekinetic. He's boring. Will they find love? That's just lame. This movie, though, isn't better than a 5/10.

Jason London, as the only sympathetic high-school jock, is also good.  The film's depiction of high school as a Hell zone is an accurate updating of the original to contemporary times.  Katt Shea's direction also has its moments of brilliance that approach Brian De Palma's level shown in the original.The bad points (possible **SPOILERS**) The rest of the jocks (save for London) are all thoroughly despicable.  Amy Irving, who returns from the original, is not nearly given enough to do.  The script invents what has to be the lamest possible explanation for Rachel's telekinesis.  Using clips from the original film to link the two movies together points out the weaknesses of the sequel and the original's considerable strengths.  The film finally goes off the rails in the overboard blood-and-gore finale, a reworking of the original's climax (in a rich kid's mansion) without its tragedy or drama.In summation, CARRIE 2, up until the climax, is a well-above-average teen shocker.

The director of The Rage Carrie 2 managed to take a well-known and popular horror tale and transform it into a smoldering piece of feminist propaganda. The story opens with Rachel (Emily Bergl), a pretty high school outcast whose best friend has just been seduced as part of a deflowering game played by hunky jocks. After her best friend subsequently commits suicide, and the District Attorney refuses to prosecute the deflowerer for statutory rape, Rachel goes nuts seeking revenge. Loosely based on real-life events, (Don't laugh, I'm not talking about the telekenisis. In 1993 an actual case occurred in Lakewood, CA where a group of boys deflowered dozens of girls as a game.) The Rage Carrie 2 goes downhill from the get-go. Shea, obviously incensed by the way the male body works, pillories the jocks for having hormones, and vilifies the community as nothing but an old boys' club where no female can get justice. Shea even has the nerve to insert herself into a scene at the DA's office where she, fighting for justice, is overruled by the old boys' club male DA who declines to punish the boy for his indiscretion. But it gets worse--laughable even. Shea figures the best revenge is to hit men where it hurts. She ensures the deflowerer pays for his crime--a girl ends up firing a spear gun through the offending groin. How bitter can someone be? Shea should be ashamed of herself for taking an excellent series of characters and melting them down into nothing but feminist hobbyhorses.Memo to Katt Shea consensual sex isn't a crime. Making movies like The Rage Carrie 2 should be.  "},{"Title":"great movie","Date":"27 October 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  I loved this movie.

I can never tell if people just expect too much or something altogether different.  It WAS NOT an exact carbon copy of the first Carrie, which somebody said.  It had the same basic story and concept, but with the modern gore and effects.  The Rage part towards the end was definitely something to remember.  The thing that made this movie scary was the fact that they weren't holding back on what gore they were showing.  I wasn't sure what they were going to show next....a perfect example would be the way they showed the girl jumping off the building and going head first into the windshield of a car.  That was horrible.****SPOILER****And about the ending.  If you saw the first movie, you know that they ended it with some sweet music, making you think that it was ending with a sense of peace, and then there's that SHOCK that brings you to reality.  They did the same thing with this movie, and what made it worse....was the fact that I actually had thoughts of them possible making a happier ending, and I'm thinking hmmm, maybe there's actually a nice ending.  He was the only one that loved her, so maybe she REALLY did come back.

I admit - if I had gone and seen the movie thinking that it would be Oscar-winning stuff I would have been in for a serious disappointment! I found that most of the characters in the movie were very likeable (unlike some other recent horror films). The story was pretty solid throughout the whole thing - not too boring. The scene at the party (which is very similar to the prom scene in the original movie) was a bit too gruesome for my liking. Some parts of the movie are so STUPID that I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions... And it wasn't scary. The scariest parts of The Rage were the flashbacks from Carrie!

"},{"Title":"Better than expected, but nothing more","Date":"14 September 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  The Rage Carrie 2 is much better than it has any right to be. The film is well-acted, expertly crafted, and does a remarkably good job at getting the viewer involved in its derivative story. The decision to make a belated sequel to a 23-year old horror classic could have met with disaster, and I was initially shocked that Hollywood would even want to try it, considering the financial hardship Broadway met with after they tried to create a musical stage version (!) of Stephen King's story a few years after the original film came out. But the final result is surprisingly watchable, and it's certainly a cut above the many half-assed horror sequels that have wasted valuable screen space over the past year, such as Species II and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. There is, however, one crucial element that Carrie 2 sorely lacks a reason for even existing in the first place.Basically, the film just rehashes the standard plotline of the original, and adds very few new elements of its own to the proceedings. The only difference this time is that the lead character is named Rachel, not Carrie (which renders the title completely meaningless, but never mind). Rachel is a teenage outcast (but, as usual, is far more attractive than most of the outcasts we know in real life), who inadvertently ends up getting the more popular kids at her school into trouble. They decide to play a very cruel practical joke on her in retaliation, which relies on Jesse, the school's most likable jock, asking her out. He ends up really falling in love with her, however, and just as Rachel begins to feel accepted for the first time in her life, the bad kids go through with their prank. But having just recently found out that she is Carrie's illegitimate sister and has inherited her power of telekinesis, Rachel decides to utilize that gift to ensure that they will not live to see college. The only survivor of this ordeal ends up receiving the jolt of their life in the epilogue. Sounds a little familiar, doesn't it? The only real surprise in the film evolves from the subplot involving Rachel's abusive foster family. After the drunken father smacks her around a bit, one's expecting a rehash of the riveting finale in the original where Carrie vented all her rage against her religiously hysterical mother, but the character completely disappears from the picture!Most of the picture's energy is devoted to the climactic sequence when Rachel finally vents her rage against her peers. It's actually quite entertaining since the filmmakers come up with some delightfully over-the-top ways for the kids to perish. Yet it doesn't pack near the same emotional wallop as the prom set piece from the original since it doesn't add anything new to the formula. And that's a shame because newcomer Emily Bergl is terrific in the lead, and does an impressive job at measuring up to Sissy Spacek's remarkable performance in the original. It is because of her that the film is as involving as it is, and the love story between her and Jesse is surprisingly sweet. It is actually more interesting than the relationships we see in most straight teen romance films these days. There are many elements of Carrie 2 that work quite well and since the basic story is one that we can all identify with, the film is able to hold one's interest from beginning to end. It's just too bad the picture as a whole is so routine. Just because a horror sequel is watchable does not mean that it is particularly invigorating.

And that would be fine if only they'd leave 'em be. The friend kills herself after learning she lost her virginity for 4 points.

They told me I didn't miss much while I was gone, either. I was generally offended by the entire movie, in such a grand way that I can't even describe it.  My gut instinct told me to get myself out of the theatre.  It was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie.  The plot centered around the cruel actions of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others.  There was no ray of light, no resonsible or likeable person to provide contrast.  I found that even the good guys of the movie did nothing for me, were silly, stupid, whiney, or just plain ineffectual.The repetitious, graphic suicide imagery was way overdone, unnecessary, and disgusting.  (Not in a I'm easily grossed out way, but more in the portrayal of disregard for humanity way).  And besides the repetition of that scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, the other visual aspects, (interesting camera work, etc) had potential, but just became annoying sometimes. I am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. Usually I can find some good things to counterbalance the not-so-good of any movie.  I'm not saying that this movie had nothing good, but I am saying that, whatever that may have been, I can't remember it with all the other crap that drove me mad.  I'm really sorry about that, too.

One good thing about this film was the movie went by relatively quickly, because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachel's best friend died there was no funeral mentioned in the movie. Another bring down was the involvement of Amy Irving. All her scenes brought down the movies pace. The dialog in this movie was terrible. It in no way reflected the way kids talk.

Carrie was so good, so I guess it made sense that the writer copied the film's format. I, however, have a few questions for the writer. 1. Why would the remains of the charred, destroyed old high school still be behind the new high school over twenty years later? 2. What teenager says the word swank? 3. Shouldn't Rachel have mourned over her friend's suicide rather than go to football games and parties? 4. Why did Rachel's parents ground her from going to school? I also had problems with the acting in the film. The performance that many of the actors gave were unconvincing at best. Were we supposed to believe that Amy Irving cared about Rachel? Personally I was lost in her monotone dialogue, and her performance was only just better than Jason London's. That scene before Rachel is killed was hilarious, rather than being the film's emotional climax.

I actually wanted to go see it in the theater when it got some not-too-bad reviews, but no-one would see it with me. The movie had its good and bad points. On the bad side, there were a couple of really unbelievable plot elements, like the fact that Sue Stern would take Rachel (I think that was her name) to the ruins of the old high school, that still happened to be standing like it had burned down a couple of weeks ago instead of over 20 years ago. I get that she had to explain things to her, but that was just stupid. There's a killing thrown in towards the end that seems thrown in just to shock, and I'm surprised the actress agreed to it, not like she needs the money (if you saw it, you know who I mean).  John Doe wasn't in it enough (and they made him look like crap. Yeah, I know his part wasn't that intregal to the plot, so what?). They just flat out-steal techniques from the first one such as switching to slow-motion footage of her walking in front of the flames. If you've seen the first one, it's easy to tell where the plot of the movie is going. Of course, this movie being made at all was pretty unnecessary, the first one was a masterpiece. Obviously, it probably wouldn't have been made if there weren't the whole teen-horror craze going on that they wanted to cash in on. But, it could have been worse. It got the element that the first one had of high school being a really dangerous and nasty place, and (if you are old enough) makes you REALLY glad that you are out of there. It had characters that you really cared about and wanted things to work out for. It also had characters you really, really hated that you are hoping will get what's coming to them, in a really horrible way. It also had a really memorable, scary epilogue, that wasn't a total rip-off of the first one and was actually original (and sad). The original was about 50 times better, but at least this one doesn't insult your intelligence and has some decent characters with some depth to them, unlike most of the crap in the same teen-horror genre like say, Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer.

And out of sheer boredom and lack of anything else at the rental store to pick up, I finally went ahead and picked it up. Now I own the Rage, but will never buy the De Palma original. I like this sequel simple because it feels more complete with its character and story arcs. It feels more real with more believable characters, and in fact my biggest gripes lay in the attempts to link Rachel to Carrie with the ever-lame 'coincidentally related somehow but no one knew yet everyone on the audience saw it coming.' Oh yes, and no annoying De Palma split-screen-city, no camera nauseatingly rotating around its subject matter for a seemingly endless period of time, and the 'clever' Bernard Herrmann rip-off motif surrounding telekinesis is mercifully downplayed. In Carrie we had to watch someone completely disconnected from the real world deal with her screwed up mother and her abuse and mistreatment at school. This 'outsider' feel for Carrie was supposed to make us sympathize with her; however, King went too far and started reaching into the fields of lameness with it. I typically like King's writing, but Carrie I could not buy into. The Rage remedies this by making Rachel a part of her generation - she's still an outcast and naïve on many popularity field accounts - but Rachel is still part of her generation. Realistically, who are you more likely to run into? A rejected freak who still is knowledgeable about everyday life and times or someone who might as well have been in a coma her entire life and just woke up? Also the music caught my attention - a surprisingly good score and to my knowledge this is Danny B. Harvey's only feature film score, sadly. It's not revolutionary material, it won't define/influence horror music for the next twenty years like Goldsmith, Williams, and Herrmann have done, but the Rage's score does its job and does it well.The downsides? The sequel tries to mirror its predecessor in too many categories, especially the ending. The way to go would've been to give nods with minor references for the observant to find, non-plot essential items so that the rage could be its own story and not just an adaptation/retelling for the original. Jason London's performance annoys me, especially towards the end of the film . . . and how does Rachel go from no control over her power and thinking it all in her head to magically knowing how to use it with marksman precision for the film's inevitable finale?

The original was Brian DePalma's Carrie, which remains, in my opinion, a dazzling thriller and an amazing character study. That's why it worked so well and the sequel plays it too safe.The casting is one problem. The original cast Sissy Spacek as Carrie, who turned in an incredible performance. This sequel does not have any big names (Amy Irving does appear as the sole survivor of the first film) and while that strategy worked with the original film, it doesn't work this time. No one is particularly memorable and the Carrie knockoff this time (played by Emily Bergl, in a performance that killed her career before it even started) is far too normal for the story to pay off.That brings me to problem # 2. The story is an absolute mess. DePalma and Stephen King, who wrote the original novel, had the courage to present unlikable and unstable characters in the original. Here, everyone is far too restrained for the film to work. ***SPOILER*** Here, supposedly Carrie's father had another family and that the telekenesis is a recessive trait (Most critics, particularly Roger Ebert, brought up the point that telekinesis should be a DOMINANT trait; but how many people will pick up on it? Sometimes it's such a curse to be so logical and sharp, but enough of that rant...)The massacre sequence is decent, but not the knockout DePalma's was. The ending is particularly awful, considering the heart-in-throat approach of the 1976 original that worked so well. This film is such a mess that not even a genius like Brian DePalma could have fixed it. My advice is to see the DePalma film and read the original Stephen King novel.

Rachel is an outcast as well whose best friend has just committed suicide after being dumped by a jock who used her for sex. Now, another of the jocks has his eye on Rachel, but the catch is he really does like her. However, his friends cannot seem to handle this so they hatch a scheme to get Rachel for revealing the relationship one of the jocks had with her dead friend. Amy Irving also returns as Sue Snell, a guidance counselor who recognizes Rachel's power, and becomes very worried. From this point the movie goes even farther downhill as the jocks develop an almost ridiculously elaborate plot to embarrass Rachel. The big showdown comes where Rachel is humiliated by their vicious prank and she lets loose her rage, and the conclusion of the original Carrie is basically remade with few alterations.This is a horrible movie with a poor script and terrible acting.

As you watch that, you can feel the heat between the two.  Yet nothing tops the part when Rachel's anger takes over and destroys those who has betrayed and tortured her.  The effects during that scene were pure movie magic, terrifying, bloody, but left you in full surprise and shock.  This is indeed a really great movie!  I highly recommend this movie!

He rejects her and she commits suicide. Rachel tells school counselor Sue Snell (Amy Irving) and Sheriff Kelton. Sue pushes Kelton to charge Eric for statutory rape.

Emily Bergl is a bit too old to play a teenager and so is Jason London. Sissy Spacek was so much better and she looked so innocent. Everything like the constant flashback to the original reminds me how much better that was. Amy Irving's return helps a little but in other ways, she doesn't help at all. Her investigation diverges attention away from the schoolmates. It's also questionable how easily she is pulled into the party. The special effects are generally poor until the last section when the film throws everything into it. This is a weak sequel to a horror classic.

At the time, the affair struck me as deeply crass. How do you sequelize a story where the main character died at the end? More importantly, why would you sequelize a powerful, beloved classic like Carrie? The truth is The Rage is just as much remake as sequel, a similarly structured but unrelated screenplay that was converted into a sequel to DePalma's classic when the similarities where recognized.The sequel elements are easily spotted as hastily bolted on. The Rage Carrie 2 isn't about a girl named Carrie but a girl named Rachel. In order to distinguish it from the original, Rachel's crazy religious fanatic mom is carted off to the crazy house early on, leaving the girl with a foster home. 1999's outcast isn't a socially awkward misfit with no fashion sense and a bugnuts mom. Instead, Rachel is a snarky, Daria-like quasi-goth who dresses in black, has wavy hair, a tattoo, and listens to Garbage, NIN, and Marilyn Manson. Really? Rachel's powers are awakened when her equally gothy best friend kills herself. The motivation for the suicide? She was deflowered by a local jock as part of a dude-bro frat-game of sleeping with girls and assigning points based on attractiveness and social standing. Harsh. Rachel telekinetic powers slowly manifest while she's being tormented by the school jocks, their girlfriends, courted by one of the not-so-mean jocks, and sorta' deals with her jerk foster parents. To further the connection between the two films, Amy Irving returns as Sue Snell, now a guidance counselor at the rebuilt Bates High. After recognizing Rachel's powers, she tries to prevent another telekinetic massacre from happening. Spoiler alert She fails.The original Carrie wasn't a revenge fantasy, instead a inevitable tragedy. The creators of The Rage didn't get that memo. Transforming the Carrie stand-in from a true social outcast to someone who chooses to be a social outcast, a too-cool-for-social-hierarchy high school hipster, negates much of the point. Carrie was bullied because teenagers are evil. Rachel is targeted by a school-wide conspiracy from the cool kids to punish the unpopulars. In the original, Sue Snell's character arc was based around a bully becoming self-aware and trying to atone for her past jerkery. In The Rage, the tormentors are cartoonishly vile. The football players are borderline date-rapist, invested in complex sadistic plots, and only concerned for their own well beings. Which, in the shallow world of this movie, translate to getting a sports scholarship and remaining popular. Being directly responsible for a girl's suicide weights on their conscious none at all. The girlfriends are equally shallow, defined solely by their hatred of Rachel. Why do they hate her? She transgressed the high school social bindings by dating a football player, shock, gasp. Carrie's rampage was an example of cruelty only begetting cruelty. Rachel's inevitable rampage is a righteous quest of revenge, for her friend's death and her own humiliation. She's doubtlessly the hero of the film, her victims deserving of their deaths. She doesn't die consumed by her own imperfections. Instead, Rachel sacrifices her life to save a loved one. The innocent bystanders that are killed in the cross-fires warrant no mention by the script.Perhaps judging The Rage against the original is unfair. Does it stand up on its own? Nope. Katt Shea, of Poison Ivy and Stripped to Kill fame, directs with an inelegant hand. Scenes are frequently punctuated with blinding white light, senselessly. Rachel is prone to having slow-motion flashbacks to earlier scenes. Most obnoxiously, the film switches to black and white a few times. The attempts to scare are facile and weightless. A moment where the jocks taunt Rachel from outside her home is deeply embarrassing. The ringleader calls her, talks in a Donald Duck voice, and asks her what her favorite scary movie is. Seriously! They click the lights off, the camera swooshes around dramatically, and things go from color to black and white.The moments that blatantly recall the original are worse. Rachel's mom's religious-nuttery manifests itself by painting walls. At the end, when she appears to comfort her daughter at death, she sees Rachel as a little girl again and starts ranting about the devil, despite being sane earlier. As far as massacre triggers go, I suppose having your first time recorded and broadcast to everyone is no less humiliating then getting pig's blood poured you. Maybe, but it certainly lacks the same visceral punch. Once the stuff hits the psychic fan, Rachel's tormentors don't run in panic, but plan to kill her back. The hand suddenly grabbing an ankle gag is recycled, much less effectively. We have a jump-scare ending, of course, but it's meaningless, without any effect on the plot. Even the clips from the '77 original come off badly, crassly inserted at random.There's not much to recommend about The Rage. Emily Bergl does decently in the lead. She's likable enough and has decent chemistry with the otherwise flat Dylan Bruno. I like that Amy Irving was wrangled into returning. Sue Snell becoming a guidance councilor is a natural move, the only one in the script. The original Carrie's rampage has become the stuff of urban legend, the burnt-out remains of the original Bates High still standing. The climatic carnage features some clever gore gags, a double impalement with a fire poker, spear gun castration, exploding eyeballs, and murderous flying CDs.It's cool but the original Carrie wasn't about gore. It was about people and emotions, something beyond the grasp of this stupid film. The movie has its defenders, mostly as a source of nineties nostalgia. Maybe it's not fair to compare The Rage Carrie 2 to the original. Yet all it does is remind you of that vastly superior film. No, it doesn't stand on its own merits. It's a crappy piece of crap.

Some characteristics This feature has more user reviews than average, but not the huge number of the most popular features. At October 2010 the rating was 4.3 out of 10, fairly low. But while some user reviews rate this sequel very low, others rate it high. The 4.3 is just an average of that. Most negative that I browsed considered the horror to be too weak. I personally am glad that it was not stronger. I do not plan to seek out the original, which is supposed to be horror-ly horror. * The Rage Carrie 2 (1999) starts in a way that I found to be seriously scary. First viewing, not second viewing. Then the central character is carted away to a castle built for those who understand that they are Napoleon or God or who are just seriously hurt and confused. A castle for the seriously hurt and one knows that their wounds will be healed as one sees that character at the end of the story, if one does not stay for the end there are always stories such as True, True, Lie (2006). The rest of the time this is not the same sort of story. There is a new central character and the tone and meaning changes because of that. The first was raised in Old Time Religion and had a need to understand the events of the story in that way. A very limited and chained understanding of Old Time Religion, OTR at its worse. The second central character does not have a clue re what the scary reality is about. She is asked to believe that the causality comes from genetics and does not appear to find that easy to accept. The events that triggered the first to say goodbye to a solid grounding in sensible ways are still there with the second, who is lost and afraid, but not in the same way as the first was lost and afraid. Genetics versus the land of the penguins, LinUx, versus etc. I find the whole thing, including the fires, to be a parable about some central aspects that mould reality. It can also be read as a story about winners and losers, some background notes and footnotes about winners and losers. Or popular kids versus the rest. I interpret The Grudge (2004) as relating to this sort of thing from a winners' perspective. Wet Hot American Summer (2001) has this sort of theme as a sub plot. That has a winners' perspective about that particular plot element, while being mostly a story about the confused. The 'winner' perspective appears to be dominant. My user reviews disagree, but score low by helpfulness ratings. My user review of Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince expands on my perspective and again scores low. Carrie 2 is from a very different perspective and that 4.3 has a natural symbolic fit. Rachel would be boiling if she lived just now. * Trivia Emily Bergl who plays the lead, Rachel Lang, and who occasionally looks very age 16ish was born in England on 25th April 1975 and so was actually age 23ish. Pity that IMDb appears to have stopped showing the ages of such actors. Still, anniversary number 20 would never be horror.

Granted, the plot is mirrored in some ways, but not in all. Emily Bergl delivers a satisfying performance as the main character, but there are definitely some plot inconsistencies. First off, why on Earth would the high school leave all the wreckage of the first film there? Even with Sue Snell's explanation, it leaves a lot to be desired. I also don't like how all of a sudden Rachael suddenly decided to believe and perfectly well control and use her powers. And another fundamental from the first film I was angry they left out the fact that the outcast was not only antagonized at school, but their home life too was a living Hell. I expected Piper Laurie to jump out from behind a bathroom door somewhere and attack the whole movie. But nothing. I also hate how the jock supposedly fell in love with the girl. The most popular boy in school does not fall in love with the least popular girl. The first one was more solid in that respect, where the boy was asked to take the girl by his girlfriend so she could atone. That brings me to another thing. No stunning inciting incident pertaining to the girl either.Other than those issues however, this movie was all right. More gory than the first. The pool cover part gave me chills. Solid acting.

That's a little bit sad for Emily Bergl the flashbacks make you aware that whereas Bergl is doing a good job, Sissy Spacek she ain't. (Speaking of which, will someone please cast Emily Bergl in a decent movie? In The Rage Carrie 2 you get the feeling that she might be a good actress, but so far - with stuff like Happy Campers - she hasn't been able to prove that.)Apart from the flashbacks, The Rage also borrowed Amy Irving for the sequel. It's not sure why she's in this movie they probably cast her because she'd be able to connect Rachel's 'problem' to Carrie's, but really, couldn't another psychologist make the link to telekinesis just as well as Sue Snell (who proves that it isn't because you threw tampons at a girl having her first period that you can't become a school's psychologist)?It's almost as if Carrie 2 wants to be compared to the original movie. Both films follow the same path, so you can predict that, just like Carrie, the sequel will also have a scene where Rachel will punish all those who taunted her in a merciless way. Carrie is still famous for that finale where Brian de Palma showed you all in slow motion and a split screen. I'm not going to tell you how Carrie 2 ends and whether everyone will die or not, but Rachel's revenge is filmed with a cheap special effect (comparable to the so-called drug trips in the 60s movies). You can only wonder why did the makers of this film think they were doing as great a job as Brian de Palma that they absolutely wanted the constant references in? We can only hope not. The Rage disappoints you, even if you haven't seen the original or if you saw the original years ago. You can't say there aren't any original ideas in the film (e.g. the way Rachel's body changes when she's angry - as seen on the posters), but these original ideas are often ludicrous (why would her body change that way? Are we being prepared for The Mutation Carrie 3?).It's true that Robert Mandel (director of a.o. F/X and The X-Files pilot) left The Rage after creative differences and that Katt Shea (director of a.o. Stripped To Kill and Stripped To Kill II) took over. Maybe that explains why Carrie 2 feels uneven. Some scenes are actually quite good and some make you think that Rachel used her telekinesis 'gift' to make the script fly away. Sadly the script wasn't found anymore and they still had to shoot 65% of the film.Mena Suvari has an interesting part here disappointed after being dumped by her date, she jumps off the school building (if you blinked and missed that scene, don't worry and wait a while it's constantly repeated). Her date, a football player, only deflowered her to score some points with his friends (literally). When Sue Snell tells the sheriff, he should arrest the boy because in a way this boy used an underage girl for sex. The sheriff replies that this would be far-fetched and adds Sue, are you sure you aren't still trying to save a girl who died twenty years ago? I can't seem to shake the feeling that not many sheriffs would react that way, but that's just the way The Rage Carrie 2 is full of far-fetched dialogues. Very likely the worst example of this is the scene in the English class (and by the way, can you really say - as the teacher does - that Romeo and Juliet died together?).  If you want to see a movie where dialogue doesn't always make sense and your video store is out of badly translated Japanese films, then go and rent The Rage Carrie 2.

After all, the plot of Rage tackles a serious issue that has scandalized many high schools and communities, as seen on such news programs as Dateline NBC -- Teen-agers (usually horny male high school athletes) having sex with as many girls as possible, with the boys scoring points for their performances and the perceived quality of said girl.Mix that in with a girl who uses her telekinesis for hellacious revenge, and we've got ourselves a film.The acting wasn't even half bad. Emily Bergl brought something of a Sara Gilbert-esque (the Goth-like Darlene Conner) to her character of Rachael Lang. Amy Irving did a decent job reprising her role of Sue Snell, while Zachery Ty Bryan (Brad Taylor of Home Improvement-fame) was reliable as always.My problem lies with the execution of Rage. It was average at best. It had this plasticy feel that didn't make me really care after the movie ended. Rachael's foster parents just seemed tacked on after everything else was written (the scene where Rachael sneaks in and her foster father confronts her was poorly written).And the revenge factor was less than satisfying. Sure, we know the oversexed jocks (who are at the center of the controversey) and the girls who lured Rachael to the party get it in the end. But one point that left a sore spot for me was killing off Sue Snell. To have the audience believe that Sue was finally paid back more than 20 years after her crimes against Carrie White is insulting, to say the least.I mean, Sue was trying to HELP Rachael understand her grief (after her friend commits suicide) and who she is. But even if Rachael were uncooperative, as she often was, let the woman live. At least then Amy Irving can reprise Sue Snell in a better remake than this.That's not all. First of all, the wink-and-a-nod attitudes from the judge (who happens to be friends with the attorney father of Zachery Ty Bryan's character) and the Bates football coach. Those characterizations are affronts to decent members of both the coaching and judicial professions. The jocks' attempt at payback on Rachael could have been much better written if they had been criminally charged AND dismissed from the football team.Also, if one were to read the Stephen King novel, there's the matter of Ralph White, Carrie's father. We're to believe that he is also Rachel Lang's father, but this cannot be, since he died in February 1963 (before Carrie was even born). Sure, Ralph could have run off with another woman and his death was a story that went around to explain his absence, but I didn't see that even explained.Rage Carrie 2 could have been a worthy sequel to the original, but too many flaws spoil this show.

Carrie is for my money the best horror film of all time, and one of my favourite films, Carrie 2 was a wasted oppurtunity to make another great film on this strong dramatic premise. And for the opening 20 minutes it seems to be going great. The opening (Apart from the black and white flashes) is great, the music is on target and the cinematography is terrific (In fact the cinematography is a standout throughout the film). However after the first 20 minutes there is a dramatic change of feel to the film, and it all starts to go downhill from there.*SPOILERS*. Problems with this film are not hard to pick. The scene where the teacher foreshadows the whole premise is obvious and embarrassing. In this film Rachel is not as maladjusted as Carrie was, in fact she seems smart, cool and she doesnt seem to have a desperate need to belong. She really is part of her own group. Which makes her inevitable tragedy all that much harder to understand. Why does she want to go to a party full of people she doesnt like and who she knows for a long time haven't liked her. How does she become so nieve in the third act to fall for what they have in store. Other problems are the character of her boyfriend in the film. Not only is he too nice to have been part of the Jock Group to begin with but his character transformation to selfless lover of Racheal is impossible to swallow, especially after having slept with the villain girl of the plot the night before, and obviously having been part of their beeding contest all up until he decides he loves Racheal. Also his removal via being held up by the villian girl from the party in the third act means the film loses what could have been a great dramatic set piece for the finale of the film. Two last minor problems the villain in this only seems to have one friend which means that she isnt any more popular than racheal when it comes down to it (Racheal having been shown with a friend early in the film and also having her boyfriend later on).The ending to the film is the part which really shows it all. The character says what everyone in the audience should be feeling by this point. It is an admission of failure on the filmmakers part that they had to include this line of dialogue. Sue Snell is really an out of place character, the telekenisis is overplayed and the teacher campaigning against the Jock during the statutory rape trial is almost totally unbelievable.The few good points of this film are the Cinematography (Which really is great) the theme music, and the performance of Emily Bergl. Other than that one can only wonder what this film would have been like with a better script and if the original director had been kept (Because the replacement really lost it, sorry but its true).If there is one thing to be learnt from this film it is that filmmakers should go back to telling horror stories that derive their power from the dark emotions within the story rather than the flashy editing and blood and guts of the recent horror films that have flooded the cinemas.Also Tom Burman always does great makeup FX.

If you like gore you'll be well served (I had my hands over my eyes but I'm sure I made out a quivering brain at one point) but as for genuine soul-deep chills, which the best King adaptations (Carrie, The Shining) provide, there are none.Don't know why Jason London was in it either he's patently too old to be in high school and no one who's been in a Kevin Smith film should be reduced to this (even if it was Mallrats).However, as my summary states, there is one ray of light in this, the incomparable Eddie Kaye Thomas. Only has about five lines and still steals the movie. Even in blue camouflage combat trousers and covered in eggs. Worship at the altar of Finch, my brethren.

The Rage Carrie 2 had the potential to be a great sequel. Unfortunately, the writing is terrible, the storyline is boring, the gore is unrealistic and awful, and the ending is more or less a reprise of Carrie. Amy Irving is the only returning cast member, playing Sue, all grown up and working as a guidance counselor who spots the new Carrie's powers and investigates. This leads to a completely unbelievable revelation and Irving's bland role is cut short in a shocking scene basically repeated from the original.Bottom line If you're coming to make a sequel, make one that will at least pay respect to the original, not mock it.

Despite its obvious flaws, Carrie is a classic that I personally can watch again and again.  So, I was excited when I found out they were releasing a sequel.  Even though I knew it was going to be bad, I could not wait to see The Rage Carrie 2.  Several years later Carrie's memory is all but forgotten.  A burnt out shell remains where there once stood a high school.  Most of the witnesses, most of the people who knew Carrie, are dead.  If you recall, she killed them with her telekinetic powers.Rachel Lang doesn't know it yet, but she is a half sister to Carrie.  Apparently they share the same dead beat dad.  Dad seems to have a thing for nutty women because Rachel's mother is religious freak, just like Carrie's, only she has been institutionalized.  Oh, and Rachel also has telekinetic powers.Rachel isn't the quiet shy type like her older sister.  Updated for the nineties, this film presents Rachel as a girl with guts who has no trouble standing up to the people that think she is a freak.  As the story goes, the school jocks have been playing a little game where they earn points for every girl they can bang.  One of them gets a chance with Rachel's best friend and after he dumps her she commits suicide.  Enter the school shrink. Amy Irving reprises her role as Sue Snell.  She tried to help Carrie once, but it all backfired.  Since then she has been on a mission to help unpopular girls everywhere.  The suicide issue leads her to Rachel and they begin talking.  The jocks fear that Rachel might know something that could incriminate them so of course, a plan is hatched to get back at Rachel. I don't have to tell you what happens next.I knew this was going to be a bad film before I saw it, I just didn't know how bad.  The Rage doesn't work for me, even as a B movie, mainly because it tries to hard, and fails, at being slicker than the first.  The Prom scene is replaced with a party scene this time around and it just doesn't hold up.  There is certainly more gore this time around, and the prank is pretty nasty, but it lacks that gothic terror that the first one (with much cheaper effects, I might add) created.Fans of the first film might find this interesting, if only from a clinical standpoint.  Don't expect much this time around.  The Rage Carrie 2 is disappointing follow up, simply because it tries too hard to be different.

In the original Carrie, the novel by Stephen King, Carrie's father, Ralph White, was killed at work when Momma was first pregnant with Carrietta.  That aside, during the scene where they show the old school, in the blaze that occured, there was not a lot left. Also, again in the novel, the building was razed.

Not being a fan of the horror genre, I expected to strongly dislike the film. However, I actually hated this picture. A good horror movie is one that is scares the viewer by using mental techniques...eerie music, creepy lighting, a well-placed crash. Take the classic film Halloween for example. There's hardly any blood or gore in that film, yet it's terrifying. Carrie 2, on the other hand, failed to use any mental scare tactics...instead the movie relied on gore to make its point. I found this movie disgusting and just plain gross. Dialogue is also key for a successful movie. The movie Scream, while a tad gory, has a great script that is both humorous and witty. The script of Carrie 2, however, is dry and unoriginal. Its portrayal of teenagers is sadly off the mark, and characters are not realistic. Carrie 2 does have a few strong points, though. The acting by Emily Bergl is impressive, seeing what she was given to work with. With a better script, Bergl has definite potential as a top teen actress. The movie's storyline is interesting for a while...it weakens considerably after Rachel's friend commits suicide and Amy Irving is brought in as the school guidance counselor. Irving gives a horrible performance, and her scenes bring the film down even further. Technically speaking, the special effects are impressive, as are the sound effects. The flashbacks to Carrie are a mistake...not only do they confuse the audience members who have not seen the original, but they make Carrie 2 look even worse in comparison. In general, Carrie 2 is a bad movie that I do not recommend...with the exceptions of Bergl (London wasn't half bad either), the special effects, and the sound effects, the whole film is a laughable parody of what a good movie should be.

This movie should have been independent from the first Carrie, and just be considered a movie, and not a sequel. The main character is instead a girl named Sue (Amy Irving). Though Irving was the best actor in the movie, she was not even comparable to Sissy Spacek, who played Carrie White.  I think that a bunch of rich film-makers sat around a table and talked about how much money movies like Scream and The Faculty were making, and therefore decided to make a few million easy dollars by destroying a classic. It's simple---  If you like movies that are low quality and are filled with appealing young actors who lack talent, then go see this Easy-money flick. If you like quality horror films, or don't believe in mutilating a classic for the sole purpose of film-makers to get rich---- stick to the orginal.

Jock Jesse is sincere in his befriending of freaky Rachel, but his friends want nothing more than to make a fool of her.Twenty years ago, after having been taunted and teased by the popular kids, Carrie White and her wrath destroyed Bates high school and the many teens trapped inside of it at the prom.  There was one survivor of that ill-fated night.  Sue Snell (Amy Irving) now serves as guidance counselor, trying to save all the lost teenage souls at Bates.  Rachel may very well be one of those souls.  Carrie White's half sister, Rachel lives with a less than loving foster family and is only slightly aware of the fact that she has the power to move objects with her mind.  To anyone familiar with Carrie, the scenario is easy to predict.  Rachel is befriended by hunky jock Jesse (Jason London) much to the disapproval of his clique of friends.  Jesse is sincere, but his friends vow to make a fool out of Rachel.  Only, they have no idea who they are messing with.Utterly a misuse of film budgets, talent and time, The Rage Carrie 2 leaves much to be desired.  How Amy Irving ever agreed to this, one may never know. Scenes are taken from the original Carrie and in the end are nothing but offensive to the classic directed by Brian De Palma.  (Sissy Spacek received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the telekinetic confused teen, and horror films rarely get noticed by the Academy.  That goes to the quality of the original.)  The writing is weak, holes are left in the plot, but one can conclude from this sequel that Ralph White, father to both Carrie and Rachel, must have had a penchant for religious zealots with wild, curly brown hair.

My brother saw it in theaters when I was seven, and told my mother it was terrible. When I fell in love with Carrie, I told my friend I wondered how the sequel was. She had also seen it and said it was terrible.They were right.Carrie 2 had potential. The character of Emily Bergl's Rachel Lang is a very intriguing idea, as she is a bit of a punk rocker, in contrast to Carrie's shy demeanor, but her personality is underdeveloped, squashed underneath the all too many attempts to maintain the point THIS IS THE NEW CARRIE, SHE CAN MOVE THINGS WITH HER MIND! Watch her break this snow-globe, close this locker, break this window, JUST WITH HER MIND!!!! Amy Irving returns as Susan Snell, but pay CLOSE attention, or you won't be able to know that, as she's only mentioned by name perhaps two times. She attempts to help Rachel in a horrible remake of the Carrie-Ms. Collins relationship, and even goes so far as to visit Rachel's mother in Arkham Asylum (stolen from Batman) and find out she's Carrie's half sister but Rachel won't take it and ends up killing her with a fire poker. I feel sorry for Sue. Why would you live twenty-three years after the plight of Carrie only to get killed by her not as interesting, horrible protagonist younger sister? But the one thing I will give this film is a kudos to its love story, even though IT has its flaws. Rachel's boyfriend, Jesse Ryan, is a jock who rejects his former friends for Rachel's sake, but isn't smart enough to realize after one of them invites him to take Rachel to his summer house that something is suspicious. The jocks turn out to be planning Rachel's humiliation, because she wants to give the police evidence they caused her friend's death. Rachel says she does not believe in love, but after two dates, sleeps with Jesse and later tells him she loves him as a house burns around them? Okay, whatever.In the inevitable destructive ending, Rachel's tattoo extends around her flesh... which is a great special effect, but how does it pertain to the story? She has telekinesis, not magic powers. Even her death is questionable, a piece of roof falls on her and crushes her? Why would a telekinetic person die from something falling on top of them? MOVE IT!!!! When sequels do not star the original character, they have to be REALLY GOOD to make it. The Rage Carrie 2 does not do this. It is a half-baked remake for the nineties, and if I want a half-baked remake, I will WATCH the remake from 2002. The one star given is for the flashbacks of Carrie, and I am proud to say it.

Carrie was made into a movie in 1976 and was a major breakthrough being the first real modern horror film with teenagers. It had great special effects, terrific actors and was absolutely scary! Over 2 decades later came The Rage Carrie 2, the sequel. Sad if you really think about it as Carrie is a great horror movie that you were glad wasn't tarnished by the stream of sequels like most slasher movies. But I figured it's not a totally bad idea to keep the story alive as bullies and those they pick on will never go away. In fact as the years go on, it seems bullying gets worse and worse, so The Rage seemed like it could be a good fit into what's going on in today's schools with Columbine and other school shootings.Rachel talks with her friend Lisa, who has lost her virginity to Eric, a football player. The football players talk about Lisa; they have a game where they sleep with girls and receive points. After Eric rejects her, Lisa commits suicide, jumping from the school's roof. The event triggers Rachel's ability, causing the lockers in the school to open. School counselor Sue Snell talks with Rachel about Lisa. The discussion upsets Rachel and one of Sue's mugs crashes to the floor. Sue visits Rachel's mother, learning that Rachel and Carrie share the same father. Later on, one of the jocks, Jesse, takes a liking to Rachel, but due to his friends, they might tap into something that Rachel can't control and leads to one hell of a party.The Rage isn't actually a bad movie, it is a terrific update on this terrifying story. However, I was really displeased with the make up effects. The whole thing with the veins was scary to me and didn't add any effect. Emily Bergl did a good job playing Rachel, you felt her alienation from her classmates but that she also didn't mind being different. I liked that she denied her powers, that maybe it's a trick of her mind. But the love story between her and Jason London didn't work for me, not because of the chemistry which I didn't feel, but because they are supposed to be young teenagers and how they fall in love and so quickly was unbelievable. At least just leave the love part out of it, it would have been fine. I would say that The Rage is a harmless horror movie, it's enjoyable over all with some cool kills. The effects aren't too over the top and work, it's just a flawed film like most horror sequels. It just couldn't hold a candle up to the original, but that's OK, I don't know if we would even want it that way.5/10 "}{"Title":"Some parts were good, but I was disappointed","Date":"18 July 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" I don't like scary movies, and the only reason I would have watched this was the fact it was filmed near where I live.

Oh yeah, Rachel is the sister of Carrie, but of course she didn't know that either...All in all this isn't more but a teen slasher movie that tries to get some extra attention by using the name of a classic in the genre. It isn't worth much and therefor I give it a 5/10.

You might get a person or two who will say that the acting had its good points or that other factors involved in production were satisfactory. And they might even be correct in their opinion. That still does not exclude this movie from being a huge turkey. And by 'turkey' I mean the evil kind. There are good 'turkeys' such as 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Movies like that are forgivable. This is something else entirely. This movie was made to generate money. A casual eye wont care much, but Im sure this movie will tick off the serious film buff. Especially if they liked the 1976 'Carrie'. So whats this carrie2 all about? (Im gonna bazooka the spoilers here so duck if you dont want to know) The lead character, Rachel, is a high school student with telekinesis and few friends, just like the first movie, it's remake and the novel they was based on. She lives with foster parents because her mother is in a mental facility. As it turns out, her mother did the horizontal mambo with Carrie's biological father making the two sisters. Never mind the fact that Rachel's father would have been in his 60s and her mother in her 20s at the time of her birth and that Rachel's mom's religious nature would have made such a union all the more improbable. The film trudges on to a plot concerning high school jock-types trying to have sex with as many girls as they can so they can display the results later. Now call me silly, but I seem to recall high school always being like that to some extent. For that reason its hard to see the Rachel character as much of a victim. Unlike her 'sister', she has friends and a job and seems to be doing ok. You know whats going to happen next, somethings going to trigger Rachel's telekinesis, she's going to be at odds with the jocks, one of them is going to be the good guy she falls for, and then we have the finale where people die. Thats it. I forgot to mention that Amy Irving is in this. Supposedly she is reprising her role as Sue Snell, but she's only there to be the 'chalk-board' explanation person for Rachel. Never mind how A regular person would know the exact science of telekinetic biology. Never mind that this version of Sue Snell gets a quick death near the end anyway. Never mind that the first movie used Brian DePalma's craft work for some very effective scenes and this version uses a stretchy lens to replace him. never mind any of that stuff, because it does not matter. The studio already has your money. Now if your smart you will realize what is going on here. It isnt so much the story or the acting or anything else that makes this an 'evil' turkey. Its the intentions behind it. Now lets say intentions were good. Well, guess what? It still bombs because the movie also succeeds at making you feel creepy. Not 'good' creepy but that irritating creepy you felt back in high school, the feeling that made you wish you had telekinesis so you could wipe out some cheerleaders yourself. If you liked the original Carrie, you know why you liked it the split screen, the dark cinematography that made Carrie's house look so lonely, the well written music that uses sympathy to evoke horror, the little touches like the ominous hornet logo used for the high school, the ultra good acting, etc. You wont find that here.

However, after having viewed the other comments expressed and finding that 85% of them were very positive (a clear indication of brain damage), I think that it's my duty as a public service to give a revue. If for no other reason, than to help make clear to those poor misguided comment writters what a grave error they have made.The craft of film work can be very ironic and moronic, and it seems that we never learn, only to repeat the same pattern. Why? Well, money is usually the main and most cliche motive, but other reasons include a large production staff (too many cooks) and current social factors (what's considered 'in'in a movie).Now, having said that, let's take a look at what went wrong. First and foremost there was never a good reason for a sequel. Carrie was a masterwork. Even if you did not like the movie, the acting, music, cinematography, and direction all stand well on their own. Brian DePalma has been criticized for copying Hitchcock. I do not believe that to be the case, DePalma took Hitchcock's influence and created on top of that. Pino Donaggio's score is wonderful in composition and it's unique ability to deliver emotional impact. Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, et all, delivered excellent performances that gave dimension to their characters. That was 1976, and the movie cost 1 million dollars to make. 24 years and 20 million dollors later we get 'The Rage Carrie2'. The character of Carrie White is not even a part of the movie, yet we get the obligatory 'Carrie2' because studios figure that audiences are morons that will not recognize a sequel unless it has a name tie-in. The intro to the movie is bland with no build up to the title as in the first movie, an indication of a bad product right from the start.This takes us to the characters and main plot. We have the lead character, who has Marilyn Manson posters on her walls and dresses accordingly (like you would imagine an average high schooler of the time to look like) and has a small group of friends, yet the jocks and the cheerleaders don't like her. Sounds great to me! But for some reason this is considered a loss. Then we have the cheerleaders and jocks. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make these people so unlikeable that it crosses the boundries of entertainment and makes you want smack them around for real yourself. The jock characters ooze testosterone infused male cliches, and the cheerleaders just come off as complainers. In Carrie, the title's namesake was a complete outcast with an obviously long history of peer mistreatment. In this flick we get a girl who has freinds and who's only torment is a set of stereotype grouchy adoptive parents. It is hard to picture a tragedy around a person who seems strong enough to handle it, and the movie suffers heavily from this. We then have the jock turned good guy, the religous fanatic mother (hmmmm, sounds familiar) who's only lines of dialog include poorly placed Bible quotations, and finally the Sue Snell character from the original movie. Why Amy Irving, a great actress, agreed to do this is beyond me. And her character is treated with great disinterest, using her only as a link to the original film.And the plot... Possibly the worst part, is almost a complete retread of 'Carrie'. It's almost as if someone in an office said, 'it's been 20 some years since the original, which has gained a cult following, it's time to make a follow up!' And so, the writters went working, for about 30 minutes. This is the story The jocks have a sinister plot! They (GASP) have sex with other girls in school. Now I don't approve of that, but it's hardly anything new or all that sinister. Wrong, but not a master plan. The good guy jock is egged on to do a few things with the lead character. But since he's the good guy, he falls in love with her. The cheerleaders hate this (it's only one guy!) spraypaint his car, videotape him, then proceed to do something to the girl. The girl, of course has telekinisis, which is actually explained away as a genetic trait given to her by her father... Carrie's father! ok, so that would have made him around 55 when he conceved another kid with a woman that would have to have been in her late twenties. But if that's the case, who is the voice that keeps talking to the girl, moving windows around? And then we have a tatoo that gets bigger when one gets angrier, and a new improved telekinetic 'flex' sound. I think we all know where this is going, and you probably already guessed the ending. To proove that this film has no heart, they quickly kill Sue Snell toward the end without any reason. They even go as far as to re-do a 'shock' finale like the original film.It's that bad folks. THIS is what Hollywood thinks about your favorite films and also how they feel about entertaining you once they have secured you money. You have been warned.

Often, when a great film is made, a sequel is inevitable--for financial reasons if for nothing else. And every once in a while, a sequel will be so dispiritingly awful, so hellbent on destroying everything that worked so well about the original, that we feel compelled to ignore it and assume that the story ended with Part 1. Staying Alive...Exorcist 2 The Heretic...Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby...and now The Rage Carrie 2. Yes, it seems that even after 23 years, no film is safe. Let's see--how to explain what went wrong? Well, imagine Carrie with all the  emotional elements excised and the material updated for yammering, self-referential mallrats. Yes, it's that bad. Excuse me while I fire off mistakes at random. This film cost a needless $21 million (compared to the original's modest but well-utilized $1.8 million), and the money was apparently used in the hiring of talent-dry teenybopper marquee value; they might as well have stuffed the cash down the garbage disposal--the result would've been the same. Amy Irving is wasted; she is here to establish a link with the first film, and she is cruelly discarded after serving that purpose. Emily Bergl obviously has talent, but she can't do much with the material she's given. And what material! This time, the emphasis is not on emotional pain, but on sappy teen romance and dialogue more suited to the WB network. Elements from the original (frizzy-haired fanatic momma) and new (again, updated) ideas are tossed together, and the result is a mangled mess. Carrie worked so well because the title character was so odd, desperate, tortured. Here, the lead is all too functional and aware. So why does she go to the party? Why does she accept their apologies (and so readily)? I was a tormented 16-year-old when this movie came out, so this lapse in logic really struck me. Of course, since this is a sequel to Carrie, the girl is telekinetic. The movie even botches this. In Carrie, the extrasensory elements were an extension of her emotions; here, they are far more gratuitous. For the final holocaust, the gore is of a more extreme nature, but they can't even do THAT right! This time, they use computer generation. I am not scared of an expensive cartoon. I have no earthly clue why they insist on using computer generation when the same effects could be accomplished much more convincingly and economically with a little piano wire and a few gallons of stage blood. What else is wrong? Everything, truthfully. Someone's bizarre idea of visual flair is switching between color and black-and-white and stretching the picture. The music is routine. The plot is needlessly convoluted (I know it's based on a true story--that doesn't make it effective). In short, please do yourself a favor and stick with the original. Just ignore The Rage. Let Carrie White rest in peace. "},{"Title":"Not a terrible movie.

Like in the first Carrie, Rachel is a about to go to her prom, not knowing what kind of horrible trick the kids at her school have planned to humiliate her. But, with Rachels powers, she will have the last laugh and the prom will be one no-one will forget, if any of them survive of course, which doesn't look likely with Rachel and her powers there.  Newcomer Emily Bergl plays the lead role of Rachel here and she's quite good. Amy Irving is back here playing Sue Snell of course, and she's great.Considering Carrie is such a great movie, and was fine with just having one made, there was no need for a sequel. Which is of course why the movie flopped.

The Rage Carrie 2 features a very nice performance from the lead Emily Bergyl and unlike most movies in the teen dice and slice genre, Carrie 2 manufactures a bit of space, some wistfulness around the characters.For heaven's sake Billie Holiday even makes it prominently onto the soundtrack.Many reviewers seem to have found the pace of Carrie 2 two slow, but they mustn't be fans of Billie Holiday. This is a horror movie for the (very slightly) more thoughtful viewer.The original Carrie is a classic, said by many to be Brian de Palma's best film. It earned a couple of Academy Award nominations, for Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, and had monumentally effective pivotal scenes.It created a genre of its own. Viewers who haven't seen Carrie will need little prompting to understand what is going on in this openly derivative sequel. And they won't have to be told what is going to happen. Carrie 2 makes no attempt to break new ground and Carrie One invented the rules.	A young girl (Sissy Spacek) is the dowdy one at school in the 1967 movie. Her school mates taunt her and horribly humiliate her at the prom, but little do they know that Carrie White is powerfully telekinetic. She slams the doors shut and massacres them.	De Palma and Spacek gave young Carrie a great deal of dignity and the audience understood the pain within this young person when she took her terrible revenge. That De Palma managed to promote strong reactions more often by the use of subtle hints, rather than the blood covered bludgeon favoured by less able directors, was a testament to his superb directing skills.	And it is late in the Carrie 2, when the massacre scene begins and the blood begins to flow, that the magic is lost. This is the nineties, and I suppose that the kids won't go unless there's excessive violence, but the movie would have worked far better if the murders could have been less noisy perhaps, or if Rachel had even let them go.	I loved the growing tattoo though and eventually had the biggest jump from fright for ages. Long live horror films!

The most popular boy in school asks Rachel out and really begins to fall for her even though his friends think that he is just playing game with her.Rachel tries to make trouble for Jesse who drove her friend to suicide and the football team reacts by trying to suck up to her so that they can invite her to a party and humiliate her. We know what happens next, the blood and guts climax with the kids screaming and trying to get away as objects fly through the air and land mostly in their heads (those that aren't lopped off anyway). But that isn't the dumbest scene in the movie. That gem goes to a completely pointless scene in which Irving takes Rachel out to the sight of the old high school and it's still a pile of burnt rubble.The movie has its merits. Emily Bergl is a very relaxed actress who stays focused on the moment. I looked at her several times during the movie when another character was talking; she wasn't reacting, she was listening. I hope to see her in a much better movie because I think she has real talent.I could imagine pieces of this story working without the guise of a 'Carrie' sequel. I can imagine the story of a girl dealing with the fact that a cruel betting pool among jocks drove her friend to suicide. I can imagine how the movie would deal with her friend trying to make some sense of all of it. I could imagine how a sensitive jock would start to have feelings for her despite his friend's objections. Just clear out the clutter in this movie's screenplay and you have a decent movie.I shouldn't think so much in a movie like this but a movie this routine gives me a lot of time to do that.

This trashy sequel does have Katt Shea directing (who did fairly good work with Poison Ivy), but gives her nothing to work with. It actually has the gall to try and connect the two films (here, Emily Bergl plays Carrie's half-sister!). Of course she is taunted and humiliated, and of course she pulls out all the stops. Lousy production, poor editing and--most especially--bad writing leaves Shea and an adequate cast eating dust. * from **** "},{"Title":"What Was the Point?","Date":"16 April 2015","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" The Rage Carrie 2 (1999)** (out of 4) After the suicide of her best friend, Rachel Lang (Emily Bergl) realizes that it was due to some football players playing a game where they sleep with girl they see beneath them in order to get points. Around this time councilar Sue Snell (Amy Irving) begins to see something in Rachel that she saw years earlier in Carrie White. Soon Rachel has a star football player (Jason London) after her but another group has other plans for her.THE RAGE CARRIE 2 is a rather confusing film on many levels. The obvious thing is why was a sequel even needed to the Brian DePalma masterpiece? This film is the perfect example of why I always say remakes are a lot more original than sequels because this thing here has very little connection to the original movie and what's here is downright stupid on many logical areas. This so-called sequel is basically just a poor rehash of all of the events in the film film, which is really too bad because so much more could have been done with this thing but sadly we're left with an incredibly dull and rather lifeless horror film.What made CARRIE so wonderful is that it was basically a teenage drama with some very strong horror elements. There's really no drama going on with this film because the screenplay just has one cliché after another and what's worse is that so much of it is boring or just unbelievable. Not for a second was the game being played by the football players something interesting or evil enough to where you get drawn into the story. What's even sillier is the Rachel character and her powers that really don't come out until the end. You never really feel too bad for her character but then again the film doesn't try to make you even like her. What's worse is the Sue Snell character, which is only here so that they can call this CARRIE 2.The performances are a mixed bag as well, although I will say, for the most part, that everyone is good enough considering what type of film this is. I thought Bergl was effective in the lead role but, to be honest, she really doesn't have too much to work with or do. Irving fits into her role nicely, although it's certainly poorly written. Jason London gives the basic Jason London performance for whatever that's worth.Fans of the original CARRIE were letdown because there really wasn't much of a connection. Fans of horror films from this era didn't get the connection to the original. In the end, both sets of fans lost as THE RAGE CARRIE 2 is just an all around disappointment. The film certainly isn't horrible but when you try to follow up a masterpiece you better be something more than what's offered here. "},{"Title":"Final 20 minutes is powerful! The rest is simply mediocre","Date":"19 February 2015","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Rachel Lang is a teenager with many emotional troubles. Her Mom is a little crazy and she's ridden with telekinesis, meaning she has the uncanny ability to move things with her mind. Sue Snell (Amy Irving) witnessed the downfall of Carrie White many years ago, and wants to make sure that Rachel doesn't go through the same thing. To make matters worse, her best friend Lisa (Mena Suvari) commits suicide over a womanizer, leaving her with nothing. Things start to look up when she meets a hunk at the school (Jason London) and Rachel uncovers what happened to cause her best friend to commit suicide, but wannabe jock, Eric (Zachary Ty Bryan) will stop at nothing to make sure Rachel doesn't uncover the truth. I'm NOT a fan of the first movie or the remake. The first movie has a huge following, something I've never quite understood. It's an above average movie at best. Needless to say, my expectations for this unnecessary sequel were quite low. The original is mentioned here and there, but so much more could have been done with it. The relationships feel very cookie-cutter and forced. It's hard to commit emotionally when I felt so empty for most of the duration. The character development isn't that great, and everything felt thrown in there. The telekinesis storyline is played out as well. Emily Bergl is great as Rachel, managing to overcome a poor script. I don't get why she was such an outsider, though. She's really pretty! I had a hard time believing that she had trouble gaining friends or dates. She makes the most of it, and comes through like a champ. Jason London is solid as the love interest. Chicks will fall in love with him, and he's really likable. His chemistry with Bergl is decent, albeit unspectacular. Amy Irving cashes in a check, I'll say that. Her part wasn't much, and had the potential to be much more. Zachery Ty Bryan is a lame jock. He's rather boring, in my opinion. For those that don't know, he's mostly known for Home Improvement. Rachel Blanchard is sexy and manipulative, giving her thin part some flavor. I've been a fan of hers since Clueless. American Pie fans will rejoice at the sightings of Mena Suvari and Eddie Kaye Thomas! I know I did. Too bad their parts aren't much. A lot of the characters are unsympathetic, making it hard to care about their fates. I wouldn't call this a gore fest, but the ending is absolutely LOADED with blood! If you've seen the ending to Hellraiser 3, you'll see something very similar here. It gets really nasty! Fun with CD's, glass, spears, and much more! They try to recreate the emotional impact from the ending of the first one to no avail.The last 20 minutes are fun! Shame about the rest of it. It's watchable, but completely uninspired in every way. If you insist on seeing it, prepare for a lot of routine drivel until the last 20 minutes! The best thing about this movie is Emily Bergl's performance. 5.1/10 "},{"Title":"Just making cheap cash off the 1976 Carrie","Date":"2 November 2014","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" It's bad enough that Carrie had its awful remakes in 2002 and 2013, but if you look at all four Carrie movies, you'll discover one of the worst movies ever. Just like the Firestarter sequel (Rekindled), this one travels way too far from the original plot, the characters are preppy high school students and the soundtrack is horrible, as is the acting.The Rage follows telekinetic outcast and killer Carrie White's half-sister, Racheal, as she discovers her own horrible powers. As a child her mom was committed to a mental hospital so now Racheal lives with her trailer-trash foster parents and her only friend has committed suicide, leaving her alone. Racheal's beloved basset hound, Walter, is squashed by a car, and afterwards Racheal begins to learn that the urban legend of Carrie White, who wrecked the town in the Seventies, was indeed a true story, and soon everyone at school is coming face-to-face with Racheal's telekinetic rage.There are so many cliché horror elements in this movie that it's not even funny. I cared nothing about what happened to any of the characters, the guys were all sleazy sex maniacs and the girls were all snotty Barbie clones or emo teens, nothing unique about anyone. For some reason Racheal has a heart-shaped tattoo, no idea why, and when she uses her powers, vines grow out of it. Why? Like I said, no idea whatsoever, just a pointless waste of the movie's budget.The only bright side to this pathetic load of garbage is that Amy Irving, who played the original Sue Snell in the 1976 Carrie, comes back to play the role of Sue Snell again as an adult. This movie reminded me more of The Haunting of Molly Hartley than it did of Carrie.My advice? Don't watch The Rage unless you're incredibly bored.

The obvious question, then WHY? Why bother? What's the point of it all? I don't even like Brian De Palma's 'Carrie', an overrated adaptation of Stephen King's first novel, but jeez. This is just a cash grab that plods predictably through the plot of the first movie.In classic 'Teen Wolf Too' style, the movie introduces us to Rachel (Emily Bergl), a handy long-lost sister of Carrie's who has the same (apparently hereditary) mental abilities. She's an outsider, the high school elite torments her, she takes telekinetic revenge. That's pretty much it apart from an entirely unconvincing romance between Rachel and kind-hearted jock Jesse, played by Jason London with all the presence and charisma of a year-old pie. There's a void at the centre of the film where their relationship should be because the movie offers not a single scene to explain their attraction.One of the few things the movie has going for it is Bergl, whose smile lights up both her face and the screen, and who is able to infuse her underwritten character with an extra dimension, something none of the other actors manages. The trick played on her by the jocks is painful to watch because she's engendered some sympathy, and this cruelty (and their list of conquests) is the only time the movie breaks itself out of its apathetic shuffle. Even so, it's all been done before.Other than the entire plot, the other strand connecting this to the original is the reappearance of Amy Irving's Sue Snell, now, by some coincidence, a counsellor at the school. She sees the signs and tries to help Rachel, but there's very little reason for her to be there she barely connects with the plot aside from supplying the clunky scenes that explain Rachel's parentage, and she gets an entirely dignity-free end into the bargain. (I hooted at the scene where she takes Rachel to see the ruins of the high school &#x96; still there after 20 years!)Throw in a 'shock' ending and the obligatory genre in-jokes (damn you, 'Scream') and that's your lot. Run of the mill rather than outright bad, 'The Rage Carrie 2' is completely, utterly and totally re-frickin-dundant.

While the special effects were really good, you may very quickly experience a sense of deja vu as the film goes along, like the original story, this supposed sequel has a young girl named RACHEL being taunted, teased & humiliated by those dumb mean spirited high school kids & her home life ain't all that miraculous either. At a party which occurs at the climax, RACHEL is humiliated yet again by these kids in an even more embarrassing fashion, as they play a video cassette of Rachel & her boyfriend making love & well that's the last straw! Rachel you see is the half sister to Carrie, the other tortured & telekinetic challenged girl from the original & just like Carrie, she decides to get even with these dumb clearsil heads by wiping them out in gruesome & very violent fashion & she definitely does not show any mercy! While the actors all performed well in their roles & were all very talented, their characters on the other hand were far from likable, coming off as annoying jerks that we actually are glad to see them get their just desserts & although Director KATT SHEA does well behind the camera, she as well as the script writers seemed to be to afraid to shy away from the first film, many scenes are much to reminiscent of the earlier film & nothing truly spectacular happens in the movie to make it memorable or even worth a rent until the climax, I mean this is far from being a bad movie, but it also is not very entertaining either, it just sort of falls in between the chairs.

Smith-Cameron) of a young girl with telekinesis named Rachael (Kayla Campbell) being taken away by paramedics to rot in in insane asylum. Jump forward several years later & Rachael (Emily Bergl) is now a freaky looking goth wannabe teenage high school student who all the popular kids think is a skank & to add to her worries she only has one friend, Lisa Parker (Mena Suvari). If that wasn't enough one of the football jocks Eric Stark (Zachery Ty Bryan) dumps Lisa in a rather unfriendly way, Lisa is devastated & commits suicide by jumping off the school roof. Eric & the other lads seem more concerned about the damage to the car Lisa landed on while Rachael is understandably gutted, as Rachael begins to discover the cruel joke played on Lisa & herself by her fellow students she delivers her own unique violent brand of revenge as she goes into a rage...Directed by Katt Shea, who also has a small role in the film as an assistant D.A., I thought The Rage Carrie 2 was a pretty awful film. The original Carrie (1976) is a brilliant horror/thriller & my IMDb comment exists to prove that I think that but this supposed sequel fails in almost every respect in which the original was so good. The script by Rafael Moreu is slow, it has the most clichéd & unlikable character's imaginable, it's wholly predictable, there's no subtlety & there is virtually zero build up or development unlike the original. The dialogue was bad, the character's didn't work & I really fail to see why Lisa & Rachael were treated as outcasts as I thought they were both very attractive & seemed pretty 'normal', the whole concept of Rachael as an outsider & social misfit just didn't work as she comes across as far too normal. One of the reasons why the original was such a good & powerful film was of Carrie & the fantastic & utterly believable Oscar nominated performance by Sissy Spacek, can the same be said about Bergl? She ain't getting anywhere near an Oscar unless she steals one! Unfortunately the central character & how you feel towards them is essential for the film to work so when it's messed up as badly as it is here the film suffers. For most of it's dull running time The Rage Carrie 2 plays like a teen drama with the boring romance between Rachael & Jesse (Jason London) dominating things, it's not until the bland climax that Rachael uses her powers to any entertaining effect.Director Shea does nothing, her idea of style is to shake the camera a bit, insert a few black & white shots & have a stupid sound effect when Rachael uses her powers, yuk. It has none of the elegant class of the original. The scene at the end when Rachael's tattoo starts to grow & cover her body is meaningless & looks terrible. The climax is basically the same as the original with Rachael using her powers to take revenge on her tormentors, at least there's some blood during this bit. A couple of people are impaled on pokers, someones glasses shatter which make their eyes explode, someone has a spear shot through his groin & in a hilarious bit someone is attacked by a plastic pool cover which knocks him out!I was simply amazed to learn that The Rage Carrie 2 had a supposed budget of about $21,000,000, where did all the money go? That seems like an awful lot of money, there's no big name stars, no special effects until the end, no exotic locations, no stunts or action scenes & it's set almost entirely in the same place. It's generally well made but then for that sort of money that's the minimum requirement. The acting was pretty bad with Amy Irving the only returning original cast member.The Rage Carrie 2 is an awful film that doesn't deserve to feed off the reputation of the original, this is definitely a sanitised bottle-less version of Carrie for the teenage masses. In my opinion apart from a few half decent deaths at the end The Rage Carrie 2 sucks, it's as simple & straight forward as that. "}]
