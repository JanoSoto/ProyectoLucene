This was a good movie. There was a sadistic violence, a bunch of sex scenes, vulgarity, more graphic violence, more sex, a three way, and an incredibly sad, tragic ending.If you are able to look past all this (many people cannot, mind you), than you will see a good movie about three teenage tortured souls cruising along the urban pits of Los Angeles, who run into a crazy clerk with a shotgun, a crazy drive thru attendant with a shotgun, a nasty blonde with a sword, and some really scary Neo Nazis, who all think Amy Blue is someone else.Rose McGowen is Amy Blue, the sexy, angry, speed taking, tough as nails lead character, James Duval is Amy's naive, stoner boyfriend Jordan White, and Johnathon Schaech was Xavier Red, the crazy, dangerous, kinky, and violent source of trouble. If you have a strong stomach, and don't mind harshly sad endings, check it out, but be aware, because you might get grossed out and leave (I almost did). 9/10   "},{"Title":"a very weird film that definitely isn't for all tastes","Date":"11 January 2000","Score":"34 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  (my comments are based on the uncensored 85 min. director's cut. stay away from the butchered 72 min. cut R-rated version)everytime i have seen this movie i always have the same reaction.

It's also a lot of fun, in an ironically kitsch, acquired-taste sort of way.At the time of its 1995 release The Doom Generation was firmly entrenched as part of the 'new queer cinema' (a movement which sought to break down notions of 'normal' heterosexuality through transgression and subversion rather than through polemic statements). The film sets out to explore a sexual dynamic that lies well outside the traditional boy-meets-girl (or even boy-meets-boy) structure of 99% of American movies, but it does do with its tongue firmly planted in (between) cheek(s).The plot is extraordinarily simple. Teen couple Amy White (Rose McGowan, best known as small screen witch Paige Matthews from Charmed) and Jordan White (James Duval, more recently seen as Frank in cult film Donnie Darko) accidentally save the seductive, psychotic bisexual Xavier Red (Jonathon Schaech) from a violent gang of homophobes (played by members of industrial band Skinny Puppy) before throwing him out of their car a short time later. The trio meets again later that night at the scene of an accidental convenience store murder, forcing them into an uncomfortable intimacy as they flee the scene of the crime. Before long this intimacy develops significantly, in scenes which display a truly erotic frisson.The film is deliberately trashy, satirizing western culture's love of consumption and surface beauty while simultaneously commenting on the homophobia underlying traditional macho braggadocio. It's also influenced by such classic genres as the road movie and the horror film, in particular taking the horror movie's obsession with bodily penetration and perverse sexuality (as typified by the likes of Alien and The Fly) to occasionally shocking extremes.With its garish, adolescent energy and deft ear for teen culture's dialog and self-obsessed behavior, not to mention a too-cool-for-school soundtrack of mid-90's alternative bands (as well as a cameo by Janes's Addiction's Perry Farrell among others), Gregg Araki's The Doom Generation is an occasionally infuriating but wildly entertaining sex-murder romp whose ending is all the more powerful for the light tone the film has previously employed.RICHARD WATTS "},{"Title":"Welcome on the road to Hell!!

Something that isn't open of discussion is the fact Araki created one of the meanest, most good-looking pieces of trash of the 90's! Imagine yourself a lesser-hyped version of `Natural Born Killers' and exclude that last bit of political correctness. It seems like Araki was testing how far he could go&#133;and then cheerfully exaggerated some more. The Doom Generation is a speed-driven and absurd road movie against all forms of good taste. A young couple, accompanied by a trigger-happy madman, faces the most eccentric situations and deal with the most extravagant characters. The film contains a lot of violence but even more absurd and demoralizing humor, so the whole thing never really becomes disturbing or provocative. Lots of naughty language and nudity, though! Rose McGowan's character Amy is the closest thing to a cult/trash queen we saw in the 90's and her naked body is always a joy to behold. James Duvall (sort of like Araki's lead in his entire teenage-alienation trilogy) is terrific as the confused teenager with the `whatever' attitude! Gregg Araki's visions are downright brilliant from time to time. Many people don't seem to think so (just check the other comments around here) but his film is extremely stylish and a perfect portrayal of a pop culture generation. Heck, even his colorful slang &#150; which includes a whole dictionary of genitalia synonyms &#150; alone is worth the effort. The Doom Generation is one the most special films of the past decade and it really deserves the cult-followings it developed over the years. Check it out if you're open-minded, not quickly offended and not faint of heart!

The film reveals its thematic message when the most innocent and selfless of its three main characters asks the other, more self-centered, two if they ever think about the meaning of existence. Dismissing the very question, they reveal to the questioner an answer of sorts, one which suggests that we each create a meaning for ourselves, and are all existentially alone as we do so.While offering us a rather slight story of a pair of teen lovers on the road who encounter a slightly older bisexual who becomes their nemesis, companion, lover and protector, THE DOOM GENERATION offers a great deal of visual style and wit, and some genuine moments of suspense. In fact, the film's gory and discomforting climactic scene is perhaps the artistic highlight and suggests some real filmaking talent by writer/director Gregg Araki. This is probably not everyone's cup of tea, but is worth a look for those who like a film which challenges them to react to strong imagery and who don't mind transgressive depictions.

Amy Blue and Jordan White are a teenage couple who have been dating a really long time- 3 months. One night Xavier Red jumps in the backseat of Amy's car and leads them on a mad, illicit journey through Greg Arraki's twisted vision of young America. Much has been made of the 'excessive' violence and sex this movie has, but that very excess is part of the point- that pointless excess has led the youth of America down a path where death barely registers, and intimacy doesn't at all. Greg Arraki *likes* these 3 characters. He grieves for the innocence they never even had and the love they try to fashion from the bloody shards of their hearts. And he rages at the widely held and ever-so-patriotic belief that regressing back into intolerance is the answer to America's problems, especially in regards to the young. Maybe he's looking for a third option, one that actually does children good, rather than oppressing them or leaving them to run wild in an irresponsible world. Rose McGowan once stated that Amy, with her sharp tongue and wounded eyes, is Rose herself at 15. Like Amy, Rose suffered a horrible childhood and because she put her fury and pain into her character, any 15-year-old girl who has suffered at the hands of those who are supposed to protect her can relate. Jordan is just adrift. He finds that Amy is having sex with Xavier, and he dismisses it- a soft, honest whatever, Amy. Xavier plays demon-imp, tormenting and tempting Amy and Jordan headlong into their bleak, surreal adventure. Ultimately this story is Amy's, and the story is about isolation- hence Amy's whispered, matter-of-fact assertion at the beginning that there's just no place for us in this world, her attempts to connect with both boys in the only way she knows how, and then her unseeing stare at the end.

With so much sex and violence, you would expect to find something enjoyable in this piece of cinematic flotsam.  But the egregious Gregg Araki has succeeded in making a film about sex and death that is excruciatingly boring.Two of the aforementioned pinheads, played by James Duval and Rose McGowan, pick up a third pinhead on the side of the road.  He is a hitchhiker named Xavier and the film makes it very clear that he is supposed to be cool and sexy.  However, he is really just the same brand-name subculture bad-boy that you can purchase at any Stock-Characters-R-Us Superstore.Anyway, with their trio of stooges complete, our heroes go on a killing spree.  They also stop at a hotel between murders to have sex, breaking up the monotony of the monumentally monotonous story.  They are entangled in a bisexual love triangle, and the film makes it very clear to us that it is all supposed to be very risque and exciting. Er, yeah...I will admit that I didn't finish watching this film.  After the third killing, I realized I had seen all there was to see.  The plot plays very much like a broken record.  First, they stop in a convenience store.  They kill the Asian man that works there.  His severed head lands in the fresh produce, but continues to talk.  How droll.  This scene is supposed to be funny, or shocking, or campy, or something like that.  Actually, it is silly and amateurish, and the talking head is laughable.  They then move on to a variety of other locales to kill a variety of other people.  There is no plot, simply the same scenario repeated.  The violence fails to every really shock the audience, which is a shame, since they could probably use a good jolt to keep them from nodding off.I can forgive a film for having no plot.  The problem is that The Doom Generation fails in all other aspects, as well.  The characters are unbelievable and poorly conceived.  The acting is overwrought.  The cinematography and special effects are of the cable access variety.  The dialogue is positively atrocious.  The script tries to be funny and shocking, but it will induce more groans than chuckles or gasps.It is difficult for me to fully capture in words my contempt for this excremental train-wreck of a film.  It is so transparent about what it wants to be shocking, sexy, and funny, yet witty and satirical at the same time. How far The Doom Generation fell from its lofty goals.Is it sharp social satire?  No.  Is it acerbic dark comedy?  It's not funny. Is it avant garde pulp drama?  I don't think so.  Is it crap?  Bang on!It is very rarely that I fail to finish watching a film.

We watched it in my Film and Video class here, and I loved it.  I seemed to be the exception to the rule, however.  I'd say about 97% of the class disliked to downright hated this movie.  Why did I love it, and everybody else hate it?I loved it because I could see it for what it is.  It was a movie made for high school kids, and it looked and felt like something a high school kid would make.  It was chock full of swearing, sex, violence, and crude humor. There was no plot.  But, it obviously had a budget, and became a satire of itself.  In fact, it could be seen as being a movie that force feeds sex, language, and violence (all the things that high schoolers may think as cool) to kids and shows them that it is not cool.The movie was downright hilarious, and the repetitiveness got hilarious. Everything was run straight to the ground.  And it was all so over the top that you couldn't believe that they actually went as far as they did.The movie, in my opinion, truly grasps the Goth mentality in all of its glory.  Disaffected, removed, and yet sweet in a way, with extremes running through it all.  The one thing that this movie is not is nihilistic though. Somebody referred to it as nihilism for nihilism's sake.  How is this different from the stylistic nihilism of Pulp Fiction?  Not to mention, they did not fully grasp the movie.*SPOILERS SPOILERS* In this movie, they are at first shocked by the death, and show more emotion for the dead characters.  Why do you have to kill someone everytime we stop somewhere?  They feel sad about killing the dog, and give it a burial as well.  The ending is also shock in that, if you even semi-cared for the characters (which should be the nature of film), you felt sad for them, and was shocked by the scariness of the violence and oppression of them.  It had emotions through it about violence, making it not nihilistic.  The ending could also be seen as mourning and dealing, as Amy doesn't reply to the final question.The sex issue was treated with unemotion because sex is seen as detached from love.  Sex is sex.  It is a pleasure.  That's what its seen as in this movie.  It could be heterosexual or homosexual, but it is just sex.  The ending could be seen as the repression of homosexuality by the all-american norm. *END SPOILERS END SPOILERS*So, I say if you can handle ultra violence, and rampant language, and disturbingly close sex, run to the store to see this movie (if they have the unrated version).

The movie is basically taking to task generation X, I mean there is after all a character named X who leads the two other innocent characters down the road to hell. The gratuitous violence is suppose to highlight the characters apathy toward fellow human beings.

And Amy says something to the effect of Life Sucks.Out of all the human death they only show concern for themselves and the effect it will have on them, i.e. getting caught, but they all suffer for the poor dogs death. The sex, voyeurism, partner swapping etc. are just examples of more apathy and general selfishness-if it feels good do it. But your not even sure if it feels good because towards the end when the climax of violence is happening nobody seems overly upset that the sex has taken such a bad turn. Maybe Perry Farrel's earlier cameo is to get you to keep in mind the Jane's addiction lyric ... sex is violence?

(Before I go any further, though, I would like to comment on how funny it is when people write a few hateful sentences about a movie they couldn't understand, only to give it a minor point for nudity before calling that a critique.) Now, a DEFINITE SPOILER ALERT! I am about to explain what I got out of this EXTREMELY ARTISTIC FILM, and why. I myself have not read a lot of Nietzsche, but I am familiar with that hard-to-forget quote of his, that which is God is dead. That may sound blatant, simple, and ridiculous, but I myself have heard different theories on what the meaning behind that quote was. Now to get utterly to the point Jordan WHITE (as in the color of light) is basically Jesus, in a sense. Early on, a hint is given toward the eventual point when there is a shot of Jesus' face in a rear view mirror (as a decoration), with a little skeleton hanging under it. Jordan (played very well by James Duval) is an easy-going, rather pacifistic character who is very non-judgemental of others and seems to love anyone who isn't infinitely evil. He only becomes truly angry during the rape of his girlfriend by the neo-nazis. HIS GIRLFRIEND, not a guy. When he is killed, he is castrated in a Jesus-type pose, his arms held by assailants. I have known people who were into fascism, and I know from that experience that they aren't simply evil, they are evil people who truly believe that they are doing the work of God (at least, in the context shown here). These fascist types try so hard to be good people that they evolve into oppressors who are essentially evil. When the neo-nazis in this film kill the Jesus-like character, they are shown to be killing their own god when they take good intentions and pervert them until all that's left is death and sorrow. This is what I've heard Nietzsche meant by saying, God is dead. I admit this film looks pretty simple and exploitative, but art fans are supposed to be detail-attentive, open-minded, and deep-thinking, and, unless you're all of those, this film won't do anything for you but show you a world of sex and violence. I actually believe that it's highly possible that Gregg Araki was wanting to make sure this was aimed at the right crowd by playing down the deepest and most intellectual elements of this seemingly ditzy splatter film.

While on this trip, they have some encounters with several people who they end up murdering. They don't show any kind of guilt by doing this. Just regret.This film was too easy. It's concluding statement is that the youth of today have made their world there own personal hell. This is established from the beginning and then the film decides to show as many different ways of showing this as it can. For me it didn't work, but in a strange way, it did. I liked the way the film doesn't take or give any sort of apologies for the weird images it shows. I liked the way the film showed us a continuing spiral around repetition. I usually hate it when a film does these sorts of things, but here it fit perfect. Rose Mcgowen does a fine job in her role of what appears to be a girl with terrets syndrome.The major problem is that the film just doesn't show enough of... well... everything. The scenes are half heartedly done, the characters are half heartedly developed, and the set design just seems to keep repeating more and more strange set tone and color, but not enough variety. Take, for instance, a surreal scene in which the teenagers accidentally hit a dog on the road and put it out of its misery. What makes this scene funny is the fact that they have already murdered several people throughout the course of the film, and yet when they hit the dog, they show more genuine emotion for hitting this animal than for murdering another human being. And yet the viewer will still get the feeling that they didn't show enough emotion for the dog either. There must be something wrong with a film when the only scene in the film where the viewer can feel anything relative to the characters in a regular human being is in a particular scene right at the very end which involves hedge trimmers and Nazis. Obviously, it is scenes like the one with the dog that drive the message of the film home.Now, the main problem with the film is how director Greg Araki(Mysterious Skin, Totally F*ckd Up) has to add a little zing to the carnage scenes. He adds style, which should definitely not be used in a film like this. There is a scene where a store owner's head is blown off with a shotgun, right off the stump. Now this scene is pretty straight forwardly done. Two people struggle with the gun, it goes off, someone is killed in the process. The thing is, once the the head lands in the guacamole, it screams and lurches, as if still alive. Now there's nothing wrong with having something like this in a film of this texture. The problem arises when it is talked about on local news programs that begin the discussion of how the head was sworn to be talking at the scene of the crime, and how a necklace was found at the scene of the crime along wit several other dead bodies. This is the kind of stuff that isn't necessary and certainly doesn't make the film any more interesting. It makes the film slow paced. And for a film that is less than 90 minutes, that is something that a director, especially one like Greg Araki, who has made some amazing films, should definitely avoid doing. Just look at films like KIDS or BULLY. They don't fall into the trap of being stylized for the sake of being stylized.Homosexuality also is a frequent concept that is brought up several times in the film. Now i have absolutely nothing against homosexuality in films. I don't even care if it's just a casual occurrence in a film.But in this film, the concept of the boyfriend being gay, or the drifter being gay is simply something that isn't explored to any real extent. In fact, the aspect of Rose Mcgowen or her boyfriend being a straight couple is barely explored either. For a film that has so much gay sex, straight sex, and three ways, there really should be more of an attempt for sexual exploration of the characters and less of a chore. I know that it is just a thing that these characters do, and i know that they don't care who loves who or what they want to do with each other, but they could have at least had an orgy and not just a series of weird encounters.Having said that, i do find the film interesting in its own trashy way. And i do kind of think the film is worth seeing, but the whole awkwardness of what the film attempts and repeatedly succeeds to prove is dumbed down by its finishing touches.(the film is not rated but is intended to be viewed by adults only. it contains overdone violence and gory images, a substantial use of strong language, lots of graphic sex and nudity, and a fair share of drug use.)

While I hate to prattle on about hidden meanings and messages that do not exist or that are not intended, Araki (unlike most film makers) is sophisticated enough to actually put such elements in his films. And he does not strike me as so full of himself that he would do this with no purpose other than mind games. Therefore, I will elaborate on my own interpretation of what he is trying to convey with this film.McGowen's character, Amy Blue seems to be symbolic of the concept of pure beauty, which could be considered our closest relation to a world that exists outside ordinary life. An idea that psychologists like Jung (influenced by Eastern religion) have imagined as involving a sort of collective unconscious that persists through time while actual generations of human beings are born and die. Making beauty our proof while we live that there is something higher than ordinary existence. Like when a composer creates a melody and attributes it to a higher authority because they can't believe themselves capable of bringing something that perfect into the world.Some do not recognize beauty when they see it and some are inspired when they see beauty, but most must possess beauty-or failing to gain possession destroy it rather than share it with others. Protecting beauty from those who would possess it or destroy it is the focus of this film. Although Amy is able to disguise herself from most people (and from most viewers) behind a façade of bad language and grim 'attitude', she is occasionally recognized by those who would possess or destroy-illustrated by the characters that go into violent rapture when they see her.(SPOILERS AHEAD) My guess is that Jordan White is a too pure angel sent to protect Amy, and that Xavier Red is an evolving Jordan as his purity is replaced with protective survival skills. This is why the police agency can only find Amy's fingerprints on file. Like Charlie Kaufman and his twin brother Donald in 'Adaptation', death of one part of the dual identity is necessary for an integration of the two personalities. Akai likes to leave his involved audience members with the feeling that they were dreaming while riding a roller coaster.There are a lot of God-Devil images in this film, with '666' presaging another attempt to destroy beauty or the evidence of 'something higher'.Araki films are often about things not being what they appear to be; and they require the viewer to sort out complexity and revelation in what appear to be one-dimensional characters undergoing no real change. For example the sex scenes in this film, which initially seem crude and graphic, actually have a strange sort of innocence if you get past your own preconceptions.This film is ambitious and amazing but not for everyone.

I stand by this statement very strongly, for this is the third film I have watched by director Greg Araki - The Living End and Nowhere being the others. Araki has made an  offensive, horrendously written (dialogue example Shut up hamburger face!), poorly directed film in The Doom Generation.  It's one of those pictures that knows it's trying to be cool and wants the younger, angst-ridden generation it attempts to portray to buy into such low-rate shock value(Example Each time the characters enter a convenience store, someone is killed.).  Each of the three leads in the film are completely unlikable and poorly acted and they know it - note the terrible over-acting by James Duval.  The word subliminal is something Araki needs to look up as he douses his composition with such over-the-top symbolism - Every time they order something at the convenience store the price comes to $6.66.  Get it?  Ho-hum.  It's enough to make one puke.  Araki has absolutely no respect or passion for his craft and even less for his audience.  In a Premiere magazine interview, when asked what advice he would give to young, aspiring filmmakers he responded, Don't do it.  He acts as if to offend his audience is a chore when it is obvious that he wants so desperately to get a rise out of us with such cheap shock-value.  All of this is offensive, low-rate drivel.  It wants the teen generation to think that they are doomed and to immerse themselves in such fake, melo-dramatic angst.  This is a film that wants to give kids an excuse to shoot their classmates.  It creates problems that never existed in the first place by romanticizing the alienated attitudes of many teens.  This is Araki's only mission in The Doom Generation.  It can be seen just as clear in the aforementioned The Living End and Nowhere.  The film is a mess from start to finish, a total hack job.  Greg Araki is the an entire level below fimmakers like Ed Wood, who at least had passion for the crap he produced.  Hope Araki sleeps well at night.  Or let's hope he stops making films... forever.

What bothers me is I get the sense that the story(?) is secondary to Araki's attempt to have The Doom Generation create the same iconic cultural buzz that Pulp Fiction did the year previous. It's obvious so much time and energy was spent perfecting the crazy/sexy/cool look and feel of the movie, that the story, acting and the (cringe-inducing)dialog were duly sacrificed to achieve some kind of pop culture statement. The problem is that Araki's commentary on the younger generation was so exaggerated and trite it turned me right off and muted any semblance of plot or characterization that remained. Araki comes off like someone who has very little inherit understanding of the generation he's trying to be the mouthpiece for. Xavier licks ejaculate off of his hand, but the only reason why it exists is to 'freak out the hetero squares'. The film bursts at the seams with content that exists only to shock. The trouble is, it has a hard time even doing that.The truly sad thing is, this movie was not without potential. The premise was interesting, the look was good, but if we were given just one more good element, it might have been a watchable film. As it stands, the movie spins its wheels in the mud -- making a lot of commotion, but ultimately never going anywhere. The dialog, I'm convinced, was written solely with the purpose that at least one of the put-downs or sarcastic comebacks would somehow become a popular catchphrase amongst the hip gen-x crowd. Same with the 666 thing. That kind of gimmickry might accentuate a good film, but it also makes a bad film worse, because it comes across as pretentious and self-serving.As a film about the generation of which I'm a member (I was nineteen when this came out), I don't know if I should feel insulted or embarrassed for Araki. One thing's for sure, he should be embarrassed about making this sleazy schlock.

Never before has a film decided to make such a point of self-mocking as this film.  It throws odd and idiotic plot elements, and then the characters mocks them, while the screenplay mocks the characters.  It introduces three strange people, gets them on an odyssey to hell, and then doesn't stop to explain anything.

Then, they go to another store, spend $6.66, and are forced to kill someone else.  This is the plotline.

Let's admit it, even those of you who like the movie only reference the ending, which was the movie's strongest point.Third, the symbolism and metaphors were so obvious, it was retarded. Your average dog could have spotted them.Fourth, just like Natural Born Killers, this movie misses the point. People desensitized to unrealistic violence, either through movies or video games, don't become desensitized to real violence. Although media and parent groups scream otherwise, people who watch violent movies and play violent video games are some of the least violent people in the world. The only people desensitized to real violence are people who are constantly subjected to real violence. Go to the middle east, and you'll see teenagers who are desensitized to violence. For a good movie about desensitization to violence, watch Taxi Driver, or Full Metal Jacket.The true consequence of being desensitized to violence through movies or games, is that we forget what death really is. This doesn't translate into actual violence, just a lack of empathy for real victims, and a general detachment from reality.Fifth, the movie tips its hand with the random, over the top sexuality and ridiculously immature gore. It claims to be a critique of bad exploitation movies, but in reality, it's just another exploitation movie, and not a very good one at that. Take the Asian convenience store scene. No slasher movie would ever put something that stupid in it. By sinking lower than their supposed target, they lost any chance at being considered credible.Sixth, and most importantly, they're psychopathic snobs. The worst case of this is still The Devil's Rejects, but this movie takes a close second. Psychopathic snobbery follows this line of thinking I kill people on a whim, but it's okay because 'fill in the blank'. In Devil's Rejects, it's supposedly okay because they aren't hypocritical, or completely sexually depraved. In Natural Born Killers, it's okay because they were molested as children. Even in the Matrix series, they constantly cause the deaths of innocent people (especially during Neo's flight to save Trinity in the second movie, which had to have killed about a thousand people), but it's okay because they're rebels, and everyone else's life means nothing. In The Doom Generation, they're supposedly desensitized, and they cared about that dog, so it's okay for them to kill on a whim, or so the movie wants us to believe. Psychopathic snobs live by the credo 'It's okay to commit murder, rape and torture, because the victims don't count as real people.' This is actually what gives the ending its power. For in the ending, the tables are turned. Suddenly, they're attacked by other, stronger psychopathic snobs, you believe that the lives of the main characters mean nothing. For the first time, they get to experience what it means to be a victim, and be at the mercy of maniacs who consider them to be less than human. The main characters aren't any better or worse than the Neo Nazis of the ending. They just have different targets for their homicidal whims.Good ending, but not enough to make up for the rest of the movie.

And what better way to end a trilogy than with a threesome in the making? The three protagonists of this production are Jordan White, interpreted by James Duval who once again conveys all the confusion and insecurities of adolescence, Amy Blue, his sexy girlfriend and Xavier Red, a wild, aggressive and assertive guy they meet on the road.Together they will embark upon a journey that, without a clear destination, will bring forth certain aspects of their real 'selves'. At the beginning of the film, Jordan attempts to penetrate his girlfriend to no avail. But this is not a reference to impotence. It is rather a reaffirmation of what Lacan would denominate the nonexistence of sexual rapport. Amy tries to give directions to her insecure boyfriend about what to do with his penis. Obviously, sexual joy here is phallocentric. But let's not forget that the phallus is a signifier, and even the model of jouissance is bound to be seized in the idiocy of the practice that attests to it. A phallocentric perspective exemplifies the non-rapport in the Other.To declare that the jouissance is phallic is fundamentally to state it is solitary. That clearly explains why is it that Jordan and Amy are unable to consummate their passion, remaining as virgins. According to Lacan, the axiom There is no such thing as sexual rapport obeys to a basically solitary jouissance. When Jordan asks Amy Don't you think sex is totally strange? Just the whole idea of it he is essentially explaining how difficult it is to decode sex in the symbolic order, because sex can neither be translated into words nor discarded as simulacra (which happens very often in postmodern society). Amy then responds I think maybe it's more powerful than we'd like it to be. And she is absolutely right about it.As soon as Xavier enters into scene, sexual dynamics are fiercely disrupted. Xavier is sexually overwhelming, he invades the personal space of the boy and the girl, disregarding gender divisions. When Jordan and Amy are taking a shower together, Xavier looks at them and masturbates. Masturbation is very relevant in The Doom Generation, after all, what could best exemplify the solitary jouissance? Amy describes Xavier as a living support for the sexual organ, and Xavier has no problems in acting as a walking penis, so to speak. He is rendered as the phallus, and because he is the phallus he becomes desirable for Amy and Jordan.According to Freud, the man possesses the phallus, for Lacan, however, the woman can also have it (let's remember that phallus is not a synonym for penis). In both cases, as embarrassment, as lack, a substitute to be looked for, yet essentially, sexuality will be there conditioned, determined. To have the phallus is to be afraid of losing it; to not have it is to seek for it. All this is demonstrated when Amy engages in sexual intercourse with Xavier, thus creating a specular moment, an instance which reflects a previous one, in which Jordan masturbates while he sees his girlfriend and his new friend copulating (dynamics that bear some similitude to Cristopher Munch's Harry + Max, so it's not surprising to see this filmmaker credited at the end).Nonetheless, one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the feeling of impending doom that permeates reality over and over again. Amy will summarize it in one phrase there is no place for us in this world; whereas Jordan will only inquire ever felt like reality is more twisted than dreams?. The Doom Generation is as surreal as other Araki's films, and it picks up on a certain leit motif present in his cinematographic work religious zealousness and all it entangles. From Amy's mother (a fervent scientologist) to billboards with messages such as The Rapture is Coming (a doomsday of sorts according to certain religious sects as explained in Nowhere) or Prepare for the Apocalypse. Of course, there is also the constant emphasis on 666, the number of the beast; every time the characters buy food or have to pay for something, the price is exactly the same 6 dollars with 66 cents. 6.66. The film is thoroughly filled with what Genet would call paratextual references, here the writing on the wall is very visible, in every wall, in every store and gas station they visit.Reality seems to be seeping down under their very noses, although as Xavier reminds them I saw it on TV so it's gotta be true, right?. But there is little or nothing they can grab a hold on. And this capricious dynamic is reinforced by the fact that Amy is an interchangeable object a (object of desire), as a fast food employee confuses her with an old flame and chases her down, something that also happens with an enraged lesbian, and a gay man. All forms of sexuality (heterosexuality, male and female homosexuality) enable the completion of yet another trio.When Jordan, Amy and Xavier are finally ready for a threesome, something of the order of the real irrupts and dramatically changes everything. A violent group of men captures the protagonists, and threaten Jordan very seriously with removing his genitals. But what could castration mean? A rapport should be posited and established, from a subject of one sex to the phallus, and would not get inscribed by a rapport to the partner sexed differently. This is the value Lacan bestows on the universal allotted to the castration complex. Thus the Old Testament conjectures that Sodom will suit the man and Gomorrah the woman. If castration was metaphorical at the beginning (Jordan's inability to maintain an erection) here it takes a more literal approach, which is only fitting if we consider that sexual rapport for the protagonists will forever be impossible.

Brought to you by Gregg Araki. The Doom Generation is a gritty, super-dismal, often hilarious tale of murder, betrayal, and sleaziness. We begin with a young couple, hanging out at a club, Amy Blue (meth-head), and Jordan White (pot-head). Amy is a vindictive little nightmare, who's just looking for an argument. And Jordan, well, Jordan doesn't do a whole lot of thinking, but is a good guy, who loves Amy, despite her personality issues. Amy and Jordan take it to the car, so they can lose their virginity, but are soon interrupted...Meet Xavier Red (killer), X for short.Xavier rudely enters Amy's car, rudely demanding she start driving so that he may live, rudely insulting her, subtly insulting Jordan, but he doesn't mind. Amy on the other hand, is about to blow her top, but at least she has someone to argue with now... no wait, he just went too far. Alright guy!! Out of the car.Later in the evening, the teenage, odd couple are rescued by their new pal, X from a trigger-happy, convenience store clerk. after X literally blows the mans head off. They all 3, right then and there, decide to take a road trip together, leaving behind everything. The night sure is going to hell, but at least Amy has someone to argue with again, that's what's important. It doesn't take Xavier long to make his intentions clear, with Amy, and despite the fact that she despises him, she's all for it. They don't try all that hard to hide this from Jordan, but it's cool, Jordan doesn't mind, X seems like a nice guy. Amy doesn't mind Xavier's insults, Jordan doesn't mind that the man is sleeping with his girlfriend, and no one seems to be all that bothered by the fact that X kills someone every time they stop somewhere.The Doom Generation is harsh, and mean-spirited, and can be ugly, at times, just a swell movie, probably Araki's best. The religious, and apocalyptic metaphors won't go unnoticed, and neither will Rose McGowan, as a foul-mouthed teenager, with a chip on her shoulder, with James Duval's performance making her seem even worse. Some things occur, seemingly with the intention of confusing us, but that's OK, confusion only makes this seem more like exploitation from decades past. For something slightly similar, check out Nowhere... which reminds me, if you ever see both these movies, you might notice that it would be a much better fit if they switched the titles, just a thought. Although, The Doom Generation is deeper than it may seem, it's still a grim good time, with no redeeming qualities, Generation-X-ploitation. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Brilliant, dark romantic comedy.","Date":"6 May 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" The Doom Generation is a stunning, gripping, gut-wrenching movie. It's easy to see why reactions are so strongly polarized, with almost everybody either loving it or hating it. It's scary to imagine what kind of mind would react with genuine indifference.I admit I didn't read all the reviews already posted for it, but in the ones I did read I was surprised to find so few that mentioned how funny and how charming this movie is. Like it or not, it's primarily a romantic comedy, and if you miss that you've missed what holds it all together. It's extremely intelligent, very dark, very sweet, profoundly erotic, and shockingly bloody. But most of all it's very, very funny. If I'd missed the humor, I'd still like the freewheeling sexiness, but I'd be appalled by the violence. But I didn't miss the humor, so I loved it all.Everything about it is brilliant the writing, the direction, even the gory special effects, and every single member of the large cast is perfect, especially the three leads. For a heterosexual movie, as Araki labeled it (with some irony, I have to think), with plenty of sex between the girl and both guys, the most powerfully erotic scenes are between the two men alone. There's no sex acted out between them at all, not even a kiss, but the heat is intense and stunning, much more powerful than the explicit sex between either of them and the girl. It's the best proof I've ever seen that eroticism and sex are completely different, and in a movie eroticism is much more entertaining. The sex acts in this movie may be all hetero, but the real heat is as gay as it gets. That's quite a coup.I for one am glad it's not in widescreen on the DVD. If a movie that's filmed widescreen is shown at 43, you do lose information. But a lot of independent movies from that period were filmed at 43, so that a widescreen version just crops off the top and bottom of the picture, and you actually get less information. (The widescreen version of Gus Van Sant's brilliant Elephant is like that, but fortunately that DVD includes both versions.)

Everything they buy costs the same amount- it's quite dreamlike at points.This nudges some gay sexual boundaries here and there but it's usually tastefully shot scenes so we don't have to see explicit details- but you still get that potentially uncomfortable idea thrown at you since they are continually co-habitating as a trio. If you have a lot of gay rage you are going to be annoyed and probably would make a good drinking buddy of the guys showcased at the end of the flick.All in all this is like a teenagers Dali painting on film with a gloomy kinda goth vibe to our lead character. This is pulp all the way- a violent decadent indulgent confection of letting the story wander right into the depths of insanity without blinking. My kind of flick.

Well, what is it?Firstly, there are apocalyptic symbolics throughout the film (remember the 666 gag, for example?) and all the characters seem to represent the same age group. The title, DOOM GENERATION, gives us a clue of what this film is about, doesn't it?Secondly, it's a road movie. The point with all road movies is to depict an inner growth in the characters, while travelling long distances. This movie deliberately doesn't let the characters grow more mature, or let the story get sappy. The characters encounter terrible things one after another, but instead of showing any signs of remorse or human feelings, it leaves the persons cold and without any feelings, thus depicting the numbness of the so called Generation X, that the characters represent.The journey leads nowhere, and so do we, this generation, the director seems to say. A generation so jaded by such an evil world that we're living in today, can't possible go anywhere but further where humanity has gone since it's dawn, to the end. Sure, it's pessimistic, but it has got a point, not a nice one but worth thinking.A word of warning should be in it's place, if you're thinking about watching this.

Does he then become guilty of the same sins he is (literally!) fleshing out on screen?People who love this movie solely because it bravely (or pathetically, depending on your point of view) dares show graphic acts of a disturbing nature are probably not too far off from resembling some of the characters in this movie themselves.People who hate this movie because it seemed like a pointless, plotless, and tasteless sorry excuse for depicting some of the most gross acts of sex and violence allowable on film are probably missing the whole point that Araki is trying to make. So, is there a common ground between these two polars?If we try to give him the benefit of the doubt, we would try to say that Araki is indeed trying to get a message across, that message being that today's Gen X culture could lead to such a 'doomsday'-ish scenario, hence the title. But yet, my opinion is that he has been caught up in the very trap that he is trying to expose the over-explicit, in-your-face, and often pretentious so-called-art that his characters aspire to.Restraint is often the most powerful weapon of storytelling. And sadly, Araki has failed to acknowledge that in this movie. The fact that he belabors the 'clever' bits of the movie to such a ridiculous point, i.e. the sheer repetitiveness of the plot, that 666 gag, seems to undermine the intelligence of his audience. It's like knocking our head over and over again to make us realize the hurt.Therefore, in that respect, I think he has failed.Having said that, some qualities can still be salvaged out of this movie. The multi-colour visuals and the not-so-obvious puns are interesting, to say the least, and the ultimate fate of the three central characters at the end of the movie seems to portray something deeper than what is at hand.

Don't look for a particular message, there's no such thing inside, even if the trailer wants this to be a 90s landmark (which raised my expectations and subsequently the tone of my criticism). The producers resort to the refuge of the uninspired, sex and violence, to make the film bearable.

The film almost defies description, but is perhaps best thought of as something that Joseph Minion ('After Hours'; 'Motorama') might write after watching 'Southland Tales' with the trio encountering increasingly weird and unhinged individuals on an increasingly apocalyptic journey, at least half of whom seem to mistake the female protagonist as someone from their past. The price $6.66 keeps recurring too, and the way the drifter constantly seems on the cusp of seducing both the young lovers, there is room to wonder if he is meant to be some sort of demon or devil or something else. Writer-director Gregg Araki provides no clear-cut answers though, and unlike his latter equally weird and apocalyptic 'Nowhere', this earlier effort does not benefit so much from the ambiguity since it is less of a character study than 'Nowhere'. As pure entertainment though, 'The Doom Generation' works much better with so much unadulterated weirdness in the mix that there is never a boring moment be had. James Duval's final scene is unforgettable too, with strobe lighting effects enhancing the pure horror of it. The film offers a refreshingly different take on teen romance with characters who debate the fact that I love you can mean different things and whose running away together proves anything but romantic in a traditional sense.

Her and her best friend (Duvall) pick up sexy hitchhiker, Schaech, and what begins is a crazed journey of debauchery, and violence which escalates into a sickeningly shocking and memorably scene of violence in it's finale, leaving one less traveler. Yes the movie is entertaining as f..k, with a few instances (666 and I'll find her and her kill her) plus a cameo by Christopher Knight, aka Peter Brady and Lauren Tewes from The Love Boat as news anchors. The dialogue is juicy and originally cutting and informative, one line of dialogue, referring to Dickie Gere's butthole. The last scene and dreary ending song, has always stayed with me, prefore a experimental film of madness, which Araki shows you again, how the gay are wronged, and the independence of their characters living in a world of angst. They suffer insult, day to day, but paying no heed to those ignoramas's out there, where of course this subject is always gonna be frowned upon. Of course, compared to his other two films before hand, this one has much little reference to it.

For the most part, great movies must offer more than just entertainment, they must provide with a whole set of another qualities, and stay in your mind for whatever reasons. The Doom Generation stays with you for a long time due to a calculated slickness, painfully missed by practically all the demanding viewers and reviewers who simply couldn't understand the director's proposition with this apparently misguided, twisted violent film. News Flash it's a spoof!The target here is not only the violent action/thriller flicks but also the satires made on those films such as the time very fresh Natural Born Killers, from which borrow its storyline structure of following a criminal couple on the loose. Well, a little different, perhaps. A young couple (Rose McGowan and James Duval) is involved in a series of crimes after bumping into a mysterious drifter (Johnathon Schaech) who reveals to be a complete psychopath who kills everyone on their way. Or better saying, everyone on the girl's way cause she's like a magnet for trouble, and all the strange, dangerous and demented people they meet claim to had known her (it has some Scott Pilgrim feels and that way before its creation). Next thing you know, the nice trio of troubled misfits are deeply involved as friends, sexual partners with some love/hate in between and adding more and more crimes and victims on their run. Hollywood and its entertainment products for the masses dispose their garbage at us every year with plenty of movies that are pointless, with no good plots, using of sometimes excessive and most of the time pointless violence, all which later is labeled as entertainment, fun for all the family. Ever since the 1970's, and the trend is still strong. This movie is simply poking fun at their schemes, so Araki couldn't miss with this and he made something ten thousand times better than all those lousy films ever made. And it was more than criticism, it was a fun experience. Insanely weird but fun and pure 1990's. And graciously well-acted. The wild group is explosive, sexy, funny, just wished the director would stop with the tease between James and Johnathon and let them do something (the sexual tension between these two is just...you must see it!). The majority complains of poor line delivery, terrible script and acting, tasteless movie. Not at all. It's all calculated to appear that way but it's far from being a despicable work.

Gregg Araki really struck a nerve with those coming of age in the 1990s who had an interest in the Gothic an industrial music scene. With the inclusion of references to Nine Inch Nails, Ministry and Skinny Puppy, it was perfect for that demographic.The 1990s had a nihilistic undertone that was not seen in the 1980s or 2000s, leading to such films as Seven, Dark City, and the popularity of Tim Burton and David Fincher.

Of course these interpretations are what makes a movie stand out. I could'nt say what strikes me the most about this film, I only watched it for the violence and nude scenes. I just saw it also as a satire on the teen genre and road movies. They cuss like sailors and have very little empathy for just about everything (with a little exception for the dog they ran over.)The movie has three charactersAmy blue Jordan white Xavier redTheir last names obviously references the American flag so I guess they represent todays American youth.I've read about metaphors about Xavier being a devil and Jordan as an angel fighting over Amy blue who is in interpretation of the human race. I'll admit I didn't look at it that way when I first viewed the film. I just saw it as a straight forward indie film. With exaggerations of American pop culture and a 90's soundtrack. Of course I do like it that the film has layers of meaning and what araki wanted to convey in his messages.ThemesEvery stranger they bumped into seem to know who Amy blue is and they call her by different names. They also have violent tendencies towards her.666. I don't need to tell you what that symbol is about, it is used numerous times.The feds who are after Amy blue for the murder of a store clerk. the men sitting across from each other are twins. This is a pun about them being a uniformed society.Billboard signs messaging them about the rapture. Of course araki is satirizing Americas obsession with the end of the world. The world hasn't ended yet *knock on wood* but the perfect world Amy and Jordan created does end with his death. So the human race might not end anytime soon but each person has their own end that will eventually come.In the end after Jordans death Amy and Xavier keep riding in spite of their traumatic event.

At the time, I loved this film--it was flashy, violent and angst-ridden, basically everything I wanted to be. After I quit smoking, stopped dressing like a techno-druggie and stopped worrying about who had weed I could buy, I decided to view this film again. Man, this film is pretty flipping retarded. First off--I know that the director was trying to make a surreal road movie and that many of the elements of the film were subject to deus ex machina. However, I kind of had a problem with the fact that these kids were on the road for like two weeks, never really changed their clothes, never exercised, smoked like fiends and ate quick-stop chili dogs for breakfast lunch and dinner yet they all still looked like they just stepped out of a Hot Topic fashion shoot. White teeth, blowed dried hair and great skin adorned all of the teenagers in this film. Now, maybe I'm just being a movie snob I don't know. But if this film had been any good, I think I could forgive incongruencies such as the aforemntioned hygiene issues. However, the film itself was pretty much self-indulgent crap that I'm sure symbolized the fleeting nature of youth and innocence and hope or some other goofy avant-garde bull. However, if you can somehow accept this film for what it is--over the top, overly artsy-fartsy and trying to make a myriad of nonsensical statements, then at least the crap becomes somewhat beautiful. In fact, I think I can only recommend this movie to people who are fans of the stars--it features a pre-Donnie Darko James Duvall and a pre-fame Rose McGowan (both actors are featured in pretty hot sex scenes, for those of you wondering). Jonathon Schaech I couldn't really give a crap about since he was the worst actor in the film He was pretty good in That Thing You Do but after that he fell off my radar.

Rose McGowan is Amy Blue, a quick tongued, cynical, speed freak with Doc Marten boots, a leather jacket, and a bob haircut reminiscent of Bettie Page. James Duval is Amy's boyfriend Jordan White who lives in Encino, California. Jordan is a naïve, innocent teen, with long hair, a pierced ear and a Ministry t-shirt. At the beginning of a seemingly average night, the two lovers meet Jonathon Schaech as Xavier Red, a sarcastic, sexy, older guy with tattoos and a D.A.R.E. t-shirt. With a script chock-full of one-liners and liberal use of the word 'f**k' these three misfits embark on a journey filled with psychos and quickie marts.Gregg Araki enlists various 'What ever happened too&#133;' actors and popular musicians to appear in cameos throughout the film. This adds to the insanity and surrealism of the film while keeping its originality.There are four reoccurring themes that are so bizarre déjà vu seems an everyday occurrence. 1) The number 666. The total for food no matter where the characters go is $6.66. The address of the Headless Horseman where our misfits spend a night is 666. 2) big black-and-white signs. On the highway a large black sign with white letters reads The Rapture is Coming. In a convenience store a white sign with black letters warns Shoplifters Will Be Executed. 3) mistaken identity, which turns out to be not so innocent. Three different people mistake Amy Blue for someone else, and they are certain of their beliefs. 4) The phrase 'I'm gonna find her, and then I'm gonna kill her' spoken by a cashier at Carnoburger, a woman at a bar, and a Nazi in a book store.Watching this film spectators quickly realize this is the worst day these characters have ever had.

What a program!  It is so HORRIBLE.I had to slap myself to stay awake.  The film takes the aspect of a road movie, and puts lots of meaningless « surreal » inserts that are so obvious and pretentious and tries to get style and get a status of « artsy and original film ».  It's not that easy making a surreal film, and it has to be more implicit than that.  This film is the « pop » of surreal films.It's like saying  « Blink 182, that's punk music, man, they play so fast and they like skateboarding! » or « Limp Bizkit is metal, there are electric guitars in it!!! ».The director probably thought  « Right, so if there are stupid messages saying that society sucks written on walls in some scenes, an overall apocalyptic message or exaggeratedly violent and horny teens, this is surreal stuff! »  It seemed like Araki, plugging Neo-nazis, threesomes, some scenes of mildly gory violence (and they are not impressive at all, and trust me, I have seen the unrated version) and loads of swear words simply and gratuitously tried to shock some faint-hearted viewers, even though the film, for a normal person, wouldn't be too disgusting.The acting is annoying, especially from Rose McGowan, who really shows her phenomenal lack of talent.  Right, she plays a shallow character, but her lines are so badly written, stupid, and ridiculously overloaded with F-words in places where they really don't fit.

The movie's opening credits introduce this as a heterosexual story (or something like that), but Araki couldn't help but including some homosexual stuff. Araki, being the (openly) gay director that he is, just couldn't resist throwing in some homosexuality into this love triangle. But considering how much of other - much worse - perversion he included, homosexuality was basically begging to be included as well (and extremely mild by comparison). Araki's only, or primary, concern was to shock; never mind writing good dialog or presenting a clever story - the sole purpose was to repulse (or delight - if you like this sort of thing). There is (repeated) masturbation, homosexuality, decapitation, rape, McGowan's introduction into the wonderful world of threesome love (double-entry sex included), a man licking his own sperm, etc. And while some of this stuff is pretty heavy for a movie - and certainly too much to bear for most viewers to see all this stuff lumped together in one short movie - I wasn't really that shocked. I've basically seen all there is to see in films. However, Araki goes way over-the-top with the ultra-violent finale; Duval gets his penis cut off with huge pliers and then gets it shoved into his mouth. This isn't shocking; it's simply repulsive, but without serving any purpose whatsoever plot-wise.Some of the sexual situations could very well have had their debuts in the history of film. There is the scene in which Duval pisses, while he watches McGowan take a bath. He then gets horny and they have sex in the bathtub, while Schaech watches them, masturbates, comes, and then licks his own sperm (not that licking anyone else's is any less disgusting). Or there is a scene in which Duval catches McGowan cheating on him by having sex with Schaech, and how does Duval react to this? He doesn't get angry or even; he starts masturbating. One of the earlier scenes had McGowan and Duval trying to have sex in the car, but Duval couldn't get it up. (This may or may not be an intentional similarity to Bonnie & Clyde; Clyde couldn't get it up at all.) In yet another scene McGowan is encouraged by the free-spirited Schaech (who somehow reminded me of Motley Crew's moronic Tommy Lee) to be more open-minded and stick her finger up his anus while he was penetrating her. She reluctantly agreed, but learned to love it. Who wouldn't? Certainly no one in this movie would mind it.Characters come and go, and they all want to kill the members of our love-triangle. Araki sets up a certain amount of characterization, but keeps it very basic; McGowan is the anarchic and confident young female, Duval is a borderline moron, and Schaech is the mysterious stranger with no self-imposed limitations as far as sex, and to a lesser extent violence, are concerned. All the other characters are at least as confused and violent as the main trio. Wherever they go they are met with hostility, for no other reason than to give Araki a chance to do something brutal in the film, over and over. Araki's attempts at humour certainly curb a lot of the impact of the violence, some of which is pretty much in the zombie vein of an early Peter Jackson film; for example, a guy's head gets cut off but continues to live and talk, or the fast-food guy getting his arm severed, but without being phased too much. The dialog and situations are primitive. Anyone could have written this script. But it takes a twisted-minded lunatic like Araki to actually do it, and then even make a movie out of it. The humour is also primitive, and rarely amusing, though there are maybe one or two uncharacteristically wry observations. One of those cleverer moments, absurdly, comes from the dumb-as-dirt Duval, who asks McGowan whether her love for him only means that he will do for the time being until someone better comes along strange as it may seem, this primitive and ultra-extreme movie has succeeded, through Duval's just-mentioned statement-question, in making the best definition of love that I have ever heard. On a couple of occasions Araki makes rather half-assed attempts to satirize the media and authority; it isn't effective at all.Aside from the unnecessarily unpleasant ending, the film is watchable for some reason. Rose McGowan certainly helps. Those breasts...

Personally, if a bloody dude hopped in the back of my car while I was having sex, i would have reacted a bit differently. Amy, however, yells at his because he is getting blood on her carpet. Amy has a trash mouth which she uses throughout the film. Everytime the trio goes to buy something, it costs 6.66 & they can't find the money. So they shoot the cashier, or drive off etc. Amy keeps coming across people who swear they know her as someone else & say they broke her heart or something. When she tells them off, each of them vows to kill her & ends up coming after her. there is a lot of nudity, as Amy becomes very sexual with both Jordan & Xavier. Jordan, who seems a bit lost in life, dismisses the fact that is girlfriend is sleeping with Xavier; he finds it erotic.

Even the main characters in this film declare that they are too precious for this world! HOW PRETENTIOUS!This film is not good. There is a scene in the film where the characters run over a dog in their car. Xavier Red then slits the dogs throat. Does this animal symbolise the viewer? Boy I wished I was that dog.Before a bunch of 1st year university art students start claiming that I just don't get it. I would like to say that many years ago, I was a teenage goth. It has been a very long time since I have worn a fishnet top. With my beer belly now this would not be a good look. However, if I was anything like these people I would have shot myself long ago.I felt like I was watching part of Gregg Araki's own therapy sessions. His sexual fantasies and his own repressed hatred for the rest of society. That is where the film becomes pretentious. He seems to say that he is above everybody. This is actually a common feature in goths. They seem to argue their points on the fact that you are just, like, so bourgeois. They don't realize this is all part of their own identity formation as they are trying to find themselves. They reject their environment to feel superior and different.You can see all of this taking place in this film. Jordon and Amy reject the club. Jordan and Amy also feel contempt for everyone around them. The store owner, the city, the fastfood restaurant staff, the jocks, the media, parking attendants and old people. So once you state that everybody sucks then what do you do?...ummm...I know, lets throw in some violence! Isn't it hilarious when a severed head vomits! Oh my sides! Besides from my sarcasm a similar scene has already been filmed by David Lynch in Wild at Heart. Lynch and John Waters are both influences here.Where is Araki's ear for dialogue? I have not heard dialogue so badly written and then spoken since Attack of the Clones! It is all so contrived! None of the actors seem to be natural. They all overact and the performances are a mess. The films flavor reminded me of the work of Harmony Korine. Korine who I personally think is still growing as a film maker is more talented. Korine's freaks are paraded before us in a completely naturalistic way. All the dialogue uttered in Korines films feels at least partially natural. The actors in Doom all sound like b-movie actors saying lines. I don't think Araki is trying to be camp. It is just pure incompetence. I have seen better acting in my local soap,  Shortland Street. Please James 'it's trippy man' Duval, stay away from acting! This guy is like Keanu Reeves junior and they both disgrace their profession. Also, Rose Mcgowan should stay in Marilyn 'I'm shocking, Really!' Mansons mansion and keep his snake fed. She utters inane lines like 'eat my f**k.' When a character starts using 'totally' many times in a sentence, it is time to tune out and do something else. I just wished that the character Amy would shut up. She was just so whiny and annoying!Duval spends most of his time saying inane things as well. 'Everything is like, so beautiful man!' The characters go on a road trip. Xavier begins to erode these two characters social norms. Xavier is repugnant, which Amy actually says. Xavier kills people and shags both Amy and Jordan. His influence is so much that he influences these characters sexual tastes. The sexual scenarios get more and more out there. So the viewer is treated to Araki's sexual fantasies. Jeez, aren't we lucky? It is just as well that Araki stopped where he did because otherwise we would be returning back too the realms of using chickens like in Pink Flamingos. That is the problem with the film, it goes for shock value but this stuff has already been done! It has also been done with more skill and filmed more explicitly. So the whole thing seems pointless.Araki decides on having no plot. I felt this film would be o.k if it was a comic book aimed at goth teens. I imagine that they would dig it. But then there would be no soundtrack What is the bet that the soundtrack actually did better than film? When a film has to be sold on its soundtrack, well that film is doomed. The Doom Generation has an apt title.Through the film we sense all of Araki's hostility towards mainstream society. You notice with the lack of parental figures in this film. It is almost like that Araki is making a statement about parents not being there for their kids. Not giving the attention and affection that they need. None of them expect their parents to help them when they get into trouble. The characters state that, my parents committed suicide, mine is a drug addict, mine is a Scientologist. Notice the news report, 'commonly worn by homosexuals, satanists and other dangerous groups.' Notice when the frat boys, the guys at the end with the handy pair of garden shears, rape Amy on the American flag to the national anthem music. Notice the fast food restaurant, with the horrendous titles for the meals. Araki isn't vegetarian by any chance? He does not seem to like meat. Notice how he makes fun of people at fast food restaurants by virtually labeling them as rednecks with bad teeth. I observed these moments in the film and thought, 'thats satire?' Araki is just so subtle. The fastfood guy with one arm missing chasing the main characters. Again, oh my sides.Why didn't he just take 15 minutes by coming on camera and declaring that fast food restaurants suck, jocks/frat boys suck, clubs with idiots asking you for drugs suck, convenience store owners who are pedantic about their smoke free policy suck, rape sucks, having your penis cut off with garden shears sucks and a homophobic America sucks. On all of these points I would agree with him. But then it wouldn't be a pretentious, posing movie would it?Another annoying thing is the cameo factor. Just because some famous people, Heidi Fleiss and Perry Farrell appear in your film does not mean it is going to be any good. This is a cheap attempt to get viewers and street credibility. If Farrell appeared in my film he must like and believe in it! No, he just needed the money. The interior decorating is another factor. Just because you make rooms look surreal and include signs like 'OBEY,' this still does not make your movie cool. Those signs irritated me terribly. Can you be any more heavy handed? Ever heard of symbolism Araki?Finally Araki tries to turn Jordan into Jesus. Being 'white,' he is a pure figure who loves unconditionally. Because of this he needs to be turned into a martyr figure. So Jordan gets the garden sheers and Amy gets raped. I think Xavier is meant to be the snake who imparts knowledge. His knowledge seems to be 'loosen up your sexual boundaries.' Swingers would love this guy. Are we meant to conclude that free love is the answer?  The problem with the last violent scene is that these characters are so badly written that you don't give a damn about any of them. I just wanted the homophobic, gym crazy, frat boys to kill them all so that the film would end. The Doom Generation is quite short but still manages to drag because of its lack of any story.This gets 2 out of 10 from me. What a shallow piece of crap!

This thing claims to be a comedy. Comedy?! The only time I laughed was at the acting. James Duval delivered his lines in a manner that makes Keanu Reeves look like a ten-time Oscar winner.The plot is virtually nonexistent. They drive, they stop somewhere for greasy food (and the total price of everything they buy totals to $6.66), they accidentally kill someone, they check in at a sleazy motel, have erotic sex, and wake up the next morning and do it all over again. It gets old very quickly. The only reason I kept watching was to see if the plot eventually went anywhere. But no, the film continues in its circular manner until the totally out-of-place climax, and it just ends. I'm sure that's frustrated more people besides just me.Even the technical aspects are sub-standard.

I can think of only two positives about this film, which is why I'm giving it a 2 the first is the soundtrack. Several 90s songs are played in the background during the pointless dialogue. Thank God those songs were there because they were the only things making those scenes tolerable. I also heard some late 80s tunes from time to time. However, if you're not a fan of this type of music, then this positive aspect won't appeal to you. The second positive I can think of was when there was about ten seconds of meaningful dialogue near the end of the film. James Duval's character asks Xavier what the meaning of existence is. Although the answer is rather banal and empty, at least there was an attempt to broach a deeper, more philosophical topic. That one line isn't probably worth a whole star, but I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today. But in no way do these two positives make up for the other 83 minutes of dreck.Avoid this film.

Roger Ebert's review on the film pretty much sums up my opinions on it as well (I rarely agree so strongly with Ebert as I do about this film).Doom Generation is a self-indulgent film that is riddled with so many in jokes that they lose any sense of importance by the middle of the film.  Seeing Rose McGowan naked was the high point (or points) of the film, and that does not say much (Rose is beautiful, but I need more than T&A to get through a film).  The director obviously felt no need to be anything but obscure and self-referential and so managed to alienate any particular audience he might have developed.  Yes, the film can be funny.  Yes, I got most of his cutsie culture references and in-jokes (although some were so obscure that they must have been related to personal experiences of the cast and crew).  No, I was not disturbed or offended by the violence, I simply saw no need for it.This film dances around interesting ideas, but goes absolutely nowhere.  Perhaps this was the point, but even if it was it still does not hold much interest to me.  Nihilism for the sake of nihilism is simply boring.

I would like to say that a dead donkey di-ock may be shocking, intriguing, and interesting for some people to look at for an hour and a half, but most people do not find this entertainment. In defense of the great cult film directors John Waters, Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton, and David Lynch that other reviewers has mentioned or alluded to, this is not fair to the aforementioned directors. They could crap out a better film while on a cocktail of illicit drugs and junkfood than this flim could wish to be on a good day. So please, resist your urge, and do not profane these film-makers with comparison to this dog-vomit on celluloid. Whoever funded this film, I want to talk to them about funding the film for the camera in the bottom of my toilet (heh). I bet I'd get a higher rating. Next, I'd like to say that if you are into the worst films on the planet, this one comes nowhere close to The Underground Comedy Movie, Mac & Me, or Jack Frost (the one with Michael Keaton). Also, I consider Faces of Death to be on that list, but if you like shock for shock's sake and want to feel like you want to puke from real-life horror, then this film is not hardcore enough for you, try that one. This film is a travesty not for the many aforementioned reasons, but for the fact that it once again defaces Generation X as a monster it isn't (I should know, I'm part of that so-called generation). It reminds me of all the afraid of the youth films that were made in the 60's. Too many great bands are wasted in promotion of this film, and that is travesty number 2 (Nine Inch Nails, Medicine, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, This Mortal Coil, The Smiths, Curve, Love & Rockets, Cocteau Twins, Wolfgang Press, Meat Beat Manifesto, Jesus & Mary Chain, MC 900 Ft. Jesus, Lush, Babyland . . . and many more). The third travesty is that it is bound to be compared against the visionaries in the field of film actually making great film, as mentioned earlier. This includes people admitting they get it, whether they call it camp, farce, dark, underground, alternative, shock, experimental, exploitation, avante-garde, film-noir, anti-hero, gothic, et. al. That is the real joke being played on those who try to convince everyone else it is redeemable by using these film styles to say the film doesn't suck. But suck nonetheless it does. You can't avoid that fact unless you are without personality. I like all of the above mentioned styles of film and more, but this film is SERIOUSLY lacking in the direction, script, storyline, acting, dialogue, and other major factors, all which would make a good film. You cannot be at a loss of so many important film characteristics and have a good film. Thus, although it has been said before, this is truly an exercise of style over substance, apparently in the desperation to do the above mentioned con of the public into thinking it is great, or just selling soundtrack albums. If you want style AND substance in the vein this movie tries to be in, may I recommend the following films The Crow, Natural Born Killers, Lost Highway, The Addams Family, Beetlejuice. This film is sadly, like none of these and is most like the film Baise-Moi in its substance. So if you nonetheless like this film you will probably like that one. So all in all, if you have to watch this movie I would conclude it is best with the sound turned off (no kidding) and your favorite period music from any of the above bands or soundtrack movies that I mentioned as good. And as mentioned before, it is nice to see Rose McGowan naked again and again, and not mentioned before, the other scene that is worth watching is the brief yo-yo scene. If you watch it, you'll know what I mean. The only thing really shocking about the film is how bad (readawful) it is and such a waste of talent and resources involved.

That's the EASY RIDER part.They are joined by a menacing type, RED, (that's where the KALIFORNIA analog comes in) who quickly displaces WHITE as the alpha male. He turns WHITE, to an extent, into the C.W. Moss character of BONNIE and CLYDE (1967) -- but not completely.WHITE still remains the romantic if not the visceral lover of BLUE, the woman-in-the-middle.  (BLUE'S behavior would have qualified her to make a blue movie in the 1960s.  She measures fidelity in minutes.)So we have the full team, RED, WHITE and BLUE.  Get it?RED, a young man with Jesus tattooed where no tattoo should be at all, is so obscenely uncouth he proves to be exciting, in a sort of 1950s Jack Kerouac / Ken Kesey Hells Angel biker kind of exciting.  He is handy to have around too, and puts to death each threat that the more naive BLUE and WHITE get themselves entangled with but can't handle.They, the original kids WHITE AND BLUE, are living testimonies to the advice Don't write checks with your mouth that your body can't cash!Confused yet?  So maybe it's more like JULES AND JIM (1962), an agreeable menage a trois?  Alas, a couple strips from the cutting floor of JULES AND JIM would be worth more than this whole film.BLUE, played by the wonderful young actress Rose McGowan, is on something? for most of the film.  She is thus either morose, icky, horny, asexual, off her feed, thirsty, hungry, or re-doing her lipstick that goes easily an inch back into her mouth.  WHITE is almost an idiot savant, loving everything he sees as if he were on LSD -- which he is not, look man, MY HAND, it's so beautiful.  YOU are so beautiful.  WE are so beautiful.  And so it goes.RED is the only interesting character.  But he is so hateful.  He reminds me a bit of Rob Lowe's Alex in BAD INFLUENCE (1990), playing to James Spader's wimpy Michael Boll -- that would be equivalent to the duo of WHITE and BLUE.

To say it was  bad is overrating it. The only thing I enjoyed was the amusingly decorated motels that the trio stopped it. It had no point, no plot, no interesting characters (or characters at all). Here is brief summery; three teenagers with no personality are driving all over, raiding stores (everything always costs $6.66, and having sex. Truly nauseatingly bad movie.

Through all that, it commits a cardinal sin It's dull. If it has a plot, it's slim; what there is is like the old porno movies where the lead character slowly descends into a world of debauchery. Well the world these characters find isn't very sexy, isn't very interesting, and has all the charm of the bottom of a chicken coop. If you want to see teen angst run amok, try The River's Edge, if you want to see teens on mad rampage, try Badlands. If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, see this--but go all the way and view it in a dumpster outside a Seven-Eleven. It might elevate the dramatic effect.

Think David Lynch minus both the subtlety and talent that actually makes HIS movies worth catching.As a facet of good film-making technique it failed miserably; but I gotta admit my attention was rapt at the screen a few times... (even more if you count McGowan letting the puppies loose... !) It showed me things I hadn't seen before. That said, there was an astonishingly good REASON why such things were 'new' to my experience; this being that they managed spectacularly not to work on any level other than shallow shock-value...This is lowbrow pulp satire with little humour beyond the sophomoric. Perhaps it wasn't meant to be 'funny' - but if so I find myself at a loss as to how ELSE I was expected to categorise certain incidences? A talking head spewing goo, post shooting fatality??! Kinda 'disturbing', too, I suppose; until you realise it's to be by no means an isolated occurrence in a film chock-full of pitifully embarrassing (and sadly intentional) non-sequiturs. It's all captured with a certain level of 'panache' by Araki, I guess; but even the staunchest of acolytes for people like Verhoeven and Tarantino would have a tougher job justifying the 'merits' of such an unapologetically 'excessive' approach as this - especially when it's sorely lacking in the intelligence or profundity that underpins the output of an Oliver Stone, say. The dialogue itself encapsulates perfectly how intellectually void the material is - Eat my f--k (fork!), you say????! Wow, how wonderfully APT a signifier of 'nothingness'; yet only because there is actually NOTHING to signify... !Looking at it from a sardonic angle once more; when your film contains one character (James Duval) doing a sub-par impersonation of Keanu Reeves throughout, then it should be taken as kind of a 'sign' that you could be achieving more as an artist! The characters were immensely difficult to have strong feelings of ANY persuasion toward in my case, because all they are is essentially cyphers. The oddities on show just about keep it watchable. JUST ABOUT. If that's the type of praise Araki would be satisfied with, though, then I fear for some people's perception of 'confrontational' cinema and its ultimate destination, I really do...(2/10 or */***** in profile ratings system) "},{"Title":"Absolutely Disgusting!!!

This movie made me so angry, I had to spend the next eight hours punching clowns to feel better. This movie is so bad that the frequent and gratuitous showing of Rose McGowan's breasts don't even come close to justifying this film.With most movies, especially bad ones, I like to point out the more ridiculous moments because doing so can make a horrible film watchable. I can't do that with The Doom Generation, though. There is nothing in this movie that is any more ridiculous than any other part. This film has a terrible plot with horrible characters and wretched directing and then tries to pass it all off as camp. No, camp is kitschy fun. The Doom Generation is crap that disguises itself with pretentiousness. This movie is that nerdy kid who pretended he was smart because he wore glasses, but was really eating his paste until he was 25. The Doom Generation is a lot like the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey; it makes no sense and comes out of nowhere. It's just suddenly, SPACE BABY! Only, the Doom Generation does not have the benefit of the good director, script, and acting that 2001 had. Nor does the Doom Generation have the benefit of having any part of it even resembling good. I think the best way to summarize the Doom Generation is to say that absolutely anything can happen. And I literally mean that. After the first half hour, if a dinosaur came on screen and ate someone, Rose McGowan would have made a nonsensical comment involving the F-word and the audience would have to think to themselves, Oh, right. Dinosaurs. They eat people. Films like this prey on the weak minded. Just because a movie is abrasive does not mean that it is worthy of being hip. I guess I'm trying to say that if you show this movie to someone else, you are a sociopath.

This one thing is so powerful it will stop you from watching this sorry excuse for a movie. In the movie a man masturbates and then licks the sperm off of his hand. Yes, you heard me right. Now I don't care if Rose McGowan walks around naked for the entire movie, is it really worth it if you have to watch a guy lick his own spunk.

The Amy character was so unbelievably cliché. To see a real performance of this type see R. Kern's masterpiece Fingered. Lydia Lunch spews/exudes so much more venom. As far as the nudity goes, I've seen more of Rose McGowan in those runway shots of her shred-dress and this was the uncensored director's cut no less. What was with the dime store Keanu Reeves stoner of a boyfriend? The homosexual tension? There was more of it in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. The $2.00 special effects? The attempt at black humor? The cameos by TV has-beens? I recommend ANY John Waters or Paul Morrisey film over this art house wannabe.

What crack are you smoking?! The gline posted an excellent review as to how freaking bad it really was..Here are some quotes.. The Doom Generation is one of the worst films I have ever seen -- a sickening, ridiculous, worthless bag of garbage. Sorry, but that's the truth. Saying I hated it is probably too kind -- for me to hate it would require some sort of emotional attachment to the material. I'll say I despise it, instead. I wouldn't want to get my fingers dirty. Why does this film not work, where a movie like Freeway or Badlands does? For one, those movies contained characters I cared about -- people who had personalities that extended beyond themselves. Everyone in The Doom Generation is a self-important asshole that we don't even want to give the time of day. Why watch them? Why bother with them if they live or die? At least the film deals with them in a mercifully short time frame 88 minutes.Look, I don't ask for much from a movie. I really don't. Some fun, some brains, some wit, some nice scenery. This movie doesn't have anything I ever want to set eyes on again. It is a wasteland of shock-the-squares film-making that was past its sell-by date when it first came out.

Quentin's movies have been accused of many things, but I've never seen one as relentlessly ugly as this copycat version.The movie is notorious for being rather `explicit,' as my TV guide (which gave it the lowest possible rating) labeled it &#150; but that is an understatement. This movie isn't as explicit as it is sick. For example, towards the beginning of the movie, two teenagers witness a hitchhiker blow off the head of a convenience store owner. It sails through the air and lands on a pile of food, and keeps on screaming, with ooze curdling out of its mouth. Later on, one of the teenagers watches through a window as his girlfriend and another man have sex. Standing outside in the middle of a public area, he drops his pants and begins to&#133;You get the idea. Then there's the disturbing threesome relationship, which becomes the entire focus of the film, but ends in a violent bloodbath of misery. Vital organs are stabbed, `lopped off' and mutilated. It's the sort of film that makes you wince in pain as you watch it.Threesome relationships have been handled well before, and I think most material &#150; no matter how offensive or disturbing &#150; can be done `right.' Violence, sex, or mayhem has all been filmed `right' in the past. But this movie isn't about doing anything right &#150; it's all about rebelling and doing the wrong things. Ironically, its director does do everything wrong. This movie rarely makes sense, features poor acting and a wandering, pointless plot. The romance is unbelievable, often bordering on exploitation and gruesome, crass references. Some say this is intentional &#150; that Araki purposely made his film as revolting as possible for `parody' reasons. Some say it's a beautiful romance buried underneath a layer of superficiality, attempting to satirize the whole teenage road odyssey cliché and our American way of life (the last names of the characters are Red, White and Blue). I think it's a load of crock. Whoever sees `The Doom Generation' as a deep social commentary needs help.I could delve into the plot, but there isn't one. Basically, the film begins with two teenagers (James Duval and Rose McGowan) on a road trip, and has them meet up with Xavier (Johnathon Schaech), a strange bisexual who kills people at random and totally revolutionizes their way of life &#150; supposedly, for the better. However, by the end of the movie (without ruining it), I had to wonder what on earth the entire point was. Everything this movie sets itself up for, it denies, and then contradicts. Most bad movies at least have some sort of point &#150; propaganda or otherwise. This doesn't. Unless, of course, it's just trying to show us that America has become a sick wasteland. If that was the point he was trying to make, Araki has succeeded, because this movie made me feel genuinely dirty and unclean. It left a disturbing aftertaste that will no doubt take quite a while to fade. I've never really loathed a film as much as I loathe `The Doom Generation.' For the first time ever, I'm going to actually plead with my readers not to see a movie. Please do not see `The Doom Generation.' I was curious and I wish I hadn't let my curiosity get the better of me. It truly is a waste of two hours that you will never get back, and possibly one of the worst films I've ever had the genuine displeasure of viewing.0/5  "}]
