Don't dismiss this as an expanded version of the TV series Jennifer is in, she's what she is, yet she fits into this story so well, playing opposite Jay Mohr and Kevin Bacon, with Ileanna Douglas as her best friend and Olympia Dukakis as her mom &#150; it's Jennifer Aniston perfect.The heart may not be evident in the beginning, especially with Jennifer's central character, but hang in there, heart becomes more and more ever present as you follow the story closely.  My appreciation for the nuances of this movie did not come deeper until I sat through it again on cable over the weekend. I remember I liked the movie in general and that Jay Mohr gave a very good performance &#150; he's just as becoming as Jennifer is. They do seem like a perfect pair.This could be a date movie especially for a single young woman with career ambitions (here it is in advertising), who thinks she can be self-sufficient without any ties or warmth from others, including mom. It is very much a city woman movie. It is maybe for the 20 to 30 something's, yet there are lessons in loving that anyone can take away with. Essentially, it is about how we can take for granted the people around us and not realize the little things in life that are free and in abundance for us to receive and enjoy &#150; if we would only open our eyes, pause - truly listen, and let the heart do the rest.Trivia There was a play on the movie title as it first appears and appears again. Ha! Have fun and enjoy.  "},{"Title":"A lovely, light romance.

Not a huge fan of either of them, but nevertheless I thought it might be interesting to see Aniston (during the peak of Friends' popularity) crossing over into mainstream film. For the most part, it works.She's basically playing Rachel, her character from the TV show, again. Aniston's character is a shy, awkward business woman who isn't promoted due to the fact that she is considered unstable - no husband, family, etc. So she hires a fake boyfriend, Nick (Jay Mohr), to pose as her lover. She ends up winning the affections of a man she has a crush on in her office (Bacon), but then Nick begins to actually fall in love with her.The title derives from the fact that she works at a picture agency, and that's where a lot of the film's scenes take place. It gets a little weary after a while, and is very predictable - but if you're a fan of the actors, it's reasonable to say you'll find something to enjoy here.

I enjoy the romantic comedy genre, so I gave it a shot.I won't say that Picture Perfect was completely awful because I did watch it all the way through. I will say that this film paints humanity in an ugly light.Kate is utterly self-centered, showing the total lack of awareness of others. The entire film is predicated on the decisions she makes out of her self-centeredness. Even the happy ending depends on Kate's lack of awareness for anyone else but herself. It doesn't occur to her that she's ruining a stranger's wedding because she can't wait 30 minutes to get out her apologies. The film's writer insults the viewer by assuming that because Kate manages a few tender moments while she's being selfish, we then are supposed to be endeared to her.Nick shows no dignity for his own self. The more he gets to know the self-centered Kate, the more he falls in love with her?? She insults him with her proposal, she is disrespectful and rude to him, she shows weak moral character by her affair with a colleague who is using her for thrill-sex... and yet, he professes that he likes her more and more. The viewers are expected to endear ourselves to him too.Kate's colleague, played by Kevin Bacon, only sleeps with women who are married or otherwise committed. Enough said.Kate's boss only shows his female staff respect based on whether or not they are stable, which in this case is determined by whether or not Kate is showing signs that she's in a committed relationship.Kate's friend encourages her to lie and cheat in order to fool her boss into thinking she's stable.Kate's mom is portrayed as an overbearing mother whose self-worth depends on the constant reassurance that her daughter cares about her.Kate's other work colleagues are portrayed as gossip-mongering and thoughtless.Don't be tempted to watch this. Whether it's intended or not, the film ends up being a commentary about the inherent selfishness of and lack of self-dignity in humanity.

A prop to help her get what she wants.What she wants is to sleep with a serial womaniser, to get promotion and higher pay and that's about it really.Then when she gets them she decides they aren't as shiny as she thought they'd be and wants the 'thing/stranger/wedding guy' to be her permanent plaything instead.She still has no idea about him as a person other than he took the time to get to know her (and for some incomprehensible reason given her behaviour and lack of any redeeming characteristics) and bought her a watch to replace one she lost as a child.Yet based on this tenuous reason she admits the subterfuge to her bosses and risks her job. Given she has already decided the job isn't all that great - it isn't that much of a sacrifice.Then the 'new improved' female gatecrashes a strangers wedding, risks the business of her intended 'plaything' by ensuring he will be remembered as the guy who ruined his clients wedding by being stalked by a nut job.For some reason this selfish, irresponsible act endears the used, abused 'plaything' guy so that he agrees to be 'the one' for her - kiss, kiss, end of film.The main guy character has in effect fallen in love with a selfish, controlling, manipulative, scheming narcissist and signed up to be treated badly until she finds something more shiny to distract her in the future.So given how stupid a lot of people are that bit is probably true to life at least.But touching, funny, heart warming - no it isn't.

Of course, we all know her as Rachel from Friends and that's probably the way it will always be. The same with the rest of the Friends cast. (There's absolutely nothing wrong with that though. Friends is the BEST.) I guess, that's why she's been type-casted for the last few years and why most of her films are of a romantic-comedy nature. Still, even though not many of them do very well on release, (That will change soon though.) she still does a good job in all of them, including this one.Picture Perfect is about Kate, (Jennifer Aniston.) a woman who really can't find love. She does fancy her work colleague Sam, (Kevin Bacon.) but he doesn't really seem interested in her, as she is with him. One day Kate is at a friends wedding and she meets Nick (Jay Mohr.) who is there to film the wedding. They have a chat, have there picture taken together and that's about it. Until, one day at work, Kate's friend Darcy, (Illeana Douglas.) tells everyone that Kate is engaged to Nick, so Kate can get promoted at her work. Everyone obviously believes it, so now it's up to Kate to ask Nick, if he can pretend to be her fiance, for a while and then later on in the 'relationship' they will have a break up in front of everyone . Nick agrees to do this. The only thing is Nick ends up falling for Kate and whilst Kate is 'seeing him,' she ends up sleeping with the guy she fancied in the first place, Sam. He seems to want her now, she's with someone.The story in the movie is a little unbelievable, but so what, it's a just a movie and it's a very enjoyable one too. It has one of those stories, where you can guess what's going to happen at the end straight away. Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr are all great here too. So, if you fancy seeing a romantic comedy (If you've already seen, classic movies like, Sleepless In Seattle and You've Got Mail, etc.) then Picture Picture is the one for you. I rate Picture Perfect an 8/10.

Nevertheless, when she receives no credit for a winning ad, Kate seeks advice. The buzz is that, because she is not married or does not have a family, the company is reluctant to promote her, thinking she might jump ship in the future. Shortly after learning this, Kate attends a wedding and asks Nick, a gentleman she meets there, to play the part of her fiancÃ© for a spell. Now, Kate is taken more seriously when she brings Nick along to company functions. Will there be any promotions or romantic complications in her future? This has got to be one of the best movies Aniston ever made. She is adorable and funny, she looks like a dream, and she handles the serious moments of the film with ease. Jay Mohr turns in a very likable performance as Nick and Kevin Bacon charms the audience in a lesser role. The plot was fun at full speed and the script has many memorable lines. If you are an aficionado of romance films, told with humor, and you love women with beauty, brains, and Buster Keaton's comic timing, don't hesitate to seek out this film while it may be found.

I thought it was very charming and well acted by Moore and Anniston. The story of a woman who has almost everything she wants, held back in her career because she doesn't fit the profile of the other executives to upon the advice of a friend she creates a fictitious husband. She coaches Nick (moore) to know everything about her so that when they meet with the big bosses they will be believable as an engaged couple. The ruse is that they are to have a big fight at this business dinner so that she can go on with her life as a single person, but portray herself to her company as someone who is destined for marriage and a more stable life.Of course this all goes awry when Moore falls for her and tells her he does not want to go through with the plan and break up and perhaps they should give each other a shot for real. She is not happy about this and decides that she's going through with her plan with or without Nicks cooperation. He sees she's not backing down so he helps her go through with the plan and it is a success.What troubled me about this story although very cute was his insistence that she was a manipulator and acted as if he was a victim. While I don't think it's very nice to use people in the way that she used him she DID tell him all about it in advance and gave him the chance to say yes or no. He opted to help her, but clearly he just wanted a chance to get closer to her and had no real intention of following through with the fake breakup. He just wanted a chance to be with her.So while it followed all the rules of the Hollywood formula I found it a bit unfair and manipulated myself.

Picture Perfect wasn't made to be thought-provoking or insightful--it exists purely to charm and amuse. Unfortunately, there's nothing charming nor amusing about the central idea in this witless script (that a woman who isn't married isn't taking her life seriously, and is therefore not a likely candidate for better pay at work). Jennifer Aniston struggles with creating a character out of absolutely nothing; she has a few nice, quiet moments, but her big scenes fall flat because the writing and directing are so bad. Jay Mohr, as a video-photographer for weddings, probably comes off the best here, even though there are no romantic sparks between him and Aniston (they seem more like brother and sister). Once again, Illeana Douglas is wasted in a second-banana role (she begins the movie calling the shots but then simply evaporates); Kevin Bacon has it even worse in a himbo role (and his long hair looks really unprofessional for an account executive in New York City!).

As a movie as a whole there isn't much that stands out from other movies, but I thought that the ending was cool and it was that which stuck in my mind.Basically the movie is about a girl who wants to get ahead but seems to be too picky about her men. As such, the good jobs are out of reach and the guy she likes is not interested because she is not married. So, when people see a photo of her sitting on a man's lap, she seizes upon the opportunity to say that he is her fiancÃ©. Things start to turn around, until they decide to meet him, so she tries to arrange with him to break off their relationship, but unfortunately he falls in love with her, and she realises that he is actually quite a nice guy.I guess there are a couple of things that stick out here. The main thing is in regards to what the boss says at the beginning of the movie. Basically the company is only interested in promoting you if you are a safe investment - namely you will not run off to another company because they give you a better offer, so what they do is encourage you to marry, buy an expensive house and an expensive car, so that you are such in debt that you need to keep the job.It seems more a safeguard for the corporation than for the person involved, because if they stuff up badly then they loose their job and are in deep thickets because they are no longer on such a great income. I guess it also says that a little white lie to get ahead is okay, but in reality it is not. Once one begins to live a lie, or get trapped in a fantasy world, then when reality hits home, you cannot handle it.This movie is okay, and the ending is great, but unfortunately some of the moralistic overtones simply suck.

I'm sure she'll quit starving herself into ever tighter dresses, and pick a decent character role soon.  Hopefully she'll make the switch before her cleaving re-arranging affectations becomes sad and tired rather than cute and winning.Kevin Bacon either read a different script than the one they actually used, or he owed big money to the wrong people, because he's badly underused in this film.  The rest of the competent cast say their lines and try not to trip over the furniture, but they're also not given much material to work with.It's not funny, and Anniston's character is too fundamentally horrid for it to be romantic.

She has everything figured out right down to how they act and know about each other. Mohr obviously doesn't want to follow the plan. Standard formula romance that is never given justice.

Olympia Dukakis is also featured as if it matters. Kevin Dunn plays Aniston's boss whose role is to predictably to discredit her. It could have demonstrated how selfish ambition can damage reputations but instead it is subdued in sitcom romantic clichÃ©s that water down any meaning.

In other words, she's single and doesn't own a home, etc. Her best friend (Illeana Douglas) encourages her to fake an engagement to a guy she barely knows from Boston, Nick (Jay Mohr), and then stage a break-up after she gets promoted. Meanwhile, Kevin Bacon lurks in the background as the office lothario.Jennifer proves that she has what it takes to carry a major film, no sweat; it's just that the movie in question is mediocre. Actually, I thought the first hour was quite amusing for a romcom, but after the big staged break-up it got dull as a certain character does some serious soul-searching. However, the cast is fine and I think Picture Perfect would be appreciated more by fans of 'chick flicks' and Aniston. Bacon is excellent as the bad boy, but Kate's just too good for him, literally. There is a good lesson at the end and I liked the boss' honest response to a certain person's confession.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in New York City and nearby West Orange, New Jersey.GRADE C "},{"Title":"bland rom-com","Date":"7 February 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Kate Mosley (Jennifer Aniston) is 28 year old working single girl.

Kate (Jennifer Aniston) works in advertising but can't really progress in her job because everybody else has a nice stable marriage and a house of their own, and she's unlucky in love and still staying with her mother. Her good girl image is also a turn off for her sexy adulterous boss, Sam (Kevin Bacon). So when a friend sees a photo of her taken at a friend's wedding with a friend of the groom's, she concludes that the two are a couple. Kate then invents a fictitious engagement to the man, Nick, (Jay Mohr)who she had never met before the wedding. It impresses her colleagues and bags her Sam. Kate pays Nick to pose as her fictitious man but her plan gets screwed up a little when he falls in love with her.I know that the advertising industry might be concerned with the 'image' of employees but I doubt that they would imply that being single and living with your mother meant that you had no career path. I'm pretty sure that you could sue for the implication that your love life and where you live prevents you from promotion. Anyway, the opposite tends to be true- the married couples are likely to leave and have children. Also, Kate must earn enough to get her own flat and surely if she's worked up to a good position in the company, she's got a bit of independence and drive? She seems to have quite a few psychological issues.Jennifer Aniston acquits herself well in a movie that probably is just a vehicle for her. Though if you don't think much of her, this film probably won't change your opinion. Kevin Bacon is actually quite good as Sam- and he makes a nice bit of eye candy, of course (though the hair is BAD). Jay Mohr doesn't have that much to do but he plays the cardboard cut-out nice guy quite sweetly.As I said previously, the plot has holes but in formulaic rom-coms this is sort of expected. However the comedy in this film is intermittent. It starts off as lightly amusing but this is abandoned for a more serious romantic tone (it's rather depressing in places as well), which spoils the fun a little, seeing as both Bacon and Aniston show that they could have handled a rom-com script. The soundtrack/score is pretty dull and a bit dated as well.If you're in the mood for a soppy non-taxing romance, this would do the job, and if you like the leading actors, it's worth a watch. If you like Maid in Manhatten, you'll probably like this as well (probably more). But if you're looking for a light rom-com, you might be disappointed.

But guess what &#150; for as hot as Aniston is, life just ain't picture perfect!  The independent lil' lady can't advance up the corporate ladder because she's unattached and has no liabilities, meaning she has no responsibilities, meaning she could leave the firm at the drop of a dime.  On top of everything else, Kate, tired of dating an endless stream of losers, falls for bad-boy co-worker Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon), who unfortunately only dates `unavailable' woman and finds Kate `too nice.'Her colleague Darcy O'Neal (Illeana Douglas) invents a fictional fiancee for Kate based on a silly, random photo taken with a Bostonian named Nick (Jerry McGuire's Jay Mohr) at a wedding the week before.  She's only met him once, as he was videotaping the wedding.   Frustrated with everything, Kate reluctantly goes along with the harebrained scheme and gets her promotion, as well as her man, for the previously unavailable Sam is suddenly attracted to the now officially-unavailable Kate.When controlling factors force Kate into generating her fiancee, she hunts Nick down and hires him for one evening to pose as her beloved.  He agrees, and the two create a past history for their relationship, as well as a convenient break-up that will take place during a business dinner with her boss. The catch?  Nick falls in love with Kate, Kate unknowingly falls in love with Nick, and Nick becomes uncomfortable with the whole facade.  We, the audience, are forced to root for Joe Ordinary (Mohr) over Joe Cool (Bacon), knowing that his hapless, hayseed schtick is probably three yawns too tired for a city-slicker like Aniston's character.

The chemistry between the cast is non-existent. The film reeks of 'could have been'. There's nothing funny about it. While I watched, I tried come up with things less amusing than this film; I couldn't think of a thing. Within the first thirty minutes or so, there's an ethnic wedding. Somehow, I felt that it was supposed to be funny, that I should laugh, but nothing about it was even remotely humorous. Early on, there's a scene where Aniston's character's boss tells her she needs to spend more money than she has if she wants a promotion. I couldn't help but be disgusted at this; in a country where a few people have almost all of the money and so many people have nothing at all, someone actually looks down who doesn't spend more than they need to. Worse even, this is passed off as humor. I felt like turning off the TV at that point, but due to my strong curiosity, in other words, my desire to find out if this garbage got any worse forced me to keep watching. Fortunately, it didn't, but I still couldn't muster up the effort to watch attentively after that first half hour. The plot is so stupid and far-fetched that it's almost a waste of space to put it in writing here, but I feel that I must warn others, deter them from watching this utter mess. Aniston, as just mentioned, can't get a promotion if she doesn't start spending more money. Her friend knows this, so she does what any sensible person would do for their best friend... she uses a big, fat lie to get her the promotion. She tells the boss that Aniston is engaged to be wed. Apparently, this also makes her attractive to a guy she's in love with... like I said, I didn't pay much attention to it. Not much else to say... the acting is fair. Jay Mohr(who I am a fairly big fan of, and because of whom I watched the film at all) does very good, as usual. The film isn't really worth watching, for any reason at all.

It's easy to overlook all the flaws in this movie and just watch it and go with the flow.Incidentally, if there were such an award as an anti-Oscar, it would go to costume designer Jane Robinson. At one point Aniston is told by the agency director to buy a new dress before attending an important party. Aniston arrives at the party in an ill-fitting outfit that makes her look like a hooker. Did Ms. Robinson ever hear of the little black dress?

Actually it's kind of dull. I think the premise was good but what were supposed to be the movie's funnier aspects weren't funny. Hence, my attention wandered and I didn't really get into it like I wanted.I also think Anniston was miscast-there are many who would argue the role is similar to Rachel on Freinds and thats just the point. We've already seen this person-once a week for years-Anniston's a good actress and she should keep playing against type like good girl or even Her role in Bruce Almighty which was more sweet then funny. Here, it's just Rachel starring as herself-not Anniston's fault-the movie should also have been funnier-the idea was funny in itself and the scenes were a bit flat and forced when they could have been kooky and fresh. I wouldn't give this past a 5 of 10.

Jay Mohr gets to play the hired dunce.  Kevin Bacon plays the cool dude who only digs chicks who have beaus.  Of course, Jennifer Aniston gets to play the girl in the middle.  Well, so the story unfolds.  Unfortunately for us, we don't really care about the characters because face it, even if Aniston and Bacon are in their corporate office, our real lives just might be more interesting. After all, the office gossip is sure more entertaining when its REAL rather than fictitious as here portrayed.  But the film has some appeal.  Mohr is a nice fit as Aniston's fake boyfriend until we begin to wonder, is she really that cruel after all?  Well...Jennifer Aniston is a babe.  And even if this and Object weren't prizes, its fun watching a hot brod for two hours on a screen rather than having to endure the not funny Carrot Top and Norm MacDonald.  That's this reporter's view anerhow.

If it weren't for her 'Friends' success, I would guess that she wouldn't have a whole lot of luck with her movie career in Hollywood.  'Picture Perfect' is a simple comedy that is somewhat entertaining, but nothing to brag about.Jennifer Aniston is a good actress.  I will admit that.  And the main reason that she is one is because of her TV fame.  Who cares, I like her, so whatever.  She does a great job in this role.  Well, I might want to tone it down a notch.  Jay Mohr is also pretty good.  I can't say that I like Mohr, but in the few films that I have seen him in, he was fairly decent.  Kevin Bacon, who has a very small role, is okay, I suppose.  Neither of the guys are fantastic, but they aren't that bad.  The plot is a little out there; it could use some work on.  Actually, it's particularly dumb, but I'm not that bored with it.  The writing is average.  Is it even supposed to be a comedy?  It is?  Well, it isn't too funny.  I really didn't laugh at all, come to think about it.  So, 'Picture Perfect' isn't bad or anything, it's just ho-hum.  If you like Aniston, what the heck, go out and rent this.  I would, however, recommend 'The Object of My Affection' as opposed to telling someone to see this.  They both have a little deja vu going on for me for some reason, but I'd say go see 'Object' instead of this. "},{"Title":"Above average romcom fare","Date":"20 February 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Jennifer Aniston is more than capable of pulling off the role required of her here - a character in the style favoured by many romcoms as their central figure, pretty and nice enough but a little self-centred, ready for the lesson in life that leads them into the happy relationship at the end. Though not adding much to the other movie and tv roles she has tried out, she stands up well and seems just as comfortable on the big screen as on the small. Splendid support is provided by more experienced movie players Kevin Bacon and Ileanna Douglas, and Jay Mohr is good enough as Bacon's nicer rival (mmm, who will win the day and the girl I wonder). A reasonable script provides just enough laughs, tension and romance to please most fans of the genre, and though it runs a little long the complex web Aniston weaves round herself is more than enough to keep the viewer's interest. Few superlatives here then, but there is little or nothing in this film deserving of criticism, which makes for a pleasant change in a genre that produces more than its fair share of stale, turgid clones. Well worth watching for the romcom crowd, and Aniston's fans will surely adore everysecond she's on the screen.

Jennifer Aniston plays a hysterical and less likeable version of her character in Friends.  Kevin Bacon is very weak in his role and completely unbelievable as a man that Jennifer would fall for.  This is probably billed as a romantic comedy but I found very little evidence of romance (particularly in Jennifer's role) although there were some humourous moments.  Worth watching if you're a couch potatoe, otherwise forget it!

Basically at Mercer Advertising, single Kate Mosley (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to build up to a better career at the company, and even when suggesting a great and chosen idea for a campaign, isn't promoted. Then she finds a way to get the promotion she wants, when people see her in a photo with some guy at a wedding party, she never corrects anyone about being engaged to him. Kate's new and better career seems to be going great, and she is spending her money on lots of luxury and convenience, she even manages to bed her crush, Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon). But then her boss Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn) wants to meet the guy, Nick (Jay Mohr), and he manages to track him down, and pays him to go along with her plan to have dinner and meet everyone, and quickly break up. He is willing to go along with the plan at first, but it is obvious the few days before it happens, he develops real affection for her, and she is forced into making the break-up happen. Obviously they get back together again before he has to go away, but as is predictable, in the end she goes to a wedding he is filming, expresses her (real) feelings for him, and they have their happy ending hug and kiss. Also starring Steel Magnolias' Olympia Dukakis as Rita Mosley, Cape Fear's Illeana Douglas as Darcy O'Neil, Anne Twomey as Sela and Faith Prince as Mrs. Mercer. The story may be predictable mostly, and even on the preposterous side, but Aniston (in her days of Friends' success) is likable, and it is a good-natured romantic comedy. Worth watching!

If movies were like hamburgers I could just send this movie back to the kitchen, say,  Hey, cook it this time and don't drop it on the floor.  Customer Service, it's important. I don't want to buy a f*cked up hamburger. Let's take a step back, get some perspective- impossible billions of years unfolded without our knowing to have the end result of us here and now on planet Earth, and we are still without knowledge, and also we made this movie. Each of us had a hand in it, we kissed Jennifer Aniston's ass and we told her she should be in a movie and she agreed, and now, all the people who have been born after this movie was made, part of them was made by this movie, part of the reason why they were born is because of this movie, I mean if you want to look at the whole totality of existence thing what with all possible matter and energy in the universe being interconnected and whatnot.
