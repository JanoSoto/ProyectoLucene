I enjoyed the watching the entire alien ecosystem evolve.Fortunately, I'm the kind of person that understands a movie made to be predominantly a comedy doesn't require scientific accuracy, nor should the audience expect it. It was intentionally silly.One last thing. I thought David Duchovny did a great job playing a character that had a wry, dry sense of humor. He wasn't exactly a straight man, but it was clear to me, he was laughing at the world.Rating, I gave it 8/10 because it entertained me AND my wife, something many movies can't do.

I anticipated another lame comedy and a cheap imitation of Men in Black.  Evolution can be compared to MIB in certain aspects, but it breaks new ground.I can't give a really scientific review, because quite frankly I was too busy laughing to weigh out the pros and cons.  This is a great popcorn movie!  (Metaphorically speaking, I was eating nachos) There are scary moments involving slimy creatures, so chances are if there are any females with you--they will be clinging onto your arms.  Ivan Reitman is the famed director of the Ghostbusters movies, and Evolution has much of the same charm and quirky sense of style and humor.  David Duchovny (who really has a good sense of humor off-camera, but happens to get stuck with mostly serious roles) is terrific in a looser role that enables him to flaunt his knack for comedy.  Of course, Orlando Jones is the funniest in the bunch.  He has a terrific scene in which a bug crawls inside his skin and doctors have to get it out...rectally.  I have to say, that was the highlight of this offbeat comedy and had me on the floor!  Julianne Moore plays the clumsy assistant.  I can't say I found her role all that humorous.  Her pratfalls are pretty lame and predictable.  But that minor hint of cheap slapstick didn't ruin the overall experience. Evolution is great fun from start to finish (a very interesting finish with an innovative product placement)!  Sure, it's all low-brow, but it works and the crude humor is tamed down to a tolerant level (Well, compared to the average contemporary comedy).  This is not a movie to be studied or analyzed or discussed for hours at a time.  Just sit back and HAVE SOME FUN!!!  Because chances are (considering previous 2001 releases) you won't be having this much fun at the movies in quite a while.  I could be wrong, but better to be safe than sorry.My score  7 (out of 10)   "},{"Title":"Great Googa Mooga!","Date":"11 June 2001","Score":"92 out of 126 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Okay, this may surprise you, but, this film is way better than every one says it is.

A story about aliens with humor, not bad. Then when I read that Ivan Reitman, the BEST comedic director of the 80's and one of the best of all time was at the helm, I was thrilled.  I mean, come on, after he was given duds like `Father's Day' and `Six Days, Seven Nights' to work with, isn't it about time that Hollywood gave him a project worth while (I won't even mention the bombastic disaster of `Junior'&#133;oh, I just did)?It begins with the introduction of Scott's character, Wayne Green, a wannabe fireman practicing for his fireman final (questionable at first, hilarious in the end).  Then he gets an unexpected visitor - a meteor, carrying alien organisms hits the heart of the Arizona desert. After a community college science professor, Ira Kane Duchovny, working with one screwed up screen name)and his eccentric geologist buddy, Harry Block (Jones) discover the meteor, they find that the `bleeding' rock starts to create these weird alien creatures and soon they begin to multiply.  Kane's nemeses, Gen. Woodman (Levine) and the military get involved, things get too out-of-control, so it's up to the teaming of Kane, Block, Green and government scientist Allison Reed (Moore) to stop the evolution.If you're a Reitman fan, the plot of this could make you go in expecting some kind of tribute to both `Ghostbusters'.  In a way it is, and is that a bad thing?  Hell no!  If you liked, or even loved (like me) `Ghostbusters', I can bet my clean pair of boxers that you'll get a hoot out of `Evolution'. But of course any film must maintain some distance from the films its being compared too, and `Evolution' does that.  The characters and situations are different, atmospherically.  Duchovny turns in a `cool' performance, by that meaning he wasn't Mr. Badass or Mr. Laugh-a-Minute, he was just, well, Duchovny and that itself is always pleasing to watch.  Jones is his usual funny self, delivering some funny lines. Moore's ability to do just about anything comes in handy here, playing the hottie-yet-clumsy love interest. Scott's acting resembles the other roles he's done in the past, and I've come to appreciate that (that thing he does w/ his eyebrow is getting funnier every time).  Can't say the same for Levine; his clich√© performance as the bad-guy-who-doesn't-listen character gets annoying fast.A lot of the film makes me question what it is, and really what it could have been.  The script, penned by three writers, was originally written as a sci-fi THRILLER, not a sci-fi comedy.  There were a lot of laughs, but because of the script's origin, there could have been more.  But considering the script was originally a sci-fi thriller, the filmmakers, including Reitman, did a great job.  Can't say much for the ending, though the ending looks and feels like a meshed-up result of what-could-have-been, and from that mushiness, the filmmakers poked at and took at least some of the good elements.  Thank god the film is a comedy; if it was its original idea, the ending would have been disastrous.`Evolution' is a overall crowd-pleaser with nice special effects and makeup (those dead aliens looked great).  It's a few laughs and comedic situations short of comedic greatness, but look on the bright side-Reitman is back in his lovable kick-ass form.  He's tapped into the present and how most comedies are made, but he didn't dare forget his roots there is a sequence in the film where Duchovny, Jones and Scott chase down a flying creature in a mall.  The three, equipped with shotguns, dispose of it in true Ghostbusters style.  And with me being a big Ghostbusters fan, I fell in love with the it, plus its the best scene in the film. (The trio singing after their battle; nice touch).GRADE B+ "},{"Title":"Hilarious","Date":"9 June 2001","Score":"57 out of 82 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  It has been ages since I've seen a movie that I laughed so hard it brought tears to my eyes, this one did.

Some of the gags are somewhat overused, such as Julianne Moore's CDC scientist's clumsiness, but the rest of the movie easily overshadows these blemishes.In his first few scenes, Scott's acting seems absolutely awful, but that quickly disappears (and I have no explanation for it whatsoever).  Unfortunately I think he is working towards the typecast of young, doofus goofball.  Hopefully he can get around that in the future.David Duchovny gives a very refreshing performance, breaking out of his usually dapper moods as Fox Mulder.

It is always nice to see Julianne Moore and she shows her comic side at its best.  Her portrayal of Alison Reed, the clumsy scientist from the Center for Disease Control, is probably her best comedic turn to date. David Duchovny is out chasing aliens again and, in some ways, spoofs his `X-Files' character; he was a good bit of casting.  He has good comic timing and his deadpan delivery is perfect for the character.  He and Ms Moore have good screen chemistry and it would be nice to see them together again.More directors need to think of Orlando Jones when casting films&#133;  He really can act and, while the material in `Evolution' doesn't offer too many opportunities to do so, he takes the chances he is given and runs with them.  Seann William Scott (Wayne Green) has the &#145;not-too-bright good guy' role down letter-perfect.  He has some of the better lines in the movie and, remembering that this is a farce, is probably the most believable character in the movie.The location photography is, at times, dazzling; however, some of the special effects looked very cheesy &#150; very obvious &#145;green screen' shots &#150; so obvious that I wondered if they were bad on purpose.

I guess I never got in on the bandwagon on that one.  I never found it to be as funny as a lot of people (tons of people actually) found it.  I thought parts of it were cool (like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man), but most of the movie was too drab for me, for some reason.  Someday I'll write a review of it, but I'm too lazy to do it right now.  Why am I talking about Ghostbusters when I'm reviewing Evolution, some of you ask?  Well, it's simple.  The same man directs both movies (Ivan Reitman) and both movies have very similar plots.  Except that, in my opinion, Evolution is better.  Basically, think of Evolution as a remake of Ghostbusters only throw out the ghosts and put in aliens, which I like because aliens, in my opinion, are cooler and more realistic than ghosts.Let me mention some bad stuff, just to get it over with because I have to do at some point.  This movie misses some serious opportunities to be funny.  Sometimes, when you are expecting a joke, there is none.  It's almost as if they really weren't trying.  Sometimes the jokes are a little corny.One last bad note some of the aliens suck.  The ending alien is a bit of a let down.  It kind of reminded me of Akira, if you've seen that movie.  There is also this cute alien who turns out to be nasty via the mouth within a mouth, a la Ridley Scott's Alien.Now on to some good stuff.  This movie is really funny in a happy kind of way.  I compare the mood of this movie to another Dreamworks alien-comedy, Galaxy Quest (a movie I thought was hilarious).  If you liked Galaxy Quest, and I think most people did, then you will like Evolution.Something else I would like to point out is how scientific Evolution is.  The movie seems very intelligent as far as talking about how the aliens evolve.  I for one and happy to see a movie that isn't completely dumbed down for the uneducated.  I like alien stuff and space stuff, so this kind of science interests me.  Overall, I found Evolution to be very intriguing apart from being funny.Oh, I want to mention Orlando Jones.  He's the black guy from those 7-Up commercials.  I love this guy.  He steals the show in this movie.  I knew the guy was great ever since I saw the first of those 7-Up commercials.  He was also in the Replacements (that lame football comedy which was also somewhat entertaining), and he's probably been in some other stuff I haven't seen or can't remember.  But let me tell you, this guy is going places.  As for the other actors, they're decent.  I like the touch of having David Duchovny on board.  Julian Moore is a good actress, but she got shafted in the character department.  She has a basic walking cardboard cutout character with little personality.  Oh well.In conclusion, please do me a favor of not going into this movie expecting a great movie.  Why do people do that?  Every movie can't be the Godfather or 2001 or Saving Private Ryan, so why don't you just shut up and enjoy the movie.  You won't look back at Evolution at the end of the summer as you favorite summer movie this year, but you're not supposed to.  Evolution was made to be entertaining, not great.  It was made to give you your money's worth and put forth an enjoyable show.

This is to say that a different set of principals are brought to bear on the subject matter. I'm sure that other in the U.S and around the world will(and have)expressed opinions, but this one comes from a whole other country. Evolution is a very enjoyable film. It has been made in a summer of super event movies, and film/game conversions and I feel stands alone as the only comedy with an original source material (in sci-fi anyway).It is highly enjoyable. If you're paying 5 pounds (or $8.50) you need to find a film that refreshes your sentiments with regards to just what a big money film should be. As I sit here smoking a cigarette and drinking a 7up, I figure this film to be a winner. The principals act in a manner appropriate to the subject material, and although Mr. Duchovny is not a comedy actor, I feel he acquits himself admirably in an unfamiliar field. Mr. Jones is a relative newcomer to the cinema, and I reckon that over time he may very well ascend to the the same esteemed level as Eddie Murphy, or his latterday composite (of sorts) Will Smith.The plot is most sound, and although it draws some comparisons to Ghostbusters as other critics have noted, it stands alone as Summer 2001's most original comedy event movie. Mr Reitman, a veteran knows how to make films play easily, is one of the few directors who knows how to use good comedy actors. With this in mind, no one is underused, perhaps with the one exception of Mr. Dan Aykroyd, nowadays underrated for some insane reason, but who is extremely talented. It's a shame that Aykroyd's presence as a big man is more valued then his acting talent, because he's always a delight to watch.To cut in some sourness, there's not a lot of involvement with the central characters, and you do find yourself watching people being cheated into a state of reaction at the expense of the colourful effects, but that's the way it was made, and we can't change that.In all I would recommend this film to the less morose viewer, as it's cheerful, colourful, and does not require an over-critical view.

I missed this film in the Theatre, I should have gone.David Duchovny parodies his own Fox Mulder character in this 2001 Ivan Reitman extravaganza- It's Amazing, how every Reitman film follows a kind of formula Which was laid down in the first Ghostbusters movie. We have the two Academics - Ira Caine (Duchovny) and Harry Block (Orlando Jones) - Then there are a few kids under their tutelage - Then there is the Loser (Originally, the Lewis character in Ghostbusters)- Here, that is played out by Seann William Scott. Reitman always has the Loser character redeem themselves, which Scott does with his Bird Call and Singing to an air-breathing alien in an enclosed shopping mall.An Asteroid falls to the earth, right on top of Scott's Blow-Up Doll as he practices his would-be firefighting skills in the desert of Arizona. Harry Block is the local USGS investigator, he Clicked over to the USGS site while looking at Girls Volley Ball Team Photos- As he needs an actual scientist to help him figure it out, he endorses the help of his friend, Chemistry Professor Ira Caine who has a sordid past with The Pentagon.They discover some unusual things with the Asteroid, but in true Reitman fashion, the US Army (by keeping tabs on Caine's Computer) moves in and takes over the whole operation.But they are screwing it up, and it is up to Caine and Block, with the help of CDC Specialist and Ice Maiden Allison Reed (Julian Moore who is an obvious parody of Dana Scully) to set things straight - If not, the rapidly evolving Aliens will soon spread across the world within a matter of days! Reitman films start small- and get Big, and then even Bigger - The Stay Puft Marshmallow man? There is a version of that in this film as well! Reitman sticks to his formula, and it works here.This movie moves fast, so if you turn your head, you miss key information. But it is not that hard to keep your eyes glued to the boob tube in this one. There is some great Location work, and lots of great Character Actors with typically Reitman dialog. Especially from Sarah Silverman who plays Caine's former girlfriend, and who is still wearing his SHIRT - And tries to give it back to Caine in the middle of a restaurant!As a Science Fiction story, there is an interesting thing about Life Forms based on Selenium. So naturally, which shampoo would you use to kill them? Duchovny pulls out all the stops and no part of Fox Mulder is sacred as he rips The X Files a new belly-hole.Actually this film runs quite a bit like the Comedy X-Files episodes, like Dreamland I and II. Like Ghostbusters, what begins with two guys (Caine and Block) rapidly becomes a small Team - First the addition of Scott as a Sidekick and wanna-be Fireman, then Moore adds her expertise, and finally, the two heavy Kids, the football Players from Caine's Chemistry Class join the club - And THEN and ONLY THEN is this unlikely team of heroes ready to save the world as we know it!One More Word - Duchovny Turned Down an opportunity to be in the 2nd Prequel Star Wars Trilogy Film - And this was a good move on his part, because as low rated as this film is, THIS film IS Duchovny. Just like Playing God - There are certain movies Duchovny does good in, and this was one. So I give him my HIGH respect for choosing this role over the obvious easy money role Lucas would have tossed him.After you watch this film - LET'S SHAMPOO US SOME ALIENS!

Soon the new life-forms begin to evolve and start to get more and more dangerous. It's now up to the two professors to save the planet.Ivan Reitman is back with another wonderful sci-fi film which can be watched as a family. The script has been carefully written, with the inclusion of scientific terms but with a story which can be easily understood. The special effects in the film are actually very good. Some of the aliens look beautifully made, and sometimes look realistic. The cast of the film look like they are having a blast whilst filming, with a great appearance from Dan Akroyd.

I knew nothing about Orlando Jones, but Seann William Scott is a young actor on the Teen Movie scene. I loved American Pie and Road Trip. Indeed, Evolution tries to use the Teen feel, as the original scenes are based around two college lecturers in an American High School. The school jokes come thick and fast at the start, but they are are original and funny. On the whole I have to say that much of this film left me in stitches. It's easy humour with Dan Ayckroyd thrown in. Ted Levine (The cross dressing Psychopath from Silence of the Lambs) is disturbing in a comedy role, but he just about gets away with it, in his foil role in this film, playing the bad guy against the rapid fire wit. Obviously, Duchovny is used to ham up his X Files role, which he does very successfully. It's often hard not to imagine Moore with her kit off in Boogie Nights, but not to bad as the first time I've seen her in a comedy role. On the whole, I laughed a lot. It's a mickey take, it's Caddyshack, it's a teen movie mixed with Sci Fi idiocy. Try comparing it with Galaxy Quest, another film I found to be amusing and thoroughly absorbing.

This sophomoric aliens-vs.-humans comedy with X-Files defector David Duchovny battling carnivorous extraterrestrials never evolves beyond its amoebic humor, its cretinous characters, and its Petri dish deep plot. Indeed, campy 1950s B-movie sci-fi classics, like The Giant Gila Monster or The Killer Shrews, deliver more laughs per minute than this feeble, uninspired potboiler. Okay, some of the gross-out gags may prompt a snicker, but you won't split your sides howling with hilarity like you might have done at Reitman's original Ghostbusters. Imagine a Ghostbusters trio of heroes combating aliens gone AWOL from Men In Black, Tremors, Gremlins, and Jurassic Park, and you have a fairly accurate idea how wholly derivative and hopelessly predictable this lame creature feature is. Basically, Reitman stages these life and death exploits as if they constituted multi-million dollar Saturday Night Live skits.The prefabricated screenplay by Don (Vampires) Jakoby, David (The Family Man) Diamond, & David Weissman opens one night when goofy firefighter wannabe, Wayne Green (Sean William Scott of American Pie), sets an empty shack ablaze in the desert and practices his rescue routine with a life-sized female dummy. Suddenly, a fiery meteor plunges from the heavens, obliterates the shack, hurls Wayne's car two hundred feet into the sky, and crashes out-of-sight in a cavern! Duchovny stars as Professor Ira Kane, a disgraced ex-Army scientist now teaching biology at Glen Canyon Community College in Arizona. It seems the Pentagon gave Ira the boot after platoons of troops contracted dire side effects like diarrhea, blindness, facial paralysis, and hair loss when he inoculated them. Meanwhile, Kane's colleague Professor Harry Block (Orlando Jones) divides his time between geology lectures and coaching the girls' volleyball team. Kane and Block gather asteroid samples. Staring into a microscope, an alarmed Kane watches these single-cell organisms evolve at an unearthly rate. Kane tells Block What took us 200 million years has taken them only a few hours. Without warning, the U.S. Army commandeers the investigation, banishes our protagonists from the premises, confiscates their research, and summons attractive CDC epidemiologist Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore of Hannibal) who has a clumsy habit of falling down wherever she walks. Gradually, the slimy creatures acclimate themselves to Earth's ecosystem and behave like predators. Despicable Army General Russell Woodman (Ted Levine of Silence of the Lambs) decides to napalm them. Unfortunately, our heroes learn too late these monsters react to napalm like Gremlins to bathing after midnight.Not only does David Duchovny lack Bill Murray's comedic genius, but also he cannot pass up any opportunity to spoof his Agent Mulder persona. Meanwhile, Orlando Jones of Bedazzled suffers a far worse fate. He submits reluctantly to an anal probe when an alien burrows under his skin, then later finds himself administering a shampoo enema to a gargantuan monster to destroy it! Evolution really hits rock bottom with its shameless product placement for Head & Shoulders!Sci-fi comedy takes several steps backward with Evolution.

The result of their experiment bring horrible consequences for the nearby city.Ira Kane discovers in his microscope the ability of the liquid taken from the space rock to mutate into million cells rapidly.

The only positive thing in the arriving force is Allison Reed, who soon after the arrival realizes the big problem posed by the creatures that begin appearing all over the place.Evolution turns out to be fun for a while, but it is just another predictable movie that in the end relies on special effects, but no real smarts. One thing though, the creatures designed by Phil Tippet are perfectly creepy and menacing. The best sequence of the entire film has to be a fly-like monster that enters the skin of Harry Block and one sees it move under it. The creature moves all over his body under the skin and we watch its shape perfectly. The only way this thing out is to go through a part of his anatomy and involves the use of a device that is too painful to describe. David Duchovny and Orlando Bloom do a good job with their roles.

Even Baby Geniuses wasn't this bad. Duchovny's comic timing is terrible, and the witty repartee that one normally finds in buddy movies such as this is completely lacking between Duchovny and Orlando Jones; it's absolutely amazing, watch this movie and you'll see that there is zero chemistry between the main characters. I wonder if this was deliberate.Here's one reason this movie doesn't make any sense a meteor crashes to earth and a community college instructor and his buddy discover that life is evolving from the meteor. So now that the most astounding scientific discovery in thousands of years has happened right under their noses, what happens? They casually go about their normal routine, taking students on a field trip to visit the meteor, sitting around chatting, basically ignorant of the miracle that is happening under their very noses. It's so stupid, it just wouldn't happen like this unless the main characters were made out to be stupid in the first place, but Reitman doesn't take this angle. He plays it seriously like a black comedy, but then pulls out something stupid like the golf course dude falling asleep at his fireman exam. The characters aren't well defined at all. Why should I care about any of them, Reitman doesn't take the time to flesh them out, he seems to be ridiculing their superficiality while simultaneously starving them of the witty dialogue necessary to pull off a black comedy. The result is a mishmash of facial expressions and clich√©s mined from one hundred years of comedy and vaudeville, all thrown together in an attempt to get something to stick. It's like taking everything in your refrigerator and mixing it all together and hoping it will taste good.It doesn't.I'll echo the sentiments of another reviewer who said the film lost him when they were taking the mosquito thing out of Jones. If that isn't bad enough, Jones hops up and threatens the doctor never to do that again. So? Next time the doctor will just leave the insect inside of him? This movie is painfully stupid.

With big names of serious cinema like David Duchovny of X-Files fame and Julianne Moore of Psycho and Hannibal fame, a comedy of this kind was nice treat for sure.The peaceful town Glenn Canyon in Arizona suddenly becomes a hotbed of activity as a meteorite crashes in the nearby desert. Local science teachers, Ira Kane a disgraced Army Colonel and researcher played by David Duchovny and Harry Block steal a sample from the meteorite and find unusual cellular activity and quickened evolution.

The best comic though comes on screen when Ted Livine better known for his role of Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs plays General Woodman who leads the Military to cordon off the area and nuke the evolving creatures. He is assisted by a pretty scientist Allison Reed (Julianne Moore).While the movie shows a host of dinosaurs and humanoid chimps that involve a good amount of work with graphics, they are not as scary as a typical Jurassic Park or a Godzilla movie. The fun here is more in the nature of Ghostbusters where ghouls are not really scary and the heroes ward them off. By the time you reach the end of the movie, you just realize that your regular head and shoulders shampoo has new uses too!This movie may have hit screens and gone away without much fanfare but makes a regular appearance on Television. Evolution shows the non-serious face of David Duchovny although he deals with a seemingly dangerous situation on hand.

Secondly, the humor within the movie is great. The scene in the cave with Duchovny and Jones is perhaps my favorite, simply because of the spontanuity behind it. Sometimes that's the funniest thing.Furthermore, I think the special effects in this movie should NOT go unrecognized. Granted, it's a comedy, and the last thing you're really watching for are special effects. I mean, it isn't like this movie is going to compare with Star Wars or something, but it certainly carries some amazing effects. For example, anyone who has seen the movie can tell you that the primate should be in some terror movie that you tell your kids about and warn them never to see. For a comedy, I can remember shuddering in my seat after seeing that thing. But they give you some comic relief after, which I won't state in case you want to see the movie! But, even more importantly for the special effects are the creatures. They LOOK almost real, well, most of them anyway. You can almost envision yourself stepping outside and seeing them!Lastly, the movie definitely provides an understandable plot. I will admit, frankly, that it is probably the movies weakest element. You feel little knowledge over the outline of the movie. BUT, it is strong enough that you can follow, and in a comedy, that's all you need. I mean, lets be honest here, who really cares how Austin Powers ends, right? You just want to hear the lines and see Heather Graham/Elizabeth Hurley, right? Well, same thing here.

"},{"Title":"Evolution","Date":"21 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" Goofy sci-fi spoof set in an Arizona community college desert town has two scientists (David Duchovny and Orlando Bloom) discovering a variety of alien lifeforms evolving into scary monsters at an alarming rate, deciding it would be best to kill them before the extinction of the human race. How to do that? Head and Shoulders shampoo, of course! Duchovny gets to riff his X-Files image and is comfortably relaxed as a ladies' man with a rather unfortunate history regarding his work at the Pentagon&#x85;which a former associate, General Woodman (Ted Levine; Silence of the Lambs, Monk), likes to remind him of. Bloom coaches girl basketball, must endure a rectal removal of an alien fly, and seems to be having fun as Duchovny's wise-cracking sidekick&#x85;certainly hard to forget is how Bloom is literally sucked into the anus of a giant alien monster! Seann William Scott, obviously cast due to his Stiffler character from the American Pie movies of the time, is a fireman wannabe who assists the scientists in trying to stop the aliens from evolving into a menace that would destroy all of mankind. Julianne Moore is another military scientist that eventually sides with Duchovny and Bloom after initially being on the side of Levine. Dan Aykroyd is the Arizona governor and Sarah Silverman is a former lover of Duchovny's. As you might expect, Moore and Duchovny (Moore being a redhead has a special irony to it, considering Gillian Anderson was opposite Duchovny on the X-Files) eventually hit it off. The obvious ending Ghost Busters homage is hard not to notice. Some cool special effects giving life to the aliens add substantially to the spoof; this might make a fun companion piece to Mars Attacks. The comedy aims to please and perhaps tries just a bit too hard, but I guess it succeeds more than fails. I thought William Scott was rather inconsequential to the film, lightening up his usual shtick and offering a rather dimbulb bimbo who is all gung-ho to help the scientists. A type of winged dinosaur flying through a mall could be the special effects highlight, but there is an underground cavern that becomes its own alien world which gives it a run for its money. Moore was about to move on from this kind of movie to focus on far more dramatic work. Bloom's asking for his leg to be removed before the fly inside his body reaches his testicles should get a good laugh. There's plenty of winking in Duchovny's performance which signifies that he (nor us should) doesn't take this seriously at all.

Every single joke fails. Every single moment fails - every feeling or response the film (presumably) intended to elicit from a viewer, it fails to elicit. None of the performances is any good, but you can't even blame them because there was just nothing at all to work with. These aren't even characters. The 'relationships' and pretty much every single thing that occurs in the film, is given such short shrift, is told so abruptly, that none of it can possibly pay off or work. We're in the middle of this thing and Julianne Moore's character (the whole character consists of a profession and an exaggerated clumsiness) starts talking deeply and familiarly to Duchovny's character, as if they've shared some great film flirtation and relationship prior to that, and we were seeing the latest episode in this great antagonistic flirtation - except no, they'd had like one scene together before then and had barely even talked. The whole movie's like that. And the jokes, or the humor - I mean just nothing works. You just have to guess where the humor was meant to be, so little is it actually there. Like, you have to try to figure what in a given scene or moment or interaction could have been meant to be funny. It's just terrible, scene for scene, shot for shot, moment for moment, joke for joke. A bad, bad movie. Also, there's one scene that I found especially hilarious (not on purpose). The guys have just killed the thing at the mall, and then there's just the most inexplicable little interlude I've ever seen in a movie - they cut to the trio in a jeep driving home, and they're all loudly singing Play that funky music white boy while doing like Night at the Roxbury head dancing. It's a complete non sequitur. It follows from nothing. Nothing follows from it. It isn't funny. It isn't interesting. Well, it's kind of interesting, as an object. But not interesting in the context of the story. So. Yea I just have no idea. I have no idea what this movie was even supposed to be. I regret having seen it but I'm proud I finished it.Oh I almost forgot - the Ghostbusters references. And honestly, in retrospect, maybe the entire movie was a Ghostbusters reference or an attempt to recapture that magic (this film DID succeed in recapturing the 'magic' of Ghostbusters 2, imo). OK, so Dan Aykroyd shows up as the governor and does his usual thing, and then - there's just a Ghostbusters scene. I mean Reitman basically just throws up a Ghostbusters scene, except with a much worse script and horrible characters in a horrible movie with horrible performers. The scene it's copying is the Ghostbusters scene where the EPA guy and the Ghostbusters are arguing in front of the mayor of NYC. In this film it's Ted Levine's general as the EPA guy, the good guys as the Ghostbusters, and Aykroyd as the mayor. It was weird. Just really weird. I dunno. If I've made this movie sound at all interesting or worth investigating, I apologize. It's not interesting. Don't see it. Watch something else.

The plot is simple and will seem very familiar. There's nothing special about the script or acting. But it is a fun movie, mostly on two scores. The first is the bumbling and fumbling that Julianne Moore's character, Allison does. The usually serious Moore adds something to this film in her unusual straight-faced clumsiness.The second thing that boosts the film to above boredom is the monster, or monsters. The sci-fi aspects of Evolution are excellent. The special effects and/or CGI in this film are very good. It's not a scary movie, but one of those sort of tongue-in-cheek sci-fi action films. The terror or fright of a serious sci-fi film is replaced here by a bemusing humor at the antics and attacks of the creatures. Indeed, those will get more laughs than the lame lines of the two male lead characters, Ira and Harry. I wouldn't run out and buy this film, but it's worth watching if it plays on TV or if one can find it somewhere for a few bucks.

As I've continued to watch subsequent viewings of Evolution, I've come to appreciate the movie for what it is.  Instead of a relatively light-weight, entertaining hilarious comedy, Evolution is more of a dry humor, characteristic of David Duchovny and similar in tone to the wry humor in Lake Placid (1999) where Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda are confronted with a monstrous allegator menacing the populace of Lake Placid.

Therefore, I'm not surprised to read here that Ivan Reitman turned a straight sci-fi plot into a unrepentant series of butt gags.Let me cut straight to the chase not once did EVOLUTION make me so much as 'crack' a smile. It's a movie that oozes gooey potential; potential that is ultimately wasted on anal humor.One of the strongest aspects of GHOSTBUSTERS was the chemistry among the cast members. There is no such discernable chemistry between David Duchovny (who's about as funny as a hunk of steel wool) and Orlando Jones. And when that chemistry fails (which is quite often), the film descends into a stream of uncomfortably forced racial humor reminiscent of WILD WILD WEST with Wil Smith and Kevin Kline. Oh, and did I mention the anal jokes?On the positive side, the special effects are wonderful ... the critters steal the show. The basic plot is also compelling.EVOLUTION is a failure, but it's an interesting failure. I found it amusing to hear Reitman remark on the DVD how the strength of the film was its comedy; it reminded me of listening to George Lucas insist on the Phantom Menace DVD that Jar Jar is the key to the whole movie.EVOLUTION could have been a classic had the story fell into a different pair of hands.

I had only seen Shawn in Road Trip and enjoyed that as well. A meteor has hit earth and aliens are inside. Starting as small as a cell, these aliens go from dog-like to slug-like. Two college professors, a wannabe fireman, and an FBI agent try and stop earth from being overrun by aliens.  Overall this movie impressed me. All the actors did well with their characters. David had said he wouldnt have done Evolution if it wasnt a comedy. Supriseingly David is a very funny actor. I always knew him as a drama kind of guy. Moore's character was a beautiful and clumsy Humorless Ice Queen in need of a good humping.

If you still can't believe some room for humour here, just take my word.There are some crude jokes, especially targetting an embarrassingly clumsy Moore. There is the usual love angle, which is half-baked and unnecessary.Duchovny (X-Files) and Moore (Hannibal, The Lost World) are just adequate; their roles are certainly not upto their potential.

It was a reasonably funny comedy-cheap-sci-fi type-film, if one is to sum it up. At times, it was unfunny in the cynical, gross-out style, but enough laughs were raised through some amusing moments. The idea of having Julianne Moore as a slapstick sideshow was embarrassingly executed, however; not funny, just ungainly, and even less funny when done for the tenth time... Moore does not impress at all here, not judging the comedy correctly at all, and failing to add a compelling straight performance either. David Duchovny hardly gives a great comic performance, but is passable, totally underplaying his role as a questionable scientist. I was quite impressed with Orlando Jones, who did have some grasp of comic timing, and around whom most of the humour was centered. Dan Aykroyd's appearance, and one or two other roles, were superfluous though.  I thought perhaps the way it ended was a little too manipulatively ironic and, while the final commercial is lightly amusing, one didn't expect it to be literalised, when after the film, Head and Shoulders took the chance to use an outgoing movie crowd as literally a free market for its product. The film is enjoyable stuff for the most part, but I don't suspect it would at all hold up well to subsequent viewings.

Now I don't mind the odd knowing wink or sly dig at a genre or series of movies, but when you decide to rip off wholesale what already has been a winning formula and just give it another title that is when I get a little annoyed.Evolution, if you haven't already worked it out from the trailers and publicity, is pretty much a rehash of the Ghostbusters formula.  Which is not surprising considering the creative team behind the two films.So in Evolution we have a group of misfits out to save the world from the dirty aliens.  A meteorite crashes in the desert and begins to spawn off an amazing variety of nasty creatures that seem hell bent on destroying the good 'ole US of A.Our three hapless heroes (Duchovny,  Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott) are the first to make the discovery, which is quickly and rudely taken away from them by some nasty, nasty army intelligence types (Ted Levine).But of course it soon transpires that our underdogs are really the ones with all the clues and the inside line on ridding the earth of these nasty speedily-evolved critters.Evolution unfortunately is not the sum of its parts; a film made up of a series of set pieces that do not really tie together well or even work well on their own.Many of the gags and situations fall flat primarly because of Duchovny's bizarre sense of comic timing - they ar e only saved because Orlando plays such an over the top character that it hides much of Duchovny's faults.Once our three heroes are allowed to shake the movies tendency to play it straight for the first 30 minutes it truly starts to shine.  They initially seem confined by the need to get across the necessary exposition before they are allowed to truly stretch their wings and enjoy themselves; and allow the audience to finally get some good laughs.Julianne Moore as the scientist with a heart of gold is probably one of the most miscast parts this year - she is truly at sea in this film and her characters tendency for clumsiness only makes this reviewer more bewildered about her inclusion other than somebody for Duchovny to eye off.The CGI on the whole ranges from average to good - you get one scene of dazzling work only to be confronted the next scene with some truly ordinary effects.On the whole Evolution isn't that bad - it just could have been a whole lot better.7.5 out of 10.

Think for a second - without it, we'd all be a floppy race of fish people, eating plankton and not tuna, in case it used to be a relative.  Charles Darwin truly is the daddy. However, the rest of creation hasn't caught on to the advantages of the idea yet. Personally, I think slugs are just lazy and should try harder to grow arms and legs like normal species.Such an accusation can be aimed at 'Evolution' the movie. A sci-fi comedy in the same vein as the far superior Men In Black, Reitman has simply remade Ghostbusters and replaced the ghosts with aliens. 'No bad thing', you might say. After all, Ghostbusters was a classic of its time and a thoroughly entertaining film. Yet, the second time round, it just seems as though he couldn't be bothered to advance the plot any further and the formula simply doesn't work as well.It's a promising if unoriginal premise. A meteorite lands on outskirts of small town, local scientists with shady past discover it before a government cover up, culminating in much chaos and eventual showdown (pick your 50s B-movie). Yet the plot is laboured and poorly developed, and it takes an age to get moving. Unlike its more illustrious predecessor, 'Evolution' has no 'big scene' until two-thirds of the way into the film, and often has to rely on the charisma of its lead actors to keep it moving. This wouldn't be a problem if Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd et al were on hand - but they're not (Akroyd actually has a cameo late on in the film, just to remind you of what it's missing). Orlando Jones and David Duchovny (not the most charismatic of actors at the best of times) try hard with an inoffensive and occasionally witty script, but are defeated by its sheer predictability. As for Julianne Moore's attempts at slapstick - spare me. Even the effects, one of the main selling points of the film, are nothing special. True, some of the creatures look great, but perhaps someone should tell the FX man from Jurassic Park (on set here yet again) that too many dinosaurs can eventually get a little boring? Despite this, 'Evolution' does have its moments. The Alien gestation spoof is genuinely funny, as is the alien dinosaur chase through the Mall. Orlando Jones is good throughout (though no Chris Rock), and Duchovny shows enough to suggest that he may make it on the big screen after all. Yet, with MIB available for half the price and twice the laughs (and Ghostbusters for even less), it's hard to get too excited about such an average film.

There are not as many fx in the movie as I thought th ere would be, but it's all impressive.  This is about the characters more than the fx, just as Ghostbusters was.  Interesting to note that this was originally conceived as an all out gore fest, but Ivan Reitman took it on and gave it the new angle.  The presence of Dan Aykroyd further improves things, giving a stamp of approval from the father of Ghostbusters, and the fact that he has stated his long awaited third instalment will never happen (due to Bill Murray's lack of interest) makes this film all the more important.  Gremlins was an important film form my youth and that was reworked as the excellent Small Soldiers (one of my favourite films ever) and so Evolution represents the reworking of GB's themes, but alas this is not as good a successor as Small Soldiers.  This will be a film which will come and go, I cannot see that it will change anyone's life.  Watch it as a parody on science fiction conventions, showing the way things have changed between the 50's and the 90's.

The result in this case is something that is better than the average summer comedy (I have an ability to laugh at stupid jokes, but most summer comedies push that beyond the limit), but will probably have disappointed if you were expecting either something as good as the original Ghostbusters or something with a decent plot.Which is the other thing - I read in other comments that this was originally intended as a sci-fi thriller (written by the same chap who did Arachnaphobia and John Carpenter's Vampires). Although some of the seriousness remains, I suspect the reason they changed it to a comedy may be partially because some bits are too sterotypical (things you learn from films - no US general ever listens to any advice whatsoever) and the way they tie the film up at the end is too contorted compared to some of the better ideas that they had before to fit in a thriller. I can just see the suits now saying 'Well, it's a good idea, but the plot's a little thin, the characters are two-dimensional, and we really don't like the ending as it is.

I understand Ivan Reitman's style (I loved Ghostbusters) but watching Evolution you'll realize that he's either lost his skill/edge or his mind. This movie contains no sort of originality.  Yes, it completely copies Ghostbusters 1.Main characters are professors; one sly, witty, skeptical wise-cracker hopelessly after the female lead.  The other is laughable scientist, butt of the jokes.  Sound familiar? (This doesn't work in Evolution b/c there is no char. development & the main actors' personalities are constantly being switched & traded b/t one another, contradicting earlier actions.) 2. The citywide invasion/people's reaction sequence.  Just not funny or original anymore.  (Did anyone really find the women's reaction to the alien dog believable or funny?). 3. Battle in the mall.  (Think &#145;Slimer in the hotel' sequence).4. The goofy intrusion of the military/gov't stripping the main char's of their duties.  (Remember the EPA trying to shut down the Ghostbusters?) 5. The climatic ending w/ the ragtag bunch using their wits to battle a physically enormous creature (i.e. Staypuft or the overtaking slime in Ghostbusters II which Evolution's amoebae monster was the same consistency & color as.) 6. Finally the lame commercial ending reminiscent of the Ghostbusters' tv ad.Evolution is also riddled w/ plot holes, scientific inaccuracies, & continuity errors... -As other's noted; the ridiculously small crater left by the massive meteor. -Why the dangerous flying lizard alien killed/ate no one at the mall, just scooped up a shoplifter for a joy ride(?!). -The flawed plan to lure said mall alien to the podium through the sound of Seann Scott's singing in the mic.  If its amplified through the mall's speakers, how did the alien suddenly turn around & locate the source? -If the aliens were multiplying & evolving at such a rapid rate (in the cave system) why weren't their thousands of primates escaping through the tunnel system & wrecking havoc on the city?  (There were only like 4 amongst the main colony days after they appeared) -Like these science professors would jump at the shampoo idea & order millions of bottles w/out even testing its effects. -Why didn't the shampoo spray out of the hose after we see &#145;Scott open the valve? And why doesn't the attached fire hose brought into the caves trail behind the fire truck after they dropped it & drove off? So many other ill-thought out aspects of this cinematic mess make me realize this was the work of several hack writers & amateur editing.I was also less than impressed with the tired looking computer-generated f/x that ripped from another movie, Starship Troopers.  Did anyone else notice the non-computerized close-ups of the amoebae monster (enema scene) resembled nothing like the slimy digitized version?  And can Hollywood imagine aliens that don't look like glorified insects, lizards or blobs with tentacles?! This is an insult to intelligent sci-fi fans everywhere!

Bush of comedy movies  proving once more how lowered expectations can actually work in your favor.I only went to see this film because my fiance really wanted to go.  I was worried that Orlando Jones was just going to reheat and dish out his 7-Up ads character, that David Duchovny was going to laff it up with inside jokes about X-Files (I know these government guys), and that it just wasn't going to be funny.  I was surprised on both counts  Jones turned out really quite a good performance, hitting high points with comic lines and still pulling off the relatively serious mien of his college professor role believably.  Duchovny, on the other hand, phoned it in.  He seems to have forgotten the difference between acting deadpan, and acting at all. I swear the only time his face moved was when they were singing along to Play That Funky Music in Jones' character's jeep -- and then, it was only his lips.I'm not a really picky movie viewer.  My one criteria for good movie is that I don't mentally heckle it until after the credits start rolling.  If it entertains me for the entire time it's on, it was a good film. Evolution made it for about half an hour.  By the end, I was amusing myself by looking for continuity errors and other gaffes -- and I'm not even the type of person who usually catches that sort of thing.  I mean, a character can be wearing a different colored shirt from one minute to the next and I won't notice until someone else points it out.  So if I notice that in one scene Duchovny's dripping with shampoo from head to toe and in the next when he's locking lips with Moore he's got a few token drips over the hair but hardly any on his face, it's either a big error or I'm *really* bored.The last thing that detracted from the story was the toilet humor.  Big alien farts and sphincters just aren't that funny to me.  One or two can keep the movie lively.  The grand denouement though, --.  There are probably dozens of 13 year-olds who thought it was the funniest thing ever, but as for me, I thought it was tacky and tasteless.  (I also hated Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber, if that gives you an idea of what I think is tasteless.)In terms of content, Evolution had an okay premise.  'Ghostbusters' meets 'Men in Black' it was not, but it could've stood on its own with a little more work.  Alien meteorite falls to earth, bringing with it its own creepy-crawlies.  The effects were quite good, I thought -- the little blue dog alien was so cute that I could hardly blame the Avon lady for trying to pet him (although you know that it was going to lead to no good), the dead flying aliens were realistic, and the insect-like ones were downright neat.  The score was well-done and fitting.I went in expecting to exit the theatre wishing I could retrieve the previous two hours of my life.  I actually came out with a more favorable opinion than I would have thought.  Whether that's a good thing or not is anyone's guess. ) "},{"Title":"The FIlm Independence Day Wanted To Be...","Date":"20 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This is the film that Independence Day wanted to be before it went and got all self conscious and frankly ridiculous. Highbrow, Evolution is not. Entertaining, it most certainly is. The plot (as ever), is an alien threat to human existence - this time posed by the crash-landing of a meteor. Oozing blue goo, there's something defiantly dodgy about this meteor, as Ira Caine (David Duchovny) and colleague Harry Block (Orlando Jones) soon discover.In true alien-flick tradition, the military heavy-handedly take over the potentially 'delicate' operation, swiftly sidelining 'good-guys' Caine and Block. Who'd have thought it eh? The gung-ho general in charge, doesn't understand the nature and gravity of the situation and the need for appropriate action! Ira and Harry therefore form a rebel alliance to save the nation from the life-threatening consequences of the blue goo and it's dramatic evolution.The cast list on paper is bewildering, the likes of professional 'goofball' Seann William Scott (Road Trip, American Pie) as the favourable accidental hero, alongside sometime acting-heavyweight Julianne Moore (Hannibal, The End of the Affair)as the klutzy, awkward yet likable love-interest and Fox Mulder! The trademark dry wit is there from Duchovny, along with some not-so-trademark and not-so-sensible blonde/reddish highlights. And yes, there are some genuinely funny references to his FBI alter ego as the crew discover that Ira Caine is indeed more than just teacher.You must suspend all disbelief and be prepared to enjoy the film in all its formulaic glory; toilet humour, shameless yet hilarious product placement and the inevitable underdogs save-the-planet-while-twisted-old-authority-figure-gets-his-just-rewards type narrative.An American laugh-out-loud film seldom comes along these days, oh wait, there was Pearl Harbor? But Evolution will have you laughing out loud from as early on as the opening scene, which sees Scott's aspiring fireman, practicing his rescue techniques with a plastic dummy in the middle of the desert (watch it!).In a nutshell, when there's something strange in the neighbourhood, who you gonna call? David Duchovny! Yep, the makers of Ghostbusters have well and truly exorcised the demons of Ghostbusters 2 with this latest outing.

Apparently, I was wrong. 'Evolution' has a basic, simple story like I expected, but it is packed with originality, impressive special effects and hearty laughs. The movie is about this meteor that falls on earth. This meteor suddenly begins to excrete a special liquid that over time, turns into monstrous creatures from outer space which are, well, you know, the bad aliens. Two college teachers, Duchovny and Jones, and one aspiring fireman, Scott, team up to stop them from spreading across the globe, but as you would expect, the government wants to do things their way, so they ignore their valid advice. The movie goes on from there.Throughout the movie, Duchovny acts with really no effort (well, does he ever not?), Jones plays the role of serious/funny guy perfectly, and Scott does also a good job as the goofy young slacker who follows the guys everywhere.There's this one scene, when this flying alien is in the mall with the three guys trying to capture it, which totally kicked ass. Expect it when you watch the movie.All in all, 'Evolution' is a great movie. Of course it won't win any Oscars or anything (which it should, but those people are stupid...) but it is a movie which entertains you for the whole time, and you'll never wonder what time it is and when you're going home while you're watching it.9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Great Film!

Oh, I know it is not deep, serious entertainment like a play by Shakespeare, but so what?  The premise that some sort of alien life form could infest our planet from a meteor strike is not all that far fetched.  Microbes and such that live in space might spread all over the universe that way.  Of course, I doubt (and hope) that if something did come our way, its ecosystem would not produce such different forms of life quite so quickly.I thought everyone in this movie played it as unstated over the top as possible without being too silly. It reminded me of one of my favorite movies, Ghostbusters. Maybe because they were both directed by a talented gentleman named Ivan?All of the actors and actresses were terrific.  The chemistry between them was great. It seemed like they were all having a good time making this evolve into something the whole family could enjoy together.The only really serious and not make believe part of the movie, was the mention of the hard times some of our soldiers are experiencing after they had taken the Anthrax vaccine. I think some have even been court- martialed for refusing to take it. That David Duchovny's character, Ira Kane, had invented the vaccine, was thought provoking.      A snippet of wee negativity from this movie goer.  In the scene where the police were taking pictures with the meteor, didn't anyone ever warn them of a hazard called radiation?  Even our heroes didn't check for that possible gift from space.  Picky, picky, I know.John Powell's music is wonderful.  The scenery is lovely.  Michael Chapman did a great job with the cinematography.  All of the alien gritters are very colorful, albeit hungry little devils.Out of a possible ten, I give Evolution an eight on the Alien Scale of fun science fiction movies. It made me laugh and think at the same time.

I have not been this let down at a movie in a long time; possibly ever. I really wanted to like this movie.  The summer is the season for big, effects-driven alien flicks, and I was hoping that this would be at least as enjoyable as MIB or Independence Day.  Especially since the cast included David Duchovny and Julianne Moore.  I was expecting snappy dialogue.  Alas, there wasn't even tolerable dialogue. There were three writers who are responsible for this hideous screenplay.  I would think that between THREE writers a half decent script could be produced. The movie started out poorly and just kept getting worse.  At first I thought that Julianne Moore would enter into the picture and make things better.  She actually may have made it worse.  I barely remember that she was even in the film.  The romance, or whatever, that formed between her character and Duchovny's was unexplained, bizarre, and mostly irritating. About 2/3 through the movie a terrifying thought occurred to me Dan Akroyd is also in this movie!  This is going to get WORSE!  Indeed he showed up and played Dan Akroyd rather convincingly. It struck me that perhaps Reitman wanted to make a movie with Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith, but could not afford them.  Although I would not in any way blame the acting for the painful experience that this film turned out to be.  The actors really had nothing to work with at all.The film lacked a single interesting moment.  The aliens were not unique-looking.  I half-expected the dragon thing that was in the department store to start talking like Sean Connery.  There were an amazing amount of other movies being ripped off in this film.  I stopped counting at about 15.   Duchovny said that he chose to do this movie because he wanted to get as far away from the X-Files as possible (??!!).  If he meant that he wanted to do something that was unoriginal and poorly-written, then mission accomplished.  But it seemed to me that aliens, an evil government/military cover-up and an icy red-head hint at a really bad X-Files spoof. I am a fan of Duchovny's and I really hope that he has a good movie career, but man I hope that he doesn't do more movies that are way beneath him like this.  Same goes for Moore.  The best part of the film was Seann William Scott, who I had anticipated would be the worst part.  Perhaps because he did not look quite so out-of-place.   At the end of the movie (I would not call this a spoiler) when the three male stars did a spoof commercial, I was hoping that it would be an apology instead.  I can say one good thing about this movie it has given me hope that I can write a Hollywood screenplay.

Okay, whatever, I'll believe it.  The federal government discovers it so they send... the U.S. Army and one CDC representative?  Wouldn't there be a reaction of just a bit more magnitude?  As fast as these organisms evolve, they still can't evolve to breathe oxygen.  They can evolve wings, fins, teeth, claws etc, but no oxygen lungs...  until they are already at dinosaur form. And then it just so happens that Duchovny and Jones happen to be there to witness the first organism that successfully evolves into an oxygen breather.As if the bad science wasn't bad enough, there is a fair degree of plain bad logic as well.  What about that method by which they discovered the magic formula for destroying the aliens?  All of this plot sloppiness ends up discrediting Duchovny's and Jones' characters as intelligent scientists.**end spoilers**So maybe I am being a bit too harsh and picky with the messy science.  However, especially in the latter half, Evolution failed as a comedy as well.  When I saw this movie, a lot of the jokes and lines fell completely flat on a packed theatre of eager and willing movie-goers.  As with many mediocre movies trying to cover their butts, most of the funny moments are shown in the trailers.  By the end of the movie, it has completely degenerated into lowgrade slapstick.Jones' character has some potential to be an original role, but ends up being the classic goofy, dirty-minded, trash-talking black sidekick instead.  Julianne Moore' character was pretty flat.  The audience laughed the first 2 or 3 times she tripped, but after that it got old.  The role of attractive, yet clutzy, female works sometimes, but Moore was a poor choice.Some of the visual effects are well done, though they're nothing special in today's movie market.  The cutesy monster was probably one of the most entertaining parts of the whole movie.In the end, Evolution is just cliche and predictable.  I don't mind cliche movies, as long as they are done well, which Evolution isn't.  If you think about it, there really are no surprises.  So my best advice is to try to not think as you watch this movie.  Just absorb it, but don't process it too much, much like those sea-sponges that suck in debris.

And overall, the film just wasn't that funny for a comedy.Another thing that was surprisinging to me, was the character design.  In spoofs like Ghostbusters and Men in Black, the characters had a cute feel to them. But, the creatures in Evolution are actually pretty scary looking.  Even the one dog creature you think is cute ends up having a hideous turkey-head thing in his mouth.

Men in Black will always be a favorite of mine, for a while when it hit video, I watched it a lot, and grabbed the DVD when it game out.

Ivan Reitman has a stellar idea (crossing X-Files with Ghostbusters) but can't quite get the performances he needs to bring it all home.Plot is fairly simple, a meteor crashes into the earth carrying a strange life form.  Once settled, it begins converting the atmosphere within the caverns in which it crashed to one habitable for the life forms it carries with it.  A couple of science professors, Ira Kane (Duchovney) and Harry Block (smartly played by Orlando Jones) are the first to investigate the crash site.  Eventually, as is always the case, the US Army becomes involved and manages to botch everything up, and eventually provide the final ingredient needed to allow the organisms to overrun the planet.  Of course, Kane needs a nemesis/love interest, and that is provided in the form of Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) of the CDC.Moore plays her character far looser than she needs to, and her attempts at slapstick humor (think Chevy Chase's Gerald Ford impressions on SNL) are laughable only because they're so bad.  David Duchovney's character is slightly better, played dry but comes across as likeable and humorous. Orlando Jones makes the movie as Harry Block.  Coaching the women's volleyball team at the community college gives him a chance for some cheap self-gratification, He is also the area USGS rep, thus allowing Kane and himself access to the meteor initally.  Jones steals the movie, and the full version of the bug in the leg scene used in the trailers (most of the funniest stuff is in the trailers BTW) is fall out of your chair funny.Seann William Scott also shines as the dim witted Wayne Green.  While practicing rescue missions for the firefighter test, Wayne witnesses the meteor hit and is front and center once Kane and Block prepare to battle the alien threat.  That's the best I can do for the cast...Dan Ackroyd puts forth a token effort as the Governor of Arizona, Ted Levine plays the irritatingly irrational Dr. Woodman of USAMRID.  Rest of the cast is forgettable and mainly just background clutter.The ending is just as silly, and while I won't ruin it here, the film concludes with (of all things) a commercial for the product.Evolution had a very original idea and quite possibly could have been a sleeper hit for this summer had the material been nutured correctly.

Although the story uses some cliches, it uses them well, and so it's not really a problem. The three main characters (Duchovny, Jones, and Scott) are fairly typical underdog hero types. However they are all very funny, and some of the comedy is far better that a lot of recent comedies. Going in, you're going to have a pretty good idea how it ends, of course, it's getting to that ending that makes this movie good. For instance, you know that our heroes will come up with some ingenious method to stop the aliens, but in Evolution, they come up with an idea (which I won't spoil) that is also very funny. The script for Evolution is far better than many recent comedies. There are quite a few witty conversations between the characters that go beyond the typical slapstick, shock-oriented humor that has become popular of late. That said, the film does occasionally lapse into some gross-out humor (like an extended fart gag near the end), but fortunately there's not too much of it, and there's enough of the more intelligent comedy to make up for it.The acting in Evolution was also quite good. David Duchovny proves that he can do comedy, and in a way, almost mocks his X-Files character in this movie. He deadpans many of his lines, but his timing is good, and so this works for great comedic effect, instead of being boring. I was especially impressed with Orlando Jones, who was not only very funny, but proved that he could be serious at times. Jones actually had some of the lines that made me laugh the most. He's one of the few comedians who's acting skills constantly impress me. Seann William Scott is pretty good as well, though he does play basically play the same character he's played in many of his films. He seems like he could be a pretty good actor, I'd love to see him try something different. Julianne Moore is, of course, a very talented actress, and brings as much to her role as she can. Her character is, however, the least developed of the four, and so she doesn't really shine here, but she at least manages to keep her character from seeming too one dimensional.Overall, I enjoyed Evolution. It's not perfect; there's a few plot holes and a few of the jokes misfire. Most of them, however, do not, and the movie manages to become an entertaining, well-acted, summer comedy. And even if you DON'T like the movie, you'll still love the special effects. So go see it...there's plenty of worse things you could do to kill a couple hours.Rating 8/10 "},{"Title":"Theory of EVOLUTION With Apologies to Darwin","Date":"9 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Quick...what's funnier than a fat dumb guy with a bad hair cut???  That's right!  TWO dumb fat guys with bad haircuts!  Director Ivan Reitman constantly sinks lower than primordial slime in order to coax a few meager chuckles out of this sad GHOSTBUSTERS wannabe movie.  Along with the tubby twosome, Reitman adds a bug-eyed black guy (paging Ernie Hudson), a buxom blonde beauty queen, a geeky military guy with coke bottle glasses, anal sex humor, fart jokes, a leading lady with the grace of Gerald Ford, a hardass Army general obsessed with blowing things up, some of the dullest aliens ever to be computer generated, idiotic dialogue, and X-Files David Duchovny mooning.  And just in you don't get the GHOSTBUSTERS connection, Reitman dumps amiable Dan Aykroyd into the mess.  What Reitman failed to realize is that the formula that made GHOSTBUSTERS and its ilk such a success was that except for the ghosts (here aliens), everything else in the film was perfectly believable - characters and all.  In EVOLUTION, reality flies out the window in the opening scenes (Duchovny's college prof gives to losers who don't know a biological cell from a prison cell a C instead of flunking their fat asses) and never returns.  When Duchovny's back story is revealed, it is so stupid that you'll wanna go out for popcorn and never come back.  At least he has a back story.  Co-star Orlando Jones doesn't even merit one.  Oh, and of course Duchovny and leading lady Julianne Moore have instant attraction syndrome.  I won't tell how the pic ends (duh!) but suffice it to say that Head & Shoulders Shampoo has taken the place of the Staypuft Marshmellow Man. Is it still too late for a bio-pic of Charles Darwin?  Throw in some fat kids, farting, buxom babes, aliens exploding and leads with good tv and teen Q and it might just be the hit of the summer!

In a descending order, they are- Proctologist- Flatulence- AssConstipation may also fit somewhere in there.Evolution is a movie that prompts us to question the mentality of the movie-making process.  I figure that there could have been two possible scenarios when the producers were preparing for this movie.  The first one must have involved the idea of rapidly-evolving extraterrestrial lifeforms invading earth;  after the idea was realized, perhaps somebody decided to include a bunch of ass jokes.  Or, scenario number 2I want to make a movie with a lot of ass jokes.  What scenario could we develop to fit these jokes into?How about aliens invading earth?  The king alien could have a really huge ass and blow everything to smithereens with sheer willpower.  We could then have a couple scientists attempt to clog up the problem.I like it!Fortunately, somewhere along the line somebody decided to make it tasteful, or either PG-13 friendly, so what we get here is nowhere near as crass as most of today's R-rated comedies.  But it still leaves a little something to be desired when jokes revolve in and out around the same idea.Sometimes, the performances of the main characters are enough to salvage a film;  in the case of Evolution, the main roles give the movie a type of innocent air that luckily makes it both enjoyable and exciting.  David Duchovny plays Ira Kane, a former government scientist who after an unfortunate turn of events became a community college biology professor.  Along with Harry Block (Orlando Jones), one of the other resident scientists of the college, they set out to investigate a peculiar meteor crash out in the Arizona desert.After taking a few samples, they realize that the cells retrieved from the meteor are multiplying at an alarming rate, completing an evolutionary process that would normally take aeons in just a few hours.  They then go back to the meteor crash to pursue their findings, only to find the military involved and casting them out of the project.  So, along with an aspiring firefighter (Wayne Green) and the military's head scientist (Julianne Moore), they head out to expunge the aliens from their planet, no questions asked.The chemistry between Duchovny and Jones is what makes the movie shine, keeping it continuously fresh despite its inherent banality.  There are a few missed opportunities that in the end truly detracted from the overall grade, however.  The first is that during potentially funny situations, absolutely nothing was done to lighten the mood of the narrative;  the first thirty minutes of the film can very well lead you to believe that you're going to be watching a drama if you don't know what the movie is about in the first place.  The second missed opportunity comes in the form of the aliens.  Though featured in more than a couple of scenes, they never managed to constitute a sensation of dread.  Jump-out-of-your-seat scenes, yes;  but there never really was an established danger to humanity to justify wiping them out in the manner that the movie's characters do, unless you consider flying reptiles taking young girls for a stroll in the mall a grave danger.In the end, Evolution misses the target by a couple of meters.  Nevermind that the characters involved are all caricatures;  it's what this type of movie mandates, and manages to work in really well.  Forget about the cheesy special effects or the lame reactions to the CG extraterrestrials.  The problem here is that in order to work in a few good bellylaughs, the story sets up for them in a ho-hum fashion that incorporates any type of bathroom humor conceivable.  It's enjoyable, but considering how much the stars improved this picture to begin with, a good screenplay could have worked marvels.6/10 "},{"Title":"Just what you need if you're in a silly mood.","Date":"9 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I already knew walking in that this was not going to be a brilliant piece of work.

As a comedy, this is right alongside Men in Black and the movie this was most associated with, Ghostbusters. This really isn't that much like Ghostbusters, in tone, premise, or look, but I guess I can see where people would think they're alike, what with the buddies chasing creatures in a Reitman movie. Anyway, there are typical hit-and-miss jokes here, some good, some bad, though the good seems to outweigh the bad here. The scene with the alien birdy is probably the highlight of the movie comedically, with both outright humor (Scott, who was surprisingly good here, trying to lure the creature with George of the Jungle bird calls) and some more subtly funny things (the guns used by the heroes still have price tags dangling on them). As for the performances, this is pretty much Orlando's show, but the rest of the actors do what they can. Akyroyd is great, as usual. Moore seems to have had a lot of her scenes cut, but she's still a good heroine. Duchovny is basically a laid-back Mulder, which is just fine here. Scott plays the exact same character he always does, only with funny galoshes and rubber pants.Altogether, worth the money and the trip. A fun movie you can see with a couple pals.

Coming off the filming of HANNIBAL, this must have been a needed respite for Moore.  True, she doesn't really do much in the film but, folks, a movie about hyper-evolving aliens is not the kind of flick where you look for character development.While the flick does stint on the human side, the critters are incredible.

Of course, the deflated corpse was CGI while the later corpse was a prop, so we can chalk this up to the two departments not quite talking to each other.Oh, and if anyone every gets around to filming McCaffrey's PERN series, I hope they keep these FX guys in mind, as they do a highly believable dragon!

The works was based on his studies of nature in the Galapagos Islands and formed the basis for the modern study of evolution and species. In 2001 Director Ivan Reitman, who brought such Blockbusters as Ghostbusters and Twins to the silver screen gives us a look at evolution on a cosmic basis and how the rules on Earth may not apply elsewhere in the universe in his new film Evolution   The films star David Duchovny of the X-Files as Ira Kane a once prominent government scientist who has fallen from grace and ends up teaching at a small community college in Arizona.  Ira is making the best of his situation and spends his days dispensing knowledge while grading with a very liberal grading curve to the delight of his students. Ira's day takes a slight detour when his fellow teacher, and college Womans Volleyball coach,  Harry Block (Orlando Jones of Mad TV) tells him that he has been assigned to check out a meteor that has crashed nearby, and that he would like Ira to come along.   Before long, Ira and Harry discover that the meteor is something out of the ordinary, as it contains alien microbes that evolve at a rapid pace.  With visions of fame and fortune in their heads, the two conduct their studies in secret, less they have to share their Noble Prize. Before viewers know it, The Military gets wind of the site and steps in to take control of the situation.  Matters are complicated for Ira and Harry when the General in charge of the site, General Woodman,(Ted Levine) is a former colleague of Ira's who remembers all to well Ira fell from grace. Heading the research team is Allison Reed (Julianne Moore)a klutzy yet brilliant scientist who sees the meteor as the find of a lifetime.  It does not take long for the Government to be in way over their heads, as the microbes evolve at a rapid pace and soon, nasty lifeforms are starting to sprout up all over town, at a pace that will have the new lifeforms in control of the entire country in just two months. Not content to let the Aliens take the planet, General Woodman, and the Governor (Dan Aykroyd) decide to blow them all sky high, despite Ira's warning that the heat in the explosions will only make the life forms grow even faster.   With the destruction of humanity evident, it is up to Ira, Harry, Allison, and a vapid fireman hopeful, Wayne Green (Sean William Scott to save the day. The film does have its funny moments, but there are some big lags between the jokes, and the characters never seem to gel. Duchovny and Jones work well with one another, but Moore seems to be there to only be the love interest as her character provides little to the film.  Scott also suffers the same fate as Wayne is little more than comic relief and onboard to play the loser, who is the wrong guy in the wrong place, at the wrong time. I would have liked to have seen a bit more story to the film as despite the rapid evolution of the creatures, we did not see much menace from them, unless you count mall shoppers being buzzed by a flying lifeform, menace terror.  It seems that Reitman was trying to do a homage to the old Alien invasion flicks of the 50's but those films always had images of the mass destruction and terror caused by the creatures and this film had little of that. I discovered that the film was planned to be a serious film but had the tone lightened significantly when Reitman came on board.  what could have been a comedy/sci-fi  classic, quickly becomes an exercise in waiting for the jokes in between special effects that are not so special.  If Evolution is any indication of the films being offered to David Duchovny, then perhaps he might want to rethink his decision to leave the X-Files less he becomes the next David Caruso. One can only hope that Darwin was right about only the strong surviving, and that Evolution will wither on the vine, as the film is disaster, that is badly in need of evolving a better story, dialogue, and more substantial parts for the very talented cast2.5 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach gareth@nwlink.com  "},{"Title":"Better than I thought","Date":"4 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  OK, this is not Galaxy Quest and (Duchovny aside) it is not an X-Files spoof either, but still it is fun to watch - especially in the beginning.Nice effects, numerous interesting aliens (not the kind you see in every other movie), characters and dialogue are funny, too.

There's a scene where a guy moons another character, Orlando Jones has to undergo proctology to remove an alien infection, and then there's the climax which turned my stomach instead of making my laugh.Apart from the proctology-centered jokes, there was more in Evolution that just gave me the creeps as opposed to making me laugh. Instead of making me laugh, the alien organisms and their variety of shapes and sizes made me want to gag. And this ties in with how much better the movie would have been if it had approached the subject matter from a more cemented angle. It's at these moments that you realize the movie has an identity crisis and that also gets in the way of any pleasure you might have otherwise absorbed.Bottom line, there are a few moments to the movie that I did enjoy, but they did not outnumber the parts that made me cringe, roll my eyes, shake my head, and wish I had chosen another movie. Perhaps a proctologist would find this movie amusing. Personally, I thought it was kind of repulsive, disorientated, and very, very dry. This is a first-class example of a missed opportunity.

As soon as the fart and butt jokes started coming, I knew that was it. (Why is the expulsion of intestinal gas regarded with such mirth?) As it was, the movie just got stupider by the minute in the second half, very few of the gags were funny, the science went down the drain and the shampoo commercial ruined whatever was left.Although it is possible to mix SF with comedy, it is very hard to make it actually work. This is a miserable attempt to roll Ghostbusters, MIB and X-Files into one. It didn't just not work, the end product is just embarrassing.If it was going to be merely a vehicle for potty humour, then why didn't they do the obvious and just hire Jim Carrey to do the lead? I can't work out why Duchovny and Moore would agree to be dragged into this career-smearing, steaming turd. The money must've been good.Finally, I would like to comment on all the rave reviews I see here. This is a sad indictment of what this Western society of ours appears to regard as good entertainment. Anybody over 9 years old who finds this funny should immediately do some serious self-examination.I give it a 2, only because the SFX were not too bad, other than the cutesy, Spielberg_esque facial expressions on some of the Aliens.

An unlikely duo of college professors who happen to discover that the military is covering this up because it happens to contain alien life forms? Or what about kicking these aliens' butt when they start getting nasty? Whatever your summer-viewing pleasure hankers, EVOLUTION delivers, even if sometimes you wonder if you have seen this all before. I first watched this in the theaters, then watched it numerous times on TV, and I never got tired of watching it. Lots of laughs, suspense and over-the-top fun, what more can you ask for. The film closely goes with the same line of the genre as in great hit monster flicks like MIB Men in Black and the hit Ghostbusters films. This film is directed by Ivan Reitman, who also directed both Ghostbusters and the sequel. Reitman once again gifts the film with hilarious touches of humor, and some weird bits of suspense, resulting into a hilarious summer action delight. David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Julianne Moore, Sean William Scott and the rest of the cast don't just bring laughs, they also have the charm which will make you adore their characters. Sometimes, the movie works because the chemistry melds together, and these guys have it. As far as summertime entertainment is concerned, it ain't really about trying to come up with something original, it's really more of how you wave the magic wand to make it work. Reitman may have used his GHOSTBUSTERS formula to the death here (while throwing in a little MIB and an X-FILES send-off, or maybe a dash of reptilian monsters borrowed from JURASSIC PARK), but he has the right magic to make this one work at least one more time.

In this film, David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore portray the oddball foursome who uses its wit and `expertise' to help eradicate an otherworldly menace.  Instead of ghosts, in `Evolution' we have a host of single-celled aliens who crash land in the Arizona desert aboard a flaming meteorite. The problem is that these organisms seem to have the ability to evolve to higher life forms in a radically sped-up time frame and, in no time at all, the Southwest desert - and soon the whole world - stand in deadly peril of being overrun by this invading force from another planet.`Evolution' is a mediocre attempt to parody those cheesy sci-fi monster flicks of the 1950's, right down to the discovery of the one chemical that turns out to be the creatures' Achilles Heal.  Of course, the special effects are far more impressive in this film than they ever were in any of those earlier works - which goes to prove that, when it came right down to it, even the makers of this multi-million dollar summer blockbuster didn't have the nerve to go all the way with the parody, possibly risking a loss on their investment (the film was a disappointment at the box office and lost money anyway).  In fact, if anything, the special effects end up burying the humor of the film -which isn't all that rich to begin with.  The jokes are often crude and juvenile and much of the film's running time is spent trying to up the `ick' factor through the disgusting nature of the creatures that develop.  The film often succeeds in that respect.  Of the performers, Jones and Scott are given the most material to work with in creating comic characters.  Duchovny and Moore are basically relegated to thankless straight-man status.  `Ghostbusters' veteran, Dan Akroyd, provides some genuine laughs as the bombastic and pompous governor of the state.There really isn't much to say about `Evolution' - except to say that there isn't much to say.  It's watchable but hardly memorable and fails to fulfill its potential of becoming a hip sci-fi comedy on the order of, say, `Men in Black.'  Reitman does better when his threats come from right down here on earth.

The latter also had Don Jakoby as its primary writer, and he's complained that later rewrites of both the spider movie and this new one punched up the comic quotient - but Arachnophobia knew to take its scare scenes seriously, and this doesn't. But that's to be expected, since Arachnophobia was executive produced by Steven Spielberg, whereas Evolution was directed by Ivan Reitman.Reitman and DreamWorks (and Columbia, who released it outside North America) clearly hoped for another Ghostbusters, even to the extent of having Dan Aykroyd along for the ride (we already have Bill Murray in the form of David Duchovny, with Orlando Jones doing Ernie Hudson, Seann William Scott as Rick Moranis, Ted Levine as William Atherton etc), and the result is certainly a vast improvement over Ghostbusters II, Extreme Ghostbusters and especially Filmation's Ghostbusters, but not up to the original film or The Real Ghostbusters. In fact, the early going veers closer in quality to another supernatural outing with Dan Aykroyd, namely Psi Factor - it's not scary and not too funny either, with Julianne Moore wasted as a clumsy scientist (bringing up unpleasant memories of Emma Thompson in Junior) and the kind of obsession with backsides usually associated with horny fans of Jennifer Lopez.The serious moments are overall more effective than the comedic ones, which helps demonstrate what a wasted opportunity this is, and some of the FX by the Tippett Studio, Sony Pictures Imageworks, PDI/DreamWorks and KNB EFX Group are uneven - but while it has too much effects work and too little script work (and those who were furious at Cast Away for its FedEx plugs have a fresh target here -  I won't give it away, but let's just say a cameo from Denise Richards would not have gone amiss), Evolution manages to get its act together in the second half, meaning that if it misses the target, at least it also misses the endangered species list.

Of course, *minor spoiler* our heroes fighting the bird alien in the mall is definitely the scene that makes the similarities seems more than a little coincidental. *end spoiler*.So basically, you have a film about a group of wacky university scientists running around and saving the world when no one seems to be able to.  And while this movie lacks some of the sly wit of Ghostbusters, there were more than a few occasions that I laughed out loud at either a ridiculous situation, or a well-placed comment.  The special effects were really nice looking, and didn't seem out of place (i.e. a noticeable addition onto the frame).  But for the life of me, I can't remember any of the musical score.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it didn't make an impact, whatever it was.Okay, so the fate of the world rested in the hands of a well-placed product placement.  And yes, I thought the movie was pretty silly at times, sometimes too much for its own good.  But I think what pulled it all together for me, was the fact that it had an enjoyable cast (Duchovny and Jones were enjoyable, as was Scott, who was so goofy, it surprisingly actually worked for me), it's more than obvious similarities to Ghostbusters (one of my favorite film series from the '80's), and you know, this film was a blast to just turn off reality and sit back to have fun with.  I think that counts for something in itself.For all the Hollywood red tape, Ghostbusters 3 may never see the light of day.  So I guess Evolution takes on a while different meaning, as this is the best (foreseeably for now) that fans are going to get to a sequel.I can live with that.

This is the first movie he's directed in four years after the failure of the Billy Crystal movie FATHERS' DAY, but he still know how to put together a comedy classic that is sure to entertain the next generation. Even though some people might see EVOLUTION as just another GHOSTBUSTERS rip-off, the truth is that EVOLUTION is a bigger and funnier movie than GHOSTBUSTERS was. It finds new ways of surprising us and new ways of making us laugh without using old hollywood cliches. The movie runs a little long, but that is only because it takes a little while for the plot to set up. After the plot is set up, the entertainment begins and so do the laughs. This one will keep you laughing for a very long time. It made me laugh for hours after I got out of the theatre.

Most of the actors portray pretty much the exact same type of character that they usually do, so I don't know how much it really took for the actors to get into character or act their parts. The humor is childish, cheesy and juvenile throughout. The special effects look hideous. The science fiction elements are poor.

So, in conclusion, if you are a fan of the newer, apparently popular, one-note childish, juvenile crude humor as seen on shows like Family Guy and (sadly) recent episodes of The Simpsons, look no further... or, maybe, look further, as even that type of humor is better in other films... but, anyway, if you aren't, stay away.

In theory, they were correct, but his attempt to do so is largely a failure.The premise is a clever one. An alien substance has landed on earth and begins to evolve at an incredible rate, going from goo to flatworms to dinosaurs to apes in a matter of days. The best part of the movie is the creature design, which is really impressive.The movie focuses on a couple of college science teachers who investigate this substance.The first thing to note is that these teachers handle this very badly, even though the movie doesn't seem to think so. They don't seem to recognize the danger of a rapidly evolving substance out in the wild for quite a while, irresponsibly telling no one, so when others interfere, I failed to feel the sort of outrage one normally is expected to feel when the heroes lose control of something. In this case, that's exactly what should have happened.The illogic of the script goes beyond the stupidity of the teachers. A central plot point relies on the army to have not done one of the first scientific tests that any idiot would do with an alien substance. Meanwhile, another scientist, played by Julianne Moore, is established early on as clumsy. The problem is, this in no way defines or establishes the character nor is it particularly funny, so it feels like a pointless addition, as though the writers realized that she wasn't very interesting and decided to give her a random quirk.The movie also concerns a wannabe firefighter, and his presence is as extraneous as Moore's clumsiness. He appears to be in the movie only because there were three ghostbusters so Reitman wanted three alien- busters. But you could excise him from the film without losing much of anything.While sometimes amusing and filled with cool visual effects, this movie is constructed so poorly that it never achieves any momentum. Ultimately it is what happened when Ghostbusters devolved.

It follows the same sort of archetypal set-up in its assembly of a team, and an otherworldly problem only they can handle, despite meddling and objections from government forces.For all intents and purposes, one could safely call it a sort of spiritual remake of Ghostbusters with a focus on Sci-Fi rather than the supernatural.And for the most part, Evolution works as a fun little film.David Duchovny and Orlando Jones star as Arizona college professors Ira Kane and Harry Block. When a meteorite crashes, they go to investigate, taking samples which show something curious- the microbial alien life attached to the meteor appear to be evolving at a highly accelerated rate- millions of years of evolution in mere hours. As the evolution progresses more and more, turning the site of the meteor into a full- fledged, miniature alien atmosphere and forest, government agents arrive. Lead by a former college (Ted Levine) from Ira's military days, the government locks out Kane and Block, and quarantines the area. With them is beautiful government official Alison Reed (Julianne Moore).However, the accelerated evolution begins to cause problems as the alien life begins to escape and threaten the nearby city. Ira and Harry are forced to team with Alison as well as good-natured by oafish local fireman Wayne Grey (Sean William Scott) to battle the alien menace and save the day.The saving graces of the film really fall to two main aspects the chemistry of the cast and the superb direction by Reitman.The cast gives generally good performances and mesh together quite well. Duchovny is a joy as Ira Kane and bring a lot of heart, and the obvious love story with the clumsy but ultimately good Alison Reed is fun to watch play out. Jones is good as Harry Block, though he always struck me as being a bit on the cartoonish side. Sean William Scott is hilarious, but again a little too broad as Wayne Grey. But the four together make an admirable, memorable team and function extremely well together on screen. Once together, they create a great heart to the story, and keep you interested as a viewer. Other performances by the likes of Ted Levine and a cameo by Dan Aykroyd are marvelous.The direction is the other strong piece in the film. Reitman has always been a simple but wonderful visual storyteller, and his direction is first class.However, the film does have a lot of flaws. Mainly relating back to the script and comedic set-pieces. There's just a few too many jokes built around... *ahem* rear-ends, and it becomes juvenile. A lot of the jokes are also a bit too obvious and broad. And it moves just a tad too fast for it's own good, making it feel a little forgettable in the long run.But all-in-all, this is a fun little semi-forgotten film from the early 2000's. It's a great rainy-day movie, and I'd recommend it for some laughs.Evolution gets a solid 7 out of 10 from me.

Evolves QUICKLY. This is discovered by two unorthodox scientists (Orlando Jones and David Duchovny, both pretty good on screen with the latter particularly enjoyable in deadpan comedy mode) and one young lad who happens to be in the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time while training to be a fireman (Seann William Scott). Before you can say mega-amoeba it's a race to stop things getting out of hand as the suburbs of America play host to all kinds of strange, new creatures all trying to adapt to Earth's atmosphere and set the stage for the next step in the evolutionary process.It's clear to see what director Ivan Reitman thought he could do with this material as it's very much a riff on the Ghostbusters vibe. We have some likable leads with good chemistry (no pun intended), a small and unusual problem growing into something potentially world-threatening and a series of scenes blending special effects with some inoffensive comedy.Sadly, it certainly fails to reach anywhere near the heights of Reitman's ectoplasm-filled hit and this is due to a number of reasons.First of all, the laughs just aren't THAT funny. As already mentioned, Jones and Duchovny do well but Seann William Scott's schtick was already a little tired by this point and Julianne Moore's accident-prone character is, frankly, quite embarrassing to watch . . . . . comedy is certainly not her forte.Secondly, Reitman lets the effects take centre stage instead of weaving them throughout the plot line and around the chemistry of the leads.Thirdly, despite the fact that the movie is all about a giant threat to all mankind things never really feel as if there is any actual giant threat to all of mankind.Evolution isn't without it's entertaining moments (and with a cast including the likes of Ted Levine, Sarah Silverman and Dan Aykroyd in supporting roles there is probably something for everyone here) but it's quite a waste of talent compared to what we all know could have ended up on screen. Which should have really been more than just some bizarre, limp Head & Shoulders advert.See this if you like The Blob, Species, Ghostbusters 2.

There is no doubt that this was a kind of vacation for everyone took a part in it. And there is no doubt that there is something wrong with it.. even if slightly.Since its first release I watched 3 times already. And after the last one I discovered the real problem of it. It's the nature of its character; was it a comedy with smart irony ?, or was it a sci-fi horror with diligent CGI?, or was it something mediocre in between ?Surely it's not Ghostbusters for the same director 15 years ago without the strong cast, the goofy look, or the prospering antecedence. Unlike the old formula  spoof of a spook, then a good laugh, this time it's a real spooky scene, then a tired smile. Actually here there is more talking about science, less comedy, and horrible images sometimes (still the moment of that creature at the bathroom scares the hell out of me, deeming it one of the most terrifying indeed!).The many sci-fi details were catchy and creative but not funny. Moments like the rampant blue creature, the gigantic mucus and the climax right up the alien's anus make the movie's original not-so-visible comedy more invisible and full of bad taste. There are some scenes you won't find at any comedy (the huge dead creatures in the valley) which confirms some ambition this movie just doesn't achieve or enjoys missing with. So with useless scenes like the 3 leading men singing in their Jeep you've got to feel that the main script was really a pure sci-fi in the first place then got a little polishing to be fit as a comedy as well!Sorrowfully, David Duchovny and Julianne Moore didn't make me laugh, didn't enthuse me as action heroes, and didn't have any chemistry on-screen (I know, before blaming them, and the casting, I must blame the screenplay). I even felt that (Duchovny) was younger than his character not to mention frigid at places. Simply all of that left all the time in the world for (Orlando Jones) to own the charisma, create freely and be memorable. (Evolution) is a mix. Somehow dazzling as a sci-fi but not as a comedy. And you know what ? Both ways its cast didn't wholly click. I think it needed a bit of rectifying to modify its taste to be something clearer or more entertaining.So true that there was a silly unnecessary commercial about shampoo at the end. But there was also a moment in which finally someone declared it  I saw that movie before. The black dude dies first. As you see, according to this last irony, it gives itself nearly the 6 out of 10.

I liked this movie the first time I watched it, and feeling nostalgic, I rented it again. Boy oh boy, what 6 years between viewings will do.This movie tries too hard. Tries to hard to be thought provoking, sci fi, comedy, and fails massively on all levels. I cannot believe Julianne Moore agreed to this, I guess i've had my palate spoiled by seeing her better movies. Orlando Jones plays a lecherous community college professor/women's athletic coach. The implications of him trying to get into the pants of barely legal college students dominates the movie, offers no plot point or advancement and leaves you with an awful taste in your mouth. Seann William Scott is being, well Seann William Scott. I can't say I was disappointed with him as he basically is playing the same character he does in everything else i've seen him in. This leads me to Duchovny.For an actor who was trying to distance himself from his work on the XFiles so he could spread his wings as an actor and explore different roles he sure didn't go to far. He goes from playing Sci-fi alien butt kicking Agent Fox Mulder to playing Sci-Fi alien butt kicking Ira Kane. The only real difference in the characters is occupation, name and partners (replace Scully with Orlando Jones.) Way to go David! (And no, he shouldn't live that down!!)Here's all you need to know Aliens are undergoing Evolution at an alarming speed, and threatening to wipe out life as we know it. Enter Fox Mulder, the pervert coach, Stifler, Moore and Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dumb. (2 students who are also volunteer firemen.) Out of all the people on the planet, they figure out how to kill the aliens. And they do, in one of the most laughable, badly done, anti-climatic CGI effect you've ever seen. That being done, Mulder & Moore disappear to get it on in a nearby firetruck. The End. Oh, there's also a big product placement for Head & Shoulders. If it sounds dumb, that's because it is. This coming from the man who brought us GhostBusters, a far superior film in both story and effects. If you're really hankering down for some good Sci Fi or Alien type of things, i'll suggest to you the actual XFiles. There's 9 seasons of them to pick from where you can watch Duchovny in his original alien seeking, conspiracy theorist paranormal investigator role. 2/10 for Moore and for Seann William Scott, who is at least not pretending to be anyone else.

He expressed some of the mix of desperation, anger, but mainly disbelieving shock I experienced when confronted with actors I loved involved in a *non-movie*.I'm really trying hard to find something positive to say. The special effects sometimes were good. In certain action scenes, sometimes there was rhythm. Some brief shots of Julianne Moore smiling were nice.But what is worse than a movie trying to be funny. Sometimes you hear dialog that is perfectly funny - potentially. And somehow, the movie manages to choke it to flat-line. Bad editing, bad directing for the actors both Duchovny and Moore have nothing to prove... and let's not even recall Dan Ayckroyd also got entangled in this mess somehow. If this movie has nothing to offer but the sadness of a doom, it's neither their fault nor any of the other excellent actors who in any given other flick are allowed to contribute to the collective effort.I saw this when it came out, and watched the end on TV again tonight, just to be sure...

And, of course, I remember coming out, shaking my head in disbelief at the fact I couldn't think of ANYthing in the movie that even remotely held the promise of the poster. (the fact that that three-eyed smiley doesn't play any role whatsoever in the movie just exactly depicts how wrong the whole thing is)No movie ever made me feel like this one money spent on nothing, actors I admire wasting their time, becoming aware a director can use his power to prevent a 90 minutes movie from being anything the whole time through.I still can feel how it was to see this movie.

The results are startling as Kane discovers an alien life form which can evolve & adapt at an amazing rate, soon the Army becomes aware of the meteorite & takes control of the situation as a whole mini alien eco-system is growing at a tremendous rate in the caves. As the strange alien creatures within begin to find their way to the local town a way must be found to stop them before they take over the entire planet...Co-produced & directed by Ivan Reitman I think Evolution is one of the best sci-fi comedies I've ever seen & for that I apologise to no-one. The script by Don Kakoby, David Diamond & David Weissman originally started out as a straight forward & serious sci-fi thriller film but once Reitman came on-board he developed the comedic aspects which makes one think he wanted to do another Ghostbusters (1984) which is easily his best & most successful film to date. Anyway, it has a definite Ghostbusters feel in it's deadpan humour & slimy monsters everywhere but Evolution is a great film in it's own right. For a start Evolution is surprisingly funny, I find a lot of Hollywood comedies to be moronic but Evolution works really well & the light hearted script has a nice balance between the humour & more serious sci-fi side of things. The film is quite epic in scope with a whole town being overrun by alien monsters & an entire alien eco-system trying to take over which I think I might be right in saying is an original concept, can you think of another film that uses it? I thought the idea in itself was clever & keeps all manner of alien beasties coming thick & fast. The character's are also very likable, Duchovny & Jones as the two scientists in particular have good chemistry & work well against each other with Duchovny's deadpan delivery & Jones' more eccentric performance. It moves along like a rocket, the alien meteorite crashes to Earth during the opening credits sequence & from that point the film never lets up. A class film, if there is anything to dislike about Evolution I haven't discovered it. Forget about the obligatory 'this is the worst film I've ever seen' threads on the IMDb message board, every film ever made seems to have one.Director Reitman does a great job, he keeps things moving along nicely & he handles the special effects scenes well. The effects are a mixture of puppet & on set creature effects which are brilliant & the expected CGI computer effects which are also top drawer, it just goes to show if you have literally millions of dollars to spend on your effects then you can achieve some spectacular results. From flying reptilian Dragon like aliens to living plants to alien spiders to alien fish to a huge gigantic walking blob at the end, all the aliens look fantastic & are a nice mixture of the cute & the creepy. I liked the ending too, the way they wanted to be celebrities & as such ended up doing commercials.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 Evolution was a well funded film & it show's, it looks great with fantastic special effects & spectacular alien monsters. The acting is good from the main cast, I admit I've never liked Julianne Moore in anything I've ever seen her in but she's tolerable in this. To to reinforce the Ghostbusters theme Dan Aykroyd has a funny cameo at the end as the state Governor.Evolution is a brilliant sci-fi comedy & it's as simple & straight forward as that, I loved it. Again this is just my opinion because there's plenty of 'this is the worst film ever' type posts on the IMDb but I honestly think it's a fantastic film from start to finish in just about every respect. Followed by the Saturday morning cartoon series Alienators Evolution Continues (2001) which ran for 26 episodes & features both Ira Kane & Harry Block.

Director Ivan Reitman made Ghostbusters about twenty years before he made Evolution and although it's been a while since I saw Ghostbusters, I can remember enough to suggest that Evolution sorts of feels like a 21st Century version of the now rather iconic, albeit for puzzling reasons, Ghostbusters.Evolution is fast, fun and sort of dumb but it knows it is. It uses some of the oldest ways of both telling a story and how to present characters to the audience; what I'm getting at here is the 'buddy' combination which was very popular and rather successful during the 1980s, coincidentally round about the time Ghostbusters was proving to be such a hit. What I liked about this reference or perhaps 'spoof' at times is that Evolution recognises what it's doing The white guy named Ira Kane (Duchovny) and the black guy named Harry Block (Jones) are the two protagonists combining for the duration and Block consistently references the way the buddy genre works giving a very post-modern feel to the film. He states that he's 'seen this movie the black guy dies first' when faced with a could-be dangerous situation; he also falls foul of most of the jokes in the film The flying bug just happens to get into HIS costume; he has the job of going up the massive alien's anus in order to fulfil the goal and of course, there's never enough time for lubricant whenever the coloured guy's on the operating table &#150; typical.Evolution seemed to have a plan and it stuck to it throughout. The film is a comedy but it's also a rather frightening horror film in the sense we see so many nasty things happen that it's tempting to look away out of knowledge that we have no idea how bad the consequences might be. When that flying bug gets into Block's suit and we see it 'inside' him, it's grim but funny; likewise when that monster comes out of 'a water hazard of the fourth green', grabs a sexually active character and drags him back into the water, it's pretty grim but it's funny because he leaves grassy trails with his fingernails along the pristine putting green a post-modern touch as it looks like it's straight out of a Tom & Jerry cartoon.Evolution is at its core, a comedy because there aren't as many 'scary' moments once the film's narrative is developed into something more serious. The whole idea about visitors from outer space is appealing and fun with the speedy growth the aliens make also interesting as well as unpredictable I got the reference to 2001 A Space Odyssey when they mutated into primitive men and were suddenly hostile. Unfortunately, Evolution becomes a very tired film when it enters its final thirty-five minutes or so. There is an amusing if not anti-climatic scene in a shopping mall involving a creature that's a cross between a raptor dinosaur and an eagle that has no bearing on anything what-so-ever and Allison Reed's (Moore) quote about how 'as soon as they (the aliens) take America, we're extinct' is basically two fingers up at every other military any other country has which was disappointing. If Evolution was a house of cards then this quote is the jolt that causes it to sort of collapse a little the 'race against time' is tired and familiar, the plot point written on the back of someone's T-shirt is bizarre and the whole product placement of a certain shampoo leaves a hell of a lot to be desired.Despite this; Evolution is a good film for what it is exploring some themes such as greed and envy and whether or not if extra terrestrials did land here, how much would it be worth to keep quiet? It's sort of funny, sort of scary and sort of clever but many people will consider this film to be a complete waste of time.

I'm not usually a credits watcher but a lot of the tunes were replayed over the end. Well worth letting them roll with your eyes closed and the volume up.David Duchovny Funny. Better than in Playing God. A little inside joking about his X-Files day's. He looked like he was having fun - as did all the rest of the cast.Julianne Moore, I think plays somewhat against type. I haven't seen that much of her work but what I have seen has been of a more dramatic nature. She was wryly funny and it's fun to see a serious actress just do some bits and have some fun. (Are we detecting a trend here? Fun?)Wayne the Fireman-wanna be. He is an archetype - everyone at one time or another has known Wayne. Everyone has known the blustery, clueless police lieutenant and the witless, large, 'clean and shiny' brothers and Ted Levine as General Woodman, the military bad guy archetype. I've seen some complaints about Levine's performance as simply playing the stereotyped bad guy, but just as he is for Detective Adrian Monk, he was an admirable foil/straight man for Duchovny. I can't really think of who would have been a better General Woodman to Duchovny's Ira Kane.As for the Governor - it was nice to see an older Dan Akroyd do his schtick. His performance was less intense than his Bassomatic bit but I think Dan nailed the good old boy, get-to-the-point, smooth-but-bossy politician, as only Akroyd could do it (and minus any hint of a Chicago-land accent).And finally, the lamented (in some few comments) performance of Olando Jones Orlando is Orlando. Orlando playing against type...I can't even imagine that in this movie. This was not the vehicle for Orlando to make a run for an Oscar. I thought, in a sense, he and Duchovny took turns playing straight man for the other and THAT was fun to see. Seven Up Yours, Orlando. You make me laugh.It is simply a nice, escapist bit o'FUN for an evening when the World seems to be tearing at its guts and I really don't want to have to think about anything other than Ivan Reitman's players in the Arizona dessert, battling something out of this world. Call me irresponsible. I had been plugged into NPR for most of the day. I think sitting down with my 9 year old son and having some good laughs was like taking a shower from the grit and grime of the World's problems. I'll get back to the World's issues tomorrow and that, my friends, will have to be soon enough.So have a nice, thoughtless bunch of laughs; have fun and escape the troubles of this world for 90 minutes, give or take.

It's light, it's gross, it's a little spooky at times and pretty silly other times. It's never actually hilarious but it IS watchable and entertaining. I like the leading lady in this- she's yummy and 'ol Dave from X-files fame is always a good comedic talent smart ass. They have nice chemistry. I guess this is targeted as a family movie you can take teens to but I think some teens have a high potential of being bored by this. The feel of it sort of reminded me of gremlins with the whole town turned upside down by an infestation of occasionally (mildly)humurous monsters.Serious sci fi fans will be miffed by the humor, people looking for a comedy won't find one- this is sort of a middle of the road kind of thing but it works. Occasionally our politically correct inclusion of a comedic relief non-threatening black man in a positive role gets about as tiresome as Jar-Jar banks, but Dave Duchovny's quick wit smooths over his occasional lameness.I was annoyed at several moments that revealed a low level of intelligence from the script writers including contrived plot twists with zero logic that kid-gloved what should have been a rather nice chunky and bloody scene. I would have appreciated a little more legitimacy and only using jokes that were super funny. This is overall, a sophomoric movie at best but it's still kinda watchable in a dorky sci fi kinda way. This is basically fodder for a Saturday afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel- keep expectations low and you will be mildly amused.

This is a horrific movie with few redeeming values. The script regularly bends awkwardly to catch, continue or introduce story lines, standard themes like romance seem thrown in for formula's sake and carried horribly throughout. It will even resort to crotch hitting site gags and tried and true music sequences that are thrown in out of the blue and have no bearing on anything, to fill in large and I mean LARGE empty spaces. Also, the chemistry,heart and genius of the original Ghostbuster ensemble is nowhere to be found here. I find also that accuracy is imperative in whatever kind of story you are trying to tell and a comedy should not be given carte blanche simply because it is a comedy. I'm not expecting nano-tolerances on factual information but this film trounces all over basic expectations with regard to scientific procedure. A little more effort on this front would have added to the credibility of the humour. (This was definitely part of the magic of the original Ghostbusters, Egon Spengler's dead pan delivery of highly accurate scientific information added to the suspension of disbelief and was integral to the overall contrasting aspect and the movie's humour.) This film also has a heavy reliance on cheap stereotyping (dumb cops, stiff military types, and fat-stupid rednecks), again to fill in the spaces. Laughing at someone being stupid is the lowest form of entertainment out there and the first tool of assembly line writers and directors. This looks really insulting to the skills and reputations of Duchovny and Moore often look like strange people in a strange land trying to carry this off.When I read good reviews for this on IMDb, I have to wonder, are there people out there being paid to post good reviews? It would seem an excellent way to promote a film, disguising it in an honest forum and would reach enough people to keep the video rental numbers afloat for years.

It is also far funnier than the woeful GHOSTBUSTER movies to which it is frequently compared (it was initially intended as the third in the series).   Taking all the elements from classic 50s Sci-fi flicks, then acknowledging present-day paranoia in the form of a bullying military (who are nevertheless portrayed as stereotypical buffoons and/or incompetents), director Reitman more or less hits all the targets at which he aims.   And while the humour isn't consistent (it never is these days) the film has such a pleasingly light touch that you're willing to overlook the slower sections.Orlando Jones is amusing as geologist Harry Block, while Duchovny plays Fox Mulder as a failed college professor, which was probably what was asked of him ('I don't trust the government,' he knowingly declares at one point, 'I know those people.').   Julianne Moore displays a pleasing comic touch in what is sadly an under-developed role, and is possibly the only major actress who manages to look like a normal person in her movies.

It's all executed fairly well, and it's worth a look if you're a David Duchovny fan; for those familiar with X-FILES, his droll and low-key performance will be old-shoe comfortable, but it's still hard not to think of Bill Murray - who can get away with such things much easier because his whole persona has that slightly disconnected from reality vibe - when Mr. Duchovny tosses off insouciant one-liners in the midst of world-threatening chaos.  One might wonder how Julianne Moore, luminous as always, found herself in such a lightweight project, but even here she demonstrates that she is incapable of being anything less than wonderful.

Director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Meatballs, Twins, Kindergarten Cop) can't seem to make up his mind if he wants it to be a straight science fiction flick or a parody.  The result is a film that is far too goofy to be good science fiction and nowhere near funny enough to be good comedy.A great cast is wasted on a script that lays one unfunny egg after another.  The only one able to squeeze any comedy out of his lines is Orlando Jones.  David Duchovny and Julianne Moore mostly try to play it straight and Ted Levine plays his part as too much of a doofus.  Seann William Scott is occasionally so bizarre that it is humorous, but mostly his character is more stupid than funny.The one strength of the film is the visual effects.  The monsters are innovative and realistic.  The scene where the flying reptile is terrorizing the shopping mall is particularly good.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the creatures.  It seems like it may have been written as straight sci-fi and Reitman (more of a comedy director) futilely tried to change its direction.

(minor spoilers)","Date":"28 December 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" Ivan Reitman, director of 80s blockbuster 'Ghostbusters', creates an entertaining but formulaic science-fiction comedy in 'Evolution'. David Duchovny plays a college professor, Dr Ira Kane, who investigates a meteor crash along with his colleague, Dr Harry Block (Orlando Jones), in the Arizona desert. They discover that the meteor is a life form and is evolving at a rapid pace. The military eventually quarantines the crash-site under the control of General Woodman (Ted Levine) who Kane used to work with. Woodman, assisted by scientist Dr Alison Reed (Julianne Moore), prevent Kane and Block from entering the alien site which is slowly evolving. Although Kane is strangely attracted to Dr Alison Reed, he and Block infiltrate the site after the military steal their initial documentations. Eventually Reed, Kane, Block and a wannabe fireman, Wayne Green (Seann William Scott), work together to battle weird alien creatures as the evolving crash-site spreads into the town.After an awkward beginning, 'Evolution' becomes quite funny in parts, especially during a scene where Block (Orlando Jones) has an alien bug enter his body. Seann William Scott is also quite funny and David Duchovny plays his usual dead pan self, but it works well within the comic context of the film. The visual effects are very cool, with some interesting alien characters appearing throughout the film adding to the comic aspect as well. At times, 'Evolution' feels awkwardly paced and formulaic in it's script, and the romantic angle between Julianne Moore and David Duchovny's characters does not really work! Reitman's 'Evolution' definitely beats out his last two duds, 'Six Days, Seven Nights' and 'Father's Day', but doesn't quite live up to 'Ghostbusters'. It's entertaining to watch and has some genuinely funny moments, but 'Evolution' is not a riotous comedy. The science fiction element is blended well, but it is not a must-see for the big screen as the visual effects can equally be appreciated on video. Worth seeing if you have seen everything already, or if you're particularly in the mood for light-hearted science-fiction comedy. *** out of *****!

He in turn goes to two community college professors to investigate the meteor's crash, and it appears that the meteor has made a home for itself. But it's only a matter of time before the meteor begins to take shape and begins evolving years beyond any normal evolution. Leaving the three men and a government scientist to stop it.The Review Evolution was made in the midst of the impending actors strike, which never came to fruition. So the feeling that it may have been a rushed project is fine. The film is the latest in a long line of comedies to feature gross jokes, such as an alien anal probe, mooning, and pulling out a bug where the sun don't shine among many others. It plays off as a kind of Ghostbusters with a different twist. Mind you, Dan Aykroyd pops up in an unbilled role as a state governor. The special effects are quite impressive involving CGI aliens and creatures. The film is pure slapstick with the sci-fi twist. However, what's not good about Evolution is it feels half-assed, therefore reitering the point that this film was a rushed project. It feels like it was sped up for the benefits of cashing in but the film flopped at the box office. The ending is capped on and it just doesn't feel satisfactory. But on the other hand, Evolution is a funny movie because it relies on the chemistry between David Duchovny, giving Fox Mulder a dynamic personality, in which his character moons a government official, and Orlando Jones (The 7UP guy) as Duchovny's spastic best friend, a geology professor who's also a women's volleyball coach.

And it's not hard, because a number of elements seem to have found their way from Ghostbusters into Evolution - the strong female lead, the wacky professional scientists, the won't listen man in charge, and Dan Aykroyd. Ghostbusters was an ensemble piece, three comedians who had worked together for a long time and who could play off one another. Not so with evolution. So much of the friendly banter seems forced and artificial, and Orlando Jones' cliched one-liners only slow the scenes down. Something was wrong with the editing, though I found it hard to put my finger on it - like the editors (both experienced people, I might add) had left a few too many frames on either side of a cut. Other scenes - such as the argument over the shirt between Duchovny and his ex in the cafe - felt like they shouldn't have been there at all. It was clear seeing the end sequence that great chunks of the film had been removed, but whether they were the right chunks you'll have to decide for yourself. The effect is a slow and choppy film. Now, it is supposed to be a comedy, but a little scientific accuracy wouldn't go astray. Not some argument over the atomic weight of Nitrogen, but something as simple as these creatures can't possibly survive in our atmosphere... We got some of it, but not much, and what we did get left me shaking my head in bewilderment. I assumed that was what Scott's character was there for - to have things explained so the audience would understand. As it turned out, Scott's presence was essentially a plot device. The best bit? Aykroyd's appearance. He waltzes onto the set and out-acts everybody on screen, and looks like he has a lot more fun doing it too. Only Julianne Moore manages to match his enthusiasm. Duchovny's character seems to pull the solution to their problem out of thin air, which grates badly. These characters aren't smart, they're lucky. Disappointing? You betcha. And not just because of the high standards set by Ghostbusters. This film has its own set of problems. "},{"Title":"EVOLUTION? What evolution?

So together with the discoverer of the meteor, pool-manager Wayne (Seann William Scott) and the clumsy epidemiologist Allison (Julianne Moore), they set out to stop the life forms on their own.The director of Ghostbusters, Ivan Reitman, has taken his successful formula and converted it from the 80¬¥s to the new millennium.

A premise that had the potential to develop into a truly great film. Unfortunately very little of this potential is ever realised on screen. Instead what we end up with is a Porkys meets Independence Day mish mash that does nothing for the careers of anyone involved on set.Guys if you're going to do a teen comedy please don't use a good storyline like this. Do a Tim Burton and shoot a 'Mars Attacks'. I like others here wonder why Duchovny ever agreed to be in this film. Most of his time he plays the part of a lame straight man while the buffoons around him react to a possible alien invasion by cracking bad one liners and doing infantile sight gags. And the supposed love interest between Duchovny & Moore looked like it was cut and pasted in from a B grade script writing programme.   In spite of the fore mentioned Evolution wasn't the worst film I've seen this year. It did have it's amusing moments and the special effects were spectacular. I just would have liked to have seen this film made by someone like Ridley Scott.

Certain movies just aren't there for criticism, they *are* pure entertainment (for some, as the Pearl Harbor comments here have proven), and this is one such film, as you can imagine from the excellent poster (still gotta get me one of those).It's from the same director of the 80s 'classic' Ghostbusters, and he hasn't done anything quite as memorable in between. Evolution has elements of movies like Galaxy Quest, Men in Black, and Independence Day, but resolves itself in the manner of what could have been a South Park movie sequel.A meteor arrives on earth, and single cell organisms inside of it begin to evolve at a phenomenal speed (millions of years in a couple of days). Ira Kane (David Duchovny) and fellow college professor and cheerleading coach Block make the discovery but, inevitably, the info finds its way to the government (Kane used to work for them until he gave a large portion of the army 'Kane's Madness'), at which point Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore, doing comedy again, at last) enters the movie. By this point the organisms are almost human, with a few dinosaur type creatures (the effects are *amazing*) thrown in for visual spectacle. All comes to a head when the military decide to napalm the meteor site, just as Kane and Block discover that fire will turn the organisms into... well, you'll have to see the movie to discover one of the most shamelessly hilarious final acts since, well, South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut.The score is by John Powell and the cinematography by Michael Chapman. I note these two since they seem to have reversed roles. John Powell used to do Hans Zimmer type clones for movies like Face/Off and Antz, yet here he produces something which, though familiar, I found to be pretty astounding and will likely be getting the soundtrack. Michael Chapman, on the other hand, is one of the greatest modern cinematographers and seems, in my opinion, to be wasting his time on a visual effects extravaganza like this. Where's Raging Bull and Taxi Driver?Evolution was always to me the most reliable Summer movie, and it delivers more than expected. Though the Tomb Raiders and the Pearl Harbors have big bucks for advertising and stars, this one struck me as a firm concept backed by a capable crew. That it turns out having the audience I was in laughing their heads off every 5 minutes is, in this typical Summer of flaws, reassuring indeed.

Compared to Men In Black (a comparison that has shown up here, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why), it's better. Men In Black couldn't seem to decide whether it was a comedy or a serious movie, and this movie embraces the comedy. The plot is cliched, yes.  The aliens 'evolution' doesn't seem to follow a real pattern, and some of the lesser creatures were much more frightening than the ones in the later parts of the movies.

Orlando Jones was a little too wide-eyed and wild at times, but other than that managed to credibly play his role (particularly during the insect extraction scene).If there's any complaint I can have, it's that the romance seemed rather tacked-on.

After all, it was made by Ivan Reitman, director of Ghostbusters.I came away from the movie theater trying to justify what I had just seen. And I only felt better when I accepeted the fact that the movie was, well... kind of a failure.First, the good parts. It *is* a tribute to Ghostbusters. How much, you say? Well, it has a Slimer catching scene (the one with the pterodactyl look-alike), the ending is basically the same, and it has tons of green goo. The main characters are professors at a university. The government agents are, in fact, the bad guys. The list goes on, and on.Now, the bad. Ghostbusters had lots of laughs. This one has lots of forced laughs. When a good director has to resort to flatulence jokes in order to bring out forced laughter from his audience, you know he is way past his prime, or that he couldn't do too much with the material. I think this is evidence of the former. The movie had lots of potential, but it was basically treated as a rehash of a good film.Add to that null character development, in which all of them disappear and reappear on screen almost at random, tremendously unbelievable situations, and way too many jokes that fall flat on their face, and you get a not-so-good movie.And lets not forget the comment of the brainy doctor, when she observes that in 1 week the aliens will invade Arizona, and in a month they will be in all the US, therefore annihilating humanity. Someone should tell her there is life outside the US border. Oh, well. At least the aliens didn't speak english.

That movie was a masterpiece of genius. Evolution is nothing but a fun ride that comes nowhere near the class of Ghostbusters. But it's still well worth it.Weird really when you consider that Ghostbusters Go to Hell, the second sequel in which hell got so full that spirits started spilling out into the real world, was re-written and redrafted that it became this...something completely different. You probably know the story. A meteor crash lands in the desert and the single celled organisms living on it very, very quickly become multi celled and then little worm creatures and then...many other things. The movie repeatedly calls them aliens but since they evolve from nothing on earth and are conditioned by earth's environment they are, effectively, earth creatures. Watching them run riot and cause havoc is the main fun of this film.Ghostbusters had a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, like a fine wine. Evolution has a crude, gross-out sense of humor like American Pie, which seriously lessens the overall quality of the film. The lead trio of actors perform rather well together. Duchovny is much looser and easy-going here than his stiff, X-Files character. Seann William-Scott once again plays a dufus but he's more endearing here than he has been in other roles. Orlando Jones is kind of good but he too often takes his role in the stereotyped 'only black guy in a white movie' direction. Sadly though, Julianne Moore's accident-prone scientist just isn't funny and her clumsiness seems false and forced.But obviously when you judge Evolution next to something better it seems an inferior movie. Judge it on it's own terms and you'll definitely enjoy.

Here is an enormously underrated actor who steals the show even when he's not onscreen, so we can only hope to see a lot more of him in the future. David Duchovny is perfectly cast as the geology professor at the local city college who is on the scene to investigate a mysterious asteroid that has landed on earth and seems to have brought with it some astonishingly quickly growing and evolving organisms from an unknown origin. His history from the X-Files gives him the perfect mixture of seriousness since he just has that voice that makes anything he's talking about sound mysterious and other-worldly, and at the same time it gives him a great opportunity to make some nice inside jokes about his iconography (`I don't trust the government, I know those people.').Julianne Moore is the place where the movie really trips up. She is a tremendously talented actor, and is given a role that is immensely below her. She is there literally for no other reason than to have a love interest for Dr. Kane (Duchovny) and so that she can, for some reason, trip and fall flat on her face for some completely unknown reason every once in a while in the movie. Seann William Scott, the single reason to watch crapfests like the American Pies and Road Trip, is given a role that reduces him to goofball comic relief spouting bad jokes (`That's like a big loogie!') that are funny almost not a single time in the film. This guy was side-splittingly hilarious in some of his previous films, even the bad ones (which was most of them), and he is a hugely talented comedy actor, but he just had nothing to work with here. Maybe they should have let him write his own part.The aliens themselves are remarkably interesting, given the way they grow and evolve at such an alarming rate and the things that they grow into. There is a lot of creativity there, even though a lot of it goes way over the top and there are occasional special effects that are just not convincing enough. The idea of having the aliens being unable to tolerate oxygen was a good one, because when aliens are introduced from another world, you can't just have them running around killing people, there have to be some rules that the humans can work with in fighting them so that they're not just freaky looking bad guys. An intolerance of our atmosphere gives them character and gives the humans an edge. The way that they conducted experiments (purposely or otherwise) to see what killed the aliens was some of the more interesting parts of the movie, although their weapon against the biggest baddest aliens at the end of the film was a little too goofy, even for a movie like this.Evolution is a very rare kind of film, placing itself among very few colleagues in a genre almost entirely its own, the science fiction comedy. It has the cast to create this kind of film successfully, but some of them, mainly Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott, are simply misused and do not fulfill their entire potential. If a little more work had been put into their roles, the movie could have been immeasurably better.

Unfortunately for us, it just doesn't connect on the same level as Ghostbusters did. The formula is almost exactly the same, right down to the Saturday Morning cartoon, but the polish just isn't there.That's not to say it's a bad movie. I really enjoyed myself, and it's unfortunate the movie tanked - I liked it enough to the point where I'd love to see a sequel, with Ira and his 21st Century Ghostbusters traveling around, cleaning up the leftover evolutionaries. If you can get past some bumpy patches, this is a very watchable movie, and very recommended to fans of the Ghostbusters series.

As much as I love Ghost Busters I and II, this is a movie I can watch over and over again.The set designs and special effects are fantastic. The music by John Powell is dynamic and thrilling. The chemistry between the characters is delightful, including the two fat guys who turn out to be far more intelligent than the audience realizes. Dan Aykroyd is fabulous as the governor of Arizona. Every line he utters is hysterical. Dan improvised most of them during filming.The film works perfectly as a comedy, but it also works extremely well as a sci-fi adventure/thriller. In fact, the story was originally conceived as a serious sci-fi thriller, but director Ivan Reitman wisely realized that a comic version would be much better. As one of the millions of intelligent people who realize that the theory of evolution is actually just a joke that Charles Darwin never intended for anybody to take seriously, this movie does a fabulous job of demonstrating just how ridiculous it is to believe that complex lifeforms could accidentally develop from simpler organisms. (Just try demonstrating this moronic idea in the laboratory. Good luck, pal . . . )As a true fan of the best of the 1950s sci-fi films, Evolution is the perfect ancestor to movies like the Harryhausen classics like It Came from Beneath the Sea and 20 Million Miles to Earth, and director Jack Arnold's two best films, It Came from Outer Space, and The Space Children.Ironically, the people who criticize this movie often seem to do so because they object to the fact that the science is inaccurate. Ivan Reitman states on the commentary track of the DVD that he took great pains to get the science in he story correct, including the use of science advisors. It's obvious that these people's objections are based on their pathetic defense of the totally illogical theory of evolution (pause for chuckle).It you don't like Evolution, try rethinking your personal philosophies. As soon as you get them right, you'll love this movie.

However before they can tell anyone they find that their specimens have become multi-celled organisms. Returning to the meteorite site they find that the place is alive with complex life and flatworms. At this point they are locked out by the US military and have to try and break back in past General Woodman and clumsy scientist Allison Reed but it isn't long before the creatures they are trying to study and freely accessible and moving within the community and continuing to evolve to our world.Without a great deal of fuss or hype, Evolution opened up in the UK and maybe it was because I had no specific expectations that I managed to enjoy it for what it is &#150; a silly comedy that never takes itself seriously at all. The plot basically sees aliens spreading across a small desert town with only a ragtag handful of local teachers and a wannabe fireman seem to be able to tackle them. It is nonsense of course but the tone suits the material and you never think that it is expected you to do anything but laugh and go with it. As such the film is very much the Ghostbusters 3 that some other reviewers have called it &#150; it is funny, tongue-in-cheek but still managing to be still exciting and engaging rather than just being too daft for the audience to care about or get involved in. The writing helps by being quite irreverent, while the direction (and I'm not a massive Reitman fan) deals well with the mix of action and comedy.The cast really helps and the majority of them have really got hold of the tone and have understood what is required of them. Duchovny has particular fun sending up his X-Files scientist role and greatly enjoys dealing with aliens without the serious tone &#150; it is a shame that he doesn't seem to have been able to capitalise on this venture and so far he is still in the shadow of his most famous role. Usually Orlando Jones is terrible but here he is used just right and brought several big laughs out of me (specifically the line there's ALWAYS time for lubricant which cracked me up); Duchovny may be the star of the show but Jones tends to scene-steal when he gets the chance &#150; even if he does have a bit much to do with anal action for my taste! Moore is sadly wasted in a role that lumbers her with clumsy, unfunny pratfalls that never work and it is only really where she just blends into the group that she manages to give an OK performance; it is just as well that she is such a fine actress but on the evidence of this, comedy is certainly not her thing. Scott does his usual stuff with all that that implies and he works well within the film even if he doesn't make that much of an impression. Support from Levine, Aykroyd and others is pretty good throughout. The special effects do vary but are mostly enjoyable and work well enough within the context of a comedy sci-fi, although some viewers will fine the usual problem with CGI looking much more like it exists on another plane rather than working within the film.Overall this is the sort of film you need to be in the mood for as it will please you if you let it but may also annoy you if you come to it with high hopes so my advice would be to try and watch it without any hopes. It is very silly and never takes itself seriously but it is also pretty funny, energetic, exciting and enjoyable. Hardly high art but a funny sci-fi that will please those that enjoyed Ghostbusters.

Ghostbusters flew because of the VERY funny people involved, not necessarily because it was better written - which it was. The only MILDLY interesting aspect of Evolution are the Sci-Fi elements. They really start to go somewhere, but fall apart about half-way through. Don't waste your time on this one. "},{"Title":"Ghostbusters meets Men in Black","Date":"15 May 2005","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" When Ivan Reitman directed Ghostbusters (one of my all time favourite comedies) in 1984, it was the runaway hit of the year. And with good reason. It combined cutting edge special effects with a terrific troupe of comedians from Saturday Night Live, and redefined what mainstream comedy could be all about.But since then, Ivan Reitman's career has been decidedly uneven. With Evolution, he has made a welcome return to form. Although it doesn't come close to eclipsing Ghostbusters, this amiable comedy is an amusing and inventive film, and one of Reitman's more well rounded comedies of recent years.Like Ghostbusters, Evolution is about a group of scientists who take it upon themselves to save the world. But not from the supernatural. This time the threat comes from the stars.Our story begins when a meteorite crashes to Earth in the Arizona desert. Inside the meteor are alien cells. Once they've arrived on Earth, they begin to evolve into all manner of different creatures. First it's just little things like worms and insects. But they start becoming more dangerous and intelligent. Things like amphibians, reptiles, primates, and eventually an enormous blob (don't ask!).The task of stopping these aliens has fallen into the hands of disgraced scientist Dr Ira Kane (David Duchovny) and the kooky Prof Harry Block (Orlando Jones). Two scientists who don't exactly inspire you with confidence, and if truth be told, seem a little half-arsed about everything. That's not surprising, since Reitman never portrays scientists as egg-headed geniuses. More like eccentrics only marginally more intelligent than people you'd meet on the streets. That was the way it was in Ghostbusters, and that's how it is with Evolution.Ira and Harry are joined by a sexy (and clumsy) scientist Dr Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) and trainee fireman Wayne Grey (Seann William Scott). Our hopeless foursome are all that stands between the aliens and Earth's extinction.It's impossible not to compare Evolution with Ghostbusters, because barring the fact the threat is alien this time, the plot is virtually identical. A group of scientists are called in to save the day. CGI creations running amok, and turning into something enormous they have to defeat to save the world.That's not to say its a terrible film. Personally, I don't mind if directors use the same sound ideas, just as long as they find a new spin on them. Although Ira and Harry don't have the crackling chemistry the Ghostbusters had, they do make a personable double act. David Duchovny has a real talent for understated comedy. His dry wit almost reminds you of Bill Murray at times.Orlando Jones is more zany but there are times when he really cracked me up, especially the scene where he has a pair of forceps jammed up his arse to retrieve a pesky fly inside his body. The two actors work well together, and they are rather endearing, so that's definitely a positive.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott. Moore is rather flat, and never comes across as funny. For some reason she thought the idea of being an accident prone scientist would make people laugh. Quite frankly I don't know how Julianne Moore ever agreed to sign on to this project. A great actress like her deserved much better.And as for Seann William Scott, well I've never been a fan of him anyway. He always seems so obnoxious to me, which is why I didn't like the American Pie films all that much. He doesn't really add anything, and his presence was probably just a marketing ploy by the producers to bring in a teenage audience as well.I know I sound like I'm riffing the film, but Evolution does have it's strong points as well. The CGI effects are top notch, and we really do get a colourful assortment of creatures in this film. Personally my favourite part is when an alien dinosaur swoops into a shopping centre and makes off with a shoplifter. Ira, Harry and Wayne's rescue of the girl is one scene that recaptures the spirit of Ghostbusters, and then afterwards when they're on a high listening to Play That Funky Music it's not only funny, it fills you with a warm fuzzy feeling.It also has a nice line of supporting characters. Dan Aykroyd puts in an hilarious appearance as the Governor of Arizona. He has the self important befuddled politician stereotype down to a tee, and lights up the film whenever he's around. I also liked Katharine Towne as Nadine, one of Harry's students. She only gets a couple of scenes, but she's very funny as a prissy Valley Girl.Inevitably, things come to a head with the aliens coming together to form a massive blob (as I mentioned before). This giant monstrosity is not nearly as memorable as Mr Stay Puft, but at least it gives the FX technicians an opportunity to make the ending look impressive. Our heroes chosen weapon is Head and Shoulders (believe it or not!). That's not as preposterous as it sounds, especially from my perspective, who has used Head and Shoulders in the past, and knows exactly what it can do!Evolution was sadly not the success Ghostbusters was. It's not so surprising really, because Evolution was probably trying to cash in on the success of other recent sci-fi comedies like Men in Black. But Evolution is still an entertaining film, even if you don't root for these characters like the Ghostbusters.One thing I do like about Evolution. The Smiley face logo with the third eye. Now there's evolution for you Charles Darwin!

AWFUL. I mean, it's unbearable, I got really frustrated when I watched it, believe me, it's really really bad... mmkay? I wont go into any details here, but everything else, except some of the monsters, is extremely bad. I'm 26 years old and I must say that this movie ruined my day completely... Maybe it wouldn't be SO bad if you're 12 or less, but there's so much out there that's at least watchable so, please just stay away from this f****** movie... Thank you! "}]
