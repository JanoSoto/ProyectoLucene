[{"Title":"A greatly overlooked movie.","Date":"2 December 1999","Score":"14 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Western","Review":"  This movie is one of the best comedy westerns for a long time and gives its stars ample time to perform.Paul Hogan plays pretty much the same character as he did in Crocodile Dundee, only with a bit more heart, as a failed outlaw trying to make a name for himself in the Wild West with one big heist. His only partner is played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in a superb early performance as a dumb black shop assistant, with shows both comedic talent, and a depth to the character that Hogan himself probably didn't know was there when he wrote it.A series of wonderfully scenes in bars all over the West, culminate in a perfect last heist that nobody knows about, and robs Hogan of his wanted fame.Unfortunately, the box-office showed less confidence in the movie than it's investors on the Aussie stock-market did, but do not let that deter you from a very funny movie.

I never use to be that big on Paul Hogan, I never liked him all that much to be honest. But not after watching this. This movie was funny say the least, And when I first pop ed in the movie I was thinking that it was going to be some old movie that was just thrown out there in hopes of having a little money. But Honsitly I was surprised , it was enjoyable, and it wasn't boring. I also liked the idea that Cuba Gooding Jr's Character, wasn't able to speak, and how Lighting Jack wasn't able to read without his glasses , but how he tried to hide it from everyone. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, and they like a good comedy, or Paul Hogan for that matter. What are you waiting for....? Go rent it !

He contemplates retirement, but before that can happen he has one final wish to make major headlines. When a bank robbery gets bungled, he takes a mute store clerk (Gooding) hostage, but they unexpectedly bond, develop a genuine friendship, then try to help each other out by forming an unlikely partnership to pull off a big score that will attract the necessary attention. The two leads make a surprisingly engaging team, and there are some enjoyable moments, but the whole thing is familiar and obvious. **Â½ "},{"Title":"Formulaic comedy western","Date":"16 April 2002","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Western","Review":"  Basically a standard western story with a few gags thrown in, this is alright if you're a fan of either star but doesn't really do much, Hogan is just a slightly pathetic version of his Crocodile Dundee persona, an outlaw who never quite makes it to the big time fame he's always longed for, while Gooding does another soppy turn as a mute who communicates by gurning and simpering. But it's fairly easy on the mind if you've got a couple of hours to kill.

A robbery leads to him kidnapping a young black mute man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). They become the strangest of friends and have the wildest adventures as they try to become known criminals in a time and place that just does not seem to care about them. High-class prostitutes Beverly D'Angelo and Kamala Lopez-Dawson are also along as the duo's love interests. The film uses its gimmick well early, but then starts to drag as it hits its latter acts. Hogan and Gooding make a surprisingly impressive team, but really they were not given enough material to run with. The rest of the cast is touch and go as once again Hogan is left to carry a production and he is only minimally successfully. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

It though a lot of the well known and established formulas and is neither better nor worse, than a lot of other comedies out there. Paul Hogan stars as Jack Kane a veteran outlaw who finds himself part of a dying breed an unable to get a decent headline. Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as the mute clerk Ben Doyle who wants to join up with Kane and become an outlaw.The acting is average. Hogan seems to run on much of his routine from Crocodile Dundee. Some of the time though he seems to have trouble delivering his lines convincingly. Cuba Gooding Jr. is amusing as the mute Doyle but occasionally overacted to the point where it made me cringe. The chemistry between the two isn't bad, but it isn't great either. Much like the film itself.There's nothing noteworthy about the direction or cinematography. The story moves along alright, but the script is mediocre and gives us a few completely unnecessary scenes. There is rarely any musical score to take note of, and what little there is, is average stuff to enhance the comedic elements.The film is not a complete waste of time. Some of the jokes do hit their mark, and Hogan has charm. There are several better Western comedies out there though, such as Maverick, but if you're looking for some mild entertainment some rainy day, Lightning Jack can prove to be entertaining enough.

Not particulary funny or clever, but it passed the time. Cuba Gooding Jr was very good considering he wasn't allow to talk at all. Even Paul Hogan was didn't ham it up too much.It isn't a great western or a great comedy but it isn't bad and, unless you pay to see it, may even leave you with a half-amused little smile.

Hogan is funny as usual in the title role of gun-waving, but short-sighted bank thief Lightning Jack, who takes mute, but smart Cuba Gooding, Jr. as his assistant and tries to escape the law (Pat Hingle & Co.) while flirting with Beverly D'Angelo. The mediocre script doesn't work, some gags work, others don't, the direction by Simon Wincer is boring, but Hogan's charisma holds it together for most of the time, although Gooding, Jr. does some good scene-stealing.

Not too many of them are about the old west It's also not a mix that really ever works out, without becoming a spoof of the genre and use all of its formulaic elements.The story seems to lack a clear purpose. It's hard to say what the movie is really about and were its heading to. One top of that, things just don't ever flow well in the movie. Everything seems to happen suddenly and without a reason for the rest of the story.On its comical level its also a rather weak one. For a comedy it surely has some few real laughs. It's one of those comedies that keeps you waiting for a punch-line that just never comes. On top of that the situations in this movie just aren't humorous. Guess they thought that the movie would already be strong and funny enough by making it a buddy-flick, about an old bandit and a mute bandit-wannabe. Paul Hogan isn't too bad in this movie, although he was clearly far too old for his role at the time. He provides the movie with its best comical moments and some good funny dialog. The Cuba Gooding Jr. character is a bit of a weird one. He's a mute who works at a store and he obviously feel that he is above the simple town-folk and then for some unexplained reasons decides to become a bandit and team-up with, the obviously incapable, bandit Lightning Jack Kane. It also makes you wonder what's the challenging thing for a character to play a mute character. Cuba Gooding Jr. really isn't a bad actors but he too often appears in such weak movies and uninteresting comical roles, that it makes you wonder why he keeps doing it. Guess that he just has fun playing in these type of movies. I'm happy that at least someone had fun. Pat Hingle is also in this movie, in a typical Pat Hingle role. Too bad that they didn't gave his character more screen time, though they potentially really could had done that.The movie is rather good looking and it doesn't look like some cheap attempt. The costume were especially nice. The musical score on the other hand didn't seemed fitting. It's one of those simplistic scores that sound as if it was completed months before the movie finished shooting and therefor doesn't fit or add anything to the images.Has its moments but overall a below average and totally uninteresting comedy attempt.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"The fall of Hogan's career","Date":"12 January 2014","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Western","Review":" Paul Hogan is just a one trick pony. He can only play Mick Dundee and that's just about it. He decided to play Mick Dundee as an outlaw and it didn't work. It's just really, really, really boring and unfunny. I can't think of one joke that made me laugh. Maybe Aussie humour and American humour don't mix.Cuba Gooding Jr as a mute was the only good thing about it. I really liked his character and this was the beginning of Cuba's career. Sadly he did suffer from the dreaded Oscar curse and did terrible movies. That's why being an movie star sucks, folks.Paul did do Flipper (which I haven't seen in ages) and later Croc Dundee in LA (which was bad, but not as bad as this flick).

Beverly D'Angelo is wasted as the clean-as-white-bread-whore-with-a-heart-of-gold - stick to the Vacation movies, Bev!Honestly, this isn't as bad as I had expected (it used to have a 3.6/10 rating on IMDb and was on the low 100 - its rating has now risen considerably over the past few years) but it's still extremely poor by almost any standards and I think I smiled once, chuckled once or twice, and laughed zero times. It's not funny at all, and even as a lazy Sunday afternoon flick it barely delivers. "}]
