It was an incredible mesh of the high-brow and the low-brow.It had one character who was extremely foul-mouthed, and kept making up hilarious obscene phrases. It also had a lot of perceptive, biting (and very funny) theological and social commentary.For me, it was sort of like being tickled hard in the ribs for about an hour. When I reached the breath-taking climax of the film, the resolution was such a shock and was so unexpectedly emotional and I was so sore from all the laughing, I actually burst into tears. Now, dammit I am a grown man. I never do that. Not even for anything real, much less a movie. But it happened.

It's a theological reflection...and a call to the Church to focus on things that matter (like living life to the fullest, helping those in need, honoring and respecting all, expecting respect in return) rather than those that don't (like...well, dogma doctrines/church laws or any belief that causes us to draw a line in the sand, condemning to hell or perdition any who disagree with us).  As I watched it (the first and all subsequent times), I felt sure that the movie was written by someone who really loves his church -- but is smart and aware enough to recognize its shortcomings, its blindspots, even its failures and hypocrisies.  Rather than simply leaving or ignoring or dismissing it, Smith chooses to enter into dialogue with it, using the potent medium of film to do so.  One can only hope that the church--not just Roman Catholic but all branches of it-- takes him up on his call to conversation.Not to be missed in the film, on a lighter note, are the introductory disclaimer and the Thank Yous at the end.  Smith thanks Elaine Pagels, for God's sake -- who knew anyone in Hollywood read contemporary, feminist theology?  What a welcome revelation....

Dogma's topic was a very sensitive one and could have been misused but Kevin Smith has dealt with the subject perfectly. Anyone who has critisized Dogma for being offensive has really not understood the film. Dogma is full of excellent moments, not least Alanis Morissette who I thought was fabulous in her small but important role as 'God'. All the performances were excellent and the actors complimented each other superbly. Overall this film has a mixture of everything and its underlying message is one which should reach everyone.

Not that some of the negatives mentioned by other posters here aren't true -- yes, a lot of the humor is gross, yes, the F-word is overused, yes, its criticism of organized religion is less stinging that you'd expect (though that in itself is a slightly foolish expectation, given that the writer/director is himself an active member of an organized religion). And yes, if you're not Catholic, much of the movie is a little foggy, under-explained, and not very engaging. That last one I definitely agree with; I seriously doubt whether I'd recommend the film to a non-Catholic at all.But, oh, God, I LOVED it, serious flaws and all!  It's a huge chaotic mess with about sixty different trains of thought and philosophy, from the ecstatic to the scatological, slugging it out for dominance, and in its very sloppiness there's a sense of anarchic, exultant wonder I've never seen in a movie before. The only two things like it that I can think of are Thornton Wilder's play Skin of Our Teeth and G.K. Chesterton's amazing joyous fever dream of a novel The Man Who Was Thursday, both of which are works by people who may or may not have faith but who definitely have a good idea. Or several dozen of them, and who just run with them wherever they go. These works are big chaotic messes, but in that way they are mirrors of Creation, the mother of all big chaotic messes. In all these works, just as in the real world, love and joy and beauty and filth and cruelty and despair are constantly tumbling over and bleeding into each other; the one universal rule is that everything is absurd, that the human race is the most absurd thing of all, and that this absurdity can be the catalyst to either suffocating grief or a kind of hilarious wonder.If you go into Dogma expecting a trim and tidy theological comedy of manners, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for something with the same filthy gorgeous lunacy of existence itself, this is it.

However, it also expands on the direction he took in Chasing Amy by dealing with subject matter and concepts that are personal and thought provoking. Dogma goes beyond the dick and fart jokes, which are reassuringly present, and gives the viewer something to think about.The film deals with thoughts on religion, Catholicism mainly, in a way that pokes fun at the institution but does not deride it. Dogma is by no stretch of the imagination an anti-Catholic movie. It embraces religion and points out the potential and actual problems that can occur within any religious institution. The film's comments and contents are definitely meant to be taken with a grain of salt.The cast is great and there are many instances of hilarious viewing, usually Jay and Silent Bob, as well as very sensitive and expressive moments from the various actors.In the end, Dogma is a thoroughly fun and thoughtful viewing experience that both old and new fans will enjoy. A movie outside the typical fare that is worth spending your money on seeing.

Jay has some of his laugh out loud funniest one liners yet. But what really makes this a great film is that it is genuinely thought provoking.There are religious people out there who will criticize this film as being anti religion, anti Catholicism, when it is anything but (well, a little anti Cathlic maybe). The central theme to the film is that there is a God, but not the God that most people know (or think they know) or believe in. The characters in the film are trying to get the message across that people have changed the original God, man has made God into the image they want him/her to be, made their own religious rules, rules that God never intended. From a strictly biblical standpoint, Smith is right on, which is not something that can be said about many films dealing with religion. And isn't that the entire point to Christianity, that it's based on the bible.

As a recovering Catholic, I remember the teaching of the church that I could basically sin all I want, but if I repent at the end, I will be saved and go to heaven. New Jersey is reputedly the home of many undesirable criminals with vowels on the ends of their names - maybe some of them even relatives of mine - and I know they are predominately Catholic. I am sure they are counting on this escape clause, just as Loki and Bartleby were counting on the same thing.Yes, while I was laughing, I was also carefully looking at the images the golden calf (money) we worship and listening to the lines.

Smith plays textures like a cardshark - from action sequences to philosophical debates to stoned one-liners to dramatic monologues, the action flows remarkably smoothly for all of the twists that are thrown at it.  I was also extremely impressed by the tasteful execution of the more violent scenes, where the graphic aftermath may be shown, but the action happens off-camera.  One rough point was that a great deal of dialogue came of as expostiory - there was simply such a massive back-story (2000 years of religious history...go fig...) that it seemed at times that the plot had to fight its way through the background information.  One particular shot also irked me - in the Bethany/Metatron scene in the cafe, every time the camera cut back to Bethany, she seemed to be in the exact same pose, and break it in a very similar way.  I wonder if this was intentional, or if it was a continuity issue?  The casting of God was simply inspired - her appearance was actually one of the highlights of the film.  Towards the very end, there were some surprisingly touching moments (of course rendered through Smith's unique style), and the closing scene felt like something right out of a good ol' 80's movie (that's a good thing!).  Issues and all, a truly enjoyable film!

Even though the movie is almost two and half hours, it delivers enough philosophy to keep people thinking long after watching it.  Was Jesus Christ black? and Is there someone out in the world that is a direct descendent of Mary and Joseph? are very thought provoking.The satire elements in this movie are well done.  I thought the edition of George Carlin as the self-centered Cardinal Glick was an especially nice touch.  I am a George Carlin fan and I have heard his routines about taxing the properties of the Catholic Church.  I think the issues with race and women in the Bible were dealt with in a fine way as well. The dialogue was smart and witty and the cast did particularly well.  Jay and Silent Bob took the movie with their wise-cracking, foul-mouthed wit and humor.

It's more the second-long ha! kind of comedy.That simply means Kevin Smith's writing is clever enough to the point where you will be pleasantly shocked by some of the conversations and events of the film and think it all rather amusing and humorous. It's not hilarious, it's just clever and a bit funny.The premise is rather interesting and surprisingly from a more fantasy-esquire genre than Smith traditionally dabbles with. Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are more or less fallen angels that have found a way back into heaven. They must be stopped or the world will come to a screeching halt, so a seemingly random protagonist named Bethany gets charged by God to stop them. Simple, but the slick, nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.The film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself, which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations to-the-point and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock, who plays an apostle, and Alan Rickman, who plays God's messenger/ voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.Getting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way, the conversations and the philosophy that come about, that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general, Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general, the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written, which keeps the film interesting.It's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events, but Dogma is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.

I had heard of Kevin Smith's cult following and had experienced the wonderful ride that Chasing Amy was. To add to that, the concept behind Dogma was pretty darn cool. The cast was big, the canvas huge, and the agenda enormous. But none of it could salvage this sinking vessel. All the king's horses and all the king's men, and so forth.Kevin Smith's greatly touted skill has been his dialog. He is arguably among the finest pens that write long-winded tirades, witty comebacks, and insightful observations. Remarkably, Dogma showed an utter lack of sophistication or tact. The moments that made me laugh could be counted on the fingers. Of one hand. Of E.T. I have seen the man in action not more than two days ago, when he had come our university for the third run of his An Evening with Kevin Smith show. I just can't imagine how someone who had our rapt attention for five whole hours could come up with embarrassing dialog like in this film. The trite and corny lines almost overloaded my Cringe-o-meter.The whole affair had a thick coat of amateurism on it. No doubt, films such as Clerks and Chasing Amy aren't known for their polish and slickness, but this film has the sensibilities of a high-school production. Blocky edits and choppy transitions make an already tedious film all the more unbearable. The characters are mere sketches, with a pretense of a background or a personality. It almost seems like everyone's just being themselves while knocking off a few beers and reading out the lines half-assed. It is hard to believe anyone took anything seriously on the sets.Dogma begins with a few disclaimers about how it is supposed to be humorous and not intended to offend anyone. I seriously doubt anyone who sees the movie would be offended by it. Except perhaps fans of Kevin Smith and the discerning members of the audience. The philosophy presented in the movie is so thin you could have it instead of the Atkins diet. I have heard deeper words from people who have put a gallon of beer behind them. I am sure some (or most) of the ideas have come from such evenings of drunken revelry.This is a film without redemption. Quite unbecoming for a film that (almost) embraces the teachings of Christ.

She has to stop two fallen angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) who have found a loophole that they can re-enter Heaven but if they do that they would destroy all of existence because God's word is meant to be infallible. Fortunately (or unfortunately) Bethany is joined by Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), the thirteenth apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock) as Loki goes on a killing spread and a demon called Azreal (Jason Lee) tries to make Loki and Bartleby success in their objective.Dogma is a sharply written comedy that is constantly funny. Smith makes a dialogue driven comedy filled with comical exchanges and great character inactions. Smith's trademarks of film related dialogue and jokes at the expense of Jay, but the best parts is the satire of religion and his showcasing of knowledge of Catholicism, combined with clever lines about the religion.Sometimes Smith does stand on his soapbox about religion, but for the most part the satirical jabs are one target. We get satire from all angles from a Cardinal trying to get the church to appeal to younger worshipper, by doing it in the most patronising way, including a 'hey Jesus' and comic book art for its title 'Catholicism Wow'. There are criticisms about how The Bible has be rewritten to suit certain groups, with the Bible being whitewashed (though ignoring that Jesus and the apostles would have mostly have been of Middle-Eastern appearance) and women having villainous roles.Affleck and Damon were great together as the fallen angels, having great dialogue and discussions, particularly in the beginning and a scene in a boardroom for a children's character. Alan Rickman was also a comedy highlight, playing against type as the Voice of God, someone who has great lines and adds serious emotion depth when needed. He added gravitas and gave the role his all.Kevin Smith has often stated that he thinks he is not a particular good director, but with Dogma he is able to keep a fast pace, he knows how to shoot the dialogue sequences and can add a scene of tension when needed (i.e. the boardroom scene). Smith is competent with the action sequence at the end and he knows how to use his bloodpacks. The general look and tone of the film where Reaper (which Smith directed the pilot) got its influences from.The film does occasional take a misstep, such as Smith being at time very preachy and there is a demon made from faecal matter which was very immature and out of place for a smartly written film.On a final note, Howard Shore of the Lord of the Rings fame provided the score for Dogma and much his other work he gives Dogma a top score. He uses plenty of choir beats and singers to add to the experience.Dogma is a highly enjoyable comedy that is intelligently written and very funny. It is a film deserving of its cult classic status.

So Bethany is all the more puzzled when she's approached by Metatron,a grumpy angel.Metatron wants her to help him stop Bartleby and Loki, two fallen angels who were ejected from paradise, have escaped from exile and are heading to New Jersey. If they are able to pass through the arc of a certain church, it will prove God is fallible and the world will come to a swift end. Bethany has no idea what to do or why she's been given this project, but she heads out anyway, with her assigned assistants Jay, an appallingly rude former dope dealer and self-styled ladies man, and Silent Bob. Along the way, Bethany picks up more helpers, including a celestial muse named Serendipity and Rufus, who claims to have been the 13th apostle and that Jesus owes him 12 dollars.It is about the importance of faith, if not organized religion.I echo Kevin Smith's statement about this film.It is a talky, farcical comedy of cosmic errors is clever. But it's clever in a deeply juvenile way.As God would probably say to the viewer,Thou Shall Not Stop Laughing.Overall,it is a push-the-envelope coarse, thematically ambitious, and most dangerously self-consciously respectful and thoughtful on matters of faith and religion.

I watched this expecting to chuckle, instead I came out feeling nauseated and patronised. At least half an hour of the film -AT LEAST- is spent with characters explaining the plot background and details to other characters. Can you say yawn? This is the first Kevin Smith movie I've seen and the man is the biggest overwriter I've had the displeasure of coming across. The characters just cannot shut up! This would be fine if the dialogue was witty or insightful, but instead it's lots and lots of swearing (the word f~ck loses it's already minimal impact after the fiftieth time you hear it in one scene), and supposedly deep religious discussions that are immature and sound as if they were written by a twelve year old who just became interested in theology.It's near impossible to see who this film appeals to- Smith shoots for pleasing all and ends up satisfying none. Those who enjoy the childish, Dude Where's My Brain jokes will no doubt be crushingly bored when the characters decide to sit and talk inanely about something unfunny -AGAIN, while those who like the pathetic attempts at religious satire and discussion of the Catholic Church will cringe at the afore mentioned poo monster and a succession of equally puerile kindergarten comedy.The film is nowhere near as clever or anarchic as it thinks it is (indeed it has incredibly tame messages), and the characters are obnoxious. The protagonist -a female, distant relation of Christ- whinges so damn much you want to slap her overacting face. Indeed, pretty much every person in the film overacts- only Alanis (the only person with no lines- significant?) and Salma Hayek (who's a decent comic performer- `That's why he's The King, and you're a schmuk') come out with dignity intact. I should also say Silent Bob's expressions are pretty amusing, as are the odd one liners in Jay's rants. However, while Ben Affleck isn't as bad as he can be, he's still pretty terrible, and Matt Damon does an impressive impression of wallpaper throughout. When the film shoots for drama it's embarrassing. When the two fallen angels have an argument and one compares the other to Lucifer, we're supposed to take it seriously, but the poor writing and acting make it an utter non-moment. At one point, the protagonist, after another annoying rant (which I'm assuming is Smith's amateurish way of getting across how his characters feel, as this is an insanely whiny bunch of people) actually runs, drops on her knees in the rain, and screams up the sky `WHY, GOD!?!?!?! WHHHHHHHHHHHY!?!?!?' This was one of the only genuine laughs I got from the film, it's an utter cliché and this supposedly ironic, clever-clever film tries to use it as drama worrying.Again, I ask, who actually found this controversial? Bible Belt Christians? Devout Catholics? Those same groups find 'HARRY POTTER' controversial, it's hardly an achievement. The only other thing I could see as being controversial was the pushing of the pro-choice abortion movement, and while I am pro-choice, such plugging made me uneasy, as pro-lifers are demonised in the film somewhat unfairly. If Smith is going to enter the abortion debate, which is inadvisable in the first place for a film most likely to appeal to wannabe `alternative' folk gagging to prove their anti-establishment leanings, it should at least be fair and give the points of both sides. It's also obvious that the man directing is a Catholic himself, and the film comes across as just more self-loathing, rambling apologies from a liberal, middle-class, white male for the perceived wrongs his ancestors have done to the world. If there was any satire in the film, I didn't catch it- was the scene where God made all the bodies disappear satirical? Worryingly, it appears not. Besides, satirising the farcial exploits of the Catholic Church is about as hard as exhaling carbon dioxide.The film, though, isn't a total waste of time. There are some nice points- the boredom of church-going is articulated adroitly, for example, and there are one or two funny moments. The conceit of the relative of Christ not being able to have children and thus losing faith in God is actually a great idea, but it's poorly executed in the extreme. The dialogue/writing is terrible for the most part (the characters talk too much about the story and/or themselves, and do too little), the acting equally dire, and -most criminally- it's simply not funny. `Dogma' commits the ultimate sin for a movie packed with such dumb jokes, it sure takes itself seriously. If you want to watch a comedy, a satire, or even a discussion of religion or theology, there is surely better stuff than this.

It uses abnormally foul language. It's crude. It's irreverent. It's completely wacky and also part of the 'Askewniverse' (where you basically have to watch Smith's other films to fully appreciate all the gags here). It is definitely an acquired taste.However, if you can overlook the language, the daftness and generally light-hearted mockery of organised religion, Dogma really is something different.For a start it has an all-star cast, not all of which are fully developed, but it's great to see so many talented performers on one cast list. Secondly, it's original. It's safe to say not many films are about a rag-tag bang of religious warriors are trying to stop two exiled angels from returning to heaven in case it destroys the very fabric of the universe. And, finally, it is genuinely funny. The banter - albeit sweary and sexual - is well-written and amusing.Although, you may have to have a reasonably broad sense of humour to fully appreciate this. For, even if you find the banter funny, it is pretty dark. Surprisingly, it does get pretty violent in places.So, if you're looking for some surreal, violent, foul-mouthed, smutty black humour, then this one is for you. Or, just watch any of Kevin Smith's other 'Askewniverse' films. If you like them, you should like this. The Life of Brain it isn't, but it's a different take on the misconceptions created by organised religion.

The cast were all great and each of them brings something to the table. This is more than a journey movie about getting from point A to point B to accomplish a mission. But more so on the interaction between the characters that adds to it's humor and wits. It just seemed like Kevin Smith put a lot of his own thoughts and philosophies about Christianity into this. Which he does in a lot of his movies, excluding the Christianity part. It's a intriguing movie that some Christians may agree with and others will disagree with but most will at least will be intrigued with. It's a movie with cleverly constructed satire that takes on more of the modern street angle to Christianity. This had potential to be better if it had more exploration on intellectual parts and how to expand on that. Even if the overall plot doesn't make much sense when it comes to God. But maybe I am just being a bit nit-picky. Overall this is a movie that the audiences could have a entertaining time with, even the Christian audiences if not taken way too hard.

Dogma (1999)...","Date":"28 April 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" (I'm not Catholic, nor do I know much about Catholicism, but I am convinced that God does exist, and, and, He/She does have a sense of humor. I mean, She would have to, especially after seeing this movie...)First off, a little bit of history...If I can recall correctly, Kevin Smith's 1999 Christian satire Dogma was the first movie of his that I ever saw, and was my introduction to the witty New Jersey born & bred Gen-X filmmaker. Over the subsequent years, I came to watch his 1994 debut feature Clerks., Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), Red State (2011) and my personal favorite of his, Clerks II (2006).Smith, who can at best be described as a lax Catholic with a unique perspective of his own faith (that may ruffle a few feathers, i.e., the more devout), threw all these unique perspectives - and then some - into Dogma, which like every other faith-based movie to ever come out of Hollywood, caught a wrath at the time of its release that can only be described as biblical in its nature, with the usual protests, boycotts, and calls for Smith's Head on a Silver Platter (you get the point). He would later revisit religion once more with his horror film Red State, which sought to play up the issue of religious fundamentalism in all its forms (and also, quite literally, I might add, allowed Smith to have the last word on all matters of faith).But even Smith himself knew what he was getting into at the time, and like he clearly states during the opening credits, even God Herself has a sense of humor, i.e., why wouldn't She smite Smith down where he stood behind the camera by allowing the late comedian George Carlin (an avowed atheist) to play a New Jersey-based Catholic priest in the film? Dogma centers around the two fallen angels Bartleby (Smith regular Ben Affleck) & Loki (Matt Damon, another star-powered Smith regular), who hope to get back into Heaven by exploiting a newly discovered loophole in Catholic dogma.So what? Two angels banished to Wisconsin want to get back into Heaven? Big deal, right?Wrong.To do so, would be to eventually reverse a divine decree that the pair never be allowed to re-enter Heaven (and when the Apocalypse comes, they have to sit outside the Gates for the rest of eternity - zing!!!). This would essentially prove God wrong and because God is infallible, this would thus lead to the complete undoing of all of existence (the end of the world, again, remember). To do this, the Seraphim Metatron/The Voice of God (Alan Rickman) is dispatched to Earth to recruit Bethany Sloane/The Last Scion (Linda Fiorentino), an abortion clinic worker (double-zing!!!), to go to New Jersey and stop Bartleby & Loki from re-entering Heaven (a Catholic church - triple-zing!!!).And of course, Bethany has plenty of help. So, aiding Bethany in her God-given mission also are Metatron; two prophets - and stoner slackers - Jay (Jason Mewes) & Silent Bob (Smith himself); Rufus (Chris Rock), the so-called thirteenth apostle; and the super-sexy Earth-bound muse Serendipity (the super-sexy Salma Hayek).Dogma is not a movie for the faint-of-heart (or the most easily offended, i.e., the ones who probably need to see this movie the most but obviously won't), like most Smith movies are. It's got much of his usual down & dirty (yet witty) dialogue and post-Gen-X attitude, but it's also got heart and plenty of clever insights into some of the problems surrounding organized religion, Christianity (and Catholicism), in particular. Smith probably knows better than anyone that religion itself is not perfect, and he's not afraid to ask important questions that could lead to constructive debate about the problems inherent in faith and come up with solutions to try to fix them, rather than just continue to follow religious dogma blindly. It must be reiterated that in other words, Kevin Smith is not hating on religion; his lax faith is just as important to him as it is to anyone else; he knows it's not perfect and can just see the humor in it all.Dogma is perhaps Kevin Smith's most mainstream feature - and his most controversial, however needlessly so. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are what hold this feature down; although they're the bad guys here who realize their selfish actions could cause mankind to instantaneously cease to exist, we get to see that they are indeed two complex characters who can be sympathized with, though to a degree. Smith clearly wrote these two with quite a bit of care and affection (in fact, all the characters in Smith's movies can be said to have been written with plenty of care, affection, and heart). Linda Fiorentino (who was allegedly cited by Smith to be quite difficult to work with) is this story's emotional anchor and the one we forge the strongest connection with. Like Jesus Christ Himself (this connection becomes clearer two-thirds of the way through the picture), she's carrying quite a significant burden on her delicate shoulders to save the world. It's a lot of quality acting on her part, however problematic she may have been for Smith behind the scenes.It's been quite a while since I last Dogma. I was only 14 when this movie was released and even then I just saw the humor and vulgarity that is typical of much of Smith's work. Having seen it again today for the first time in ages and with much clearer eyes, I can say that this is perhaps his heaviest piece of cinema, and was equally embraced and judged by people on both sides - like any quality piece of art.As it stands, my top-four Kevin Smith movies are Clerks II, Chasing Amy, Clerks., and Dogma.10/10 "},{"Title":"Snooch to the Nooch","Date":"11 April 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" One of director Kevin Smith's better films, Dogma stars Linda Fiorentino as an abortion clinic worker who finds herself locked in a bizarre adventure featuring Jesus Christ's black disciple (Chris Rock) and two renegade angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon). The always disgruntled Alan Rickman co-stars as an always disgruntled henchman of Christ.Like Quentin Tarantino, Smith's films are packed with monologues, rambling conversations and incessant nods to pop-culture. Unlike Tarantino, Smith's films languish in the warm memory of teenage adventures, college humour and bizarre penis jokes. In Dogma these traits are elevated by some superficial but heartfelt attempts to grapple with theological issues (Smith is a devout Catholic). If the film ultimately fails as satire, it nevertheless works well as an odd slacker-movie. Affleck and Damon are devilishly riveting as a couple of murderous supernatural beings, and Smith regular Jason Mewes, a real life stoner, is hilarious as a foul mouthed dope-fiend. As Christian mythology is inherently nonsensical, Dogma can't help but be anything but reactionary. Smith's Christ may be a woman (Alanis Morisette) whose principles are antithetical to the corrupt organisations set up in her name, but her mysterious ways are still totally nuts.8/10 - Like him or loathe him, Kevin Smith was one of the more distinct voices of 1990s popcorn cinema.

The story is highly entertaining, captivating, and full of interesting plot developments.Ben Affleck and Matt Damon each delivered us great performances, especially when being wrathful or witty.

Alan Rickman was hilarious as the complaining neat freak. This is the type of role I think he's best with, the funny sarcastic kind.

Now, this star studded cast doesn't even end there. There's also Janeane Garofalo, George Carlin, and Alanis Morissette in a surprise supporting role of no little importance.Now, the only thing negative I would have to say, is that the CG and some of the set are not up to part with the rest of the movie.

I read somewhere that this is a thinly veiled propaganda for catholic church, or Christianity in general.I don't see it that way at all. First of all, the surface is not thin at all. There are layers and layers of clever gags, dark humor and satire in this ride of pursuit.The main premise is relatively simple - two rogue (or rejected or whatever) angels live on through present day, still doing what they've been doing throughout the Bible and trying to get back to heaven. Their only way to do it is through a loophole in catholic dogma, which, if exploited, would prove that god is fallible. For that they must be stopped and an earthly creature is recruited for the task. There is little time and thus the pursuit begins. During it various biblical elements come into play through their present-day form.To some Dogma was eternal biblical struggle relived and modernized to better adjust to modern viewers. There are some argument in favor of that view. I'd say that the sheer fact that it's a satire (some poignant moments notwithstanding) and the campiness of realization actually tell the opposite tale. They show how this stuff the legends are made from (and still worshiped) fares when viewed through a prism of real life.The two archetypal angels may have been prosecutors of evil in the Bible, but in real life they are just two self-righteous angry mass murderers. A biblical monster is in real life just a pile of crap, a dangerous one but crap nevertheless. God may be an infallible, omnipresent, omnipowerful creature in the Bible, but in reality its set of values, rules and powers are more becoming of a pop star than of a being that supposedly created everything. In fact you have to wonder about the power of god that has to follow rules.Other various gags and skits, such as the black apostle (13th one at that), play on a virgin working in an abortion clinic and the other ones only reinforce the sense of unsubtle ridicule. In that regard Dogma did and will repel many a religious viewers and stir certain controversy.

Kevin Smith's style of using conversational humor and trying to make the audience feel like a fried of the characters in the movie doesn't really work with topical humor.

Set in the director's beloved home of Red Bank, New Jersey, Dogma's central plot line revolves around two diabolical quasi-angels, Loki(Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) cast out of heaven and sent into the only place they could be banished to more unbearable than hell- Wisconsin. Discovering that the fallible dogma in a certain Red Bank church will allow them to re-enter Heaven if they arrive there on a certain day, they head down eager to return to the Pearly Gates to wreak more havoc. The person best suited to foil their plan is Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino), an abortion clinic worker who is revealed to be the last descendant of Jesus Christ- the reason why the neurotic Metatron, the winged Voice of God (an absolutely uproarious Alan Rickman) appears in her bedroom to recruit her. Along for the ride (Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Smith's recurring slacker characters Jay and Silent Bob, with larger roles and, in Jay's case, funnier dialogue than ever), and Rufus, the outcasted black 13th Apostle (Chris Rock, whose screechy style does little to detriment the delivery of his high-quality jokes.) Meanwhile, a sinister plan involving total destruction is being hatched by the demon Azrael (Smith regular Jason Lee) and his three frighteningly sephulchral, hockey-stick-wielding lackeys. Showing up for cameos are George Carlin as the loopy Cardinal Ignatius Glick, promoting a toothily-smiling, thumbsup-flashing buddy Christ, Janeane Garofalo as Bethany's fellow abortion clinic worker, and Alanis Morrissette as a quirkily ecstatic interpretation of a female Big Boss.Smith's dialogues is typically phenomenal, with very few jokes falling flat (an uninspired s**t demon sequence is made up for by the collection of witty dialogue given to Rock, Mewes and Rickman- and Smith's Silent Bob is so cool that he commands mention.) The cast is unanimously effective, with the four actors quoted above giving particularly enjoyable performances. All in all, a twisted Catholicism  satire to be cherished. 84/100, ***1/2, A- "},{"Title":"One of the best of 99","Date":"6 June 2000","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Kevin Smith director of Clerks and Chasing Amy brings us a movie about two fallen angels who discover a loop whole to get back into Heaven, and if they do it means the end of existence.

It does this through the use of comedy and what can only be called blasphemy of Christianity.The film claims Jesus was a black man but the people who translated the Bible where racist, it also claims God to be a woman and that the same people are sexist. However the way in which it makes these claims is in a way so absurd that I think its nearly impossible for anyone to be offended, it is not meant to be harsh on religious people it is merely Kevin Smith's way of exploring the subject of religion in a comic way.The acting in the film is all good, but director Kevin Smith as Silent Bob, and Alan Rickman as the Metratron are the two stand outs, even though Rickman only has about two minutes on screen, and Smith says all of two words.Many of the funniest moments in this film are stolen from other films for example when Silent Bob throws Loki and Bartleby off the train looks at the passengers and says 'No Ticket.' I instantly knew it was the same joke used in one of the Indiana Jones films although I can't remember which one, however this doesn't matter I knew the joke sure but in the new context it still made me life, particularly as this was the first and only line Silent Bob has in the entire film.The only let down of the film is perhaps the sub-plot of the Jason Lee as the evil Azrael is a little under-developed and amongst everything that was going on I kind of forgot about him until his showdown at the end with the Holy Bartender joke which is hilarious.Dogma is a fantastic film with good performances, a great script and unlike many of other comedies something to say about society. If you want to have a good laugh at God and the Bible then definitely watch this film; if you are a religious fanatic then perhaps watch something else as this could be very offensive.9/10 "},{"Title":"One of Smith's better efforts","Date":"28 July 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" You either go with this movie's sense of humor or you don't. Kevin Smith, a pretty proud Catholic apparently, wrote this screenplay as a way to sort out his feelings about Catholicism at a time when he wasn't too enamored with the Catholic Church. Despite a lot of criticism and protests from Catholics at the time of its release, Dogma is really more the product of someone who clearly believes in the basic ideology of Catholicism than anything else. As a theist who finds Abrahamic religions fascinating but doesn't choose to belong to any specific organized religion I found Dogma had a fair bit to say and did so quite well given this is a movie featuring a rubber poop monster. It's a silly movie from start to finish and loses itself towards the end but the script is for the most part quite good. The cast are all solid and Smith's work as director is functional as always given that he's essentially just recording people's conversations for the film's running time and attempting any artistry wouldn't suit the movies he's making.7/10 "},{"Title":"Great film, not up to the standard of Smith's previous work","Date":"24 January 2001","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Those of you who are fans of Kevin Smith's previous works (Clerks, Mallrats & Chasing Amy)may find this area familiar in some parts and unnerving and perhaps even commercial by comparison. Dogma sees fallen angels Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon)attempting to make their way back into heaven via a newly instituted catholic dogma. The problem with this lies in the fact that if they are successful, they would have overturned a ruling by God, hence God is always right and if proven wrong would result in the undoing of existence. The familiar presence of Jay and Silent Bob is comforting and ensures that some of the essence Smith's earlier work stays put, however at times this film dissents into areas that seem out of Smith's depth. There are some surprisingly touching moments which implies that Smith gave a great deal of thought, similar to that of Chasing Amy. In general it is a great all round cast, (Linda Fiorentino,Chris Rock, Alan Rickman) and it is obvious that whilst writing this Smith had his tongue firmly in cheek. "},{"Title":"Glib monologues are no substitute for dialogue","Date":"11 January 2000","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Kevin Smith has talent, but Dogma does not reflect it.  The film, while trying to be interesting, falls flat for several reasons The characters, the script, the editing, the plot, and the theological inconsistencies. Aside from these problems, the film has some merit.The range of characters has not grown since Clerks.  While Jay and Silent Bob are funny, they soon become a standing joke that grows tiresome. Does every film require them?  I appreciate how Hitchcock always put himself in one scene in his movies, but Kevin Smith is beating this concept to death.  The other characters are interesting, but the film never develops them. Linda Fiorentino's character, the main character, is developed to two dimensions but it is difficult to sympathize or identify with her character. The peripheral characters have less development and appear as vehicles for monologues rather than possessing any depth.The script, which was written before Clerks, shows its age and its lack of development.  The cast is the best of any Smith film, but the script does not do justice to their talent. The central problem is that Smith has the tendency to write short monologues rather than dialogue.  Smith attempts to weave together monologues in the hope that he can make something develop. At times this has worked brilliantly, see Clerks, but in Dogma, it simply detracts from the film.  I suggest he study the screenplays of Elmore Leonard and David Mamet to gain a feel for how to pace and develop dialogues.  He needs to expand his writing capabilities to encompass narrative if he is ever hopes to write a successful drama.  If he continues to make films that never escape the script formula of Clerks, he will never grow as a writer.  Chasing Amy nearly escaped at some points, but it failed because Smith could not decide to write a drama or a comedy.Smith has an excellent grasp of the everyday life's banalities that often pass for depth, but his screen writing lets him down.  Will every Smith film treat us to Star Wars references or apparently glib monologues where a character deconstructs a well known icon with the assumption that they are saying something profound?  See Loki's first monologue. Characters seem to have suffered lobotomies because they cannot see through such superficial analysis. To continue to write such monologues and assume that it passes for dialogues is a waste of talent.Only two actors seem to escape the monologue trap Alan Rickman and Linda Fiorentino.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon try to escape and in that attempt they demonstrate their acting talent. However even they succumb.The editing breaks down from time to time. For example, the film jumps from an impending bar fight to corporate boardroom without sufficient transition.  While the boardroom scene was insightful, worshipping the golden calf, the scene dragged after that point. The scene does not add to our understanding of the film.  The final scenes also suffer from editing defects, but by that point who cares.The plot starts from a simple premise and quickly becomes needlessly confused as developments unfold with near randomness. The film does not have a strong narrative and that is a problem. Characters arrive to move the plot along by offering new monologues, but the plot does not gain any focus with the new characters. The hero and the nemesis theme works well, but the plot seems confused as to who is the real nemesis the Devil or the Angels? Another motif, the voyage, which is common in nearly all films, quickly bogs down into logical inconsistencies or simply into convenient monologue situations.  A film that demonstrates a superior use of the voyage motif is Deliverance.  Then again, Dogma does not have the narrative of Deliverance. The following are a few examples of the poor logic and the monologue enablers. If Alan Rickman's character can magically transport the characters, why have the voyage?  The monologue situation seems forced with the arrival of Rufus and the completely coincidental meeting of the main characters on the train?  The scene adds nothing to the overall plot because it reveals no new information or new motivations for any of the characters. A further logical inconsistencies is that Jay and Silent Bob, mere mortals, beat up two angels, but later are unable? Finally, why would two angels firstly talk to a devil and secondly why would they believe the devil? The devil is considered the master of all lies.On the theological points made in the film, they are not even wrong. Smith is confused about Catholicism.  Such a confusion is probably an indictment of his religious education as much as an indictment of his ability to do theological research. For example, when did the Muses appear in Catholic Doctrine?  Why does Smith seem intent on believing that God can be made to suit Man's image? Smith's material on Catholicism's foibles is simply rehashing familiar themes rather than developing anything interesting.  The jokes are already stale and the theological points he thinks he is making are dubious at best. Even the film's central theological premise is logically and theologically flawed. It can be argued that the film relies on religion in general and Catholicism in particular as a vehicle, but the material and its misinformed use detract from the film. By contrast, the film Seven, which had no theological pretensions, does a much better job using religion as general vehicle.  The Exorcist, which relies upon Catholicism in particular, proves to be superior in how it treats religion as plot vehicle.In the end, Smith appears unable to decide whether he wants to make a drama or a comedy.  It appears he possesses the ability to do comedy, but lacks the necessary script writing talent, the ability to develop a strong narrative, to create a drama.  A pity such acting and writing talent is wasted on a film that confuses irreverence for profundity and theology for drama.

In comparison Dogma is trite, forced, laborious and worst of all unfunny.The problem with Smith is, and this infects all his movies, he thinks his mundane observations on life can sustain not just two or three hours, but a whole catalogue of films.Clerks worked because it was fresh, amateurish, and somewhat fearless. It was the first time audiences were exposed to Smith.And he came out swinging - this is what I think about censorship/porn, jocks, religion, love, the system. It was a movie about rebellion and this resonated with a lot of white 15-year-old males.But you can't make movie after movie on the same premise. Filmmakers are meant to grow (Cohen brothers) and take audiences with them.In this sense those 15-year-olds who followed Smith, and who he owes his career to, have been cheated. His thoughts on Christians (and I'm an atheist) are the same he had 15 years ago. Yet he still has his faithful followers shell out to see them writ large, every couple of years.His growth, or lack of it, as a filmmaker is outpaced by his budgets. When $10,000 (Clerks) suddenly becomes $10 million (Dogma) and yet all you get are the same gags, surely audiences have a right to feel cheated and short-changed.I feel sorry for Smith. I'm sure sitting through one of his films is as frustrating and unpleasant for him as it is for me.Here is a filmmaker who tried to branch out (Jersey Girl) but failed catastrophically. This forced him to revert back to dick jokes and resort to Hollywood mechanisms &#x96; sequels, star cameos &#x96; to sustain a career. The very things he thrashed against in Clerks.He wants to be taken seriously as a filmmaker but at the same time uses gay jokes and bestiality to get a laugh. While this is quite obviously a sign of a director lacking vision or inspiration Smith claims these devices are his way of keeping it real, a kind of 'hey I'm still the same guy I was 20 years ago, success hasn't changed me'. Damn straight.And that's where my real annoyance with Smith comes from. If he just put his hand up and admitted to being lucky because he built a career off one film and now gets paid to do what he loves, I'd be happy.Instead he is a conceited git who tries to pass off his films as something more than uninspired garbage.I see his latest film is about a cop (Bruce Willis) whose baseball card is stolen.

Intelligent people occasionally feel embarrassed enough to explain their emotional attachment to religion in the form of some essay / artwork.Smith's opening strategy towards validating his increasingly unpopular religion (catholicism) is to roll out some traditionally un-catholic behavior to make the pope-lovers that inhabit his church seem hip. For instance, one catholic broad works in an abortion clinic and mourns the blissful ignorance of her early childhood, when she never questioned anything and had total faith.How much easier life would be if one never had to think at all! It would make a great sales pitch for a lobodamist, and should be the tag-line for this film.When he isn't trying to make right-wing squares seem cool (which is impossible to begin with), Smith resorts to the most time-honored tradition of organized religion fear-mongering. Chris Rock, playing the angel 'Rufus', earnestly reminds us that using the term Christian mythology makes God mad. He hates that! Rock exclaims with the widest expression of surprise at the existence of atheists.Indeed? You're not scaring anyone, Smith. Aside from the people who were scared in the first place.

Unfortunately, as a piece of entertainment, it is far too creepy to warrant most viewers' attention. The movie continually oozes a bizarre mish-mash of bloodthirsty divine retribution, inanely anti-intellectual pseudo-theology, and conservative values shrouded in flimsy pretension to open-mindedness. It would seem that the film wishes to revive sincere interest in an unadorned, anti-institutional version of original Christianity. It succeeds only in portraying Christianity as a barbaric, simplistic and primitive appeal to middle American mush. Of course, some may believe this portrayal to be accurate, but that makes it no less disconcerting.

Due to the fact that it treats Catholicism in a very flippant fashion, it was somewhat controversial at the time of its release and was even denounced by the Catholic League as blasphemy. However, it is best to take the film about as seriously as it takes its subject matter. It features numerous criticisms, both explicit and implicit, of Catholicism and organised religion in general and I have to say that I agreed with every one of them. Smith's writing is excellent and his direction is getting better and better with every film. He is much better able to handle the stunts and special effects than he was in Mallrats but wisely keeps the focus on the characters.I don't generally comment on such things in my reviews but, as far my own religious heritage goes, I was raised Catholic but I am now an agnostic. At one point, Bethany Sloane describes feeling inspired as a child when she attended Mass. I have to admit that I never felt that way. I did not question Catholic teaching when I was younger because I was too young to question it but, in retrospect, there was always a sense of going through the motions. The countless revelations of corruption and abuse in the Catholic Church, particularly in my native Ireland, did not exactly endear it to me either. Other than my sister's wedding, I can't remember the last time that I even entered a church.The plot concerns the fallen angels Loki and Bartleby, played very well by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who were expelled from Heaven after getting drunk and objecting to the tenth plague of Egypt. They discover a loophole in Catholic canon law in the form of a plenary indulgence in a soon to be rededicated New Jersey church which would allow them to reenter Heaven but doing so would prove that God is not infallible and consequently lead to the destruction of all Creation, which would be a shame. In order to prevent this from happening, Heaven calls upon the services of the last scion Bethany Sloane and the two prophets, namely - who else? - Jay and Silent Bob. Linda Fiorentinio is wonderful as Bethany. By far the most realistic character in the film, she is a bitter, cynical Catholic abortion clinic worker who is suffering a crisis of faith in large part because her husband left her because she cannot have children. She attends Mass every Sunday but she gets nothing out of it and is not even sure why she goes. However, she is thrown into the deep end when she is visited by the archangel Metratron, the Voice of God. Over the course of the film, she struggles to come to terms with the fact that she was uncertain about God's very existence one day and is on a mission from Him (or Her!) the next. The antics of the borderline sex pest Jay are not of much comfort to her.The fallen angels are very interesting characters. Loki is a fun lovin' former angel of death who enjoys messing with people by convincing them that God does not exist. He also gets a giddy thrill out of getting up to his old tricks and killing sinners. At first, Bartleby is the more staid and sensible of the two as he wants to keep a low profile and not risk God finding out about their plans to return upstairs. However, he experiences an epiphany when he realises that God has infinite patience for His favoured creations, namely humans, but He expelled them from Heaven after one mistake. Although Bartleby has learned that their plan will negate all existence, he still intends to go through with it, which astonishes and disgusts Loki. Affleck is no Laurence Olivier but is very good at playing Bartleby's anger and quest for vengeance.Jay and Silent Bob have larger roles than in any of the previous three films and, as the former, Jason Mewes has most of the funniest lines in the film. It is a shame that Mewes has never had a big career outside of Smith's films as he is incredibly funny. Silent Bob is less verbose than in Chasing Amy but manages to save Bethany's life numerous times throughout the film. Alan Rickman, a far better comedic actor than he is a dramatic actor, is likewise extremely funny as the frequently drunk Metatron, who is bitter that most Christians do not know that he exists since there has never been a film about him. I have never been a big fan of Chris Rock either but he is very good here as Rufus, the thirteenth apostle who was left out of the Bible because he is black. The same is true of Salma Hayek as the muse Serendipity, who works at a strip club and was responsible for inspiring 19 of the top 20 highest grossing films of all time. Sadly for Metatron, none of them were about him. Jason Lee is both very funny and suitably villainous as the horned demon Azrael. George Carlin does not have much screen time but he is absolutely hilarious as the unorthodox Cardinal Glick, who seeks to revamp the Catholic Church's image through his Catholicism Wow! campaign. Oh, and Alanis Morissette plays God. Isn't it ironic, don't ya think? Actually, like the contents of her dreadful song, it isn't. The film also features great small appearances from Bud Cort, Janeane Garofalo, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson (making his first appearance since Clerks) and Dwight Ewell.Overall, this is an excellent film which does not take its subject matter too seriously but manages to say some very interesting things about religion, good and bad, along the way.

Poking fun at religion often ends up drawing the wrong kind of publicity. However, back in 1999, Kevin Smith had enough clout to assemble an impressive cast to bring to life this irreverent comedy/fantasy adventure.The story concerns a couple of fallen angels (Matt Damon & Ben Affleck) who discover a loophole that'll allow them to re-enter Heaven. Little do they know that this comes with the unfortunate side effect of negating existence as we know it. Luckily for us, forces for good (including an angel, a muse and the 13th apostle) have enlisted the aid of some unlikely heroes in a quest to save mankind.The cast of Dogma is more star-studded than most of Kevin Smith's movies. Buddies Damon & Affleck were among Hollywood's top young stars at the time, so getting them involved was something of a coup. However, the story was expansive enough that there was plenty of opportunity for others to shine as well. Linda Fiorentino plays the story's central character while Alan Rickman, Chris Rock & Salma Hayek offer divine assistance. George Carlin also makes a memorable appearance as a cardinal aiming to reinvigorate the Catholic church. Alumni from past Kevin Smith movies include Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Smith himself and, in smaller roles, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson & Ethan Suplee.Smith's script features his usual knack for dialogue and pop culture references but, to me, it seems to be a bit heavy on exposition at times. That being said, having seen the many deleted/extended scenes, it's clear that considerable effort was put into cutting the movie down to a reasonable length. Meanwhile, Smith's direction is consistently well handled and the special effects are decent enough for this relatively low budget production. Musically, there are a few memorable moments but mostly the focus is elsewhere.All in all, Dogma is an interesting and original movie, though perhaps lacking a bit in satiric bite. On the other hand, the light tone is probably for the best since it makes the movie less offensive than it could have been. I don't know if Smith really has much to say in the end but it does make for an entertaining couple of hours.

But Dogma does more than inventing new mythology. It seems to also include an important discussion on issues of gender as it presents images of women that challenge the existing order, and 'men' and 'Women' that actually don't have any sex organs and their gender identity is in doubt. This discussion is not unusual to science- fiction and fantasy movies and TV shows today (especially the works of creators like Joss Whedon), but in my opinion this was quite innovative in the year in which the film was made.The muse and other supernatural beings in the film are portrayed as sexless (except Rufus). The Two angels and God's voice don't have sexual organs. The angel Loki (Damon) even complains about his inability to masturbate and Metatron (the God's voice) says that in heaven the act of sex is considered a joke.The revolutionary aspect of the film is expressed most notably in God character. Throughout the film, a discussion is being held between the characters whether God is male or female when every time he/she are treated differently. God as he / she is represented in the film as a creature that combines the two genders and rises above them so it does not really matter what is the truth and the ongoing discussion in the movie as it is presented by Smith is futile and ridiculous..The film passes the Bechdel test. It presents a number of main women characters who talk among themselves even though for most of the film the main character (who is a woman) speaks primarily with male characters.

It is at times hilarious, smart and dramatic while at other times it is juvenile, misguided and irrational. The fourth movie from Kevin Smith, Dogma, plays out nicely but leaves the viewer slightly empty after watching the film.The plot concerns two angels, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who have been banned from heaven and have found a loop hole that will get them back in. At the same time, a woman, Linda Fiorentino, is charged by God to stop them. The movie races from one scene to the next, leaving no time to breathe. Joke after joke comes flying at the viewer, while at the same time philosophical banter on religion comes just as fast. Like Clerks. and Mallrats, this movie is made up of a whole mesh of scenes that form a cohesive whole. Unlike those movies though, there is a strong story that is told as the movie plays out.Coming after Chasing Amy, an absolutely fantastic low budget romantic comedy, Smith's Dogma just seems to pale in comparison. The movie tells a story but the scenes and dialogue come at you so fast that there is never time to digest what just happened. Just as you are thinking about the last scene, or about the comedic repertoire spouted out by one of the characters, or the commentary on Christianity (or religion in general) that is rather astute in it's logic, Smith throws another of those three motifs at you. You forget about what it was that made you think, or laugh and you move on to the next piece. About 90 percent of the film plays out this way. If Dogma was a straight out comedy, like Clerks., then this wouldn't be a problem, but considering the dramatic theme on religion that is inherent in the script, the movie just doesn't play out as well as it could. Even though the film feels a tad too long at it's just over two hour runtime, the film could of been a wee bit longer to flesh out the ideas that Smith is trying to convey.That aside, the only other complaint I have with Dogma is that at times it comes off as rather tepid. Bodily function jokes and cheap shots at sex and religion are in abundance, and again, in the right context this type of humor works a hell of a lot better. Chasing Amy showed a more mature side of Kevin Smith. It was far more sophisticated than Mallrats and even Clerks.. Dogma tries real hard to reach the same heights as, and even soar past, Chasing Amy and there are fleeting glimpses of it succeeding but ultimately the poop joke overshadows the rest of the film.One last thing before I move to the positives of Dogma. There are many a plot hole in this film. There is one glaring one that cannot be mentioned, in lieu of giving away a major plot point, but one that frustrated me to no end. The rest of them, I think could easily of been avoided if the movie was a few minutes longer.Okay, onto the good things about Dogma.The acting in this film is pretty damn good. All the leads are excellent and even though I usually don't like Chris Rock, he was pretty damn good too. Fiorentino exudes cool and sexy, Alan Rickman is strong as ever and Affleck and Damon are always fun to watch together. But this film belongs to Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). Having made somewhat brief appearances in Smith's previous three films, they return as major characters this time around. The two together are uproarious and are a joy to watch.And Smith's direction of the action is better than anything he has done before. Chasing Amy delivered on a promise he showed in Clerks. and Dogma expands on that delivery. Shooting for the first time in the scope ratio of 2.35, Smith and his crew have made a beautiful looking film. With rich colours, beautiful framed shots and more camera movement than Clerks., Mallrats and Chasing Amy combined, Dogma stands out as the first Kevin Smith film that is more than just a screenplay. Smith has a much bigger budget to play with this time around and he uses it to great effect.And the sound. I can't not mention the sound. Smith's previous films have all sounded flat. They didn't need much in way of sound but still, they were rather flat and tinny with not much in production value. Not Dogma! Nu-uh! Armed with a great score by Howard Shore and a rich and lustful sound effects track, Dogma sounds awesome. It's clear, it's loud, it's enveloping; it's a thing of beauty.Kudos Mr. Smith on your fourth feature film. It's nice to see you blossoming into such a fine director, much better than what you gave the world in Mallrats. Dogma is a good film, it's witty and smart and is fun to watch right from the get go. It's just a shame that it comes off as so inconsequential. A movie that tackles the subjects that Dogma does should leave the viewer thinking long after the credits role. Sadly, after watching Dogma, all one is left with at the end of the day is a hazy memory of a poop joke.Film Rating 79%Breakdown (How Dogma scored 79%)Production Design 8 out of 10 Cinematography 8 out of 10 Re-playability 8 out of 10 Originality 9 out of 10 Costumes 8 out of 10 Directing 8 out of 10 Editing 7 out of 10 Acting 8 out of 10 Music 8 out of 10 Script 7 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com "}{"Title":"Good Work","Date":"21 November 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" I watched this movie with some expectations in the comedy department and I am glad to say that I am satisfied.

Although he's chewing on some very thick meat in this one, a weighty, opinionated take on a touchy subject isn't quite enough to compensate for the sheer volume of quirks and trademarks the writer/director once again puts up on display. Every on-screen character speaks in long, unbroken monologues; basically mouthpieces for Smith himself. Jay and Silent Bob, the inessential links to Smith's earlier films, feel shoehorned into a plot that would've worked just as well (if not better) without them. Punchlines are virtually spelled out along the bottom of the screen, or glaringly in the backgrounds. It's a pity, because the film does have some valid points about the shortcomings of organized religion and the evolution of spirituality - particularly Catholicism - but amidst so much sinewy excess that central message is nearly clouded beyond interpretation. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, still fresh from the success of Good Will Hunting, turn in strong performances as ignorant fallen angels but ultimately find little else to work with. "},{"Title":"By far Kevin Smith's best movie","Date":"6 January 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" People have been waiting for this movie ever since the last line in the credits in Clerks said Jay and Silent Bob will return in Dogma. They returned, but in Mallrats and Chasing Amy, before this movie was made. I guess Kevin Smith wanted a few more films under his belt before he tackled a film like this, considering that it is probably his biggest budget film made to date.At the beginning of the movie, he tells people not to take this film too seriously, including the critics, and that God has a sense of humour so instead of calling it down in flames, just enjoy it. Even though, this comment at the beginning did not stop the Catholic Church from petitioning Disney to not release it, and from the film makers receiving lots of hate mail. Kevin Smith wasn't too worried as he then published the letters on the internet.This movie is mainly about belief and the substance of it. I do disagree with his conclusion that faith is malleable and that it doesn't matter what you believe but as long as you believe then it is okay. Personally, just because I believe with my whole heart that the plane I am going to get into will not fall out of the sky, it doesn't mean that the plane won't fall out of the sky. In the end, this is probably the most heretical thing because it deceives us into thinking that we don't have to submit to God's rule and can save ourselves. Personally, if you wanted to be offensive, you should have gone the whole way and said that Jesus is the only way to God.What it does say, which is probably far more offensive to some traditionalists, is that Jesus had a thirteenth disciple that was black, and that Jesus himself was Black. It also suggests that God is a woman, only to say at the end that God in fact has no sex (which I don't necessarily disagree with). Then we had Allanis Morrisette come out, acting all joyful and giggly. He also said that Mary had other children after Christ, and in fact it is highly unlikely that Joseph would not have hung around if he wasn't getting any sex - which I thought was actually quite a cool argument against the Catholic belief that Mary remained a virgin.The movie itself is about two angels who were kicked out of heaven because one got too drunk and convinced the angel of death to give up his job. They then discovered a loophole to get back into heaven, and unfortunately that means that if they do so then God is fallible and thus entire existence vanishes for existence rests on the fact that God is infallible. The reason that the loophole exists is because the Catholics created all of the traditions which God has to hold (not true, and the biblical reference is taken out of context as well), and thus the angels are using this tradition to get back.Even though I do make some criticisms, Kevin Smith does clearly outline at the beginning that this is a movie and that it has been written for a laugh. Even then Kevin Smith does put a lot of ideas into his movies, and from watching them we can see some of the things that he wishes to say. It was true in Clerks and other such movies, and it is the same here.I guess in the end, this movie is a good movie (in fact it is my favourite Kevin Smith movie), but it falls back on some of the practical aspects. Kevin Smith is a brilliant writer, but his directorial skills are not the best. Some suggest that maybe he should stick with being a writer, or maybe work with some other directors, but whatever the suggestion, the truth is that Kevin Smith is very talented, and we hope that this isn't his last movie.

They also look like the guys from Good Will Hunting! These two angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) were cast from Heaven for things un-Angel-ly, though they believe they have discovered a loophole that will allow them access back to heaven, and they have 4 days to get to New Jersey to exploit it.The problem there is that existence itself is based upon the principle that God is infallible, and proving him wrong in any way disproves that, meaning existence itself won't&#x85; exist.So every man and his Dog(ma) from both sides (you know up above and down below) are intent to either allow these two misguided Angels passage in order to create chaos or prevent them from f*cking up the nice gig we humans have down here.The finer points of the plot don't matter here &#x96; suffice to say that the Church trying to get hipper and more accessible is a factor &#x96; what really drives the film is that the theological backdrop provides Kevin Smith's many characters with a setting where his dialogue sounds more plausible, even with all the unnecessary and extraneous formal touches that no-one aside from he and his characters use in everyday life. But Angels, Demons and Apostles probably do (not sure if I need capitals there but I'd hate to p*ss off the Church!).With the big G-(wo)Man being laid up and unable to step in it is up to his staff to prevent this unholy act.Bethanie (Linda Fiorentino) is the initially unwilling human charged with the ultimate responsibility by the Metatron AKA voice of God (Alan Rickman), Rufus is the formerly unknown 13th Apostle (who proves his authenticity by stating that Jesus still owes me twelve bucks!), and Smith faves Jay and Silent Bob are essentially escorts along for the rise &#x96; and to provide much of the potty humour.On the Red team are Azrael the demon (Jason Lee) and a few teenaged minions.The ludicrous and way out setting is perfect for Kevin Smith to work with, being a pet project he obviously spent a great deal of time coming up with a plot that while far-fetched hangs together and is plausible in an impossible way. The script is often clever, the dialogue better than anything he has written since and there is lots of detail along the way that shows the time spend fine tuning the small things.But with the good comes the not so good &#x96; though Smith thankfully keeps his indulgences minor &#x96; there are still various comic book references, a myriad of 80s references and wink-wink cameos, but it must be said they do all work or at least not detract from the good stuff.And finally what other film can say that they have Salma Hayek as a stripper (I could give you 20 paragraphs on that 90 second scene alone!), a Sh*t-Demon, and who could forget the mass murder of fast food chain senior management topped off with the slaughter of hundreds of New Jersey-ites? (Unfortunately this was made before Jersey Shore so they weren't able to kill off the unbearably untalented Snooki &#x96; that might be a job for a Terminator in the future.) I think Clerks remains Kevin Smith's best film and Chasing Amy is his most accomplished, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the film he was most satisfied with, after all he managed to tick most of the Kevin Smith Bingo TM categories off (potty humour, 80s references, cameos, a cast of his familiars, drug references, Jay and Silent Bob, comic book parables etc) AND deal with his own religious questions at the same time, in a film that works quite well as a straight comedy &#x96; albeit of the dreaded controversial type &#x96; but even without the dick jokes (or lack thereof where Angels are concerned) the script is interesting enough that Dogma would be worth watching.Of course if you are reading this and want me to address the film from a religious perspective &#x96; you're wasting your time. It's just a movie, a good movie dealing with religious themes, but still JUST A MOVIE! Final Rating &#x96; 8 / 10. Smith should go back to writing his own stuff about things that matter to him, anything else could be perceived as a Cop Out, which wouldn't be good. "},{"Title":"I'll Have A ...

The fact is most of us are made to believe in some religion or another, depending on where we live, but this film actually points out that Greek, Norse, Jewish, Indian and Christian religions all have a point, and in this film it makes the observation that all have their pros. Doesn't make any of them right. And knowing that that none of them are right, in truth, it makes a joke of them all. And it does so in such a way it never plays off one religion, it plays them all off against the other. It's actually one of Kevin Smith's best, as instead of just using typical stereotypes to form his characters, he actually developed a character-driven story that involves some genuine history and theology. (as opposed to more recent theological dramas like The Da Vinci Code, which are purely speculative.) OK Jay and Silent Bob turn up to add some chaos. But all in all, this is actually one of Kevins Smiths best. Unless you aren't educated enough to know when the director is testing you. If you don't like this movie, thats actually your failing.

It has some incredibly funny dialog, mostly delivered by Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, and Jason Mewes's characters. As an adventure movie, it has a very creative plot and keeps you hooked throughout its journey to its epic and apocalyptic conclusion.Where the movie fails and fails miserably is at being any sort of actual commentary on religion. Despite the many conversations about religion and dogmas held throughout the film...nothing all that deep is ever really said. The movie ultimately has a shallow message of God is cool. Just have a sense of humor and an open mind. And this is a shame because Kevin Smith is clearly a bright guy who knows a lot about church history; he even claims in the closing credits that the film represents his lifetime's worth of religious reflection. You'd think he'd have said something a little more sophisticated.In fact, despite being somewhat controversial when it came out, the movie never really is all that shocking. Yes, I realize there are religious zealots out there who get offended by even the slightest things (Angels and prophets using curse words! Jesus having a 13th apostle! Jesus being black! God being a woman!). But with all due respect, none of those things are REALLY controversial. I would have liked the movie to have been deeper and delved into greater issues like the possibility of God not existing, or Jesus having been an invented character, or exposing the corruption of the Catholic Church, or what about the role of Judaism and Islam? That would have given the film a lot more weight in my opinion.Fortunately, as I said, the movie is a lot of fun, and so I am able to sit back and laugh at what it offers. Rickman, Lee, and Salma Hayek all give the best performances. I do feel Linda Fiorentino is somewhat underwhelming; despite being the lead character, she frequently seems like the dullest thing in the film. I have heard that she and Smith did not get along, and maybe that affected why there seems to be so little to Bethany.Dogma is a very fun and entertaining movie, but alas, it's not very deep, despite what the director seemed to think of it. Listening to Kevin Smith on the DVD commentary track is almost sad; he talks about how he was disappointed the movie didn't get Oscar nominations. Well, here's why BECAUSE YOUR MOVIE HAS A SCENE WITH A POOP MONSTER! Smith could have made a stronger, deeper film if he had really tried. Instead he just made a little comedy, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's a very good movie to laugh with; it's just not good for much more than that.

I was barely 11 years old, but I'd seen The Matrix, Big Daddy, The Green Mile, American Pie, The Phantom Menace, The Sixth Sense, Cruel Intentions, Toy Story 2, The Mummy, Sleepy Hallow and Austin Powers II, to name a few. But, I unfortunately didn't see Dogma. Maybe it was because I was so young and I didn't get to pick movies to buy or rent. Maybe it was because my parents didn't want to have me watch a controversial religion movie that pokes fun at Catholics and Christians and such. Whatever the reason, I regret not seeing it 12 years ago...Dogma follows the story of Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartelby (Ben Affleck), two angels cast down from Heaven and trying to find a loophole in order to get back in. Chris Rock, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith and Linda Fiorentino are charged with the mission of stopping them, while Jason Lee plays the angel who wants to help them get back to Heaven.I never expected to laugh as much as I did. But a majority of the jokes aimed at religion are quite an interesting take as well as a hilarious one. Kevin Smith is a brilliant writer and one of my all-time favourites. It's simply to understand this because well he knows how to make you laugh. He actually gives some sense of perspective even though he's making fun of some of these religious claims. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I understood that it's a work of fiction...but clearly Kevin did a lot of research beforehand.It doesn't have any miraculous special effects, although the horns on Jason Lee are wicked along with the awesome wings on Ben Affleck. It's great to see Ben be such a bad-ass. I mean, he really hones his acting in this one, and I know there are a lot of Ben haters out there, but he's actually a talented fellow, I think. I especially love the scene where Damon and Affleck are spouting out all the nasty deeds the people in the office of Mooby's have done in their lives. It was such great memorization on their parts and even better delivery and timing. It's wonderful to see them be hilarious, nefarious and downright brilliant all the same time.All that being said, people will never agree on this movie being great or awful for the simple fact of it's subject matter being too controversial and too personal. It hits home with too many people and thus it makes it beyond difficult to judge the movie with an objective view because it's so... sensitive. Perhaps, my bias of liking Smith's films (especially the View Askew universe) I am being generous in my rating. But, so be it, I will be on the minority, I guess, for liking this film. It's not supposed to be a work of insults. It's just a funny fantasy movie and it's just a good film to entertain you for two hours.

The second Clerks installment is an OK film but goes nowhere in almost its entirety and too many of the characters are just annoying. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is utter crap that *probably* had a purpose (despite starring mine and everyone's favorite characters, perhaps proof that they were not meant to be leads). Chasing Amy is a great movie which all the theory-talk and bizarre possibilities inside it makes your head spin. Kevin Smith's films are a coin toss, you never know if it'll be good or bad and it has little to do with how the previous or next movie rates.Dogma is one step up from Chasing Amy and the best of the bunch. With an awesome story, a nicely crafted set of characters, and their respective places in the plot line that come together like fitting puzzle pieces. Dogma is almost ingenious, and yes a movie from the same man that brought us Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. For starters you have a plot with a purpose; this isn't some generic Disney-esquire story of gaining faith with a miracle or some similar crap. You have unforeseen twists and turns. You have characters popping up that all play an important role, and they're all interesting. There's no generic roles either (guardian angel or what have you), as all these characters are a takeoff from what is actually in the bible or have their place in the askew-niverse. The story is insanely cool, you wonder how a person could come up with something this intriguing. There's tons of mainstream actors, and none of them butcher the film like you might expect. The only character/actor I don't like in Dogma is Salma Hayek; she is beyond annoying and they could have at least made her change her accent and tone down that annoying personality for this role. If there's one downfall with this movie, it's her.Otherwise, there's hilarity, there's ideas that make you think, there's oddity yet sensibility, there'a focus on religion that can even keep an atheist like myself interested, there's Jay and Silent Bob, and above all there's a plot that keeps your eyes open and an ending just as perfect as the whole rest of the movie.If you aren't too sure where you stand with Kevin Smith films, or was disappointed with Clerks II or J&SBST, or are just looking for a good movie that will keep your mind awake and engaged and entertained, Dogma is a must-see.

This movie gave him over 300,000 pieces of hate mail and at least two death threats. Without a doubt his most tender movie and his longest, Dogma is a masterpiece. Its religious satire based film touches on many terms in the Catholic religion and becomes a Fantasy Comedy. Not only is it his longest and most controversial, it's definitely his most confusing. Not being Catholic, I didn't know half the topics they touched so I had to do about an hour of research to finally make sense of this movie. Im not big on religion and feel it's just a way to start and argument just like if you are Republican or Democrat. Who cares what you are? If I was with a friend and we finally touched base on our religion and that killed it because he was Jewish and I was Catholic, Id be pretty angry. Religion causes arguments. Arguments Im not in the mood for. Be whatever you want to be and be it with proud is what I say.Now excuse me for not being a genius in the Religion field, but Im sure that I will make a fatal flaw in this review. Tempted to copy and paste part of the plot from Wikipedia in here, I thought about just giving it a whirl and trying to explain the plot. If any errors are made, just post a comment saying what they are. Ill try my best to explain this, but keep in mind, Im not even old enough to vote so Im trying to explain the rules and laws of Catholics.Two fallen angels named Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) are banished from Heaven and exiled to Wisconsin for the rest of eternity. They notice a church in Red Bank, NJ is having it's centennial anniversary with a plenary indulgence. If they pass through the doors of the church, their sins will be forgiven and sent back to Heaven. But it will overrule God and all existence has we know it will crumble. Meanwhile Metatron (Alan Rickman) acts as The Voice of God and tells Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino), whom works at an abortion clinic to stop Bartleby and Loki from entering the church. She must find the two profits, who happen to be stoners Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and the director Kevin Smith) and the thirteenth apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock) who was left out of the Bible because he was black. They also find the Muse character Serendipity (Salma Hayek) whom has writer's block. All the characters assist Bethany trying to stop Bartleby and Loki. Thats not all. The demon Azrael (Jason Lee) and three hockey playing thugs (The Stygian Triplets) are trying to stop Bethany and her friends. Its all a matter of sacrifice to stop two angels from ruining existence.Dogma is probably the most serious Kevin Smith film ever made. Its extremely well written and the dialogue (which Im obsessed with in every movie of his) is like real people talking in a real situation. It doesn't even feel that they handed them a script. Its like they know the lines they are going to say by heart and the movie doesn't even need a script. There's no fear in any actors, they're all natural and seem to know exactly what to say and not say it like they are eye candy for the camera. Which is the beauty of Kevin Smith movies. Movies with raw dialogue, extremely developed characters, and a brilliant, cutting edge story behind them. Which is what I love best.Still remaining locked and not budging is my favorite movie and has been for the last five years, Clerks. Clerks was the first movie in Smith's career and has probably the best dialogue in the history of film and some of the most well developed and the best characters you can relate your life too, I've ever seen. Not to say other KS movies aren't equally impressive. His second movie Mallrats was panned by everyone, but I have always loved it for it's humor and awarded it four stars, Chasing Amy being very well written and deserving of four as well, this too, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was the first movie of KS I gave lower than four stars, but just a smudge being rated a three stars by me because at that point I deemed KS at becoming too Hollywood, than came Clerks II which I deemed very well done and a worthy sequel with a happily three and a half stars to go with it as well.One I didn't mentioned, but reviewed was Vulgar, a dark Comedy mixed with elements of Suspense and revenge was produced by KS, but not directed. I consider it still a KS movie which I thought had great music and a very unique feeling. I awarded it three stars and very favorable review.Dogma didn't seem like my kind of movie, but it was still as beautiful as Clerks and Chasing Amy. Much more plot driven and dialogue heavy than Chasing Amy, Dogma took on a much more deeper story that you had to pay attention to each and every second or you would be lost. Cameo appearances by Clerks actors Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson deem successful in my book as well as George Carlin's appearance being hilarious and well worth it, I rate Dogma the third best movie in the KS series, first one being Clerks, second Chasing Amy, and fourth being Mallrats.Starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Linda Fiorentino, Alan Rickman, and Jason Lee.

I was totally unaware of this film's existence back when it was released in late 1999 (I didn't see anything from Smith until 2005) and the Catholic protests it caused during its theatrical run, but I had learned about this by the time I finally saw it. Since I had previously seen Smith's first three films and they had all made me laugh, I expected Dogma to do the same, and it did.Bartleby and Loki are two angels who have been banished from heaven and sent to Wisconsin, but they find a way they can get back in. A Catholic church in Red Bank, New Jersey is celebrating its Jubilee. If the two exiled angels pass through the archway of this church, their sins will be forgiven, and they will be able to get back into heaven once they die. However, if they do this, they will overrule the word of God and end all existence! Metatron, a messenger from God, summons an abortion clinic worker named Bethany Sloane to stop Bartleby and Loki from getting through the archway, but at first, he is not clear on why she has been chosen for this mission. On Bethany's trip to New Jersey, she is accompanied by two silly prophets, Jay and Silent Bob, and the three of them are soon joined by Rufus, the thirteenth apostle, who is not mentioned in the Bible. Meanwhile, the demon Azrael is working against these four, determined to make sure the exiled angels DO make it to the church and put an end to existence! The beginning here doesn't look very promising, with the Stygian Triplets assaulting an elderly man with hockey sticks, but after that, it soon gets pretty funny, with the conversation between Loki and a nun, the conversation between Loki and Bartleby that follows, etc. At this point, the film is still not as funny as it's going to get. It starts to get REALLY funny when Alan Rickman makes his first appearance as Metatron, in Bethany's bedroom. Rickman is excellent here, playing a comically irritable character! After that, Kevin Smith's two recurring characters, Jay and Silent Bob, help keep the humour consistent for a long time, Jay with his sex-crazed tendencies (constantly wanting to have sex with Bethany and getting on her nerves), and Silent Bob (played by Smith himself) with some of his body language. Chris Rock plays Rufus, and he also contributes to the laughter. The cast is generally impressive. I didn't care much for some of the jokes, including Rufus telling Bethany something he knows about her past, but they are way more good gags than lame ones. This includes what Rufus says right after that, about Jay and his masturbation! Eventually, the humour dies down, but the plot still drives the film after this and keeps viewers watching.This fourth feature film from Kevin Smith has a lot you can usually expect from the filmmaker, including a lot of juvenile toilet humour, swearing, and not much sex, but lots of explicit sex TALK. However, Dogma is also a work of religious satire, and this has inevitably offended many people, who would consider the movie blasphemous. The film can be and has been interpreted in many different ways. However, the fact that it made me laugh so much has nothing to do with my religious views. The same goes for Monty Python's Life of Brian, a popular comedy film which was released twenty years before this one and caused the same kind of controversy. Both films have made me laugh because I've found them so funny (duh). Smith's style of humour is obviously hated by many, and I'm sure a lot of these people think that anyone who likes it mustn't have any taste, but for his fans who can take the irreverence of this fourth flick of his, I think it's worth watching. I don't know what to say about the messages of the film, and exactly what they are, but because of the humour and plot, I have to give it a high rating.

Kevin Smith puts his well-practised slackerisms to good use in picking apart some of the tedious pieties of Catholicism in a modern world. I feel he rather loses this satirical bite about two-thirds of the way through as he looks for a satisfying conclusion to the comedy thriller that has grown out of it (which he does capably).The satire works because it lifts the simplest elements of biblical mythology and simply applies them to modern characters. There are next to no special effects, only wry dialogue and some entertaining acting. In fact, this film has one of the most fascinatingly awful fight sequences of any film I've ever come across (in the train) - a sequence that's almost designed to be half-arsed to make a point.Linda Fiorentino is game as the lapsed Catholic who gets co-opted to save the world by Alan Rickman's 'voice of God'. The Damon/Affleck double act are super as rather smug fallen angels - Chris Rock is typically weak in an acting role (as an apostle. You're getting the idea). Smith himself appears in his now familiar guise as Silent Bob next to the fast-n-foul-mouthed Jay (Jason Mewes), the only endlessly, ingenuously entertaining character. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Hugely controversial fantasy that is as dark as it is funny","Date":"12 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Catholic Bethany (Fiorentino) is sent on a mission to stop two angels getting through a church in New Jersey that will destroy reality.Of all the controversial issues to portray in cinema, it is more than likely that religion in any form of beliefs will be one that raises many eyebrows. Over the last decade there has been uproar from the widely acclaimed The Passion of Christ to the mystery adventure Indiana Jones and the last crusade, all depicting the tales of Jesus. But when a comic concept is thrust inside such a delicate topic, it blows the other films out of proportion, as this 1999 heavily debated picture does.Whatever your beliefs, should you turn on Dogma and be offended by the opening statements about the Platypus, you will continue watching as the sheer concept of this film cannot be ignored. The depiction of tales from the Bible, heavenly creatures and perhaps the most controversial, the race and sexuality of God is all conveyed in a humorous manner. And it is a complete black comedy, the slickness writing by Kevin Smith ensures of that. With the baffling physical humour and complete ease at which the jokes flow makes the controversy of Indy look like an afternoon school session.In an attempt to be light-hearted towards its encoded ideologies, the opening statements suggest the viewer doesn't take the film seriously, which is simply way over your head. There is no question this is a funny film, it is simply tongue in cheek consistently from start to finish but with such a debatable core centre about stopping angels and the concept of religion it has such a passionate core that you will enjoy whilst almost being educated in light heartedness, though the tales told are questionable.With such a hard written script and such an ease in which it depicts the tale of Christianity, it is almost easy to forget this has some of the finest actors in the world.Affleck and Damon team up once again to make a funny pairing of Angels that goes from bad to worse to down right shocking. Fiorentino is as cold as usual where Rickman spices up his sarcasm in the messenger role. Chris Rock brings some dark controversial humour to his role likewise. Jason Mews and Kevin Smith also make a funny pairing who would later go on to make a sequel to this, which for me, is a must avoid. This is simply too unique to be ruined by sequels or spin offs.Dogma is widely controversial but unforgiving with its dark and outrageous humour that will have you laughing and debating for a long time afterwards.

But what really makes this a great film is that it is genuinely thought provoking.There are religious people out there who will criticize this film as being anti religion, anti Catholicism, when it is anything but (well, a little anti Cathlic maybe). The central theme to the film is that there is a God, but not the God that most people know (or think they know) or believe in. The characters in the film are trying to get the message across that people have changed the original God, man has made God into the image they want him/her to be, made their own religious rules, rules that God never intended.

My grandfather, who was a well-esteemed minister in the Congregational Church for 40+ years, loved it, and agnostic kids like myself enjoy the hell out of it too.

Dogma is a comedy but it has a lot of interesting things to say that aren't necessarily humorous. Most of the characters handle their dramatic moments pretty good, yet not forgetting the comedic nature of the film.Linda Fiorentino, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek are also well-written characters that compliment well as the good guys against the two angels.

Which is why using a religious theme is such a slick device everyone /knows/ the context, and the author gets a very wide stage in which all manner of weirdness is allowed to take place (dead people rising; guys with wings; supremely unpleasant villains, etc.) So I didn't have any problem with the religious context of 'Dogma', despite my being a militant, bible-burning, fundamentalist atheist (snarl, gnash). It set up the back-story neatly, allowing the audience to concentrate on the novel elements - sweary angels, black Jesus and all. The result was a very enjoyable and funny film.My problem was with the fact that this was also a very devout film, from an author who obviously believes deeply in god, and whose occasional criticisms of Catholicism were entirely the viewpoint of someone who thinks the formal Church has strayed from the path of True Righteousness. It's his opinion that God could just as easily be a short, cute girly who does hand-stands for fun.On the face of it this is a harmless enough notion, but in reality it's a pretty dangerous one, and ironically little different from the 'Buddy Jesus' concept out with the forbidding, hairy, OT thunderer; in with the more sympathetic character, be it grinning muscleman or playful chicky. It's quite possible that this piece of rank goalpost-moving would have the effect desired by Cardinal Glick - drawing in new converts who would find the cuddlier deity more attractive. Even to an atheist, this is pretty tacky, and a helluva way to run a system promising ultimate truth.In sum nice film; shame about the morality.

Alan Rickman's performance as the Metatron is most excellent; ironic, dark, and dryly witty. Matt Damon rocks as Loki, and even Ben Affleck contributes a decent characterization. In my opinion, Dogma doesn't deserve the low rating it's received here at IMDb, but that rating does reflect the opinions of a Christian-dominated society. I'm frankly a bit surprised it rates two tenths of a point higher in the US than it does in other countries.

You only have to read the reviews here to see with how much venom people hate this movie, because of their religious viewpoint, hate being an important word in religion. Look past the controversy, as i'm sure most users here do and Dogma, aside from being very funny, is quite life-affirming (A phrase i don't like using because i don't feel that i need a film or song to make me feel happy about my life), and will make you think twice about your faith, or lack of it. Watching Alanis Morisette as God, smiling, taking pleasure in doing a handstand against a tree was, for me, suspiciously moving.But if you just want fart and sex jokes delivered in a fast, witty way then Kevin Smith is your director, and Dogma is your movie. um. There is a Demon made of sh*t, Salma Hayek stripping for dollars, decapitations, and the usual capering from Jay and Bob, along with some classic dialogue. Most of the cast have small parts (yup), but they all do well, as do the main characters. i'm not a fan of Affleck or Damon, but when they are with Smith, they do okay.

That said, I'm going to enjoy any film that involves him, Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, and Ben Affleck. However, this film went farther than say, Mallrats. I'm an atheist, but I know Judeo-Christian theology, and it was used to hilarious effect in this movie. However, I'm not going to go as far as some and say this is the be-all and end-all of cinema.This movie was funnier in its concept than its actual script. The casting alone makes you laugh Chris Rock as an apostle? Those two fresh-faced, gorgeous boys from Good Will Hunting as renegade angels? Alanis as God!? And contrary to what some have said, Jay and Silent Bob just add to the film. Granted, their brand of humor takes a little getting used to...people who think Jay swears too much are missing the point.The acting was well done. Affleck and Damon, as we all know, have great chemistry, as do Jay and Silent Bob- of course. The hockey kids, minions of Jason Lee's superb daemon Azrael, were perfectly creepy, and Chris Rock did his usual outstanding job. Linda Fiorentino fit the role well, but was unfortunately overshadowed by the more exuberant characters. The one true standout was Rickman, who was the voice of reason in the film as Metatron, the stabilizing influence, the central point. Simply incredible.There obviously were some flaws. George Carlin was under-utilized, and Salma Hayek, who I usually love, was pretty bland. And it was also completely misrepresented-- this film in no way goes against Christianity, the divinity of Jesus Christ, but merely organized religion. Again, I'm an atheist, so that didn't appeal to me as much, but Ben Affleck's passionate speeches almost won me over.This is a fascinating film, if not the best ever, definitely worth watching, especially for those familiar with the history of the Catholic church-- sale of indulgences, the Catholic Counter-reformation, and also the fun parts of Christian myth- seraphim, Lucifer's battle, and the like. Another great flick from our favorite Jersey boy, Kevin Smith.

Even though there are disclaimers at the beginning, I still reckon that Catholics will enjoy this as much as the atheiests - perhaps even more, considering the so many references to different aspects of the Christian religion.Basically this is a story not unlike but not all that similar to films along the `Prophecy' line, regarding two angels played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon who, after being banished from heaven, discover a `loop hole' that will allow them to re-enter their paradise - the only problem is, if they succeed in their plans, they'll unmake all that their maker has made - if that makes sense.The ideas in this film, apart from seeming like far out conspiracy theories, actually make a tad of sense.  For example, why in the Bible does it not mention Jesus' life from ages 12 to 30?  Could it be that Jesus had to mature and deal with the fact that he was God's only son, or was it a cover up for the family or Mary who possibly had more children, to make her appear more pure?With the usual cast to be expected from Kevin Smith, plus some (well one) pretty surprising extra - this film is even more enjoyable than his previous films, including Clerks, Mall Rats and Chasing Amy.Jay and Silent Bob were outstanding as usual - the only problem I found with the pair, was not knowing which to focus on - on the big screen. A small amount of the dialogue was a little fast for my ears, but the entire amount that I did hear was thoroughly enjoyable, humourous and witty.More of the story?  Ok. There's this woman, who's been nominated to, for reasons cleverly explained in the movie, stop the two outlaw angels from reaching their holy destination.  Along her journey, which begins with her meeting Allan Rickman's character, `the voice of God' and two prophets (Jay and Silent Bob), she accidentally it seems forms a posse, composing also of Chris Rock as the 13th apostle and Salma Hayek, playing the muse.Together with the angels, the mortals, the whole deal, they make their pilgrimage or crusade a most humourous expedition, with a few surprises at the end.  You'll never guess what face `God' picks to show up in.unless someone has already told you.

In a movie climate where most everything is based on rehashed stories and standard archetypes, this film challenges at least religious conviction. For that, it's worth seeing.However in a film that defies convention in some ways it certainly didn't rise above the smut.  While it can be amusing to hear a little swearing in the face of religion, this film goes overboard.  I can accept Silent Bob as a character but Jay added nothing at all to this film.  In fact he (along with his character's lines) could easily be considered the worst part about it.If you can ignore the worthless attempts to satisfy the teenagers who get thrilled by hearing the F word, Linda Fiorentino and Alan Rickman deliver outstanding performances.For a film that has such a daring theosophical message, I would like to have seen a lot more philosophy.  Why hint at it on nothing more than a sophomoric level?  Really make some people think!  If you're going to rattle them, why not explore new thoughts more deeply?  If you're going to be so bold with a message, why not argue that message more convincingly?  While it was certainly a relief to see a movie with SOME depth, it should have had more.All in all, I would recommend seeing it for the 'nerve' it shows, but I would not recommend seeing it for the overall quality of the film.  It had some moments and some interesting thoughts but the screentime given to moronic behaviour, drugs, rampant swearing and constant, overbearing attempts at gore (e.g. a monster made of excrement) ruined it for me.

He takes some nasty shots at the orthodox methods and belief structure of Catholicism in this cranked-up bit about two renegade angels trying to get back into heaven after disobeying their Creator and being cast down into the hell of all hells Wisconsin.   Smith has the tendency to be preachy and overwrought in detail of his thoughts and opinions when writing a script, and this movie allows him the perfect opportunity to sound off from all sides through his diverse and zany cast of characters.  Everyone is their own religious theorist that has the tiresome tendency to progress simple dialogue into long-winded sermons stuffed chock-full of theological banter.  It is easier to take this time around since he has splashed his nonconforming and adroit sense of humor about the place, lightening a situation when it becomes too thought-provoking or dense for some.His amusing supposition of God is that the Divine One is an avid skeeball player and, once in a while, converts his Almighty aura to human flesh so he can drop in at the local arcade to play a few rounds.  But evil forces are about, and three dirty little adolescents called the Stygian triplets beat the Almighty's frail body to the ground with their hockey sticks of death, capturing the deity and holding him against his will as a threat to the stability of Heaven and Earth collectively.  Skip to an airport somewhere in hell, er, Wisconsin where Bartleby (Affleck) and Loki (Damon), the above-mentioned renegades, begin their plotting to get back into paradise. The process of how and why is explained as Bartleby convinces Loki to get involved and they begin their trek across the US to reach a small church in New Jersey, the place where the existing backdoor lies in wait for their entry.Little do they know, an ancestor of the Almighty has just been chosen to prevent their reentry and her name is Bethany Sloane, a simple citizen of Earth who works at, of all places, an abortion clinic.  If the criticism of the medieval and unruly ethics of Catholicism wasn't enough, Smith has the balls to include the hostile, rampant war between pro and anti-abortionists. She is visited in the night by the Holy host Metatron, the substituted voice of God and messenger to her quest.  This is when the movie gets good. Smith couldn't have done better when he cast Alan Rickman as the sardonic seraphim.  His raw delivery but gentle presence is a pleasure above all the casting choices he has made in the past, good and bad. Rickman alone is worth the watch with his rapier wit and polished experience.Granted, Ben and Matt are the perfect pair, seeing as how they're childhood friends, personal acquaintances of the director and have already shown what they're capable of in their Oscar-winning film `Good Will Hunting'.  The only problem I have with them is that when they're working together in this movie, it's like watching `Good Will Hunting' again, only with a livelier story line and a deeper moral.  They seem to be playing themselves more than they're playing Bartleby and Loki.  This `He's my best buddy and I want to include him in every movie I'm starring in' crap is getting a little old. Of course, with an Oscar sitting on their mantle, they won't need to find each other jobs for quite a while.Chris Rock was a hilarious original as Rufus, the 13th apostle of God purposely unaccounted for in the bible because of his race.  He drops the usual mottled routine he heralds on-stage, substituting a subtler charm and snappier humor.  George Carlin is perfect as the sanctimonious highflyer Cardinal Glick, a vicar who doggedly campaigns the modernized and worship-friendly changes to Catholicism.  His transition into Glick's ambitious persona is done with the greatest ease, proving once again that he is a wonder to behold on a movie set as well as in front of a live audience. Carlin's skilled comedic prowess makes donning the priestly robes the ultimate irony and he delivers the holy haughtiness of Glick's character with dexterity and precision.Who I really thought was an interesting choice on Smith's part is Linda Fiorentino as the Last Scion.  Judging by her failures in movies such as the forgettable 80's fop `Gotcha!' and the cheap sex thriller `Jade' (not to mention acting alongside David Caruso), Linda is taking a step up from martyrdom as Bethany, the bitter child of God who cures her lost faith by saving the world from total damnation.  There are other actresses who had their foot in the door for this part, but Linda seems to have that special, sexy charm that can't be compared.Smith has done well so far, picking himself up when he's fallen down, but not without words.  How can we expect any less of our belligerent and quarrelsome screenwriter?  His mouth has gotten him many places, and may his working mind continue to keep him decent in his writing.

By no means do I loath this movie, but It wouldn't make it onto my 'best ever list'One of the reasons I like it is because it does actually raise some excellent points. For example, Jesus WASN'T white. This is a fact (I mean come on, he is jewish born in Jerusulam, we made him western). He wasn't black either but the point the Rufus made is correct, it seems only a white person can be the worlds saviour.Another thing that I found interesting was the fact that Joseph and Mary had more children and that there are direct descendants of them.Now for the movie on it's own merit. The script, as ever, very talkative, quick and witty, more f***s than is necessary and I found myself actually switching off from what was being said due to the boredom of hearing it 1001 times.  That said, the script is excellent.the direction, never Smiths strongpoint, actually I heard him say on a TV show that he asked Robert Rodriguez to direct the day before they started shooting because he couldn't handle it, is not good, the second half does get boring but not so boring you want to switch off. It should have been quicker and tighter.The cast is briiliant!!  I like Damon and Affleck (especially Affleck, ruled in Chasing amy) Lee is just genius and Rickman is pure class (I'm English, call me biased P) The female stars aren't the best, Fiorintino is OK, Hayek, obviously smart, Very beautiful but Cannot handle Smiths fast talking dialogue. Maybe if the movie was in Spanish....In short, watch this movie with an open mind, religion is irrelevant, it's not meant to be blasphemous or anything like that, just a look at religion.

Then the Catholic church in New Jersey initiate a plan to get more people back in church. Anyone who comes to the church on a given day will be granted general pardon for their sins. The two aim to be pardonned too, in order to go to heaven when they will have changed to their human forms afterwards and made sure they die. Problem is that by so doing, they'll prove God's infallability wrong which will lead to extinction of creation in total. So God sends for a rescue mission, His Voice (HER) descends to earth, finds a girl who later proves to be related to christ, and instructs her to prevent the two from entering the church. Two prophets will help her, and along the way the 13th Apostle and Serendipity (hayek) join them. Bla di bla and so forth. The two get help from Lazarus and his evil knievels who is pissed off with God and rather ceases to be than go back to hell. So in the end, a big shoot'm all up, God is found just in time, she pads Bartleby on tha back, screams him to death and saves all.

It did actually raise some pretty valid points, and certainly highlighted the ignorance and incognizance that is typical of theology. And besides, was Life of Brian made to disregard and disrespect The Bible etc? No, it was made to be funny, just like Dogma was. And they both succeeded.I have yet to see any other Kevin Smith films, but after seeing Jay and Silent Bob in Dogma, I won't hesitate to catch any of his other work. Jay's overuse of the profane was hilarious, it didn't shock me or make we want to cry and whine about it. As for Silent Bob, he was cool despite the fact he only said three words in the entire movie (not quite Silent there though eh?).I was quite confused by Bartleby's startling mood changes, first he was merciful, then passive, then homicidal, and finally remorseful.By far, the best scene in Dogma is in the Mooby Company boardroom, when the vengeful Bartleby and (especially) Loki make the entire board (minus one) pay for their sins, and pay they did.In closing, everyone in this film, apart from Linda Fiorentino (too pathetic, whimpery, and self-seeking), deliver a good performance, and thus, make it a must-see movie, that is of course if you are not too up yourself beforehand.

We wonder why society is so obsessed with violence, but almost every movie compels us want to see the good guys exact a horrible and bloody revenge on the bad guys.  Is it any wonder that people with a warped sense of justice seek to exact their own violent and lethal revenge, instead of learning to deal with the fact that we're not always going to get things our way?  How many more mass murderers see themselves as 'hero' and because someone taunted or teased them at school, think it's okay to go out and kill them, and anyone else who happens to be there?  Hollywood makes it ok for 'good guys' to kill whoever they see as 'bad guy' every time.. not just bring him to justice.  The hero is always allowed to be judge, jury and executioner.

The cast choices made sense about 50% of the time.  The dialogue between characters was excellent.  But I think the characters should only have to say the same line once.  Never more than twice.Affleck and Damon were obvious choices for their roles.  Linda Fiorentino is always a favorite.  I think Salma Hayek's role could have been left out.

When I first heard Kevin Smith was doing a religious film and about the subsequent outrage this had provoked from the Church and the usual quarters, my heart leapt. I am a big Kevin Smith fan - from Clerks, his superb debut, the unfairly maligned Mallrats through to the enjoyable Chasing Amy, his work has been a constant boon to US independent cinema in recent years. Now was his chance to echo the comedic success on a religious theme of The Life of Brian and to repeat the controversy of Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ.Dogma is certainly full of amusing and witty ideas. What did Jesus do during the mysterious 'middle years' between twelve and thirty, upon which the Bible is silent? Why not have a priest proposing a new logo - a Jesus giving a thumbs-up sign - to replace the 'depressing' crucifix symbol? The Bible belt's predictable cries of blasphemy are unsurprisingly ill founded to. Dogma is overly deferential to Smith's Catholic Church if anything.I want to see the film reminiscent of Chesterton and high satire on religion which some have alluded to. But the film I saw was a disastrous mess. The antics of Jay and Silent Bob (surely time to give these two a rest?) and Damon and Affleck's angels didn't mesh at all with the otherwise epic themes on show. Somehow I managed to ignore the film's numerous flaws for the most part until quite near the end. Alan Rickman's performance was terrible - I would say he was wholly unsuited to comedy had he not been so brilliant since in Galaxy Quest. He sounded like an American attempting an English accent (something of a feat as he is English). Then there was the general feeling that Smith was trying to make two ultimately irreconcilable movies - religious satire and Mallrats-style caper at once. But at some point - probably when the camera was lingering on bullets being fired into Affleck's angel wings - the horrible truth became unavoidable. Kevin Smith has made his first bad movie. And this is surely the greatest sin of all.

Jay and Silent Bob.  Salma Hayek before she opens her mouth.  Mooby, epecially the boardroom scene.Now the negatives everything else.  Yes, even Alan Rickman, who seems bizarrely to be *faking* an English accent.

I really wish she could, because she's smart gorgeous, and un-Hollywood, but she simply can't carry a line.  Perhaps she'd be better on stage.And yes, Dogma is over verbose.  By that I mean that the same ideas are repeated over and over, sometimes even in the same shot.  I felt as though I was been bludgeoned around the head, and most of the ideas weren't even that interesting or original.The directing is also (sorry Kevin!) very shoddy.  Many scenes consist of actors repeating the same gestures during an extended speech, or restraining each other to pad an action scene (hint to Kevin, you can't have two people hold each other back).  You can get away with improvisation in character scenes, but it really ruins action shots.The thing that really bugs me is Kevin's repeated use of Deus ex machina to advance the plot.  I can't decide if he couldn't think of better devices, if he genuinely thought all the ex machinas were funny, or if he's making a point; the hospital scene is, after all, quite literally Deus ex machina.I wish Dogma were a better film, because I really wanted to like it.

Also, most of the swearing was out of place too, I'm no prude by any means, but I felt the script could have done without two thirds of the f word.

The social commentary is dead-on, and the comedy is, at points, so incisive that it may leave teeth marks.  And yes, the entire team working on the film shows such wonderful talent.But...   (Possible SPOILERS ahead)The violence in this film make it unwatchable to me.  Yes, both physical and verbal violence.  You can say that the underlying message is this or that all day long and you still have murderous angels taking out their frustrations on people and Jay and Silent Bob objectifying women.  You still have the unbelievably disgusting humor.  What's wrong with this?  Two ways to look at itFirst of all, from a humanistic standpoint, we are all in the same boat at the movies  allowing ourselves to become engrossed in a fantasy is wonderful, but also very influential.  No, it's not going to make Timmy go kill anyone, but it does cheapen the value of virtue while desensitizing us to that which is vulgar and violent.  Why do some people abuse?  Partially, because of their first education.  Exposure to and trauma by abuse not only makes it a valid course in the minds of abusers, it does so below the conscious level.  So I think we're all affected by what we experience (that includes the movies).Second, from a Christian standpoint, whatever glorifies good glorifies God.  Whatever glorifies what is not good is evil.  This movie may glorify goodness (read  faith, God perhaps), but it also glorifies what is evil.  If you must see this movie, remember that what is on the surface is also important.

But someone sends them an article and they discover a loophole in Catholic Dogma which would allow them back into heaven. Unfortunately existence balances only on one principal, God is infallible. And if Bartleby and Loki would get back into heaven, it would prove God is fallible. And then existence would become nothing. So it's up to Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) to `Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all existence'. But she won't have to do it alone. She gets help from two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), who don't really get their job yet. From a muse, Serendipity (Salma Hayek, who's got to earth to get credit for her ideas but suffers from a writer's block. From the thirteenth apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock), who isn't in the bible because he's black and of course claims Jesus is black. And from an angel, Metatron (Alan Rickman), who's sick and tired from doing the same thing over and over again.All this makes a very funny story, with a lot of bible jokes. The movie also makes fun of things like McDonalds and other movies (even Star Wars).The cast is great! Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are very good as the two bitter angels. They don't seem to mind to kill a couple of people, after all Loki is the angel of death. I didn't really like Bethany, but Linda Fiorentino plays her role very well. Jay and Silent Bob are two characters who are also in two other movies by Kevin Smith. I haven't seen the two other movies, but they were very funny. All their scenes are worth watching. Salma Hayek is a great muse, or actually a bar dancer. She's the very upset about everyone thinking God is a man. And that's only because all the writers of the bible were men, so She became He. Rufus is a nice guy, but a death guy. He isn't very happy with the fact he isn't in the bible because he's black, so he helps Bethany to become a more famous apostle. Alan Rickman is absolutely adorable as Metatron. He's pretty pissed that no one knows him. Every time he has to give someone a message from God, he has to explain who he is. This is a very funny scene in the movie, when he comes to tell Bethany what she has to do. Although this is a movie about angels and religion, it doesn't keep the characters from swearing. (Especially Jay) Metatron's first words after his fiery entrance are Sweet Jesus! This movie is definitely worth watching, except for some people. If you don't like swearing or violence, skip this one. And if you take your religion very serious, also skip it. If not, go watch it.

(I noticed Martin Scorsese was given thanks at the end of the picture, wouldn't that combo of writer and director have been interesting...?)   Also, his dialogue here served as exposition far too often.  That's why I say it would have worked better in another medium.  'Dogma The Book' anyone?

Smith did assemble a great cast, and come up with one or two hilarious moments (The 'Buddy Christ' was just classic...!)  Although not particularly religious myself, I believe that Smith is a Catholic, so I'm sure he had no wish to be mean-spirited about any kind of faith.  If you see the movie and find it offensive, fair enough, but what I can't understand is those Bishops criticising the film when they haven't seen it.

The script is bogged down by the constant lengthy explanations of various aspects of Catholicism and biblical history  -- Smith really was in a bind here, as he needed the explanations to play out his plot, but they only serve to remove the necessary flow to the story.Nevertheless, the provocative ideas and the fact that at one level Smith is taking religion seriously, gives the movie some value.  However, this creates the other trap the movie falls into, which is that it's jokey tone (which at times, is hilarious) makes the relative seriousness of the final act seem totally out-of-place.  Again, this may have been an insurmountable challenge for any director/writer.Seeing this movie reminded me of a comment by Andy Partridge of the band XTC.  He had attempted to prevent the release of Dear God, one of XTC's most successful songs, a very questioning take on religion.  Partridge explained that he thought he had failed to encapsulate his feelings on the subject, noting that he could have written a 3-disc box set on the subject, and still only scratched the surface.

I liked Dogma, but it is not my favorite movie of his.First off, this movie goes a little overboard on the preaching.  This movie seems less like a comedy and more like religious theology.  Kevin Smith, the writer/director/producer of this film, has spent almost ten years writing this movie.  If you look at the end of his first movie, Clerks, it says, Jay and Silent Bob will return in Dogma. There were two movies in-between Clerks and Dogma, Mallrats and Chasing Amy.  So it's pretty obvious Smith put his heart and soul into this movie.  But had he made room for more comedy and less talk of how the humans `got it all wrong' in the Bible, I believe the movie could have been much, much better.Another problem is some of the jokes are pretty pointless.  Example The S**t Monster.  That's what it is, a monster that rises out of a toilet made of, you guessed it, excrement.  Not only does it have nothing to do with the plot; it's not even funny.  Another bad point is that Salma Heyak, one of the hottest women I've ever seen, can't act very well.Okay, enough bad stuff, on to the good.  Anything involving Loki and Bartleby is comic genius.  Loki says one of my favorite quotes of all time Are you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire. Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance. Mass genocide is the most exhausting activity one can engage in, next to soccer.  These two guys are hilarious.Next, Chris Rock is good, but he can't act very well.

As a non-Catholic, I am the one who should be offended, not the Catholic League, but I am not offended simply because the film deepest truth seems to be that you just have to have faith in order to have a good life. That truth rang bells and got me reinforced confidence in God and His(or Her)power.  The acting is great, with the duo of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in two very interesting roles.  Jason Lee is a bit scary but effective as Azarel. Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, and Selma Hayek give strong supporting roles as some form of Heavenly creatures.

The in-built chaos and repetition of themes represent real life and history, threads so messy and inexplicable that they force you to seek faith in a higher power.  Well, maybe not force you, but give you an idea.  And as the film points out, abstract ideas are much more positive and fruitful than unshakable beliefs. An idea is unbound; a belief is constraint.Dogma is not easily praised or criticized.  Smith often goes for the cheap joke (his s**t demon is the worst) and obvious statement (or what should be obvious), but he has a rare gift for insightful dialogue and supportive direction.  His characters are as verbose as in any Tarantino movie, but they spout divine parables along with the one-eyed winking juvenile obsessions.  What makes Smith a great artist is that he manages to keep both extremes in balance, equally funny and moving.  He's also lucky enough to be blessed with incredibly talented actors.  Everyone in Dogma is first rate, although Smith blunders in his handling of the picketing anti-abortion crowd.  They're presented in a campy moronic style reminiscent of the anti-porn protesters in John Waters' Polyester.  What worked with Waters (another Catholic, by the way) seems out of place and needlessly cruel in this movie.  Smith makes his point of how religious zealotry can lead to obsessive and destructive behavior much more eloquently through Rufus, the 13th apostle written out of the Bible because he's black. Smith obviously has his satirical knife sharpened, he just needs a little more restraint on how to use it.Those looking for another all-out Smith comedy like Clerks or Mallrats will be disappointed.  Even though Jay and Silent Bob are ostensibly the major heroes, their stoner antics take a backseat to Bethany's rediscovery of faith.  (If you want a plot description, look elsewhere.)  For all the bullsh-- protests, Dogma stands out as one of the few movies in recent times to reaffirm the existence of God.  Its blasphemy lies in our God-given right to make choices and interpret what we've been told.  The movie presents a fictional Armageddon ordained by the Pope, so Catholics had to blindly get up and protest.  That behavior suggests that the ism in Catholicism is akin to alcoholism.And by saying that, as a Catholic myself, I'm destined for hell.  Or at the very least, to be told I'm going to hell.In the meantime, check out Pasolini's The Gospel According To St. Matthew.

Great it wasn't, but very good is an excellent status for Dogma.Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are fallen angels, utterly bored with their Earthly existence. Receiving an anonymous tip-off, they discover that there's a loophole in a church dogma that will allow them to re-enter heaven. Even if it does mean that as a consequence, all human existence will be destroyed. Trying to head them off at the pass are Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), an abortionist who's lost her faith; Rufus (Chris Rock), the black 13th apostle, and pervy prophets Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). During their journey, they are helped and hindered by camp herald angel Alan Rickman, muse-turned stripper Salma Hayek and a demonic henchman. Oh, and Alanis Morissette is God.The film starts out excellently, but somewhere along the way, Dogma loses it style and attitude and becomes a little silly. But, there's still largely enjoyable performances from one of the best casts in a long time, awesome directing effort and lots of funny in-jokes to keep the energy equipped.I highly recommend Dogma, providing that you don't take it too seriously.I rate Dogma 7 out of 10.

What got on my nerves was Linda F. for one.  I had to turn the television up to nine just to hear what she was saying half the time and second, I expected more special effects.  I mean come on, if your going to do a movie about God and have her/him actually show up in the movie and do something fantastic, well come one use that budget for the special effects for God.  I mean, with all of  these movies about the devil and demons, the special effects of the devil or demons are out of this world.  The only movie I have seen that has me cheering for the All mighty, is the Ten Commandments.  There are some beautiful examples of God getting some good special effects done in movies - in this movies.  Why is it that the devil is always the hero in the most of these movies.  I would like to see a block buster movie about God or Jesus Christ coming done from the mountain and beating the hell out Satan, you know what I mean. This movie just didn't give me a punch I was looking for.  The only special effect that God did in this movie was open her/his mouth.  That's it. Yawwwwwwwwwmmmmmmmmmmm.

This is definitely a movie to be seen more than once, because you can't possibly absorb it all in one viewing. As stated in earlier reviews, the references to Catholic catechism and parochial upbringing abound. I'm sure that Kevin Smith was taught by nuns and clergy, because he's constantly poking fun at things that I experienced in Catholic school. The actors are all having fun in this movie, even if they have no idea what it's all about. Jay and Silent Bob have real parts in Dogma, as opposed to Chasing Amy where they appear to be talking extras.  By the way I never saw Dogma in the theater, but it works as a video because some of the funny lines go by so fast you have to replay the tape to get the full meaning.

I am not a believer, and I have an enormously wide margin for what I think is funny - basically, there is NOTHING one can't make fun of. It's just timing, respect and decency that limit comedy. And this film is right in every aspect. It has perfect timing religion in any form is always blown out of proportion at the turn of a century, it respects God, for he truly is just and loving in this film. It is also decent, despite the harsh language and one special monster defeated with mouth spray - it is decent because it makes fun of religious people in a harmless way - I wonder how close to reality that buddy-Jesus came - no doubt experimenting with making the catholic church more popular has been done. Religion is the winner at the end, and God is still good and gracious.

Hilarious interpretations for God's gender and his alleged death give Dogma that rare smell of innovation that so many big studio movies these days lack.Sadly though, Dogma suffers from the worse case of multiple personality you'll ever see in a movie. The movie is characterized in radical mood swings and atmosphere changes. One moment it's a smart and hilarious movie and the next moment it turns to something so sticky and religious that no 'Sunday's school' would have been ashamed of. While watching, and enjoying if I may say, Dogma, you always have that disturbing feeling that a religious consultant of some sort was present on the movie's set at all time, working overtime trying to balance every 'sacrilegious' scene with a matching 'God fearing' scene.One of the highlights of Dogma is its ability to present fundamental theological concepts, as God and 'Faith', from a unique perspective, so different from the 'Religious' perspective and paradoxically at the same time loyal to the meaning of the 'original text'.Humanizing God and his servants would have been considered sacrilegious in most major religions, even though in the Bible it is clearly said that man was made in ..the image of God.. (Genesis 1,27). The original verse in Hebrew is even more clear and leaves no doubt that the makers of Dogma understood The book of Genesis and the 'miracle of creation' better than most religious Dogmas in the past Millennium or so.Dogma goes out against every modern religious approach which makes the belief more important than the believer. This important saying in Dogma along side with its mockery for the Calvinist ideas (religious mortification and orthodoxy) which are becoming popular again in America, lead to the conclusion that among the makers of Dogma were no doubt some 'normal' religious/non-atheist people whose goal was to deliver the following message through the movie Lighten up people, not even God takes himself that seriously.Dogma's strongest side is its cast. From the rightfully known Ben Afleck and Matt Damon to the hilarious Metatron and stoned 'prophets', Dogma forms a praiseworthy cast. This cast manage to salvage even the most 'religious' scenes from total disaster and give them some meaning, through excellent acting.A note also must be said about Alanis Morissette's part as God. The role of the all mighty himself combined with literally no line to be said makes Alanis's part the best part possible for a non-actor person, and she performs it well. As one viewer put it in reply for another viewer's amazement of the lack of words in Allanis's part She's God! what else can you ask for?!Overall Dogma is a smart and funny comedy worth watching despite all its obvious flaws. It's safe to say that Dogma is an important movie and even a 'landmark' in its own way.

A comedy, but not only that a comedy that is a tag stupid. Not as stupid as Hot Shots though but still it is not intelligent and it is far away from normal. This however does not say that the film is bad, for odd films do seem to have an attraction sometimes. This one is not different. Ok this is not Mallrats, but it sure beats the hell out of Chasing Amy.The story of this one seems very easy, two angels who were cast out from Heaven find a way back in and must be stopped, or the world will end. But this is not the bottom line of the movie, for it is so much deeper than that. There is a lot of mocking and satire going on here, but also a kind of admiration for faith. It is a mixture of what most young people nowadays think I guess and that is that believe is good, but sometimes organisations like the Catholic church overdo it. They are too hypocrite and stuff. So rather believe your own belief. Some might find this insulting, but hey, all I can say is The FIRST amendment and hell, it's TRUE, so stop nagging.The actors well there is a lot to say of them, but here comes the short version. You all know  at least a couple of these actors I presume and know they are good, but it just might happen, that like me you think at the beginning that they suck. Fear not my friend, it is merely the effort you have to make to get into the movie and the story that makes you think that. Later you will say the actors were good.

Let's make an ENTIRE MOVIE out of Jay and Silent Bob is a stupid idea; and, for a fact, we see too much of those two.  But the kind of fantasy Smith has spun out of Catholic dogma, and Catholica generally, is nice.  A writer on this site says it reminds him of Chesterton.  Ye-es, kind of, I can more or less see that, although Chesterton would never have dared to write so much as a sentence that might be interpreted by anyone as being critical of the Catholic Church; by the end of his life he was probably incapable of even forming such a thought.  Smith mixes reverence with revisionism in much the same way that writers of latter-day Sherlock Holmes pastiches do.  This is Without a Clue, except that it's based on Catholica, rather than the Holmes stories.  Is it, then, a good movie?  No.  Is it, at least, a good script, ruined by Smith's flat-footed direction?  No.Chasing Amy might with justice have been named Talking Almost Incessantly About Amy, but even so I had no problem with the writing.  Too much talk?  Yeah, perhaps, but at least it felt unforced - men and women really do deliver speeches to one another of that sort -; and the speeches weren't badly written, apart from the fact that they tended to go on for too long.  But it looks as if word got around to Smith that Chasing Amy was too talky.  So he took one look at his even talkier Dogma script, and said I know - I'll break the monologue up into dialogue; and the result is MUCH more stilted, with characters, poor Linda Fiorentino's in particular, reduced to the status of foils with lines like, Yes, Socrates, It cannot be otherwise, Socrates, and, if they're lucky, How so, Socrates?  This by no means exhausts what's wrong with the script.  Humour is too thinly spread and not quite right - wan, somehow - when it appears.  Even Smith's vivid passion for popular art has been bleached away to a pale stain.  And I can't avoid having the impression - not that THIS exhausts what's wrong with the script, either - that Smith was too timid with the religious institutions he's ostensibly criticising.  If even THIS mild rebuke to the Catholic Church, buried under layers of pro-Christian propaganda, is enough to incite mass protests and virulent hatred ... you have to wonder, just what religious-inspired art WOULD bishops find acceptable?  The Father Brown stories?  Going My Way?  Anything else?This reminds me there's a scene in which Loki kills the board of the directors of the Mooby Corporation (Disney, thinly disguised).  (Boy, was THAT joke laboured.)  I guess I'd better come to the defence of Disney here, if no-one else will the scene was offensive.  The implication was that nine-tenths of Disney's management consists of sex offenders of one kind or another who deserve to die; but secular organisations, and secular beliefs, are fair game - and so, I suppose, they should be, but I wish that the Catholic Church realised it has no more right to be shielded from criticism, or offensive comment, than Disney does.It's all a pity, because although I'm not in love with Salma Hayek, she's gorgeous, and I'd like to be.  But someone has placed a curse on her.  Perhaps one day it will be broken, and she'll appear in a good movie.P.S.  Since I've mentioned Without a Clue I should also mention that it's a comic gem.

And stand-up is really what the film is Smith's unorthodox observations and reflections stitched to a comic book plot and characters.  The story itself is a series of complications and delays allowing Smith to break up the talking head sessions with a smidge more movement.

Our alienated angels see it as their made-in-Heaven loophole, the only way for them to defy God's express will and rejoin their exalted choirs.The skeptical Scion, played by Linda Fiorentino, gets a visitation from God's mouthpiece, the slithy-but-loyal Metatron (Alan Rickman). Get thee to New Jersey, says he. Head the angels off. If they pass through that arch, God will be shown up as fallible. All of existence will go poof.Along the way to testing this half-believed hypothesis and, with any luck, rescuing God, our Scion meets the 13th Apostle, exiled from the Bible for being black--as, supposedly, was Christ himself; a pair of unlikely prophets (one who can't stop talking about, er, forking her and one who never speaks) whose witless mission it is to abet hers; and the Golgothan, the toilet-overflowing monster who is the sum total of all the bowel evacuations of all who were crucified on the same hill as Christ.The whole ensemble is potty-mouthed, in fact--except Metatron, too enervated and effete to use four-letter words, the prophet Silent Bob (Kevin Smith, the film's writer-director), and, of course, God Herself, whose voice may not be heard by human ears lest they be detonated beyond eternity.The real reason God cannot speak, if this movie is taken literally, is that She could not do so without self-contradiction. She might have to reveal why Her omnipotence could not get Her out of that hospital bed, why She gave Her Church on Earth enough loophole rope, absolution-wise, to hang existence itself, why angels, who unlike humans have no free will, could even so defy Her, or why her divine chilling-out regimen includes Skeeball and handstands.The movie is wickedly funny, and puerile beyond belief. If no rational propositions made about God could be true, it suggests, no lascivious propositions made to complete strangers could be sinful. Keep the faith real do every funky thing.

The performances are all poor - although it's hard to act when you've got a billion words to say.  Speaking as a Brit, Alan Rickman's performance reminds me a lot of an old Kenny Everett punk character who I think was called Sid Snot.

Clerks seems to be some kind of watershed for slacker/DYI comedy when it's simply a movie about New Jersey kids with some funny dialogue - and there's nothing wrong with that.Dogma struck me as the first *film* Smith has yet made. There's something to it that doesn't exist in Clerks, Mallrats or Chasing Amy. It doesn't need Jason Lee and Jay & Silent Bob to carry it like in previous Smith movies. This film definitely takes advantage of the great cast of celebrities & personalities, but there is *something* driving it all - an interesting storyline and a subject that intrigues people (and I'm not even referring to the more sensational/controversial Catholic baiting either).Dogma isn't **4 stars great,** but it's kind of cool because now I can maybe see Smith as more than a simple yet creative Jersey guy who really digs comics and stuff.

At times, Smith appeared to be beating the Catholics over the head with the same message.  While I'm no fan of dogma or organized religions, I thought a more subtle approach would have been more entertaining and more effective.  There were times where you could just about see Kevin lecturing (preaching) through the dialog of the actors.  It was OK for a Pay-per-view evening, but I wouldn't put any more effort into watching the movie than that.  Kevin Smith is a real talent.  However, I think his youth worked against him here.

Of the three films preceeding this one my favourite was 'Mallrats', however Mallrats' place on the throne as king of the 'view askewniverse' was anything but secure. I was planning to see 'Dogma' on boxing day, but having been struck with Christmas fever I decided not to join my friends and fellow Kev lovers. That night my friend phoned me to nicely inform me how stupid I had been and how fantastic 'Dogma' was. I was bitterly disappointed and decided to see it the very next day. My friend held it in such high regard he joined me regardless of only seeing it less than 24 hours previous. To my joy I found he was absolutely right. 'Dogma' was an absolute joy to watch. It was the true ruler of the 'view askewniverse', but puns aside this became my favourite of all Kevin's movies. It has so much going for it. Kevin is such a funny man, true most of the jokes in this film include a lot of 'naughty words' but what most people do not realise is THEY ARE STILL VERY VERY VERY FUNNY.If you have ever seen one of his films, you will know how rib splittingly, gut bustingly funny Jay and Silent Bob, the New Jersey stoners are. I can honestly say, they are at their absolute best in this their fourth movie. Jay has never been so funny, you may say this is down to Kev's script and this may be partially true but Jason Mewes has never acted so well, looked so funny and deserves a lot of credit. The best part of watching this film for a second time, is concentrating on Silent Bob even when the focus is supposed to be on somebody else because he is always doing something funny, pulling a face as somebody says something with strong sexual content or doing something with arms, you guarantee he will be doing something. This is different to his other performances, not to say they were not funny, they were very funny, but this is a fresh alternative. Watching this will help highlight how much of a comic talent this man really is.Other highlights of this piece were Ben Affleck, someone I have always been a fan of especially in 'Chasing Amy', who was excellent in this film, he really is a fabulous actor in my opinion. I was also surprised by Matt Damon, a man I have never liked but one who was very sharp in this, after seeing this I was eager to see more of Mr Damon's work and he certainly is impressive. But the master stroke was making the leg quiveringly exquisite Salma Hayek a muse turn exotic dancer, a part she showed a talent for in Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Til Dawn'. Certainly a key scene in this film is her opener. I find it hard to take my eyes off her during this film and she also plays a very entertaining role.Full marks to Mr Smith, he has done it again. He may not have a huge following but he certainly warrants one. This was his most successful cinema outing and deserves to be. People criticise it for it's unholy content, but it has to be said, this is pathetic. It is closer to anti-freeze than anti-christ, and those who protested against it wanted nothing more than a little publicity. Kevin Smith himself is in fact a catholic, as well as this, he is a true comedy god, whoops false idol sorry, I meant he is a real comedy genius.

It would be a thinking catalyst. For people who never cared the movie would be boring. For big-brained true believers who know for sure that god is male, Jesus was white (jewish, whatever) and the exact number of apostles was twelve it would be outrageous. Decide what fits you.As to technicalities, the movie is not as perfect as it is perceived by some. Yes, talky script by master Kevin Smith is quite good, there are some truly hilarious one-liners. Yes, overall filming quality is good. Special effects, although cheesy, are well done given the film budget. But the acting is bad at times. Although Linda Fiorentino delivers solid performance, but Ben Affleck sometimes overdoes it and looks fake .If you read some comments about this film you'd see a bunch of smart people rushing to tell you that Jesus was not black, or that angels cannot become humans when angels' wings are cut off, or that there was no thirteenth apostle, contrary to what is stated in this movie.This is not a documentary movie, so we cannot expect from it to follow exactly canonic christian texts, can we? It interprets many issues loosely which makes it quite thought provoking. Did Jesus have brother and sisters? Is working in an abortion clinic a crime against God? is God almighty and omnipotent in the sense we impart in these words?Obviously, some big-brained Catholics (or Christians) did not realize that the movie was a comedy and became its targets. Just as funny as a professor trying to prove he's a smart guy to a court jester who called him an idiot. Who on earth can prove that God is not a woman or that Jesus was not black?This movie teaches one to look at things, the bible included, critically. Not to say the bible said so but think critically and creatively about faith. It gives an inspiration to keep it, but to distinguish true faith from religious dogma.

Smith has brilliantly juxtaposed deep religious discourse with sophomoric cheap laughs.I've read other comments here, and I must say that many people seem to be missing the point. Smith did not reduce his theological treatise to a sequence of crude jokes. This would not explain the fact that for every time Jay hits on Fiorentino's character, there is a scene of straight, unashamed,  unadulterated, serious theological dialog. If it were really worthless drivel, then why would it feature a Catholic who works at an abortion clinic and is dealing with a crumbling faith? That's not easy material. To trash this movie for Smith's keeping with his style is to throw away a true attempt to bring theology to the masses. He has managed to ask truly difficult questions and pry into deep territory, and at once make it accessible to the average sitcom-raised American without dumbing it down.And if you're Catholic, that's all the more reason to see this movie written by Catholics for Catholics. (You just have to learn to laugh at yourself; that's always a very healthy thing anyway.)(And, as Smith himself says, DON'T take it too seriously. Alanis Morisette is there as a good old, unexpected cameo appearance; Chris Rock is there because he's hilarious; Jay and Bob are there because that's Smith's schtick and people relate to them.

One, Kevin Smith hates the rest of us, though he probably doesn't know it; and two, Alanis Morrisette can't act to save her life.  This last not being Alanis's fault (and she does sparkle a bit), but Smith compounds the problem by saddling her with a tiny but profoundly pivotal role even the most talented actress would have trouble pulling off.Dogma is at once hilarious, weighty, and obscene.  Hilarious, because it would take an Al Gore to botch its comic premise two fallen seraphim (Affleck and Damon) can return to Heaven from Wisconsin exile only by way of  Red Bank, N.J. (my birthplace,  incidentally); said re-entry and its disastrous consequence preventable solely by a Catholic abortion-clinic worker of holy pedigree (a gorgeous Linda Fiorentino), a couple of wayward, trash-talking potheads--well, one of them talks--and the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock, and he's a hoot).  Weighty, because hey, we're talking about the Apocalypse, and a benevolent, very real and very Catholic God.  How often does Hollywood do *that?*And it is obscene.  Kevin Smith reduces this otherwise grand parable to a trivialized, foul-mouthed vaudeville act, a theological Porky's.  This is the hate shining through. Everyone, even the angels, from Metatron (Alan Rickman) on down is blasphemous, cynical of the Almighty's competence and working mightily to either cover the Lord's tail or make a canonical end-run around Her infallibility.  (Yes, God is a woman, and she looks like Alanis Morrisette.)  Hasn't Kevin Smith heard that most Americans still believe in God, a belief that, by definition, even among the unchurched, places God as diametrical from the imperfect, the scatological and the sexual as He is from Satan?I'm sure he has. Smith just didn't care, a negligence born out of a contempt for his audience *and*  for God.  Why else have a dimunitive no-talent like Morrisette play the Supreme Being? (Believe me, Morrisette is utterly clueless.) God, who never volunteers star turns, deserves a convincing stand-in.  He, or She, does not get one.

The third (and ironically critically acclaimed) in the Jersey Trilogy tried to mix the writer's knack for inventive, funny, ultra-real and often vulgar dialogue with a deathly serious (anti)romance agenda. This and the lack of Jay & Silent Bob made it a bit of a damp squib for me - leave the angsty dramas to other directors and TV movies Kev, stick to what you're good at!I therefore expected that by drifting in the opposite direction - that of a blockbuster - Kevin Smith might rectify his previous mistakes. Unfortunately Dogma hits just as far off the mark as Chasing Amy, only in the opposite direction. It seems to be an uneasy balancing act between serious satire and sci-fi fantasy, muting a lot of the humour.I don't agree that only Catholics will get Dogma. Anyone with a vague knowledge of religion can see the jibes and reasoning going on here. And this is one of the strong points. It doesn't mock Catholicism, but it DOES mock the hypocricies and illogical reasoning of dogmatic belief - things people take so literally or fearfully that they lose sight of their faith. It also mocks those who try to make too light of religion.This satire works reasonably well with the verbal/gross-out comedy of Jay & Silent Bob but unfortunately, the blend of these elements just DOESN'T WORK when combined with fantasy elements of devils and angels and sh*t demons... The whole idea of Jay & Bob et al is that they live in a very normal world (cf Clerks) and the fantasy elements don't seem to gel in a Smith film.One final thing I'd say is that most of the Catholic criticism of the film is utterly unsubstantiated. It is plainly obvious that many of the dissenting voices have never even seen a draft of the script and are merely going on word of mouth. I am not saying that these people are lying, or of poor judgement but they should not condemn a film if they have quite obviously not seen it (quoting quite bizarre plot elements that have nothing to do with the film, taking all casting judgements and thematic elements to be grossly insulting without seeing them in context and complaining blindly just because they hear that the film has something to do with religion).

Alanis Morrisette is so cute as God, too (although I'm certainly no fan of her music).  I was also very impressed with a toned-down Chris Rock as Rufus, the 13th Apostle.

The cast includes Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino (Men in Black) Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman (Die Hard), George Carlin, Alanis Morissette, Jeanene Garofalo (The Truth About Cats and Dogs), and of course, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as the always-present, incomparable duo of Jay and Silent Bob.The plot is this Two angels, banished from Heaven, find a loophole that will allow them to get back into Heaven. By getting back into Heaven, they will prove that God is not infallible, consequently bringing about the end of existence.Despite the somewhat heavy and serious subject matter, this is  a comedy (as the disclaimer states, even God has a sense of humor). Be warned, don't see this movie just for Alanis Morissette. Despite the fact she plays God, she gets about 5 minutes of screen time and speaks even less then Silent Bob! See this movie because it is a truly funny comedy film that doesn't take itself seriously, thanks in large part to the prophets (Jay and Silent Bob) and the 13th Apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock). The subject matter and negative reviews deterred me from seeing this movie in theaters, but I am so glad I saw it on video. This film is far better than the other Kevin Smith film I've seen, Clerks.

As complete movies, they're uneven, and that trend continues with Dogma.  There are some very funny scenes and dialogue (Jay & Silent Bob are always good for a few gags), but this comedy is a thinly veiled diatribe against organized religion, which isn't particularly original or enlightening.  The plot is basically just another chase movie, with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as outcast angels bent on returning to Heaven, even if it means the end of all creation, while Linda Fiorentino and crew must stop them.  Smith often bogs down the action with random rants against organized religion, but he really seems to be saying is, All you organized religions have it wrong, God just wants you to be a good person.  Of course, that organized religion is usually an attempt to define what is good is ignored.  Anyway, as philosophy this belongs in someone's file cabinet of Religion 101 essays.

The film itself raises some thought provoking idea's and from the standpoint of someone who was raised in the Catholic doctrine, some very valid one's.  There is no point going into them here as this is not a theological debate forum.  But I will say that if you want to criticise the film, see it first.  Sticking strictly to Dogma is a pitfall that the movie highlights very well.The questions of ethnicity, belief, God's Gender etc. are also tackled very well.  And the film itself I feel is downright funny.There may be a problem with the pacing, but I feel that is because the movie was shortened from 3hours plus.  Hopefully the DVD edition will rectify this and the overall vision that Kevin Smith had can be realised.I also felt that some of the points in the movie, touched on similar ideas to the Prophecy series and that in turn was based on the Lucifer/Sandman graphic novels by Neil Gaiman.Overall, the movie is about individuals, existence and the meaning of life. Whether or not these are answered, who cares? Just enjoy the ride.

Sure, some have remarked on the sloppy direction, but Smith self-admittedly is a better writer than director, and I thought things went fine.  The plot is fresh, the dialogue fresh (if more than a bit profane) and the characters are wacky as all get out.  Plus, it's pretty funny. I thought the Film Geek's review was dead-on when he said this was the best religious satire since Monty Python's Life of Brian, as the films have quite a bit in common.  Both take religion seriously enough that they're stable enough to joke about its foibles-and I appreciate that.  Good satire has its basis in truth, and desires to bring about change, and Dogma definitely accomplishes this.  I especially appreciate how earnestly it deals with the difficulty people have with relating to God.  Why do his plans so little coincide with our own?  Does knowing things are 'in his plan' make hardship any better?  And Metatron's exposition on having to tell Jesus what was in store for him is profound, and thought-provoking.  It's strange that all this works, along with a demon made out of excrement working into there somewhere...Many reviewers have said that the Catholic League is insane for boycotting this movie, as you will rarely find a greater proclamation of faith in film.  I'd have to agree.  The only reason you might want to boycott this is if your faith is so small that you cannot question what you believe for fear it might disappear, or if you're prudish enough to dismiss it on the language and themes-which are admittedly juvenile in parts, but understandable.  Dogma's not perfect-but it is very good, and I do recommend it.

I think all Catholics should see it because it is a thought-provoking comedy about Christian faith.  The Catholic Church doesn't want its members to see the movie because they believe it is blasphemous, but it's not.  It points out the hypocrisy of the church with humor- it does nothing to denounce the Catholic faith.I thought Chris Rock did a great job portraying the thirteenth apostle.  I normally find him annoying, but I loved him in this movie.  I think he was the one that said that people don't feel spiritual when they go to church.  They only feel bored.  There is so much truth to that.  Many people, including me, find church a sleeper.  Some people make lame attempts to be more holy by sitting up in front during masses and donating big money.  But the question is, are they really more holy or are they just putting on a phony act?  The way I see it, faith comes from your heart.  It doesn't matter how much money you donate, or even if you donate at all.  Less important is where you sit during mass.  A person sitting in back might feel ten times more spirtitual than someone sitting up front.Sorry if I sound preachy.  I'm not a very good Catholic, so its almost hypocritical for me to be talking about faith.  I'll get back to the movie now.I really liked the fact that God was a women.  Alanis Morissette did a great job.  It's not a new concept, though.  The band Dishwalla calls God Her in Counting Blue Cars.Another thing I liked was the human portrayal of the apostles and the angels.  Most movies show holy people and angels in a white gown, surrounded by glowing white light, with perfect personalities.  But that was not the case in Dogma.  The angels and the apostles wore street clothes.  They even threw around the f-word a couple hundred times.Anyway, if you've never seen this movie, see it.  It doesn't matter if you're a good Catholic or not.  It won't offend you if you're not Catholic, but you might not understand it.

I'm sure this is partly due in no small part with a star power draw like Ben A. and Matt D.  But I got the feeling this is pointed towards the MiddleoftheroadAmericanCatholic. (Yes, this writer is a card-carrying member of this club...)In the movie, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a Catholic abortion clinic worker (just the kind of person who becomes most in touch with God) who is going thru a crisis of faith is visited in the night by a seraphim (Alan Rickman) who informs her that she is to stop two fallen angels from entering a church or otherwise cease existence as we know it.  The two fallen angels, Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), are responsible for the early biblical wrath of God events, and have fallen out of favor (banished to Wisconsin), and are looking for a way back in.  When a Cardinal introduces a Catholicism Wow! campaign complete with Buddy Christ icon, they hear about a loophole-Plenary Indulgence-in which anyone who goes into this church is forgiven of their sins.  Their ticket back to heaven.  Along the way, Bethany gets help from Rufus (Chris Rock), the unknown 13th apostle, heavenly muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek), and Jay and Silent Bob (natch) in a much more expanded role in the movie.  Round out this movie universe with demon Azrael (Jason Lee), who has his own agenda against Lucifer, and his lackeys who are helping clear the path for Loki and Bartleby, and even a cameo by God.People of a decidedly non-Catholic persuasion may have a harder time appreciating the finer points of the dialog and passing it off as boring biblical background, and the violence and gore may definitely turn off people who had no idea of what they were getting into when they walked in the theatre/rented the movie. (The poop demon probably could've been left out, but it was sort of a turning point in the plot) I could also see the more fundamentalist types finding the thought provoking concepts proffered in the film to be downright offensive.  On the surface the film may skewer some of the inconsistencies of Catholicism but the core idea of faith in God (or insert Supreme Being here) is ultimately underscored.  Anyone not willing to open their mind a little need not apply.Having heard the original cut clocking in at close to 3 hours some of the slower spots may have been able to explain themselves out a little better, but given the amount of territory covered, the script was mighty meaty with what still remained.  This script did make sense to this reviewerwithaCatholicbackground...I honestly can't find much fault with anybody's roles in this, and yes, Salma held her own, but definitely no Oscar nominations from this role. Alan Rickman has his Cynical Brit role down to a science, but still thoroughly enjoyable.  To find out Jay and Silent Bob had a major role in this film (you must see the other Smith films to appreciate this duo) pleased me to no end.  Chris Rock as Rufus was great, and Linda Fiorentino played a character that showed a real humanity for someone on a mission from God-you have to wonder if all the Saints went thru such deep upheaval. And of final noteworthiness, it was a very interesting plot twist when the fallen angels take a role reversal of sorts-the fury switching from Loki to Bartleby was simply inspired.  Yes. Ben and Matt did well with their roles...A very captivating movie more likely appreciated by those of us who had Catholicism as an intrinsic part of our childhood and who have grown to a larger perspective.  More of a mixed bag for others...

The only way to get back is to get through the Arch of a church in New Jersey during a centenary ceremnoy. That way, not only they get back to heaven, but they also prove that there is a loophole in the laws of heaven. And God Almightly certainly doesn't want THAT to happen.  It would be sure to ruin existance as we know it. More worrying is the fact that Azarel himself has decided to help the two anti-heros in their quest for gaining heaven back. So God sends a hoarde of people to save the day and the world as we know it today. The Sign (Bethany, who works at an abortion clinic), The 13th Apostle (Rufus), the Prophets (Jay and Silent Bob) and Metarton (the Serafin), who is also known as the Voice of God. And of course the proverbial Muse who tires to help as best as she can.Dogma is not a movie to be taken seriously. If it was, it would be of great offence not only to the catholics, but to all believers in general. Instead, it has to be taken lightly, for what it is, at times with a pinch of salt. The movie's greatest strength does not lie in the storyline - in fact, the second part of the movie is as close to absurd as one can possibly get. The script in itself though is incredibly funny, and the film does present us with some surprisingly weird yet incredibly good situations. In particular, I liked Kevin Smith's Silent Bob and of course the hilarious 13th Appostle (played by Chris Rock) who not only claims that he was left out of the Bible on purpose, but also makes some shocking revelations about Christ, the Holy Mary and God Almightly.One cannot fail to mention Alanis Morisette's five minute apparition.  Her interpretation of 'God' literally steals the show in the last part of the movie.In spite of my initial misgivings about the topic and the rather, unfortunately, absurd ending, I found Dogma a highly enjoyable movie, deserving a good 8/10 for originality and for giving me one of the best laughs in months.

The entire finger-cuff line in Chasing Amy and to some extent the characterizations of women in Dogma (Salma Hayek as stripper) are examples of what I am speaking.Additionally, I generally think Kevin is a good writer, but to allow him to write, direct, and star in his own productions is TOO MUCH!  There are no checks and balances that normally exist in film making.  As a result, we see the poo monster, we see horribly over-directed acting, we see the ego-stroking Silent Bob (is anyone else tired of Bob and Jay?), and a general absence of direction.Finally, what's the deal with Kev and directors like Quentin Tarantino who feel compelled to drench the audience in vulgarity.

It is the story of two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) that have been cast out of heaven and banished to live in Wisconsin.  With the help of their friend, the devil Azrael (Jason Lee), they discover a loophole that allows them plenary absolution during a ceremony at a Church in New Jersey.  If they enter this church, they will be forgiven and be able to get back into heaven.  The trouble is that if they do this, God will be proven fallible and existence will come to an end.  So Metatron (Alan Rickman) recruits Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) who is the last scion of Christ to help stop them from entering the church.  The rest of the story is basically an action adventure/comedy sendup culminating in a confrontation on the church steps.Kevin Smith's story starts out razor sharp, with biting intellectual humor that mocks some of the basic tenets of religious belief, while simultaneously broaching some pretty deep philosophical questions.  Unfortunately, as the film progresses, the edge is lost and it degenerates into a slapstick action flick with occasional returns to the religious allusions.  Overall, it was very entertaining, but the story could have been so much more if it stayed on point with wry intellectual forays, rather than degenerating into farce.The cast was delightful.  Matt Damon gets a chance to play a little less serious role and brings an enchanting comic naivete to Loki, the former angel of death and vengeance.  Affleck is the most intellectual and serious of the characters, and it is his ability to stay sincerely serious in absurd situations that makes him so funny.  Linda Fiorentino was terrific as the Catholic girl who had lost her faith.  She had a wonderful ability to broach disturbing thoughts that almost all of us have about God and religion, while maintaining a sense of mocking self doubt and comical despair. Chris Rock plays the spiritual guide; the unheralded 13th apostle of Christ.  He brings his usual ironic style and hilarious assortment of facial reactions and steals more than half the laughs in the film.  And then there were Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, once again reprising their roles and Silent Bob and Jay (a trademark of Kevin Smith films, he finds a way to insert these two characters into almost every movie he does).  There were also bit parts for Salma Hayek, George Carlin and Alanis Morissette (as God).This is a entertaining film that missed its chance to be a classic religious parody by losing its soul and going off the deep end.  Still, if you have the ability to have a sense of humor about God, there is a lot of good comedy here.  I gave it a 7/10.  Religious zealots steer clear.  This movie will either offend you or shake your faith.

It happened to 'Being John Malkovich', and the result is a fantastic, witty, deeply weird-but-fun movie.Dogma is not quite 'Being John Malkovich' on the old bizarre-o-meter, but it is probably more daring. It tackles spiky subjects like religion (well, christianity and especially Catholicism) with a grace and devil-may-care attitude, that I am surprised Christian Fundamentalists didn't burn down all the theaters it ran in. (Hey, don't scoff, christians in the past  have used fire to solve most any problem).The two angels, Loki and BBy, played by the dynamic duo #1, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, are wonderfully cynical and, well, human. They have got God by his metaphysicals, and they're not gonna let him go.The dynamin duo #2, the token Jay and Silent Bob, loosen up the atmosphere when it once in a while gets a little complentative and heavy (it has to happen in a film like this), so that, all the time in this movie, you feel happy and joyous, even though it's demolishing church dogma before your very eyes.The plot does seem to lose a little direction in places, and too much of the understanding of the film hangs on you knowing a lot about Catholicism and listening to every word of the Demon's speech in the bar. But that doesn't matter. It toys so elegantly with its subject matter, that it's worth seeing just for that.In conclusion, don't boycott this film or anything stupid like that.

"},{"Title":"half brilliant, half inane film satire","Date":"14 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Most movies fail because they attempt too little;  `Dogma' fails because it attempts too much.  Given the option, I much prefer a film that goes down fighting to one that capitulates even before the battle has begun. Nevertheless, a miss is still a miss and `Dogma' falls far short of the potential it displays so admirably in its first half.  What begins as a wildly original, audacious and subtle satire about the place of institutionalized religion in modern American life, suddenly collapses midway into an undisciplined, unfocused and unfunny action comedy.Written and directed by Kevin Smith and boasting a topnotch cast of sizzling hot young actors, `Dogma' chronicles the attempt of two renegade angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) to sneak back into heaven under the auspices of an offer of  `plenary indulgence' that a New Jersey Catholic Church has set up as a come-on to beef up its membership roles.  The problem lies in the fact that, if these two are successful, they will prove God fallible for the first time, thus resulting in the termination of all existence.  Linda Fiorentino, in the film's most compelling performance, is the innocent young woman chosen to fulfill the modern Christ role by preventing the angels from passing through the church portals &#150; although, in this case, it is SHE who has been sent on a mission to save God, thus evening up the score apparently.The early sections of the film, as Smith lacerates much of the hypocrisy of organized religion, while at the same time, forcing us to evaluate anew the basis of much of Christianity's theological underpinnings, represent satirical filmmaking at its boldest and most creative.   Much of the humor derives from the flippant irreverence and utter domestication exhibited by these dual bands of ragtag celestial and earthbound beings (one the angels, the other comprised of the woman, Bethany, an original thirteenth apostle, a muse and two terrestrial prophets).  The film takes on an almost Oz-like quality as Bethany and her escorts fight off hostile forces bent on keeping them from arriving at their destination (in this case, not the Emerald City, but a gothic New Jersey cathedral).Unfortunately, about halfway through the film a scene occurs that breaks the spell and sets the movie off completely in the wrong direction.  While our intrepid pilgrims are sitting in a local nudie bar, a scatological demon emerges from the toilet in the restroom and wreaks havoc on the place and the people in attendance.  Suddenly, what started out as an intellectually challenging comedy of ideas degenerates into a lame action/adventure tale filled with overblown special effects, almost on a par with, heaven help us, `Mystery Men.'   This mood-shattering sequence becomes the blueprint for much of the film that follows, as the action becomes more and more inane, bloody and absurd and the humor, unfortunately, follows suit.   The initial tone of sly satirical wit becomes lost in a welter of pointless explosions, decapitations and the like, with slapstick replacing the earlier thought-provoking cleverness.  Thus, what promises to be one of the very finest, most ingenious and most original films of 1999, sadly, emerges as one the most frustrating and disappointing.  There is one consolation perhaps  the devout Catholics, who might indeed have taken umbrage at the searing attacks on their religion in the early sections of the film are unlikely to care by the end, as the film devolves more and more into unfocused silliness.  The film, by going so over the top, actually weakens its effect as either corrective or corrosive satire the farther it gets away from reality.  In this case, Smith has really no one but himself to blame. Rarely has a film of such quality and promise derailed itself so completely as `Dogma.'

He filmed the retail employee's bible in Clerks, did the big budget mainstream Hollywood film Mallrats, the painful but brutally honest love story Chasing Amy and now unleashes his take on organized religion and theology Dogma on the movie public.  Dogma is the story of two banished angels, Bartleby (Affleck) and Loki (Damon).  They were banished from Heaven for not doing God's will, and were sentenced to spend all man's lifetime in Wisconsin.  One day a newspaper article arrives in the mail and they find a loophole to return home, so they head for a church in (where else) New Jersey.  Their return would, of course, have disasterous consequences.  Proving God wasn't infallable and thus omitting the world as we know it.  The forces of Heaven and Hell then rally to prevent their entrance to the church.All the performances, from Ben Affleck's Bartleby to Chris Rock's 13th Apostle, Rufus are superbly written and acted by the performers.  There literally isn't a weak link in the entire film.  It is nice to see such Smith regulars as Brian O' Halloran or Jeff Anderson (Randall from Clerks).  Overall Dogma is not a indictment of religion or blasphemous, and any attempts to the contrary were only in it's favor at the box office.  This is the most well written, filmed, and acted film of Kevin Smith's career and the best part is knowing that he will only get better.4 out of 5 "},{"Title":"Cretinous fun","Date":"7 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" This is a sort of live-action Beavis and Butthead movie that tries to take on organized religion.

The story tells of two fallen angels, Loki and Bartleby (played by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), who have been suffering on Earth as immortals for many millenia after their expulsion from Heaven back in the old days. Suddenly, they've found a loophole in celestial logic that will allow them to return home to Heaven - through a church in (where else?) New Jersey. (And if you think entering Heaven through a church in NJ is weird enough, the two have been living all this time in Wisconsin.)   While Loki and Bartleby are journeying from Wisconsin to New Jersey, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is visited by an angel - the Voice of God, actually - in the middle of the night in her bedroom. Voice (Alan Rickman) informs Bethany that she must journey to New Jersey to stop the angels from re-entering heaven, and that she will be aided in her quest by two prophets, that if the two angels re-enter Heaven, all reality will cease to be, and so on and so forth. Now you or I might be overwhelmed by such an outlandish request, and so is Bethany, but with a little prodding by Voice, she relents.  And there's your plot, basically. Both the angels and Bethany are traveling to New Jersey (Red Bank, for those of you in the Garden State), although with different missions. Along the way, each runs into the requisite assortment of oddball characters. One of them is Rufus, the 13th Apostle (who claims he was left out of the Bible because he is black, and that Jesus Himself was black), played to the hilt by Chris Rock. Throw in George Carlin as a cardinal, Salma Hayek as another prophet, and Alanis Morrisette as God (don't worry, she doesn't speak, else your brain would melt and your heart would explode, or something like that), and you have one hell of a fun ride. Don't get me wrong, folks, this isn't a film of whimsey or non-stop mirth, but this is also not a overbearing, pompous, this-is-how-it-happened-and-damn-you-if-you-don't-believe-me kind of movie. In fact, although the closing scene isn't quite as good as the rest of the movie, this is one of the more intelligent films to come out in a while. One reason I feel this way is that there's hardly any plot contrivances - specifically, things tossed into the plot just for the sake of being there, rather than serving a purpose.

It wears a mantle of irreverent mockery and satire, but clearly this is a love letter of a liberal Catholic to his religious upbringing.  Which I have no problem with, Smith is just as entitled to his beliefs as anyone.  But this movie presents Catholicism as being the obviously correct religion rather smugly, and contradictingly.  At various points characters refer to opposing religions as being pieces of the same truth, or something like that...being equally valid.  Except, of course, the movie's cosmology is exclusively Catholic.  Also, the plot hinges around the sinister Azrael tricking two fellow fallen angels into entering this church and negating existence by proving God wrong (it's a long and not really convincing story).  But Azrael has been cast out of Heaven too.  So...why doesn't HE just enter the church?  Different rules for angels and demons are mentioned whenever it's convenient for the plot, without really making them seem plausible.The acting, especially Fiorentino and Rickman, who both look like they were going to fire their agents afterward, is pretty poor.  Although Rock shows some surprising dramatic range here and there, I must admit.  Of course Jay and Silent Bob (one joke wonders at best) are given way too much screen time.  Overall, this movie had a lot of promise, and in the hands of a more seasoned or talented writer and director might have been a truly great satiric piece.  But Smith is not that person.

Even End of Days, which was good, did more or less the same thing. As far as I'm concerned, all subjects should be open for parody, even issues concerning religion, and Dogma does it quite brilliantly, and very uncompromising.  This is a thoroughly original story, and it has dynamic and memorable characters, too. The entire cast was terrific, especially Ben Affleck, who for my money delivered his best performance yet.

It has an amazing cast.  It has an interesting and different topic.  It has Kevin Smith writing the dialogue.  It had everything going for it and, man, did it suck.Let's first get out of the way that I love Kevin Smith.  Ditto to Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, Chris Rock, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.  If an amusing film about religion can be made, these are the people who could do it.  Now, if only they actually pulled it off.Dogma dragged on and on.  There were large gaps of minutes where nothing was funny.  I felt that the audience, much like myself, was straining to find enjoyment in the movie.  We all wanted to like this movie.  Unfortunately, with the exception of the character of Jay, there wasn't much to like.I think there are three major sources for the failure of Dogma1. Linda Fiorentino.  I just didn't care about her.  She had no energy in this movie.  It seemed like she was irritated to be in the movie.  She just didn't fit in, which is a darn shame, considering she was the main character.2. Kevin Smith tried to expand himself as a writer/director.  More power to him, but don't forget what made you popular to begin with.  I don't need a movie with wall-to-wall sex jokes, but keep in mind that this is a comedy.  Yes, you can have serious issues in a comedy, but you can also try to fit in some jokes as well.3. Kevin Smith should write, not direct.  The clunky nature of Kevin Smith's directing is somewhat charming with his other movies, but Dogma required a more skilled hand.  It's Smith's first big film in scope-- with special effects and elaborate costumes to boot.  All the scenes seemed slightly off and uncomfortable.  It felt like a small-time movie doing a poor job at pretending to be a huge, Hollywood blockbuster.  If Kevin Smith teams up with a good director, the results would be amazing.Dogma could have been so much more and, as a result, it's the most disappointing movie of my recent memory.

Unfortunately, this will expose an error in God's plan, and will negate all creation.So, an angel (played by Alan Rickman) is sent to Earth to enlist the help of an abortion clinic worker (Linda Fiorentino) in preventing this from happening. Aided by the long-lost thirteenth deciple of Christ (Chris Rock) and two unlikely prophets (Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith, reprising the Jay and Silent Bob roles they created in earlier films), they make their way to New Jersey to a Catholic church run by a Cardinal (played to perfection by George Carlin), intent in modernizing much of Catholic tradition. It is here where the fallen angels and the band of defenders have their showdown.If you're expecting a film that trashes Christianity, you will be disappointed.

As the road trip continues, we learn that many of the Christian myths are really not myths Jesus was a black man, God is a woman, sex is a joke, etc. Dogma is part road-movie, part buddy-flick, part religious escapade, and, basically, it's The Bible The Comic Book!

Do you people JUST NOT CARE that half the characters added nothing to the film?  Does it not worry you that the ending was an incoherent jumble?  Do you really find Silent Bob funny?  I mean, how many times can you laugh at the 'guy says nothing for half an hour and then finally pipes up' gag?I have enjoyed Kevin Smith's work in the past, but Dogma fails to impress on any level.  It's not funny enough for a comedy (sure there's a few good lines, but at a strike rate of about one in twenty), it's not fast-paced enough for an action/adventure (and for large segments is just plain boring) and falls WAY SHORT of an intelligent critique of religion or the church.As for specific criticisms -- the film is no way 'controversial', and the 'theme' (if you can call it that) is nothing more than simplistic drivel- Chris Rock (aka Rufus the Apostle) is irritating and pointless- Salma Hayek makes Chris Rock look good- Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's characters are poorly developed and inconsistent- Jay is funny in small doses but gets way too much screen time- and Silent Bob reminded me of bad street theatre (like those crappy buskers you pass in the street that stand still for hours or mime that they're 'trapped in a glass box')All in all, I view this film as a missed opportunity.

He excels at what he normally does, ie. dialogue, but sadly, the film is too large-scale for the guy to direct. He does not know how to film a road-movie, which 'Dogma', in part, should be. The characters travel halfway across America - and what evidence do we have to prove this? One three-minute scene outside a broken-down car on the highway and quite a few shots in diners and the insides of trains... Never any landscape shots showing to create a feeling of space or how much distance has been covered.Smith as screenwriter seems immersed in some personal joke. Sure, often he is funny, but bringing out Jay and Silent Bob for a WHOLE FILM is somewhat stretching the point. They are wonderful cameo characters, but they do not make for an entire two hours entertainment. Despite their near-constant appearance in front of the camera they do little to forward the plot.

The cast is incredible with Affleck and Damon leading the way, Chris Rock, Jason Mewes and Fiorentino lending supporting roles and the classic Alan Rickman appearing as what else, the voice of God.  But what makes this ensemble cast work is Smith's script, this movie isn't about a couple of angels who try to end the world, its about a person's crusade for faith.  Its as if Bethany is so hell bent on going through the entire ordeal in hopes that the whole thing is a sham so she can lose her faith only to find that the little bit of faith she had in her enabled her to regain what she had lost since her childhood.Though I am a bigger fan of Clerks (37!) and Chasing Amy (Filled out like an application!) Dogma is definitely a fine stepping stone in Smith's attempt to put Red Bank, New Jersey on the map.

This movie is all over the genre map and somehow manages to remain a cohesive work.  It is a foul-mouthed, pop culture Kevin Smith flick, a bit of a mystery, a great road movie -without the stale coming of age elements- and, of course, it is a grand religious epic.  If you need verification on that last one just reread the bible and notice all the merciless killing and blood and guts.  The movie ultimately works because the religious stuff is structured into its own reality and Smith never acts like he doesn't believe that reality.  Sure its played for laughs, but he doesn't change the rules midstream. I never got the sense that he was throwing something in just for a joke and leaving the storyline of to the side until it was convenient to return.

I wish I could have loved this film as much as I loved Clerks, but I didn't.  I think that one reason this film and many of his ideas are not ready for the movie-going public is that he is so heavily based in comics.  Dogma plays like a live-action comic.  I believe he is one director who could do any comic book character well, especially Superman, which was dropped.It was great to see so much of my hometown in the film, too bad it had to represent Wisconsin.  But, that's our lot in life, Pittsburgh seldom gets the credit in a great film - see Silence of the Lambs for the finest example of no screen credit.  I really loved that the nun at the airport was played by none other than Lady Elaine from Mister Rogers' neighborhood.  With the loss of Don Brockett (Chef Brockett) a few years ago, perhaps she will get the most cameos in 'Burgh films.Kevin Smith is young and fresh.  His movies, especially this one, reflect that.  There are some points of contention in the film that make Catholics angry.  I haven't heard this much commotion since Last Temptation of Christ.  At any rate, I think given some support from the film community, Kevin can add an interesting voice to the chorus.

Smith occasionally produces moments of utter brilliance, egRickman's deeply moving account of how he had to persuade the boy Jesus to take on his saviourhood;the subversion of the church's desire to become 'hip';the entire sequence with the mute God;the review of accepted Biblical content;the (under-explored) tension between Catholicism and abortion.In fact, it's when Smith becomes theological that the film succeeds, even if his standpoint is questionable. Unfortunately, the film as a film is a mess - too many characters, glib dialogue which throws away the jokes, clumsy editing, and a plot which seems to have been stitched together in a hurry. This looks like a half-finished screenplay, an early draft in need of trimming.Thank goodness, then, for the talent on offer Linda Fiorentino's performance is robust and occasionally profound, and she carries the entire movie. Matt and Ben aren't given enough to do, and the film squanders their obvious talent. Rickman doesn't surprise, since he is usually splendid. Other characters can annoy more than produce enjoyment (Hayek, Rock, and particularly Mewes - this is my first Kevin Smith film, and I was sick of Mewes by the end, so God knows how all the people who've seen Amy and Clerks must think of him).I enjoyed the film very much, despite these flaws, but wish Smith had taken his time and put the script through some more re-drafts, because we might have had a masterpiece.

It's all here - the Force (Christianity, God, whatever); the battle between good and evil (or good, mad and nihilistic);  the mythic, picaresque plot in which the hero(ine) is given a quest, and gathers (or is given) friends to help her complete it); the ordinary Jo(sephin)e who is plucked out, seemingly at random, to save the universe, but actually has significant family secrets; the ambiguous Vadar-like villains who have turned from good, and whose actions threaten the universe; the intergalactic (or whatever you call the spiritual realm) arena against which all of this is played out, which, for some reason, always has to have its locus in bad acting.DOGMA also has most of the flaws of the last STAR WARS farrago - a substitution of mythic hokum for plot, which means that the narrative limps forever, while the filmmakers make it up as they go along, and climactic moments are signalled by noise and music, because they don't arise naturally out of the drama; the bogging down of narrative with reams of interminably tedious talk - the fact that it's based on an actual religion rather than Lucasian mumbo-jumbo doesn't make it any less ridiculous; the privileging of this talk by ignoring all the resources of the cinema; lousy special effects (although with a low budget, Smith has more of an excuse); the assembling of a prestigious cast and then wasting them by making them either dull or the butts of bad jokes.I can't see why there was such a fuss in America about the blasphemy of this film - it's one of the most right-wing works I've seen in ages.  The heroine begins the film working in an abortion clinic, and ends it pregnant; her independent crisis of faith is repeatedly attacked by 'advisory' male figures; for all her importance as an action figure, she is a very passive character whose actions are dictated by men.  The conceit that the figure authorising this is a woman changes nothing - the film's creator is a man, and femaleness is just a ridiculous form this deity takes.The link between the film's creation and God's creation should not be underestimated.  The two most important figures in this incessant talkfest are, perversely, wordless - Silent Bob and God.  Both are seemingly marginalised, but it is Bob, standing for the director (both the same man) who creates the conditions in the film for Bethany to succeed.  This silence is ironic, because what he is defending is the Word of God.  Jacques Derrida once argued that Western culture was logocentric, i.e. based on the Christian idea of Jesus being 'The Word Made Flesh' - that all creative acts are an embodiment of Christian tradition.This film is one such act - Kevin Smith speaks for God, orders chaos, offers a very traditional story with a very traditional resolution, that upholds the very order he superficially seems to mock with this fruitcake ice-hockey loving God, irreverent angels, foulmouthed prophets, corrupt Catholics. Every age presents the Christian message in its own image, but that actual message is unchanging.One looks in vain for any undermining of this in the film.  Its failure is especially glaring when compared to the greatest ever film about religion, Bunuel's THE MILKY WAY.  That too was full of words, doctrines, dogmas, but Bunuel as an ex-Catholic, atheist, Surrealist and rigorous intellectual, was able to structure his film, show the disparity between the babble and the way it is filmed, opening up space for irony, analysis and critique.  The word most definitely was not made flesh.  There's no such disparity here, and the discourse rarely rises above the level of trivial laughs.  Only the acting could have saved it, but these smart-ass performers couldn't break into pathos for fear they'd crack - they're SO cool they can't hear us laughing at them.DOGMA isn't all bad - how many comic-fantasies about religion are we getting from mainstream(ish) Hollywood?  The best bits come from the tension between the ethereal crises that is the subject of the film, and the crass, laddish, often hilarious, earthy humour that is its content, courtesy, as ever, of Jay  and Silent Bob.  There are a couple of good jibes about gender and sexuality; religion and mythology; free will and destiny; but all are subsumed in the film's very conservative project.  Kevin Smith's terminal decline since CLERKS is, then, briefly halted, but only just.

But the films even states that it shouldn't be taken seriously. Simply put - Even God has a sense of humour. Inevitably this is never the case. Dealing with a touchy subject like religion, even the slightest variation of the holy text may cause mass hysteria. Even those that tend to intelligently dissect the film fall flat on their faces by the very virtue that this is not a history lesson, but live action comic-style adaptation loosely based around Christian faith. Bollocks to Theological research and the history lesson, this is entertainment. Ironically, it's now well-known that Kevin Smith is a devout Catholic, and the film whilst it distorts the bible in that Kevin Smith comic book kind of way, is just paying respect to its subject matter in a weird kind of way. Ironic again that Smith should infiltrate the ranks of protestors outside his own house and join in. That's one way of marketing your movie.Once again, and thankfully, Jay and Silent Bob, return doing their usual hilarious thing. Silent Bob easily being the funniest character in the film. Do you think Smith had something to do with that? With some rousing performances from buddies Ben and Matt (Affleck and Damon, otherwise known as) and a typically cold humoured, Linda Fiorentino, I felt that Alan Rickman was a strange choice for the Voice of God, Metatron. Chris Tucker was at his usual loudmouth, in-your-face humour and let's just say Selma was good at doing her Latino thing(s) in a breasty performance. Two hoots for a funny cast and magnificent script with razor-sharp dialogue.Foul language and bags of dirty jokes apart, this film is a contemporary look at the Good Book. Throughout the film there is always an underlying message and the film ends typical Hollywood style - everyone's happy and faith is restored. A not-so-subtle subliminal message.

Or just because Hollywood just can't have it that someone else in the industry makes a little money and has some succes. The young film maker usually can't resist the temptations of Hollywood, and take offers they can't refuse. This time it happens to Kevin Smith, who made a hit a few years ago with his entertaining little movie Clerks. Since then he made two other movies in Hollywood, and now he has made a Hollywood monstrosity a movie that should have been an off- beat comedy, but now, despite ( or because of)  all the Hollywood millions and technology and big names, turns out to be over the top and just not funny most of the time. It's a story about two fallen angels ( Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) who are trying to get back to heaven. By divine intervention a woman ( Linda Fiorentino) is appointed to try to stop them. On that mission she meets all kind of strange people angels, prophets, apostels, demons and even God. Damon and Affleck give a reprise of John Travolta and Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction constantly talking all the time. ( By the way I never understood all the fuzz about Damon and Affleck; they're good actors and their debut Good Will Hunting was a solid Hollywood movie, but in fact I think they're a bit boring and have no real edge. Damon for instance, was completely played of the screen by Edward Norton, a REAL new acting talent, in Rounders two years ago.) Alan Rickman ( a very fine actor) is an angel and tries hard to save his role, but does not really succeed. If you want to see him as an angel ( or something like that) go and see Truly, Madly, Deeply; in this film he's really great! The director himself reappears in his by now well known role of Silent Bob. Finally it's about time there comes an end to the gimmick of constantly citing and displaying  knowledge of other movies by characters.

Some consider it to be anti-religious.  Others see it as a satire of organized religion.  I consider it to be one of the finest and most profound faith-related films I've seen for a long time, maybe even ever.I myself am not Catholic, exactly.  I'm a Christian, of which Catholicism is a branch of.  Part of me is, honestly, somewhat surprised I even took the time to see Dogma, what with how it was condemned by various churches and all, but I also heard that it spurs a lot of thought concerning religion and beliefs.  Still, I guess what is important is that I saw it.  Also, I'm not a fan of Kevin Smith's films.  Actually, I might be after seeing Dogma, which is the first of Smith's films I've ever seen.  I've heard of Chasing Amy, and it's been recommended to me, but I've never seen it.  I may have to now.The real misunderstanding about Dogma, I think, is the language.  Admittedly, there is an awful lot of language, probably too much.  Particularly the character of Jay (Jason Mewes) spouts profanities like it's going out of style.  It is also somewhat unusual to have a priest played by none other than George Carlin, the last person one would expect to see in a film dealing so much with religion.  Maybe it's also that God is played by none other than Alanis Morissette.  Still, it's easy to see why it could be seen as anti-religious.  The fact is, Kevin Smith has things of real value to say about the church, and, even though he says them in ways that may be offensive to some people, he does say them.  For me, the film was not offensive, perhaps because I have a high level of tolerance for that type of material.I recommend Dogma to anyone who is struggling with their faith, anyone who wants something to think about for a while, but also people who are not easily offended.  For me, Dogma has, if nothing else, made me interested in getting back to the Bible, and really uncovering more of it.  Dogma makes religion alive and kicking, particularly in the form of personal faith, even though its ways of doing so are more than a little bit unorthodox.Personally, I believe that God has a sense of humor.  I think, upon seeing Dogma, he laughed.  He may have covered his ears a few times, but he still laughed, and he also probably saw a lot of good in Dogma.  I know I did.**** out of ****.

In sum, Dogma is more good than bad. It is irreverent, insulting, irreligious (a crucified Christ needing a makeover?), profane, and ultimately profound.  Interspersed between its 'Animal House' sick humor are questions of faith that philosophers and theologians have debated for centuries.  Does God exist and if so, why it is a God of peace as well as vengeance?  Why does a benevolent God allow free will, knowing that those who deny God will be eternally damned?  What is the role of religion if those beliefs only serve to divide rather than unite human beings?  Does the Bible tell us everything we need to know about faith or are there other ways to know God?  Writer and director Kevin Smith has slyly thrown these issues at us in a seemingly haphazard way with a skillful ensemble of non-too serious actors starting with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to George Carlin to the two Jasons (Lee and Mewes) to Alan Rickman to Chris Rock and finally lovely and sexy Salma Hayek and Linda Fiorentino. Dogma is, after all, entertainment.  If we care to think things more carefully, that is a bonus.  Bethany is the unwitting 'last scion', chosen to the save the world from the fallacies of a papal edict.  She pairs up with two sex-craved prophets, one foul-mouthed and the other mute (save for a hilarious line after throwing two people off the train), finds a naked African-American angel who falls from the sky on cue, meets a muse who claims credit for 19 of the top 20 money making films, and ultimately defeats the forces of evil by using her seemingly lost faith.  Along the way, Dogma takes pot shots at John Hughes films, the Walt Disney enterprise (using a pig figure as idolatry), and Catholicism fixated on, what else, dogma.  Dogma isn't for everyone.  But if you can take in helpings of Kevin Smith sermons in between some juvenile humor such as a s**t demon arising from the commode, angels without genitalia, the State of Wisconsin as a place worse than hell, and an avenging angel who nearly kills an innocent woman because she didn't say 'God Bless You' when he sneezed, then by all means enjoy.

His disclaimer prologue was nothing more than grade-school smart-alec humour, the same attitude carries on until the film closes.Dogma is about two fallen angels who have found a loop-hole which would get them back to Heaven.  In fact, the whole movie is about loop-holes.  Smith frequently uses obscure Biblical passages to advance the plot.  As a result, the film quickly loses its momentum, and I could not help feeling dragged.The issues raised by various characters throughout the movie (e.g., Is Jesus black?  Is God female, etc.,) are nothing out of the ordinary if not trivial.  There is absolutely no intelligence or inspiration to them. Sunday school teachers probably get questions like these almost every other week.Finally, there is the ending.  I won't give anything away (I am quite sure you'd know by now,) but it simply has the word Hubris written all over.All in all, Smith's portrayal of religion in Dogma is not only immature. It also shows that, like his wallet, his wit is growing thicker by the day. Even a quasi-all-star cast won't save the world of Dogma from Armageddon.

This one, at two-and-a-half-hours is supposed to be a sharp religious satire, but Smith must have forgotten the golden rule of comedy with few exceptions, anything over 90 minutes in duration ceases to be funny. Labeled as an attack on the Catholic Church, the movie gets muddled in its own politics and itself becomes preachy along the way. For the most part, the acting feels amateurish and sitcom-like, almost necessitating a laugh-track, while the few truly hillarious jokes are lost in the plot's thickness. By the end, Dogma begins to resemble one of those lumbering Biblical epics of the 50's (only in its modern incarnation for the cynical Generation Y) more than such irreverent celebrations of slackerism as Clerks and Mallrats. Jay and Silent Bob, the duo left over from Kevin's last three flicks, contribute to the movie's few moments of what feels like comic relief, and when a comedy actually requires the later, it obviously needs some major fixing.

Like Álex de la Iglesia's Day of the Beast, it starts off strong, but fades.  While it maintains full speed very far into the film, the apocalyptic ending plays like (dare I say it) something out of Clerks.  But it is still worth watching.Unlike intellectual ex-Protestants, who typically become simply secular, most intellectual ex-Catholics still feel the need to grapple with a rich maze of doctrine and dogma. (Besides Day of the Beast, the same phenomenon can be observed in Godard's Hail Mary). Although a few random non-Catholic elements find their way into Dogma (a muse, the name Loki), it is a very Catholic film, little though the church will like it.  Whereas Samuel Jackson's Vengeful God in Pulp Fiction is doubtless a Protestant God or perhaps an Old Testament God, part of the fun of Dogma is that is supposes an unquestionably Catholic God, then sneaks in Alanis Morisette at the end to portray a God totally unrecognizable to the Catholic tradition.I like the idea of there being multiple factions in the fight between Heaven and Hell, an Azrael rebelling against even Lucifer, amoral angels walking the earth mired in the technicalities of dogma, seeking loopholes in doctrine, messing with the natives for lack of any other way to pass the time.The film is visually well conceived (if never riveting - perfectly good to catch this on video), the acting is generally good (although Salma Hayek's acting falls rather short of her beauty), there are enough twists and turns to keep any but the most hyperactive mind paying attention, and (rather unusually for an American movie) it actually expects its audience to know something and to be paying attention.

If you haven't heard of this controversial film yet, it deals with religion, in particular the teachings of the bible, and as a result will invariably offend some people. Especially with the way this movie portrays religion.Dogma is a story about two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) who were banished from heaven by God for some past mischievous acts. In a desperate attempt to get back into heaven, the two angels planned to exploit a loophole in God's teachings by passing through the arches of a church in New Jersey on a particular day. However if they are successful in doing this, they will inadvertently erase the existence of man and everything God created by proving that God is not perfect. In an attempt to stop this, God's messenger (Alan Rickman) recruits the help of a special mortal (Linda Fiorentino) to prevent the two angels from reaching New Jersey and passing through the arches of the church. Along the way Fiorentino meets up with two bumbling prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith - director) and Rufus, the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) who help her in her quest.If you were expecting a fancy Hollywood movie, you'll be disappointed. This has the feel and look of a low budget B movie but in this case, special effects and bright lights weren't needed. The humor was laced throughout and quite funny and the cast was very good, especially Rickman's character. The only thing that I question was the director's (Kevin Smith) choice for God. I realize he wanted to show that God is not this serious being but a fun loving deity but I found having Alanis Morissette portray God completely irritating.As a warning to anyone who wants to see this movie, there is an incredible amount of foul language and sexual dialogue. This may be the source of many people's dislike for this movie as it is combining religion and toilet humor together but it definitely makes for an entertaining time.Overall, I liked this movie. It took a very serious topic and showed to everyone that it is not necessary to take religion so rigidly, nor should it be the end all and be all of how you live. My suggestion though is that if religion is something that you take very seriously then don't see this movie.

YES!Can a Kevin Smith film honestly critique the dogmas of the Catholic Church? YES!Can a Kevin Smith film explore the subtleties of the relationship between the Mother Church and her faithful? YES!Can a Kevin Smith film be made anywhere besides New Jersey?  NO WAY IN HELL!Ingmar Bergman shared his reservations concerning belief in God in his film Seventh Seal.  Woody Allen did likewise in his films Hanna and her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors. Scorsese showed us his interpretation of faith with the film The Last Temptation of Christ.  And Monty Python showed us the comic side of religion in The Life of Brian.Now, Kevin Smith, one of the most talented writer/directors of the 90's, gives us his spin on religion and faith in his latest Jersey flick Dogma. Despite what some protesters are saying this film is neither anti-Catholic nor anti-Christian.  Blasphemous, yes; offensive, yes; but it does NOT question those who believe in a higher power, unlike Bergman and Allen (and to a certain extent, Python...)Smith is giving us his own personal take on life as a Catholic, a subject that he obviously knows quite a bit.  This film is a bizarre mix of very serious observations about Catholicism and faith, mixed in with the usual potty humor found in Clerks, Mall Rats and Chasing Amy.   Although the mixing of faith with profanity does not come off quite as well as Smith may have liked; still it's not as uncommon as one would think in the real world.   The profanity serves as a comical counterpoint to the weightier subjects of Catholic dogma.While I've heard it said that Director Smith uses profanity and taboo to shock his audience, I find it only to be shocking to those who aren't familiar with the particular aspect of American culture Smith is trying to represent on film.   Yes dear reader, there are millions in the US of A who talk and act much like the characters in Kevin's movies; I know, I used to be one of them!   He's showing us the dark side of the white American middle and lower-middle class-- something one rarely sees portrayed on a Hollywood screen, though they make up the majority of the population of this country.   (The under 21 crowd is particularly obnoxious...)Sadly, I found the humor in Dogma concerning the black Jesus and God is woman to be a bit too cliché for my tastes.   I've heard those lines before, in a variety of situations, and did not find Smith's recycling of this old material to be either funny or particularly effective.   It was more offensive than anything.   Also, Smith, to make the jokes funny, plays fast and loose with Christian theology.  The problem being that those not familiar with theology may take the jokes as being serious criticisms. For instance the big cover-up concerning the fact of God's femininity, or the big cover-up concerning the black apostle, who was intentionally left out of the Bible due to the racist tendencies of the church.    While there's some interesting points to be made with these attempts at humor, they somehow just don't work as well as they should, and I feel many moviegoers may miss the point of the joking.On the other hand, Smith makes some very accurate and honest observations concerning Catholicism.   My personal favorite is how Catholics tend to mourn their faith rather than celebrate it, even thought the word celebrate is used more by Catholic clergy than by all Protestant ministers combined!  In the Catholic Church, celebrate has an almost Orwellian double-speak meaning when the celebrant mentions the word, the congregation simply substitutes self-flagellation in its place.   (This is one point that Bergman got right in his classic Seventh Seal)   It's no wonder that those Catholic churches in the US that are prospering are those which play down Catholic dogmas and borrow heavily from the Protestant traditions.Believe it or not, Dogma is actually performing a service to the American Catholic Church, and those Catholic clergy who dare see it will be well advised to take note of the criticisms.   They are not hateful in any way; but they are brutally honest.Just one aside Kevin, why did you portray the heroine of the film as a being from McHenry, Illinois?    The only reason that came to my mind is that McHenry is just a few miles south of the Illinois/Wisconsin border, so the heroine is on a rather equal footing with the two fallen angels in Wisconsin in terms of time and distance to get to Jersey.   The reason I found the use of McHenry as being odd is that the town, along with the county it's in (also named McHenry) is one of the most conservative, pro-life, pro-religion, pro-Republican bastions in all of the fifty states, let alone Illinois.   If someone in McHenry were so bold as to even mention the phrase Planned Parenthood they would be immediately tarred, feathered, and strung up from the nearest lamp pole.   Abortion clinics simply do not exist in McHenry!   It is, however, a very Catholic area, with about 50% of the population of the county being associated with Roman Catholicism.  For those of you who don't know Illinois, pretty much the entire state is similar to how I described McHenry.   Democrats, liberals, homosexuals, and pro-choice activists are forced to live in designated areas of Cook County (where Chicago is...) East St. Louis, and a handful of college towns.By the way, Damon and Affleck are superb in their roles as Loki and Bartleby.I don't know if it was intentional, but I liked the little tribute to the John Sayles' film Lone Star in the scene where Bethany and the angel are sitting in the Mexican restaurant.  In the background you can hear the same music Sayles uses for the opening credits in Lone Star.

Without going into any spoilers, the whole plot will be more comprehensible if you have some familiarity with Catholic teachings, but a general knowledge of Christian lore will probably be enough to enjoy the film.  It does contain some windy dime store philosophy, but I don't think it really gets in the way too much.

The outward trappings and organizational aspects sometimes cloud our view of how simple our religion really is- love one another and believe that God loves us.  Beyond that, this is also a very funny and well thought out story.Lastly- a comment for all of those people who felt they had to protest this movie because of its criticism of the Church- anyone whose faith is so weak that it can be destroyed by a movie, really has no faith worth protecting.

Humans are the only creatures that fall under the church's jurisdiction in that area.2.An indulgence only works if the recipient is actually sorry for their sins.  This may be the case in this movie, but should be noted for accuracies's sake.3.Angels cannot become humans.4. Angels are annatomically correct.  The book of Genesis records how angels and mortal women had children together.  Hence the angels must have had some kind of genitalia.5. Muses are not part of Catholic theology.  They are part of Greek myth.6. Loki is the name for the Norse God of mischief, not the name of an angel.That said, I would like to express my dislike for the self-pity that Linda Forentino's character shows.  She merely follows the pattern of people who blame God for their own choices.  She made a conscious choice to have sex, then to have an abortion, which led to her predicament at the start of the movie, so she illicits no sympathy from me. I did like Alan Rickman's part though.

The array of actors in this cast playing some pretty unlikely parts, such as George Carlin as a Cardinal and Chris Rock as the apostle Rufus, not to mention Selma Hayek and Alanis Morisette, make the movie.

Think about it, what has been the truly religious film out this year? STIGMATA? END OF DAYS? Where they use religion like a B-movie?I am very tempted to say this movie was better than CHASING AMY. But it's hard to compare the two. Though it features alot of the same characters from AMY, and uses the same Kevin Smith elements as in all his movies (Jay and Silent Bob have the longest screen time than in any of the others), DOGMA uses a good chunk of special effects and violence, but surprisingly it doesn't ruin the film, though it comes to the verge.Linda Fiorentino was such a smart choice for her main role as the only one who can stop fallen angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) from re-entering Heaven and thereby proving God fallible and destroying everything living. It's confusing, I know, there's so many other things going on also. But don't fret, it's not MISSION IMPOSSIBLE or CHINATOWN.You'd think you would be sick of seeing Ben Affleck and Matt Damon together again, but they work so well as Bartleby and Loki. Ben Affleck's character is the one that truly changes over the course of events, but I was surprised at how good of an actor Matt Damon is. For a long time he's played the same sort of characters, but here, he plays the sidekick masterfully (somehow his voice sounds different too).There's alot of characters and cameos in this movie, which I think is also different for Kevin Smith. Sure, he's always had a handful of slackers thrown in to keep the comedy flowing, but you were always paying attention to the main characters, which usually consisted of a guy, his oddball friend, and the one or two love interests. But here, due to the much more serious subject matter, we have an epic cast. George Carlin, Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman (seriously, folks!!), and Chris Rock all have important roles. Not to mention Jason Lee, who is menacingly good here, and cameos from Smith alumni Dwight Ewell and Brian O'Halloran.One more thing I would like to mention is Chris Rock. At first I thought he was going to be this hollering apostle using his usual black vs. white schtick comedy routine. Not to mention a bad actor (hopefully this movie will redeem him from CB4 and LETHAL WEAPON 4), but as the movie went on he conquered both hilarious and dramatic obsticles. He even came off as sweet a few times. This is his best appearance on film since the pork rib purchase in I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA!!I didn't know if I was going to like this movie at first. It sounded promising, but the trailers in the movie theater weren't too funny. But I think that was Smith keeping all the good parts behind the curtain (smart move). SEE THIS MOVIE!! The only thing that MIGHT be offensive, I thought, was Carlin's cigarette smoking, sell-out priest, but like the message in the beginning says (among other things) it's all a comedy fantasy!

First, it's a very funny movie.  Here, Smith has fleshed out the Jay and Bob characters and spread their presence out over the entire film; something that could have been annoying but instead was very effective.  Chris Rock added that essential edgy comic spark, and the role-reversals of Matt and Ben worked very well to comic ends.  Otherwise, the funny-'cause-it's-true cracks at the Church are well-written and dead-on.Second, it's a much less scathing look at Catholicism than the protesters would have one believe.  It rarely, if all, attacks the followers of the religion but instead the corruption at the very top.  This is nothing that has never been said before, and George Carlin's presence is a good reminder of that.  Third, it's a film that's very aware of itself escapes the gratutity that often comes with younger, less mainstream comedies that have become more recognizable by the general public.  However, it's not as good as Clerks.  It's about as good as Mallrats.  It's a little better than Chasing Amy.  Why?  I don't know.  I didn't like Chasing Amy as much as everyone else seemed to, perhaps because I dislike both Joey Lauren Adams and Ben Affleck.  But I think the thing that hurts this film the most is the thing that makes it such a tremendous work - that it has to set up a huge, complex mythology, and it takes a lot of time to explain all the references and characters.  Smith did the best he could, but explanatory lines just have a way of killing scenes.  Thankfully, the acting picked it up a bit (Rickman was huge.) In DOGMA, Kevin Smith makes a good case for compassionate Catholicism - and, while it's a funny, effective film, I still can't agree with his flawed philosophy.  But I recommend it it's quite a ride.

So much of its reputation is based on the (somewhat justified) ravings of Catholic interest groups, who claim that it's sacrilegious -- which it is.  As some have pointed out, the writers of this movie have gotten away with the sort of faith-bashing and community-bashing that would never be tolerated if it were a satire of the Muslim faith or the Black community -- or Judaism, Hinduism, the Chinese, the Mexicans, et al.That said, if you don't think about the theological holes in the premise of the movie (there are many -- ask any theologian, not necessarily a Catholic one;  I'm sure that even a well-read Atheist will agree), this is an extremely funny movie, from the opening (Catholicism -- WOW!) through the zany group of pilgrims on the Chicago-to-Jersey route, up until the finale -- with Alanis Morrisette, she of angst-Alternative fame, playing the silent Deity.  Like the potty-mouthed little kids on South Park, the sheer outrageousness of the characters  sets up a movie-full of laughs.Ignore the theological implications, becuase if you think about them long enough they'll only detract from the movie.

And isn't that ultimately what ALL religions are about. Not tithing, meat restrictions, dress codes and such.  And I think Kevin Smith does a great job at portraying this.  Most of the main characters in the movie love and server God loyally.  Bartleby and Lokei (spelling?) long to be back in heaven, back in the presence of God. Where is this idea anti-religious? But a lot of people won't get the positive message Kevin Smith is trying to deliver because they will never get past the language and a few jokes (ok and if anybody thinks the Jesus Dude is a little corny, try seeing some of the other ideas Catholics have come up with to boost attendance) In conclusion, its a great movie with a great cast who deliver honest performances.

In fact, he's from somewhere around where I used to live. I'm glad boring New Jersey has added someone to Hollywood. With Dogma, Smith proves he knows what he's doing. Although, his only other film I've seen is Clerks, I found it both original and hysterical. Dogma is a very smart comedy that focuses on the problems with Christianity today. It doesn't attack the religion, but rather points out that it has become less effective and meaningful to people. It criticizes the ways in which people have misinterpreted it.Dogma is a story of two angels, thrown out of heaven ages ago for disobeying God. The two, Loki and Bartleby, decide that they no longer wish to stay on earth and plan to return home. With the discovery of a loophole in a New Jersey Church, their quest is possible. However, should they be successful in their return to heaven, the will of God would be defeated and the world would cease to exist. This provides for a very interesting story. Dogma sees the return of Jay and Silent Bob who have appeared in each one of Kevin Smith's movies. They are funny once again. The film features great writing and several interesting dialogues. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are great together as the two fallen angels. Linda Fiorentino, a non believer, is chosen as the world's savior and Chris Rock plays the 13th apostle. This becomes a very interesting situation. Each person attempts to impose his beliefs on another. The conversations are both entertaining and humorous. Serious talk about religion is mixed in with swearing and joking producing colorful dialogue. Although it is mostly conversation, the film fascinated me and kept me interested. Kevin Smith shows that he can not only talk about things in an interesting way, but also that he can talk about very interesting things.The only problem that I had with the film is the ending. I don't know why, but I just found it not as satisfactory as I thought it might be. There's nothing wrong with it in particular, but I might have been expecting something more spectacular. I also thought that at times the characters seemed to talk about religious facts endlessly. It was as if they would just stand aside and break away from the flow of the film simply to discuss some element of Christianity. Nevertheless this is a very funny and colorful film.

I have been a fan of Smith's since his breakthrough picture Clerks, and any Smith fan will not be disappointed with this film.  Here, Smith tells the story of two fallen angels who are trying to find a way back into heaven and the people charged with stopping them.  This very original concept is exploited in order to ask many questions about the nature of God and the nature of man.  That and it contains the requisite (and always funny) dick and fart jokes.Linda Fiorentino grounds the picture by giving a down-to-earth performance as the mortal who must stop the renegade angels.  Jay and Silent Bob are along to help her, and as usual, are hilarious.  I guess there really isn't anything bad to say about Dogma.

I even loved the extremely underrated Mallrats. His best of the first three did go to Chasing Amy. Now, with Dogma, it is Smith's most ambitious picture. It took on the controversial subject of religion and played its satire and takes it seriously at the same time. Boy, were there some really funny moments.The best thing about Kevin Smith is that he puts so much effort into his dialogue. His characters engage in long conversation in all his movies that are never too long and always interesting. Here, his characters spit back and forth about their views of religion and explaining the plot, which was informing me even more by the next scene. The performances were pretty good. Linda Fiorentino is perfect here and is a fierce and compelling actress. She gave one of the best female performances of the 90's with The Last Seduction, where she was unjustly robbed of a Best Actress Academy Award nomination. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do their Matt Damon and Ben Affleck thing, but it still works. The movie does brighten up a bit whenever they come on screen. They work well together even though they give each other too much exposure outside of the movies. Chris Rock is pretty funny here because Smith gave him some pretty colorful phrases to work with. Jason Mewes as Jay is at his funniest here than any of Smith's previous movies. Unfortunately, I was rather bored whenever Alan Rickman came on the screen. For me, his tired and aging look took away from his performance and sort of brought the film down. Oh, well. Lately, I have become very distracted with Salma Hayek. She has lost the spark and fire I enjoyed so much in Desperado and Fools Rush In. She is, well, okay, here, but at least she made up for her ridiculous eye-candy role in Wild Wild West.

After that point, I found myself laughing rarely and never wholeheartedly.

It didn't.  The reason the threatened boycotts from the Catholic Church never materialized was because a few of them probably watched it and realized the attacks being made were so pathetic and inane that they weren't worth the response.  Mostly they were the same claims that have been made against the church for centuries and are as baseless now as they always have been.  Another movie repeating the same old stuff was hardly worth their bother.  And then the supposedly controversial parts? Jesus was dark skinned?  I don't think that's news to anybody.  God might be considered using female terminology?  Nothing new there.  I can't say these were exactly hard-hitting theological questions Kevin was raising there.

His new comedy, Dogma, takes on the Catholic church and organized religion, (a formidable task) in a hilarious, yet thought-provoking way.  This is Smith's most sophisticated film yet, both in its narrative and its cinematography.  He's come a long way from the black-and-white security cameras of Clerks.I won't waste your time with a plot summary here, but I would like to comment on some impressive performances.  Linda Fiorentino won her way back into my favor with her portrayal of Bethany, a Catholic who has lost her faith.  Fiorentino has skads of lines that are life-changing realizations and adages to live by, but she delivers them with such believability that it works.  Smith's poignant dialogue could have come off as cliched with another actress.   Jason Mewes and Smith are, as always, comedically perfect as Jay and Silent Bob, respectively.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who I'm always hoping that I won't like, are charming as two fallen angels. Affleck, especially, does a marvelous job with his dialogue.  (Great monologue, Ben!) And the charismatic Chris Rock, often still in his stand-up persona, is well-placed as the black thirteenth apostle.  Alan Rickman, although looking old underneath pale foundation and eyeliner, is his usual fantastic.  My only qualm with the casting is the use of Salma Hayek. Yes, she's beautiful, but I haven't seen her in an American film YET where her acting has been up to par.All in all, Smith takes on a lot of issues here.  His narrative has never been better crafted, his dialogue has never been sharper, and he has never been more daring.  Kudos to Kevin for making a film that I will be telling everyone I know to go and see.

For instance, along with some wonderfully effective ribald humor, told through the story of slacker icons Dante and Randall, CLERKS manages to pose such questions - familiar to any who have set through a semester of Philosophy 101 - as what is freedom?, what is duty?, and does man have an essential nature?. In addressing such universal questions through some rather particular characters and situations, Smith can perhaps be seen as a truly contemporary American version of the European auteur, i.e., a worthy successor to such trailblazers as Bunuel, Fellini, and in particular, Bergman (albeit, one with pee pee and caca jokes - though Fellini could also get rather lowbrow). If DOGMA, Smith's most ambitious film to date is any indication, his clear intelligence, honesty, and originality are such that he may eventually come to rank among the great directors in cinema history.While not without its flaws, DOGMA is very much worth seeing (and thinking about afterward). In a nutshell, DOGMA tells the story of two fallen angels (played by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) who have a plan to get back into heaven; the only catch is that in carrying it out, they would negate all existence. In order to stop them, a rather lapsed (though still ritualistic) Catholic (Linda Fiorentino) is summoned by God herself (Alanis Morrissette) via a heavenly messenger (Alan Rickman) to prevent the fallen pair from carrying out their plan. More help is offered to her by both Chris Rock as a wisecracking 13th apostle (who says of Christ (who here happens to be Black) the nigger owes me money) and the ubiquitous (and scene stealing) Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself). Structured like a comic book action tale, DOGMA manages to offer both comedy and some rather thought provoking reflection along the way on the nature of faith in general and on faith via adherence to Catholicism in particular.Not all of the comedy works; some of the humor feels a bit strained; but when the movie is funny, it is very funny indeed (including in both the opening credits and in a much deserved and not altogether veiled attack on the hypocrisy of the Disney corporation (which cowardly refused to distribute this film)). Fans of Smith's earlier works will also appreciate the occasional references back to these. At times, the story line became somewhat infocused. In general, however, the focus was there.As far as being an intelligent reflection on faith, I believe that this comes directly from Kevin Smith the person, a person who sees both the good and the elements of absurdity of organized religion.

The acting isn't all that hot, to be honest, but that's why most Kevin Smith fans will find this movie appealing.

However, Dogma isn't intended as a bold, revolutionary gesture, and never was. Kevin Smith has said from the beginning that the movie was never intended to be anything but an amusing little movie that would make people laugh and get them thinking about God. It isn't an attack on organized religion as a whole, it isn't an attack on Christianity as a whole, and it certainly isn't anti-Catholic by any stretch of the imagination; Smith is a practicing Catholic.I'm going to repeat that, because it automatically nullifies 90% of the attacks on the film. Kevin Smith is a practicing Catholic. He has described the movie as a love letter to faith. Faith. Not even specific Belief, as noted by Rufus, but the Idea of a loving, merciful supreme being.Which is largely why I'm writing this response, not really to disagree but to clarify. It does warn against people who use God for their own purposes, wars, murders, etc. But it also states, perhaps more importantly, that the Bible is not the be-all, end-all guide to Christianity, in that it was written by humans, who are by nature fallible and prone to error. It is by no means an endorsement of literalist, no-room-for-interpretation Biblical orthodoxy. The church is not perfect. God is.This isn't really the focus of the movie, however; it's one of several themes interwoven into the whole. So how is it? It's wonderful, probably Smith's best yet. Less laugh-out-loud funny than his previous efforts, but it more than compensates with original, thought-provoking and more than a little moving scenes that any fans of Joseph Campbell, Neil Gaiman or even Garth Ennis will appreciate. And be warned, jaded Gen-X fans, it WILL make you think about God, in ways you probably hadn't before. And in that rather ambitious goal, Smith succeeds admirably.

It's humor is priceless, the actors are flawless, and its themes attack centuries of Catholic dissension and unrest. What more could the viewer desire?The storyline is twisted yet simple. Bartleby and Loki (Affleck and Damon) are two angels banned from Heaven to Hell by God for centuries. While working in Wisconsin, the mischievous duo discovers a loophole in the system that will allow them to re-enter Heaven without God's permission. The backlash for re-entry would be a blemish to God's infallible reputation as the Supreme Being, and as a result, faith would vanish and society would cease to exist. Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a distant relative of Christ, and two screwball prophets are called upon by Rufus, the unknown 13th apostle, to stop the angels and preserve the world's existence.Admittingly, the film attacks Catholic tradition from all angles. From the boredom of Sunday Mass to God's gender and race, Smith's characters are ruthless in debating the boundaries of Catholic Dogma. And, although some scenes can seem offensive and unjust, all references to Catholicism are intelligent, lighthearted, and comical. Note to the critics The United States Constitution was drafted in the late 1700s after the American Revolution. Its impeccable writers, notably Jefferson, were wise enough to understand and incorporate that times can, and will, change. The document was drafted loosely, preserving general principles and ideas, but most importantly, allowing them to mold and change with society. These changes, as you may recognize, are called Amendments.As a Catholic, I say this with the deepest respect. Society has changed significantly since the Crusades. Perhaps the clergy should take a step outside their doors and look around. Every issue addressed in Smith's Dogma exists and is real. I wasn't the least bit offended by anything noted in the film for two reasons 1.) I have heard them before. 2.) I agree with them.Kevin Smith is an artist and, although is films may be a vehicle to communicate personal ideas, calling his film blasphemous is absurd. It's an intelligent comedy. Enjoy it.

The heroes are a Rufus the 13th Apostle, The Muse, an unknowing descendant of Christ, and two prophets played by our favorite characters - Jay and Silent Bob.  The two Angels are trying to use a loop hole to get back into Heaven and this is the thrust of the movie.

I wondered if they just wanted another remake of Clerks, Mallrats, or Chasing Amy.I happen to think that this IS typical Kevin Smith -- he is always inventive and idealistic; and there is idealism enough here for three movies.His questions regarding religion are ones that theologians have been asking for years; and indeed, most run-of-the mill people ask (or should have asked) themselves.I was amazed at the amount of Biblical knowledge displayed.  The hints about the Apochrypha (the lost books of the Bible)attest to that.Chris Rock as the 13th Disciple is great. His line at the end of the film about Jay and Silent Bob not getting into heaven unless they clean up their language is priceless if you have ever seen his uncensored act on HBO.This is the first movie I have ever liked Salma Hayek in.  She turns in a fine, and strangely believable, performance as the Muse.I do question the casting of Alanis Morissette as God -- I would have gone the same route as Absolutely Fabulous and cast Marianne Faithful as God.  Though Marianne might not be able to pull off the playful God this role requires. Also, since it is God's voice that destroys man (6 Adams before they figured THAT one out) she didn't need to roar -- a whisper would have done it.Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are perfect in their roles as the two fallen angels  Bartleby and Loki.  Their conversation in the garage after their exodus from the train is truly astounding writing.Everyone in the quite full theater the afternoon I saw it laughed at different times in the film.  So different things appealed to different people -- as it should be.This is not a movie that regular church-on-Sunday Catholics should see -- or maybe THEY are the ones who most need to see it.There is much food for thought here -- if only you have an open enough mind to think it.

Offering a unique perspective which only Kevin Smith could probably get away with, I found it to be an instant winner, with one-liners, scenes, and other idealogy which is consistent with the New Jersey stories (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy) being churned out by View Askew.  I wasn't offended by it in the slightest, and when it comes out on home video, I'll definitely be adding this latest installment to my collection.The acting was par for the course as far as the View Askew flicks are concerned, however, the shocker was Alanis Morisette appearing in the role of God (which was pulled off very nicely indeed).Two thumbs up... way up for Dogma.

I love his wacky brand of humor, I love the way he uses a camera, and I love the way he writes. I even love, as I guess some of you do not, his role as Silent Bob who is always teamed with the rude,crude, and in your face Jay. Dogma has a lot of traditional Kevin Smith humor in it, has some very good acting, but overall the movie tries too hard to send a message that really is not all that original or mind numbing. I have read a lot of people on this board who have said Dogma is a great movie which provides food for thought. I beg to differ. Honestly, if you are going to go in the opposite direction of the Catholic Church, or maybe even any religion, you do what Kevin Smith did. Make God a woman, make Jesus black, stress the fact that no religion has it right, and make every one in heaven a little more human (ie fallible) and you have a very predictable script. This was not earth shattering philosophy here and you could go into any college coffee shop and hear about two dozens students debating that very same thing. The plot and the humor was wonderful, but Smith tried to do too much in the realm of explaining religion, the after life, and God's intentions for us all. Almost every scene, even the ones that should have just been left for humor, had a monologue to explain some religious conotation.Chris Rock was used almost solely to explain to us that Jesus was black, that he hated people doing bad things in his name (what a mind blower) and that the bible was politically incorrect. The moments of levity really came from three sources; Jay and Silent Bob, who were wonderfully funny and perfectly out of place in the movie, which I am sure was Smiths intention, Affleck and Damon who were great as Angels, and Alan Rickman as the head Angel, who played the part with humor and also power where you could believe he actually could kick some butt.The movie isn't all that bad. When Dogma is at its best it is simply trying to make the audience laugh instead of beating them over the head with predictable philosophy. It is entertaining, Damon and Affleck do a wonderful job, and it will leave you a bit dissappointed but not disgusted by any means. As for the controversy, there really is none in my mind. I consider myself to be a pretty religious person, a Christian not a Catholic, and I did not come away insulted at all. Even the Jesus Buddy in the begining I thought was hysterical and not blasphemous. I could even see the powers that be, watching from a top some great planet in the universe, getting a big old kick out of a lot that is done in this. The way I figure it, if your beliefs are so shallow that a movie made by a man who has done such films as Mallrats and Chasing Amy threatens your entire religion, maybe it is time for you to find a different one.

I question her choice of films and roles in the recent past.  She should take more roles like this where she can show off her beauty and not be too serious.Kevin Smith falls victim to a temptation that many directors face he casts himself in his own movies.

No, but then again, I'm a pretty jaded 30-ish type.  Is Kevin Smith being sincere when he says that he doesn't understand why religious organizations are protesting the film? I hardly think so.  There are bits in the film that seem specifically designed to tweak sensitive religious types.  That's OK with me -- I agree that God must have a good sense of humor -- but there is no way that Kevin Smith was surprised at the reaction he got.Basically, the film is a Kevin Smith comedy where the contextual background is provided by his views on orthodoxy and religion rather than, say, shopping malls or convenience stores.  I'm willing to wager that not one of the protesters has actually seen this film; hey, if you actually had an informed, rationally thinking brain, why would you waste your time getting hung up on some celluloid?  Wouldn't you notice that such protests do little more than boost box office tallies?  whatever.All that aside, I gave it 7/10 -- strong on the comedy (though with some sophomoric diversions that weren't really necessary) and decent in its critique of institutionalized religion as a force sapping the belief and spirituality out of individualized faith.  But do these things peacefully co-exist in the film?  I'm not so sure.  There is an inherent disconnect when a comedy tackles weighty issues -- you've never really sure if the filmmaker was making a social commentary with comedic elements or a comedy with elements of social commentary.  The result is a somewhat diminished focus and hence power to the finished work.  Still, I'd give it a try -- unless your deepest held beliefs are threatened by a few crass jokes, that is.

I left the theater feeling dissatisfied for several reasons. First off, the acting was not good. In fact, at best it was mostly campy, with exception of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who, for the first time in their acting careers, did an excellent job. The characters themselves were great concepts, but each individual had way too much background info and unbelievable performances (not the good kind). Which leads me to say the movie itself was extremely cluttered. Kevin Smith had way too many creative ideas, which led to everything being crammed together in a few minutes of dialogue. However, I do praise Dogma for its incredible ideas, good cinematography, and some very funny moments. This may seem like a negative review, however it is not. I just wanted to give a slightly negative review to give a different perspective on the Dogma is the best movie ever type reviews I have been reading recently.

The tongue-tied actors, clearly struggling to wrestle with these word jumbles. Direction that clearly discourages both the actor's own choices, and any sense of genuine visual creativity. Relentless pop culture references that are often cheap, trite, and played-out, etc., etc.. It's all true...Then again, it isn't. This guys enthusiasm for what he does is so infectious. I can't help but be moved. 'Dogma' is a fantastic film. Having read the script an eternity ago (as everyone seemingly had) I was entirely impressed.I feared he'd never be able to pull it off to the satisfaction of the snooty, fancypants, 'film-geek' types.But I also felt as though I'd already seen it. I exaggerate not when I say, it's precisely as I imagined it would be. Which was enormously satisfying.Many jokes work, many don't. Each performance has it's great moments and it's awkward, clumsy ones. Working with Bob Yeoman (Drugstore Cowboy, Rushmore), one of the best cinematographers around, it's still mostly dull to look at. It doesn't look as good as most films. For Smith it's a quantum leap forward. And it's still a striking entertainment overall.So determined and heartfelt is this film. So much do I, personally, admire it's sentiment. Embarrassingly, yet sincerely, I am sympathetic to the greater 'View Askew' continuity. I loved this damn movie.Rickman, Rock and, surprisingly, Damon and Affleck are the standout performances. Jason Lee looks like he's having a blast with a character I'd like to have seen more of. Salma Hayek's part is considerably smaller than scripted (and likely filmed) but lively and memorable. George Carlin got the biggest laughs from me. He very well might be the only guy who could elevate the part beyond a hackneyed cliche. Once again more of him would be great.The DVD will, most likey, feature a longer cut. Which I suspect will be an improvement.I am grateful, as it stands, that they mercifully cut the 'Fat Albert' gag. Maybe it played funnier than it read. Probably not (hey, THEY cut it.).No matter, I'm tired and just effectively slammed a film I actually thought was great. Hey, I ain't no film critic.Go figure.Oh, and since nobody else has seemed to point it out) not even the film's detractors), the 'platypus' gag is, I'm pretty sure, more or less, an old Robin Williams joke.

At the theater where I saw this movie, there were picketing protesters calling this film Anti-Catholic and Anti-God. This is religious satire folks. It is supposed to be taken with a grain of salt. Among the complaints against this movie, the main one was the character Bethany, a Catholic who works in an abortion clinic. That was inserted in the film for its absurdity. It depicts a woman who does not know any more where her faith is. She, like so many, attends church out of obligation. She doesn't really know what she believes any more, though. Hence, she feels no guilt in that her Catholic faith and her job conflict. The film was not in any way trying to make a statement about abortion. Some great works of literature are religious satire, and they are still read and studied at high schools and universities without this kind of c**p from ignorant protesters. What I find most ironic is that by protesting this film, many Catholics are proving the point that the movie makes. They are blindly following their church without weighing the facts themselves (i.e. see the movie before you complain about it).Enough on the topic of ignorance, though. This is supposed to be a review.I found Dogma to be outrageously funny and thought provoking. However, it was a bit slow, and I found the last scene depicting God as a ditzy young woman to be pretty stupid. Kevin Smith's script is brilliant, though. As is made evident by Chasing Amy and Clerks, Smith has a flair for combining slapstick comedy with raw philosophical discussion. Mallrats was strictly comedy, but it was quite good as well. The film's funniest moments include Matt Damon's overly dramatic executions of sinners. He has some great one-liners in these scenes, particularly the one in the conference room. Silent Bob and Jay steal the show, though. When they first appeared, the audience in the theater where I saw Dogma erupted in applause. You can't even look at them without laughing. Chris Rock was great as the thirteenth apostle, omitted from the bible because he was black. His comic talent was underused, though. Another character that I wish I had seen more of was Jason Lee as the demon Azrael. Lee stole the show in Mallrats, but his comic ability was missing in this movie. Overall, this film is an outstanding religious satire that raises some very important questions about faith. Do Christians follow God or do they just follow their church? I think that the response from the Catholic church to this movie shows that far too often it is the latter choice. However, Smith himself is Catholic. By making this movie, I believe he is presenting a challenge to his fellow Catholics to do more thinking on their own. I give this movie an 8/10 because of the poor ending. Were it not for that, it would get a 9 or even a 10. However, it's definitely worth seeing whatever your faith. You'll find yourself questioning the strength of your faith and laughing uncontrollably at the same time. 8/10 "},{"Title":"THANK GOD FOR KEVIN SMITH","Date":"17 November 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  As a man who spends as much time contemplating what the words chasing Amy means as I do to be or not to be not all of you will take me seriously, but I loved this film.Alanis Morrisette, an angel herself, is the ideal choice for a human embodiment of god. this film is not sacreligous.

In all fairness, I had fairly high expectations. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as American Beauty, but I was expecting it to be one of my 5 favorite movies of the year. I read the screenplay at least a year ago-maybe more like a year and a half-when it first got put online. I wasn't a big Kevin Smith fan at the time but I needed something to read. It just blew me out of the water, I was laughing my butt off and thinking how brilliant it was. Unfortunately, lots of the scenes I was looking at the most either weren't filmed or ended up on the cutting room floor. I do remember reading that the first cut was around 3 hours, so obviously they had to do a lot of trimming. But man, cutting out the Fat Albert scene? Now THAT scene would have been politically incorrect and blasphemous.Speaking of that, I don't see what all the protesters are so riled up about. I guess I could see Disney being not too amused by the Mooby boardroom scene, but it wasn't any more offensive than Life of Brian. Also, all they're doing is drumming up publicity.Anyway, I've talked to a few people who felt the same as I did- we all read the screenplay and liked the movie OK, but felt let down. We all agreed that the script was brilliant.The special effects were pretty low-rent too- lots of the cool stuff I saw on News Askew didn't even end up in the movie. The angel wings looked good, but the rest...looked too low-budget. I know people are gonna get super-p****d at me for saying that, but I was really surprised at how kind of slapped-together most of it looked.The acting was fine--Chris Rock and Salma Hayak stood out, but I'll see a movie just to see them. Chris Rock, well, it seemed like after his first scene they sort of didn't know what to do with him. Jay and Silent Bob I never was too amused by before, but I loved them in this, especially Bob's facial expressions. Janeane Garafolo was underused. Fiorentino I like, but she got on my nerves at some points.  Alan Rickman was great. George Carlin was also hilarious. Affleck and Damon- they were better than I thought. Ben Affleck is actually more talented than I gave him credit for. IN fact, by the end of the movie he was pretty sexy--wait, what the hell is wrong with me?But anyway, it just didn't come together.When someone asked what I thought of it right after the movie, I thought and finally said, It was just kind of all over the map.The audience was packed full of Kevin Smith fans who lovedJay and Silent Bob, but even the most diehard fans didn't laugh when Bob took care of the Golgotha monster. There was just this kind of awkward silence in the theater. A couple people even booed. No-one clapped after it was over--and I saw some people walking out with the same let down expression as me. I think when you've been looking forward to a movie for over a year, that's bound to happen to a certain extent.Like I said, not a terrible movie by any means. I think it's Smith's best yet, but he could have done better. I wish I'd had more fun seeing this movie than I did--I really wanted to.

Chasing Amy was a very good film, but there were moments when Smith seemed not to be able to decide what to do with the characters. That's not the case here, where a superb and unusual cast (George Carlin playing a Cardinal, Alanis Morrisette as God!!!) played out Smith's vision. Linda Fiorentino continues to prove herself as an actress and she is joined by an excellent supporting and co-starring cast. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are very convincing as the two fallen angels on their quest to return to Heaven.  Chris Rock is hilarious as the forgotten 13th Apostle, and sexy Salma Hayak (seeing her pole dancing was worth the price of admission alone), pulls off the role of the feisty muse, Serendipity.  Kevin Smith film regulars Jay (Jason Mewes) and Smith's own Silent Bob are at their funniest.  Whether it was a conscious decision or not, Smith toned down Jay and Bob a bit from his past movies, making their lines even funnier and more poignant. And Jason Lee was his usual dry, wisecracking self.  I like Smith also uses characters from his past films in minor, sometimes multiple roles. There has been an outcry from some that this film is anti-religion or more precisely anti-Church  To those people I say go see the movie.

The movie may undermine TRADITION, but definitely not faith itself - if anything, the movie helps one to strengthen faith by putting a much-needed humorous and enlightening spin on something that has become too serious and dreary for its own good.

"},{"Title":"Angels of Homesickness","Date":"16 November 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  To cut a long protest short. Kevin Smith' s latest ironic fairy tale is certainly not less anti-christian than Charlton Heston' s characterization as Moses in The Ten Commandments. In fact, Dogma even cites this classic bible epos in one scene and it rightfully does so, because besides of Martin Scorsese' s brave attempt of the adaptation of The last temptation of Christ there aren' t really many movies out there which deal with the bible. When we talk about the bible film genre, we mostly think of bad make-up hiding clicheeic pathos in these 60s Hollywood Reader' s Digest-versions of what is known as the old and new testament. We rarely talk about the ideas behind those cheap F/xs in technicolor, we even more seldom think about the bible of providing us with more than just the well-known adventures of pre-Christ prophets and apostles. So, making a movie about what the bible really is about - ideas, not beliefs, as Dogma states -, is in itself anything else but anti-christian. To claim Kevin Smith' s new movie is even worse, namely anti-catholic, is therefore almost absurd. Especially in times, in which the highest earthly messenger of God' s catholic will does not hesitate to produce a rather boring new age CD in order to proclaim the modern ways of His only church. If the pope isn' t embarrassed enough to speak his prayers over airy synthesizer tunes, why should Kevin Smith not be proud of his most mature piece of work since becoming an independent icon? Are there really still people out there who truly believe that the biblical tales were written by greatgreatgreat...fathers of Bob Woodward with true journalistic instinct and the spirit of the free press? Hopefully, no one believes in such nonsense. On the other hand, there may be a lot of people out there who despite of the Catholic League' s protests strongly believe that Dogma is a witty, clever and in all its absurdity very philosophical thesis on the everlasting battle over mankind between good (God and his angels) and bad (the devil, his demons and all of the fallen ones who have a very hard time getting back to heaven). Smith reduces the epic dimensions of this primary biblical issue to a ensemble movie with a handful of colorful and very lively characters who fit perfectly in both - the cartoonesque world of his previous films and the old testament's accounts of a judging God and his specific personnel. The story is as simple as complex. Because  one of God' s choir boys - Bartleby- once talked God' s sword of anger -Loki - into retreating from unnecessary manslaughter, he and his friend were banned from heaven to live ordinary lives in Wisconsin. Which to them is as near to hell as they can get. On the other hand they can consider themselves very lucky, because other fallen servants of God didn' t meet such an easy fate. Some like the arrogant muse Azrael became real nasty demons, and because that is not the career he had in mind Azrael tries everything to take revenge for his fall from heaven to hell. His latest scheme is to send Loki and Bartleby on a very special quest. Because Bishop Glick will offer a very rare plenary indulgence as a starting point for his campaign Catholicm - Wow!, there may be a slight chance for Loki and Bartleby to get back to heaven as true earthly sinners. The idea is to become human before walking over the Bishop' s church's threshold and thereby being pardoned all their previous sins, including their rebellion against God' s former bloodthirst in raising his strange creation - mankind. But there is a small problem. By doing so they would prove that God is not infallible, and ergo they would negate the whole existence of everything. To prevent them from doing so Metatron, God's rather sarcastic messenger, sends Bethany - a greatgreatgreat...daughter of Jesus Christ out to find them and talk them into the rationale of this theory of all being' s end. Of course, with the final aim of convincing them that it is in everyone' s better interest if they don' t pursue their heavenly quest any further. But the whole thing gets out of control when Bethany drinks one schnapps too much with Bartleby, causing him to finally understand that mankind isn' t worth to be saved from God' s and his homesick angels' rage. And so he starts a suicidal rampage. Somewhere in between Bethany gets to know Rufus, the thirteenth apostle who was taken out of the Bible, because he is black, and Serenpidity, a good muse, who once was responsible for nine of the ten best-selling movies of all times and now earns her living as a bar stripper. She also is saved by Jay and Silent Bob - Kevin Smith himself and his buddy - from Azrael's demonic, but teenage hitmen. That' s in short what its all about. But not really. Because this movie is everything in one - a fantasy road movie parody of those 60s epic bible movies we all know and laugh about today. Smith' s humor, thereby, does not have to be to everybody' s delight. Certainly, his s**tdemon is one of the most disgusting creatures of all times, but then again, it is mainly there for a good laugh - namely when Silent Bob knocks it out with his anti-fart spray (Knocks out every bad smell.). Scenes like this are played joyfully to its cynical climax, e.g when Loki kills every executive of an animation emporium, because they all do not live up to the standard there famous cartoon figure Moopy stands for. He nearly executes the only innocent soul in the room - of course a female executive -, too, because she forgot to say God bless you!, when he sneezed. Well, the depiction of God' s angels as maniac serial killers might be a little bit too disgraceful for some catholics, but then again the Bible knew them,too. It is astonishing how good Smith knows where to find his references and how to establish his completely fictional personnel as true figures of the one and only christian belief system. That alone shows that his movie is not against the christian religion, but for a better understanding of what it is really about. He also masters the complicated F/x-loaden story in perfection, especially by introducing the hockey slayer swinging teenage gang as personified moskitos. Whenever they appear we hear this nerve-wrecking sound of flie-wings. It is that easy to define evil. Only his choice of Alanis Morrisette playing a much to lustful fairy queen in the role of a true Goddess ex machina in the end is kind of questionable. But let' s be not too picky. Dogma is an incredible black humored attempt of bringing its audience back into the mythical world of religion. And a damn entertaining and well-written movie.

This is a good thing!","Date":"16 November 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I enjoyed Dogma quite a bit, so much so that I went back the next night (with different people) to see it again.One of the things that amused me greatly was the constant barrage of almost subliminal religious in-jokes (such as the poster of Enoch the Aardvark; according to some legends, Enoch was a perfect mortal, whom God transformed into the Metatron).Other things, which appeared on the surface to be mere throwaway jokes intended to shock and offend, I found to be rather tongue-in-cheek commentaries on the state of religion.  For example, the Buddy Christ, which apparently offended some people sitting behind me, seemed to me not very far out of keeping with the Catholic Church's relatively recent history of trying to make its services more palatable to the masses (no pun intended), such as changing the language of the Mass from Latin or shifting liturgical music away from that which was written to be beautiful (and often technically demanding) towards songs which, though rather mediocre when compared to their predecessors, could be sung by everyone in the congregation.And while some reviewers found the dialogues boring, I found them a welcome change from the usual Hollywood expectation that we viewers simply want to shut our minds off and watch nonstop action.  It was, ultimately, a movie about ideas, and while this won't appeal to everyone, it certainly appealed to me.Like the Bible, different people will interpret Dogma in different ways. Some will be offended by it, others will find it delightful.  Some will be bored by the dialogues, and some will enjoy the characters' examinations of themselves and the world around them... and perhaps do some thinking of their own.My only real complaint was that it was difficult to understand heavenly/hellish voices, such as the Metatron (when embodied as a column of fire) or Noman.

While the statement is true, it is also a much heavier film than Kevin Smith's previous work, the indie-slacker-famed- New Jersey Trilogy.  The obvious differences were talent, not by those on the screen but by those behind the camera.  This is by far Kevin Smith's best movie, while not his funniest, or most entertaining, it was his most complete project.  It has a story line with the friendly beginning and an end.  The camera work is ever improving, going from stationary to some movement, graduating to movement that's less shaky.   Kevin Smith is one of the funniest writers/producers in the world. I would wait in a line, anywhere, anytime to see one of his films.The on screen talent was amazing.  Chris Rock, The delicious Salma Hayek, reliable Linda Fiorentino, very trendy but good Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, all were outstanding.   But the stars of the film are Jay and Silent Bob. The funniest lines and the best moments all come from these.Though, I still think Clerks is the sharpest of Smith's work, Dogma is excellent and very sharp at moments with its View Askew and politically incorrect humor.  The social satire is served with some serious almost preachy moments.   These moments don't really seem out of place, but some of them don't seem to gel with Jay propositioning Bethany for sex.  Of course, that could just be me.  While, the film didn't reflect my personal religious views, I wasn't offended.

Even still, because of the catholic jokes and the references to Christ and God and so forth, there are disclaimers at the beginning of the film to diffuse any protests and that kind of garbage.But the moment George Carlin appears as a Cardinal, you know, without a doubt that the picture is a comedy.  The funniest things in life are truths anyway.  Besides, after Life of Brian and Last Temptation of Christ, there's not much anyone could do to tick off religious types.After their repeated cameo appearances in Smith's previous films, Jay and Silent Bob finally are two of the central characters. They're heroes. Prophets of God if you can believe it.  The characters are not developed any more than you've known them before, you just get more of what is good about them, and you can't go wrong there.Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play angels who have been exiled from the kingdom of God, and by a decree of Cardinal Glick (Carlin), a loophole has been created that will allow them to return to heaven in spite of God's decree that they are permanently banished.  Because God is infallible, their return would show God to be in error and cancel out all existence as it is known.Linda Fiorentino plays Bethany, who is the one who is chosen to stop the two angels from returning to heaven, and off we go.Chris Rock is his usual explosive self as Rufus, the 13th apostle who was written out of the Bible because he was black.What all this makes for is a hilarious picture that is simply pure entertainment.

I've always enjoyed the mix (I saw Clerks twice on opening day) but I think Dogma is his most mature film yet. It wrestles with questions like What is the difference between faith and religion? How can one be the best human they can be? How could any creature, angel or no, think that Krush Groove would be a more successful film than E.T.?And no, it is not blasphemous. My parents grew up Catholic, and my grandmother still practices, so I know a little bit about Catholicism; true Catholics will understand the value of questioning policies and beliefs, while blind Catholics feel that any questioning of any aspect of Catholicism is disrespectful to the Church. Dogma, ultimately, supports Catholicism, believes in the virgin birth, and believes in the ultimate forgiveness of God. That last part, in particular, was very moving.Some users here have complained that there is too much exposition in Dogma. I think Kevin Smith had to put all of it onscreen because so much of the film's audience would have had no idea what was going on, without the explanations. Let's face it, religious doctrine and history can be incredibly complicated, and the more Smith did to explain it, the better.Overall, there are a few slow spots, and Jason Lee as Azrael is underused, but the screenplay is exuberantly intelligent and thought-provoking. The cast does a great job with their vivid dialogue (it looks like they relish the chance to grapple with big issues not involving a court of law or a world-ending astronomical event), particularly Linda Fiorentino as the world-weary Last Scion and Chris Rock, as Rufus, the forgotten 13th apostle. The casting of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the fallen angels works very well, as their personal history brings a resonance to all of their scenes together. And, of course, Jay and Silent Bob rule. If nothing else, Dogma will give you an excellent reason to always, always, ALWAYS say God bless you when someone sneezes.

Alan Rickman was wonderfully cast as Metatron, and truly gave a convincing performance.  Chris Rock was not at his best, however, and left me wanting more from his character.The ending sequence was way too long and drawn out, and you'd think someone a little less offensive could've played God.

Dogma is one of the most intelligent and daring and it is incredibly funny and very, very entertaining.  Dogma is a triumph and I am glad there are guys like Smith who have the brains to make a film like this.One of the great strenghts of this film is the witty references to 80's films and films in general.  And to quickly rebut what a previous reviewer commented about Smith's small speaking role, yes I agree that he had nothing witty to say in this film but the two lines that he did have were great, especially when he tosses somebody out of the train and he says to a frightened passenger  NO TICKET  as he points out the window.  That is one of the funniest parts of the movie as it parodies or pays homage to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  So to say that his lines are stupid in this film is to not be paying attention to what he is saying and where those lines of dialogue come from.  There are also some great lines about John Hughes' fictitious city of Shermer Illinois and of a debate about what was going to be the bigger film, E.T. or some other small movie that disappeared faster than Tom Selleck's film Ffolks.  Kevin Smith's wit and knowledge of film is on par with Tarantino and Kevin Williams and he is to be applauded for that.This film is very wordy and I can see how some people would think that it takes away from the film's enjoyment, I feel the opposite.  Kevin Smith's strength has been always been his mind and what he writes.  His directing skills are average at best, after all, he has no training with the camera. He only films what he knows how to.  But it is his script that has been the best part of all of his films.  To  say that this film is too wordy is to critisize Smith for doing what he does best, and that is writing witty and smart dialogue for us.  He is obviously very well versed in Catholisism and other religions and he gets it out on paper for all of us to love and laugh at.  I really enjoyed everything that he had to say about religion.  But now to get to what I think the best part of the film is, and that is to look no further than the two male leads.Damon and Affleck are priceless in here.  They work so well together and they feed off of one another.  Affleck has been in all of Smith's films except Clerks and Damon and Smith also go way back as he too had a small cameo in Chasing Amy.  Friendship probably got them to look at the script, but the strength of the script probably got them to do it, and for that I am thankful.  Damon and Affleck work the screen like a pianist works the keys. A perfect example of this (and my favourite part of the script and the film) is when they are at the movie studio and they are patronizing the execs for breaking the ten commandments.  Your eyes are glued to the screen when Damon lays into each and every one of them and even Affleck with his subtle nods and expressions of exasperation are perfect.  I am really pleased that these two played Bartleby and Loki.  Their friendship in real life really helped define their friendship in the film.Dogma is an intelligent film about religion, it is gut bustingly funny in many parts, it has a wonderful cast that play their parts beautifully and it is a Kevin Smith film.  I love it.  This film, while witty and smart, is really one of the funnier films to come out this year.  What's not to like about it?  Thanks Kevin Smith for being loyal to your fans and friends and making this movie and the three others before it.  You really are a genius and I look forward to your next film, whatever that may be.

Throughout the movie, bible passages are quoted and used with all the accuracy of those that are standing outside protesting.All in all, this movie doesn't blaspheme, though it does use foul language (and plenty of it). It definitely does *not* deny God's existence, but more states it as fact. What it does do, which is where most people are probably going to get annoyed, is poke holes in organised religion for religion's sake. The 'going to church just because' brigade are going to be squirming. If you have a spiritual faith that *something* (whatever it may be) is greater than us all, then you'll be fine. If you don't, then you'll be fine. If you're one of those that believe religion should be strictly organised with rules and regulations to follow, and don't dare cross one, then don't bother - you'll only get on your high horse and see how the Catholic church is being 'picked on'.

The acting, for the most part, is quite strong as well.  Though there are too many characters (I could have done both without the demonic Azrael and the muse Serendipity, though it would have denied me an opportunity to see Salma Hayek in a bra and panties, an opportunity always readily welcomed), several of them really connect, particularly Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as the fallen angels willing to wipe out creation to get back into heaven.  The film is also benefited by having the sharpest visual polish of any Kevin Smith project to date (much credit to  Rushmore's Robert Yeoman, who did the cinematography).However, the film had a few major flaws.  For one thing, it's too long.  For another, the dialogue was awfully wordy and too loaded down with the minutae of Catholicism.  At times, it felt less like Smith was telling a story and more like he was trying to impress me with his knowledge of Catholic arcana.  Most fatally of all, the story takes a turn for the serious in the last half hour that it never quite recovers from.  Of course, this is a film about essentially serious subject matter, a subject that people have in fact been willing to kill over throughout the centuries.

Alanis Morissette's walk-on is surprisingly moving (and not a bit blasphemous, in case you were wondering).  Even George Carlin does an admirable job at sticking to his character rather than mocking it.

Could it be that they might have realized their utter folly in choosing to attack a movie that so vividly argues for the existence of God (and makes the idea so absolutely appealing)?

And as opposed to the other three, Dogma has stirred up some contraversy. His other movies (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Clerks) where low budget (With the exception of Mallrats) cult masterpeices that had nothing to do with Catholicism  or any other religion, but his movies where so good that it stirred up its own cult. Dogma was a well awaited for fourth in the series, and I guess you could say that Kevin Smith pushed his luck.On a personal level, as a firm believer in my lord and savior Jesus Christ, and as a big fan of Kevin Smith, I have to say this movie was outstanding! It did not deal with blasphemy, and it did not in the least bit down God. All the rumors about the movie are false. Now I admit that the language is a bit rough, but the movie praises God.  The quarrel with the Church is typical of the Lutheran beginnings - nothing new; buying plenary indulgances or walking through a door to absolve sins is similar.  As long as man has pride and makes decisions in absence of God's will, as we know has happened in the Church, this will be a problem for those of us who want to remain in the Church, but focus on our relationship with God.  This is the crux of Mr. Smith's writing; nothing really new here, but the language is relentless, for those non-swearers so you could have a beef about that. As for all the protesters, go and see the movie, and see for yourself. Stop throwing stones at something you don't know.  And I do not appreciate all the bad rap Dogma is getting.

All of the characters in each of his movies are so vastly different and have such distinct traits it's hard not to be amused.  The other thing that impresses me constantly about Smith's films is the dialogue.  Vulgar?  Yes.  Somewhat juvenile at times?  Yes.  Clever? Yes.  People praise Quentin Tarantino and Robert Altman also for creating great characters and witty dialogue.  If you are one of those people, you will be blown away by Dogma.

I understood Smith's ambition to go beyond his Jersey Trilogy fanboy nametag. I tried to swallow the whole Alanis thing, though I would never understand it. I did my best to look past Hayek's terrible performance.  She basically ruined every scene she was in.  Looks like she'll never be able to succeed past her stereotypical Mexican vixen roles.  Stick to Desperado, Salma.  There are questionable casting choices, including wasting Jason Lee on a one-dimensional villain, but Chris Rock has won over my skepticism. He pulls in the laughs, and surprisingly kept the grating aspect of himself to a minimum.  Rickman was amusing, though a little pasty-faced.  Fiorentino, Damon and Affleck turn out appreciable performances, as to be expected.    On to Smith's directing  He really shouldn't.  I'm a huge fan of his writing, but he should at least let someone else coordinate any sort of action sequence. The look of the film isn't adequate for a piece this ambitious.   You won't see the same wit,or the play on pop culture that was so prevalent in his Trilogy, but you'll see what has become of the vision he had before Clerks.  He put a lot thought into this, though it definitely doesn't have the heart that I saw in Chasing Amy.  But it's made an impact on me.  It hasn't changed what I think, but perhaps, how I think.

It has a great deal of fun at the expense of Holy Mother Church, and the arcana of Church law and dogma.  It's intelligent (dick and fart jokes aside), witty, and very well acted.At one point in the movie, I was struck to be watching two such Ur-Gen-Xers as Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, as fallen angels, discussing the nature of faith and free will in the context of Christian faith.  Affleck, as Bartleby, laments that God has not given angels the same gift of free will that (s)he has given man, and that many humans are so ungrateful for this richest of gifts that they do not even acknowledge the donor.  In another scene, Salma Hayek, as a stripper-muse, instructs us that It is not as important what we believe in, as that we believe in something.  I began to feel that this was a spiritually enlightened movie.But in the end, the film disappoints, as screenwriter/director Kevin Smith cops out.  Having pointed out the absurdity of doctrines propounded by twenty centuries of power-hungry, sexually frustrated old men, Smith and most of his ethereal cast retreat, physically or figuratively, into the cold, imprisoning womb of Holy Mother the Church.  It's obvious to me that the Catholic League protesters have not seen this film; if they had, they would be celebrating it as a paean to the Catholic faith rather than an outrage.  In my view, it's nothing more than a tease - a very funny tease, but a tease nonetheless. "},{"Title":"Offensive, yes.

However, there IS hypocrisy in movie critic circles, a group that can trash an equally (if not more) funny film Very Bad Things for containing some of the same caliber of disturbing images and adult themes as Dogma.  I suppose Very Bad Things should have tried taking some shots at Catholicism.In the first five minutes of Dogma, we see the new Jesus from the marketing dept. of the Catholic church.  This Jesus is a hip and happy Jesus, giving a wink and a thumbs up type expression. It will replace the morbid image of Jesus suffering on the cross.  Now that's not offensive to any Christian, right? Yeah, right.It would be a mistake to say this movie is not offensive to Catholics.  Simply put, this film smacks of the hollywood power structure's casual approval in the debasement of catholicism and other religions. I've seen it before not too long ago in the movie Vampires, albeit in that film the script was nowhere as funny as with Dogma (and obviously had a different subject matter.) Having said that, this movie *is* funny and does about everything imaginable to remind the viewer (especially the sensitive one) that this is just a movie and not to be taken seriously.  It's almost as if the makers of the film come out and say we've found some really funny concepts for a script, it  will make you laugh at the expense of the Catholic church and Christianity in general, but don't let that bother you, we really don't intend it to offend you.But beyond this whole catholic bashing issue there is a funny story and some excellent performances, particularly by Alan Rickman who plays the angel Metatron.  Chris Rock does his usual funny stuff and really adds a nice edge to the material.  Matt Damon is very good (as always.)

The dialogue is well written, but not always delivered very well.  However, the conversations between the characters really make you think about your own faith and what you would do in their situation.

It is simply an attempt to restate for a modern youthful audience classic inquiries into the nature of faith, questions that have occupied the minds of such luminaries as Augustine, Abelard, and Luther. Sure, the Catholic Church is highly visible in this film, which is to be expected, since it is one of the two oldest Christian denominations and by far the one with the most embellished traditions, laws, and physical presence in the US. The worst damage this film does to Christendom is to gently poke a little fun at it. Even militant atheist George Carlin holds back in his role as a cardinal. Comedian Don Novello's Father Guido Sarducci character packs a lot more venom.While a serious comedy with a theological theme is certainly welcome, DOGMA does have some prominent shortcomings. First, it runs too long and moves too slowly. Second, the direction and editing of the action scenes is very poor. Third, the cast is too uneven (Alanis Morrisette as a mute God? Puhleese). Fourth, production values are below average. And finally, the script lacks focus. I think a much more effective (if less remunerative) film could have been made by having the three leads, Damon, Affleck, and Fiorentino, sitting around and having a late-night bull session, a la MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.Kevin Smith has a lot to offer, but he is not talented enough for enfant terrible status and is not seasoned enough to draw elegant humorous devices from such rich source material. My bet is that 20 years hence he will look back on this film with some embarrassment. I hope he gets a chance to re-explore this theme in his midlife.

It is extremely funny in the same vein as his previous films, and it does a rather good job discussing the confused state of Christianity today. I believe he comes up with a very good synopsis of the situation. The film, though, has some problems. The clashing of serious religious issues with both dirty, sometimes tasteless jokes and hardcore violence was severely jarring. Another problem is that the antagonists and their situation are more interesting than the protagonists. We've seen a lot of stories about people who had to rely in their faith as they are simultaneously losing it. Harvey Keitel's role in From Dusk Till Dawn, for example, was like this. There are also too many protagonists. What the heck did they even need Selma Hayek in the movie for? She plays a Muse, a deity which isn't even Christian. Her character accomplishes little in the way of plot. The angels were much more interesting to me, and the film cuts away from them right when Bartleby, played by Affleck, and Loki, Matt Damon, both have vital character changes. They basically switch personalities, and the movie actually cuts to a standard scene where Linda Fiorentino questions her abilities (the scene reminded me of the one in the Muppet Movie where Kermit the Frog went off from the other Muppets to ask himself if what he was doing was right). Also, the ending goes on for way too long, with six different characters each having their own reconciliation with God (who actually contributes to the soundtrack). It goes on for so long, Smith had Jay and Silent Bob do something funny to keep the audience from growing restless. The biggest problem the movie has, though, is the abundance of explanation. Smith introduces so many different bits of Christian politics and beliefs that nearly a quarter of the entire film consists of characters explaining these things. I can appreciate the amount of detail that Smith included, but it detracts a bit from the film.Although I have a lot of complaints, the film did succeed in passing on its point, and it especially succeeds in being hilarious. If you did like his previous efforts, you will like this. And if you like Jay and Silent Bob, this is the film out of Smith's four that they figure the most prominently. There was a little disappointment in that Silent Bob did not give us any nugget of wisdom as he does in Clerks and Chasing Amy (and Mallrats, if you count the blurb from The Empire Strikes Back).

Clerks and Chasing Amy are two of the best films of the nineties, and Mallrats is easily one of the funniest. But with his newest effort, Smith has created a flawed film that while it was enjoyable on one level, it lacked severely in others.Dogma is one of the most intelligent screenplays ever written, and easily the best ever written dealing with the Catholic Faith (with apologies to Paul Schrader).  An Oscar nomination is due to Smith for this work, and that, I believe, cannot be disputed. The film is well-structured, witty, but most importantly is was obviously written with a love and respect for his faith.  But as for Smith's ability as a director, I believe that is a different subject altogether.  Even if the dialogue is extraordinarily well-written, most viewers cannot sit through a film where they sit through over-the-shoulder shots again and again while two characters debate their faith.  It, quite frankly, gets a little boring.True, some blame is due to the actors, who may be in over their heads delivering this weighty dialogue.  In some scenes between both Linda Fiorentino and Alan Rickman, and Fiorentino and Chris Rock, Fiorentino seems to bring the scene down.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck showed their incredibly chemistry on screen, and Affleck is especially fun to watch as the angel who is so in touch with God's relationship with humans that he becomes jealous of that relationship.  He is the brightest star in an amazing cast, and Smith himself ranks a close second.  His facial expressions are tremendous, and his few lines are delivered with an honesty and conviction that is rare for any actor.  Jason Lee is another stand out as Azrael, the one true villain in the story.  Whenever these three actors were involved in a scene, the movie was intensely enjoyable.I did enjoy the movie however, and laughed very hard some scenes,  although not as often as in Smith's previous films.

No pentagrams on our family dinner table; there is honest, open discussion and topics in this movie are not picketed outside our house.Beyond the controversy stirred up outside the theater lies a roaringly funny movie inside. Smith is able to put together an interesting story line full of humorous lines as well as some developmental dialogue to keep the story moving along. On a couple of occasions the feel got a bit preachy (particularly during the train scene) and a few minutes probably could have been shaved off the final running time, but all in all, it's a good ride.Fiorentino gives a fine performance as a woman confused by her faith and even further confused by the mission her faith sends her on. Damon and Affleck did a bang-up job as the renegade angels; they were a welcome presence on the screen. Jason Mewes takes the cake for inducing humor, mainly because his toilet talk is a real contrast to much of what is spoken here. Silent Bob is nearly as funny with his facial expressions.It was nice to see Jeff Anderson back on the big screen, but he barely opened his mouth -- a travesty for Randal Graves' fans. Jason Lee also (surprisingly) suffered from an underwritten part, but he did well with the little time he had. George Carlin and Bud Cort also took advantage of their small roles. And Alanis wasn't bad.Nothing spectacular about the filming of this one, but as always, it's the characters that make Kevin Smith's movies sing. Fearing letdown on my way in, I left the theater thinking that a.) what in the world was there to protest?; b.) the movie only dragged twice, which wasn't bad for a movie running 125 minutes; c.) Smith did a great job piecing together a complex story line while (here's the key part) keeping the shock value limited to Jason Mewes' mouth. And how surprising is it to hear Jay talk about getting' with the women?Shame on Miramax for cowering away from such a great film. I hope Lions Gate sees a decent return on this, and I hope the Weinsteins continue to wimp out on good films so we no longer have to endure their Oscar campaigning.

But somehow miracles happen, and everything crummy and amateurish about Smith's first three features has been transubstantiated into a movie of shocking emotional force.Somewhere, a genius synapse fired in Smith's thick head the connection of two of his obsessions, the hoky, convoluted mythology of George Lucas and the hoky, convoluted mythology of Saint Paul. Put the two together and you have a fiendishly inventive giant comic strip in which abstract issues of faith are rendered with the matter-of-fact hyperbole of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smith assembles a band of ne'er-do-wells on a superheroish mission to stop two renegade angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from proving God fallible and negating existence. The almost Jesuitical tangles of theology debated by the characters, put in the context of cheerfully cloddish action sequences and mock heroics, suggests Smith smoked a bowl, watched THE MILKY WAY and STAR WARS, and woke up confused as to which was which. For my money, though, it all works--yes, including the talky diatribes on points of Church arcana, and yes, including the protracted climax that stretches even Marvel Comics logic to the breaking point. (One exception a scatological monster scene that revives everything that sucks about Kevin Smith. Oh, and one more the grating presence of Smith himself in his own movie.) Smith has the effrontery to suggest that questions of belief and ethics are both an essential part of everyday life, and as jumbo-sized as the shaggy plot of a big action movie. And despite his cutesy disclaimer, a lot of Smith's jokes have bite. As I walked out of this movie--quite moved, I have to say--I felt suddenly filled with hope.

There was way too much of the prophets for my taste, but I understand they are stock Kevin Smith characters (and, indeed one of them is played by the director himself).I'm an agnostic so the only thing I found offensive was the foul demon and too much blood in two scenes.   For people who bother to pay attention to the movie (rather than the boycott without thinking mentality), most of the anti-relgious comments are about how people abuse religion.I have rarely seen theological discussions in movies (outside of costume epics like A Man for All Seasons), and they abound in this one.

What started out with some extremely funny segments in Clerks and Mallrats.  Then Smith made a very true and honest film, Chasing Amy which was also hilarious but, as far as film wise, was much better than Clerks and Mallrats.  Now Smith gives us a true religious-comedy epic, Dogma.  And even with the big leap into special effects, big budget, and extremely high Catholic controversy, Kevin Smith still succeeds.Lots of fans have read the script which has been floating around the internet for a good two years now.  And quite a bit has changed with some of the scenes and dialogue but the plot stays very true to the draft we have read.  Our heros, Jay and Silent Bob, join Bethany and Rufus (Linda Fiorentino and Chris Rock) to stop renegade angels Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from getting looped back into heaven.  And there are other performers we have seen in past Kevin Smith films returning here, Jason Lee, Jeff Anderson and Ethan Surplee in a very unrecognizable role found here.  Oh, and lets not forget George Carlin and his Catholicism WOW! campaign at the beginning of the film.Like Chasing Amy, this is another very true film.  It's hilarious and often thought-provoking.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really prove themselves as outstanding actors here, we maybe used to seeing Matt Damon play very similar performances in Good Will Hunting and Rounders but we see a very more agressive and, yes, badass side to him here.  There scenes keep your attention throughout and when they aren't on camera Chris Rock and Alan Rickman do an excellent job.  But the best performances in the film are definatly Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith as always).  Every scene they are in they shine better than everyone else.  Silent Bob, although with only two lines, is just funny to watch his facial expresions and body language while Jay is just at his best and finest.However there are some problems with the film though.  Linda Fiorentino is absolutly one of the most boring characters ever in this film.  She plays Bethany so dull and even in important parts of the script between her and Metatron (Alan Rickman) she literally brings you to sleep.  The film could have been a tad bit shorter too since some parts really felt like they were dragging on for too long.  But as far as complaints go, those are really the only ones I have.Believe me though, this is a great film to see.  Four hours after seeing the first showing I wanted to go to a later showing the same day already.  Unfortunatly all the later showings sold out but I'm already looking forward to seeing it again.  Kevin Smith is going beyond a cult classic and to the realm of a true film icon.  An outstanding followup to Chasing Amy. "},{"Title":"Finally!

They were all pretty fleshed out, and played to perfectionBen Affleck just ruled..I couldn't believe it..the guy came, saw, and went crazy with his part, and ruled. There is so much to this film. The little tidbits we get through out the film are fun, and give it even more flavour. The only true problem I had was with Jason Lee, who's character really wasn't anything but a snappy dressed, over confident demon, and it didn't work for me. I am planning to see the film again. The plot I won't go into, but it involves a lot of scheming and planning by its main characters. Roger Ebert once said in a review for Jackie BrownI could watch these characters scheme and plan for hours. That's how Dogma is.

It was still very obviously a View Askew movie, but its complex (but clear) story and sense of direction was something that took me by surprise when I read the script.  It was a nice surprise, though, because the story was so goodTwo fallen angels may unwittingly destroy the world by going against God's will and re-entering heaven thereby negating existence, which is wholly based upon the idea that God is infallible.

Great performances, great story and great special effects.

That movie was pure trash, and its sequel (why did I even watch the sequel?) was worse.Kevin Smith directed, wrote and acted in this movie, and for that I salute him. Salma Hayek is better than her usual roles. In this movie she plays a smart muse, while in Wild Wild West, she was a dumb muse (by the way, in WWW her talent was completely wasted). Jason Lee (Azriel-the devil), George Carlin (Cardinal Glick), Jason Mewes (non-stop talking Jay) and Chris Rock (Rufus-the 13th apostle) are doing great jobs and contribute enormously to the movie. Linda Fiorentino is perfect as the world's saviour and Alan Rickman (Metatron) gives a marvelous performance as a cynical angel (his scene concerning tequila drinking-and then spewing it back, and the extremely funny pants-down scene are very original). Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have lots of chemistry (that's not a surprise, we know how well they got along in Good Will Hunting) and are competent as outcast angels Bartleby and Loki. But the real gem of this movie is Alanis Morissette. Though she does not say anything, her screen presence is overwhelming.

However, this loophole will prove G-d wrong and thereby negate all existence. Alan Rickman (Metatron) is sent to Earth to ask Linda Fiorentino (Bethany), the last known descendant of Jesus, to stop them and save the world. In her travels she meets up with two prophets, Jason Mewes (Jay) and Kevin Smith (Silent Bob), two minor characters from Smith's `Chasing Amy', and Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th apostle, who aid her in carrying out her mission. Salma Hayek also has a supporting role as Serendipity, the muse, who adds lots of beauty as she helps the group toward their goal. Affleck and Damon are their usual charming selves. Fiorentino, so perfect in `The Last Seduction', adds another important role to her gallery of portrayals. Chris Rock is hysterical with his great comic timing. Even Alanis Morrisette has a sweet cameo.This plot summary cannot begin to describe Smith's genius at giving his characters witty and wise dialogue to speak. Smith's musings on the absurdity of organized religion as juxtaposed to his belief in a deity and its ultimate good.

At the same time, I think somehow Kevin Smith knew this response was coming, and courted it. Folks, this is no work of brilliance - it's a simple comedy with a very religious bent.

With directing and writing credits on Clerks, Mallrats, and Chasing Amy, you KNOW this is going to be funny.

A very funny film, it appeared to be more appreciated by the older, 'second showing' crowd at the Toronto International Film Festival than by the 20-something opening night bunch.  One wonders if they better recognized the multiple movie and several television references that pepper the film.  As testimony to the work of young director/writer Kevin Smith--or perhaps to the religious controversy and Catholic League opposition engendered by this film--it was sold out on both occasions.  Mr. Smith, very humorous and personable, was on hand to deftly handle questions.  In spite of his avowals of this film being a testimony to his Catholic faith, it has received a well-deserved R rating (for strong language including sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug content).  Obscenities are less gratuitous than in his previous Chasing Amy, and Jay's (Jason Mewes) final remarks to God (Alanis Morissette) are obscenely hilarious.  The highlight was another stellar performance from Alan Rickman, as Metatron, the Voice of God (I am the Metatron, herald of the Almighty, and Voice of the One True God) whose skill is truly remarkable in illuminating the occasionally otherwise tedious exposition required to advance the plot. He inspires with touching paternal tenderness as Bethany's mentor--walking on water the while--and fully redeems the ludicrous display of his Ken-doll physiology and angelic Tequila quaffing earlier in the film. Smith himself, as Silent Bob, has a larger role than in his previous films, dispatching the Golgothan and retrieving the body of the slain Bethany (Fiorentino).  He and the Good Will Hunting boys--Matt Damon and Ben Affleck--plus the rest of the locker room crew seem at times to be in a very different movie than are Rickman and Fiorentino.  But, in the last analysis, it is an extremely funny good time to be had, with special mention of the very effective use of music in this film.

This review is based on the screenplay on the Internet. If it's any indication of what the film will be like, then it's already one of my favorite films. I can't really review it without talking about the current controversy surrounding the Catholics' and their negative attitude towards the film. It is not blasphemy, to begin with. Certain obstacles in the story are created by certain Catholic rules, suggesting that they are wrong (which is probably what the Catholics are crying about). It doesn't deny, question, or show any disrespect to Jesus or God. It does, however, speculate on the holes in the Bible, the things that are left out, making humor out of these left-out fictionalized details. If one feels that making jokes about one's religion is disrespectful, then let me remind you that the oldest rule of comedy is that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. Kevin Smith has called this movie his love letter to his faith. In the script, he treats the subject matter like it's an old friend. I don't know to many old friends that I can't joke around with as a way of expressing love and friendship. Kevin, if you read this, I respect your love of your religion, and know that it has made me really think about mine for the first time in years (and laugh at the same time). I believe that God, male or female, has to have a sense of humor to put up with us for as long as he/she has, and will remember this love letter when your time comes. Peace be with you, my friend.

The movie (much of which has a ramshackle roadshow kind of feel) evidences both Smith's often childishly scatological, combative approach to things and a strangely noble attempt to grapple with the status and relevance of Catholicism - it's silly and profound, often simultaneously, as if embarrassed by its flirting with significance when the tone takes on some gravity, it's usually instantly undermined (Mass genocide's the most exhausting activity one can engage in,	 says Angel Of Death Matt Damon, next to soccer) and whatever squirming the faithful might initially feel (the first scene with the Buddy Jesus doesn't make for the strongest beginning) should surely find some release in the faith-friendly outcome. Still, the movie is never on the same celestial plane as dullness - for instance, the concept of a muse that inspires Hollywood, around which Albert Brooks belabored an entire recent movie, is squeezed dry here in about fifteen seconds.

I was there to see Kevin Smith's new movie and prepared to wait for eleven hours.  I did.  There were not any tickets left, so I was waiting for Rush tickets (that means if someone doesn't show up or if there's a free seat, then they let people in.) I had a good day anyway meeting celebs.  I anticipated not that much, and was happy that the film didn't totally suck.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are great as two renegade angels named Loki and Bartleby, trying to get back into Heaven.  They find a loophole in the bible, and make there way to New Jersey to walk through the arches of a Catholic church.  Trying to stop them are Silent Bob, Jay and newcomer, Linda Fiorentino as Bethany.  Chris Rock and Salma Hayek are also in it, as the thirteenth apostle, and the muse respectively.  Jason Lee returns as a servant to the devil.  His performance is priceless, and he said to me that he only made scale!!!  There's not a funnier line in the film, then Lee stating,there isn't a greater sin than central air. Alan Rickman is a very witty voice of god. All the acting was superb and there's even a bit part with Janeane Garofalo.  Good movie all in all, but I'm still absorbing it. A criticism of mine is that there was way too much cut from the final print and it was obvious. Smith fans will like it, and I can see how all the religious freaks would dissapprove of the flick.  Jesus was black, so why are they getting their panties in a bunch over that.  Oh, and the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie is hysterical!

I am a big fan of Kevin Smith and have to say that I was thrilled to find the screenplay on the Internet. Before I continue, I should point out that I am not a follower of any religion. Therefore much of my experience with religion and Catholicism is based upon what I see, read or hear from others more enlightened to the church and it's many ways. Leaving religion aside, if this film is half as good on screen as it was to read, then I think we are all in for a treat. As always, the dialogue is crisp, very funny at times and honest. Having seen the cast made me even more excited to see the final product. Jason Lee can do no wrong in my eyes and the same can be said for the rest of the cast. It is a great blend of talent and I hope it works, as I'm sure it will. I am surprised by the controversy surrounding this film. I have never had religion as a major part of my life and have to say that I am not a strong believer in the presence of God or the credibility of the Bible, but Dogma opened my eyes. I really don't see it as offensive to the church or religion in any way, shape or form. If anything, this movie has pushed me that much closer to believing that there is a God... be it a man or Alanis Morisette.So, all I can say is sit back and enjoy what should be a very good film and stop worrying about it being offensive. It is, after all, just a movie. If you don't like what it says, then don't listen... let the rest of us enjoy and judge for ourselves.

After reading it, all I can honestly say is that Kevin Smith has done it again.  A lot of people have come out and complained that its a Bible Epic, but you have to remember, this is Kevin Smith.  To him, a bible epic is nothing but another funny as hell comedy with some supernatural cr** involving religion thrown in.  Sure, its all about two angels and their screwed up plot, but those angels are also played by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck which just goes to show you how serious its not.  Also, in the position of evil is Jason Lee.  You know, Broadie Bruce of Mallrats?  The guy who stuck his hands down his pants to get back at someone?

I just finished reading the script to Dogma and I have to say, as a Catholic, I found the script very entertaining to read and it did not contain an anti-christ message like many protesters are claiming it to be. I was actually amazed by what I read and wondered how in the world Hollywood is going to put all of this activity into a full-length feature film. I can't wait for it's release in November. If any film is considered a milestone or a controversial barrier-breaker, it's going to be Dogma by far. It has already steamed up heavy controversy and protest by members of the Catholic faith 6 months before it's release. I can't imagine what will happen in November when it's shown to the entire nation. The plot, however, is done in good taste along with the character structure. It's simply a religious satire. In my opinion, basic catholics (the ones who went to catholic schools) will enjoy it the most because it pokes fun at the loopholes in organized religion that every person questions but sometimes never speaks or will never admit to questioning because of fear of eternal damnation or lack of faith. Any fan of Kevin Smith's previous films will enjoy this gem! The script has a theological message to it  We Are All One! We Must Do Good! And We Are Christians, not catholic or protestant or baptists, Christians! If everything I have read in the script is left in the film come November, then there will be protests until the second coming of the Lord I can assure you. Despite it's bad rep, I found the script enjoyable to read and I have to confess to literally laughing out loud while reading some parts of it. I hope there is no deletion of any scenes or dialogue in the script. All of it is clever, original, and unbelievable. All we can do now is wait......

I should read the script again, but I didn't find myself offended because of these anti-catholic remarks, which I never really saw. This film NEEDS to be released.

Why is it that almost anything in the world is open for critisism and poking fun at yet religion and moreso Catholisism is the Holy Grail and people get offended and try to ban the film because it doesn't conform to what YOU believe is right.  Whatever happened to free speech?  Is it that they are afraid that Catholics are going to watch this film and change their minds and become atheists?  Is it because they don't have a sense of humour?  Isit because religion has just a little too much power?  And further more, is it because Catholisism has just a wee bit too much power.  If you look at life, and you subscribe to the theory that everything you see is God's creation, then you have assume that God has a sense of humour, and if that is true He would be looking down on all the uptight Catholics and religious types and laughing His butt off when it comes to all the controversy that has been generated by this film.  Really, what is it that is so offensive about a film that pokes fun at religion?  I am like the previous reviewer and have not seen the film, but I have read it, and you know what?  I think it is hysterical.  A complete laugh riot.  And here's the kicker.  I believe in God, I've read the Bible cover to cover twice and I do fear the Almighty. But does that mean that everything that is ever said about Him ( or Her in this case) has to be  Praise the Almighty, God you are king and blah balh blah?   Do religious fanatics not realize that many people have a problem with organized religion and that a film like this is really quite funny and not only acceptable but appropriate?  The people that critisize this film are the same people that say Santa Clause is a bad influence on children. My Gosh, have a sense of humour.Dogma made me laugh.  I read the script in one afternoon and when Rufus shows up I laughed so hard that I almost choked on my Diet Coke that I was sipping on at the time.  The script is so visually perceptive that I could see everything that is happening.  And not only is the film hilarious, but it is smart.  It is written by a guy ( Smith ) that obviously has issues about religion but he respects it in some way, perhaps like me.  But he has told a story about normal people and people that we will probably never meet in our life time.  It is the story of a girl that is down on her luck and she questions God and His/Her intentions towards her ( haven't we all done that? ).  It also has two angels in it that have fallen out of God's grace by basically doing what they thought was right and then finding out that they misinterpreted what God wanted.  And then it of course has Jay and Silent Bob.  They are still two idiots that save the day here.  And so what the film does is pokes fun at religion, but if you can read, not just what you want to see but everything that is in the script, then you will see that this film has a lot more to say about Catholisism and religion than just bad stuff.  There are a lot of positive comments in the script, but people that consider religion to be off limits when it comes to satire are too blind to see those comments.  All they want to see is the stuff that seems to say religion is wrong.  And you know what, it doesn't say that.  Open your eyes.Most people that I know are confused about religion.  All we have to go on is what is written in a book.  That's it.  There is no concrete proof that anything written in the Bible is real.  But what everyone goes on is faith. Faith says Jesus died for our sins.  Faith says that the ten commandments were written.  Faith says that Moses parted the red sea.  There are no fossils to say that Noah really landed on top of that mountain.  There is no museum with irrefutable proof that says God was alive at one point, in the flesh that is.  So if all that religion has going for it is faith, then why is it afraid when someone makes something that goes against that faith? If you are as strong as your religion makes you out to be, then you really should have nothing to worry about.  Why not just quit your bitching and go see this movie for what it is?  And that is a funny look at someone's educated satirical look at one part of religion.  Just relax.  Don't be so damn defensive.  To me, that shows a lack of your own faith.  Kind of contradicts your whole point now, doesn't it?If you want to read this script, go to script-o-rama.com  You will find the script there.

They struggle to show some dry comic wit with what could be every day conversations, or at least people at work fooling with each other.These fooling gibes work with friends, because friends are already doing something they like to do, or have a rapport.We've probably all seen friends who had no natural writing talent, expound upon ideas just like this. Savvy folks see through it.The problem is threefold with this movie.First, the initial idea. It's a drawing board failure. It's the idea that can be mildly humorous for five seconds when two friends come up with the idea. It doesn't translate well into performance, as we see here.Second, the writing just doesn't inspire. It tries to be too mundane, and induce laughter with the ordinary. Some writers can do this. We don't have such writers for this script.Third, you need some raw comic talent in performers. These look like acting school students, trying to be funny. They just don't have it.And yet, while it has no value as comedy, it appears there is a fan club. The obvious conclusion is that this hits the ordinary talentless person in their gut, and lets such a person be part of an ordinary world.So I attribute the success to being ordinary, something that the high school dropouts, painters, roofers, rich kids with cameras, and pot heads can relate to, something that tells them it is okay to be without talent.Obviously, this isn't a funny movie, but the heart is in the right place.

The upshot of it is that it fails rather spectacularly.The film centres around several characters as they react in their world and try to come to terms with whatever it is their aims are, no matter how feeble. One character just wants to live normally, one angel persists on giving long and confusing speeches in a monotone voice about goals and human kind, two characters that are also angels want to get back into heaven and another two human characters just want to get laid &#150; Wings of Desire this is not. Given the fact I don't follow a religion of any kind, I didn't find the Christianity bashing that offensive but another thing I didn't find it was funny. If having Chris Rock replying Yeah, nigga' owes me twenty bucks. to whether or not he knows God is funny to you then by all means tune in. Dogma also has several occurrences where it is trying to be offensive without reason to. This is evident when Jesus is referred to as actually being black and female, church is boring and the emblem of Jesus being crucified on the cross is 'updated' with Jesus winking and giving the thumbs up sign.Here is why the film is so very inconsistent. The two antagonists of the film are Bartleby and Loki (Affleck and Damon) and oddly enough, they're the most interesting but mostly because they actually do stuff and say funny things; including their own take on how people who break the Ten Commandments should be punished. Having these two angels banished from heaven and attempting to get back in is far more interesting than hanging around with Bethany Sloane (Fiorentino) and her monotone angel friend Metatron (Rickman) who pops up just when you don't want him to ready to give another flat yet encouraging-to-the-hero speech. I feel the reason for this is because not only are the two the better actors in the film but it also feels like they have a goal; something to do whereas Bethany and the gang are just running around trying to find them.Another thing the film lacks in the consistency department is the characters reactions. No matter how bizarre or unreal the situations get, the reactions and faces will always be the same, stone-like expressions. Someone, literally, drops out of the sky (in the worst character introduction of all-time), a 'crap' monster comes out of the toilet and throws human waste around the place, angels appear then transport them across space and time to another location in a flash and yet the characters treat it all like it happens all the time. Inconsistency reigns down again when God is established as a female yet Rufus (Rock) refers to Her as 'He' about five minutes later on board a train and the angels of Loki and Bartleby get their arses kicked by the two stoners Jay and Silent Bob yet are these invincible, all powerful and immortal beings later on in the film which acted as a very drab way of getting the film to its climax.Dogma is a very poorly thought out film that relies on humour that is either of the slapstick or toilet variety and also borrows too many one liners and spoofs from other well known films from the past two decades to enjoy &#150; at times it does feel like a 'Scary Movie'. Jay (Mewes) is as clueless at the end of this film as we are; the only gyp being that we don't get a kiss from Alanis Morissette for our troubles.

Personally, I think the impact of certain revelations (e.g. a thirteenth apostle was left out of the Bible for being black) are lessened by the opening disclaimer stating the movie shouldn't be taken seriously. I followed that advice, and liked the movie.So, what's this all about? There are two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) who have been exiled from Heaven (They were sent to Hell? Worse. Wisconsin). After thousands of years, they learn there might be a way to return home if they enter a church in New Jersey, all their sins will be canceled, allowing them to get back to Paradise. Naturally, there's a catch should they succeed, all existence will be wiped out. And with God mysteriously absent, someone else has to stop them. Enter Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino), a woman who has lost her faith and is given the vital mission by another angel, Metatron (Alan Rickman). Of course, given she's only human, she'll receive some help, in the shape of Rufus (Chris Rock), the aforementioned thirteenth apostle, the muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek) and two prophets... Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith)! With allies like these, how can she possibly fail? As always with Smith, much of the pleasure derives from the writing the witty, often potty-mouthed dialogue is the usual aural joy. He mocks everything and everyone, particularly John Hughes (apparently, Home Alone became successful because some nut sold his soul to Satan), without ever making it feel offensive.So why isn't Dogma as hilarious as Clerks? Well, the answer lies in the cast while Affleck and Damon are fun as the angels, Fiorentino is a convincing lead, and Jay & Silent Bob are scene-stealing alongside Rock, other actors aren't as funny. In particular, Jason Lee, otherwise terrific, doesn't get a chance to really shine as demon Azrael, and Rickman's performance is a bit too British to fit in Smith's crazy View Askewniverse.Still, if you're looking for a good laugh, Dogma is recommended. Smith has done better, but the movie is very enjoyable anyway. If not taken seriously, it might even please devout Catholics. Who knows?

However, they are unwitting pawns in a plot by a sneaky demon called Azrael to destroy mankind, having first distracted God's attention. Bethany is a lapsed Catholic who turns out to be a blood descendant of Christ, and is recruited by God's staff to prevent the apocalypse, along with the help of an unknown Black Apostle, a Muse who works as an erotic dancer and a couple of stoners called Jay and Silent Bob. Can the forces of Heaven overcome this terrible threat ?Dogma is a fabulous movie; hilarious, thought-provoking, very well acted and terrific fun throughout - what other film juxtaposes scenes of profound metaphysical argument on the nature of religion with a monster made out of excrement breaking up a strip joint ? There really isn't anything to compare this movie with (the only film that's even remotely similar is Gregory Widen's The Prophecy), although it has several links and shared actors/characters with Smith's other View Askew movies. It's a terrific mish-mash of ideas, a great riff on religious mythology, a touching story of a women overcoming a heartbreaking tragedy in her life, an easy-going road movie and a thoroughly cracked comedy. Every character is fascinating and all the performances are wonderful, particularly Lee, Hayek, Rickman and the writer-director as the lovable Silent Bob, and Morissette makes for one of cinema's most original depictions of God. Although it's extremely well made, the quality really comes through in the writing, which is both imaginative and vulgar in equal measures. These characters may happen to exist on a different plane of existence, but they still suffer from all-too-human neuroses and foibles. Fiorentino, who specialises in laid-back pragmatists, is an unusual choice for the bewildered heroine, but her reliable performance makes the wackier ones all the more funny as she fights off disbelief, denial, incomprehension, sexual advances and the end of Creation. A great goofy religious epiphany of a film - don't miss it.

This movie turns things a bit topsy-turvy as the two central characters, angels, are the bad guys.The whole movie from beginning to end is a tongue-n-cheek run up of religion--George Carlin a tough New Jersey-sounding cardinal Glick (The Catholic Church is Never Wrong); Chris Rock the 13th apostle Rufus; Salma Hayek as Muse and Silent Bob and Jay playing their usual characters. Silent Bob actually speaks a line and can be called a hero when he almost single-handedly takes on Bartleby & Loki on the train. Brilliant, I laugh just thinking of these characters. Then there's good old Ben and Matt--eye candy bad guys. Alan Rickman deserves a note for playing Metatron, a somewhat mysterious, Anglo-accented and stern Angel who seems to do God's talking for her and Jason Lee who plays the gangster-like Azrael. There's a little literature and religion hidden in here too as the movie seems to use Milton's Paradise Lost (the revolt of the Angel Lucifer and followers against god and their being cast down to hell) to set up the story.God is not only a woman, but a goofy one--God does not speak in this movie at all. Alanis Morrisette played this role perfectly...when she started doing handstands in front of the church...I nearly lost it.There is some blood and carnage, starting with the Stygian Triplets attacking god on the boardwalk, the scene in the bar where Azrael offs the bartender and of course the climactic scene in front of the church. Not too rough to watch and at least in furtherance of the plot.This is a light comedy worth watching...too bad Catholics were offended, they have more to worry about than this little movie.

Clerks was great, Mallrats was entertaining, Chasing Amy was perfect, and now comes Dogma. The word for this is... Perfect. Kevin Smith proves for the second time that he knows how to make a comedy hilarious, and thought provoking at the same time. Chasing Amy started out funny, and eventually, started making you think. The dialog in Dogma that makes you think, is all funny. It makes some daring, but really deep, and thoughtful points about religion, and makes you question God (in a good way).The film follows two angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck), and Loki (Matt Damon). They have been banished from heaven a long time ago, and for the past 1000 years, have been stranded in a place far worse than hell... Wisconsin. Until one day, the Catholic church makes a new law. Anyone who passes through the arches at a particular church, shall be forgiven for all their sins, and given a morally clean slate. The angels see this as a loophole to sneak back into heaven. What they don't know, is that if they pass through the arch, they'll destroy existence.In desperation, unable to find God (Alanis Morrisette), the angel who speaks for God, the Metatron (Alan Rickman), summons the reluctant last descendant of Christ, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), to track down and stop the angels from entering the church. She sets off on a quest, aided by two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes), and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), and the 13th apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock). This is a long movie, but it's so darn entertaining, that you won't want it to be over when it is. Jay and Silent Bob, Smith's recurring characters, have their biggest role yet. It's also their funniest (until Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Jay is hysterical. He's the kind of guy who you think is awesome, but also needs to get his ass kicked. And Matt Damon has his best role ever, as Loki, the former angel of death. In one scene, he and Bartleby are discussing their upcoming mass genocide right in front of the gun store owner. They intend to punish the staff of a children's show called Mooby the Golden Calf. They think the creators of the show are committing idolatry, but it's really just a fatal coincidence. This leads to the funniest scenes in the movie.The film always maintains it's light, comedic tone, even when the plot takes some rather serious turns. The blood-soaked finale proves to be one of the most suspenseful climaxes I've ever seen in a comedy, even if it does involve things like drunk angels, and Jay with a machine gun (don't ask). The film is often as thrilling and intense as Chasing Amy was sad and heart-wrenching. And any film maker who can combine those tones with such big laughs has to be a genius. Be warned though, Dogma is one of the most violent comedies I've ever seen. Though it doesn't ever seem to get acknowledged, the film contains surprisingly graphic stabbings, shootings, exploding heads, splattered... you get the picture. Squeamish beware. Also, screw the protesters, this is one of the most pro-God movie's I've seen.

If you take a step back and see the movie for what it is worth, it is a satire. There is nothing in the movie that puts down Jesus or God unless you find offense to the ideas that God could be a woman or a man and that perhaps Jesus was black. Personally going to Catholic School for 14 years, I do not take offense to that because who cares if Jesus was black or God might be female. It doesn;t change any of the teachings. The satire comes in when speaking about the institution of the church and how corrupt it has been. If anybody knows anything about Church History, the Catholic Church is not the perfect. It is human like the rest of us and that is what makes this movie so great and smart. We analyzed all the scenes and characters and found that this gave us a new idea and outlook of how we can approach religion in the 21st century. It also makes God more personable to us all and, in my opinion, is one of the most important things we need right now in this messed up world. Kevin Smith, a Catholic, is genius when it came to make this movie.

But i would like to emphasise that the authors of the latter opinion outlined above are narrow minded vindictive movie viewers, in fact not even movie viewers but sad people who are boxed of in their little religious worlds and cant appreciate a bit of humour.I am Sikh, fairly religious, and have broad shoulders in that i can take a bit banter about my religion. In my opinion religion without any solid evidential footing (i.e. god coming down from the skies and laying down the rules to humans face to face) can only ever be speculation or as many like to say A BELIEF! But what is a belief? Simply an opinion! I will never discourage people having belief, but i will question accepted wisdom. And i think that thats all Kevin Smith has done in Dogma. He has an opinion which he has expressed in a film, and he's no idiot, he knows his stuff. He has researched a few religions and has intelligently questioned many orthodoxy's. I love this movie because of this and despite the f*****g's and the b*****d's, there is an eye opening angle to religion which he delightfully delivers with help from Hollywood's finest.This is a great film.

This totally original and fun film boasts an all star cast and tells the tale of a woman who was raised Catholic but works in a planned parenthood clinic, and who feels like her religion is empty and her faith in God has only let her down. Yet she is handed down a duty that, at first, seems ludicrous. Just go to a church in New Jersey on the day of its centennial celebration.God told Noah to build a big boat because it was gonna rain really hard for a long time. He told Adam and Eve not to eat a certain kind of fruit. He told Abraham to kill his kid and offer him up as a gift on an altar. God tells people to do weird things, and his requests really seem like they make no sense at all, but everything he asks is for a reason. I'm glad Kevin Smith didn't make Bethany's mission into some big, grand obvious thing, but rather a strange, simple thing that at first seemed ridiculous, and had to be explained little by little.The script is full of dialogue that is nothing but love of God, especially the dialogue of Rufus and Metatron. The two rebellious, clueless, and sad angels, Loki and Bartleby, begin as beings who really love and miss their relationship with God. Loki is angry and hoping to regain the favor of God by slaying wicked people (He used to be the Angel of Death) and Bartleby, once a peaceful-minded angel who convinced Loki that what he was doing was cold blooded, becomes so angry and resentful that God won't ever forgive angels like he does humans, pretty much turns into Satan Jr., willing to make war with God even though nothing he does will ever get him back into Heaven.Of course, Jay and Silent Bob are on hand, singled out to be prophets for God, at least for a while, and they accompany Bethany on her journey from Illinois to Jersey. En route, they meet Rufus, the 13th apostle who was never mentioned (surely there are plenty of apostles and heroes of the Bible who never got their limelight); Serendipity, an abstract who became semi-solid and stripteases to New Edition tunes!!!; and the stinky Golgothan Dook-Demon (not for weak stomachs!!!) The cast includes Linda Fiorentino, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Jay and Silent Bob, a hysterical Jason Lee as Azrael, a demon who likes to play from all sides; and the always wonderful Alan Rickman, whose elegant presence blends in curiously well with characters who cuss and smoke weed. It all goes together in this wonderful, strange, but very sincere love letter to organized religion and its many flaws.More importantly, though, it's a love letter to God, not to a faction, a church, or list of man-made by-laws, but to God him/herself, containing what should be common sense knowledge that we all have, but sadly do not. That makes Kevin Smith a very perceptive voice for a generation who wants to know and love God without all the man made stuff getting in the way...Watch it without prejudice. If you can't do that, well, I guess there's nothing more to say. "},{"Title":"Don't Take this Film Too Seriously!

I am entertained by this film and have seen it repeatedly. This film is not for the religious at all, so don't take it seriously. I also gave it an 7 because I think Kevin Smith could have done a better job. First, he has an excellent cast of actors like Linda Florentino, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alan Rickman (he deserves something in England for all his wonderful work like an O.B.E. or Officer of the British Empire), Kevin Smith, atheist George Carlin, Janeane Garofalo, Chris Rock, etc. The plot is complicated. Bethany is chosen to save the earth by stopping 2 angels-Damon and Affleck from entering a church in Red Bank, New Jersey (Kevin Smith's territory). I won't get into details about why or where but I am always intrigued to watch this film on Comedy Central repeatedly over the weekend. I loved Alan Rickman's role as the voice of God. While I won't reveal my own personal religious beliefs, I don't think God is that cruel or unforgiving as it is believed in this film. But I loved Affleck and Damon as the Bartleby and Loki. It's worth watching! I was reading about Kevin Smith not getting along with Linda Fiorentino on the set. Supposedly, she is difficult person but she admits it herself. The role of Bethany is wonderfully performed by Linda Fiorentino. Her best scenes are with Affleck and Rickman. Linda is the kind of person who doesn't take stuff from anybody especially directors and some male costars like Kevin Smith. Maybe Linda is the kind of person who prefers control over her own life especially on the set. Women in this business are never treated fairly. It's still a man's game in Hollywood. A game she won't play by their rules. I'm glad that Linda isn't on the cover of some tabloid with her own problems. Anyway last night I did research on Linda Fiorentino. Despite rumors, the director from Last Seduction would like to work with her again. She was in a film directed by Anthony Edwards and acted with him previously in another film as well. The rumors of her difficult personality might be the fact that she was also turned down for the Sharon Stone role in Basic Instinct because her breasts weren't big enough for them. Same thing happened with Kevin Smith, he cared more about her breasts and put a double in her place. How come there are male doubles out there of Ben Affleck or Matt Damon? Sorry but I have to side with Linda. She is beautiful, talented, and intelligent. Regarding the Tommy Lee Jones rumor that he wouldn't do Men in Black II if Fiorentino was in it. THe director said that he offered the part to Linda but it was too small and her character was going to be killed off. She didn't want the role and didn't do it. Maybe jones and smith didn't want a woman like Linda Fiorentino to take away their thunder in the sequel as she did in the first movie. Sorry, I just thought I might try to defend Linda since she won't defend herself publicly. She is too cool for that. SHe is happy being a loving aunt, photographer, and living in New York City. I wish her the best. She said that she just doesn't suck up to people like directors like Kevin Smith.

The obvious glee that Kevin Smith takes in attempting to shock the audience with boring and forced sacreligious statements (Noah was a drunk. Look what he accomplished. And no one's even asking you to build an ark.) will make most people roll their eyes; those that don't will most likely laugh giddly at the bland and fairly obvious critiques of catholism. The most irritating thing about this film is that, if it is in fact a genuine attempt on Smith's part to express his personal philosophy, its rather depressing, and at best he comes off as inarticulate.  In any case, the worst part of the movie comes at the end, when we finally see God, in the form of one of the most annoying pop singers to ever exist.  The only good thing about this part is that the bitch doesn't talk until the very end when she blows up someone's head with her screeching, which is a fairly accurate representation of her singing career in my opinon.

For 'Dogma', however, Smith has abandoned his normal stomping ground of everyday America to make an attempted religious satire.  The obvious precedent is Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' - but whereas that film was almost entirely about humans (with Jesus simply providing the backdrop), Smith has made a film in which God, and an assortment of angels, are actual characters.  This is audacious, but sadly the execution is poor in the extreme.  With a huge reservoir of source material (the Bible, plus the history of Christianity) to draw on, and a pretty easy target to hit, Smith could surely have taken some central idea to make his point instead, he picks and chooses from a vast range of starting points, but reduces them all to the most purile of jokes.  The humour in this film appears to be aimed at ten-year-old schoolboys; but aside from its latent unfunniness, it is so far removed from the subject of its mockery that it fails to succeed in mocking at all.  The most ardent anti-Catholic would not base their position on the idea that homesick angels go around shooting people more or less at random what's offensive about this film is not how much it has to do with religion, but how little.  Even when we get some more serious reflections, they never rise above the level of the mundane they feel like the observations of a child who thinks that church is boring but who does not yet understand anything about why it the church exists - for good or evil, organised religion is part of the fabric of our society, and without that understanding a film about belief has nothing to say.  Meanwhile, an all star cast largely embarras themselves, while apparently suffering from a contagious bout of Tourette's syndrome.  On this evidence, Kevin Smith should stick with the small stuff - when it comes to the big picture, he really has no idea.

It would probably be just that if the two extremes were in any way presented cohesively.  Instead, this film is episodic (preaching, senseless killing, preaching, farting, preaching, foul language, preaching, scatological humor) and still manages to be very very pretentious.  I am not at all religious and would have loved to have seen a smart well-though-out and satirical look (and/or attack) on the whole idea of organized religion.  This wasn't it.  Or anything like it.

That aside, this is still a pretty good film, a comedy that also takes on some serious issues concerning organized religion, while avoiding, for the most part, being excessively preachy about it. The best parts, as in all Smith films, are the dialog scenes. In this instance, we get conversations between a woman who goes through the motions of attending church but has pretty much lost faith, a pair of fallen angels looking for revenge, another angel who needs to enlist the woman (Bethany) to stop the aforementioned evil duo, Rufus, the 13th Apostle, Serendipidy the Muse (played by the sizzling Salma Hayek) and of course, Jay & Silent Bob, a pair of clueless stoner prophets. Each of the characters is well constructed and acted, and their various interactions shed an unconventional light on many aspects of the Catholic Church in particular, and religion in general. Hardcore fundamentalists would probably find this movie insulting, even blasphemous, but the rest of us will see it for what it is, a humorous look at some of the foibles of organized religion. Kevin Smith clearly can distinguish between poking fun at certain Dogmas while at the same time showing respect for the larger underlying concepts of faith and goodness.What doesn't work, however, are the action scenes, most notably the ending, which gets pretty bloody and gory. Not to mention his choice of God, who is uncredited and thus, I suppose, considered a spoiler, so I'll merely say that the classic Rodney Dangerfield line `Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it' aptly describes the actor chosen for this honor. Also, he relies too much on gross out humor, which is a shame, since comic dialog is really his forte. For example, angels apparently have no sex organs. Fine, he can tell us that, he doesn't need to have Alan Rickman pull down his pants and show us. And show us and show us, in a scene that seems to go on forever. And then there's the great poop monster-demon. Perhaps Kevin Smith saw how successful movies like Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary were, and decided to get on the gross bandwagon, but at least for me, it just doesn't work. And, in a film about religion, he probably could have cut back on the gratuitous swearing a bit without losing any of the humor. Still, it's an all around decent effort in which the stuff that works clearly exceeds the stuff that doesn't.     7/10  "},{"Title":"We are not amused.","Date":"16 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Warning contains spoilers.From what I have observed, there seem to be two main philosophical camps concerning Dogma ie 1) it is yet more evidence of Kevin Smith's mind-blowing cinematographic genius (suck suck)2) it is a blasphemous piece of bilge that has put the souls of all those responsible for its creation in dire peril of Hell.Well, I subscribe to neither of the above two views.  Instead, I am someone who hated Dogma simply because it SUCKED!  My reasons for believing that this film stank are quite numerous; to make things easier for the reader, I shall list them in point form.  Here goes...1) The film was overlong and so, so boring.2) Salma Hayek's whiny muse character was bloody irritating, especially in the way she called Azrael selfish for simply wanting to end his torment in Hell (well, it was easy for her to criticize given that she wasn't there).3) Alanis Morrisette was even more irritating (about a million times more so, in fact) as God.  Note to Kevin Smith she wasn't cute, she wasn't funny, she was just plain bloody annoying.4) Silent Bob's attempts to look cute by staring dumbly at the camera all the time failed, miserably.5) Death by shooting was considered an appropriate penalty for adultery.6) The only innocent person in the boardroom of the company responsible for Mooby Cow also happened to be the only woman there.  Yeah right.  A real suck-up to the feminist (and conservative!) myth that women are paragons of virtue and incapable of fault.7) The film pushed that bulls**t line about how people who suicide go to Hell.  The way that this pernicious belief of Christianity seems to have infiltrated so many films and TV shows nauseates me.8) Most of all, the film was one of the most hypocritical crocks of s**t I have seen in a long time.

If you look at all films Silent Bob made, there isn't a single one among them that could even remotely be called confrontational to anything. They all have a lightly ironic tone which is mainly aimed against the characters themselves, seldom to the subject matter at hand which in most cases is very little matter to begin with. They provide a backdrop for a lot of funny dialogue which can be outrageous sometimes (as Amy's revelation in Chasing Amy) but always gets downplayed in terms of effect.What bugged me a bit here was that Kevin inserted some New-age aforisms on religion which were not funny and usually a cliche. You get the feeling he put them in to take the sting out of supposedly blasphemous scriptpoints but there's really no sting anyway so it could have done without them.Plotwise the film is a bit messy because there are too many characters to follow here (which is problematic because there's no sub-plot) you kind of lose track and most characters don't get fleshed out as they should have.

He becomes the pivotal character in this film, not because he plays an important part in the plot, but because he always provides a delicious touch of moronic genius to scenes which tend to become too heavy-handed or sentimental (especially the final scene).Don't think you will get an insight into religion here, what you will get is a very funny film which doesn't take itself or anything to seriously with very good performances from Ben Affleck (never seen him better), Alan Rickman (never seen him bad in anything) and especially Linda Fiorentino (never see enough of her).

Noel Coward, you are not, Mr. Smith. Or even Tarantino for that matter. As to the supposed theological content itself, if you're gonna make a movie that calls into question the dogma of a particular religion, you should really come up with something to disprove or at least challenge those long held beliefs. Other than portraying God as Alanis Morrissette, a statement about as profound as that insipid Counting Blue Cars song. Instead, Mr. Smith not only failed to expose any truths about religious dogma, he actually relied on the same dogma to advance and resolve his belabored story. Isn't it ironic? Dontcha think? And please don't let me forget Kevin's (can I call you Kevin?) total lack of ability to shoot a movie in a cinematic manner or to direct actors. C'mon, folks! Affleck is borderline at best and Salma Hayek is window dressing at best. Smith obviously has no grasp of subtlety and neither do his actors. Here's an idea! Let's have a movie where Chris Rock ISN'T funny and Alan Rickman looks as out of place as Pat Buchanan in a Cinqo De Mayo Parade. Smith has all the visual style of an episode of Maude. Look Kev (can I call you Kev?), stick to low budget yarns about comic book nerds who date squeaky voiced lesbians and leave the more challenging issues like religion and politics and pop culture to people who don't think Jason Lee dressed up like the old Pepperidge Farm guy makes for a very scary demon.

However, it is rarely fun to watch. After the initially amusing first twenty minutes, the lofty subject matter soon takes over, yet Smith fails to change the film's tone accordingly. Jay's constant sexual banter and the knowing film references soon become tiresome, whilst the actors are either bored or confused by the events that surround them. Smith, who is not a visual director, seems uneasy shooting anything other then long monologues, and as a result the new special effects and &#145;scope framing that he has to play with go to waste. The larger budget looks as though it has been spent on casting rather then good ideas and the up-shot of this is that an encounter with a &#145;s**t monster' and the &#145;wacky' boardroom massacre become two examples of many dismal attempts at comedy. The fight at the end, for example, is crying for some action, yet Smith breaks all the tension by resorting to yet more crude, irritating dialogue. The insinuation the Jesus was black and that God is a woman hardly seem original concepts these days yet Smith treats them as though they are ground breaking. The questioning of religious faith seems to be what this film is all about, but you're more likely to question why spent money watching the film in the first place. Hopeless.

The violence is inexplicably graphic, not to mention unfunny.  The normally wonderful cast including Alan Rickman, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock and Ben Affleck are all but undone by the material.  DOGMA is a poor attempt at religious satire, or is it really about the need for religion in modern life?

His humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's.  He grew up idolizing Star Wars and loves comic books, having allso written a few.  He also has a cult following, mostly composed of teenagers, college students, and Smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups.  Smith is hilarious in person and in writing, but when he tries to be earnest and moralize, that is when he goes wrong.  I think Kevin Smith is a better writer than director.Great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them.  This was true in the overrated Chasing Amy, and it is true for Dogma as well. That is not to say Smith's message is a bad one.  In Dogma, Smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into God and God's desires is superior to anyone else's.  Basically, dogmatism is bad.  Changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible, and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight, they also know what is best for you, whether you like it or not.  This is not exactly a new message in movies (see Inherit the Wind), but I have no problems with recycling old ones, particularly since Dogma's protesters are proving Smith's point.  Smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a Dogma for Dummies book.  But this is Smith's personality, and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the Bible (or Koran, etc.) correctly (or if there even is a correctly) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns.The story concerns abortion clinic worker Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) being chosen by Voice of God, Metatron (Alan Rickman), to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Angel of Death, Loki (Matt Damon).  Along the way, forgotten thirteenth Apostle, Rufus (Chris Rock), stripper muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek), and slacker duo Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith himself) come to Bethany's aid.  Fallen muse, Azrael (Jason Lee), proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery.The logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make Smith's points, and in itself, has little dramatic momentum.  Among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that God is a woman, Jesus was black, and the Bible was written by a bunch of racist, misogynistic white men.  Of course, Kevin Smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself.  They are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic.  Smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie.  When Harvey Weinstein asked Smith to put it into the film before Cannes, Smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious, but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke.The film's humor is uneven.  Some parts are very funny as when Bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when Metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance. But many of the film's jokes just bomb, as in virtually anything involving Salma Hayek's Serendipity.  Also, some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away.  Still, Smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace.  Among the actors, Fiorentino and Rickman stand out by far. Fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight.  > "},{"Title":"Feels like purgatory","Date":"18 March 2012","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Technically competent yet unexpectedly boring vanity project.

If any of the film's points was daring or innovative I might be less scathing about it,but the idea of a black supreme being has been mooted in the cinema for seventy years,so it's hardly cutting edge comedy or shocking - in fact the concept that an audience might find it funny is quite offensive,possibly even racist.

Especially as an american movie, considering that the US isn't exactly known to be the most tolerant country in the christian world when it comes to religious issues... Something that is clear when you read some of the comments, as those behind them try to hide their religious reasons for trashing this movie behind less believable arguments, like bad acting (Sure, with crappy actors like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon to screw it up, right?), bad plot (No, Dogma isn't original in ANY way, or what?) and so on.But if we all set our hidden agendas aside, and take a more objective and less discriminating look at Dogma, most of us will agree that this is a good movie. The acting is way above average, each actor does a good job in making unbelievable characters seem believable. The plot is very good as well, as it makes a hardly believable story seem somewhat believable, giving the (secular) audience quite a few good laughs. The excremental is a schoolbook example of the originality that makes this movie great - Instead of having the more or less conventional demon with horns, wings, a scary visage burst out of a flaming hole in the ground, we are confronted with a walking pile of crap who crawled out of the john... (Kind of reminds me of one of my old school teachers, by the way...) Dogma is a fresh breeze among all these other dull, boring and oh-so-predictable movies about The End Of The World, the standard setting for most other movies with a religious theme.It's just a movie. Enjoy it, or watch something else.Judging by some of the comments here, I feel that there are far more important issues about Dogma than just acting and plot - Are you religious and feel offended by this flick? Then I'm sure you deserve it, one way or the other. That's what this movie is about, the hypocrisy among many religious individuals, who consider themselves to be so moral, god loving and above the non-believers, but have a real hard time to practice what they preach. The cardinal is one example, when confronted with something that might as well happen according to the bible, he refuses to believe that it IS actually happening! So if you find Dogma offensive, you should probably blame yourself in the first place, for being too narrow minded and intolerant to accept any other ideas about christianity than those of your own. This, I believe is another important point that this movie has, there are plenty of people walking the face of this planet that pretend to be truly religious, yet unable to name even half of the ten commandments. There are many examples of this throughout history. Like the televangelism or various christian cults (using twisted and false interpretations of the bible), all in order to gain control over other peoples minds, and particulary their money, according to the situation of today. Or the crusades during the medieval time, as well as burning of presumed witches and other infidels. The reasons never change, only the methods. And if you prefer christianity to be a source for strength and inspiration instead of a tool for oppression (as it have actually been in Europe during the earlier centuries), you'd better accept movies and stories that dare to make fun of the religion, or you might as well see your society turn into a christian version of Iran or Afghanistan, where tyrants use the word of god as a weapon against the freedom of the people.If anyone is to judge the people behind this movie, that has to be god and none other! ;-)Anyone who condemn this movie or its creators simply because of the religious theme should seriously rethink his or her life.

Now I am reviewing Kevin Smith's Dogma. Don't see the link? However tenuous it may seem, there is one. I will elaborate Fight Club is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is equal parts savage, primal, scathingly clever, subtle, engaging, subversive, and dangerous, without stopping for breath for its entire running length. The relevance of this to Dogma is how inherently opposed it seems to be to be any of these things. It is a tiresome, flaccid affair, and the complete opposite of Fight Club in the two most important categories I watched all of Fight Club (many times), and I would feel comfortable in calling Fight Club an actual film.Oh, was this movie torturous. I'll make a handy comparison for those who don't really want to hear technical nonsense about characterisation or plot development (at least nonsense in this case; there is none). You're in a lecture theatre, awaiting the arrival of renowned atheist Richard Dawkins. You're expecting 10 minutes of lecture time, followed by food and pool in the Student's Union (i.e. to get to the part of the film where it starts being all, you know, filmic). Instead, someone is subbing for him. It is George Carlin. Except, he's drunk and, somehow, forgotten to be either funny or clever. So you're sitting there for an hour and a half, waiting for this embittered old man to at least pause for breath (for characterisation to set in, or for the plot to become clear). Instead, you're watching the guy make the same point in different guises for the horrible duration of it. In Dogma, you're watching various elements being cobbled together with no apparent sense of structure; Ben Affleck and Matt Damon appear to discuss religion (skipping actual dialogue), Alan Rickman materialises as an angel to talk about his two mischievous fellow angels (OMG PARADOX!) and Chris Rock appears to do...something. After an hour of being bashed over the head with this rubbish, I just stopped caring. Now, this is supposed to be a religious comedy, so an element of farce would be fine. One requirement, however, is that the situation falls apart in a funny way. This is a film that falls apart in a way that is tragic, not funny. Even when Kevin Smith remembers to give his actors a little to work with, ie real dialogue, it's....still not funny. In fact, I didn't laugh once during the hour in which I writhed in my seat, itching to put something else on. Thus it is a film that fails on absolutely every level. And, ho boy, that's only from the first hour. I've been told in the past that I have to watch the whole film before I can judge. Here's a tip to filmmakers (Butterfly Effect Guy, pay attention) if you want to wait until the last half an hour to make your film good, the audience must be aware that the film is going in the direction of being good; better this than Dogma, which seems to perpetually circle the drain. Usually in the case of religiously orientated films, it is the job of the reviewer to interpret the film's religious implications. At least Dogma is kind in this respect it makes no effort to be subtle about its standpoint. All Kevin Smith forgot to do was make a film to go along with it.

I am still not sure how on Earth he has such a cult following.  The only film of his that was good, was Chasing Amy and even that had its flaws.  He also has the pleasure of directing a film that is on my top five worst films list which is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Be that as it may my problems with Dogma are a little different than most of his films.  The first time I saw it I kinda liked it.  The second time I realized how bad it was.  First of all choosing to satarize the catholic church, especially in film form, is like writing a love poem.  It's been done so many times you had better do something new or different, Smith does neither of these.  I think of the films of Buneul, Felini, certainly the Monty Python stuff, certain Woody Allen films and so forth and that's what I think of as good satire of the church.  There are countless others that did the subject so much better than here.  The biggest problem that I had with Dogma is that the film had no idea what it wanted to be.  It kept switching from semi-serious film to farce.  Normally I don't have a problem with genre bending, but here it shouldn't be done.  If this film was a farce than all the serious elements are out of place and pointless.  If this film is suppose to be more serious, say just a normal variety of comedy(for an example As Good as it Gets), all the farcicle elements become really asinine.  Take the reasoning for why the universe is going to be wiped out of existence.  If this is not a farce(and I mean Marx Brothers, Monty Python brand of farce) then that idea is so ridiculous it doesn't deserve to be thought of.  First of all if we are focussing on the catholic church, perhaps we should consider what they actuall believe.  According to the bible(not a bible nut, just happen to know this) angels can't be redeemed.  Period.  No confession, no archway, they are angels and not humans.  According to this films premise, if Lucifer walked through the archway he would be able to go back to heaven.  Of course he'd have to cut his horns off, I would imagine going with Smiths wing thing.  In this case, why didn't Azreal do it?  He was also an angel cast down, why couldn't he walk through the arches and undo all of creation? They are not human beings and therefore not subject to the same rules. End of discussion.  Too much of this film is trying to make a serious commment on religious dogma, and it tries to do so by ignoring what the catholic church and the bible actually says.  Couldn't Smith come up with something not totally idiotic to hinge the film on?  Since this is the base of the films story I must say that this film is completely pointless.  Outside of that the Jay and Silent Bob stuff here is really annoying and their pressence is pointless and forced.  Then of course there was the scene where Kevin Smith showed how bad of a writer he is when he gets out of the S*** Demon sequence by using odor spray.  This is moronic and worthy of a Junior High school laugh.  Even S*** Demon repelant(ala Batman style) would have been funier.  The truth is, Smith knew of no better way to get out of the scene and he is a very sloppy writer.  He isn't much better as a director as there is absolutely nothing visually interesting about this film, and that is the directors MAIN job.  We are after all talking about a visual medium.

A blasphemy cannot be dodged for sure, but eventually the film appears not as subversive as the synopsis suggests, au fond, Smith simply picks various characters from religious myth and squeeze them into a wacky adventure of fantasy without even badmouthing Catholicism, there should be no hard-feeling (as the opening pointers amusingly noted).So the dogma is God is infallible, two angels' plan will precipitate the undoing of the present human world, thus the last scion of God's bloodline, Bethany (Fiorentino), is a divorcée works in an abortion clinic who is infertile, is informed by Metatron (Rickman) to stop them with the allies of two prophets Jay and Silent Bob (Mewes and Smith himself), the said Rufus and the Muse Serendipity (Hayek), who is trapped in a writer's block and moonlights as a stripper. Also involved is the evil force led by a demon Azrael (Lee) and the Stygian Triplets, not to mention the crass excremental creature Golgothan which Azrael summons.All these modifications and additions are reflecting Smith's geeky upbringing, a bit vulgar nevertheless, but also straightforwardly amusing, and it even becomes more topical as a cultural phenomenon now. Among the motley crew of the cast, Alan Rickman pops out with his noble persona as the second-only-to-God Metatron (in spite of his unconventional look), who is allocated with the forbidding task to materialise in front of the unwitting Bethany, explain the whole absurd scenario convincingly to her and persuade her to fulfil the mission, believe it or not, he actually carries it through wonderfully. Florentino (now completely retired from the screen) discharges a phlegmatic quality contrary of others' comedy-leaning dramatisation and loquacity (bar Silent Bob). Damon and Affleck are quite at ease to play off each other and Hayek is at the crest of her physical beauty whereas Rock is in his own comfortable zone without being too irritating.

To be honest he does nothing wrong with either element, but once they are put together it just doesn't fit. It's like getting scenes from The Seventh Seal while watching Monty Python, both are good at what they do but they work horribly together.With this said it's still an entertaining watch. I mean if you don't find Kevin Smith funny then I don't think this will change your opinion of him in any way shape or form. However if you do find him funny then it's not like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back where he uses F-bombs in every sentence with the hopes of getting a laugh, not to say there isn't anything resembling that in this movie.So if you can get past combining something stupid with something intelligent muddled together then you'll probably like this movie more than I did. I don't see anything wrong with either but it just really doesn't work together, or at least not that well. So at the end of the day, because yes it did make me laugh and yes it did make me think about religion, this deserves a solid 7/10.

The conversations are sooo painfully tedious, and the script is so self satisfied with its ceaseless onslaught of intricate theological conjecture. What if God did this, or what if God did that?... What if God told you to leave him the hell out of your silly chatter? Circular logic and self confirming irrationality dominate the talk. I chuckled a bit in the first twenty minutes, mostly at the absurd foul language, but from then on I was stone faced. It was mind numbing.This cute game of tentatively defying the powers that be with seemingly irreverent banter is so juvenile. Apparently, if you like to think of yourself as spiritually sensitive but fashionably hip this type of psychological masturbation is considered good fun. I am bored with the whole lame, puny, primitive subject of God and morality and evil, so the intense discussions were grating and depressing. It wore me down. I needed to hear a strong voice declare that it was all stupid. No one finally clears their throat and plainly declares all the God chatter to be meaningless noise, complete bull#@$!.Absolutely the most emotionally, psychologically, physically tragic endeavor Mankind has ever engaged in is the formalization and perpetuation of these superstitious, paranoid, ignorant beliefs as evidenced by all the pain, suffering and mayhem that is their heritage. The film never even remotely approaches the contempt and scorn that this subject warrants. There's just way too much tolerance here of even the more seemingly benign aspects of faith, since I believe that the more moderate, average, reasonable believer is in fact the most potent, persistent promulgator of these harmful, destructive, idiotic doctrines. The curious inconsistencies and sweet little hypocrisies of mainstream religion are a growing cancer on the soul of humanity. Yeah, I believe this, and so do plenty of other people.

Along the way, she is aided by two prophets, Jay and Silent Bob. With the help of Rufus, the 13th Apostle, they must stop those who stand in their way and prevent the angels from entering Heaven.This is the second time I got myself immersed in the world of writer/director Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse (the first one being Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back) and in my opinion it got a whole lot better the second time around. Jay and Silent Bob was funny but in the weirdest of ways. It seemed like they were just resorting to Jay's cussing and bad mouthing to make the audience laugh. But the toilet humor can be funny on a certain extent. It can't work all the time that's why I'm in the middle when it comes to Jay and Silent Bob.But that is not the case here, Dogma on the other hand, had all the perfect laughs and offending humor with perfect timing. Even at the start of the film, I mean the very start with the disclaimer, oh man that was hilarious with Kevin Smith's fetish for platypuses and the aforementioned warning with the offensive tone of the film. Kevin Smith is a writing genius no questions asked. He knew his film would be torched by religious sects and fanatics so before they even got to it, he made his move with the disclaimer.The funniest scene has got to be the part where a naked Chris Rock just fell out of nowhere and then Jay says Beautiful, naked, big-titted women just don't fall out of the sky, you know oh man that was classic.

I expect viewers with no familiarity with the bible and/or fixed ideas about religion will find this film highly offensive. For the rest of us, who are going to heck anyway, it was a delightful comedy. Smith takes on God, angels, unruly toilets, and Wisconsin. As with most Kevin Smith films, New Jersey figures in there somehow. In Kevin's world, heaven suffers many of the same problems that humans face in the modern world. Things go to hell while the boss is away, and boy do they go to hell. First the Catholic church decides to update its image as though it hired an ad agency creating the Buddy Christ, then a priest (George Carlin) makes his church doorway a gateway to get into heaven free. It never occurs to him that two fired angels Bartleby and Loki, banished to Wisconsin by God, would take advantage of this loophole. And while they are at it they go on a rampage by killing people on buses and in one memorable scene almost the entire executive staff for a major corporation.For some reason the last scion of Christ, is an infertile and bitter fallen away Catholic woman (Linda Fiorentino) working in an abortion clinic. And for reasons only dimly revealed is needed to stop Loki and Bartleby from taking advantage of the New Jersey church loophole. This is a mission she is sent on by the Metatron, (Alan Rickman). One of the funniest parts of the movie is when Alan Rickman's character appears in Fiorentino's bedroom as the flaming voice of God only to be doused with a fire extinguisher.Jayson Blair and Kevin Smith, who have appeared in just about all Smith's films since Clerks are inevitably part of the action. They serve as the helpers in this quest to get the last scion to New Jersey in time. Blair plays the typically foul mouthed stoner whose only goal in life seems to be to get laid, and goes about it in the most unsubtle and foul mouthed way possible. Smith as always plays Silent Bob and while thankfully not as foul mouthed, being silent, is almost as clueless as Jay.All in all a splendid time will be had by all, except for those who have no sense of humor, no sense of the absurdity of much religious tradition, and those who think that excrement has no place in the pantheon of humor. Such people of course are just wrong.

I just wish Kevin Smith has worked a little harder at producing a thoughtful and intelligent script, and not one that shoe-horned all his old mates into a piece that rarely rises above the level of school-boy humour.Religion in all its forms offers nothing but intellectual slavery, backward thinking atrophy, offensive racism and extremism that will ultimately result in the death knell for the human race.

It is not however, a film that withstands repeat viewings with its integrity fully intact and while it remains as fresh and funny as ever each time you pop the DVD in of an evening, one or two cracks do begin to emerge. One question that will perhaps keep recurring though is just what it is exactly that the Catholic league has against this movie? Okay, some folks might have a bit of a problem with God being played as a frolicking garden pixie shaped like Alanis Morrisette and wonder why it was that the maker of all creation had to be so irritating. And yes, having the last known descendant of Christ be an abortion clinic worker was bound to rile up a fundamentalist or two. And George Carlin's brilliantly hilarious Priest isn't exactly the standard depiction of a senior clergyman by any means...but the heart of the movie is very much a celebration of Christianity. Faith is presented quite clearly as a rewarding and beautiful thing and what Dogma really boils down to is a criticism of organised religion, so you do have to wonder what the fuss is? Actually, I think I just answered my own question there...Anyway, the plot is a surprisingly active one for a Kevin Smith film. Not content with writing another laid back slacker adventure, he has his eyes firmly set on a biblical road movie in which a woman named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) suddenly finds herself being called upon from on high to stop two angels from exploiting a loophole and making their way back to heaven, the pair having been banished after a drinking binge got ugly. Joining her on this quest are Chris Rock as the wise cracking thirteenth apostle (he was left out of the bible because he's black apparently) and Smith regulars Jay and Silent Bob.What follows is not only hogs heaven for all Smith geeks out there but also a film that anyone who isn't a Catholic league member can enjoy. Newcomers will relish the back and forth dialogue, witty exchanges and pop culture nods that Smith is the master of, while those who like to get a bit more in depth will also find plenty to chew on as they play Spot the Regular (Hey, there's Randall! And hey hey, there's Dante too...And that's the restaurant they work in...). While the script remains fantastically written as always, Dogma's more busy pace is a welcome change from the norm, even as it becomes apparent that exiled Angels of Death are prone to the same sort of conversations as disgruntled convenience store owners.However, while it is all riotously enjoyable on the first viewing, second time around it isn't quite so good. Don't get me wrong, it's still fantastic stuff, but something's missing. Smith, for all his writing strengths hasn't quite learnt how to craft a road movie, a fact that becomes especially apparent when the gang are threatened by a foul-smelling demon but despite imminent death, Salma Hayek still finds time to rattle off an incredibly detailed description of its origins and lifestyle. Furthermore, Linda Fiorentino wasn't the right choice for Bethany, the majority of her lines being delivered in a bored and passionless manner that suggests she would much rather be anywhere else than on the set of a Hollywood movie working with a famous director. The increased involvement of Jay and Silent Bob meanwhile may raise a few cheers, but the extension of their roles from mere cameos serves to demonstrate how painfully unfunny Jason Mewes really is.That said, Dogma is still a fun movie. It is an energetic and spirited romp which the director clearly poured his heart into and while there are weak links, the majority of the cast are on top form (especially Ben Affleck, who has charisma practically gushing out of his ears). Click on the trivia section of this page and you'll find that Smith originally wanted Robert Rodriguez to direct it and had he done so the movie would have been arguably better paced, but have lost a little bit of its soul along the way. And just in case this analysis is giving the wrong impression (hey, even I'm starting to think I'm being hard on the guy), Dogma is a great movie. It's just not a fantastic one, that's all.

The interplay between Damon and Afflect reveals a comfort level in actors I rarely see. This probably is a result of their longtime working and personal relationship.

Yeah there's the whole two renegade Angels trying to find their way back into Heaven, but that's not really what the movie is about. In my opinion the movie is about having faith in God, and that some of the little details don't matter so much. The only thing matters is that you believe in God. Personally I loved when Rufus makes fun of Bethany / Catholism for believing that Mary and Joseph never had other children. Come on. It's a leap of faith to believe a virgin gave birth, but it's divine intervention for a man and wife never to have sex. Mary and Joseph were humans like you and me and if at 13 I'm starting to wonder about sex, you think a 13 year old girl and a 20-ish year old man weren't itching to find out? And in all honesty that is a little detail. The important thing to take away from the movie is that having faith in God matters more than did or did not Mary have other children, does the communion wafer actually turn into the body of Christ - those don't matter any where near as much as believing.

All others except these are also good especially Chris Rock who say's some of the best lines in a comedy I've heard. The music, editing, directing and everything is as great as in all other smiths films. This is a movie I could recommend to almost every one, yeah maybe not those who has something against ugly language because there's a lot of that but would you expect other? This movie is the second best film to Smiths Clerks, this has almost everything and shouldn't be overlooked by anyone. If you haven't seen it buy, loan, rent it directly, just see it. You won't regret it.

It has an overall great message too. Watch it, seriously. Especially if you love Jay and Silent Bob movies. Bethany (a woman who has lost her faith in God, but is also the last Zion aka Jesus's distant relative) is sent by Metatron (Alan Rickman!) to stop two renegade fallen angels (Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartelby (Ben Afflek)). She meets up with two prophets, Jay and Silent Bob (Heck Yes!), the 13th apostle Rufus (Chris Rock) and the former muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek). Together they try and stop not only Loki and Bartelby from unmaking existence, as well as the one controlling them, Azrael (a former muse and now really angry demon).

She is given the task to stop misguided angels, Loki and Bartelby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from entering a church thus having their sins forgiven and all of existence abolished. Bethany is assisted by Jay and Silent Bob, Rufus (Chris Rock) and Serendipity (Salma Hayek). All of these characters have their own outlook and opinions of God and the Bible. Theology is jam packed into this movie in a very clever way, however, it is jam packed to the extent that it becomes repetitive and uninteresting and the humor of it all ends very quickly.

Namely his inability to lay off the cheap laughs and toilet humour. Dogma could have been a different, and perhaps even interesting, take on religious issues, but when Jay and Silent Bob are an intricate part of the story it doesn't hold up.All the actors/characters appear like they're doing different films. Damon and Affleck go round on a violent killing spree while discussing their feelings towards God and humanity, Fiorentino looks absolutely bored and uninterested in her serious bits of the film, while Chris Rock, Jay, and Silent Bob do T&A jokes. Dogma definitely looks expensive, and the cast (or parts of it) suggests that it could be quite good, but it never manages to find its tone.Smith's best film is undoubtedly Chasing Amy, in which he managed to do a film that took itself seriously. Sure, Jay and Silent Bob were in that one too, but only in one scene, and even then they didn't act as silly as they normally do. Dogma would have benefited greatly from being severely trimmed down (it feels like it goes on forever) and doing away with the more childish bits.

I thought about it might be better to see the other films of the series first... I don't know why, but I haven't been able to get a hold of any other View Askewniverse(to the uninitiated, those that feature the characters of Jay and Silent Bob) films, so the only two I've seen are this and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. So, I can't really say if this is good compared to the previous films in the series. I've seen the film a few times now... don't know how many exactly, since I've just put it on play a few times while doing other stuff and not paying too much attention to it. So, I've lost track of how many times I've seen it... but I doubt that it's been (attentively) more than three times, this one included. That doesn't sound like much, no? Definitely not too much... so why did I fall asleep during the last fifteen minutes? To make matters worse, I didn't even pay that much attention to it *this* time, either... so what happened? Well, personally I think the problem is the uneventful script... whenever a situation seems to start, a new character is introduced instead of anything actually happening. The viewer has barely picked up who everyone is by the time the film is over... and you know what the problem is? By then, you've stopped caring. Like another reviewer said, there's just too many characters, and as a result, none of them are properly developed or interesting enough to keep you watching. Yes, there is conflict, but it's only introduced once Smith's done pushing every joke or gag that he could possibly come up with for that scene. Now don't get me wrong, I think he has a good sense of humor... maybe even great. Just about any guy can laugh at Jay and Silent Bob. I don't mean to enrage or annoy any fans of Smith here, but I just think he could have done a better job on this. Come on, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was an instantly re-watchable laugh-a-minute film that had no slow moments... why did this one not seem to move at all? The plot is pretty good, but the pacing seemed off. The acting is all good. The characters are well-written but underdeveloped. The humor is very good, at times great. I didn't laugh as much during this movie as I did during Strike Back, but I did laugh... well, the first time I saw it, anyway. The basic idea is pretty good, as well. I might have found it more funny if I wasn't an atheist... but you can't please everybody. A few quick notes on the various actors; both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were good as angels. Linda Fiorentino does an OK job of carrying the movie. Alan Rickman is good as the highest ranking angel. Chris Rock is funny... not just in the movie, he's funny *period*. Salma Hayek is beautiful as always and gives a pretty good performance, though her character here is pretty much the same type of character that she always does. Jason Lee is cool... both in his character and just about every other movie he's done. Of course, Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are awesome in their respective roles of Jay and Silent Bob... but that goes without saying for anyone who's seen them in any of the movies. All in all, probably the least entertaining of the Jay and Silent Bob movies, but not bad. Hey, it's Kevin Smith; he's usually funny... right? I recommend this to fans of Kevin Smith and of the other films in the View Askewniverse, and everyone else who is into this kind of humor.

The movie tells the story of two angels, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) who have been kicked out of heaven by God (Alanis Morissette) and now they make it their quest to return. Doing so, however, will cause everything God has created to be wiped out of existence. While this aspect of the plot is going on, a great grand niece of Jesus, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), and two stoners, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) who seem to be thought of as prophets, are told that they must stop these two angels from completing their task. The good guys are joined by the thirteenth Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock) and the Muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek). It all starts in the late 1990s in Wisconsin, and they all must make their way to New Jersey.Rufus seems to be the character who knows everything and lets everyone know how idiotic they are. In contrast, Jay and Silent Bob just are in it for the adventure . . . and the booty. Bethany plays the part of the innocent girl who has to toughen up and be a hero, but Serendipity is just there for show. While the good guys are recruiting religious-like characters, Loki and Bartleby shoot up a corporate executives' meeting because the two fallen angles felt the need that they should punish a few sinners. When it comes down to the brave, the sadistic, and the cowards, the good guys have to stop the fallen angels from entering a newly found church. Otherwise, it's goodbye to everything in existence.Dogma, in sum, just pokes fun at the Catholic faith. It shows a comical view at a religion which has had many problems in the past. The only lesson possibly noteworthy in this film is that of pride. The majority of religions, including Catholicism, look down on abundant self-pride--hubris. The movie shows that anyone, including angels, should not think of themselves as unstoppable. The fallen angels are full of pride and for that they are punished. In a way, the Roman Catholic Church was full of pride and it was punished as well. The best way to observe this movie is, however, to not look for a morality lesson.

If you don't understand, then just admit it and move on. Critiques should be reserved for anyone who actually made the effort to make sense of what was offered, not for those that felt a pang of discomfort and decided to benchmark it for the rest of the movie.For those not playing with a full deck, the movie is a sarcastic representation of how everyone interprets religion. Opinions vary on the subject and obviously on the movie as well. The fact that the plot centers around faith can cause the viewer to believe that religion is being offended, but remove all religious references and the movie is still offensive. This is dark humor, cynicism and satire at its peak. I daresay that the true villain of the movie is the dogmatic policy that allows the religious elite the right to translate their biblical interpretations into religious law. Aside from Jesus, noone else has ever been given the right of divinity in the Catholic / Christian faith. Moses delivered the commandments, but he did not create or 'write' them. The biggest clue provided is the inability of 'god' to speak to anyone other than an angel without some bloody consequence. We are all supposedly created equal and by that account, if I am unfit to interpret the divine word of 'god', how is anyone else fit for that job? Religion on a whole is its own worst enemy due to its lack of understanding between two individuals or more. 'Dogma' reinforces the idea that it is OK to feel stupid when you don't understand religion, just don't BS if you don't want other people that are just as stupid as you to know that. It doesn't help you and it doesn't help religion since misinterpretation is only one step closer to confusion. After that, frustration and alienation are not far behind. 'Dogma' is neither a critique nor a confirmation of the need for faith and religion. It is show of how extreme behavior can be regarded as harmless until the opposite extreme appears as a balance. Conflict ensues and all can come close to being lost.Consequently, I loved this movie. I am a big fan of dark humor and anything that satirizes religion (some people take it too literal and serious when there really is more to life). Not a masterpiece, but certainly not rubbish. I'm neither a religious fanatic nor a 'gotta have violence and vulgarity' type of person. The movie made its point and was uncompromising about it. If you hated it (after understanding the overall plot), then you simply didn't agree with it. If you loved it (again, after understanding the overall plot), then I suggest you watch it again, just in case. Everybody that didn't understand it, read a book ... actually, read the 'good' book and watch it again.

The rest of this is a fun, insightful if foul mouthed romp that questions the value we place on our beliefs and the more practical alternative of just having ideas. I can see why some people wouldn't like it though, because, as the film points out, if you question religion, you're bound to p*** someone off. Kevin Smith's most daring and probably best film to date.Chris Rock has never been more engaging than he is here as Rufus. Jason Lee was originally supposed to play Matt Damon's role, but had to take a smaller one on account of a schedule conflict.

Contrary to that fact, if you have a low level of hatred and bigotry into you, you'll have to love this movie -I'm afraid that the vast majority of Catholics and more than a half of the other Christians are out this tolerance bracket, and ought to hate it. On the one hand this movie will make laugh your guts out, on the other you have a coherent and well-learned insight into an intolerant, late and heretic sect of Judaism which is a.k.a. Catholicism. I think this movie is too much benevolent on the heresiarchs-followers of Paul who in the First Century underhandedly twisted the teachings of the allegedly Messiah into that anthology of threats and bribery which are the back bone of the church of Rome. Not only some of the dogmas of Catholicism would have been anathematized by the ancient Jews, but by Rabbi Yeshua &#150; Jesus Christ &#150; himself. Of course that If I were a Catholic I would be more comfortable with Mr. Gibson's Gospel of Hatred and Humiliation than what I'm with the Good News brilliantly crafted by Kevin Smith.As far as I know Mr. John Paul II said that the facts on Gibson's movie were accurate - the Pope should have received the green light through the Holly Hot-line, that's for sure. I wonder whether Dogma have been screened to Him. I would love to know His enlightened opinion. I will try to find the exact wording to put it This movie totally, absolutely, thoroughly rocks.

Their banter is worth the movie alone. Add Jason Lee as Loki, and the story really shines.This is actually the second Smith movie I saw, Mallrats being the first. And I enjoyed that one also.

Kevin waited to tackle this project due to its need for a great budget and attention to detail.  He decided to do a couple of other movies first and then put the effort into creating `Dogma.'   This movie is basically about two renegade angels that were kicked out of Heaven and forced to walk the Earth for all eternity.  Ben Affleck & Matt Damon plays these two angels.  They try to find a loophole that would allow them to reenter Paradise.  It won't be that easy because a group of people are on a mission to stop them from accomplishing this task.  That group has two goofs that everyone just can't get enough of, Jay & Silent Bob.  This movie does a great job at making you think.

Anyone who loves Kevin Smith's movies for its lowbrow humor and vulgar dialogue, you will not be disappointed.Due to its `religious' theme, it had its fair share of attacks from religious leagues.  Let me just lay to rest that this movie is not here to bash on Catholic's faith and beliefs, but rather to take all the stories told from all the books and take a stab at telling a story.  Allot of what is told really makes you think and in my opinion when something is able to make you think that is a good thing.  There is nothing about this movie that is anti-religion, if anything it sticks up for religion.  This movie is brought to us by Kevin Smith and the rest of the View Askew gang, who tells us a good story and is not trying to bring us a new revelation.  Don't be fooled by the attacks by some people, who frankly never even saw the movie.  Please just watch and come to your own conclusions.  The only thing I didn't like about this movie was I felt it was way too long.  I guess I was just use to the `normal' length movies Kevin has brought us.

Judge yourself the satanic blasphemies of Dogma- Jesus had brothers and sisters (what a coincidence, last Saturday Gospel talks about them) which are born from the marriage love of Mary and Joseph, just like each of us.- God chooses two amoral and foul-mouthed misfits as prophets (just like many Bible prophets).- There was a 13th black apostle, (I think he is just a disciple who is boasting) who says that Jesus was black (probably He was not, but He had neither the Scandinavian whiteness we represent him with.)- God is a skee-ball fanatic (every American Christian knows that God loves baseball).- God can reveal Himself as a nice and smart-looking girl (Alanis Morrisette). (Are you allowing God to manifest Himself as He likes? Or are you checking the gender of the burning bush? On the other hand, I admit that thinking that God has the bad taste of wearing orange sandals and tartan boxers borders on blasphemy).I think that this film shows Smith's deep faith, even with his usual ironic and laid-down style, and gently mocking some too-literal religious thinking. How many movies have you seen that say that God loves men more than angels, in spit of the evil that men do, and even if some don't believe Him exists? Or  that faith is a gift, not a burden, which has to be celebrated, not mourned? Or that God has a great sense of humour (I's been always sure of it)?The plot is one of the most original I've ever seen; two angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), banished to Earth for having rebelled to God, find a way to regain Heaven; earning a plenary indulgence, on the occasion of the re-consacration of a church. If they'll succeed, they'll proved that God is fallible, and all the Creation will cease to exist. To prevent this, Metatron, the messenger of God (Alan Rickman), appears to a woman (Linda Fiorentino) and asks her to stop them. In this quest the women is helped by the 13th apostle, two prophets (Smith's regular characters Jay e Silent Bob), and a muse (Salma Hayek) who inspired all the highest-grossing movies, except Home alone (`Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get the grosses up on that piece of s***.).Best acting comes from Affleck, whose character evolves smoothly from a calm and sensible guy into a blood-thirsty demon, and Rickman, which keeps an understated tone, and carries both the funniest and the most moving scene in the film (how'd you react if you saw an angel in a pillar of fire in your bedroom? and how do you think Jesus took the news that he was destined to die in deep pain for the redemption of mankind?). I liked also Jason Lee as the elegant devil who wants to undo the Universe.It's not a flawless film Smith delivers the most important messages with monologues that break the rhythm; the biblical slaughter before the ending is justified by the plot, but it has a tone too far from the rest of the film. But it deals in a very original way with an important theme, and makes you both think and laugh, something quite unusual in these days.7/10 "},{"Title":"smart and funny","Date":"6 July 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Dogma was a very well done comedy by the brilliant Kevin Smith, not my favorite Smith work, but still a great film.

It has nothing do with the possible offensiveness of the topic.  I'm not a religious person and therefore have no qualms with someone poking fun at the church.  My reason for not liking...errr hating this movie is due in part to 2 things.  1)It isn't funny and in fact is really really stupid. and 2)People seem to think that Kevin Smith is God.  He could make a movie in which there is no dialogue and the camera records paint drying on the wall, and people will love it if in one or two scenes Jay and Silent Bob walk by and Jay cusses and Bob nods his head or something.  It will be given a standing ovation on it's open night and a generation will preach of it's merrits and brilliance.  When I have talked to people about this movie (yeah I think now adays everyone my age (20) knows at least 1 or 2 die hard Kevin Smith fans) they say Kevin Smith is hilarious.  They don't really have specific reasons and just kind of go along with that assumption.  They sometimes will come up with he is original.  Well so what. Originality is only a merrit if the movie is good or funny!  I mean there is nothing else like Dogma, but that is because no one else wants to make a movie as stupid as Dogma truly is.  It is another one of those movies filled with big names in small parts, trying to make up for it's numerous shortcommings in story and most of all jokes.  Alanis is prehaps the most obvious of these casting choices, but even Selma is wasted in her thankless role.  Yeah she is hot, but who cares that doesn't add anything.  The randomness of the movie is being defended as originality but I'm sorry if I must say that originality doesn't automatically make a good movie, and neither does Kevin Smith...automatically.Zoopansick "},{"Title":"Amazing","Date":"25 June 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Absolutely brilliant.

That girl must do leg presses on a regular basis, as well as spinning classes and a fair amount of treadmill work. Wonder whether she has a trainer. Talk about well-defined! And I'm straight!Now, DOGMA is not the only cultural trope on Milton's Paradise Lost. There's also Philip Pullman's His Dark Instruments trilogy, much more complex and deeply engaging. You can't put that down, I promise you, any more than you can stop watching this movie. Both play with the promising idea of Lucifer, how art thou fallen from heaven! We watched this wonderful flick in bits and pieces interspersed with ghastly commercials on Comedy Channel, the station for losers, as my husband sourly opines. I can't believe I just wrote the word opined...sorry. For that reason I don't have a perfectly cogent grasp of the details, but I will definitely watch this one again. I will do anything to get another look at Alan Rickman flexing his wings, also spitting out his tequila. A lovely sight. I also love the theologically sound vision of God raising the Last Scion from the dead. As a comment, I'm Protestant and have a master's degree in theology. In my view while probably not that of the College of Cardinals, the buggers, this movie not only has dark humor, wonderful performances and satisfying amounts of gratuitous violence sex and racism, it is also theologically sound.Five stars out of six!

The storyline was extremely creative, in Kevin Smith's usual comic-like style, and there was a nice blend of philosophy and camp. However, this movie is NOT quite the brilliant religious opus everyone seems to think it is...It's neither the work of God or Satan-- it's simply a satire that Mark Twain probably would have appreciated.The cast was decent, with a few standouts...and Linda Fiorentino. She's just...flat for some reason, and I had the same problem with her in Men in Black. I have nothing against her, really, but she's not the world's most convincing actress, and that hurts more when she's playing the main character than when she was an unimportant love interest in a buddy film. A better actress might have improved the film somewhat.Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith were...you know, Jay and Silent Bob. Not much to say there. As always, Smith cast his friends, and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did an good job in their roles as Bartleby and Loki, the disgraced angels, particularly Affleck's final scene. He showed more range than I'd given him credit for(I already knew Damon could do it.)Chris Rock is one of the standouts-- the man has extraordinary charisma, and even his poor black man shtick never seems to get old. I was impressed by his skill in a less comedic role.Alan Rickman is brilliant. Is, was, has been, will be...He was as great as the Metatron, Herald of the Almighty, as he is in any of his roles. Maybe Fiorentino would have come off better if so many of her key scenes HADN'T been with Rickman...because the rest of the cast is clearly outshined by the talented Mr. Rickman.

These are the five View Askew movies, the movies directed and written by Kevin Smith. The only other one I had seen before Dogma was Jay and Silent Bob, which was funnier than this one.Linda Fiorentino is Bethany. She works in an abortion clinic and goes to church every Sunday, even though she has lost her faith. Meanwhile, two angels, Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon), who were sentenced out of Heaven, find a loophole that would get them back into Heaven. They see an ad that says that all sins are forgiven when they walk through an archway of a church. So, if they cut off their wings and become mortal, then they will be forgiven and go to Heaven.However, this would lead to the end of the world. Since God is infallible, this would prove God wrong, so the world would end. The Metatron (Alan Rickman), who is the Voice of God, comes to tell Bethany that she is the one who has to stop Bartleby and Loki for reasons she finds out later. Along the way, she meets two prophets Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), the 13th Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock), and another Muse, Serendipity (Salma Hayek), to help her on the quest.Whenever I see a movie and go to write my review, I can always tell if it is going to be a good review or not, and this isn't one. I saw it in pieces, though, so that may be a reason. While Jay and Silent Bob had very raunchy and crude humor, Dogma seemed to stay pretty non-gross-out, with the only exception being the Noman, or, as put by Serendipity, a `sh*t demon'. You can guess what he looks like.All of the actors did their best acting job I've seen them in. Rock didn't seem to go for humor as much in this one, but I didn't find myself laughing too much at this one. He can be a good actor when not making fun of white people or being crude. Jason Lee, who plays another Muse banished to Hell, is great, also. I kept on wishing he were in more of the movie. Mewes was, well, Jay foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed, and maybe a closeted gay. Fiorentino wasn't all that great, but she wasn't in Men in Black also. Affleck isn't a great actor overall, and it shows here. Damon was very good, because he IS a good actor, and so are Rickman and Hayek.Although it isn't plastered with cameos, it does feature a few. George Carlin is a Cardinal, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Holleran (from Clerks) are featured in a few roles, and Alanis Morisette is God (when do you think you'd ever hear that?). Basically, if you're a big fan of other Smith movies, go for it. If you're just a casual fan or not one at all, go with another one.My rating 5/10Rated R for strong language including sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug content.

As one trained in the ministry, and a baby boomer, this movie gives giant clues to all Christians as to why the church on planet earth is ignored today.Written by Kevin Smith, a New Jersey raised producer/ writer, this film uses excessive violence and profanity that makes it an outsider film to most of the church going faithful. The shock value inflicts itself time and again in gory scenes written from the perspective of the world of the Generation X members of America. The interesting parts of the film are the perspectives and questions raised by the characters into the seeming failings of modern religion and or God himself...?There are numerous non sequiturs to any trained clergy who believe in the inspiration of the Scriptures. The movie becomes quite unbelievable in spots...as a for instance... it is clear from the Bible that Jesus must have been a Jewish man on earth. Either that or the whole Bible is so much contrived trash.Kevin Smith is nothing if not a shock value writer and producer as evidenced by other credits as well, such as Good Will Hunting. It is a shame that an otherwise brilliant concept and workable possible comedy is dragged down by buried issues and deep anger within the writer / director himself. I suggest that if Kevin Smith is to gain acceptance in the wider audience of grownups and mature civil audiences, he will have to learn to be less of a head case.That said, I had to watch the movie to probe and note the issues he takes with religion. It is difficult to discuss this without noting the plot, and I do not want to be a spoiler. Suffice it to say, the acting is very good, and the George Carlin segments enjoyable. I would suggest all clergy view this movie, and keep it out of the hands of those under 40 years old.

She is helped along the way by two profits, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), the 13th Apostle named Rufus (Chris Rock) who was unfortunatley left outside of the bible, a muse named Serendipity (Salma Heyek), and the lead angel and voice of god Metatron (Alan Rickman). Bartleby and Loki are also helped by a mean, funny demon named Azrael (Jason Lee). The movie has some interesting twists and is absolutley hilarious. Jay and Silent Bob have the biggest part they have ever had in any of Kevin Smith's films (besides Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). The film also co-stars Brian O'Halloran (who played Dante Hicks in Clerks), Jeff Anderson (who played Randal in Clerks), Janeane Garofolo, Bud Cort and Alanis Morissette as God. For anybody looking for a good comedy rent Dogma.

However, I was shockingly surprised that this film is not only hilarious but is one of the most pro-religion films I have eva seen!Affleck and Damon are brilliant as renegade angels Bartleby and Loki respectively, their double act is polished and funny, making u wonder whether that's what they're really like together. Affleck in particular is brilliantly convincing as Bartleby, becoming slightly manic towards the end and dark.Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) get most of the laughes through Jay's sex-obsessed mind and Smith's almost continued silence. Yet the pair have a type of naive sweetness to them that made this Shadow laugh and made them a lot more appealing as characters. The rest of the characters on their way to stop the angels, Bethany, Rufus and Serendipity work well as a ensemble.Probably best of all is Alan Rickman as angelic messenger Metatron. Rickman is brilliantly dry and witty, his style so different to that of any of the other actors. I sure hope Rickman does more films like this.Smith has done a brillant job in making such a serious subject funny yet not disrespecting it (well not totally!).

One fairy story, the Christian mythology, deserves as much entertaining screen-time as any other fairy story, such as Greek mythology. Anyone who thinks this film provides any new insight into any argument concerning ontology is one book short of a testament. It's just a comic-book story with some novel super-heroes. Enjoy it for what it is. I was laughing almost solidly for the first half of the story! I stopped laughing half way through, and later I worked out why - Alan Rickman was missing. His camp (over camp, he spoils it sometimes) role as Gods messenger, glues the fairly thin plotline together. Chris Rock comes in second place for his faultless job of keeping the movie on its toes. The choice made for God was abysmal, but fortunately God's on-screen for very little time at all, so it doesn't matter much.The film makes digs at lots of people and _lots_ of films - some directly some indirectly. Look out for the Karate Kid reference - that's why I think Rickman _makes_ this movie.Probably the best Smith I've seen, but that's not saying much - all of the other ones I pretty much loathe.If you don't like the movie, or don't find it funny (or both probably), then that's cool, at least you have thought about it.

I love all of his films simply because his dialogue flows so eloquently.  His characters all talk like we wish we could talk all the time.  Witty banter bounces back and forth between characters in his films like tennis balls at a match.  But this movie had something different, something extra.  It is so so dangerous to make a comedy where religion is the focus of humor.  But Smith made not one thing offensive. He tread carefully, and I'm sure bible-thumpers were infuriated to find nothing more offensive than Mooby the Golden Calf, which offended the characters in the film, therefore cancelling itself out and rendering that complaint moot. Having been raised a catholic, I completely agreed with everything this movie pointed out about the idiosynchrasies of religion.  I actually felt like this movie enlightened me.  At a time when I on the brink of atheism, this movie helped point out that it's not God I don't believe in, it's the institute of Catholicism, and it's endless rules and doctrines and hypocrisies.  Anyway, a little off the subject there. I will again reiterate, this movie is pure genius.  Excellent acting by Matt Damon (his scene with the nun and the Alice in Wonderland analogy was perfectly executed).  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both know exactly how to deliver Smith's dialogue.  Selma Hayek was superb as the uber-intellectual ex-muse.  And Chris Rock as Rufus the forgotten apostle was priceless.

DeMille and George Stevens, have shown great REVERENCE for God.  Others have shown disrescpect.  Independent filmmaker Kevin Smith is the only one, in my experience, to actually show AFFECTION for God!  ***(SPOILERS AHEAD)***DOGMA hits great highs and lows.  On the high side, two of the most beautiful speeches ever filmed are made to Bethany, the Last Scion, by the Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock) and the Voice of God (Alan Rickman) in the middle of the movie, both concerning the poignant terribleness of having to tell a twelve-year-old boy--Jesus of Nazareth--that he bore the responsibility of living the life of the Lord and Savior of Mankind, up to and including a painful and degrading death.  On the other hand, there are scenes of such vulgarity that they're really and truly hard to watch, the worst of these, of course, being the one featuring the Excremental, or the S**t Demon--but then, this scene is somewhat redeemed by the Muse's explanation of the Demon's nature (composed of bodily wastes of criminals crucified on Golgotha), which has the same pseudo-logical tone as most authentic (?) dogma.And, of course, I could f*****g take issue with a whole f*****g lot of the f*****g language, especially when f*****g Jason Mewes is doing the f*****g talking.  But f**k it.DOGMA is not for the faint of heart, or for the faint of faith.  Kevin Smith believes as least two things about God, or Jehovah, or Allah, or Man Above (an Arapaho appellation I especially like) that I do, and these beliefs inform the entire film     1.  GOD IS PLAYFUL.       2.  GOD IS FALLIBLE.  These two statements, verging on blasphemy to those who would rather believe than think, go a long way towards explaining the fanatic hostility that has greeted this very funny and wonderfully acted film from certain quarters.  If you have no problem with these two ideas, then you'll probably love this film.  Kudos to Kev Smith for having the humor, the perception, and the courage to make it.

Because underneath all the cussing, and sex jokes, religion bashing and...everything else, this movie does have quite an interesting point. That presumably BELIEFS are what causes all the misdeeds of humans in the world. And isn't that true in a sense? People can change an idea, but a belief! Heavens no! Anyway, onto the movie.First off, this is the first Kevin Smith film I've had the honor of viewing. The movie was able to intelligently cross comedy with the forbidden aspect of religion. And trust me, as Mr. Smith says in the beginning of the film, DO NOT TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY!!! Just listen to the dialogue between the characters! Look at the unique plot that was thought up! This is THE comedy for the modern generation! And maybe for the older ones too if you just let go and have fun.Of course, the main attractor for me was the ever wonderful Matt Damon and his buddy Ben Affleck. These two made spectacular killer angels trying to get back into heaven. Bethany, played by Linda Fiorentino, plays the last cion, sent on a holy crusade to prevent Loki and Bartleby from entering the loophole which will send them home to heaven and thus negating all existence as said by Metatron played by Alan Rickman. Of course, Bethany can't do this crusade alone. Oh no, she needs help, which she gains from two prophets, the 13th apostle, and a muse. The two prophets are Jay and Silent Bob. Jay being the all cussing, all sex wanting, kind of gay one and Silent Bob&#133;well his name says it all. The forgotten 13th apostle is Rufus, who was left out of scripture because he was black. And the muse, Serendipity, who wanted to make it big on earth, but gets writer's block. Poor baby.This movie is quite educational for a comedy. At least, I thought so. You might too. Who knew about Metatron before watching this movie? Who could think that a BELIEF and not an IDEA could cause so much pain in the world? That God indeed could be a woman? You know what? I think you should see this movie! And now I wish to see the other brilliant Kevin Smith films. If they are even as remotely funny as Dogma was, then wow. This is recommended!!! By a girl!

The two angels, who are determined to get back into Heaven, are desperate enough to try it. The only problem is that them going back into Heaven would show a flaw in God's (Alanis Morresate) plan and would erase all of existense. With God no where to be found, Metatron (Rickman) finds the last Scion (Fiorentino) who is working in an abortion clinic in Illinois. Others that help are the over looked 13th apostle Rufus (Rock), the stoner prophets Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), and the stripper Muse Serendipity (Hayek). The casting was great. Although Fiorentino's performance was a LITTLE weak, I still can't picture anyone else playing Bethany. Alan Rickman rocked, as he usually does.

It is also full of dick and fat jokes that are just fun.I am now no longer a Christian (not because of this film), but have a fair knowledge of Christianity, and I believe that this film is sincere about faith, and not trying to mock it.  To think that it is blasphemous is ridiculous. At no point does the film suggest that God does not exist, or that Christian morals are wrong.  It makes a simple point of questioning how Christians worship, not whether what they worship is incorrect.  If it offends you, then good.  You need to expand your perspective and accept that your vision or understanding of Christianity might not be perfect, or even well thought through.Kevin Smith takes nothing for granted.  He lets you know that just because its in the Bible, it does not mean that it is correct.  This is not blasphemous, it is intelligent.Anyway.  I am a big fan of this film.  I think everyone should see it to get a better understanding of modern Christianity, and also to laugh at the s**t, f**k and d**k jokes.  I will defend it against narrow-minded fools for ever.

Forget the minor inconsistencies in plot and religious detail, this film manages to do several things and does them well.It gives the concept of organised religion and the things it advocates and those that are done in its name a well-timed, well-aimed boot up the clacker.  It points a finger at the stupidities, the ridiculosities and the absurdities of religion and does it oh so well.But ultimately it says, 'Hey, when you strip away the veneer and the accoutrements, there really is an underlying truth and a message that transcends all the window-dressing and embellishment that's worth bending an ear in the direction of'.For the record, I'm agnostic and DO NOT bend an ear that way, but I really respect the fact that Smith added that reverent touch.Do yourself one hell of a favour and see this film, ideally with a very open mind.P.S.

Neither religious or life after death stuff does not hold enough credibility for me to be material for good movies. However 'Dogma' starts clever enough, it has vivid dialogue, and for much of the time the god acting and the parody line compensates the main moral line of the story. Unfortunately the opportunity for a very good movie is lost when the script seems to take the religious material seriously, and when graphical violence (at the limit of being disgusting) makes its way - probably trying to compensate the too moral line that the story has taken by the last third of the movie.

Although Lee and Rickman are more of characters you sorta forget and remember once they come back and you're glad they are. Anyway, that's just part of the greatness. The writing by Kevin Smith is sharp, very witty, and handles all of the possibly touchy issues with grace. And anybody who says Smith has a lack of visual talent, should just wait for one part midway through the movie. That will cancel that. Also, how could I forget the rest of the cast.

Now the concept of a movie that makes fun of religion to me is a great thing (look at Monty Pythons life of Brian, a Classic) although i dont think that was the general idea. but in this film there are some great soundbites about organised religion such as Trust the catholics to destroy existance,I have a problem with anyone who treats god as a burden instead of a blessing like some catholics , you people dont celebrate your faith you mourn it!

However, as with everything, there are consequences. In this case, their re-entry will prove God wrong, and thus unmake existence. Of course, this cannot be allowed, so the Last Scion (Linda Fiorentino) is tapped to stop this atrocity, with the help of some unlikely companions (Jay and Silent Bob - the stoner prophets, Chris Rock as Rufus the 13th Apostle, etc.)Warning You must have an open mind to enjoy this movie! If you are narrow-minded or easily offended, you'll be on the list of those who hate it. Skip it and watch a Disney movie or something.For those of you who can handle new ideas and aren't offended by reality and sex and stuff - this is an awesome movie! I saw this and had to go back and watch Clerks and Mallrats and Chasing Amy - and I can't wait to see Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back! I only wish I had caught them earlier - it makes me sad that I didn't until right before Kevin Smith has decided to retire Jay and Silent Bob. But it's ok - I can watch his movies over and over - especially Clerks and Dogma.I'm not saying there aren't flaws in this or any other Kevin Smith movie. There are. There are mistakes and inconsistencies and sometimes some pretty bad acting, but it doesn't matter to me, and I figure that Kevin Smith knows it won't matter to those who truly appreciate his movies and that we'll forgive him - which I do wholeheartedly.I know Dogma offends a lot of people - particularly those of the Catholic persuasion. But it's pretty much inevitable that one will offend someone when one sets out to challenge or question a popular set of beliefs. As for me, I'm almost impossible to offend, so I love it! It raises questions that I've always had myself. I haven't followed any specific religion since I outgrew the 'Mommy says it's this way so it must be' phase of life. Personally I think they are very important questions that should be considered by those who would like to reach a clearer understanding of life, the universe and everything. For exampleWhy is it that people insist on burdening their deity with a gender? I mean, there are fish that can change their gender, animals whose offspring's gender depends on the temperature during the time they're in the egg, and people who change sex at will if they can afford it. Gender is not an immutable fact. Why would an all-powerful deity be limited by it and why should it matter? Same with race - was Jesus white? black? who cares?! - is Michael Jackson white? black? who cares?! - it shouldn't matter!Also in the male vs female category, the question is raised of why women are given such a bad name in the Christian Bible. Almost all of them are just plain wicked - Eve causes the fall of man, Delilah brings about the downfall of Samson. The good women in the Bible are the ones who quietly obey their husbands without question. Coincidentally, the Bible was written by men - hmmmmmmmm.A lot of people seem to have a problem with Dogma's lesson that ideas are better than beliefs. I understand this to mean (and I agree) that adhering to a strict system of beliefs put upon you by an institution (the Catholic church for example) closes your mind to other options and ideas. Anything that doesn't fit into that belief system is immediately pushed aside as wrong - it is dismissed. How can you discover the truth if you can't examine all possible answers without bias? You can't.I could probably continue this rant for a long time, so I'll stop now. I'll just say again that I love this movie and I love Jay and Silent Bob. I know a lot of people don't get them, but I think they're worth getting to know. Those who don't understand them should watch Clerks, where Randal mentions that Jay is the only one of the bunch who knows who and what he is and doesn't pretend to anything else (not an exact quote, but the gist as I got it). And Silent Bob doesn't need to say much - he's already saying it all - he's Kevin Smith!

When a film is written and directed by the same person it gives the film a unique flavour because the story is told through the eyes of the author and not some director with a budget.  Another reason for the film being so fantastic is because it challenges and questions the greatest story ever told, The Bible! The bible may only be a story that has no true what so ever behind it, but billions of people all over the world believe and even live by it. Dogma challenges some of the main characters of the Bible like God may be a woman and whether Jesus was black. The only other film I can think of that takes the Bible and makes a comedy out of it is 'Monty Pythons Life of Brian'Dogma is about two angels that were banished from heaven by God who find a loop hole to get back into heaven. If the angels get back into heaven then everything God has Created will be reversed, the whole of mankind will disappear. So a descendant of Jesus is sent along with two 'prophets' to stop them before they prove Gods infallible and end existence!Dogma, a thought provoking comedy, not to be missed!!!

The movie starts off with a bunch of hilarious gags yet in the second hour or so there are very few laughs. I found the movie to be a bit too confusing for a Kevin Smith movie and not very well made.

Linda Fiorentino is perfect as Catholic that's lost her faith, and Chris Rock gives his best acting job in this movie. While he is a loudmouth, he also has a more thoughtful side, as the 13th apostle( left out of the Bible because he was black ). I don't really like Damon or Affleck ( they sound like they should be in a Tarantino film ) but they generated sympathy as two exiled angels merely wanting to go home. Alan Rickman was my favorite actor though( in a minor role ) as Metatron, the Voice of God. His exaggerated English accent, and hungover-type angel persona was the best character in the movie.

But I actually went in expecting to enjoy this movie. Great cast and a great concept! Unfortunately, the movie was as preachy as it was funny, which negated the humour much of the time. I felt like I was watching a movie pushing religious theology that was cleverly concealed as a comedy. They could have made the same references without constantly having to explain to the audience why they're right and you're wrong and pulled it off much better. What hurts most is seeing how much potential this movie had and knowing that it didn't just miss the boat, it didn't even make it to the dock. As it stands, the script was sorely self-destructive and seemed like it was made mainly with trying to force someone's own religious ideals rather than really trying to entertain. I didn't really find it offensive, although I can understand how some may see it as such. It was simply that it felt like an am-way party where you get duped into going, thinking its a real party, and sure, they throw a few treats to add to the party atmosphere but you're really just there to get sold something. And Linda Fiorentino's acting was TERRIBLE in this movie! And in such a prominent role, it really stood out. I think she ruined the movie more than the preaching. I thought she was somewhat blase in Men in Black but in this movie, you just get the feeling the whole time that she's not really trying or that her mind is elsewhere. I wouldn't normally make such a big deal of someone's acting but she was the female LEAD. Save for Chris Rock, whose display revealed his comedy strength is NOT following a script word for word, everyone else did a terrific job.So again, if you aren't easily offended by religious comedy and can easily get passed the sell job, go for it.

Slent Bob and Jay are very funny in small roles (i.e. Chasing Amy) but when they are given as much airtime as they are in Dogma, they grow tiresome pretty quickly.

It pokes fun at organized religion, especially the mother Christian faith, Catholicism.  Right away you know it is a comedy because of the premise - two fallen angels exiled to Wisconsin who think they find a loophole that will get them back into heaven.  A cute premise, and in perhaps 25% of the film is handled in a very entertaining way.However, the film, I feel, makes quite a few blunders of style.  There are several very bloody scenes where people get beaten and/or shot and killed, that are not funny at all, and seem unnecessary to achieve the director/writer's goals.The casting of George Carlin as a cardinal, an outspoken critic of organized religion, didn't work for me.  The rampant explicit talk of sexual intercourse, of references to sex with biblical figures, the over-use of foul language, all to me represent errors in writing and directoral judgement for this type of film.  Unless the intent was to insult a large fraction of the viewing audience.Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, again, were great as buddies. I thought Linda Fiorentino as the last scion was well-cast. My very favorite was the British Alan Rickman as God's spokesman. He played that part perfectly.There were quite a few sight gags that had us laughing - the feces man who came out of the toilet, the occasional person dropping out of the sky, the angel dropping his pants to show he had no sex organs, stuff like that did not cross the line from funny to poor taste.  The premise, for a comedy, was absolutely great, and with more careful scripting and directing this could have been, for me, a 10.  I definitely would *not* recommend this film for anyone sensitive about thier religious beliefs, because if you are then it will insult you.  If you have an open mind, you can enjoy the 25% to 50% of this movie which is really well-done.

Who else has made a career not only in spite of, but perhaps because of, such sloppy filmmaking?  At least you could excuse the poor acting and wordy, precious dialogue of Clerks as the efforts of a low-budget rising indie filmmaker.  For all of its flaws, it was a charming, fun movie, with memorable lines and Hey-I-know-guys-just-like-that! realism to it.But years later, with a major league budget, Smith is making many of the same mistakes, and nobody is telling him it's wrong!  Dogma is just as verbose and self-satisfied, the characters are just as thinly drawn, and even the best of Hollywood actors (Matt Damon!  Linda Fiorentino!  Alan Rickman!) can't keep the pace from plodding.  Particularly annoying was Kevin, his own cutesy, camera-mugging self as Silent Bob -- his inability to see his own overacting (in a mute role!) pretty much personifies the lack of awareness and discipline of Dogma as a film.  I am appalled that so many people have such allegiance to Kevin Smith because of a soft spot for comic-book/pop-culture references.  It's one thing to like a guy for liking the same movies you do; it's another to confuse it with an understanding of the craft itself.As you can tell, this movie actually makes me a little angry in retrospect.  But while I was watching it in the theater, the strongest feeling I had was boredom.  The story was flat, and the only thing the characters could do was talk, talk, talk.  This might have been a mildly interesting 1 1/2 hour movie with a good script doctor and an objective editor, but it would seem Mr. Smith has too much pride and/or too much creative control to cut any extraneous words or frames.  For example, as much as I love to look at Salma Hayek, her character didn't need to be there.  Nor did a monster made entirely of excrement, who appears and dies in the same scene, for no reason, with no purpose, other than to be disgusting.Okay, there were a couple of laughs, most notably delivered by two of the more believable characters, Rufus (Chris Rock) and Jay (Jason Mewes).

IMO, he made a movie that does point out the hypocrisies and follies of all religions, not just Catholicism, but also makes a good point about the importance of faith. It's not important what your faith is. What's important is that you have faith. I actually walked out of the theater feeling uplifted. And I'm an agnostic.While it's a good movie, this flick does have some flaws. Two of the biggest are called Jay and Silent Bob. Now I love J&SB, but I really don't think they needed to be this movie. Sure, they were funny, but I think the film overall would have been better without them.My other complaint is that so much stuff got left out. Like a lot of Kevin Smith fans I read the script for Dogma on the net way before it got to the theaters. Rufus' story about Mary and Joseph's sex life, and the Fat Albert scene didn't make the final cut. Which is a real shame since those were some of the funniest stuff in the script.Overall, this is a good movie. It does what a good satire should it makes you laugh and think at the same time.

However, being ground-breaking or different doesn't necessarily mean it's good. This is Kevin Smith's best film by far although I don't think that's saying much. My problem with the movie is the same problem the movie has with religious activists STOP TAKING YOURSELF SO SERIOUSLY!! Dogma doesn't quite know whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama and being stuck in the middle really kills the point. Had this been an all tongue-in-cheek comedy, it would have been great. But it gets caught up in trying to make sense out of it's own myth while it's making fun of the nonsense of every other biblical allusion, and the movie ends up contradicting itself in this way.The second point I'd make about it is IT'S WAY TOO LONG! Cut out some material. I don't care if you make the plot ridiculous or complex (that's religion). But by the end you feel like you've been preached at not to preach. It's like telling somebody they need to lighten up while you're smoking a cigarette and popping a valium on two hours of sleep. You look like a hypocrite.I will say that Smith has finally learned a little bit about subtlety, but he's a long way from using it consistently. The When are we going to f**k? jokes are so tired in his movies. That was about 45 minutes of this film. Cut it out! PLEASE!! You had something to work with on this one and you blew it. I will say the acting was great. Affleck, Damon, the whole cast. It's particularly tough trying to deliver some of Smith's dumb-downed, gen-x insulting, overdone cliché references too. The cast did a great job with what they had to work with. But overall it was a great idea with a poor, ill-conceived script. I can't wait for his NEXT film though and I can't believe I'm saying that.

I got so annoyed with Clerks that I walked out before the end, and when I did stay for the end of Chasing Amy I wished I hadn't, it was so beyond contrived.  Dogma was the first of Smith's films that I actually liked, but some of the worshipful reviews I've read of it are just plain disturbing.Smith likes to try to shock us, usually with what another comment on this site referred to as dick and fart jokes.  The effective moments of Dogma saw the characters thinking within the logic of Catholicism as presented by the movie and producing problems and jokes from within that space (for example, Jay's response after Rufus has painstakingly elaborated Fiorentino's divine heritage So, she's black?  That was a perfect one that registered the biggest laugh of the night with the audience I was in). The far more prevalent moments were simple applications of the tired dick and fart jokes to new targets, be it the Church, organized religion in general, etc.  When the film first does this, it rightly offsets the seriousness and grandeur of the religious, but when the film does this for TWO HOURS STRAIGHT, I get a little bored, a little annoyed that Smith doesn't seem to know when he's made his point.  So he just keeps on making it, and keeps on making it.  And I quit finding it funny.Fiorentino was woefully misused, cracking sarcasms when she should be full of curiosity, fear and trembling, rendering her otherwise beautiful moment of self-doubt utterly unbelievable and unmotivated (and almost, well, hokey), but the Wonder Bread Boys Damon and Affleck are actually really good, as is Rickman.One final word to those who see in Dogma a critique of organized religion Let's not forget that this supposed critique is a film whose very premise (articulated by Loki and Bartleby themselves, at the movie's outset in the airport) is that the Catholic Church speaks for God.  Can you critique as outmoded and fallen an institution whose very status as divine authority is required by the plot structure of your critique?  I don't think it works.Let's see Dogma for what it is, a pretty good comedy.  But let's not fall into the sandtrap of calling a movie deep just because it talks its way around religion.  Other films have engaged religion far more credibly, and those are the asses we should be kissing.

Chris Rock is hilarious as usual, and Smith even found a way to give his character a reason to rant about white people. Alan Rickman's sarcastic presentation of Metatron (the voice of God) perfectly and hilariously wreaks of someone who's sick of talking to brainless humans to deliver God's messages.It's all packaged up nicely via Kevin Smith's near-perfect cartoon-like pacing that never leaves you bored. Affleck and Damon's natural repoir is entertaining as usual, as is the beautiful and funny Salma Hayek. Linda Fiorentino's character (while also beautiful) was a bit tired and one-dimensional, but maybe that was necessary in this case, to give the other characters something to poke fun at and wise off to.The message of this movie is truly outstanding. It can be boiled down to God has a sense of humor (this is even displayed in a disclaimer in the beginning of the movie). This statement in itself is a very permeating, unique, and even comforting outlook on life. I don't believe in God myself, but I have to say, this movie's interpretation of the nature of God is the most attractive I've seen yet. If Kevin Smith started a religion, I just might join.If you have no sense of humor when it comes to god, you're bound to be offended.

(What's that you say? It's not anti-Catholic? K.Smith is religious himself? My, my...don't kid a kidder and let's not kid ourselves, OK?). But, humans ain't the only ones flawed in this pic; in K.Smith's world-view, Angels are seriously messed-up characters also. And the whole plot hinges on the 'fact' that even God can make errors 2 outcast Angels, Bartleby & Loki (Loki? - didn't he fight Thor?), find a loophole in God's laws, which would allow them back into Heaven. Thing is, if they succeed in this, all of existence - predicated on God's flawlessness - would be erased. Thus, Smith's follow-up to his New Jersey trilogy about slackers has a genuine apocalyptic threat running in it. K.Smith himself and sidekick Jason Mewes reprise their roles as Jay & Silent Bob in helping various 'good' knights thwart the ultimate evil plan (orchestrated by another fallen angel, Azrael aka Jason Lee). This works as a comedy, and Smith throws in a lot of concepts you don't normally see piled on in just one movie, as well as some observations designed to embarrass the Catholic regime (such as, the church's convenient tolerance of slavery in the old days). So, this is ...what? - a religious, political, social commentary all rolled into one? Yeah, I guess, and things even take a dark turn near the end, with mass killing. Take warning, also, that Smith's characters are usually all foul-mouthed to the extreme. But, the central character, played by Fiorentino, is the most decent of the bunch, and carries the show with a fully-rounded performance not resorting to shtick or dogma (interesting that she's the actress K.Smith didn't get along with). When half the characters are Angels of one sort or another, it's no surprise that a kind of preaching tone permeates the script - a young, liberal 'live and let live' tone. But, on the other hand, a lot of it does make sense. In that slacker, New Jersey kind-of fashion. Next up Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back(2001).

Pick something controversial so that you will attract viewers who will watch it for the subject matter rather than the overrated credentials of the director/ writer. Ps Include lots of plot holes and about 1200 underdeveloped main characters. 2)Thenyou need a poorly written and overlong script. I strongly advise lots of unnecessary cursing and overlong religious babbling. The cursing will appeal to the thirteen year old boys and the babbling will appeal to their pseudo-intellectual older sisters/ brothers. 3)Next you need a director. Smith clearly chose to do this himself because only he could fully understand the epic scope that he envisioned for his movie. Or,more likely, he knew that he wanted to act in this claptrap, and he knew no other director would cast him. Not even as police man #8. If this is not true and he actually did want to direct then why does this movie have no direction. 4) Get an A-list of top-tier actors to appear.Wasted talent such as Matt Damon (and to a lesser extent Ben Affleck),Salma Hayek (the reason the 13 year old boys got the movie), AlanRickman (why's he dressed like he plays in a skater band?) even, ChrisRock and the legendary George Carlin, though not great actors are the 2best comedians of all time. I figured they could see when a script justisn't funny. Casting good actors is typically a good idea unless the movie is so bad that it angers their fans. As for Linda Fiorentino Isee no reason why Smith would place all of these actors around such awooden, unenthused leading lady. One thing I'll give Smith is that he gave himself and Alanis Morrisette 3 lines between them, which still proved to be more than they could handle. As for Jay? Jay should be shot in the head on national television. What an annoying character. 5)I'm not a very religious person but even i was offended that God dressed in something that would make David Bowie sick to his stomach. Hey God, Rob Rodie wants his jacket back. 6)Jason Lee as a bad guy. His overacting makes him almost as intimidating as those kids that threwcrabapples at my car. Next Smith will cast Jimmy Fallon as Idi Amin. 7)Building up bad guys only to have them die in ridiculous, embarrassing ways. Shoving the hockey kids heads into recently blessed holy water? Hitting Scout Leader Lee with a blessed golf club? Spraying the sh*t monster with Odor spray? All ridiculous ideas. And did you notice that even though there are millions of good guys in the script Smith has his character kill 2 of the main bad guys.

Cardinal Glick (George Carlin) is revitalizing the church and rededicates St. Michael's Church in New Jersey. The papal sanctioned entrance allows all those who enter to have their sins forgiven. The two angels need to walk through the archway and then die to reenter Heaven. Catholic Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) works at an abortion clinic and is struggling for faith. She is tasked by the angel Metatron (Alan Rickman), the voice of God, to stop the two angels or else it could undo all of God's work. To help her, he sends her two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). Azrael (Jason Lee) and his hockey playing goons try to stop her. Along the way, they are aided by the 13th Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock) and the muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek).There are just so much religious exposition. It probably took up half of movie to explain who these characters are and what they represent. Towards the end, the whole thing gave me a headache. I think it is something very compelling for Catholics but less so for most everybody else. I guess all the complicated history is part of Kevin Smith's commentary on the religion.Some of the movie is more fun than other. I love Jay and Silent Bob. They're funny in this movie. Linda Fiorentino is a little dour but she's still pretty good as the lead. I got bored with the Damon Affleck massacre tour. It's not funny or compelling. The road trip works in the first half with some fun introductions of Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. The second half gets bog down from time to time.

I have heard a lot about Smith, and up until last night I had only had a glimpse of his comedy Mallrats (1995). Now I have seen Dogma, one of the most wickedly funny - and strange - satires in recent memory.The plot Two fallen angels named Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) figure out a way to get back into heaven via a loophole involving a Catholic church. However, God decreed that they shall be sent to earth for eternity, and therefore, if they find a way into heaven, it will negate something God commanded, therefore destroying the world.And so the last Zion (relative of Christ), Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), is sent on a mission by a strange angel (Alan Rickman) who says she will meet two rather unconventional prophets traveling to New Jersey (where the church is located). She must stop Bartleby and Loki from entering heaven before they unknowingly destroy the world.Her unconventional prophets are two strange men, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). Jay is a foul-mouthed idiot and Silent Bob is a silent idiot. Fans of Smith will remember these characters from previous films - they even got their own movie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).Along her journey, Bethany encounters an odd assortment of characters, including the 13th prophet, Rufus (Chris Rock), who was not mentioned in the Bible because he was black; Cardinal Glick (George Carlin), a New Age priest; Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a fallen angel who has become a stripper (even though angels have no genitalia); and God (Alanis Morrisette), no introduction necessary, but rather the fact that (S)he is a woman and not a man.Being from a Christian background I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I was extremely surprised. It isn't as offending as I thought it would be. In fact, there are in-jokes that only those familiar with the Bible would pick up on in the first place. Catholics protested against this film when it first came out - something Kevin Smith probably predicted well in advance since he has a scene where Catholic protesters are rallying on a street.There are some genuinely original, wacky and wickedly funny moments in Dogma, but the longer the film treads on (two hours +), the less impact the more stretched-out jokes become. The film sorta loses itself in some way towards the end, picking up a kind of Charlie Kaufman weird ending involving Bartleby flying around killing people outside the Catholic Church in NJ. I think that this haphazard strangeness is great in one way, but in another I think it loses its comedy, and stretches out a bit too much. I was ready to give it 5 stars until the last twenty minutes, simply because I think no wacky comedy should exceed two hours; an hour and a half can be stretching it sometimes.Dogma is a splendidly, unexpectedly violent and hilarious and satirical and truly smart comedy that successfully accomplishes what it set out to do Spoof religion. The jokes do start to get worse and worse as the film goes on, but the first 3/4 of the movie was pure joy to sit through. I watched the film by myself and laughed - something I don't usually do when no one else is around, for some reason - and that just shows how much impact it had on me.The first sign of Kevin Smith's insight into religion is the unveiling of the new Catholic Christ. Cardinal Glick reveals to the press that the church folk think the image of Jesus hanging on a cross is too depressing - so he whips out Buddy Jesus, a statue of Jesus giving a thumbs-up that looks as if it belongs in a casino in Las Vegas. These are the best moments in the movie - when Smith is really lampooning the fact that Catholicism is becoming more commercialized every day. (No offense to the Catholics out there.)I also appreciated the in-joke about John Hughes. Jay and Silent Bob admit to Bethany that they came to Illinois to live in Shermer, the place most of John Hughes' movies take place in. They say that the women are always beautiful and the guys are always nerds, so it's the perfect place for them. Then they confess that they found out there isn't really a Shermer, Illionis, and curse the movies for tricking them. Only a Hughes fan would understand.Speaking of Hughes for a moment, Kevin Smith's band of return actors - including Mewes, Rock, Affleck, Damon, Jason Lee (who plays a demon named Azrael here), and himself - are named View Askew. John Hughes was primarily responsible for the birth of the Brat Pack during the eighties. No doubt in my mind exists that Kevin Smith is truly following in the footsteps of his self-proclaimed role model - ten years from now we'll probably be looking back at the nineties as the View Askew Pack.Best moment When Loki murders the board members of a greedy corporation and spares one woman because he says she is innocent. Then he says that she forgot to say, God bless you when he sneezed moments before and so he's ready to kill her. You got off easy, he says. You've got to see the scene to understand it, much like the entire film.

However this would prove God wrong and would reverse creation itself.  A distant relative of Jesus (Fiorentino) is commanded by Metatron (Alan Rickman) to stop the two angels from entering the arch.  She sets off accompanied by two prophets (Mewes and Smith), an apostle (Chris Rock) and a muse (Salma Hayek) for a trip of faith.This is another of Smith New Jersey series and his second that mixes a more mature subject with comedy (the first being Chasing Amy).  As a big fan of all Smith's work, I was looking forward to seeing this for the comedy rather than any theological points it may have.  I was a little disappointed in it and I'll tell you why.The plot is good.  It didn't need to be brilliant (Clerks and Mallrats prove what can be done with nothing!) as long as the comedy is sharp.  The main weakness is that the theological stuff doesn't sit totally comfortably with the comedy.  It is fine for the most part (in fact some of the comedy makes the religious questioning easier to take) but some of the time it takes away from the laughs and slows things down.  The end result is that it isn't as funny as I wanted it to be.  Having said that some of the points do make you think about Christianity but most are silly - Smith poking fun rather than making a point (God holidaying in human form? An apostle left out because he was black? Muse's from heaven?).  They're funny yes, but if he's trying to make a serious point then he's way off track.The performances are great.  The cast is amazing in terms of star names, with people falling over themselves to work with Smith.  Affleck and Damon are good as the angels, both having fun in their roles.  Affleck doesn't quite convince in the last 45 minutes where he becomes more angry and serious but before that is good.  Linda Fiorentino is good in the lead role as the woman who has lost her faith, but once she gets involved with the story she comes across like she's not part of the story and is sitting somewhere having a debate rather than living it.  Rock is the funniest as the black apostle who gets all the best lines.  Rickman is good but overplays the grumbling English side of his character.  Alanis Morissette seems to be cast as God just to annoy the Catholics and doesn't really have anything to do other than be kooky in the last 5 minutes.  And, having been given the role of roles as Brody in Mallrats, and the possessor of The Best Lines in Chasing Amy, Jason Lee is given a minor role as the lead demon, but doesn't get the chance to shine as he previously has had.As always Jay and Silent Bob are allowed full reign to inhabit their own little dirty bit of the movie.  Personally I find Jay's dirty humour very funny, but if you don't then he may put you off the rest of the movie.  Some of their humour is too toilet related to sit with the religious comedy, but most of it is fine.The majority of serious points are stupid and don't make sense.  Some make you think but this vision of the Bible is not exactly Last Temptation of Christ in terms of reasoned argument.  Overall this is a funny film, it is also another step on the road away from Clerks towards a more structured story-telling.  It's good that Smith hasn't started taking himself seriously yet (as shown in the opening disclaimer and the closing credits) and this causes the whole film to have a throwaway comedic feel.

As a comedy, it is not funny except in a few places with broad bathroom humor. The acting is awful among a rotund list of bad performances, Selma Hayek gives her worst. The characters are painful cliches.As a theological inquiry, it is embarrassingly uninformed and cliched as well. If Smith was earnestly trying to ask provocative questions in this movie, he came across with only the most worn and trite junior college contentions imaginable. Jesus is black; God is a woman; the bible was rewritten over the centuries by the powers that be; the first two of these thoughts bespeak a notably less-than-sophisticated attempt to question Christianity and the last seems utterly obvious to anyone who has given the matter any thought. I cannot imagine that anyone would find this movie to be thought-provoking unless they have never done much thinking.It is as though Smith wanted people to watch his movie, but could not get attention by making a good one, so he lined up as many cheap shots against a popular religion as possible in order to get some attention. There are many criticisms to make of Christianity that deserve to be made, but they should be made intelligently, not with humor only fit for a child or a pot head. Lest anyone accuse me of taking what is supposed to be a light hearted, amusing romp too seriously If one is going to try hard to critique a religion as ancient and venerable as the one Smith seems to be trying to critique, I'm afraid that religion deserves a cleverer, more sophisticated, more informed attack, not a quick skim through Elaine Pagels or Merlin Stone's When God Was a Woman. Regardless of your opinion towards the follies of Christianity, an institution of this age and grandeur requires an attack of comparable grandeur, not a cheap, intellectually impoverished marijuana movie with feces guns and feces demons. You cannot try to make a light-hearted movie that takes as many shots as Dogma does against Christianity and hope to evade the annoyance of persons who have actually earnestly studied the history of religions. Was Smith simply having fun? Did he not mean this movie to be serious? I've toyed with this possibility. If so, he certainly threw a lot of effort into trying very very hard to be subversive.  Regardless of his intent, the result is an amateurish and sophomoric, rather Oedipal attempt to destroy an authority figure that doesn't have that much power anymore anyway. If you want to see a movie that has an actually clever, well-done critique of Christianity, try The Wicker Man; if you want to see a movie that explores the theme of angels who are immortal and must watch human sufferings and follies, try Wings of Desire.

How many times did 5 or 6 characters just sit around explaining elaborate supernatural rules to each other? That might have been funny if the script were well written and if Selma Hayek could act just a little, but it wasn't. And poor Ben Affleck, trying to act up a storm was this supposed to be dramatic? It was just out of place and dumb. And Alanis Morrisette as God might have been funny if all the reviews hadn't revealed this plot point and if George Burns hadn't already milked the joke of an unlikely pop celebrity as God years ago. I was horribly bored at this movie and may have set a record for times I looked at my watch. Thinking a comedy should be about 90 minutes, I went nuts waiting for this ponderous two hours to end.

I was, however, bitterly disappointed in the final result.There were certainly some good one-liners in the film, and I did laugh out loud more than once.  The premise itself was humorous, and had a lot of potential.  Even so, the end product fell fall short of quality movie making.The script simply dragged.  The plot kept getting more and more complicated with no benefit to the overall story.  New characters were continually introduced for no better reason than to give big name actors a role in the movie.  With each new character came a new mythical label a fallen angel, a demon, a muse.  It's as though having a hip station in the afterlife was an appropriate substitute for thoughtful screen writing.  For the most part, these characters contributed nothing to the piece other than a few diverting one-liners and allowed the producers to put marketable names on the marquee.Another problem I had with the piece (and this has been a consistent problem in all of Kevin Smith's movies), is that it was too scripted.  Much of the dialog between the characters was nothing more than actors exchanging rehearsed speeches.  There is nobody to blame here but Kevin, who both wrote and directed this waste of celluloid.At the end, I was begging for the credits.  Every minute brought more and bitter disappointment that pinnacled at Alanis Morissette's appearance.Please don't waste your time watching this.  Kevin, PLEASE do better next time.

Basically Cardinal Ignatius Glick (George Carlin) announces many changes being made to improve Catholicism's fading image, including a Buddy Jesus, and the re-dedication ceremony day when all who enter the church will have their sins forgiven, and be morally clean. This attracts the attention of angels stuck on Earth, Bartleby (Ben Affleck) who talked Loki (Matt Damon) into quitting his position as angel of death. They are both banned from Heaven to serve eternity in the place worse than Hell, Wisconsin, and as they travel to the church, Loki wants to get back into God's good book by killing all people he could consider sinners. Abortion clinic worker Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) with a special heritage is visited by voice of God angel Metatron (Alan Rickman) who tells her that if the two angels get to the church, they will inadvertently cause all existence to end. So with the help of prophets Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself, only uttering a few words somewhere in the middle), and soon joined by the 13th Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock), they are determined to get to the church and stop the angels from entering Heaven. Also starring Jason Lee as Azrael, Razzie nominated Salma Hayek as Serendipity, Ratatouille's Janeane Garofalo as Liz, Alanis Morissette as God and Ethan Suplee as Noman the Golgothan. Unsurprisingly this offended many Catholic groups when it was released, and while the film is a little patchy, it is the moments of gross humour and the unique script that make this film work.

I have loved some of John Waters' early films and they are VERY offensive, but they also had some cleverness or depth to them. But a film like DOGMA that is deliberately offensive AND full of such shallow and lousy performances as well as writing--that is unforgivable! It was as if, again and again, in order to shock the viewer, they went for cheap laughs and obscenities. My attitude is if you are an atheist or agnostic or whatever, at least have the strength of convictions to try to say what you think or be willing to mock conventional religion INTELLIGENTLY. Having Jay and Silent Bob (the poster kids for idiocy) walk about cursing or having the Virgin Mary II working for an abortion clinic just don't seem funny--just shocking and cruel.See it if you want--I don't particularly care. However, don't (like many have tried) try to convince me that this is witty or funny. What's funny about this film? There were very few genuine laughs in the entire thing.

It was suspenseful and kept me wondering how the movie was going to end.  It definitely asks some interesting questions about religion and catholicism.  I saw some great performances by Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, and Alan Rickman.  I think Ben Affleck has Oscar potential for this role.  I really do.  A must see, even if you live in Wisconsin like me.  Take pride that Wisconsin is used. Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Laborious and heavy-handed as both writer and director, Smith introduces far too many characters for the film's own good, squandering any opportunity for coherence and clarity.  Linda Fiorentino, ostensibly the central protagonist of the muddy narrative, comes off as bored and uninvolved in the action -- perhaps the greatest single blow to the picture.  Also a disappointment is the usually tremendous Chris Rock, who seems lost amid the inflated number of cast members vying for screen time.  Surprisingly, his disgruntled apostle Rufus takes a backseat to Jason Mewes' foul-mouthed Jay in the laugh-line department.  Dogma's middle section fairly screams out to be trimmed to a reasonable length, but even that would not be enough to sort out the disorder and inconsistency that mark the film as one of Smith's lesser outings.

This is a two hour justification of christianity. And if you don't know this stuff, it's not funny. If you do, it's still not very good. At least, Linda Fiorentino, Salma Hayek and Alanis Morissette looked pretty.

These actors, like George Carlin, love to bash religion and other things that people deem important.  However, if you bash things that they find important then it is a hate crime.  I am tired of the double standards in this country and this movie is a perfect example of that.  Movies like this are not funny. They further degrade the thin moral line.  I am not trying to say that the church cannot be made fun of, but it should be done in a tasteful way and in a way that will not make religion or God (any god, whatever you believe)look bad. People who are more liberal than me are always saying how people are violating their rights.  Well, this movie violated on mine.A message to George Carlin  Your church bashing is getting old.A message to Kevin Smith  Make a real movie.

Some kind of Cruel Intentions like thrash that wanted to be intellectual. What angered me most about this movie that the characters always said that bigotry and homophobia would be bad, but the movie itself was very homophobic! This two Jay and Silent Bob idiots are so stupid you want to hit them! I mean if Jay would have got a boyfriend in the end, then the message would be that he learned his lesson. The only good scene in this movie in God's answer to the meaning of life. But otherwise, don't waste your time with this badly directed and acted piece of junk.

Do not get this movie. Don't accept it as a free rental. Don't watch it at a friend's house. Every goofy bit of god-talk and obnoxious sybolism that could be stuffed into a worthless plot design made it into this one. Complete with a fat-assed angel in a tutu to save the day, even the blood stains and dry cleaning were handled by this phony, miserable accomodation to religious myth and bible thumping fairy tales.  Not a single good moment here. So bad it will melt the plastic Jesus on your dashboard.

He is a very good film maker, as well as Matt Damon, Alan Rickman, LInda Fiorentino great actors. But if the film is bad, if this is an unpardonable blasphemy, then no one and nothing can save this from a most miserable flop as this is. I am not a Catholic, rather, I am a Protestant, and I agreed with several jabs at the Papal religion in the film, especially the ones about the indulgences, God's consent with the church and some more. What I disagreed with and found the most repulsive was the childish humor aimed at Jesus, God Himself and the apostles. The Bible is not a relative book which every person may interpret the way he likes. The Bible is the Word Of God, and that is that. Smith is a kind of a Buddhist with his relativism. This is not great. And he chose the wrong topic to mock at. God is not a senile geezer, He is the Lord. This film is Not recommended. "}]
