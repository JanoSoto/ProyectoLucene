[{"Title":"A true B movie...","Date":"5 July 2002","Score":"21 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Many of the comments here seem to want to review this movie as if it was a real major motion picture.  In reality, this was very much a B movie and should be judged in the same class as movies with giant bunny rabbits and bug-eyed aliens.  Not only is the story implausible, but they are adding this film to the definition of the word.  Like many B movies, this film has a few well-known actors who dropped in for the weekend to read it off of cue cards, were paid in cash, and somehow forget to list this film on their resume.  Kevin Pollak and Timothy Hutton definitely had alimony payments coming due that weekend.  Like all great B movies, the budget was miniscule.  The movie takes place entirely in a diner, not because it was a good idea, but because they couldn't even afford decent stock footage.  Beyond the few actors with names, the remaining cast was selected by who was in the commissary that day.  What's really fun is how the set is obviously raided from scenery storerooms.  What's with that British phone booth?  And, B movies love to toss around the nukes, with no real thought to strategy, consequences, fallout, war powers act, or anything else at all.  Last, but not least, we have the surprise ending, which even those who knew the surprise didn't seem to see coming. There are clearly some fun things about this film.  The Iraqi chemical and biological threat that gets sorta forgotten later in the film.  The use of two different ocean nuclear detonations to make one supposed city detonation.  The news network with more intelligence gathering capabilities than the US government (including their own spy satellite network), and yet having only one anchor and really crummy graphics.  The pictures of F-117 fighters referred to as B2 bombers.  The compressed time (just how fast were those missiles and bombers flying?), combined with pacing by snail.  The don't mind us attitude about random citizens sitting in on a war strategy meeting, occasionally butting in.  Let's put the ultra top secret combination for the football on speakerphone so everyone can hear! But, everyone has watched a lot of B movies and found them entertaining (or at least not too boring).  I found this film entertaining and made it all of the way through it.  It's worth a viewing just for fun (especially if you are not paying for it).  After all, you know you saw Night of the Lepus!

Finding his hands tied, the President issues a warning to the Iraqi leader leave Kuwait and power down your weapons of mass destruction, within two hours,  or else you and your city will be hit with a nuclear bomb.After this threat, the film does into high pressure tension mode.  Will the President keep his promise?  Is he bluffing?  And what is going to happen if he does use a nuclear bomb against his enemies?Trust me, this is a film that will NOT disappoint.

Like The War at Home, a post-Vietnam war drama starring Emilio Estevez, Deterrence received a very minor release, but will end up being one of the year's best films.  Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects, Grumpy Old Men) stars as the President of the United States.  Pollak, however, was not elected, but was appointed Vice President and then took over after the death of the President.  Forced to stay in a Colorado diner because of a blizzard, Pollak and his 2 most trusted assistants, played by Timothy Hutton (Ordinary People, Playing God) and Sheryl Lee Ralph (Bogus, White Man's Burden) find out about an illegal invasion into Kuwait by Sadaam Hussein's son. After some thought Pollak goes on National Television and announces a deadline for Hussein to leave or Pollak will drop a nuclear bomb on Baghdad.  The whole film takes place inside this diner and relies on the tension that builds up as they get closer and closer to the deadline and as Pollak has to weigh his decision hearing arguments from both sides.  The film is fascinating thanks to a strong amount of tension built up as we truly wonder what is going to happen.  Hutton and Ralph are both solid as the 2 assistants, but the film belongs to Pollak and his strong lead performance.  Highly recommended.

It plays well, as a good made for cable movie, but not as a big screen feature.  The entire film is set in one interior location with the only visual images of the outside world coming from television broadcasts that the characters watch in the diner.  A film can be done well shot in one location, as Hitchcock proved, but writer/director Rod Lurie isn't quite up to the challenge and the film sometimes feels sluggish.  The film opens with a montage of clips of speeches by former presidents, and one future fictitious one, decrying war, intercut with a view of Earth from space, as the opening credits come up.  For some pretentious reason the first five minutes of the film, setting up the support characters in the diner, is shot in black and white and only switches to color with the entrance of the president (Pollak) and his entourage.   The locals who inhabit this Diner are one-dimensional stereotypes.   There is the weathered and wise old black cook, the ignorant racist trucker, and the dizzy French Canadian waitress.  We only know that she's French Canadian because one of the patrons identifies her accent, though her accent shifts back and forth from Southern drawl to a Midwest (Fargo) accent.  The film would have been a lot better had these characters been erased from the screenplay all together.  Perhaps it had to be set in a diner because the budget couldn't cover a war room or White House set.   The crisis story is believable and much of the dialogue between the president and his advisors is well written.  Timothy Hutton, as the president's old friend and advisor, has a nice short monologue about the Los Alamos tests and the destruction of Baghdad that does more to evoke the scale of the situation than anything else in the film does.  To be fair to the film, I watched it a twice before jotting this down.  There was a twist at the end of the film that I thought was out of place the first time I saw it that made sense upon my second viewing.  The president has an ace up his sleeve and I thought it was preposterous that he would hold back information from his staff just so the film could surprise the audience at the end.  But on second viewing I saw where he advises his staff off screen away from the other characters.  Stock footage is used often, and usually pretty well, during the news reports that come into the diner.  Though sometimes they should have avoided using stock footage all together. (An F117 is not a B2 bomber and the detonation footage from the Bikini Atoll has been used a thousand times already and detracts from the emotional impact of the moment) It's a fairly clever script that would do well, minus some of the support characters, as a one-act play.  It's definitely worth renting when it comes out on video.  As for seeing it in the theaters&#133;it's good to see studios like Paramount putting out small original films like this&#133;but I wish it could have been done better for the big screen.

In DETTERENCE this would probably mean that the Iraqis would be able to mobilize their entire armed forces without the Americans noticing , allowing the president to trapped in a diner during a snowstorm . I'd be the first to admit that this takes some swallowing but if you watch a film too closely then very few films you see will ever work so let's ignore the unlikeliness of it Unfortunately what happens next is that the audience become more and more aware of factual errors and implausibilities throughout the running time . We're told that Iraq  has sent three divisions ...half a million men into Kuwait  I'm fairly certain that in military circles a division is composed of 8,000 to 10,000 troops not 133,000 as stated here . The President decides to nuke Iraq but since Iraq also has nuclear weapons there's a danger of a nuclear counterstrike . This is the main stumbling block with DETERRENCE because it's impossible to believe the Iraqi regime would ever be allowed to posses such an arsenal . And if that leaves you scratching your head wait till it's revealed at the end that America and France were responsible for supplying the Iraqis with the bomb  so that Iraq wouldn't be able to manufacture its own nuclear deterrent  ! Let me think , America and France will supply Iraq with nuclear warheads and a delivery system so that the Iraqis won't manufacture their own weapons of mass destruction . When you've got something as ridiculously illogical as that in your screenplay then it's easy to miss other factual errors like a B-2 bomber being confused with a F-111 , Baghdad having a population of 12 million people or stock footage of Baghdad being in the center of the Pacific ocean as it's destroyed by a 100 megaton bomb I'm sure writer/director Rod Lurie originally conceived this story for the stage . It's impossible to watch this thinking it's a cinematic movie and alas Lurie has written his characters as stereotypes such as the hick redneck , the angry blackman etc . It's not helped either that the cast give far from compelling performances . Hutton may be excused for slapping his head too often because that's how I reacted to the unconvincing dialogue while Kevin Pollack doesn't come across as being very presidential but that is the point - his character isn't supposed to be presidential at all . But there's far better , more realistic movies similar to this like FAIL SAFE which was made during the cold war where the premise was so compelling because it was frighteningly realistic .

The basic premise of having a non-elected president in the midst of a primary campaign being faced with making a decision of world-wide consequence had promise.  But then as the story unfolded and had this mandate-less president making quick rash decisions to kill millions of people and risk global nuclear war, the plot quickly lost any pretense of reality.The ending made the earlier decisions in the movie all the more ridiculous. This president apparently knew, well before deciding to kill millions of people within a couple of hours of the situation breaking, that the USA was never seriously threatened by the Iraqi actions.  Thus he killed all of those people without good reason, and does so with a pretty cavalier attitude.So we are left with the main character being reduced to a psychopathic idiot.

Pollak, Hutton, and Ralph all have moments where they really shine, despite the idiotic script and ham-handed amateur direction.  (Not everyone is great, though; Sean Astin...Jesus, what the hell ever happened to him?)But in the end the movie just cannot overcome the intrinsic flaws of the script.  First of all, Lurie has biographer's syndrome.  He sat there and wrote his script and came up with all of these fascinating little biographies for each and every one of his characters and he wants to tell us all about every single one of them.  So there are huge chunks of dialogue that say nothing more than I did this, Remember when that happened, So-and-so did something else, blah blah blah, hugely awkward tracts of expository dialogue fleshing out Lurie's fictional political world but stopping the story cold.  (His newest movie, THE CONTENDER, is just as guilty of this sin.)  And then the twist ending was just so ludicrous, and, by the way, utterly implausible due to Lurie's lack of research.

FRANCE?  I'm sorry, weren't they fighting alongside America and Britain and everyone else during the Gulf War?  What the hell is France doing giving nukes...not just nukes, mind you, but full-fledged _intercontinental ballistic missiles_ complete with propulsion and guidance systems...to a terrorist nation?

I truly enjoyed seeing the frugality with which this film was made. So many have mentioned the freak snow storm as being central to the story; it's there to explain why there is only one set of people, it doesn't contribute to the story materially at all.

First of all, the entire movie takes place in a diner in some town in the middle of nowhere. As a film student, I realize how expensive it is to move to different locations (or even just be ON location), to travel with an entire movie crew, and even that just to move a camera to a different angle could take all day and be very costly. But you need to keep in mind that in order to make a convincing political thriller, at least SOME of this needs to be done. I mean, there wasn't even a single SHOT that was not taken in this diner (at least none that weren't borrowed from previous news footage).Besides that, the acting wasn't great. Timmothy Hutton was the only actor in the film of any consequence, and he delivered the only really good performance of anyone in the entire film. Kevin Pollack put forth a good effort as the inexperienced and overloaded new President, but he was terribly miscast. No matter how many people came before him in the order of assuming the Presidency, no one as short and bald as him would have generated much respect from the American people. I know that this is a prejudicial thing to say, but it's true. The American public does not respect a President AS MUCH if he (or she, someday) is not tall, good looking, full head of hair, etc. Appearance is extremely important, and Kevin Pollack doesn't have much of it. (spoilers) That little element bothered me, but I am more than willing to overlook it in the interest of enjoying the film. However, there are certain things that I absolutely will not overlook. The cook's suicide, for example. You have the stereotypical, uneducated black man working the grill in some hole-in-the-wall diner, yet he seems to be very intelligent. After attempting to voice his opinion to the President about dropping the bomb, he is rudely interrupted and entirely ignored. When it seems that the bomb will inevitably be dropped, he KILLS himself. What the hell is that all about?! Is that a subliminal message being sent out to the public? You can't change what the government does, so if you don't like it, suicide is surely the only answer. This suicide was completely unnecessary to the story and was thrown in for no other reason than to have a couple of deaths in the film, as well as to kill the only guy who knew the codes to drop the bomb. The makers of Deterrence clearly did not blow much of their budget on writers.Even though every part of the film that did not take place in the diner was conducted over the phone, Deterrence clearly tries extremely hard to stimulate the emotions of the audience, but the simplicity of the story and the quickly thrown together script reduce the film to bottom-shelf drivel that will very soon be forgotten. President Emerson not only made the offensive decision entirely too early (it was clear that he would drop the bomb within the first half hour of the film), he also ignored the advice of his personal staff for the vast majority of the film. This is boring, boring stuff. I was not even moved the tiniest bit when the bomb was dropped and Baghdad (the civilization where civilization began) was completely destroyed, along with everyone in it. Way too simple, not at all convincing, and routinely directed, Deterrence plays like a book being read to the audience. Everything is implied, suggested, vicariously explained, and entirely without effect.

The ending of this movie like Fail Safe is very hard to digest as a real option but like Fail Safe it causes us to think about the seriousness of war in our times.  In both cases the role of instant communication is a contributor to the resolution that saves the world but at a price.  The cast is adequate. The President is calm and very profession in his detachment from the emotions of the situation.  Another shared value with Fail Safe.  The sum of this movie is a contempory reminder of the danger of believing that we have progressed with technology as our protector when in fact the critical decisions are still human and the consequences are of those decisions are human.  I recommend this movie to all serious thinking views.

This film has absolutely no feel or understanding of even the most basic features of its subject matter. It tries to fake credibility while throwing around ridiculous non-facts such as a 100 megaton bomb, a B2 stealth bomber being casually tracked by Iraqi radar, a TV communications satellite that somehow is equipped with not only a real time TV camera but one that films ground level shots. When the movie shows a clip of the B2, we instead see an F-117 which looks absolutely nothing like a B2. The super duper satellite (actually just one of a small constellation of satellites the TV network supposedly owns) seems to be able to warp back 50 years at will because it captures familiar black and white footage that is obviously from one of the early H-bomb test in the Pacific Ocean. This is more remarkable still as the explosion is supposed to be taking place in the middle of a desert.The President and his advisors are playing out their full intercontinental nuclear game of brinksmanship in a little over an hour, and yet still have time to chat up the morons repeatedly at length in the diner. For some inexplicable reason the morons, including one gun toting one, have not been sent packing by the Secret Service but instead are allowed to butt into and sidetrack negotiations between heads of state in which tens of millions of lives are at stake. The only moron who is even mildly rebuked is a ludicrous right wing homophobic bigoted anti-Semite cardboard character of the sort only a Hollywood provincial pinhead could believe exists out there in fly-over land.All these features seem to be in the film to give it heft and credibility so that it can go about preaching some kind of demented apocalyptic message to us. In the course of their proselytizing, the films writers have their President off handily incinerate a large city of mostly innocents in order to demonstrate what a peace loving mensch he is.Alfred Hitchcock thought that actors were some of God's dumbest creatures.

This is good, because on first glance, Yoda might have been a better choice for President.Throughout this movie, Pollak plays a man clearly not up to the task of being Mr President, and his interactions with Hutton convey beautifully this impression.As the film unfolds and tension becomes palpable among the few characters we see, the promise of a great movie comes closer and closer into view.The story intricately interweaves fact and fiction to build credibility in both Pollak and the events he is desparately trying to control, and as he talks to various world-leaders and Ambassadors, he conveys the desparation of the moment perfectly.Unfortunately, this ends about 5 minutes from the end when the movie crosses the line between believable/possible to stupid/ridiculous.I was almost offended at the ending, about which the kindest thing I can say is anti-climactic.Pollak seems to genuinely agonize about his decision on the one hand, and not understand what he is doing on the other; if this is what the director wished to convery, then it was done very well.Sadly, the ending appears to be from a different movie altogether. Pollak turns from almost-statesman almost-clueless inside of about 3 minutes, and the 100 Mgaton bomb that we see supposedly being dropped on Baghdad looks suspiciously close to the ocean.The one other thing the researchers could have done before this movie would have been to watch History Channel or something to find out how big of a hole in the Middle East a bomb of that size would make.Yes, indeedie ...... and this is the REALLY sad bit Pollak - who had been agonizing over the impending horrible deaths of twelve million people trying to escape Baghdad becomes so cavalier, it again seems like we are watching a different movie.All in all, I sincerely wish I had died before the last 10 minutes of this train-wreck, then I would have gone to Heaven thinking I had just seen a great suspense-drama.Instead, I am annoyed that I didn't do laundry or yardwork instead "},{"Title":"One-room that begins in Black and White","Date":"2 September 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  In case you do not want to wade through all the other comments, there are two important things to know.First, the beginning is in Black and White then suddenly goes to color, as if it was made fifty years ago when color was first invented.Second, virtually all of the movie occurs in a diner and consists of dialog and news reporters on television.I consider it to be quite boring.

The former Soviet Union developed and tested a 57-megaton weapon in 1961. The weapon was so outsized that its carrier plane needed modification to its bomb bay doors just to get the thing off the ground.

How dumb the fact that the most powerful man in the free world is stuck in a diner is appalling...  You'd think that a man in this position would be aware of weather conditions days before being trapped in such conditions.

The zoom-ins in times of tension are so forced they in fact do the exact opposite of their intended purpose, make the audience feel it's watching a picture, and not the other way around.The truly unpleasant elements of the picture are it's all too obvious, and profoundly dangerous depictions of the White House's alleged peaceful and humane means, they are lies which are more frightening than anything else.  It gives the young, inexperienced American viewers the impression their government is a safe and peace-loving creation, which unfortunately is all too false.Granted, this film does have some elements worthy of mention in a positive aspect, mainly and solely Kevin Pollack's integrity in the holding of the character he portrays.  Unfortunately, he isn't strong enough to sustain such a bad supporting cast, one which eerily brings to mind that of Beverly Hills 90210 or Melrose's Place.

Just one example of both the phoniness and corniness at the end of the film, the president of the U.S. has just ordered the nuclear bombing of Baghdad, killing millions of people.

Therefore, no matter what interesting dramatic conflicts arise for President Emerson during the story, I can't help but wish someone was playing him.Also, there's a few patrons/employees of the diner that are very one note - you'll notice this was you watch.Ted's Grade C+/B- "},{"Title":"Bizarre garbage","Date":"24 November 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" A very strange, ill-directed mess.

Quite simply, we must be able to believe what we are seeing on the screen before we can fully give ourselves over to the film.  This is where `Deterrence' runs into trouble.  Too often, we find ourselves questioning the logic and motivations of many of the main characters' actions and, as a result, we become curious bystanders to the unfolding events rather than deeply involved participants.  In short, `Deterrence' seems, in many ways, more like an `exercise' than a full-fledged, deeply engrossing film.The style of the work adds to that impression.  A first film by former LA movie critic Rod Lurie, `Deterrence' is a single-set, multi-character chamber piece that attempts to recapture the tension and immediacy of such Cold War classics as `On the Beach' and, most significantly, `Fail Safe.'  In this film, Kevin Pollak plays President Walter Emerson, a Gerald Ford-type figure who has never actually been elected to the office but rather ascended to it on the sudden death of the previous president.  On the day of the Colorado primary (in which Emerson hopes a victory might begin to secure his own sense of legitimacy in the eyes of his constituents), he and several of his staff members find themselves amazingly lost and stranded in a snowbound diner.  Suddenly, a major international crisis flares up - a renewed invasion of Kuwait by the Iraqis, led this time by the nephew of Saddam Hussein.  This is where the credibility of the story begins to show signs of strain.  Because so many of the American troops are already stationed near North Korea, President Emerson, with breathtaking assurance and speed, unilaterally decides to threaten to drop a nuclear bomb on Baghdad if Hussein doesn't agree to peacefully withdraw his forces.  In `Fail Safe,' the President was forced to respond to nuclear retaliation resulting from an accidental launching of missiles on the Soviet Union.  That was believable.  Here, the President is CREATING the nuclear situation with his unjustifiably rash response.  In short, we simply don't believe that any rational United States President would react in such a preposterous and foolish way.  True, the surprise ending of the film does go a long way towards explaining Emerson's actions, but it comes too late to make up for all the head-scratching the audience goes through during most of the rest of the film.  (And the explanation isn't really believable anyway &#150; it seems like a gimmick tacked on to give the story a clever spin at the end).Simply from a cinematic standpoint, it is rare to see a film set entirely in a single room that is NOT based on a stage play.  Yet, `Deterrence' is an original work made directly for the big screen.  Therefore, one admires writer/director Lurie's willingness to circumscribe his drama within so limited a setting, with the intention, undoubtedly, of allowing us to focus undistracted on the human drama at the story's core (although one assumes that budgetary constraints may have played a part in the choice as well).  But one-set dramas require an extraordinarily skilled hand to pull them off successfully, and, at this point at least, Lurie lacks the ability to really deliver an emotionally powerful, tightly wound work.  Most of the characters emerge as shallow and uninteresting.  President Emerson is presented to us as a weak, insecure figure who may be using this display of international bravado to counteract the `wimp factor' image he seems to convey to the American public and the world at large.  Yet, we never really seem to get very deep into his psyche and persona.  Ditto for his staff members and the `cross section of humanity' that populate the diner &#150; a group of dull, witless common man figures that have little to do but act out their trite little dramas one by one, only to fade into the background for the remainder of the film's duration.  It's amazing how little suspense the potential end of the world generates in this film.  We get no real sense of panic or internal struggle on the part of the various characters - of tightly wound emotional coils suddenly being sprung.  Compare this film to, say, `Twelve Angry Men,' a truly engrossing drama set all in one room.  But in that work, each character became a recognizable individual and, as a result, we could truly FEEL the tension that arose from the emotional conflicts that played out among them.  Even the acting in `Deterrence' seems weak and undercharged.  None of the characters appears to be genuinely upset by what is taking place around him.  It all comes across like the most amateurish of playacting, even though the cast includes some notable actors, foremost among them Timothy Hutton as one of Emerson's trusted advisors.`Deterrence' is a well-meaning and adequate first try, I guess.  But somehow, if you can't even make a film dealing with the end of the world seem suspenseful and compelling, it may be best to tackle some less explosive subject the next time around.  And let's face it, it may not be all the filmmaker's fault; perhaps in the twenty-first century, potential nuclear self-annihilation just isn't as relevant or `hot' a topic &#150; in both movies and in real life - as it was in the long ago days of the Cold War.  I guess that's a good thing.  Whatever the reason for its failure, however, `Deterrence' does the unthinkable;  it turns the threat of nuclear war into a yawn-inducing bore.

Emerson is an un-elected president, elevated to the presidency when his predecessor died in office and he is having a difficult run in the primaries.  His party is caught in a blizzard and is forced to take shelter in a roadside diner.  Shortly after his arrival, he learns from a television news report that Iraq has invaded Kuwait and the army is on its way to Saudi Arabia in a repeat of the 1991 Gulf War Crisis.Emerson turns the diner into a mobile situation room and assesses the strategic implications.  He is informed that the confidence is high that Iraq has mobile chemical and biological weapons that can be deployed in the next 90 minutes.  To further complicate matters, U.S. forces have been drawn so far down and are so scattered that they can't mount any meaningful response for weeks.  President Emerson makes an executive decision and after obtaining a live feed, goes on television to announce that if the Republican Guard does not retreat, he will order a nuclear strike on Baghdad in one hour and 20 minutes.Iraq refuses to negotiate with Emerson because he is Jewish.  They then announce that they have more than 20 long-range nuclear weapons that they will launch on cities worldwide like New York, Paris and Tokyo if the B2 bomber enters their airspace.  They also have one targeted at NORAD, which is 40 miles from the president's current location.  This is the setup in this taut international thriller where two intractable leaders stare over the abyss waiting for the other to blink.   This is an excellent story that makes nuclear confrontation seem all too plausible in the post cold war era.  Though there are many flaws, the basic concept is sound and frightening, and the nail biting suspense is absorbing and extremely well done.  The likelihood of this scenario can be debated, but there are certain areas where the film comes up short.The film was produced on a shoestring (less than $1M) and it showed.  It had the feel of a TV movie.  The camera work was mediocre at best with numerous shots poorly framed. The camera operator often had trouble following the movement of actors.  The news reports were also unrealistic. One plot element was inconceivable.  The entire idea that the five citizens in the diner would be allowed to stay and witness the president's decision making process during a national security crisis is ludicrous.  That would be like inviting people from the White House tour into the Oval Office during such an event.  Some arrangement would be made to sequester these people.  They would have been locked in the kitchen or told to sit in their cars until the crisis abated.The acting of the major players was very good.  Kevin Pollack gave one of his best performances to date as the president without a mandate.  He was strong, tough and resolute and took complete command of the situation.  Timothy Hutton was also excellent as the chief of staff, always buzzing around the president giving him new angles to consider and often overstepping his authority.  Sheryl Lee Ralph gave a strong performance as the president's national security advisor and was strident and insistent about her opinion, which was in direct opposition to the president's decision.Despite its shortcomings, this film presented a tense and engrossing story that was within the realm of possibility, making it that much more interesting and terrifying.  I rated it an 8/10.  It definitely rises above its humble budget and is worth hunting down in the rental stacks.

Having taken the office after his vice-presidency put him in the role after the death of the previous president, Walter Emerson is on the campaign trail in a snowy Colorado on the day of the presidential primary.  He and his team take sheltered from a blizzard when news reaches them that Uday Hussein has invaded Kuwait.  Using a camera crew and satellite phones, the President sends an ultimatum to Uday to withdraw or see Baghdad hit with a nuclear weapon.  As the deadline approaches, Iraq reveals their nuclear weapons and the world responds by fuelling theirs.  With tensions in the diner high, Emerson tries to control the start of WWIII.The film opens with stylish references of US Presidents to peace & war, before moving to our future (but not futuristic) setting.  Events have passed this film by but not in such a way that the themes and situations it describes are unlikely &#150; just the detail.  The death of Uday Hussein and the recent (2003) activity in Iraq make this topical as well as out of date but the plot still works.The setting of a diner makes it feel like a stage piece and it works well as that &#150; we don't really need to see the threat or see the political wheels turning &#150; the tension is nicely held in the diner.  Also it highlights the fact that even if Emerson had been in the thick of the White House, he would still have been just one man with the world at his feet.  The way that he immediately makes a nuclear threat is a bit of a problem and starts the action out on an unlikely footing &#150; one that comes back to haunt it in the end, but more of that later.For the majority of the film the tension works well and the escalation of the threat is palatable.  The battle of wills with everything at stake works well mostly because it is not that unlikely &#150; the role of America, the diplomatic relations and the focus on the middle east means that it never becomes very detached from reality.  However the payoff of the film (and the reason for Emerson's strong line) is a letdown and a let-off for the writer.  It takes the carefully inflated balloon of tension and simply pops it with a bang that is not part of reality and is way out of left field &#150; it is simply too tidy.  The fact that he would play the risk that Iraq could not have any other weapons other than the US built ones, or that no other countries (Japan is hit) would not respond with their own, is too great to accept.  The message, that a strong face is needed to hold back rouge states etc, falls flat simply because the writer removes the threat of retaliation.  With it he has an issue that he neatly side steps.  As director though, ex-Empire scribe Lurie does a good job and he works his confined space to good effect.As a stage play of sorts a lot relies on the cast and they do pretty well.  They do tend to get left behind by the wider global drama but Pollack stands up well with Hutton and Ralph giving good support.  The diner characters don't do so well as they don't have much to do and are broad reactionary stereotypes that the film uses to make a point or to move the plot forward.  None of them really does that well but the script doesn't use them that well anyway.The basic setup and delivery is pretty good despite a few issues, however, the end of the film is the cause of those little problems and reveals itself to be too tidy and convenient and is not a satisfying conclusion to such a film as it doesn't connect with reality (despite being clever).  Overall an enjoyable film but pulls the rug out from under you at the end.

A debilitating snowstorm lands him in a little isolated country greasy spoon diner, where several otherlocals and customers are stranded.

And as a side note, the opening of the movie in black and white was a very nice touch, graphically. As far as the drawbacks, Sean Astin is usually very good, but his character was atrocious. This is a must watch for anyone to see how the world can change in the matter of hours. This has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Watch this movie!

This was a very smart screenplay. It could well have been a hint of things to come in the middle east had the events of Sept.11, 2001 not sped up our concentrated involvement in that area. It still, however, shows some dilemmas caused by that areas prejudices between groups. In the film Iraq re-invades Kuwait as a novice unelected president tries to handle the situation from a remote location in the Colorado Mountains during a blizzard. Iraq points some chemical weapons at their neighbors- or are they nukes bought from the French who got them from us?? Now the talk gets tough except our president is Jewish and the Iraqis won't parlay with a Jew- while some on his staff insists he not say anything on an unsecured phone line.Of course I'm no film student so my view of the real world is tainted with realism such as intelligent people working in mundane jobs or that people with IQs of 105 can be enlightened about some limited fields such as societal woes or the horror of nuclear fallout. I admit there is a kind of who done it ending that wraps everything up in a brief monologue by Kevin Pollack with which I was not entirely comfortable. However, it does put a slant on ones thinking in so far as our on again off again real life political relationship with the French is concerned. I loved this movie!! I enjoyed this drama as much as the unfolding tension surrounding The Contender(another Rob Lurie film) and though I am hardly a Rob Lurie fan (I thought The Castle sucked beyond dry) I have kept his name in my memory since my first viewing of Deterrence waiting for any other gem he may write...or direct. To me- it was that good!!  "},{"Title":"Is this a way to end such a great movie?

This is an excellent film. I highly recommend it to any fan of tense, intelligent drama.One, it confirms to the intelligent viewer the same message as does other great films like Clerks, Conspiracy, or Six Degrees of Separation (to name a view in this vein) great film is about drama and that is it. Good drama is not about special effects, choreographed fight scenes, A-list Hollywood celebrities, or even tear-wrenching Oscar-nominated performances.Good film is about the inter-play between different people, with different motivations, from different walks of life, thrust into a conflict situation. It gives us insight into how factors like knowledge, responsibility, and conflict, changes people.Here is a warning. This is a low budget film. It is shot in a single location, a diner where the president of the United States and his entourage have had to seek refuge from a sudden winter storm in Colorado. From here he has to resolve a major world crisis, in plain view of other civilians who are also stuck in this diner.I agree with other posters' comments that the interaction between the president and these other diners throughout the crisis is fairly implausible, but it does make for very interesting dialogue. However, it is this interaction which makes the film interesting. The same gobal conflict resolved from the White House would only be half as interesting from a humanistic and dramatic point of view.This film drives home one point very well. People in great positions of power are human beings like everyone else, only they are privilege to certain information, and are burdened with responsibility. Every person on earth has (or should have) an opinion on whether or not a nuclear weapon should ever actually be dropped, but ultimately this inhumanly difficult decisions falls on the shoulders one person, a person who has his own life, his own private successes and failures, and who's background may have in no way prepared him to make this decision. (Kevin Pollack's excellently played president was not elected into office, but succeeded into office as vice president.) So for those of you who complained about this film's low budget and technical inaccuracies, please go back to your Mission Impossible 2s, your Charlie's Angels, and your Jean Claude Van Damme. You won't be missed. You are the bigoted truck driver played by Sean Astin who gets so elegantly dismissed by the president (funniest moment in the movie). "}]
