[{"Title":"Island of Cut-Throats","Date":"6 December 2004","Score":"52 out of 77 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Making a valiant stab at becoming an action figure, Geena Davis plays Morgan Adams, a wily, rough & tumble pirate woman who lives for adventure and the like. When her evil Uncle Dawg (Frank Langella) turns on her and her dad, it's a race against time for Morgan as she tries to piece together a map that will lead her to Cut-Throat Island, where unimaginable wealth in stolen pirate gold resides. Along the way she is pursued by an evil British officer who goes into cahoots with treacherous crew members and Dawg, aided by a pretty boy Jack-of-all-trades thief named William Shaw (Matthew Modine), and confronted with a series of wildly over the top set pieces that no human being could possibly survive. One of the most expensive flops ever made, this overlong but endearing and even occasionally exciting film deserved much better than what it got in the summer of the mid-90s. Not quite as funny as Pirates of the Caribbean but still fun. Already a cardboard cut-out role to begin with, Geena Davis struggles to overcome her natural aura of motherly warmth to play the roughish Morgan, but she plays the part well enough (she really does come across as somebody's mother, albeit the kind of mother neighborhood boys fantasize about). It's easy to imagine her in the ring with Keira Knightley - who played Elizabeth Swann in Pirates of the Caribbean - and to have Geena walloping Keira's waif like frame. Matthew Modine has his moments as Shaw and Frank Dracula/Skeletor Langella is enjoyably hammy as Dawg.If nothing else, rent it for the expensive sets, fancy costumes, and elaborate, over the top stunts - many of which Davis and Modine did themselves.

The locations used in the film are first class as are the costumes. The fact that many of the stunts in the film were performed by the actors and not stunt doubles seems to add an immediacy and credibility to the film. There is what I would call non-nasty violence in the film (think of the A-Team) and occasional language which although again not really nasty, could deter parents from allowing the younger members of the family from sitting down and watching this as a kind of family matin√©e film.

Sweeping and powerful, it serves the plotline well and it's a joy to listen to on its own. Although the characters aren't among the most complex and well defined in movie history, they work (with a couple of exceptions, among them Maury Chaykin as John Reed, whose acting just doesn't match the tone of the film). And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships, well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects.In short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time.

Being a woman certainly doesn't stop Morgan Adams (Geena Davis) from plundering and manning the high seas. Sure, she's a bit incredible at first, but this movie is more about the classic treasure-hunt adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson than any life realities. Just look at the success of Pirates of the Caribbean! At least this movie is far more realistic than that, without any curses and such and...sadly, without the prizewinning role played by Depp. Davis does manage to lend credence to the part of a strong woman who still maintains some rules and beliefs in her pirating. She is the daughter of a pirate captain. Her father is murdered by her uncle, Dawg (Frank Langella), in his search for a mysterious treasure. Apparently, several of the family members each carried a piece of the map to this treasure but none of them wanted to share it and thus, it has remained unfound. Morgan begins a journey to get that which is rightfully her's and her shipmates, all while being pursued by the British navy, her uncle, and amorously pursued by a professional thief, William Shaw (Matthew Modine).

"},{"Title":"Surprised, ofttimes entertained, but ultimately disappointed.","Date":"1 October 2010","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The biggest box office flop of all-time. Its curiosity from that fact that drove me to finally watch this movie 15-years after its original release and is probably why most of you are here reading this review. Curious to how a movie involving pirates with a ~100$M budget and a seemingly attractive name like Cutthroat Island could fail so spectacularly. Below are my impressions- Geena Davis (main actress) B-list quality. Relatively physically unattractive, ofttimes robotic in delivery of lines (sometimes the result of poor dialogue by the writers), emotionally detached (seems to lack facial expressions except when smiling), and amateurish acting in a lot of the earlier scenes (being out-acted by a monkey is not a good way to start off a movie). She also had the weight of stigmas regarding the believability of a female captain commanding ship and crew to contend with (see Keira Knightley's later performance in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean; awkwardly unbelievable doesn't begin to describe her attempts to play captain). However, against these odds a more convincing female captain I cannot imagine (when she isn't forced to deliver corny one liners). She manages to retain a feminine quality while simultaneously displaying tomboyish and oft crude mannerisms that make her character very believable whether issuing commands, wielding a gun/sword, or performing one of the movies many stunts. She quickly makes gender a non-issue (no easy feat) and I actually found myself having a great time watching this movie and her role as it went on.- Matthew Modine Bottom-of-the-barrel actor as many reviews describe him when compared to whom the director preferred to play the leading male (Tom Cruise, et al). Personally, I found him to be one of the easier characters to like, often providing some humor to an otherwise serious cast. His performance and appearance reminds me of Cary Elwes in Princess Bride.- Cinematography The movie is shot with a raw-like quality that seems to be lacking polish or post-production touch-up. Released in 1995, but feels like your watching something from the late 70s-early 80s. Relies on traditional pyrotechnics and stunt work as opposed to fancy CGI effects. While originally apprehensive I soon found this style a bit refreshing as it gave a more ad-hoc feel akin to things like The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular (Youtube it!). In addition, it made for a few unintentionally funny moments like Modine getting clubbed over the head during an escape sequence with a flying barrel from an ill-planned explosion effect? Unfortunately, this form soon showed its limitations. The naval battle at the end is a prime example. Beyond belief is probably the best way to describe it. Two ships at pointblank range broadsiding each other for 5-mins and no visible damage aside from a few makeshift fire-pits on the deck? Yikes! It destroyed the mood and brought my excitement level to a screeching halt, which was finally beginning to recover after the disappointing treasure discovery scenes (scenes where unrealistic extravagance was sorely needed). To say the entire ending was botched is an understatement. It was embarrassingly executed visually and continuity-wise especially considering its budget and 1995 release date. A lot of the blame can be placed on poor script and stunt planning. Watching Captain Morgan and Dawg awkwardly climb the mast for dramatic effect or conveniently place ammunitions topped off with an out of character, Bad Dog! one liner was just one of many things that left me scratching my head.In the end I'd say some of this movies most endearing qualities were the very things that limited its potential to attract an audience or deliver in key moments. Its truly a shame as this movie had the potential to be so much more. Despite its shortcomings, however, I was entertained and impressed far more than I ever imagined when I sat down to watch the biggest box-office bust of all-time and would recommend at least one viewing even if it means having to sit through its cheese-ball ending.

Either peole were NOT interested, or the very first viewers told all their friends to avoid at all costs. While it's not a terrible film, in the end Cutthroat Island amounts to little more that a string of clich√©s, which attempts to take us back to the days of Errol Flynn, but instead becomes a rip-off.Scene one introduces us to Morgan Adams, a cunning young lady and a tough pirate. Shortly after the opening credits end, her father dies, but before he does, he makes Morgan captain of his ship, and gives her a piece of a map. It is a map to Cutthroat Island, where a massive treasure is supposedly buried. The map piece she has however is in Latin, and no one aboard speaks or reads it. They sail to Port Royal in hopes of finding a slave who speaks it. They find and purchase one, Dr. William Shaw, arrested for thievery. The next step is to find the other two pieces of the map, and one of them is in the hands of Morgan's evil uncle, 'Dog' who also wants the treasure. It now becomes a race for the gold and glitter. Meanwhile, the Royal navy has set out to catch Morgan.Cutthroat Island offers everything you might expect. There is sword play, gun play, jailbreaks, storms at sea, ship battles, and booty. All of this however is presented in a mediocre way. Most of the action scenes are unconvincing, badly choreographed, and too much is in slow-mo, especially during the climax.Next there is the problem of acting and characterization. What Geena Davis does is not acting, it is play acting. Her character amounts to little more than a girl who can wield a sword, and command a crew. Matthew Modine as Shaw is equally two-dimensional, although he is occasionally quirky. Frank Langella as a villain does nothing but growl and sneer. He doesn't even look like a pirate. His haircut for instance is too short, and would not be possible without a modern electric razor.On the positive side, at least it's watchable. Seeing as the film is mostly one action scene after another, you keep watching just to see what happens next, but it never gets better. I doubt it will be long before Cutthroat Island fades into oblivion, considering it is the biggest financial loss to this day. While it is not the worst movie, oblivion is probably where it belongs.

CUTTHROAT ISLAND is loud and dumb, and in spite of ridiculous dialogue there is almost non-stop action for over two hours. Morgan Adams(Geena Davis)is the pronounced captain of a pirate ship sailing the Caribbean in the mid 1660s. Adams and her motley crew are hunting for the treasure of millions of pounds of gold buried on Cutthroat Island. The problem is that she has only a third of the treasure map. Another third of the map is held by her Uncle Dawg Brown(Frank Langella)who would rather fight or even kill his niece for sole possession of the riches. William Shaw(Matthew Modine)is an odd sort of swashbuckler that reinforces the winsome female pirate in her search for the other third of the map as well as the fog swallowed Cutthroat Island.It is evident Davis worked hard in this stunt filled flick. However there seems to be no chemistry between the pairing of Davis with Modine. Modine was given the job when Michael Douglas bowed out due to Davis' beefier role. Langella seems at times trying for a laugh than be the menacing villain he is expected to be. Davis at most times is 99% eye candy. There is good support acting from Stan Shaw, Rex Linn and Angus Wright.  The movie offers some breathtaking visuals; the best being the explosion of Dawg Brown's ship. I also liked the brief scene of a crew member getting his foot tangled in the anchor chain and going overboard. The London Symphony Orchestra provides a rousing score; but all of the energetic action could not save this movie...it bankrupted Carolco Pictures.

So I thought I'd take out the DVD and watch the movie. Here where I knew that my book would have to be rewritten. I can definitely see why this sank the Carolco ship. 1) Everyone is miscast. I have never seen a movie with worse casting than this - Davis doesn't look/sound/act like a pirate. The scene where she climbs over the rock after the jump is fantastic for obvious reasons, but she still doesn't cut it as a pirate. The question of believability is not that of can a woman be a pirate captain but rather how can this woman be a pirate captain? And there could have been many answers she is like a mother to them or they are all in love with her or she is a b-tch from hell and they are scared of her, or a combination of the above. Unfortunately, the movie gives us no credible answer, and neither does Davis' performance. Modine is trying to be what Matthew McConaughey would have become a few years later. Problem is - he is no McConaughey, although he is trying really hard. Langella doesn't look or act like a pirate - he seems to be more of an army major at a boot camp. At some stage I almost expected him to check his wrist for a watch and shout You have 40 seconds, now move it soldiers! Stan Shaw's role is probably supposed to be comic relief. Otherwise, I can't understand the idea with the ridiculous Jamaican accent. Unfortunately, there is nothing funny about his role or his delivery, so the joke becomes on him. Even the extras are miscast! During a flyover scene of the ship you can clearly see the actors struggling to climb down the Jacob's ladders - was it really that hard to find actors who could manage it a bit better?2) The dialogue and realism. This is a PIRATE movie. They are supposed to use naval terms. Their speech is supposed to be peppered with swearing. It doesn't have to be R-rated, because there are ways to stylise speech without degrading it with F-words, but the dialogue in CTI was not stylised at all - it just sounded like a bunch of people talking on a morning train on the way to work. This, however, is a minor problem, compared to the overall level of dialogue, interactions and humour in this film. From the balls jokes to wash your mouth to the final I want to see you in my quarters, it was just cringe-worthy. 3) Action sequences. Could someone in this crew do a bit of research? What canon balls were used for battles, how enemy ships were boarded, what a sailing ship looks like in battle, for heaven's sake? Why is a ship intact after a broadside-to=broadside battle? Why are the masts still standing? Honestly, I am not a navy historian, but for anyone who read C.S.Forrester as a child these scenes are mind boggling. And don't get me started with the Why's? on the final duel - that scene is just below criticism. Then there is the lack of blood. For some reason the director decided that it's OK to have blood and injuries that the protagonists suffer, but there should be no blood in battles. That's fine, but then the battles should be choreographed in a way that doesn't require blood. Instead, we see close-ups of people getting stabbed through with sabers, only to see a perfect clean blade when it is pulled out. In some instances the movie doesn't even try to make the impression - you see people getting killed by getting slapped on their backs with sabers. Production values, anyone?Finally, I feel sorry for John Debney. He composed a wonderful score for a movie bad beyond salvation. If only this score would have been used for Pirates of the Caribbean instead of that awful stuff by Trevor Rabin it would have been so much more fitting a good score and a good movie. And I wouldn't have had to rewrite the rules in my book.Bottom line - 3/10. 1 for the score, 1 for the Geena Davis scene after the jump and 1 for the monkey.

It stars Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, Frank Langella, Maury Chaykin, Patrick Malahide, Stan Shaw and Rex Linn. Music is scored by John Debney and cinematography by Peter Levy.A film of many flaws, with a reputation akin to it being the devil of big budget failures, it is, however, a wonderful piece of piratical entertainment if you are prepared to see past the monetary excess. Famously cited as the film that bankrupted Caroloco Pictures, the truth is that Carolco was going under anyway, the studio had filed for bankruptcy before Cutthroat Island had even been released, the box office performance was irrelevant, it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. And while no amount of hard sell marketing could have gotten the film to make back the $98 million spent making it, it received no support from distributor MGM who were in the process of being sold, so finances for marketing were not available.Harlin's movie has all the pirate movie ingredients crammed in to the plot, though it is a standard plot that sees Davis as female pirate Morgan Adams who leads her charges on a quest to find the ultimate treasure hoard. Problem is that the map is in three parts, each part held by separate people, one of which is Morgan's vicious Uncle Dawg (Langella). The hunt and race is on, and Harlin doesn't pause for breath, he's a kid in a sweet shop armed with wads of cash, but the money, as gargantuan as it is, is there on the screen; well except for the hiring of better actors that is. Two magnificent ships were built for the production and they are magnificent, the costumes, the sets, pyrotechnics, exotic locations (Malta and Thailand standing in for 1668 Jamaica), stunning sound editing and visual thrills, all high on value and all cloaked by a tremendously robust score from Debney.Action junkies are well served here, with wild horse drawn carriage chases, sword fights aplenty, ships in side by side explosive battle, mucho perilous situations, bodies falling from heights or thrown in the sea, and we even get a comic relief simian! Who, as it turns out, is one of the best actors on show. It's hard to believe that a pirate action film such as this would not be better appreciated had it been released in the last ten years, and I say that not just because of the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, but more so that the blunderbuss popcorn movie has greater support these days. There's a good portion of the movie loving faithful who just want to be entertained, where rapid thrills are a requisite, not well drawn characterisations and thespian class. Judged on those terms then Cutthroat Island is a winner for sure.Main problems are the clunky script and the three pronged miscast errors in the lead roles. Davis (erm, wife of Harlin) is full of guts, really attacking the material with gusto, but she never convinces, it always feels like a caricature and she's uncomfortable delivering key lines. She would prove herself a fine action actress a year later with The Long Kiss Goodnight (also with Harlin directing), but she's woefully out of place here. With Davis demanding more and more screen time for her character, the role of Shaw began to thin out, which was too much to bear for Michael Douglas who bowed out late in the day. In came Matthew Modine, zero chemistry with Davis, a bland acting style and as far removed from the period setting as you could get. Langella just isn't menacing as the main villain of the piece, a very good actor in the right role, but not here and some of his attempts at nastiness feel like panto season has started early.Problems for sure, but wade through some of the misconceptions and poisonous press and you will find a film desperately aiming to please you, with much on offer for the pirate movie fan to savour. 7/10 "},{"Title":"One of the all time greatest pirate films ever made!","Date":"13 July 2003","Score":"11 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  One film I added to my Best Films of 1995 list!!I still don't know why this film was never a hit.

As we all know the stakes of Carolco, was a total failure that led to the same production of emblematic films in the history of cinema as Terminator 2, Total Recall and Basic Instinct, economic collapse causing their demise. Views today, hard to believe that a film with so much budget, familiar faces and a classic story and easy to assimilate not only cause concern in most of the public. Especially if we note that the film is a simply brutal media deployment. The beautiful scenery, atmosphere of the sixteenth century, explosions, chases, battles at sea, well ..... certainly can not say that it lacks spectacular. Then, because that way the film crashed at the box office? what went wrong?.One factor, I think, is the simplicity argument. We tell the story of treasure and such, but there is no narrative depth, nor the characters, the story seems more an excuse to show the large budget that had, with dozens of chase scenes and sword fights that have a story. The funny thing is that movies now do exactly the same, but much worse than this but to have success, so perhaps this factor is not as important. I think another factor to consider is Geena Davis. Her work in the film is good and meritorious, but the problem is that the majority of the public simply does not believe in heroin, as simple as that. There was an actress that people imagine in such roles, despite their efforts to show otherwise, as would later in Lethal Memory. And finally, perhaps the most important of all, was overconfidence. Simply did not think the failure, which prevents a filmmaker always think, even though I know not to do it. Both the producer and the director Renny Harlin, began to commit excesses, they spend money on superficial things and whims of the director with his partner, as the story of the white donkey imported from Malta, where the tape was filmed in the United States, or the improvised script, which they say was written at the same rate at which it rolled. In short, squandered and squandered what they wanted, completely blind until the subsequent disaster due to open their eyes. However, despite all this, the failure of the film is justified. I think not. Come have said the film is a very entertaining adventure story which is enjoyed without problems and that does not give rise to boredom. It is possible that if instead of Mathew Modine, had put an actor with more hook at the box office, Michael Douglas, for example, could have changed anything, but it's only a guess. Keep in spoilers. spoiler Perhaps this film was destined to fail because it was released at a time when the genre of Pirates was practically dead, and the film was condemned by almost everyone for not having enough acting hook, a campaign of poor publicity and too superficial history and simple, although it is a completely repeat spectacular and entertaining film before the era of digital cinema.

More importantly, she acquires one-third of a treasure map. The map's location reveals the answer to the question, Why did men in the 17th century wear thick, long-haired wigs. Of course, it's because they had treasure maps tattooed to their scalps. Probably, you did not know that. Baldness was also a problem back then, as the scalp map was written in Latin to discourage common spectators. Not well-versed in Latin, Ms. Davis must buy a slave to help translate the treasure map...Recently sentenced to slavery after stealing a woman's jewels, handsome blond-haired Matthew Modine (as William Shaw) is called into service. Not only does he read and speak Latin, he's also good at doctoring and kissing. A jack-of-all-trades slave, Mr. Modine quickly comes into possession of another third of the treasure map. The last third is kept by dastardly Frank Langella (as Douglas Dawg Brown). Davis and Modine must put the three pieces together, but Mr. Langella isn't cooperating. In fact, he would rather kill Davis and Modine, then keep all of the treasure for himself...King Charles (the monkey), Chris Masterson (as Bowen), Rex Linn (as Blair) and Stan Shaw (as Glasspoole) are supportive. Davis doesn't seem like a bad choice for the lead, even when you consider she was Mr. Harlin's wife. But her performance is far too indirect. Modine is appropriately less masculine. Even with its faults, this should have been a better picture for director Renny Harlin and his crew. Sure, it's crammed and cramped, but there is enough action to bring people into the theaters. While too blaring and bombastic, it might have been a hit in more pirate-friendly waters.***** Cutthroat Island (12/22/95) Renny Harlin ~ Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, Frank Langella, Chris Masterson "},{"Title":"captain davis","Date":"25 November 2012","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" i never that this movie had flopped in the theaters,, i was reading someone's comments and i was like wow it shouldn't have,, ig guess the times back then wasn't really ready for a swashbuckling female captain,, geena davis did do a decent job,, matthew modine was alright,, probably cud have used someone a little better to compliment geena. the premise wasn't bad,, makes you wander if pirates of the Caribbean took some of this and made it their own,, o well food for thought ,, overall this isn't a bad movie,, it has it's decent moment,, but it's not a great movie either, it's like right in the middle of the road so that's why i rated it a 5.

Six writers worked on this would-be pirate epic, an expensive box-office debacle credited with ruining Carolco Pictures. Substituting funny bluster and swagger with explosive action (execrably staged), the picture gets nowhere quickly. Geena Davis has class and sass to spare, but director Renny Harlin overworks her natural appeal. Davis should never have to labor so hard to give us the goods. The actress isn't convincing as a femme swashbuckler, but we know she's capable of giving a fun, attractive performance; Harlin's monotonous staging and strident tone pretty much sabotages the actress until she appears literally in over-her-head. Matthew Modine, an educated slave who joins Geena for adventure and romance, somehow equates smarm with charm, while Frank Langella (as Dawg!) keeps creeping in and out, his voice a grating croak. Film should have been full of robust, hard-boiled whimsy, but Harlin doesn't have the right touch.

Therefore, since only the box office blockbusters seem to make it over here, I did not have a chance to see this in the theater. Somehow, I seemed to have missed it when it came out in California. Nonetheless, I have seen it here on TV a couple times. The first time I saw it was just after I had seen The Pirates of the Caribbean (POTC) and I thought it was made afterwards in an effort to be as good or better than POTC. Then I came to IMDb and I was surprised to find that it was actually done so many years ago and I hadn't known about it. I do not think it was better than POTC, but it is certainly every bit as good, and Geena Davis does an excellent job of portraying what Anne Bonny must have been like as a pirate. If you are a Geena Davis fan, I would say that this is a MUST SEE. I personally thought she did a much, much better job on this movie than she did as the lame-brained Larry in Fletch or the saccharine-sweet mommy in the Stewart Little movies.I have noticed that most of the people posting on the message board about Geena Davis have said that they think the role should have gone to someone else (a male) because 1) she is a woman, 2) she was the ship's captain, and 3) she had pearly white teeth.Being a woman pirate IS historical, but most people do not know about it. There WAS a general rule that there were to be no women aboard because it was considered bad luck and it was often considered such a grievous sin that any man disobeying the rule would be immediately put to death. Nonetheless, there WERE a few women pirates who were smuggled aboard dressed in men's clothing. However, they had to know how to pull it off by fighting like a man. Two women of notoriety were Anne Bonny and Mary Read, who were both smuggled aboard by the captain himself, Calico Jack Rackham. You can find biographies about all three of these pirates (among others) at several websites under the keyword pirates.So far as Geena Davis not being convincing because she was a woman playing a pirate -- a Captain at that, in the Trivia for Cutthroat Island, IMDb tell us the following The flag flown by Morgan Adams was in reality the flag flown by Calico Jack Rackham, one of the only Caribbean Pirates to have women on his crew; Anne Bonny and Mary Read. He later turned his ship over to the two women. With that in mind, wouldn't it be more than safe to assume that this must have been the catalyst in writing this movie, and therefore, the movie would most likely have been written as a fantasy of what it would be like to have a woman pirate as the ship's captain?The pearly white teeth thing is also believable because, after all, women pirates were few and far between, and when they were aboard, it was in their teenaged years and because they were smuggled on in men's clothing and they were bound to be caught soon, I would imagine that they would have had pearly white teeth. By the way, where did the idea come from that all pirates had rotten teeth?I wonder if the reason that this movie did not make it in the box office is because of the woman pirate concept. If that is the case, why don't the critics bother to get out their history books or surf the web to find out if there WERE any women pirates in the annals of history?I wonder if they would have begun the movie with a written history of women pirates, and if they would have stated that the flag that Geena Davis flew in the movie was the authentic flag that was flown by the woman pirate, Anne Bonny, if that would have added creditability to the movie--especially if it were read by some famous celebrity. On the other hand, the name of the movie is everything, so I wonder if the name Cutthroat Island was to its demise. Perhaps if this movie were called Pirates of the Caribbean and backed by Disney Studios, it would have been a smash hit. Too bad it wasn't.

Dying from his injuries Harry tells Morgan where the map is & to use his pirate ship & crew to find the treasure, Morgan agrees & sets out to find the other two pieces of the map, one is held by her uncle Mordachai Fingers (George Murcell) & the other by the vicious Dawg who also want the pieces of the map. Morgan & Dawg race against each other to work the clues out & set sail for Cutthroat Island where the treasure is hidden, the British army not fond of pirates are also along for the ride as the winner takes all...This American, French, Italian & German co-production was produced & directed by Renny Harlin straight after his success with the excellent Cliffhanger (1993) which sort of explains why the production company gave him complete control to do whatever he wanted, well actually it doesn't does it? Anyway, already widely known as one of the biggest financial flops of all time (it cost over $100 million but made just over $10 million) this swashbuckling pirate action adventure film is one that I have seen several times & admit that I've enjoyed it each & every time. While Cutthroat Island is far from perfect it's great at what it sets out to be, a loud, fast paced action adventure centered on pirates, sword-fights, mysterious islands, stolen treasure & lots of simple comic book style character's. The typical Hollywood role reversal where the leading action star is a woman & has a man as her sidekick makes an unusual twist even if nothing is done with the idea apart from some smutty one-liners. At just under two hours maybe it's a little long & there really isn't enough plot here to justify that duration, Morgan reaches Cutthroat Island about an hour into the film & then it's her against Dawg & the British army with none stops fights, explosions & corny dialogue. I'm not sure people spoke like this back then, the script is a little wooden with cardboard character's but overall Cutthroat Island is good fun & it's a pity they don't make visually spectacular action adventure films such as this anymore.I assume much of the colossal budget went on production design & it show's with gorgeous locations, sets & period production design. There are some great action scenes too, Morgan single handedly destroys two entire towns in her quest for the treasure & there's some quite violent fights with lots of clanging swords, rifles & even huge cannons being used. Michael Douglas was originally set to star in Cutthroat Island but pulled out saying the Geena Davis character was expanded at the expense of his. Oliver Reed was originally cast as Mordechai Fingers but was fired after getting into a bar fight & mooning at Geena Davis (!). Director Renny Harlin was dating Geena Davis at the time & managed to convince the studio that she should take the lead role despite never having made an action film before. Carolco Pictures who had financed Cutthroat Island filed for bankruptcy three weeks before it opened in theatres, quite why they spent so much on it remains a mystery.With a supposed budget of about $115,000,000 there's a lot of visual flair on screen with exploding pirate ships, entire period towns, daring stunts, numerous fights, huge set-pieces & plenty of exotic locations. Filmed in Malta, England & Thailand. The acting is alright, no-one puts in a great performance but no-one is overly bad.Cutthroat Island was a massive flop for sure but it's actually a pretty decent action adventure film that I have always liked watching, who would have though the similarly themed Pirates of the Caribbean films would go on to become such box-office hits. I liked it, a bit shallow but still very enjoyable.

The production values are great, but the flick lacks a real sense of energy. The directing isn't bad either, but everything feels fabricated and not in a fun way.The basic tale of 'let's get the gold before they do' with the minor twist of having a female pirate as the lead is the sole thing that sets 'Cutthroat Island' apart. It pulls no surprises, there's an obligatory revenge subplot and the whole thing felt very long in the tooth by the time it had ended. Gigantic action set pieces can only get you so far. Cutthroat Island is like 'Waterworld' in many ways. An expensive sea faring adventure long forgotten by many with the best of intentions in mind. It's not horrible, but noteworthy? Not really.

On TV the feeling is the same.  The plot is a treasure hunt, but it never really sets the pulses racing or feels like it is a really fun romp or such.  Instead the story telling is rather workmanlike without spark or life.What exists in it's place is a lot of noise and energy &#150; but it is energy that is misdirected and misplaced in this case.  The action scenes look very expensive (when a lavish harbour town is destroyed you can see the budget) but the also lack excitement or tension.  Instead they are hollow spectacles.  I'm not a big fan of Harlin's work.  Cliffhanger was OK but Die Hard 2 was the weakest of the series.  Here he can't seem to find the excitement in his action &#150; maybe because some much effort was on the design of effects shots than on reasons for the action.Davis is OK in the lead role but it is easy to think of a couple of actresses that might have been more convincing playing it tough.  Modine has a few lines that suggest his character will be better than he actually is.  Despite a few witty moments of banter early on he just becomes a bland character.  Langella is OK but only because he has a reasonable screen presence rather than having a great character.Overall this is dull and not very engaging at all.  The action is hollow and the plot/characters have nothing to really grip.  Not worth it's awful reputation but certainly not really worth watching.

An unfairly-maligned epic pirate tale. As you watch and enjoy this rollicking adventure, realize that it's a homage to all those over-the-top salty sea dog flicks of the 30s-40s. Nicely done. One of the best pirate flicks of all time.

Next, Geena Davis, I mean, honestly, the most knock-em- around gal I have ever seen in this sort of film! Davis, having strong outlook from Thelma & Louise is an all out butt-kicking pirate-babe!

The acting is old-fashionably outlandish, and often fierce, but this IS a pirate movie...no one ever fight more hard for pride.

Not only do we get the usual sonic boom as fist brushes face or soft stomachs, we're also subjected to the sound of swords being drawn; each time accompanied by the sound of metal being dragged over stone.

However there is a catch Her Uncle Dawg(Langella) is after the treasure too, and will stop at nothing to steal it from his niece, with swashbuckling adventurous results. This film is a great gem of a movie, and what a pirate film should be. Now a days you have films like Pirates of the Caribbean that take all the money at the box office, and get nominated for Academy Awards, but this film is all that one would hope for in a pirate movie. Geena Davis turns is a very credible performance as Morgan Adams, the female pirate with an attitude and a look that could kill. She creates a character that the audience can root for, as she kicks butt through the movie and delivers one liners that, while some might consider lame(You like to was things? Start with your mouth!) Are effective in the end due to honest portrayal. Real sex appeal too. Some of the scenes involving water are really satisfying to the male audience. One great thing for money making, but it is done artistically as well. Matthew Modine is fun as the slave Shaw, whom is hired to translate a map founded by Davis. He plays his role out as annoying but with a little wit and charm. The best part of this film can be said to be Patrick Malahide as the canning Gov. Ainslee. This is a real funny character, while not much in the film, steals every scene he is in. Langella is a treat as the villain of the film, Captain Dawg. Very vile and reptilish, something that heroin Davis can play off of. The direction is superb. Renny Harlin had done his fair share of action films prior to this film so he really knew what he was doing. With a budget like the one this film has how can an action director go wrong! I really enjoyed his style. Especially in the first chase scene. The music is the heart of the film, as composer John Debney created an all too wonderful score to play with Morgan and her mates as they sail to victory, to the battles of the evil Dawg, to the beautiful opening credits which photograph Malta all too beautifully. Possibly one of the ten best scores of the nineties, this soundtrack soars with beauty and swashbuckling adventure and not a song is to be missed! The cinematography is to be mentioned too, as the cliffs of Malta and wherever else this film was shot are brought out to aesthetic ebullience!All in all, this film has all that a film goer can want in an action film It has action, sex appeal, excitement, danger, widescreen, and a great ending!

This sounds like a great film, an Indiana Jones for the 90's.  But let me tell you this  Renny Harlin is no Steven Spielberg and Geena Davis ( what a joke ) cannot even carry Harry's fedora.Cutthroat Island is a terrible film.  It is easy to see where the 92 million dollars was spent, but that does not mean it was spent wisely.  Great pains went into set design, costume design, locales, and probably the catering.  Where they did not spend it was on a good script or a first rate cast.  I mean come on, Geena Davis as the toughest bitch you have ever seen since Ripley in Aliens is a stretch.  But to be fair, if that is what the producer was thinking, then he should have his head examined.  Look at it this way, Weaver started her career as a tough cookie and then built her resume from there.  That is why she is believable in the tough role of Ripley.  But Geena Davis all of a sudden tried to reinvent herself as an action star.  Her roles were generally typical women roles.  So why cast her as the tough as nails FEMALE hero in the story?Now this may sound incredibly sexist but why was the hero a woman in the first place?  What hero has been a woman in a movie like this?  Don't you think that it gives the film a squalid taste to put a woman in the role that was probably written for a man in the first place?  Let's be realistic here, I don't believe that she could beat up every man that tried to subdue her.  I don't believe for one second that she could take a bullet wound in the stomach and still run, jump, swordfight, battle, swim and then fall down from exhaustion only after she was safely on her boat.  I just don't buy it.But the main part of the problem has to be Renny Harlin.  I have to admit that I was very impressed with Die Hard II and Cliffhanger, but this excuse for a film is pathetic.  Action is always better when it serves a purpose.  Here it is a nuisance and it gets cumbersome very fast.  In fact I would say that the action in the film is it's worst quality.  If you are going to invest almost 100 million bucks into a film, shouldn't you make sure that it is at least fun, competent, and maybe a little enjoyable?  Just a mild observation.  Action can't just be about blow ups and chases and guns and fights and swords.  Action has to have some sort of a build up, some sort of meaning.  It should further the plot of the film, not hinder it.  Cutthroat Island has none of that and doesn't understand what action means.  Renny Harlin was lucky not to be ostracized from Hollywood with this lame, banal and just plain awful effort.To sum it up, it should have been a man in the lead, it should have ended an hour earlier, and Harlin should take directing lessons from Spielberg before he attempts a project of this nature.  3 out of 10-- a truly awful and disgustingly inept film.  Avoid at all costs.  Wow, what an awful film!  An awful awful film.Did I mention it was awful?  Just checking.

It is not an outright classic by any stretch of the imagination, but neither was it as awful as they have stated themselves. It is at most an OK film that is fun and entertaining to watch. I think though that the most of the critics condemnation of this film was directed more towards the budget of the special effects, costumes, the large ships which were built etc, as opposed to the standard of the film's narrative itself. However, the slating this film received was a little too harsh.Geena Davis plays heroine Morgan, whose 'tough as nails' approach attracts the attention of Matthew Modine's William- a thief who longs to be part of the adventure and together the pair set foot to avenge the death of Morgan's father and to get their hands on the treasure. Davis was very good, whilst I thought with Modine's performances, whilst it was okay, i'd have expected more from him in that role. Some of the scenes in the film did drag on a bit too long though, whereas some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, which is a criticism of Cutthroat Island, but otherwise other than Pirates of the Caribbean there have been not that many swashbuckling, pirate based movies made for the big screen.It is definitely not as bad as the reputation it first received when it came out and I have seen much worser films than this. Overall, Cutthroat Island is an okay movie- although with the colossal big bucks being spent on the film, it is a little disappointing to see that the film's extraordinary budget didn't really translate into success on screen, in regards to the story. Which is a bit of a shame given that the scenery and locations of the film looked spectacular.If you do see it, then do so with an open mind and do not expect it to be anything like Pirates of the Caribbean.

Starring Oscar winner Geena Davis, Oscar nominated Frank Langella and&#x85;umm&#x85;Matthew Modine, Cutthroat Island is the tall tale of a female pirate captain (Geena Davis) attempting to find the fabled titular island before her heinous uncle (also a pirate captain and also Frank Langella) does. The key to her triumph; a con artist named Shaw (Modine) who knows Latin and can translate the map.This movie is about as boilerplate as one can get. The characters are one dimensional, the dialogue stilted, the special effects; a masterwork in bombastic nineties ridiculousness. Yet there's something near-magical about this particular train wreck. Nearly ever scene has explosions and sword fighting mayhem all of which are well choreographed if sloppily done.Geena Davis tries her absolute hardest to pull off her Captain Morgan (yes her name is Captain Morgan), a lord knows her 6 foot frame would have made her an obvious choice for hard fighting buccaneer. I commend her for the physicality she brings to the role managing to get punched in the face and break through candy glass unfazed. But her elegance and beauty betray her. Her smiles are always genuine and her body language is always feminine; maybe the demeanor of a bourgeois suffragette at the turn of the century but not that of a bloodthirsty rogue pirate.Most of the blame for this film's so-bad-it's-good quality lies squarely with the director Renny Harlin who also directed the recent clunker The Legend of Hercules (2014). Harlin comes from the school of grandiose action films before CGI. Like Guy Hamilton and John McTiernan before him, swift, consistent flow of action takes precedence over story, human characters and all the other little things that don't matter. They accomplish this with elaborate set pieces, daring stunt work and, as mentioned before, lots and lots of explosions. Unlike Hamilton and McTiernan, Harlin has no artistic instinct behind the camera. The cinematography is grimy and brown and the set, while expensive looking is nevertheless noticeably fake. It's as if Harlin wanted to update the swashbucklers of Douglas Fairbanks yet didn't bother to update anything except for the actors.Then there's the writing which is borderline absurd. What passes for witty one-liners, are groan worthy puns and non-sequiturs with little bearing on anything of consequence. Everything else is exposition. It's as if the six writers of the film all hated each other, were trapped in a room together, unable to leave until they came up with something and poised to be overly critical of everything the other said and did. What's left is a script with no creativity or panache. In being so bland the authors of this rubbish commit the cardinal sin of writing letting the audience notice the exposed frame of the writing instead of the action on the screen.Yet, at the end of the day, Cutthroat Island is too harebrained to be taken seriously. If you go in with low expectation and a tendency to not take yourself or your films seriously, you might come out of a viewing on top. There is intrinsic value in watching a movie like Cutthroat Island, especially if you plan on going into a career in film. Movies like this serve to make you acutely aware of what not to do.http//www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Generic","Date":"7 September 2009","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" If someone had told me in the mid-90s that they were planning on making a movie based on the Disneyland ride Pirates of the Caribbean, Cutthroat Island is what I probably would have imagined every pirate movie clich√© shoved into one overlong movie with a rip-off Korngold score and lots of bland action. Luckily, the people who took the seemingly impossible task of turning one of Disneyland's worst rides into a movie did good on it.

Besides its general blandness, Harlin makes the huge mistake of putting his wife Gena Davis in the lead. She plays a pirate captain, and is never at all believable. Matthew Modine provides no help as the uncharismatic male lead, a role wisely turned down by at least five other actors beforehand. The action is often ludicrous.

It's much more convincing than having some Hollywood queen who is completely foreign to a little dirt, grime and action.  The fact that there isn't a wealth of recent pirate movies sits Cutthroat Island near the top of the heap, but I don't think it's unjustified.  It really is a fun movie, and that's what a pirate movie should be.  How can you have a completely serious pirate movie?  It wouldn't be any fun. You have to have a guy with a wooden leg, some kind of pet-be it a parrot or a monkey, and guys that say aye and arg.  The ship to ship cannon fight is amazing.  The simple reminder that seaborne warfare was like that once is amazing enough.  Just pull up and start blowing the trash out of each other at close range.  A far cry from today, where we just fire missiles at targets dozens of miles away.  Flintlock pistols and sword fights are always cool, and Cutthroat Island has its fair share of them.  I enjoyed Matthew Modine's character, but I admit at times his lines seemed an uncomfortable fit, as though they were shoehorned in. The rest of the supporting cast is effective, and Frank Langella as Morgan's despicable uncle is the typical bad pirate, but enjoyable none the less.Pirates of the Carribean is coming out a few months from the time I am writing this, and it will be interesting to see if and how the two movies are compared.  If you haven't seen Cutthroat Island, rent it and sit back and enjoy the action.  As I've mentioned several times, it's a movie meant to be fun, and I believe it is.

It had the budget, and the talent, to be great, and thus it was expected that it would live up to that potential. Alas, it did not, and the biggest problem was that it seems that no one bothered to read the script out loud before giving it to the actors.The special effects were excellent if overdone -- never has naval action looked better.  Doesn't matter that explosive cannonballs weren't invented for another several hundred years -- the fireballs look good.  However, besides the special effects and the absolutely outstanding soundtrack, this movie has not much going for it.Geena Davis, normally quite a good actress, seemed completely uninspired throughout most of the movie.  The other actors were mostly competent, but just weren't given any materiel to work with.  Probably seventy percent of the dialogue in this movie was stupid one-liners or banter that advanced the plot not at all, and what was left just wasn't very appealing.  The characters never developed, they just seemed to jump from action sequence to action sequence, indestructible and unfazable as only action movie heroes can be.  And the plot of the movie was basically a big plothole.Still, if that had been expected, this movie would have been good eye candy. But I expected so much more.  With a good script, good direction, a little more realism, and some character development, this movie could have been outstanding, possible one of the best 10 films of the century, depending on your taste.  And those modifications could have been done without any extra cost...in fact, cutting down on the overblown explosions would've cut costs. So its just a big shame that the potential was wasted.

Unfortunately nowadays, kids these days don't seem to have the patience for a good old-fashioned swashbuckler which is a real shame, because in my estimation Cutthroat Island has over 10 times as many fights that are at least 100 times more exciting than anything you'll find in mainstream sci-fi pap like The Phantom Menace. Besides, what looks better, blasting someone in the stomach to end their life immediately or clashing swords with your opponent, elegantly hacking them up a piece at a time with a touch of class? I know which one I'd take anytime. Anyway, Cutthroat Island is a throwback to the glory days of Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and as a both an adventure and pirate movie, it largely succeeds.

It is the kind of swashbuckler that does not get made anymore. Geena Davis makes a brilliant Morgan Adams, the ruthless pirate daughter of Black Harry, searching for the legenday treasure of Cutthroat Island, pursued by her father's killer, and her uncle, Captain Dawg. Matthew Modine is her love interest and side kick, a would-have-been-slave till Morgan 'rescues' him because he is the only one who can decipher the map leading to the treasure.

The special effects were spectacular. Attention to detail was excellent. A lot of research was done to make sure that the weapons, the costumes, etc. were done to perfection. As for Captain Morgan Adams' pearly white teeth, not all pirates had rotten teeth.

So I wrongfully gave it a pass. It also seemed odd to me that the swashbuckler genre would make a comeback in the mid 90s. It just seemed so out of place. Years later (yesterday in fact) I bought a cheap used DVD of the film, and after a couple of viewings I think I understand what happened.I remember the ads for this film looked good, yet everyone seemed to trash it after it came out. How could a period sea-adventure-epic fall flat on its face? Why were audiences only marginally Luke warm to a film that has some of the most spectacular production values I or anyone else had seen in a long time? Particularly when it was exceptionally well shot and had a solid cast behind it? I'll be blunt. Geena Davis is no Anne Bonnie. She looks the part, but doesn't grab the role with both hands. She goes through it, acts the part, but doesn't become the part. She's more or less being one of the guys on the set. She has some flourishes, but I honestly believe she was mis cast. The Morgan character needed to be dynamic from page one, but Geena Davis really doesn't give us that--in-spite of being a capable thespian that she is. She isn't tomboyish enough nor feminine enough. Morgan needed to be exchanging insults and intrigues with the crew. Drinking them under the table like the Marion character in Raiders of the Lost Ark. She needed to be target practicing and getting into the occasional brawl. She needed to be bawdy and animated. But Geena Davis instead gives us a feminine 17th century naval captain out of the British tradition. She's not so much a pirate as a naval officer whose been thrust on a pirate vessel. In retrospect Geena Davis may have been trying to give us a woman exuding reserved masculinity, but it doesn't quite mesh with the film.Mathew Modine does an okay job. Looking at his and Davis'es character, one clearly sees an intentional role reversal being played. But again it doesn't seem to gybe (to borrow from nautical parlance) with the rest of the film. Modine needed to be the modern male in need of a woman. Instead he's assigned the role of a feminine intellectual in constant need of rescue. He's not competing with Davis so much as waiting for her to save him. I think both male and female audiences expected him to be a bit more.The final nail in the coffin is the pacing of some of the action sequences. Again, it's all exceptionally well photographed, but there lulls in the pacing. The super-majority of it is well done, but there's maybe a handful of mis-edits that combine with some awkward feats on the part of actors and stunt men that don't quite click together. Like I say, for the most part you hardly notice them, and the action as staged is good. But there're a couple of miscues that add to the unimpressive role-reversal theme that I think don't sit well with the audience.All these elements give the viewer a kind of awkward acceptance of the film, but a subconscious refusal to call it a good movie so to speak. Which is a real shame, because this film otherwise has all the earmarks of being an extremely promising production. Some mis-interpretation of the parts by the two main leads fuses with some mis-paced action to render a film a little uneven, but otherwise spectacular.Some improvements; the Morgan character needed a sidekick. A female one too. A few more cutaways during the climactic action sequence, a few less slow-motion shots, and a little more heart and dynamic-ism from the two leads and you have yourself a winner. As it stands now the film is about 85% there.Incredible locations, fantastic costuming, respectable SFX, an exceptional supporting cast, give this film a chance. It's not Master and Commander, but it is respectable Sunday afternoon fare.p.s. It also has an outstanding score.

Basically Morgan Adams (Geena Davis) is the female buccaneer turned captain who recently lost her father Black Harry (Bean's Harris Yulin) after being captured by her nasty uncle Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), and she wants her vengeance. In the meantime however, she and her crew are seeking the mysterious shores and lost treasure on the hidden and uncharted CutThroat Island, but they need three portions of a map to find it. Morgan gains herself a new recruit with slave William Shaw (Full Metal Jacket's Matthew Modine), and while he is confident in her, the rest of the ship's crew may not be, and the quest is made difficult by the Navy, led by Governor Ainslee (The World Is Not Enough's Patrick Malahide), looking for her. Morgan and Shaw work out how to get to CutThroat Island, and the pirate ship, the Morning Star, manages to survive a storm and get there, and on the land they try to follow directions to find the treasure. Of course Dawg manages to find the island as well, and in the process of taking the treasure back to another ship, they steal it for themselves. There is a big battle with two ships and cannons, and one of the ships ends up blown up and sunk, Dawg is killed in action, and the crew get the treasure back, Shaw and his love interest embrace their feelings, and Morgan suggests they sail on to new treasures. Also starring Entrapment's Maury Chaykin as John Reed, Stan Shaw as Glasspoole, Rex Linn as Mr. Blair, Paul Dillon as Snelgrave and Malcolm in the Middle's Christopher Masterson as Bowen. Davis is naturally beautifully and fitfully feisty, Modine is alright as the slave who helps and falls for her, and Langella does fine, the story is your typical treasure hunt full of bangs, frills, costumes and tropical locations. This was made for millions of dollars, and it was one of the biggest box office flops in movie history, there are tiny ways you can see this as it isn't always the most exciting or original pirates film you will see, but at the same time it isn't the worst, a reasonable action adventure.

The story moves quickly with plenty of opportunities to change locations and costumes.  It's shot beautifully.  It sounds great--musket shots, swords being drawn, explosions.

They don't make many pirate movies anymore.  (Critics will say, Watch C.I. & you'll know why.)  But with the current focus on special effect-laden cinema, the pirate/high seas genre is ready to be reborn.  Cutthroat Island is a good start.

Calico Jack commanded the sloop William, and preyed upon ships in the Caribbean (the same area Geena Davis's Morgan Adams prowled about) in early 18th century. During one battle, the William was caught off guard off the western tip of Jamaica by the Governor. Anne Bonney and Mary Reade roused the crew, and led the fight when the William was boarded. Also, the flag used for Morgan's ship, the skull with the two swords, was the same flag used by Calico Jack's William. As far as the film's performance at the box office, what can I say? How many critically acclaimed films have flopped, while the public flocks to see such movies as The Waterboy and Batman and Robin? Yes, the plot was thin, and the dialog was cheesy (I must visit that shop when I have more time!)

But take it she does...not only take it, but Geena did her own stunts, something many of the macho male movie stars do not dare to do.

The forward somersault is amazing because either Davis did it herself or has a twin sister who is a stunt person.The rest of the movie is absolute garbage, with the standard modern day dialogue in the past, and the extremely tired action hero banter and catchphrases, none of which is funny. Did pirates spend so much time keeping their ships in such pristine condition? You'd think that even after going thru a tropical storm there'd be some wear.

It's ticket sales? What the critics say? How many Academy Awards it receives? Well, most people think ALL of the above is true, but, in fact, NONE of it is true, as is evidenced by this film. It's a pirate movie, plain and simple. A pirate movie is supposed to be unrealistic, campy fun. After all, Errol Flynn is classic, and he portrays PIRATES as romantic heroes--so, first off, if you want realism, consider the genre. Okay, now into the film. As a moviegoer, film student and someone with a brain, I can safely say that this is a fine film! To break it down The score is absolutely fantastic, and I know this will sound sacreligious to some, but on par with Star Wars. Lust listen to the CD sometime. The film is beautifully photographed, the costumes are exquisite, the sets marvelous to behold, and believe it or not it's probably the most accurate pirate movie technically speaking (no rapiers here, but brutal, no-skill cutlass brawling, pirate terminology, dress, and even the way they open rum bottles!). But, if it's so good, why did it bomb? Unfortunately, there is one thing wrong with this movie--it's own production values. With the actors surrounded by such lavish sets and special effects, you feel you ARE IN the Caribbean, and so you want to it be realistic, but, as I said, it's a pirate movie, and stays campy. Now, this uneasy feeling you have when watching it gets compounded by the slightest slip-up, and, like any movie, there are many. However, if you can just keep in mind that it's supposed to be fun, free-spirited adventure, you'll have a great time! But I must, in all honesty, point out some really bad parts of the film First, the monkey and the cabin boy are way too Disneyesque, and in fact never contribute to the plot, but rather than try to look cute, and come off as annoying (heck, the monkey in Raiders of the Lost Ark did more than most villains ever do). There are a few no brainers that subtly but powerfully make you want to dislike the movie (like when they leave the cliffs so as not to be seen and thus not let Morgan be found but leave the ropes there anyway, or when they all hide in a bush ten feet away from a guy and aren't seen). But what it all comes down to is that this was still an enjoyable film, and would have done very well if the critics didn't program people into believing it was bad to begin with. This film is proof that critics have finally succeeded in deluding peoples' minds so much that they have no opinion of their own, and simply go with the popular concensus (usually made from heresay more than experience). The pirate genre is relatively new to this generation, so people didn't know what to expect, and so, rather than giving the film a fair shake, the critics assaulted it (I guess they had to meet their quota of negativity and dirt, and Cutthroat was their scapegoat). Well, you know, Disney's Fantsia flopped when it came out to, no studio wanted Forrest Gump, and Star Wars was made almost on an accident, so, who is to say what is quality and what isn't? I say if you enjoy the movie (as I did) just forget the critics and have a good time. This film is fun!

There's another scene where Davis falls from a balcony onto a table, and the camera stays on her face the entire time.The film is not without faults, though.  Geena Davis fails to deliver her lines convincingly on several occasions.  Also, there are a handful of embarrassingly bad one-liners sprinkled throughout the film, including the line spoken by Davis right before she vanquishes the bad guy once and for all (I'll leave the details of that scene as a surprise).  Another has the villain standing in the middle of a large battle screaming, I love this!  I love this!  Such scenes are painful to watch.

Secondly, the movie would have lasted only 20 minutes if it hadn't been almost entirely slow motion. Renny Harlin is good at slow motion scenes but this movie has almost nothing in real time.

His part demands someone who can play a likable rogue while commanding the screen - Jeff Daniels might have worked in a part which would have suited the young Harrison Ford (it is very Han Solo-ish). The fact that the rather unimposing Modine was cast may be explained by the casting of the main character.The chief protagonist, the lady pirate, is played by Geena Davis. I don't much care for Geena Davis most of the time - she does nothing for me - although she was excellent in The Long Kiss Goodnight. Here, however, she does not suit the part, although she tries hard. Director Renny Harlin obviously thought she was right for the part, though - mind you, he would have had plenty of opportunity to audition her, what with being married to her at the time. This may explain why the male support was cast with an actor who does not overshadow her.With different leads, especially with some chemistry between them, this would have been a terrific film.

It has been shown repeatedly for the last 10 or more years. So maybe it was only American viewers who didn't appreciate it. Then why? I personally found it a bundle of fun, full of action, and also with a good deal of comedy, which rendered it more family entertainment. Perhaps the film is not mean and gut gripping enough to convince teenager audiences 13 years on, even though not as trite as a Disney film. More modern action films are usually supported by computer technology and run at a much faster pace. Here the stunts were real, performed by the actors themselves. All the more reason to applaud them. Why did this film get such negative criticism? Gina Davis doesn't have to be pretty, here she's playing a pirate! Matthew Modine's was an attractive he-man hero, his athletic abilities enabled him to perform this very active &#150; and demanding - role convincingly, and his character was really very humorous and versatile. The villains were convincingly bad, they got their punishment, and the happy ending made the film satisfying for younger viewers. The ships were awesome, leading to questions and discussions on how they were actually sailed or controlled. So what went wrong? I assume it hit the cinemas at a bad time, had to compete with other films or the events of the times. I have lent out my video of the film repeatedly, and never had a negative comment when it was returned, so where did all the sarcasm originate?

The movie actually managed to make Carolco Pictures go bankrupt. The company who brought us pictures like the first three Rambo movies, Total Recall, Jacob's Ladder, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, Basic Instinct, Total Recall and Stargate. It's actually in the Guinness Book of World Records as the biggest loss of money for a film company ever. In that regard it's pretty amazing that director Renny Harlin is still working in the business, on also fairly large movies.But of course Cutthroat Island is far from the worst movie of all time. It's action packed fun non-sense, that is being pulled down as a movie by its script and wrong casting choices.Of course director Renny Harlin wanted to cast his newly wed wife (and of course they are already divorced a couple of years later again) as the movie's main lead. It's not necessary that fact that a woman plays the main part in a pirate movie that makes it bad but it's the fact that Geena Davis isn't showing her greatest skills in this movie. The movie also isn't being helped by the lack of chemistry between Davis and Matthew Modine. But in his defense, he was a last minute addition to the cast, after several actors already declined the role. Frank Langella on the other hand goes deliciously over the top as the movie its ruthless main pirate villain. I guess he must have really had fun playing in this movie. To bad that none of the other actors really put any fun in their roles.There lats perhaps one problem of the movie; it's too serious all. The movie was obviously an attempt to put new life into the pirate/swashbuckler genre. After the failure of this movie, the swashbuckler genre seemed pretty death, simply because no film company dared to make another pirate movie again, until Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl, which came an unexpected huge success.The movie has a quite simplistic dark, serious color tone and atmosphere. Some more colors could had done wonders and would had made the movie a more interesting to watch. It now instead tries to be an hard entertaining action flick, with big stunts, explosions and fights but miraculously with no blood in it.At its time this movie was really big because of its stunt work. It also was one of the most expensive movies of its time with an close to an 100 million dollar budget. This big budget can be seen back on the screen, since this movie is an almost non stop action flick, with constant chases and explosions. This however of course truly goes at the expense of the story. The movie actually features one of the most awesome looking explosions in movie history, toward the end of the movie. It's one of my all time favorite movie explosions. Yes, I'm weird. It's story is way to simplistic and it's of course about a treasure hunt. The movie basically features all of the clich√©s the genre has to offer. It therefore is also predictable and perhaps even a bit tiresome to watch.Basically the biggest reason why you should ever watch this movie is the musical score by John Debney and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. Can you just imaging how bad this movie would had been without its musical score? I even dare to say that it is the very musical score which is the reason why this still is a watchable movie. It certainly is a reason for me to watch this movie once every few years. The score is totally overblown yes but it's oh so brilliant and sweeping. It's actually pretty funny how in some sequences absolutely nothing interesting or spectacular is happening but the musical score still manages to make it sound as if the most exciting and biggest thing in movie history is happening on screen.Yes it's a very well watchable movie, that perhaps is also better than the reputation given to it but it's also way too flawed to call this a great one as well.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}{"Title":"Great Film, Poorly Publicised","Date":"23 July 2007","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Given the lack of advertising it had on release (in Australia, anyway) I can probably boast to being in the minority of people who first saw this film at the cinema.

Almost nobody knew it was on, and then all they heard later was that it flopped, thus generating an assumption that it sucked.

She and the miscast Matthew Modine generate no chemistry while cavorting through a movie evidently designed to be a cliche museum of the arrgh-ye-scurvy-sea-dog genre.  It's all there--the hidden treasure, the cryptic map divided into three pieces, the chases, the swordfights, the mutinous crew, the corrupt military pirate hunters, the cliffhanging (literally), the climactic sea battle with two ships broadsiding each other--and it all goes on forever, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Cutthroat is a self-conscious attempt to make another one of The Type Of Movie Nobody Makes Anymore, as was, say, Silverado, after the Western had been declared dead and buried.  It's served up with an arch attempt at tongue-in-cheek that doesn't work.  Apparently the makers of this movie wanted to make an entry into, or an homage to, a beloved genre, but didn't trust the material, so they sent it up instead.  The result isn't so much a twinkle in the eye as a nervous twitch.  As a series of action setpieces, it works well enough.  But given the choice, rent Captain Blood instead and see the real thing.

John Debney (now famous for Passion of the Christ) delivers a loud and rousing score, which really pumps you up for the action sequences.If you look at Disneys Pirates of the Carribean closely,you will see a lot of scenes which look strangely alike to Harlin's movie.Not only because they're the same genre, but many action sequences are staged and executed in almost the same way and style as in Cutthroat.Sometimes I felt like having some sort of deja vu. While Disneys Pirate movie suffers from an overuse of digital FX,Renny Harlin's movie uses much more practical effects, which look more credible than the newer movie.

Pirates get a hold of a map, find some treasure, then duke it out. That's pretty much it. The film tries its best to make the plot roll up and down in a standard thrill-ride formula, stretching the thin story out to fill the runtime. Even though it entertains, it's not terribly deep or anything. The best that can be said is that the characters are likable (including the villain).The film looks nice, with some decent and stylish photography and editing. Acting is not too bad; I enjoyed Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, and Frank Langella in their roles. Writing is not terribly sophisticated, but it gets the job done. This production has sets, props, and costumes that look the part and fit in with the film's settings.

Miss Davis gives a remarkable performance as the pirate gal,if I wanted to continue in the sexist vein of some of the comments here I could say she has all the vitality and grace of a young Tony Curtis but of course I couldn't possibly comment on that. The Disney comic book pirate franchise that for some reason appears to have robbed so many people of their critical faculties has unaccountably succeeded beyond its makers' wildest dreams;all the more reason to wonder out loud why the infinitely better Cutthroat Island died a death.Is it because the great Miss Davis is unmistakeably a flesh and blood woman rather than the sexless Miss Knightley or the androgynous Mr Depp?

This movie grows on you despite it's unsuspected lead female character and it's very un-heralded theatrical release. The basic storyline is about finding treasure at Cutthroat Island and finding and putting together the pieces of the map that are in the hands of different parts of the Pirateer's family. The first piece of the map has to be scalped off her dead father, the 2nd is with a nicer uncle and the 3rd is with the mean other uncle. The last, of course, is the hardest to get and played by the Dracula portrayer, Frank Langella. The thing I liked about this movie is that it is not overdone and over-played but rather is a pretty straight-forward action movie. The movie was released at a time when pirate movies and especially an action movie with a female lead was not as accepted as it is now. Nonetheless, Geena Davis holds her own and the movie gets you rooting for the good guys(aka. the nicer pirates) and this is where it succeeds. This is really all that's expected from these type of movies, so bravo for all who were involved here.

So I'll do that. This movie is simply a spectacular blast of sheer action and adventure. Another way to put it would be that it is Pirates of the Caribbean, but 8 years earlier and with a female lead. Maybe it took some years until Tomb Raider came out that big budget action-fest could be seen as having a woman hero. Also pirates was a rare action movie setting. One infamous effort, Roman Polanski's film simply titled Pirates ended up being a disaster and the topic of pirates may have very well been cursed. Until the Curse of the Black Pearl, that is.Maybe cursed isn't the best way to put it, but when a spectacular and well made action movie like this goes completely unnoticed only to be repeated 8 years later with great success sounds like it just may be a curse.And spectacular this movie is with awesome action sequences that have the slow-motion grace of Peckinpah, though without his grimness. And it is all done with minimal 1995-era CGI yet packs some truly spectacular explosions that have yet to be matched using computer graphics. Also slow-motion is something vastly under-used in movies today that prefer shaky-cam and quick cutting. Renny Harlin is a master of the art yet after his 1990 hit Die Hard 2, he never quite had a series of financially rewarding films despite being able to make some of the best action sequences ever to grace the screen. It could be because, unlike Pirates of the Caribbean, Cutthroat Island doesn't have quite the same fantasy light-hearted tone. It is more akin to Indiana Jones. Meaning there is blood and general badassness throughout. Pirates were after all ruthless people and this film shows this much more than PotC yet remains fun throughout.And the climatic battle is a knock-out scene that tops anything and everything in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. --- 9/10BsCDb Classification PG --- violence "},{"Title":"THE TREASURE OF A Spanish GOLDSHIP","Date":"4 June 2004","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  CUTTHROAT ISLAND is a memorable film. GEENA DAVIS is great as the pirate Morgan Adams. The theme music for the movie is very distinctive and enjoyable. Renny Harlin is a better Director than people give him credit for. I liked how the movie hints that there will be a sequel set near MADAGASCAR. With the end of the relationship between Geena Davis and Renny Harlin I don't think that the sequel will get made. Then again with the success of Pirates of the Caribbean maybe we will see another pirate movie soon. When Cutthroat Island came out Regis Philbin on Live with Regis and Cathy Lee said Its been a long time since there was a good pirate movie out.In the movie the character of Morgan Adams says The treasure of a Spanish Goldship. I think that there really are Alien Goldships on the Ocean floor. Made out of gold because they are easy to weld. The ships probably look like giant diving bells. In the series STARGATE SG-1 the characters talk about the Gou'ld which sounds a lot like gold. I think that human submarines in the Caribbean encountered the Goldships and they are shared between the British and the Americans. I think that the Goldships are close to the Bahamas. If there are Aliens I wonder what aspect ratio they use for their televisions. Probably a 21 aspect ratio. I enjoy watching CUTTHROAT ISLAND on DVD in Widescreen by the way. Mathew Modine does a fine job of acting as Willy Shaw. The passion between Davis and Modine is believable. I found the hiding place of the treasure of the Spanish goldship to be quite witty. I would highly recommend both Cutthroat Island and Pirates of the Caribbean for your viewing pleasure.

One way or another, they had to make this movie. The speaker is Geena Davis --- Captain Morgan Adams herself --- and the 'they' to which she's referring is Carolco Pictures, they of T2, Rambo II and III, Basic Instinct and 20 other titles. One way or another, Geena explains in the Sunday New York Times article Debacle on the High Seas, which was published some two years ago, this was their last movie. That movie, of course, is 1995's Cutthroat Island --- which, as that article reveals, proved to be Hollywood's biggest $100 million flop. But if you love movies about swashbucklin' Pirates (as I do!), here's a film that stands out as a virtual Pirate's paradise! Directed by Geena's husband at the time, Renny Harlin, CTI is a truly unique Pirate adventure. Starting things off in Jamaica during the 1660's, the story begins with the feisty Morgan rescuing her father (Harris Yulin) from the machinations of the nasty Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), only to see Papa Adams die in her arms. Before he does, he reveals the secret to Cutthroat Island's great treasure. That secret has its origins in a map which has been divided into three parts --- the first third of which has been somehow tattooed on his head. The second third is in the hands of Morgan's Uncle Mordecai; Dawg himself seeks to grab the last third before Morgan does, and basically the tale follows the two Pirates and their crews on a fast-paced, occasionally ribald, but wildly exciting quest to see which of them can put it all together first. Problem is, even with all three of its components put together, the map is mostly written in Latin; and it's up to Morgan Adams and her crew, aided by the young con man-turned-wouldbe physician Dr. William Shaw (Matthew Modine), to translate the text, follow the map's instructions, abscond with the Cutthroat treasure and sail for home. Now, why the critics had it in for this film when it was first released is beyond me. I strongly suspect that there is a so-called politically-correct generation that is completely unprepared for movies about Pirates. That is why, I guess, there are folks like myself who long for the days when you could watch a film featuring Pirates --- and not be afraid to tell the world about it. That was my hope some 15 years ago when I saw Roman Polanski's Pirates (rest in peace, beloved Captain Red!); clearly when Cutthroat was first released, it was my hope as well. You cannot know how devastated I was when, through the film's initial U.S. boxoffice flop, those hopes were summarily dashed. Yet, as Founder and Chairman of Electric Pirates Entertainment, I have never failed to lose hope that Hollywood will one day get with the program and make another Pirate movie in this just-now-born 21st Century. As I discovered for myself some 72 hours ago, what makes Cutthroat Island so magical is that it features the one thing I never thought I'd see in my recent life as a Pirate movie lover namely, an all-Pirate happy ending! Believe me, I wept for joy as Morgan and Dr. Shaw kissed to the rousing cheers of their shipmates as the Morning Star sailed off to adventures new, fully loaded with the treasure of Cutthroat Island! Know this, you Hollywood yesmen, yuppies and other losers we who love Pirate movies will continue to get on your case until such time as you give us what we want --- by which I mean, the Cutthroat Island sequel! Got it? And just in case you didn't get the message, there's a little magazine called No Quarter Given --- which, like Cutthroat Island itself, is a Pirate's paradise --- that would very readily back me up.

Had the lead been male it might have been a different story in terms of the film's success at the Box Office. Shame, because it is fast paced and the action scenes are great! Geena Davis is actually very good with her wild hair and mucky tan - she looks and sounds just like a pirate captain should, male or female. Matthew Modine is suitably funny, sly and cute as a foil to Davis's rough and readiness. I also like the fact that when it comes down to the last big fight it's Davis who is left to face the villain alone to give him his comeuppance and not her male pirate posse. I say let people watch this film and judge for themselves, because if you like pirate movies you won't be disappointed!

Being a great fan of any good pirate story, I just had to re-watch it as an adult.What I found was a movie almost as good as I remember it. As an adult, I would of course smirk a bit at plot holes and some of the cheesy choreography (by which I mean such things as a bunch of Carolinians standing still in the middle of a battle, almost 'waiting' for the coming bomb to go of, or the 'good guys' appearing out of nowhere right behind the said Carolinians). But never mind that! Let's focus on the good things instead.It starts in the middle of a scene in which we are introduced to two of the main characters, the protagonist and the antagonist. The incident makes us understand that the protagonist (the pirate captain) is a well known pirate with a reputation, and the antagonist (a highly reputable politician) has got a taste for pirate flesh (on several levels, I might add). We quickly get into the story, and along the story goes on, we are introduced to more and more details about the persons and what has happened before the movie. A plus is that it's not like thrown in your face at the end. Another mark on the good side is all the playing around with details typical for the pirate genre (by which I mean both books and movies, of course). But it never really gets clich√©! Sometimes the movie is on the edge to get so, but never quite takes that final step over. We got a treasure island (Cutthroat Island), a bunch of hilarious/funny/goofy/kick ass pirates fighting each other and the 1600s government, some clever lines, a few bottles of rum and the Caribbean landscape. What else can you ask for in a pirate movie? The stunts, effects, acting and editing are never less than so-so, sometimes really good. Bare in mind that it was made almost twenty years ago, and the conditions as we have today wasn't really the same (which makes it easier for me to watch ... I know films from today that are far worse made). On the hole if you would like to watch a good ol' pirate movie, with all the necessary ingredients, this is the one for you. I you are not a fan of pirate movies, but would like to change your mind, this is definitely the one for you!

You're telling me this movie lost something like 100 million?? Ouch! Do Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer make that much of a difference? Apparently so. Anyway, though night quite as enjoyable as the most recent POTC romps, Cutthroat Island is a lot of fun. And you can even see some touches that POTC may have borrowed from this film. Such as the cute little monkey for reaction shots. But this is a straight up swashbuckler and does not have elements of the supernatural or CGI beasties.Geena Davis plays Morgan Adams, a female pirate captain who assumes command of a ship after its former captain (her father) dies early on. In order to hold her crew together, she decides to seek a vast fortune in Spanish gold found on you guessed it... Cutthroat Island. But of course finding this treasure will not be easy. Davis has only one of three pieces of the map (taken from the scalp of her dead father no less!) and the other two belong to her uncles who are deadly pirates in their own right. And the map is apparently written in Latin which nobody on her crew can decipher. So she will also need the strapping scoundrel William Shaw (Matthew Modine) to assist her. It is apparently hard to find people who can read a few words of Latin in the 17th century Caribbean! And of course the corrupt local English lord of record wants his share of the loot and the heroine dangling from the gallows at Port Royal. Prepare for some swashbuckling! This film is truly exciting, and full of dangerous stunts often performed by the real actors themselves. I'd say the combat scenes here are a touch better than those of POTC. The script has some humor, but nowhere near the funny dialog of POTC. Davis seems badly miscast at first, but she grows on you. Its easy to see why Michael Douglas pulled out of this project, assuming he was up for Modine's role. He almost seems like an afterthought by the time this movie is over, and Davis seems to get all the fun things to do. It really is a vehicle of hers, but unfortunately it got driven off a cliff. Davis and director husband Renny Harlin tried it again the following year with Long Kiss Goodnight, but that was also a financial disappointment. Davis really hasn't done all that much since this movie. Frank Langella is terrific as the baddest pirate of them all Dawg Brown. Look out for Rex Linn from CSI Miami who plays a pirate with weird tattoos all over his face. If you are in any way interested in Pirate movies or lore, give this fine film a chance! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

The special FX are great, there are plenty of pirate stereotypes for everyone (like the tattooed boatswain Mr. Glasspoole, the helpful Caribbean pirate, the fresh-faced pirate apprentice, etc.) Uncle Dog steals the show, and the sets/scenery in Malta and Thailand are breathtakingly gorgeous.
