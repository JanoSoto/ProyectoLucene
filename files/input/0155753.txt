The father makes Jake a deal he can't refuse  get home by 6 p. m. Christmas Eve, and he can have the Porsche they rebuilt together.  One problem  Jake helps some athletes cheat on a final exam, but his plan is sabotaged, and 'Eddie and the boys' leave him in the desert wearing a Santa suit, with nothing but a note they signed. Eddie sets out to take Jake's girlfriend home.  Jake calls her but there is a problem with her answering machine.  Jake calls home for help but he has lied and schemed too many times before.  It is his ability to lie that gets him on the road making progress toward his goal, but also into new jams.  He sees Eddie several times (what are the chances?) but his girlfriend doesn't see him until the fourth time, and that doesn't turn out well.  Of course, Eddie and Jake's girlfriend don't get along too well in their travels east. It's a fun film if not great.  Jake helps several people, including himself, learn the true meaning of Christmas.  Lots of great scenery in the first half of the movie, and a lot of the music is good,  with styles including jazz and bluegrass.  And the situations Jake gets himself into are quite funny.  Have you ever seen a 5K race where all the entrants are dressed like Santa?  It's a family film with a little off-color humor (I saw the edited version, so no bad language to speak of).

First of all, it's star Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Remember when he used to be a cute kid who was good in everything he did? But fate played a horrible joke on him He grew up. He got bigger, he is no longer cute, and worst of all, he's lost his trademark voice!! It's gotten deeper and more wise allecky. He was cute when he was young, but now he grew up into an UNFUNNY, unloveable being. He can sort of relate to Macaulay Culkin. Only difference Jonathan's Dad isn't crazy! (That's not for sure because I don't know the man).            About this film. Thomas plays Jake, a smartass college student who always wheels and deals and get's into trouble. Now Jonathan was 17 when he made this movie, so it's very unbelieveable that he could be a college student. He has a ditzy girlfriend, who in my opinion, is not that hot! But Jake is crazy about her. But one day he get's into trouble and they glue a Santa suit to him???And leave him in the desert for dead. Meanwhile he had made a deal with his parents that if he's home by Christmas, Dad will give him the car he and Jake used to work on. So Jake breaks his back trying to get home to New York. Always running into trouble with UNFUNNY results!!! What is more, Jake's girlfriend is riding with an idiot named Eddie. I hate those two.         (NOW THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE A SPOILER OR TOO, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE. NOW IT MAY SPOIL IT FOR YOU, BUT HEY, NOBODY'S FORCING YOU TO READ THIS)        Now after all the hassle, Jake returns home and decides he doesn't want the car. Whoever wrote this movie deserves to be kicked in the face! Just like the people who acted in it!Jonathan Taylor must have a bad agent! That creep wouldn't even do the final episode of Home Improvement!!! Like many other actors, Jonathan Taylor Thomas is washed up! I guess Disney figured if they did a Christmas movie with Tim Allen, why not do one with Jonathan? Only difference Tim Allen was actually good in his Xmas movie. What JTT should do is give up acting all together and actually do something with his life. He could write and direct movies! He could become a doctor, or something, help this screwy world. Acting is not a good perfession to go into. Because let's face it, movies and TV are not exactly keeping us alive.          In conclusion, don't see this film! It's predictable right down to the last second! So go watch another Xmas movie, like The Grinch! Jonathan Taylor Thomas, persue a better career! Thank you. And Happy Holidays! -----------  "},{"Title":"Just relax and enjoy it a little...","Date":"16 July 1999","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  OK.

The worst theatrical movie I have ever watched is currently Cruel Intentions, but today I watched I'll Be Home for Christmas, expecting a funny holiday movie, but instead I got cinematic trash that gave Cruel Intentions a run for the money as worst theatrically released movie ever. Every scene, every joke, every situation, and every main character is loathesome. The entire movie is one big insult to the intelligence. Surely someone involved with this project should have realized what a tragic mess they were making and said something to put a stop to it. But alas it was not to be. *Minor spoilers herein* Instead we are treated with an insufferable comedy centered on a totally obnoxious and arrogant rich kid. I wasn't sympathetic to him at all and I didn't buy his transformation for a moment. Nor did I find any of his snafus funny. Every single mishap was an unfunny bomb. I mean, are we supposed to laugh when Thomas consistently lied or stole to get his way? What's so awful about it (aside form the moral standpoint) is that everyone bought his lies. Only an idiot would believe what he said. What about when he gave away stolen appliances to children in a hospital? Worst moment of all (which had me screaming at the television for the madness to stop) involved the bus-liver gag. Thomas uses a sandwich, crayons, and a cooler to make it look like a liver needed to be delivered in a nearby town. But they didn't even bother to show how Thomas obtained these items from the people in the neighboring seats, or why the guy with the cooler didn't realize the liver was in HIS cooler! Anyway, this is hands down the worst Christmas movie I have ever watched. I would love to pick this dog apart, but I seem to get hate mail whenever I trash a so-called family movie, so I'll just leave you with the short warning to avoid this mess at all costs.

The story is generic, falling into the typical wacky scenarios road trip movie category. The story is also incredible mean spirited to the main character, Jake. However, I feel no sympathy for him since he is one of the worst examples of a self centered jerk ever put into a Disney movie. He not only mistreats his girlfriend, Allie, and family, but also acts like everyone he meets is beneath him and only there to service him. However, Eddie, the villain, makes Jake look like a saint. Eddie is one of cinema's biggest tools, hitting on Allie right in front of Jake and treating Allie like she's nothing more than a hot body. At least Jake and Allie had common interests and occasional moments of chemistry, so he seems like the better boyfriend, which seems impossible. Also, writers fail when they need to write a character whose sole purpose is to make the main character look better. Also, the ending is completely out of character for Jake, comes out of nowhere, and feels incredibly insulting. This might very well be the worst live action movie Disney ever associated themselves with, truly deserving to be a terribly reviewed box office bomb.

Thomas, still his gravelie voiced, smart-alecky, Home Improvement-type self,  just doesn't work with the material given to him. He's playing a smug pretty-boy with all the connections and all the answers, and he comes off more snotty than charming. Mainly because his one-liners just aren't funny. His smugness is un-amusing. There's no biting intelligent sarcasm, nor razor sharp wit or funny facial expressions. He's more like a spoiled 16-year old trying to be funny in front of dad's camcorder. Director Arlene Sanford, who's past efforts behind the camera have consisted mainly of tv sitcoms and hour-long dramas such as Ally McBeal and Caroline In The City, does manage to pull off a few heart-warming holiday moments (aided greatly by composer John Debney's trademark gooey scoring), and even manages to make Jennifer Biel of 7th Heaven fame interesting, mostly when she's in scenes without J.T.T. Kudos also to Sanford for casting Gary Cole in her film; even though his role is limited and largely unimportant, he's a talented actor who deserves more exposure than he gets. If it's Christmas Eve and you're in the mood to be pumped up for the holiday and sick of Its A Wonderful Life, than I'll Be Home For Christmas is for you.

With the exception of the Lion King, every film Thomas would star in did poorly at the box office. This film was no exception. Producers have made the same mistake with stars like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Giovanni Ribisi just to name a few. Its amazing it can take up the 3 duds to show an actor has no star power. I might be wrong but I don't think Thomas has had a starring role since this film. After this dismal failure, filmmakers must have since the light a realized Thomas was such an overrated child actor that had grown up.

This movie is a great Christmas movie, why's everybody gotta bag on a good ol standard xmas flick just because there are no major stars, songs or special effects. Seriously. Get over yourselves. Johnathan is a great lead, he's effective emotionally and his cookie cutter transformation is warm and real. Honestly, I enjoyed the way the film made me feel. Without having to go through trashy sleaze to get to the nice ending. There aren't many quality Christmas films being made anymore. The last truly wonderful Christmas movie I saw in Theaters was The Preachers Wife. Denzel, Whitney, and tons of music. I'll Be Home, although not on the same scale, still shows plenty of heart.

It took place during the last Christmas of World War II, and was about a family whose son was in the Army, and they invited a couple of soldiers stationed nearby to spend the holidays with them. I think one of the daughters and one of the soldiers fell in love during the holiday. I can't find any information about it, and I loved the movie. Can't even tell you who was in it. The only information I can find is the above movie, with JTT, and it's not the one I would like to see. Does anyone have any idea where I can find out anything about it, and if it's available for viewing or purchasing? It was so poignant and nostalgic. It remains one of my favorite memories of the era of my childhood.

What could have been a charming story instead became another platform for some of Disney's tired and lingering experiments. Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays the part of a self centered college age student who fixates on his own desires and gives the college crowd as a whole the black eye. While there are some who would believe that all college students are selfish and uncaring the exact opposite holds true. Thomas always selects his roles carefully and opted to play the part of his alter ego in this film. His acting ability remains the same. You can only get so far on cuteness, now that it's gone, what's left?Thomas and the other cast members did not do the film justice and the use of crassness, profanity unneeded for the most part, and cheap attempts at humor have left this movie in the don't see category of most reputable video stores.I would not recommend seeing this movie at all during the holidays but would relegate it to particular showings in the appalachian region of the states. Low brow at its best.

The most hilarious one, to me, was when he encountered Eddie (Adam LaVorgna) in his hotel room. This was because he had Jake's girlfriend (Jessica Biel) with him. Please, don't tell me my sense of enjoyment is twisted. In addition, the bus driver was a complete jerk. Also, from the looks of it, the Porsche that was at stake was absolutely vintage. The reason I said that is because it was a 1957 model. In conclusion, if you like Jonathan Taylor Thomas or Christmas movies, this is one you'll definitely want to see.

I mean, it's not horrible, but it isn't a great film, and is just barely decent. And of course, they threw in foul language right at the end so families can't enjoy it. Figures... Disney needs to learn that one swear word isn't going to get teenagers running off to see their films, and won't be holding families interested either.

Bad move.The plot in and of itself might have had a chance of working.  It'sobviously been done before.  However, the events along the waythis time seem not only too contrived even for a movie.  Not onlythat, it manages to play to stereotypes of 'The Great Flyover' alongthe way.  I am speaking mostly of the largest Bavarian village inIowa,  an attempted amalgamation of some of Iowa's ethnicheritage and attractions like the Amana Colonies.  It seemed lessof a reflection of history than an attempt to make fun of the rubes inthe middle of nowhere (as various locations were referred to in themovie).The whole act to get JTT to this community in the first place was noless ludicrous.  Who will be carrying a donor liver in a bus?  Andwould Edelbruck (or however they spelled it) have a hospital to dosuch transplants?In addition, someone needs to take geography lessons.  How didthey err? Let me count the ways -Interstate 15 was marked East with a non-interstate marker _ona two-lane road_. -The Colorado deputy said they were doing 79 in a 65 althoughColorado in 1997/98 had already raised the interstate speed limitpast 65. -Why in the world would anyone going to New York from Iowa gothrough _Wisconsin_?? -There were quite a few hills in the scenery on the trip from Iowa toWisconsin, but that is (slightly) realistic.  However, the sceneryalso shows them using two-lane roads a lot, which would be veryunlikely if you're trying to get to New York as fast as possible.  (Butif you're going to NY through Wisconsin you're not trying.)Jennifer Biel was about the only redeeming factor in the movie, butI say about because her conflict between the two boys didn'tseem like a conflict at all.  Had she slugged him after he kissedher, then that's something.  But she was apparently beginning tolike Eddie, who didn't do anything along the trip to merit anychange in her opinion of him from when they started out.But all films must come to an end, and so JTT comes back, getsthe girl back, and as the cliche goes, learns the true meaning ofChristmas.  Mm-hm.  This, after he started the misadventure inthe first place after promising to help athletes cheat on a test.Six minus one for insulting Iowa gives it 5/10, and that's becauseI'm in the Christmas spirit of giving.

The acting isn't fabulous, with Eddy and Norman (I think that was his name) being the only likeable character. And I think JTT lost all credibilty during this movie. On 'Home Improvement' he was always kind of clean, with only small problems. Now, here he is a scam artist, cussing, college student.The music was also pretty bad as well. IMO, this isn't a great film, but if you have a few hours to kill...might as well. You will laugh a little. "}]
