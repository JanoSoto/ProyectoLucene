His Tales of the South Pacific became a major blockbuster Broadway hit for Rodgers&Hammerstein. South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another Michener success, Sayonara.It was only a decade before that American films during World War II did not portray the Japanese kindly. I'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the Pacific war to change attitudes overnight. That and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance.Sayonara is a relevant film today. The military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally. In America at the time Sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states. Today gays in the military is a big issue. Someone may one day do a Sayonara like film on that issue.Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. South Pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. With a sure hand, Logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story.Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith some of the occidental players do a fine job. But the picture is stolen by the orientals here. Miko Taka hits the mark beautifully as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two that one both Supporting players Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki.Buttons is your everyman enlisted man Air Force member. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up. They presume to KNOW what's best for Buttons and Umeki. Buttons was a TV comedian and a fair talent, but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career.And Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first one given to an oriental. It got a great deal of attention because at the time of the Academy Awards, Miyoshi was starring on Broadway in Flower Drum Song. I was privileged to see it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I ever saw. I still carry the memory of it.That Oscar symbolized something else too. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw in Sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture.Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, a Kabuki Theatre actor. If Sayonara were done today, Logan would never get away with it. But Montalban is fine. Good location photography and a grand story. This film should be revived more often it has a great moral.

I was pleasantly surprised by how frank the film is in its portrayal of institutionalized racism and its effects on the rank-and-file soldiers and the buracracy that controls their lives. Red Buttons and the woman who played his wife both won Oscars for  their roles, and deservedly so. They are not the main characters of the film, but they embody the film's message and its spirit as well, and are the most naturally written characters in the movie. Red Buttons's display of rage when his wife attempts to disguise her ethnicity is amazingly genuine and moving. Yes, the women are portrayed in a derogatory fashion, as a previous reviewer has observed. But this was 1957, after all, and on top of that the film takes place in a military setting. Add to that the fact that Japan at that time was at least as bad as the West in its treatment of women and it's hardly a surprise that the gender dynamic is what it is. The most ironic thing, I found, was the fact that although Hollywood was comfortable casting Asian women in the film, the one speaking role by a Japanese male character (who has a subtly romantic role in relation to an American woman) was given to Ricardo Monalban. It was okay to have miscegenation portrayed with some frankness, as long as it involved Japanese women, not Japanese men.

'Sayonara' is a superb film in every category.Brando's odd (to say the least) 'southern' accent proves to be abrilliant choice in defining his character's contrasting presence inthe Japanese scene, an approach he would employ later in hisamazing, bizarre interpretation of Fletcher Christian.  Whatever onethinks of Brando's choices in tackling a role, he was never dull,and watching him experiment is a viewer's treat. And MiyoshiUmeki what a discovery! The portrayal of those in Japan who arejust living their lives is done with sensitivity and humanity.Just as important as the stars' performance and the story itself, isFranz Waxman's music. It cannot be praised too highly, and is aperfect example of a meticulously crafted score mature, totallysincere, and without one trace of cynicism or misdirection.  Filmmusic like this is safe from being taken for granted. Waxman'stheme for the Red Buttons/Miyoshi Umeki relationship is amongthe most poignant and haunting even written for the screen. Itsvariations range from wistful to heartbreaking.None other than Irving Berlin supplied the title song (he gets asmuch screen credit as Waxman!).

When this movie was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. The Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Civil Rights was in it's infancy. Could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary, a Southern man in love with a woman of another race? The same way MASH was a subtle criticism of the Viet Nam war? Any thoughts?Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki appearing cold. Anyone who has been in Japan would understand. The Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men meeting single women. Americans in Japan were totally foreign to this culture, and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies. One trait of the Japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many American servicemen took as a sign that their advances were welcomed. Also remember that at the time represented in the movie, Japan had just been defeated, and the occupying forces were treated with reluctant acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been. Watching her interaction with the American actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country. I was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who, after I convinced them I was not the typical American male, taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country.

I was amazed to learn that Brando was nominated for an Oscar for this film, because for the life of me I can't see what a woman would see in his character, especially a Japanese woman.  (Yes, I'm female.) Brando kind of mumbles through the whole thing, and his character doesn't have any kind of intelligence or kindness.I'm sure this movie was a big deal in 1957.  It actually does a reasonably good job of bringing up issues with interracial marriages, which is still a hot topic in large portions of the world.  However, a movie that I think addresses the topic in a more interesting and timeless fashion is The Bitter Tea of General Yen, starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra.  General Yen impressed me a great deal, whereas Sayonara did not.The happy surprise in this film was Red Buttons' performance.  My only previous exposure to Red Buttons was in things like Dean Martin roasts when I was a kid.  I didn't understand why he was famous.  Buttons earned/won an Oscar for his sympathetic portrayal of a  open-minded man who marries a Japanese woman and willingly learns Japanese culture because of his love.

Clearly by the Sex in the City standards, Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However, when judged from the prospective of 1925 America, he was fantastic. Likewise Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair, American manifest destiny arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step to such films as Gentleman's Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget.However, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific. Although, some attack Brando's accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film.Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. Her speech when she first meets and speaks with Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema. The dialog between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film's end is equally good. Of course, it doesn't have the mouth-sucking, spit-swapping and worse, that exemplifies love in today's movies, but that makes it all the better. It portrays true love and passion, and not just heat.

Two American service men finds old world Japanese women more attractive than women from their own country. Major Gruver (Marlon Brando) stationed in Itami Japan is asked by his superior to convince his crew chief Airmen Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) to break off engagement with Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki) - a Japanese girl. Interracial marriage was eschewed at the time, and somewhat thought to be out of form for Americans to marry an Asian, especially the Japanese who were their enemies in the recent war. Major Gruver tries to convince Joe that fine real American woman is what's really worth marrying until he is introduced to Hanaogi (Miiko Taka) by Joe and Katsumi.This movie was ground breaking in so many ways when it was released. Usage of James Michener's story who was known to write many international themed movies was a fresh move for Hollywood, and it was one of the first movie not to stereotype Asians as Charlie Chan type characters. It was also one of the first movie to cast Japanese as Japanese in their roles, not Americans with an Asian make up ( well not completely as Ricardo Montalban's character shows, and Hanaogi was supposed to be played by Audrey Hepburn until she declined the part ). In any case, the main characters were played by Brando and a new comer who was working as a travel agent in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles at the time, Miiko Taka. She was one of the first Asian woman to portray Asians in their native role. Likes of her showed that Asians can portray themselves much better than an American actors posing as Asians. She also showed that Asian beauty can be on equal footings with their counterparts, which began the paradigm shift to cast Asians in their native role in Hollywood movies.Marlon Brando may have been a rebel, but had no nonsense attitude about things. He was sensible in many ways about life which was taken to be unconventional at the time, but became more of a norm in society in subsequent years. Attitude of Major Gruver somewhat reflects his no nonsense ways he had with society, and he was the perfect actor to play the part. Miiko Taka had an outstanding regal presence in this movie. She was no second fiddle to anybody, and was perfect for her role as well.The movie has style, and beauty all its own. Situations between the casts were very romantic. The movie showed that it's cool to date an Asian woman, which today no one even thinks twice about. A great movie in its production and style, and stands as a classic all on its own.

Like some other comments regarding this film, I feel that it could have depicted areas of Japanese life more in-line with Michener's book (and more realistically). I also found both Brando's and Garner's characters tiresome, and their acting annoying and sophomoric. Brando's officer would (and should) never have fraternized with Buttons' airman to the extent shown, and his hanging-around the bridge where Hana-Ogi and the others made their way to and from the theater was silly, even inane, and displayed a demeanor more appropriate to a fraternity nerd in, say, Animal House. (Marlon and Jim Garner hanging around this area, mooning and giggling bordered on the ludicrous. Two handsome, decorated military officers, they seemed sillier than the nerds peeking into the girls' shower room in Porky's. But at least the latter were doing what high school boys might be expected to do, and they were less silly than Marlon and Jim.) Ricardo Montalban's performance could charitably be described as wooden. It brought to mind the Yul Brynner character in Westworld, but then that role WAS a robot. The general who was initially to become Brando's father-in-law, displayed characteristics which, in the real world, would have found him passed-over for promotion even to a major.The movie's best attributes are the music and locale. Finally, despite the acclaim heaped on Brando from his earlier roles onward, I for one, have found his accents and accompanying affectations both off-putting and annoying in this film; as the German officer in The Young Lions; in his stilted, over-the top delivery as Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire, and as the pug in On the Waterfront.

It's well acted for the most part and despite having some cringe worthy moments, holds up pretty well.And that's because of Marlon Brando. His absolutely oozing charisma, energy and cool. His performance carries the terrible script and the fairly corny dialog. The rest of the cast were fine, I guess. I don't understand why they gave Oscar nods to Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. They gave fine performances but nothing that impressive. Well, it might have been a because of the racial politics of the time. Miiko Taka was fairly bland but that's because she had no real character to play with or other characters to act against. It's sad because she has talent and can act. And then there is Ricardo Khan Montalban in yellow-face. Yeah, I mentioned that it was a product of it's time. And he also is very underused and pretty much does nothing.And that leads to my main problem with Sayonara. It's badly written and delves into all clichés you can find in romantic stories about prejudice. I'm not going to bash it for the obvious sexism of the 1950's Hollywood, in which all women needs a man or their lives are meaningless. No, I'm going to bash it for abandoning all the character development for female characters, especially Japanese ones. Brando's love interest Hana-Ogi has no character to speak off besides the fact she hates Americans for killing her family. Which she forgets immediately after meeting with the MAN. She has no conflict because we don't see her life and what she goes through. And so Miiko Taka's performance suffers because she has nothing to do except look pretty and mysterious, while Marlon Brando gets to do stuff. It's hard to put on a good performance when the only character you interact in the story for more than 1 minute is Marlon Brando. And that's whole problem with the script in general. Everything is underwritten and subplots are left unresolved, while the main romance and characters, aside from Marlon Brando, are underwritten.While these problems are very important, they don't really distract me that much from enjoying Sayonara. I like Marlon Brando when he gives a damn about the films he is starring in. And gives one really good performance. And to be fair, I'm a big sucker for those silly white man meets Asian woman stories. They are a big guilty pleasure for me and I won't deny that enjoy Americas/British/French filmmakers embarrass themselves making these films. 9 times out 10 they suck, however there are some exceptions to it but most of the times you get something like this.Sayonara is a hard film to recommend to today's audience. The portrayal of Japanese people and the yellow-face might throw some people off and the overall dated feel might even detract more people. But if you like some corny story about the white man falling for Asian girl then you might get something out of it. It's worth seeing for Marlon Brando's performance alone.

Sayonara won 7 Oscars, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Leading Actor (Brando), Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. The Bridge on the River Kwai also won 7 Oscars, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Leading Actor (Alec Guiness). But Bridge rates higher on this site and is generally considered a film classic.Sayonara was adapted from a James Michener novel. He had personal reasons for writing about Japanese-American relations, being married to a Japanese woman. The film was directed by Joshua Logan who, at this point in his directing career, was a proved commodity. His next film would be Michener's South Pacific. Brando's last film, prior to Sayonara was Teahouse of the August Moon.It is easy to see that Hollywood was dealing with Japanese-American relations in plenty of its films. And racism was a significant factor in the story.The main theme of Sayonara is racism. It considers both sides of the equation--the prejudice against Americans by some Japanese (especially as personified by the character Hana-Ogi, who hates Americans because they bombed her family) and the prejudice of Americans toward the Japanese (especially as portrayed by Brando as Major Gruver, a career military pilot). Both characters undergo transformation in their viewpoints when exposed to members of the other race.The film eventually turns into a love story about two couples who wish to bridge the cultural gap. It is a tender, sensitive story with important things to say.The cast is great. I won't single out anyone, because they all are worthy of acclaim.This film deserves to be seen due to its courageous point of view and its place in film history as a milestone on the road to racial tolerance.Special note should be given to the sensitive way Japanese culture is depicted, with patient portrayals of Kabuki and the meditation that is the Japanese tea ceremony.

It tells the story of an American Air Force flier that was an fighter pilot during the Korean War.The screenplay was adapted by Paul Osborn from the novel by James Michener.It was directed by Joshua Logan.The movie takes its own sweet time to unfold; in so doing, it permits us to make intimate acquaintance with its characters, so as to better understand their multi-textured motivations. The film is set in Japan during the Korean War. Lloyd Ace Gruver, a major and the son of a U.S. Army general, is stationed at Itami Air Force Base near Kobe, Japan. He falls in love with a Japanese entertainer who is a performer for a Takarazuka-like theater company, whom he meets through his enlisted crew chief, Airman Kelly.Kelly is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi, in spite of the disapproval of the United States military, which will not recognize the marriage. The Air Force, including Gruver, is against the marriage. Gruver and Kelly have an argument during which Gruver uses a racial slur to describe Kelly's fiancée. Gruver eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Kelly's best man at the wedding.Kelly suffers further prejudice at the hands of a particularly nasty colonel, pulling extra duty and all the less-attractive assignments. When he and many others who are married to Japanese are ordered back to the States, Kelly realizes he will not be able to take his wife, who is now pregnant.Finding no other way to be together, Kelly and Katsumi commit double suicide. This strengthens Major Gruver's resolve to marry his own Japanese lover. When asked by a Stars and Stripes reporter what will he say to both the big brass as well as to the Japanese, neither of which will be particularly happy, Major Gruver says, Tell 'em we said 'Sayonara.'This movie deals with racism and prejudice in the U.S. Military.Also,the message picture about interracial marriage is made more enjoyable by the then novelty of locations shooting in Japan.Also,the likable performances from Marlon Brando, Red Buttons, and rest of the cast elevated this film. In other words,there is nothing but top-notch acting in this film. Overall,this movie touches a controversial topic in its year of release in 1950's.

He claims he's not racist but he tries hard to talk admiring soldier Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) out of marrying a Japanese girl which is against regulations. Nevertheless he's a witness to his wedding. While bringing his girlfriend Eileen Webster and her family General Webster to the club, Captain Bailey (James Garner) tries to bring a famous Japanese performer in but is rejected by the guard and General Webster. He and Eileen go to see Kabuki and meets performer Nakamura (Ricardo Montalban). They have a blow out when Eileen wants to advance their relationship. Being a witness to the inter-racial marriage causes more friction between Gruver and General Webster. He falls for Hana-Ogi who is the star performer and his previous prejudices go out the window. In addition to official regulation, they face social isolation from both sides.This is a weak romance wrapped in a message movie. While I admire the message, the romance has a great deal of problem. First Brando has to dump the white movie pinup girl. I think it's a way to show that he's choosing a Japanese girl over a white girl to break the old mold. The first problem is that the audience isn't introduced to Hana-Ogi until after 45 minutes and she doesn't have much to do. It's very late for the romantic lead. The second problem is that she doesn't have chemistry with Brando or at least less chemistry than with Eileen. They don't really interact enough to create the chemistry. The third is that the message becomes larger than the romance and it is made to serve it. The movie may have maintained a better structure if Eileen was written out and General Webster was just Gruver's disapproving father.

For the first few days on the set, I tried to act. But then I made an experiment. In this scene, I tried to do everything wrong I could think of. Grimaced and rolled my eyes, put in all kind of gestures and expressions that had no relation to the part I'm supposed to be playing. What did Logan say? He just said, 'It's wonderful. Print it!'

The novel follows two Americans who romance Japanese women, one with tragic results. The film gives a nice colorful richness to life in Kabuki theatre, post-war Japan and the USAF. Production design and costuming are first rate and lend the appropriate note of exoticness to the culture clash plot line. It is interesting that the script balances American bigotry toward the Japanese off against Japanese attitudes toward Americans. Miiko Taka lacks some credibility in the role of a famous entertainer - she neither dances nor sings particularly well - who in the book is almost a national treasure, leading to a scandal when she gets involved with an Air Force officer, Brando, who is very good here in a rare straight romantic role.

Oscar nominated for Best Leading Actor, Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Gruver, a Korean War flying ace reassigned to Japan, who staunchly supports the military's opposition to marriages between American troops and Japanese women and tries without any success to talk his friend Joe Kelly out of getting married.

On leave, he discovers his Madame Butterfly, falls in love. The lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations.This film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist, conservative standards, dominant at the time it was made in 1957. Sayonara will make you laugh and cry. Beware though, sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there, although, Irving Berlin's title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again.

In this one Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Ace Gruver, a General's son who's been raised a certain way, being transfered from Korea to Japan where his girlfriend Eileen Webster (Patricia Owens) conveniently happens to be. Before leaving, he tries to persuade one of his men, a Joe Kelly (Red Buttons), out of marrying Japanese woman Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki) since that's a violation of military fraternization laws. With the romance of him and Eileen on the outs, however, Ace not only becomes the best man at Joe and Katsumi's wedding, he falls for an Asian himself after he and Captain Mike Bailey (James Garner) go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer Hana-ogi (Miiko Taka) on stage. Bailey himself is dating one of the dancers, Fumiko-San (Reiko Kuba). Eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the Kabuki performers, Nakamura (Ricardo Montalban). I'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning American-Asian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end. Even seeing Hispanic Montalban playing an Oriental isn't too embarrassing (though it's a good thing his part is short). And there's some nice touches of humor like that of Brando's head hitting the top of Button's and Umeki's inside doorway more than once. Red and Miyoshi themselves deserve their Oscars especially Red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout. Rookie Garner, before being cast in his legendary role on TV's Marverick, is fine in his scenes with Brando and Miiko Taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an anti-American. While I've read there were some changes from James Michener's novel, I can't imagine director Josha Logan, who had previously adopted another Michener work into the Broadway musical South Pacific and would eventually make that into a movie as well, not staying true to the original source. He certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist. Some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise, Sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the '50s mores that permeated America and Japan at the time.

Sayonara, directed by Joshua Lang and starring Marlon Brando, is one such film.The film revolves around several interracial romances, two involving American soldiers and Japanese women, and the third involving the relationship between an American woman and a Japanese man. The film pretends to be socially progressive, but spends most of its running time employing white male fantasies about the Oriental Other, Oriental women existing to fulfil titillating promises concerning their sexual subjugation to white males. Promotional posters and tag-lines for the film even proudly read I am not allowed to love, but I will love you if that is your desire, further emphasising not only the passivity and submission that the film attributes to Japanese women, but the marketing intentions of the film. It expressly plays to male fantasies surrounding subjugation.Original posters for the film even featured the film's star, Marlon Brando, forcibly grabbing a Japanese woman from behind, in a position of captivity or bondage. So though it pretends to be about love, the film holds an ideologically conservative attitude toward race (gender and class) within a fantasy that purportedly condemns racism. Interracial sex is then meant to become a cynosure for racial harmony, racial equality and newly built national alliances (David Lean's The Bridge Over The River Kwai had a similar function, the bridge an olive branch between nations).This is a common trope in cinema. Be it Avatar, Monster's Ball, Dances With Wolves, Lone Star, Heaven and Earth, Passage To India, The Searchers, A Man Called Horse etc etc, interracial sex is always used as a clunky metaphor for the soothing of racial tensions, the white man humping Mexicans, giant blue aliens, native American Indians, Asians and Africans as a form of racial therapy. This is miscegenation as affirmative action, the implication being that the Other can only be made whole again if the white man takes her in, accepts her, in a benevolent, paternalistic way. In other words, unless chosen for sex/love, unless deemed physically attractive by your suitor, you are forever debased, less than human, an animal, beneath compatibility with Homo Sapiens.These types of films rarely give the perspective of the woman; it is always the male symbolically inducting, from a position of authority, the foreign subject into the realm of Western norms of sex, civilisation and sexuality. When Sayonara does focus on a woman, it's an American girl, and it is her Japanese partner who is feminized. And of course such narratives always posit sex as being evidence against primitivism, rather than itself being a product of a primitive desire for ownership, domination, and a desire to be desired.The film was touted as offering a real glimpse into the life and culture of the Japanese, but this is not true. The characters are all overly exotic, stereotypes, and the film has no relation to the real Japan (the Japanese are not uptight, sexually repressed robots).Odd for such films, Sayonara portrays the military in a somewhat negative light, the military becoming a symbol of paternal authority, barring its lovers from true love. What's ironic about this is that eroticism cannot exist without barriers, so here the military isn't really standing in the way of anything, but actively pushing and eroticising alliances for the purposes of confronting communist Russia. The end result is a supposedly anti-racist, slightly anti-militarist (not really; it's mostly against silly military regulations and uptight American customs) film which is anti-racist and anti militarist for the purposes of militarism and racism. Sweet. I'm going to shoot the Pope to express my love for Jesus.7/10 - Most films about racism actually perpetuate racial stereotypes (The Defiant Ones, Monster's Ball, Color Purple, Crash, The Blind Side, Precious, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner etc), and Sayonara is no different. It's a condescending post-war attempt to re-humanise the Japanese, subconsciously indoctrinating us into needing them to such an extent in the fight against communism that it might even be acceptable to fall in love with one.Worth one viewing. "},{"Title":" --- is Katsumi's manner less socially acceptable and more demure than Tampopo ---?","Date":"7 November 2004","Score":"6 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Set historically during US engagement in the Korean War (1950-53), and post-WWII occupation of Japan (1945-52), Sayonara, adapted from James Michener's book, relates the romantic relationships of two military men stationed in Korea, Major Lloyd Ace Gruver (Marlon Brando) and squadron mechanic, Airman Joe Kelly (Red Buttons), with two Japanese women respectively, Hana-ogi (Miiko Taka), star of the Matsubayashi theater review, and Katsumi-san (Miyoshi Umeki). Ace, a fighter pilot of F-86 Saber jets, has shot down several Russian made, Chinese piloted MIG-15s over Korean airspace. The film begins with Gruver taking leave in Kobe (Kansai area), as requested by a superior officer who has arranged a (hopefully prenuptial) meeting between Ace and his daughter.The meaningful brunt of the storyline is carried by the romance between Kelly and Katsumi, and issues of interracial marriage (miscegenation) in the military. The term miscegenation gained common usage during slavery (1860s); but early colonial states also forbid interracial marriages. These civil laws and military policies were repealed by Congress in 1967. There were estimates of 300,000 interracial (international) marriages, involving US military personnel in Europe and Asia between 1944 and 1952, giving rise to the often disparaging term war bride. Even before the Roman Empire, romantic relationships between the military and local women had been (and still remain) among the more tenuous areas of military occupation.Some have been critical of Sayonara for insensitive stereotyping of Japanese culture, customs and behavior; but the film's most blatant stereotype is the good IL' boy portrayed by Brando. Objections have questioned the seemingly obsequious roles of Japanese women -- and in particular, Katsumi with her polite, self effacing manner. But in Japan's male-dominant society, is Katsumi's manner less socially acceptable and more demure than Tampopo (1986), the liberated, single, working mother and restaurant owner?My mother enjoys cultural affinity with the picturesque scenes of Japan's Kansai area and the colorful performances by the Takarazuka (Matsubayashi) ensemble. The on-location cinematography for Sayonara is outstanding, together with the art and set direction, the sound, and supporting roles of Buttons and Umeki (winning four Awards of ten Academy nominations). The film's core, and it's frills, are much better than some were willing to concede, over concerns for cultural insensitivity -- the direction, screenplay, production values, and supporting cast, with James Garner, Patricia Owens, and Ricardo Montalban are first rate.The Korean War -- which began with North Korea unilaterally entering South Korea on 25 June, 1950 -- will be remembered with controversy. It was the war where President Harry Truman fired commanding General Douglas MacArthur -- a bona fide hero in the Pacific, revered in the Philippines and respected in Japan. It was the war where we learned of Russian made MIG-15 jets, T-34 tanks, and AK-47 assault rifles -- and of the persistence and numerical superiority of Chinese troops. We learned the names of far away places like Seoul, Pusan, Inchon, Panmunjon, Pyongyang, Yalu River, and the 38th Parallel. We learned -- with three million civilian and military casualties, and after a negotiated peace and armistice in 1952-53 -- that nothing of substance changed. North and South Korea remained enemies for more than fifty years; and we should have learned to respect opponents with great resolve.After the Korean War, the United States failed to win another ground war in Viet Nam in the 1970s, (with another three million civilian and military casualties) -- against an enemy of even greater resolve. Possessing the most feared weaponry in world history, and demonstrating unmatched ability to destroy all life via air warfare, the US has failed to win two consecutive ground wars. The equation for winning a ground war is corollary to that of WINNING THE PEACE. In large part, it requires gaining the hearts and minds of the people; and the major weapon - the only acceptable weapon - is a strategic, resourceful, and patient diplomacy. It has to be better than sixty million civilian and military deaths in the twentieth century.

His southern drawl was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. Brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. Tyrone Power, in Witness for the Prosecution, should have been nominated for best actor instead of Brando here.The film, dealing with racism, dealt with the U.S. government's attempt to avoid marriages between U.S. soldiers and Japanese women.Brando was stone-faced throughout the movie. His moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.Only the lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received supporting Oscars for their performances. Nothing about either performance was equally impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka, who did nicely as Brando's love interest. She showed great emotion as the anti-American who found love with the Brando character. Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in World War 11. She realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in The Ten Commandments to the bigoted mother of Brando's love interest at first. Her performance together with the one of Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.

In the social sciences, the Other is a pan-applicable category which labels those facets of a culture that incur self-loathing.   In  Sayonara, the Other is blatantly  feminine.Women in this film are treated derogatorily, this is obvious. No less subtle is the negative attitude towards aspects of Japanese culture, even landscape, labelled feminine (vs. masculine American).  Gender ambiguity defines Japanese culture in the film as well as in the colonial imagination (Said, 1978).  Such androgyny is horrifyingly Other. The opening scene shows our hero being ordered off to Japan, to tango with the...dolls.  This is our introduction to a sad treatment of women of all ethnicities within the film.  Ace's ex-girl has an enormous capacity to fill a bathing suit.  Kelly's girl is a slant-eyed runt.  An elite academy of artists is referred to as The Girl Opera.  Eileen, the strongest and most well-developed woman character in the film, thinks too much. Association with the feminine, as well, has an emasculating effect.  Kelly goes nuts, crazy with love, so much so that he is willing to give up his citizenship, even to die, for his Oriental girl. Ricardo Montalban is kept from being a threat to American masculine sexuality by being made ritually asexual he plays a Japanese man and a Kabuki actor with feminine roles.  He is doubly a eunuch. Women are objects, stuff, goods in this film. There's the shocking bitchy bachi scene, with the goods on display; and the juxtaposition of white porcelain nudes gazing lovingly from his desk at the colonel who chastised his miscegenating G.I.s.  To the colonel, and the major, Japanese girls are mere sex objects for young soldiers.  They order them home to get them out of unseemly, awkward marriages.  The boys go safely home, deserting what are portrayed on stage and with mood music as sly vixens.When Ace finally takes control of his thoughts and his life from  the U.S. military, it is with the statement that I'm not thinking, and I don't want to think.  He is crazed, transformed by the Japanese effeminate he is discovering in himself the savage turns tender. Hanaogi tells Ace, With you I could become a woman,  explaining (and eventually denigrates) her own values, which define her life.  She moves from Oriental to Western mores, wanting to become a woman, a wife, a mother, and eventually grow old and teach dancing to my own children. Japan and the Japanese come second to her now.    Um, God Bless America.   "}]
