To be allowed to say or do whatever he pleased, whenever he pleased.  To eat anything he wanted, to go to bed late, to not go to school, to act or behave as he pleased without reproach.  To be his own adult.  Usually those kind of thoughts permeated our little minds right after a heavy-duty punishment.  In 1990's Home Alone, we saw a broad, comical take on this fantasy.  With 1963's Lord of the Flies, we get to experience the flip side.Lord of the Flies was required reading in junior high school.  William Golding's dark, sobering allegory, set during wartime London, tells the story of a large group of young schoolboys airlifted out of England who are left to their own devices after a plane crash leaves them marooned on an uninhabited isle with no surviving adults.  As the boys struggle to adapt to their crude but strangely exotic Robinson Crusoe existence, the troop begins to splinter into two opposing sects after failing to come to terms on an autonomous code of ethics.  Most of the boys decide to revel in their unsupervised freedom, reverting to primitive, animal-like behavior while resorting to barbaric acts and ritualistic practices.  A conch shell becomes the embodiment of power; a boar's head a symbol of lordly conquest.  On the other side, a minority group try to repel the tempting force of evil by forming a more civilized commune.  Eventually the survival of the fittest factor sets in as the anointed leader of the hostile group incites violence to force an autocracy. Golding's fascinating premise certainly does not hold much hope for the future of mankind.  We are conditioned as a people to be civilized; it is an acquired trait, NOT an inherent trait  &#150;  according to the author.  And if and when the shackles of goodness and purity are at any time removed to the extent that we are allowed to become our own social and moral dictator, we will invariably revert back to what comes naturally.  And with a child, who has been less-conditioned, it will take little time at all.  Evil is stronger, easier, and much more seductive.  When playing good guys and bad guys as a kid, which did YOU prefer to be?Boasting a surprisingly natural cast of amateur actors and directed by radical stage director Peter Brook (Marat/Sade), this lowbudget British effort impressively captures much of the novel's back-to-nature symbolism that I found so powerful and fascinating.   The young masters representing good and evil, James Aubrey (Ralph) and Tom Chapin (Jack), effectively portray the resolute leaders of the two disparate tribes, while butterball Hugh Edwards as the bespectacled, philosophical Piggy and towheaded Tom Gaman as the quietly sensitive Simon are touching as two of the weaker followers who become likely targets of the surrounding chaos and burgeoning brutality.  What I love most about this cast is that they act like little boys, not little actors, grounding their often awkward actions and behaviors in reality.  Trivia note one of the secondary boy players is none other than Nicholas Hammond, who went on to play young Friedrich in the film classic The Sound of Music two years later.Brook's use of grainy black-and-white photography, plus the lack of any comprehensive musical score (remember Tom Hanks' Castaway?), accentuates the bleakness of its surroundings and feelings of isolation.  The movie can hardly be expected to capture fully every single intention of this highly complex novel (most don't), but it does respect Golding's words and captures the very essence of what he wanted to say.  For that alone it should be applauded. By the way, don't waste your time on the 1990 color remake featuring professionals like Balthazar Getty.  The poetic beauty is all but dissipated in this haphazard, jarringly Americanized update.  It makes me worship Peter Brook's version even more.And what story could BE more disturbing yet topical than The Lord of the Flies as it applies to today's latch-key society?

To those who have commented here about the differences between the book and this film these are two very different mediums. Brook did not attempt a straight adaptation, he presented Golding's story through his own vision and emotional lens.The use of non-professional children is one of the things that make this a brilliant film, and vastly superior to the obnoxious 1990's version. If you pay attention to the opening minutes of Brook's film, you will notice that the world presented is nice, normal, clean, and functional. The boys deliver their lines well and the story flows smoothly. Once the boys are on the island, the scenes aren't nearly so smooth in transition, the speech becomes very awkward and the boys interaction with each other is stilted and unnatural.That is the point! These children know the direction they are going is wrong, to a boy they know this. Yet as individuals they are helpless to stand up to the group. Their awkwardness flows from their fear of being cast out, while yearning to be rescued and return to their homes. The nightmarish quality of the situation is well reflected in the hesitant speech and graceless movements. The uneasy stringing together of scenes makes the viewer squirm, hopefully making the connection to how ill at ease and unnatural the boys themselves must feel.I'm sure most of you have been around boys of this age at some point in your life. They are prone to being tongue-tied, have few social graces and lack physical co-ordination. That's what makes this film so utterly believable, the boys are real boys, not pimped-out Hollywood trick ponies, delivering their lines in perfect Shakespearean English, while nimbly doing complicated dance moves and mugging their perfect little faces square at the camera.Golding's book is a masterpiece that can be taken on several levels. Brook's film offers no fewer interpretations of the deeper meaning while presenting a realistic and horrific vision of the basic story. I know most people simply will not get this film. That's too bad because it is a classic.

When it came to making a film of 'Lord of the Flies' some of the greatest screen writers and playwrights of the day had a go at producing a script for it - all of them being turned down by Golding himself. Finally, it was decided to attempt the film as a sort of Drama Workshop. Thus it was that 30+ boys, plus director Peter Brook, a film crew and the regulation chaperones found themselves living in a bunk house, which had been an old canning factory, on the island of Vieques off Puerto Rico, with little more than copies of the novel and an outline of the idea and the limitation of the school holidays in which to make the film.The result defies belief. This is a masterpiece of Youth Drama, years ahead of its time. Even today, 40 years on, it is still staggering in its truth and clarity. The powerful imagery, chilling in its simplicity, far transcends anything which could be achieved with present day digital trickery. Not for this film the obvious blood and guts of action horror; here we have the most unspeakable acts made far more terrifying by their very understatement. (Simon's death must be one of the foulest acts ever filmed - but then, in reality, it was not - it is all in the imagination of the viewer and becomes far more terrible than any actual depiction of the act of  ritualistic murder could ever be!).When the great day of reckoning comes, this film will stand head and shoulders above all other film adaptations of novels.

I love the book; I didn't need to read it for school, but I read it anyway and enjoyed it. I understood the message Golding brought about. Then why am I not offended by this movie as I was by Lord of the Rings?This film is an excellent translation of Golding's novel. It is stark, bold and well directed. The young cast are frighteningly talented, especially Chapin and Edwards. This has everything I expected and much more. Perhaps I was wishing for a more vivid Lord of the Flies scene, but it brought it's message across and kept everything in the book alive. I marvel every time I see Edwards' Piggy. I can't understand the capacity the boy had at such an age. Jack was well portrayed also, as was Ralph.The ending was perfect. I admit the music did throw me off a tad but everything else just came so willingly. The emotions of the boys practically leaked out through to me, and that one little boy in particular (I've forgotten his name, I'm afraid - is it Percy?) looking up at the sea-captain just personified everything that the ending symbolised. This film is one of my favourites and I cannot see how anyone could fault it so drastically.

I found it to be quite good, and a hell of a lot better than the 1990 version, which alters all too many important moments and characteristics of the book. Reading over these comments, I was very confused. 1. The story and moral of Lord Of The Flies is so haunting and powerful that it does not need an overly dramatic score. The tune that Jack and his choir sing around the island is just the right touch. 2. Of course the acting wasn't as amazing as it could have been! Everyone seems to be forgetting just how young and inexperienced these boys were. Besides, the character's in Golding's story are just as young, and act their age (however violent and disturbing it may be). I found the camera work to be quite lovely. The film uses beautiful shots, which only enhance it even more. The final scene is one of my favorites. My only bone to pick is how quickly the film goes through the events in the book. I really do wish it would have slowed down a bit, and concentrated more on such characters as Simon, as well as the boys transformation into savages. Overall I found this adaption of Lord Of The Flies to be fantastic. My advice to future viewers of this film is to read the book first, definitely watch this 1963 version afterwards,and completely avoid the 1990 version all together.

After more than forty years of its release, the film is still a good way to get to know Mr. Golding's masterpiece, as Mr. Brook stayed truthful with the screen play he wrote.The mere idea of children shipwrecked in an island to fend for themselves, as they make a world of their own, was quite revolutionary when Mr. Golding wrote the story. To witness what children are capable of doing in extreme circumstances is an eye opener. In fact, the children put into practice what they have seen of their society as they realize they are stuck in an island without any indication of anyone looking out for them.Although some criticism has been expressed in this forum about the way the accident happens, and the way the boys come from all parts as they first gather in the beach, Mr. Brook's intentions seem to be more into the theatrical staging of this scene as the different groups come together. The best scene being the group lead by Jack as they march on the beach singing Kirie Eleison in their sweet and melodious voices.Cruelty is the most notorious trait the boys display for one another. That, and the leadership that Jack wants to take away in forming his own tribe and the complete breakdown in the communication among the boys. Mr. Golding was telling us that given to certain circumstances, man, or children in this case, will revert into being savages and that perhaps society's role is to keep people controlled into what is known as a civilized world.Peter Brook made an excellent film, but perhaps his biggest achievement is the magnificent work he got out of the mostly unknown cast of young children. There are no false notes, especially in the principals. With the notable exception of James Aubrey, who plays Ralph, none of the other boys had a film career, although one sees the promise in some of them. Tom Chapin is good as Jack. Hugh Edwards gives a heart wrenching account of Piggy, the boy that is ridiculed by the rest and betrayed by Ralph in telling the new arrivals about his nickname. Tom Gaman as Simon also had some good moments.This film shows Peter Brook at his best.

As the war in Vietnam was raging in the 60s and 70s, this film provided a distinctcommentary on the times.

The book was not only a first-rate adventure story, but a parable of our times. While back in 1954 kids killing each other took some strong believing, today you can see Golding's prediction being chillingly accurate. Nine years later, stage director Peter Brook would direct the film version that generated many mixed reviews. Some called it unprofessional and rushed, while others praised it as a classic. When the terrible American remake was released in 1990, many looked back at this version as a classic, and rightly so.     Brook's film opens with a very creepy montage consisting of pictures of a British boarding school intercut with planes flying over London with a haunting school chorus playing in the background. We learn that the world has been caught in a nuclear war and all the kids in the school were evacuated on planes. One plane crashes into the sea during a thunderstorm. The only survivors are kids ranging from six to twelve years old. Knowing they are trapped on a deserted island, they decide to re-start civilization.     The leader is Ralph (James Aubrey), one of the oldest kids who calls on assemblies with a conch. His buddy is Piggy (Hugh Edwards), a fat nerdy kid with glasses who is ignored by the other children even knowing he is the most mature. The bully is Jack (Tom Chaplin), a trouble chorus leader who quickly evolves to a Nero-like totalitarian leader and begins to lead the boys into savagery. The neutreal Christ-like figure is quiet Simon (Tom Gaman) who fails to fit in with others. The kids eventually split up to two tribes after many disagreements, one tribe consists of savage hunters led by Jack, while the other tribe led by Ralph is worried about being rescued.     Like the book, Peter Brook's THE LORD OF THE FLIES is a parable of the world under different political views. Piggy and the conch represent order and are both eventually ignored. Ralph represents a democracy while Jack represents a totalitarian form of leadership. Simon represents Christianity, although he is also ignored for most of the time. The kids undergo many conflicts, most ending in tragic results.      Today, Golding's novel is a subject in many school discussions, and some people today criticize it for being unrealistic and irrational. But after all, it is a parable. In real life, it is obvious the kids wouldn't last for very long.      Not believing professional child actors would deliver acting strong enough to portray such characters, Brook decided to cast non-actors that lived close to the island of shooting. This benefits the film greatly since Brook coaches great performances out of the kids (were some of them really acting?) and the fact that the actors are all unknown adds to the realism (This technique could be compared to the recent CITY OF GOD.) But the film's secondary performances are not as good. The kids usually take long pauses in between their lines, and for most of the time they seem to be reading them. Poorly reading them, in fact. To make things worse, the movie was dubbed on post-production due to the low-budget. This makes some of the scenes awkward, mute, and out of synch. May I also add the scenes are edited abruptly, making the whole thing seem rushed. It's sad that the film had to be cut to 90 minutes, considering an extra 30 minutes of footage would improve it. This process slows down the film, making it sometimes boring and tiresome.     This, by no means, is a bad movie. Brooks direction and Tom Hallimans cinematography put the 1990 remake to shame. The island locations (Puerto Rico) look dark and menacing in B&W, the kind of atmosphere the remake lacked. Brook is able to compose beautiful sad visuals. ***SPOILERS*** These include the kinetic editing during the hunt for Ralph, Simon's dead body floating in the water arranged by the sad school chorus (depressing moment), Piggy's tragic demise that puts the 1990s remake laughable mirrored scene to shame, and the very scary feast that occurs at night followed by the dance. That scene, consisting of quick images, scary close-ups on the savages painted faces, and disturbing screaming is very strong even for today's standards. Brook is also wise on deciding to omit the Lord of the Flies scene and only suggesting it. He does a batter job at it than Harry Hook did in the remake. Imagine the pain of actually filming that scene. ***END OF SPOILERS***     While the out-of-synch audio, some poor acting, and slow pacing might keep this movie away from the recent generation, it is still an underrated classic on its own right. It is disturbing, haunting, and visually wonderful. It really deserves to be seen twice to be really appreciated. Strongly recommended for those that never read the book and an essential preference over the remake.

This film, like its written counterpart, can be taken two different ways. In one aspect, Lord of the Flies is an enjoyable adventure story, with several elements of horror, as well. From another point-of-view, the position William Golding obviously took when he wrote his novel, Lord of the Flies is an paradigm of human nature. The film does its novel justice in discussing both literally and figuratively the primordial nature of man and how the superego plays a major role.Symbolism is abundant in this film. Ralph, the protagonist, represents democracy and rightness, while Jack, the antagonist, represents totalitarianism and wrongness. Furthermore, the conch Ralph uses to attempt to establish rules represents governmental order and decorum. While Ralph struggles with a small amount of boys to build huts (representing safety and man's dependence on nature), Jack is out with his hunters killing pigs, signifying their fall into savagery.Piggy, Ralph's sidekick of sorts, is asthmatic and unwilling to help with chores, but nonetheless represents intelligence and clearsightedness. The fact that Piggy is mocked, ignored and the object of derision exemplifies the real life fact that true intelligence is usually not paid any attention. When Piggy is killed the conch is shattered into thousands of little fragments. This represents the complete termination of any sense of intelligence, rationality or order the island may have at once had.Simon, the most introspective of the characters and a true loner, represents Jesus Christ. He faints when the choir boys first meet Ralph and he offers some of his meat to Piggy when no one else would share with the corpulent young boy. Early in the novel a young boy with a mulberry birthmark raises the question of a beast, which he says he saw moving through the foliage one night. Simon says it was him going to meditate but the littlun's (the small children) are still nervous. When Simon finds a dead parachutist atop the island (which Sam and Eric saw and mistakenly believed was the beast) he staggers down the island's mountain to tell the boys that the beast is not real. This is reminiscent of Christ staggering under the weight of his own cross.However, Jack, his men, and even Ralph and Piggy, are caught up in a festive tribal dance. When Simon appears he is mistaken for a beast and beaten to death. When this occurs, wind causes the parachute atop the island to detach from the twigs which snagged it and the dead parachutist's body flies out to sea as Simon is dragged out to sea, as well. This shows that Simon was and forever will be the only one of the boys to truly know where the beast was the entire time in their hearts.Roger, an inimical character representing the embodiment of pure evil and sadism, is the one who kills Piggy. He gets sadistic pleasure from torturing pigs, and he enjoyably kicks down sand castles the littlun's build and throws stones at Henry. Roger is the personification of the base stage of the human psyche evil.Sam and Eric, twins collectively known as Samneric, represent society. They are naturally good and assist Ralph with collecting fruit and building huts. However, Jack eventually captures them and they are forced to join his tribe. When Jack and his men hunt Ralph near the end of the film, Samneric reluctantly give in and inform Jack of Ralph's hiding place, showing that anarchy caused them to lose all sense of loyalty to others.Lord of the Flies is truly a masterpiece. It exemplifies Freudian thought, observable human behavioral characteristics, and the incontrovertible reality of the human psyche. The superego, the part of our brain concerned only with our own survival, can take over if rules are not existent. Society keeps humans sane, and lack of civility will inevitably lead to savagery.Yes, Lord of the Flies is a great adventure story, but it is also the greatest representation of the human spirit ever created. Praise Golding for the invention, and praise Brooks for his wonderful interpretation.

Actually, a film is most scary when it provokes fear on a most basic level. This is not a story that is scary because of plot twists or original characters.

The boys set up their own government, with Ralph in charge. But things start to fall apart very quickly.The set up is perfect. All the boys are perfectly cast, and their performances are strong all around. All the characters are likable in the beginning, which is important because as Roger Ebert (I think) said, a person is scarier when the viewer knows more about them.The directing is perfect. Even though the film is in black and white, the imagery still retains a sense of wonder and awe. Each shot is perfectly used to create the optimum effect. Pacing is key here, because if it is too slow, the film gets boring, but if it goes by too fast, the film feels rushed. The director nails it perfectly.

I didn't really care to think why.Watching this movie as a grown up (especially as a grown up trying to think about anything BUT work) made me ponder several things about human behavior. For instance, what makes one person lead and another follow? Why is there almost always just 2 prominent sides to a situation, even though there are people involved whose opinions may be of varying shades of gray? Isn't it strange that once you commit an act of taboo, that it just makes it so much easier to do the next time? Why is an act that is morally reprehensible to perform individually, become so much easier when it is done in group? Where does one's individualism go when mob rule prevails ? I think the movie did a good job of bringing out the beast, but it didn't surpass my initial impression from reading the book. The acting was commendable, given the age and experience of the actors, and the classic novel they were trying to portray. Ralph was just superb, trying to lead with reason, but watching his leadership ebb to a much more terrifying alter ego. The relentlessness and inevitability of his fate was captured in all its horror when he is told They're going to hurt you, Ralph.Its hard to write a review about just the movie, when the story itself (as told in the book) is what makes the biggest impression. The movie is rich in metaphors - innocence lost, war, society in general, right and wrong, etc. In closing, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for fear, but not of the sensational variety that 'horror movies' are generally associated with. Its a black and white movie, made in the 60's, and stars a bunch of scrawny kids. The fear is what you have to not watch - but live.

My immediate association was with my and other Third World countries, where many children are abandoned by the Government in their poor communities, and without education, perspectives in life and laws, become very young criminals working in gangs of drug dealers and thieves. In this movie, it is exposed how primitive a kid can be without the authority and respect, and this sort of violence is in the headlines of our newspapers almost every day.

(The exception that proves the rule being One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest--not better than the book, but definitively it's equal.) So, I just watched the movie, and cannot recommend it highly enough. Go into it with the question of what makes us human, what civilization is, and how we deal with our need for social living, and then consider ALL sides of the matter before making a judgment.The movie making itself isn't all that perfect. But the way in which Brook present's the story--as a tableaux without a message, leaving it for us to decide--more than redeems any inconsistencies in film technique or the acting.Someone above mentioned that it is hard to talk about the movie without talking about the story itself. And that is true. So, that said, I just wanted to comment that I'm disappointed in what seems to me to be a rather facile interpretation of Golding's work that seems prevalent amongst the comments--the easy assignment of virtue to Ralph and Piggy and savagery to Jack and his followers. Commenters keep noting a reversion. The conch represents civilization and democracy, Jack (or, more properly, the boar's head) totalitarianism and barbarism.But the question goes a bit deeper than that. Ralph starts off with the power and the trust. But his response to the situation the kids find themselves in is a passive one--he wants to build a fire and wait to be rescued. Jack is described as power hungry a number of times in comments, but the readers fail to note that if not by show of hands the first time, by show of feet the second time the kids withdraw the power from Ralph--i.e., the scene in which he says what if I blow it and they don't come when Piggy tells him to summon the kids with the conch. And the ultimate question is not about whether Jack is power hungry and Ralph virtuous, but rather why the children chose to follow Jack and not Ralph.THe answer is very clear. Jack was a stronger leader than Ralph. Ralph wanted to be rescued--Jack sought to deal with the situation as it was. Materially, Jack was able to provide meat to the kids because he was able to arm and discipline his choir boys. Socially, Jack was able to forge a bond with his followers, his tribe, that gave them a reason to accept his leadership, while Ralph could only offer leadership based on a momentary common consensus. And in the end, Jack could protect his followers, Ralph could not. It is significant that the two boys with Ralph in the scene mentioned above are Simon and Piggy--in the end, in allying themselves with him, they end up dying, while Roger, the first to desert to Jack, survives. To see Golding's story as a reversion to savagery misses, I think, the whole point. It was not a reversion the boys underwent, but, rather, an adaptation to the circumstances in which they found themselves. They didn't go naked because they were suddenly nothing but monkeys, they went naked because it was the better adaptation to the environment in which they found themselves. They didn't accept Jack because they had become uncivilized, they accepted Jack because under the circumstances, he offered more in terms of social utility than Ralph could. It is understanding this that we understand how totalitarian regimes do take power--that people don't adopt them because they've reverted to savagery, but rather that an extremity of circumstances compels certain behaviors in order to survive. Jack's power wouldn't have been possible without his choirboys armed with spears, but neither would the meat he brought his tribe. The respective prime followers of Ralph and Jack, Piggy and Roger, are very interesting in that they represent the conflicting elements in human civilization, that to protect the weak and that to hurt it. Intelligence is perceived as weak in a society on the edge because its rewards are not reaped immediately, Raplh's glasses can start a fire, but the kids are still at the mercy of someone seeing it; while brute strength and violence does, as in the killing of the pig, reap immediate rewards. It concerns me that this novel is being taught improperly in schools, as an allegory for good vs. evil rather than as testamentary to the human condition and the choices we make in order to survive. Golding's work is a brilliant examination not of human morality, but of human society and its many layers, and it is a shame to reduce to Ralph good, Jack bad Manichean dichotomy.

Golding's novel isn't a racial parable or a story about star-crossed lovers, but a dark, biblical allegory with a message about as crippling and as thought-provoking as anyone I can think of. It's not an easy read, with lots of imagery spelled out in grand detail and a plethora of ambiguous symbolism. And for that matter, it's not a very easy watch. One must go in prepared and open-minded to truly enjoy what Peter Brook's Lord of the Flies brings.The story is simple. After a horrific plane crash, a group of young schoolboys are left stranded and ill-equipped to try and sustain themselves on a remote island surrounded by water as far as the eye can see. There are no adults, the pilot is dead, and their home country of England is now involved with what will be known as World War II. We are first greeted with plucky young Ralph (Aubery), who will later become selected leader of the island, with his leadership resembling a fair and balanced democracy. Ralph's best friend on the island is a chubby boy named Piggy (Edwards), who remains realistic about the situation that the boys will be condemned to this island until they die.Another boy on the island named Jack (Chapin), quickly embraces life on the island, and turns to barbaric and savage intentions as the antagonist whose only care is to hunt and kill. He becomes symbolic for Satan, while another boy named Simon (Gaman) becomes almost a Christlike figure, with his excessive assistance to the boys and authentic kind nature.The moral of the novel and film is quite interesting, and is open for some heavy debate. Golding states that the only reason humans are kept in place and are civilized is because of law and order, and if those laws were ever to be lifted at any given time, that at first, people would try to remain civil, but would soon become virtually consumed by their savage instincts. We act on our superego, meaning we do what we believe is right, and if laws didn't exist, we'd most likely act on our id, our impulsive inner-evil if you will. Over the course of the film, it seems like in no time these once well-kept, collective children are consumed by their own inner-desires to act on impulse and not fear any consequences at all. This makes for a very unsettling picture, especially in the last half-hour when some unthinkable scenes occur.Hook's direction sets up a consistently tense and very detailed atmosphere. The cinematography is also commendable, only complimented by the dreary silence because of the choice to omit any formal music. Hook manages to incorporate some rather tricky tracking shots, and some birds-eye shots that are difficult to successfully pull off. Apparently, the film was shot on an island in Puerto Rico, and very little scripting was done. Much of the dialog is improvised, which works for and against the film simultaneously. There is a great feeling of authenticity when a film or show is improvised, but here, the children, all of them I believe to be first time actors with some never even returning to film again, recite their lines in a strange, unnatural way, which takes time to get used to. It provides inevitable corniness, but thankfully, can't derail the entire film all together.Not to mention, the pacing feels a little off. Sometimes, long periods of silence go on, and we are unsure of where the film is going. Although a little odd, it provides time for the cinematography and atmosphere to take effect, projecting a feeling of dread and uncertainty. Throughout the film and the novel, the boys are fearing, what they call the beast, which refers to the unknown on the island. The boys constantly believe some creature is out to get them, and this fear consumes them, much like their feelings of barbarism and savagery. This is where the film begins to hit home. What kid didn't dream of living by his own rules, in a place where he/she could do and say whatever they wanted? It isn't until that dream becomes a reality do we begin to regret our wish. The true tragedy is these boys didn't wish for this.Lord of the Flies was a challenge to adapt to film, and director Peter Brook clearly accepted it with gratitude and honor. He has great respect for Golding's original work, keeping the biblical theology and references in place, and rarely tampering the original events, making this a successful adaptation. I still feel the need to reiterate the fact that the phrase the book is always better than the movie is a void statement, seeing as the film adaptation can never be truly everything you wanted it to be. This is because the film is based off the director and/or screenwriter's interpretation of the story. As far as that works, Brook's is on par with mine, but perhaps the more important question is, is it on par with yours? Starring James Aubrey, Tom Chapin, Hugh Edwards, and Tom Gaman. Directed by Peter Brook.

Yes, the cast was talented in a non-professional way and that is perhaps what made the film work. But the real story of how the film was made is this Off set was very much like on set. We lived in an abandoned pineapple warehouse and all called each other by our movie names. There was a split in the cast - sort of one gang against another - although in the real life one Jack and Ralph were on the same side (the leader of the other gang being one of the other choir boys). The gangs would make war on each other with Jack and Ralph's bunch headquartered out in the cane fields while the other bunch had a metal scaffold fort near the warehouse. In the beginning the cast was more of less evenly split but in the end I found I was on the losing side since we were down to only two people! So, filming was not all that difficult for the kids and much of it was simply letting us go at it. For instance the hut building scene was turned into a contest of who could build the best hut with a watermelon being the prize. That the cameras were going was only a secondary concern for the kids. Anyways, it was fun and make for some great childhood memories.

Nearly a decade later, the first movie adaptation of the book saw the light of day. Adaptations of novels can be excellent, while others may generally be disappointing. This 1963 adaptation of William Golding's famous novel turned out to be sort of a mixed blessing.A large group of English schoolboys find themselves stranded after a plane crash, without any surviving adults. Shortly after the crash, two of them meet for the first time. One of them is Ralph, and the other's real name remains unknown. The other boy tells Ralph about his undesired nickname, Piggy, and unfortunately, that is what he is called from then on. Ralph and Piggy don't see any other boys around, so Ralph uses a shell (or a conch) to call them. With all the boys gathered, Ralph is elected as the leader for the time they are stranded, and it is soon discovered that they are on an island. Ralph tries his best to keep the rest of the boys civilized, and tells them that a smoke signal must be kept going in order for them to be rescued. However, a rivalry soon begins between Ralph and the power-hungry Jack, and many boys end up on Jack's side, creating a group of savages! The first thing you may be wondering about this movie is how faithful to the novel it is. Quite a bit of detail from the story was removed for this movie (which often happens with adaptations of novels), so if you've read the book, remembering some parts that you found really interesting, and you'd like to see how they're done in this movie, you may be disappointed to see that some of them are not included. However, apart from that, I would say the movie tells the original story very well, but it definitely has some other problems. The cinematography is pretty amateurish, and the cast is, well, not terrible, but not great. Personally, I found some of the movie dull, so I had trouble getting into it at times, but also found certain parts interesting or somewhat moving (though not as much so as I was expecting).This Lord of the Flies adaptation definitely hasn't impressed every admirer of the book, which I can understand. I was a tad disappointed myself (certainly not as much as some people, but still a tad disappointed). However, many other admirers of William Golding's piece of literature like this movie. For fans of the book who haven't seen this movie, if you want an adaptation that is faithful to the book (despite the unsurprising fact that the story is shortened), and you can get over the shortcomings I've mentioned, I recommend this movie. You just might not want to expect a work of genius.

A series of memories, nicely setting the mood of the story - photographs of boy's schools, of the situation at hand in the story, and of plane crashes, disaster. We get, though sometimes unclearly, that a plane has crashed during a war, and that there are presumably boys on board.With that note, the story becomes suddenly detached. The first acting scene starts with the British boys we inferred before, yet they are completely clean, and perfectly calm, and nothing can be seen of the fact that they've just survived a near brush with death. We see nothing of the remains of the plane, we see nothing of the scar that was referenced in the book - we have no idea if these boys are simply on a field trip. A key point for continuity - the tube escape system hinted at in the book, a possibility that the boys might have escaped in their condition. It was supposed to be technology, but we never find out about it - that key point was missed.So we start off with a break. Coming in to the movie, the first thing you'd notice is a horrible lack of pacing. When dialogue occurs, there are harsh pauses in between camera focuses on each character. Piggy speaks horribly slowly - although that could be attributed as a part of character - and the other characters seem perfectly sedate. It seems that they're simply waiting for a teacher to arrive. No sense of emotion, nothing.Progressing through the normal parts of the book, the dialogue and action is extremely slow. The camera would focus in on Ralph for a second, wait....then he'd say his line. This rough pacing brought down the entire feel of the movie.Granted, it was made in 1963. It is a black and white movie, and uses a different kind of cinematography we are used to today. But that is not apparent in movies made earlier in black and white - Hitchcock movies are paced amazingly. This is not an example of a good use of the technology available.But there were naturally certain redeeming points. The bloodlust in eating the first pig is pictured well, and the second half of the movie is much better, and easier to watch. There is a genuine frisson of tension while Ralph is being chased - although a flash or a glimpse of a possible attacher would make it more so - and the music and sound effects are used amazingly well; although there is one point, on the top of the mountain, when one line of music repeats over, and over, monotonously.The main problem, aside from the pacing, must have been the lack of a clear point to the tale - in the novel, there was a societal critique, and a perfect image of one's inner demons. In this movie - it lacks.Rating 6/10 "},{"Title":"Lord of the Flies (1963)","Date":"29 December 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Lord of the Flies is a real challenge to put on screen.

Brook never quite captures the feel of the novel, and a lot of the dramatic irony is lost in cinematic form. However, he does do a pretty good job and coaxing some very natural performances from the children, even if some of them do look directly at the camera every now and again.

As I recall, the movie got a lot of word-of-mouth back in '63. Many theatre-goers were discovering a world of cinema beyond the typical Hollywood product of the conformist '50's, and eager distributors were obliging. Of course, many viewers saw the boys' graphic descent into savagery as a profound comment on human nature. I suspect director Brooks was wise to toss aside the screenplay and improvise instead. After all, these are pre-pubescent boys and its darn hard to write convincing dialog for that age level, especially dialog with philosophical undertones.As a result, the narrative is told in visual fashion, with lots of crashing waves, screaming boys, and chanting refrains. To cover the sparse dialog, the sound track is unusually noisy, but many of the visuals remain memorable. Also essential is the abundant symbolism. For example, there're Piggy's glasses (reason), hunting instead of foraging (killing), along with the conch and the assembly (democratic values). Despite such allegorical references, I suspect contemporary viewers find the film less compelling after 50-years of unconventional movie-making that has worn away the original impact.Now, I haven't read the book, so I don't know how faithful the film is. But frankly I would have been more persuaded by the cynical subtext had the survivors been adults rather than 10-year old boys. After all, who's surprised that that age group would wind up shucking classroom constraints for going native.Then too, it's important to remember that art is a medium of manipulation (in a good sense) and not of proof. That is, an artistic narrative can illustrate a truth, but no matter how good, it can't prove it. For the latter, we have to go outside of art, mainly to the sciences. Thus, novelist Golding may illustrate a particular view of human nature, but the novel can hardly confirm its truth.All in all, the movie is worth catching up with since it remains a genuine curiosity, whatever the drawbacks.

Some good qualities are the closeness to the storyline and setting, but the film was poorly acted and produced. Peter Brook did a good job bringing the book to the screen, but I think he left out some important parts. This may have been done because some scenes were risqué at that time. Some scenes not present are the disappearance of the never-named boy with the birthmark and Ralph's encounter with the pig head, or Lord of the Flies. These two scenes are important in the story, but the movie manages without them quite well. The film was shot in the Caribbean using English schoolboys that had no experience in acting. The location and nationally worked excellently in this film, but the lack of experience shows when you can't hear the dialogue too well. Some scenes, mainly the hunting scenes, were poorly choreographed. This version is still better than the remake I believe. The remake has the children use profanity and makes references to television shows from its time period (1990). In the DVD version there are several extras which are interesting to watch. My favorites are the theatrical trailer with and without audio commentary about a major problem that almost happened at the film's premiere, deleted scene with and without commentary and a reading by author, William Golding, screen tests and outtakes, and the scenes from a documentary about director Peter Brook's theatrical techniques.You should read William Golding's book before watching this movie, and definitely watch this version before the remake.

Another book with the type of message earnest teachers can extract and teach, explaining life. Another thin process that fools young minds into pretending they understand. But set all that aside; it is a life this film was shuttled into apart from its original intent.And that intent is noble for sure. Brook was a stage director. His intent is not to moralize or tell a story. Like most stage dramatists, he doesn't mind those when they suit his purposes. But his main mission is to be affecting, to make an impression. And there's no compromise on that, constrained only by the sensibilities of British audiences of the time.So we have episodes only. And because these are inexperienced actors the episodes are shaped by three elements innocent faces, some fairly effective camera blocking, and one or two dramatic effects that have little to do with the source material. An example of the latter is the much quoted approach of a gang of robed boys across the beach to chants.If this has any magic at all, it is in the stagecraft, and that's what makes it somewhat interesting.Golding's original target was in the Austin tradition, to take a critical stance at society by merely describing it crisply. The message, a real one, is about the use of abstraction in understanding how we use abstraction to aggregate civilly. Austen-type introspectives, Golding and Brook all do this in different ways so the joy in this project is in seeing how they overlay.Pay attention to the way we are implied. Everything that is there is obviously arranged so that our eye can catch all the important elements. Its along the same lines of narrative purification as the book but visual the boys clump just so, not because of any social or physical law, but because our eyemind needs it so to see.My mind gets offended at all this cleanliness, all this order intended to explain disorder. Part of the offense is the way things have changed in the world of drama today we demand ever more simplicity and clarity, even more than Golding and Orwell and probably in part because we are taught them in school.And we also demand it with less subtlety, at least outside the art-house.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

TIME Magazine even included it on their list of the 100 Best English-Language Novels written between 1923 and 2005. The novel itself can be enjoyed on many fronts. If nothing else, it's a fascinating premise What WOULD a bunch of young boys do if stranded somewhere with no adults around, no rules, no laws, no structure or discipline and left to their own devices? The fact it also happens to rich as an allegory on human nature and societal structure is just the icing on top. Golding himself summed up his intent rather simply by stating it's ... about the problem of evil and the problem of how people are to live together in society. That basic concept is put front and center in director Peter Brook's film adaptation and relayed with power despite some obvious technical issues that arise.An airplane full of young British schoolboys - ranging from about 6 years old to early teens - crashes somewhere on an uninhabited island. Ralph (James Aubrey), the son of a Navy commander who thinks the paternal figure he idolizes will soon come find them, stumbles upon the chubby, insecure, bespectacled, talkative Piggy (Hugh Edwards) first and the two make their way down the beach, discovering more of their schoolmates as they go. Along the beach come a second and smaller group of slightly older boys, led by Jack (Tom Chapin). Things begin harmlessly enough, with the kids essentially viewing the experience as some extended camping trip. They play games, laugh, play pranks, gather fruit, start a fire and build a shelter from branches as they await rescue. Using a majority rules vote to establish a new leader in Ralph, the group set down a few basic ground rules at the outset to maintain order, like using a conch shell as a platform to speak without interruption and keeping a fire going at the island's highest peak so a passing aircraft may see it, but things quickly go to hell.Once one of the boys claims to see a snake-like shape-shifting beast stirring among the bushes at night (which later turns into a mythical sea beast), a seed of superstition and paranoia encroaches on the new society and things escalate from there. Jack and his group deem themselves the hunters, sharpen spears, paint their faces, dress in animal rags, leave pig heads on stakes as an offering to their perceived new God and quickly descend into a life of violent tribal savagery, while Ralph loses his power and his numbers once his rival proves he can provide better and has no issue using deadly force as a means to silence those who oppose the new way. After having swayed the majority of others over to his side, Jack and his few remaining allies realize their own lives are in grave danger.Filmed in 1961 in Puerto Rico, this low budget production had numerous technical issues that needed tended to before it could finally be released in 1963. The major problem was the audio, most of which was not actually recorded on location due to various natural noises the filmmakers really couldn't do anything about. As a result, most of the dialogue was dubbed in later and, sadly, they didn't do a very good job of it. Audio levels really seem off throughout. Many seem to have issues with the casting of inexperienced boys instead of trained child actors in all of the roles, which results in some wooden, amateurish and / or stilted dialogue readings. Personally it didn't bother me all that much, but it will some viewers. If you can ignore the above issues, this is a visually splendid film that's atmospherically photographed on beautiful locations and it manages to generate a great desolate feel apart from the 'civilized' world.Most importantly of all, Brook actually does the source novel justice. Very little of importance was left out and the director conveys exactly what the book is trying to say. That's especially impressive considering he had to narrow down around 60 hours (!) of total filmed footage to just 90 minutes for the theatrical release. Supposedly a 100-minute version was initially released to Cannes, but I don't believe that cut has ever been made commercially available. A more polished and bigger- budgeted color remake was made in 1990 by director Harry Hook. Though it's not a terrible movie, it lacks the character and artistry of this original version.

This is done with a sequence of still images young boys in an English prep school, boys in a choir singing Kyrie Eleison, boys playing cricket, missiles, bombers, evacuation notices to the London airport, an atom bomb, a plane in the water. These images are inter-cut with a drumbeat soundtrack. No further back-story needed.Many serious themes are broached, the overarching one being to consider what would ensue if the thin veneer of civilization were stripped away. The ninety minutes of the movie follow Golding's book fairly closely and we get his take on the theme by following what happens to some thirty-odd kids on an isolated Pacific island. One of the boys, Ralph (James Aubrey), recognizes the need for organization and the need for a leader. A vote is taken and Ralph is elected, but another boy, Jack, is a rival. Jack, having been chief chorister at the school, gets all of the votes from the choirboys, but none others. Any relevance to contemporary politics is not coincidental. Initially things go all right, with tasks being apportioned Jack will be in charge of hunting and keeping a fire going as a signal to any possible rescue ships. Ralph will oversee building huts and making executive decisions. Soon a power struggle develops between Ralph and Jack and Jack gets the upper hand, since he is the main provider of food.If you are so inclined, allegorical meanings abound, offering occasion for endless analysis and speculation. Segments of modern society are reflected in the personalities of the main characters Ralph the reasoned leader representing civilization; Piggy, the intellectual, Ralph's friend and moral adviser; Simon the gentle, dispassionate truth seeker; Jack the militarist; Sam and Eric, the common man. The conclusion that savagery triumphs over good is depressing, but at least there is a recognition that there can be noble impulses embedded in our DNA. Jack makes a comment early on, After all we're not savages. We're English and the English are best at everything. The irony of that statement is appreciated as the movie moves along.The origins of religion are shown to be rooted in fear, and used by the group in power to their advantage. The corpse of an airman is found and it is mistakenly taken to be a beast shrouded in mystery and feared. Jack, recognizing an opportunity, offers protection from the beast and sacrifices pig's heads to feed it to keep it at bay. Since young kids have the least exposure to civilizing influences (read restraints), the implication is that we are all part brute--unfettered ego and the will to power are what make most things go bad.If you are not inclined to allegory or deep meaning, then you can see this simply as an adventure showing what might happen to a bunch of school kids when set loose without authority. Their relationships become pretty much what they probably were in school Jack, a closet bully; Ralph, a straight-up kid; Piggy, a fat intellectual who was picked on; Simon, a quiet thinker; Sam and Eric, congenial get along guys. They become who they truly are, which is scary to think about. I thought the child actors were quite good, especially for kids with little or no acting experience. They did not speak with great eloquence, they spoke as kids in a believable manner. Hugh Edwards makes a perfect Piggy. Aubrey plays the final scene with such emotion that it had a powerful impact on me; he communicates a sorrow bordering on despair. In that final scene he is made to look much older, which would indicate the effect his experiences on the island have had on him.Black and white is the right medium for this story, since it puts the focus on the kids and their faces. In color the kids would be overshadowed by the lush tropical island setting. The scene near the end where Ralph encounters the sailor is stunning in black and white. Panning up from the sailor's feet along the length of his brilliant white uniform is inspired. The spotless uniform offers a great contrast to the shape the kids were in.The score by Raymond Leppard is gently supportive while being mostly unobtrusive after the opening credits. The choir singing Kyrie Eleison as they march along the beach in their black robes will likely stick in your mind. Fragments of this song are repeated on several occasions throughout the movie. Leppard's score lets the tense drama unfold naturally without having to hit you over the head by what emotion you should be having. Many of the scenes play with no accompanying music; silence is used to great effect.Perhaps Walt Kelly's Pogo quote best sums up the takeaway We have met the enemy ... and he is us.

Ironically, the man who eventually realized this task &#x96; distinguished British theater director Peter Brook making only his third film in 11 years &#x96; would eventually work closely with Bunuel's most regular collaborator in his twilight years, screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere, on THE MAHABHARATA (1989) &#x96; an ambitious adaptation of the epic Indian novel. I had myself studied the Golding book in school for my O level in English literature (the ominous title, the literal meaning of the word Beelzebub, was actually suggested by T.S. Eliot!) and I also have Golding's next work on my bookshelf, The Inheritors; frankly, although I had seen the film under review a long time ago on local TV, I had been postponing the purchase of the Criterion SE DVD for 10 years (it was one of the very first such editions I came across locally) but only recently relented once I learned of the Bunuel connection! While only two of the child actors (the recently deceased James Aubrey and Nicholas Hammond) engaged for the film would go on to pursue professional careers in the cinema, the most striking of them are the ones playing the villainous Jack Merridew (whose voice had to be dubbed given its overly Americanized inflections!) and the perennially victimized Piggy (whose demise is very effectively shot indeed). Actually, due to the constant noise of overhead flying planes, it was impossible to shoot live sound on the Puerto Rican location and all the dialogue had to be re-recorded &#x96; except for Piggy's anecdote of where his hometown got its name from (which was also exclusive to this film version).The post-apocalyptic island setting immediately elicits comparisons with other films depicting children in the aftermath of nuclear fallout like Joseph Losey's THESE ARE THE DAMNED (1963), Frank Perry's LADYBUG LADYBUG (1963; which I own but have yet to watch) and Peter Watkins' shot-for-and-subsequently-banned-by BBC-TV-film, THE WAR GAME (1965). Brook's previous work may have been primarily for the stage but one cannot deny that, in spite of the semi-professional nature of his cast and crew, he made a fluidly cinematic and powerful adaptation of the classic novel (as already alluded above).Although the funds emanated from an American source (producer Lewis Allen), the film is primarily thought of as a British production and it was considered as such when it competed officially at the Cannes Film Festival (where Luchino Visconti's THE LEOPARD eventually emerged victorious); incidentally, the version shown over there was slightly longer than the one subsequently released to theaters. Interestingly enough, Orson Welles had offered to edit down Peter Brook's original 4-hour rough-cut and during the film's theatrical premiere in New York, the final reel had had its soundtrack printed backwards! Finally, there was later a colour remake made in 1990 but I am not familiar with it.

There is much to be praised and much to be criticized among the latter the distracting background music and the translation of Christian symbolism from implicit to explicit. However, the strongest impression remains the genuine expression of deep, often overwhelming emotions, portrayed so beautifully by the non-professional cast. It is noteworthy that, in interviews published in the New Yorker magazine thirty years later, the now-grown boys recalled the experience of making Lord of the Flies as a signal step in their maturation and development. Although I believe only one went on to further work in the performing arts, they all returned from Puerto Rico (the filming location) older in more than months. Many argue against Golding's essential tenet that human nature is inherently evil and that civilisation provides only a veneer of protection, but whatever one's opinion this film highlights the issue with inescapable intensity.

However, after reading it, I did something I've never done before, I immediately reread it!!!  I couldn't get over how deep this book was.  I decided to rent the movie too, but all I could find was the 1990 version, while entertaining, didn't go as deep as it should have.  But when I finally got my hands on this version, I had another first for me, I found a movie that I liked better than the book! Even people who have never read or seen the Lord of the Flies, know the basic premise, a bunch of boys are stranded on a remote island without adult supervision, and their society quickly starts to collapse into savagery. This however does not do the real meaning of the story justice.  You have the leader, Ralph, who is just a simple kid trying to hold together the group and keep law and order.  You got his sidekick Piggy, who is portrayed as the last voice of reason.  And then you have Jack, who just wants to have fun and hunt.  The symbolism of this group of kids and humanity starts to become really clear.  Golding had a really depressing idea of human nature, and Peter Brook portrays it brilliantly.  I suggest reading the book and getting a good idea of what the underlying message was. Then watch this movie for a most excellent experience.  I give it a high score of 10, but with a warning of not to watch this if you get depressed easily, this is no light hearted deserted island story a la Swiss Family Robinson.

Basically a group of English school children, all boys, are stranded on a deserted island after surviving a plane crash, and eventually they all unite on the beach. The boys all decide they need a leader, so they put it to a vote, and they choose Ralph (James Aubrey), instead of Jack (Tom Chapin), and for a while he is able to steer the boys, all aged between eight and fourteen years old. They work together to build a civilised and co-operative society until they can be rescued, building shelters and making fires, but they also make wooden spears and have knives. With the lack of rescue and the arguments for authority there are growing tensions between all the boys, to the point when there is violence to find food, and the group split into two. Jack is the leader of the more savage half, and Ralph and Piggy (Hugh Edwards) are doing their best to keep the remaining boys together, but almost have to stay together by themselves. There is a point when the savagery between the departed boys that a large rock is pushed and it crushes Piggy, Ralph has to run away and hide in the jungle. In the end the island jungle is set on fire, and Ralph running comes across a naval officer, who is shocked to see the children's' behaviour, and presumably they all get rescued. Also starring Roger Elwin as Roger, Tom Gaman as Simon, Roger Allan as Piers, David Brunjes as Donald and Peter Davy as Peter. All the young male actors do really well as the attitudes flair and arguments turn violent, the most memorable characters being Ralph, Pigg and Jack, it is a good gripping story where authority and no help are what create the problems for the young people, and there are certainly some dark moments, overall it is certainly a drama to see. Very good!

However rough around the edges, this first adaptation of the classic William Golding novel captures the crux of the book, harnessing a youthful spontaneity that threatens to spill over into anarchy at any moment.We're not savages asserts one lad, the bossy Jack. We're English. And the English are best at everything.The story is the same in all but a few minor particulars. During a future war, a group of boys find themselves stranded on an island. Using a conch shell, some sharpened sticks, and a pair of broken spectacles, they construct a fragile society precariously balanced between hope of rescue and surrender to more primordial instincts. Jack is quite savage, it turns out, and only a fat outcast named Piggy and his friend Ralph understand that devoting their new life to hunt and have feasts and have fun is not all that good an idea.One reason the novel Lord Of The Flies endures is for how it remains a sturdy, involving adventure yarn even as it metaphorically examines the human condition in its darkest form. This adaptation maintains that balance fairly well, not lingering too long on any big metaphors.The oddness of the casting is striking at the film's beginning. Kids seem to stumble with their lines, miss cues, look at the camera, etc. Many shots focus on a boy staring into space while another is heard talking, suggestive of either synching issues or an actor's inability to deliver a key line convincingly.A lot of comments note a scene where members of Jack's choir give their names, each obviously waiting to be cued while the camera pans over them. The scene could have been cut out without missing anything; why did director Peter Brook leave it in?I think he wanted the raggedness of the performances precisely because it cuts against the grain of what you expect from films, cute boys delivering their lines crisply. You need to risk a bit of chaos to deliver a convincingly chaotic film, and chaos is what you get.Just like kids! sighs Piggy during one scene full of random running and shouting. Like a crowd of kids.Piggy, played by a young Alfred Hitchcock soundalike named Hugh Edwards, stands out for his on-point delivery, coming off at once as humane, order-loving, and a bit of a bore. His monologue about the naming of his hometown, Camberley, says all you need to know about the character in an amusing way, establishing both his likability and his irritation factor.The other two lead actors, James Aubrey (Ralph) and Tom Chapin (Jack) are solid, but it gets dicey from there. The lad playing Simon, a key role, seems on the verge of nodding off throughout, while the book's other major role, Jack's sadistic ally Roger, is reduced to a handful of words and silent stares. Jack in the book has a more nuanced relationship with Ralph and the others; here he comes across as a smug little brat hardly in need of Roger's help to transform the island into his private savage garden.The choice of shooting in black-and-white may have been budgetary but works at establishing a menacing mood that only deepens as the film progresses. To a large degree, mood is what makes this film succeed as much as it does. You feel a sense of dislocation around this group, which is just as it should be.

Unfortunately, that's starting to be a very long time ago! However, if memory serves correctly, I have to credit this movie for being a pretty faithful adaptation of Golding's story. The movie takes place entirely on a deserted tropical island (it's implied that it was in the Pacific, although the movie was actually shot in Puerto Rico.) It's intended as a critique of humanity's violent impulses which wonders what would happen if a group of young boys were isolated without adult supervision. The result, of course, is disastrous a short attempt at unity is destroyed by the jealousy between two rivals for the leadership of the group, there's a complete breakdown of the rules they had agreed to follow and the end result is a descent into savagery and violence. Two things stood out for me. The first were the performances by the three main leads as Ralph, Jack and Piggy, James Aubrey, Tom Chapin and Hugh Edwards (I would say especially Chapin) were quite convincing for the most part, although there were a few fluffs in the mix; a few times when they seemed to be trying a bit too hard and the result came across as less than credible. The second is the closing scene, as the boys gone wild are confronted by the sudden presence of adults as they're discovered by sailors from the British Navy, and - after all the horrors that have developed - they simply adopt a sort of oh, haven't we been naughty posture.There is something powerful about the study of how children would react to such a situation, but there's also to be honest an air of expectedness to the story. The early attempts at unity essentially have children trying to act like adults. That's perhaps understandable in the circumstances, but it also surely comes as no shock that they can't keep up that pretense for very long - after all, they're not adults. A devolution into some form of anarchy is surely to be expected. Even more interesting in some ways might be to watch the degeneration of a group of cultured adults facing the same circumstances, because then the chill would come from the sense that they should know better. Here, though - as violent as it is - what happens on the island doesn't shock me (and not only because I've read the book!) I can't say that I was truly enamoured with this film. I was bored to death by an opening sequence that seemed to go on and on with very little purpose, but once it got going, this was one of the more faithful reproductions of a novel I've come across in a movie.

Most people see Lord of the Flies as a film about the descent of a group of schoolboys into savagery.  I see it as a story about the collapse of democracy and the rise of totalitarism.Allow me to elaborate on that one.  William Golding wrote his novel in the years following World War 2.  Golding had observed to his dismay the collapse of German democracy and the rise of Hitler's Nazi regime.  Democracy failed in Germany primarily because the German people wanted it to.  Hitler then proceeded to crush all opposition and remilitarize Germany, much like Jack seduced the schoolboys to join him and  hunt down Ralph after Ralph had been fairly elected.  Similarly in the USSR Stalin came to power and hunted down Trotsky and all his dissenters.  In book and film, Ralph becomes a heroic Trotskyist figure who opposes Jack and his brutal Stalinists.Both book and film provide a disturbing look at the triumph of totalitarism.

I would expect that in a Hollywood film, but not one made by the British! We see the completely unmarked body of a boy who was jabbed and beaten to death by many attackers.

And I'm sorry, I don't mean to bash the entire movie, but what's with piggy's death? In the book they made it dramatic and symbolic (when he dies the last symbol of order is shattered before the boy' eyes (conch)). In the movie it was almost funny. Not because of the fact that he dies, but the way they kill him. Is it me or did that rock bounce off his head? I just think it would have been more powerful if all they showed the giant rock were Piggy stood. Obviously he dies, there's no need to prove how badly done your movie was made.

It was a very attention drawing story with vivid imagery, a compelling descent into savage behavior with a strong lesson about values and ethics. I highly recommend the book to anyone.But here an immortal story has, amazingly enough, been made into a bad movie. It's as simple as that. I don't know about the simple movie viewer, but if you had just read the book, as I had, watching the movie would be complete torture.The book had eerie, colorful imagery that pulled in readers and compelling and disturbing scenes. Naturally, a movie adaption of a story on such an island in such a remote place begs for color and visual moods. However this movie was filmed in black and white which considerably dulls the intended atmosphere in several scenes. Too bad the '90s remake of Lord of the Flies completely sucked. It would have been a chance to make up for this flaw.The scenes are very poorly organized. Any tension, suspense, or compelling nature is lost because the screenplay and shots just don't flow well and the camera work is amateur and quite sloppy.And what really both amused and irritated me about this movie is the laughably poor acting from an inexperienced child cast. Yes it's true that they're only children, but there were and are films with good kid actors that could convincingly do character roles. The kids in this film are just embarrassing. They all sound like they're struggling to remember their lines or are trying to follow character directions but not quite knowing what to do. The cast is completely unconvincing, and their performance contributes greatly into making this the bad movie that it is (though it's not completely their fault as the direction and technical work is every bit as shameful and amateur, and besides the child cast from the '90s remake was every bit as horrible if not worse). By the way, you'll notice that the voices of some of the older kid actors change tone getting deeper and higher pitched in alternate scenes (this is particularly noticeable with Ralph). Yet another sign of poor organization and little thought into this movie.Overall, a lousy film, but definitely the right choice between the '60s and '90s version. If you're going to watch a movie adaption of William Golding's literary classic, this is the right version to watch as the '90s version is even worse, but the best choice would be to skip the movies altogether and just read the book. Go to your local bookstore, get the novel, turn to page one and get ready for one amazing trip.

I decided with the older version as it is the one whose snapshots came up while I was searching for the cover of my book to feature in my book review.The movie starts with a series of black and white pictures over sound. We deduce from them that it is set in England, that a war, probably a nuclear war, has started and that kids are being evacuated by plane. We hear a crash. The next scene, we see two kids on a beach and they wonder if there are any adults left. They start by getting everyone's name. They find a shell in the sea, that the young boy who is only referred to as Piggy, informs them is a conch. In order to have everyone gather, Ralph blows the conch and they decide who should be the leader. While Ralph is soon elected leader, another boy, Jack, who lives only to hunt the wild pigs on the island, soon threatens the power of both the conch and Ralph.The film is a quite good adaptation. It is very faithful to the text and apart from two scenes, I couldn't really see many differences.I was annoyed by a few things however. First of all, I felt the music and sounds weren't fitting the atmosphere. I also think the scenes that lead up to a sort of communal frenzy among the boys were so frantic they lost all sense of realism. It simply didn't seem to fit. Last but not least, I think the acting was fairly poor. I understand that an ensemble cast of young boys is not the easiest thing to manage but a lot of overacting ensued which took away from the film's credibility.The movie, which was extensively cut, was a good telling of the book and I felt they did pick out the key scenes from it in order to form a compact, yet linear and understandable tale. When seeing a movie from a book you have read, it tends to be a great disappointment when some of your favorite scenes go missing or when you feel the movie isn't understandable as a whole because of some involvements cleared out in the book, but that didn't happen here.In many ways it reminded me of the French film La guerre des boutons (1962) but if had to recommend only one, I'd go with the French one. I think, even though Lord of the Flies' addresses far more serious cultural criticism than the, mostly, comedic relief of its French counterpart, the acting of the ensemble cast is far better in La guerre des boutons.I liked Faithful to the book.

So I had to be content with, years later, watching the film. It turns out to be something very fascinating; very naturalistic (the film was mostly improvised by its young cast) and with breathtaking black and white cinematography. It's the classic story of a bunch of kids marooned on a deserted island with nothing but their wits and most barbaric instincts as young men (emphasis on *men*, British no less), and what it is to be apart, or decidedly not part, of a herd. And while I wasn't completely blown away by the production, I could see the definite admiration for the source.As for the film, Peter Brook crafted something unique in that he got a bunch of kid actors, pretty much all of them first timers and non-professionals, and made them about as believable as can be possible in a drama. Aside from some other examples like Shoeshine or Stand by Me (though the latter is more comedy/drama), Lord of the Flies showcases these young talents so much in a raw style, and often to heartbreaking and almost anthropological effect, that you can't take your eyes away from it. It's by now means flawless and occasionally suffers from its improvised expression of narrative, but the positive results are so strong it's kind of a sleeper must-see of the 1960s, at least in British cinema.

He's a big name in theater! Well, I'd be lying if I claimed that I didn't, throughout watching this film, often thought to myself Mr. Brook, I do believe you should have stayed in your own field. I do now, though, acknowledge his talent. The film opens with a bold and unusual(as far as I know; I haven't seen too many films of this period, so it may, in actuality be common practice of the era) choice of narrating events, which I found refreshing and surprisingly effective(though if the less-than-pleased grunts I heard from around are any indication, I was in the minority). The film has an interesting plot, though that may be more indicative of William Golding's insight than that of Brook... I'd have to read the novel itself to determine. Before I proceed; I've heard that there is a colorized and re-cut version of this film... the version I saw is the original, black and white (and apparently, less expertly cut, judging from the opinions of those who have seen both; I wouldn't exactly claim that those are terribly educated opinions, though). The pacing is all over the place. In some instances, the film is intense(at times, without really 'moving'... an impressive effect that is not easily achieved), and at others, it doesn't move, well, at all, really. The acting is, as could be expected by a cast of teenage boys, not all stellar. I would suggest that at least some of the roles were cast with more focus on the actor looking like the character described in the book than actual acting talent. The cinematography is at times magnificent, with some breathtaking visuals... and at times dreary and dull, with lazily composed shots to cover the action. I found myself marveling at how many angles seemed to be missing... scenes where one would expect the camera to cut to a reaction shot or a closeup, and it instead stays... and stays. Not moving from it's current motif. The editing seems as if there was too little time or enthusiasm to do it properly. Several shots are cut into before the action starts and out of too long after it's over. Also, I found myself looking at the screen all too often, not being able to make out what on Earth was going on or what I was supposed to be looking at. I recognized the same in my fellow viewers. It may be supposed to build atmosphere and create mood, but all it achieves is confusing the viewer. The cut I saw was no more than 76 minutes long, but it certainly felt like a lot more. Now, with all that said, all that negativity... the film was actually not too bad. The point it makes is excellent, and I found myself more involved in it than I thought I would be. I truly cared about these young, English lads... even though they did have a tendency to be a bit full of themselves. Some of them handed in far better performances than what is normally expected from such young(and no-name) actors... reminiscent of Tami Stronach of The Neverending Story. Near the end, one of the boys delivers a stare so unsettling that it's a bad bet to claim that it won't send a chill down your back the first time you see it. Though the production values and film-making qualities are somewhat dubious, this film is worth watching for any person who considers himself an open-minded individual. I urge you to read the book instead(since I am almost certain that it's better; to get this great work in its purest form, the way the creator intended it), but if you refuse to or are unable to, pick this over the colorized version(since that apparently loses tone and important character traits) and definitely over the '90 version, since, just reading some of the quotes, ruins at least one incredibly strong scene of this. I most insist that you watch without reading the plot outline or hear what it's about from anyone(unless you have already have); I did. I watched this having no real idea of what it was about, and I don't even want to consider how little an effect it would have had on me if I had preconceptions about the story.

I read some rave reviews about this movie by movie critics, some claiming that it's a brilliant classic, others claiming that the actors were good, and most agreed that this is better than the 1990 remake. There are good things and bad things about this movie. It is a low budget movie, so don't expect great effects. This movie was made back when special effects didn't matter, so I don't really care as much about the effects. The directing is pretty good, the direction in this movie has better flow than the 1990 remake. In the opening scene to this movie, it shows pictures of the kids at their school, and it shows pictures of the plane as it crashes. This is a very low budget approach to the scene, but surprisingly, it is more effective than the opening to the 1990 version. Another plus side to this movie is that the character development is good, and this movie doesn't make a whole lot of changes to the book. The only actor in this movie who was good was the kid who played Ralph. He was better than the kid who played Ralph in the 1990 version. While the kid who plays Piggy is exactly the way I imagined the character in the book, I thought his acting was rather poor. The antagonist in the story, Jack, isn't acted very well by the actor in this movie. In this movie, he is more of just an upper class, arrogant, and not intimidating character. In the 1990 version, the kid who played Jack was good, and was more of an intimidating character. In that movie he was more of a troubled kid, in this one he is just an arrogant person who is fairly normal otherwise. It just seems more likely for a troubled kid to degenerate to savagery than it does for an arrogant upper class kid. The score is pretty good in this movie, but the score in the 1990 version is more riveting and intense. While the direction is pretty good, the qualities of the film are very poor. The picture is blurry, the editing isn't very good, and the soundtrack isn't in the best condition. The ending scene in this movie is done better than the 1990 version. In this movie, the death of Piggy is more shocking and since it isn't shown on screen, it isn't fake looking. The following scenes are also pretty suspenseful. The surprise ending is much better than the rushed ending in the 1990 version. In this movie, you get more time to feel the characters' emotions at the end.All in all, this was an okay movie. It follows the book very well, but the poor qualities really bring the movie down, at times it is barely watchable due to the poor qualities. At least the direction is pretty good. Only watch this if you have read the book. I thought the 1990 version was okay, but this wasn't a whole lot better.

On top of that they're coming off 15 years of noir films, and they still don't know to fill the dynamic range. The imagery is drab.

He is also described, repeatedly, as being 'fair'. Fair hair, blue eyes, pale skin. James Aubrey is short and skinny with brown hair and eyes. He seems, in fact, as short as some of the littluns. He has no status over the tribe. He is also much shorter than Jack, creating a difference of status between them. Jack looks like he could beat the hell out of Ralph with ease. They are meant to be two equal-but-opposite forces butting against each other, with the decision of power being made by the sway of the masses (littluns).The biggest problem with this movie, however, is the lack of time. The events of this movie could have easily taken place over 2 or 3 days, a week at the most. The long hair, sunburn and tan, and general omnipresent filth are all symbolic of their descent into savagery. Sure in the movie, their clothes get ripped and they get smudged with well-placed dirt but this only serves to further break the illusion as you raise an eyebrow at their perfect hair, fabulous teeth and unblemished skin.I think, though, that the time is ripe for another stab at this deep and introspective story, perhaps with a director who can fully grasp the meaning of this story.

Despite the lack of effects the movie could have been filmed to show certain scenes with a lot more effectiveness.  The acting in this film was, for the most part, absolutely brutal.  They're just kids and can't be expected to pull off Oscar performances but most lines were given with no emotion and bad timing.  It's not a wonder that only two of the boys in this movie went on to greater things (Ralph and Robert).  The direction could also have been much better.  Even from small things that could have been edited out later or redone in a matter of two seconds. ((one of the first scenes when the choir is reciting their names, every persons timing was horribly off and the first boy Henry kept glancing at the camera and couldn't even focus enough on the one line he was given to deliver it with any effectiveness)) It is the directors job to notice these small things and convince actors to avoid them.  Especially when they're dealing with children.In William Golding's defense this story was incredible.  I suggest reading the book and not watching the movie because there is much more to the book than there is top the movie.  If you've seen the movie but never read the book, I suggest taking the time to read it, whether you liked the movie or not.

Lord of the Flies is an intirely emotional and mentally deep book, one full of simbalism that just couldnt transfer well on screen. Ex. The book explains just what the 'Lord of the Flies' is, whereas the movie doesnt. In the book this explanation comes in a semi-hallucination to my favourite character in the book, Simon. Simon is a very deep character, as is Ralph and even Jack. Without this character development, the boys transition into madness is muddled and unclear. Where is Simons conversation with the pig and the fly? Why do we see the parachuter before the boys realize what it is? In the book, we know about as much as they do when they first see it, hightening the suspense. Why does Ralph not talk to the sailor at the end like it was intended? Where are the shelters in the movie? Keep this wonderful novel on paper. It doesnt belong on the screen. And if you are going to make it into a movie, find some better actors.

Lord of the Flies documents just such a situation. The movie, adapted from William Golding's novel of the same name, is about a plane full of young British school boys that crash lands on an island. The pilot of the plane dies and the thirty something boys are left to fend for themselves and make their own rules. As lines are drawn and tribes are created and divided, chaos descends. This story delves into the dark and undisciplined, essentially animal side of the human mind. It's extremely dark and indeed frightening to watch the depths that unattended children sink to when they lose all control and authority.The story William Golding created is an absolute incredible one that goes so much farther into the psyche of the adolescent than most dare to go. Unfortunately the film adaptation of this epic tale does not even begin to do the source material justice. It is a poorly executed attempt at bringing Golding's novel to a new medium. My biggest complaint with this film would have to be the acting. The direction is somewhat shoddy and the sound mixing is particularly frustrating (even though I read all the sound had to be overdubbed because the ocean drowned out everything while filming) but the acting is the biggest issue. The child actors all seem to regurgitate their lines, giving the film a stale feel without any substance to lines which are meant to be harrowing and dramatic. During the entire first and second act the acting is tense and feels very forced, whilst the actors are being completely unenthusiastic. In a film about children losing control and going absolutely mad with power and freedom, the acting should be much more restless and I kept thinking these kids needed to be more hyperactive and significantly less subdued.Leading into the final act there is a very significant and very obvious shift in tone. The story turns from an innocent one about lost children, to a terrifying psychological study. It was here that the highlights of the film came from. There were some scenes that delivered in a dark and cynical way, and for that I can appreciate the effort only slightly more. After this dark turn the film started to improve at points, but then would seem to drop back down to that subdued level of lackluster acting. By the end of the film I felt robbed of what could have been a great adaptation of a fantastic story. But by the ending, which was still well done, I realized that the character relationships were still underdeveloped, as well as the underlying themes of the story. They weren't absent from the story, but they could have gone much further.All the right elements are present in Lord of the Flies but they are all very underdeveloped and the film does not achieve its full potential. Poor acting and a lack of enthusiasm hurt an extremely well crafted psychological experience that had so much potential. A story like this could be amazing if done right, but when it isn't done right, everything goes horribly wrong. I was left very disappointed by this film adaptation.

My older and advanced students read this book and then present me with a summary of it together with personal comments; this happens almost every year. Thus I think I may say that I am thoroughly acquainted with the story and its development in all aspects.I cannot help thinking that some previous reviewers of this film have either not read the novel, or were not paying enough attention whilst watching the film. However, there is one highly glaring omission in Peter Brook's film a hog's head was clamped onto a tall stick, but was never referred to in spoken words as being `the Lord of the Flies'. The fact that flies were then seen (and heard) buzzing around the hog's head can only lead one to presume that the visual message was considered enough in itself. There are other omissions and some strange changes to the novel. Firstly that the aeroplane carrying the kids ploughed into the jungle and did not flop down into the sea as in the film.So it was very nice - excuse me - seeing the boys at the beginning in nice white shirts and chorus gowns. Thankfully, as the boys grew into the surrounding jungle back-cloth, their attire changed ominously but correctly.Helped along by Raymond Leppard's `Kyrie' for boys' voices, and otherwise on instruments as well as tuned drums solo, conspiring with some spookyish black-and-white photography, the narrative goes through Golding's novel almost to the letter, thus making the small deviations and certain omissions all the more puzzling. This is by no means a criticism but an observation, as all `poetic license' of any kind has no hard and fast rules. However, I do think that 10 to 15 minutes added to the film might well have put right those niggling points.The boys were mostly between about 9 and 14 years of age, thus it is rather difficult, to say the least, to exact highly professional performances from these young actors. We get what could and should be expected and be grateful for it. My one grumble is that `Piggy' in the novel is cast as a little uncouth, with unpolished English, poor pronunciation and a fair amount of slang which does not have much to do with Camberley, Surrey, U.K. To my dismay, in the film `Piggy' seems to have received plentiful elocution practice. Tut, tut. My other little grumble is that in 1963 I think British film-makers could have run to a few more pennies and given us the visual glory of the beauty of wild Puerto Rican shores in full colour. I will concede that the use of colour might have diminished tension (or spookiness) in the telling of the story. `The Lord of The Flies' narrates, somewhat moralistically laden in the end, how a group of war-time British boys with inherited stiff-upper-lip social backgrounds can  quickly slide into savagery as supposed power of one kind or another takes a hold on them. Is it not the same in big power politics today on a globalised level? Yes ....... I can just see it Golding's hunters are the terrorist groups fighting against Bush, Blair, Putin, Aznar and so on. But, no my imagination is running away with me.An acceptable film but not very recommendable perhaps; I will not bother with the 1990 version. I will just lean back in my revolving chair, imitating an Oxford College don and recommend the novel.

A lot of crucial points in the pages of William Golding's masterpiece novel are lost here, while others that are based on them are retained, thus the story flows very jerkily. The musical score is almost non-existent, and while it works when applied, there are some scenes that could really have benefited from good scoring that are given in complete silence. The script is, for the most part, almost verbatum from the novel, which is nice, but some new scenes are added that are totally pointless, and moments of dialogue crucial to the original story are foolishly skipped. Peter Brooks, however, does do a nice job of directing the movie. His camera angles are good and he gets genuine drama out of some scenes, and establishes the island quite well before the real story starts. The collection of still images the opening credits are projected over to a children's choir is also pleasantly eerie. The one thing that destroys this movie totally, though, is the kids' performances. The acting is so BAD it's surreal, robbing all the scenes of any energy. It doesn't totally kill the movie, but comes close. Brooks' direction alone has to carry the movie, and it staggers a bit under the burden. I don't think Golding would have been proud of this.

The opening scenes are especially bizarre and non-real. Are we to believe that an airplane loaded with British schoolkids crash lands on an island, and that not one of the kids looks the least bit mussed afterwards? The film opens with flashcards depicting the flight and crash, and then children start appearing from all parts of the island, clean as soap, as though they are not even aware of what happened, really. Wouldn't they have all come from the same place, the crashsite? Wouldn't they be torn up with many dead or nearly so? The rest of the film has an odd, surrealistic flavor as well, but nothing tops the way these British schoolkids seem to have been transported to the island, Star-Trek style. So, obviously, these kids are to be taken as symbols of humanity, not real peoole.Because of the film's surrealistic symbolism, I found some of its themes to have an immature viewpoint and to represent a disturbing, socially-bigoted view. Certainly in `the real world', the boys' descent into savagery would have more to do with their being spoiled rich kids without any real values or discipline than it would any kind of inevitable devolution in to primitivism. The tribal societies they emulate with their painted bodies and chants were not chaotic bands of louts and idiots, as the boys in the movie become. Now, granted, the visual impact of the film would be greatly diminished with out this primitive look, but equating this kind of look with evil and chaos is just stupid. It would have been much more compelling (thematically, if not visually) if the kids were not made to look and act like extras in an old Tarzan movie, OR if the good voice-of-reason kids weren't the only ones not to do so. The symbolism of rules and order equal western clothing styles vs dressing in clothes appropriate to the climate equal savagery, chaos and evil is inescapable. And dumb. They could have all acted and dressed British and we still could have had the same conflicts. If the film had been more realistically portrayed, then all this could be written off to kids who actually were imitating the racist images seen in the movies, not knowing any better. But it is obvious that the filmmakers intended everything and every one in this movie to be symbolic rather than realistic. So the imitation savagery must also be taken as symbolic and purposeful.

As well as this, the change in social interaction and life must be taken into account when considering how good this film is. You could probably get a copy of Lord of the Flies and read it, following every line spoken in the film exactly, but ultimately, that is not how to adapt a book for a film. Certainly, this adaption is much better than the 1990s version which was changed so much it was hardly an adaption at all, but creative changes must be made when transfering a book to the big screen. With 'The Lord of the Rings' this was done very well (NB certain scenes had to be cut not for creative reasons, but because of length reasons) but here there do not seem to have been many.The acting in this film is one of the worst criticisms. The children don't seem to understand what they are saying most of the time and don't seem to really know what is meant to be going on. You can blatantly see that shots have been done so that the children have to say as little as possible in each shot and has been done in an as orderly fashion as possible (eg when the boys are all giving their names they were obviously just told what their character's names were and then told to say them when the camera was on them. They even seem to find this difficult.). Sometimes they seem to just reading a card which has been placed conveniently off screen (eg when Percival etc can't remember his telephone number you can see him look at the bottom left of the screen to read his lines off a card). The lines are said monotonously and overall, the acting is terribly wooden.Next, the sound. When I was watching the film, it was blatantly obvious that the soundtrack had been dubbed in ADR. Sometimes you can see a character's mouth moving completely out of sync with their line, and sometimes their mouths don't seem to be moving at all (eg the first time we see Piggy). I found out after watching it that the sound was dubbed in post-production as I had thought. This reflects badly on the film - sometimes you can even hear when the recording starts and stops.Next, the budget. I don't know how much of a budget this film had, but it certainly wasn't enough. The overall look of the film seems as though it was edited as quickly as possible and not really thought out, showing how amateurly it was made. This was a British film, so the filmmakers can be forgiven a bit, but the film should not have been made with such a small amount of money.Despite all this, the film still manages to capture William Golding's intentions in the novel, unlike the 1990s one, and is enjoyable to watch even with the terrible technical hindrances. CONCLUSION If you want a high-tech, more modern version with no brain, watch the 1990s version, if you want a low-tech, low-budget, faithful version, watch this and if you are studying the book, watch this.
