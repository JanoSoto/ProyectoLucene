[{"Title":"Holy Housewife","Date":"20 February 2000","Score":"25 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Dogma showed that throwing darts at the Roman Catholic Church isn't hard to do. Similarly,  Stigmata created villains within the Church hierarchy with relative ease.  The hard part is making some sense of what motivates priests and nuns to carry on in spite of this undeserved negativism.  That's what makes The Third Miracle a joy to watch - a film that goes beyond stereotypes and biases to try to find answers.  There is something in this film that believers and non-believers can take away from even though The Third Miracle has decidedly taken a strong stand about matters of faith.  The linking of a wayward postulator, Father Frank, searching to legitimize a common woman for sainthood, with his own personal search for God is very effective.  Equally so is how the film shows the powerful role of secularism in the lives of men we call 'holy' (can it be any more obvious than the Bishop's mud bath?).  A stroke of trickery at the end doesn't spoil the way this film invites us to consider faith as truly an all-or-nothing proposition.  Certainly for Father Frank, the invitation to faith and to his own priesthood was based on a shaky bargain with God to spare the life of his father. For Roxane, the daughter of Helen O'Reagan, the decision to exclude God was equally as capricious - that God would take her mother away from her just because she had to do God's work.  For Archbishop Werner, the God he defends and the God he internalizes are two different beings - one who is all knowing and all powerful, the other who cannot see beyond things black and white.  The Third Miracle, then, is not just about canonizing a dead woman, a holy housewife, but about how these three living players interact and struggle with each other to arrive at their own faith.  This interaction is played out so well due to brilliant performances by Anne Heche, Ed Harris, and Armin Mueller-Stahl.  Miracles strengthen one's faith but the visible miracles are more likely to move those who need a sign to believe.  The irony of Father Frank is that he was instructed to disprove the very extraordinary acts of faith which he desperately needed to save his own spiritual life.  It took him two hours, the length of this film, to find his miracle.  The Third Miracle leaves us with a similar challenge, how long will it take for us to find that same miracle, that same faith.

This is one of the lesser-known movies that is definitely worth watching.  I was curious about it, mostly to see Ed Harris' performance.  I've always loved Harris in everything he does, so I knew I could at least look forward to seeing a great actor at work.  I have to say, this is one of his best performances.  It's subtle and powerful, and he doesn't play his typecasted villainous role.  This is a very different role for him, and one to remember.  The premise and overall plot is intriguing, and Holland (I'm not gonna even bother spelling out the first name) does a fine job at keeping the suspense.  It brings out great morals about Catholic faith, and faith in God just in general.  And it proves that even people of priesthood can screw up, falter to temptation, but can still be summoned by God.  Harris' character is a washed-up alcoholic, but God still sent him to investigate this alleged saint.  Harris was even questioning his own faith, which made it even more interesting. The Third Miracle is one of the overlooked films of 1999, and I definitely suggest you give it a viewing.  You won't be disappointed.My score  7 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"Don't be late for this movie&#133;","Date":"4 February 2000","Score":"18 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Yes, don't be late for this movie. What you see at the beginning sequence sets up the rest of the movie. It's the backbone of the plot. You have to take this film in whole. There are flashbacks. There are video playbacks within the film. They are subtle link backs - rather like navigating on the Web, and this Web is one of Ed Harris' character, who is struggling within himself - his mind, heart and soul, wrestling out of his own doubting web of gray matter. It's clicking on memories, description of things happened before, back to the present, rewind to the beginning imageries&#133; It's challenging that way - it is a dramatic delivery of a story about humanity, faith, living and loving.  The saint to be or not to be is portrayed by Barbara Sukowa - for me, she can very well be a saint after her passionate performance of 1986 Rosa Luxemberg, followed with her role in 1991 Voyager played opposite Sam Shepard and Julie Delpy. The reason of one leaving a loved one dear to one's heart, like her daughter (Anne Heche) when she was 16, hearkens to Julianne Moore's character in 1999 The End of the Affair where she left someone (Ralph Fiennes) she loved wholeheartedly, because of a silent promise to God due to God's answer to one's prayer. This is a similar dilemma Father Frank Shore (Ed Harris) is actually coping with. Before The Third Miracle, I didn't realize there's a whole Roman Catholic Church vocabulary unto its own, e.g., postulator, beatify, canonize, saint - these words were described in the dictionary within the breadth of  Roman Catholic Church. Miracle or not, it's up to the believer. How one worships is also to one's own design. The film, on the surface, may feel rather like a Hollywood drama, yet it is not your usual topic. There are gritty scenes and challenging questions raised against one's attitude to faith. Ed Harris, Anne Heche, Armin Mueller-Stahl are a combination of actors worth watching. Whatever and however your feelings are about the subject of this film, it ultimately celebrates life. Miraculously for 1999, DOGMA is an imaginative, creative piece on the Roman Catholic Church. Writer-director Kevin Smith (1994 Clerks, 1996 Chasing Amy) delivered an ensemble cast with Linda Fiorentino (John Dahl's 1994 The Last Seduction) as the virginal divine connection in the center of it all; Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as the pair of angels in distress; Chris Tucker as the thirteenth apostle; and other colorful characters on this blessed adventure of a satirical religious journey. It's fun. You can tell the actors all have an enjoyable time delivering this fantasy piece!Along the lines of miracles and controversies, 1995 GOSPA (means Our Lady in Croatian) is a film about a reportedly true event in Medjugorje, where six children believed they saw the Virgin Mary in 1981, and millions of pilgrims have visited the site since then. It follows the struggle of the parish priest (Martin Sheen) who defended the six children; it becomes more of a political drama with evolving prison and courtroom scenes. Not your usual box office fare.Also remotely reminded me of the Schwarzenegger's 1999 End of days, where explosive devilish special effects treatment were used in the course of the redemption of a young woman (Robin Tunney), while The Third Miracle provides a more thought provoking film in following the course of a young girl's (Maria) salvation, and even a glimpse into what a Vatican tribunal might have been like. The film is full of details and they came at a subtly non-stop pace, yet director Agnieszka Holland is not thrusting anything at you, rather, the film kind of grows on you after you leave the cinema. If you want something different, try this film - go see it with an open mind.

However, it has now become my favourite movie for one reason. As a man of faith, I have had to endure years of Hollywood trivializing or sensationalizing most aspects of faith and religion. It seems to be the one subject with which they can find no degree of comfort or reconciliation. The Third Miracle, however, is a luminous study in how several characters learn to deal with their own faith, and yet it never tries to advocate any of those as right or wrong. It even avoids trying to be too specific about just how the struggle is resolved for each person. In the end there is a sense that they are all just a little further down the road. And that is, to me, exactly what faith is all about.It wouldn't matter if the religion involved were something other than Christian (spedifically Catholic). This could have been a story about Jews, Baha'is, Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, or Zoroastrians. Within the context of each religion is the matter of how each believer learns and lives his faith. It is a personal struggle, a mystical relationship that draws each toward his Creator. The events portrayed in the film may seem to some to be fantastic or surreal, but faith is also each of those. Miracles are intended for those who witness them, and they are simply what happens when a higher law than the one we thought immutable comes into play. One can't prove a miracle to another any more than the other can disprove it.The two most interesting characters are those portrayed by Ed Harris and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Each has had profound experiences with both faith and religion, and come to starkly differing conclusions. And yet each man's dedication to his convictions is compelling. Harris' scene in the confessional booth is a heart-wrenching example of how impotent one can feel when in moments of doubt. Mueller-Stahl later gives a chilling demonstration of the intolerance that can arise when one denies the promptings of the spirit Caprice of God! I would say it to His face if He were here now!As for the rest of the movie, I will leave that to those who write in very clever and articulate language about character and plot development, cinematography, and such. I will say that I found no serious flaws in it, from the small amount I have learned of such things from reading many such reviews. I'm not sure why such illusory fare as Pulp Fiction becomes legendary, while a faithful rendering of human realities like The Third Miracle becomes a marginalized curiosity. Do we derive more inspiration from caricatures than from characterizations?

There's no sex, violence, sci-fi, or spectacular special effects in this one, folks.  Just plain old good acting by the leads and supporting characters, excellent and evocative photography, and a first-rate musical score that adds to the overall enjoyment of the film.

Directed by Agnieszka Holland and starring two-time Academy Award nominee Ed Harris, this 2003 film opens in a flophouse in the late 1970's. Father Frank Shore (Harris), a priest who is faltering in his faith and who has stepped away from the church, eats his meals in soup kitchens, and does what he can to help those less fortunate with whom he lives. A professional postulator ( a person who investigates claims of sainthood) Father Frank is being summoned back to authenticate the miracles of a recently deceased immigrant woman named Helen O'Regan (Barbara Sukowa) who spent her last years living in a convent as a layperson. Loved by all, she is credited with healing a young girl, and every November (the month she died) the statue weeps blood. Known as the miracle killer it was just such an assignment that destroyed the faith of an entire community, and has caused his own crisis of faith. Doubt may be healthy for a layperson, but in a priest it is a certain sign of apostasy according to Archbishop Werner (Armin Muellar-Stahl) who is sent by Rome to undermine his findings in front of a church tribunal. The hierarchy of the Catholic Church is not well portrayed in this film. The Archbishop's rigid determination that no saint could possibly came out of America, especially one as ordinary as wife and mother Helen O'Regan, counterbalances the Bishop who talks politics over golf, spends long afternoons being massaged and mud-packed, and invites colleagues to high-profile gatherings based solely on their ability to converse wittily over cocktails. Even the poor Chicago parish where the possible-saint-to-be lived is tarnished, as the local priest proudly displays rows of scarlet electric pushbutton candles for parishioners to light when they offer a prayer. Doubt and cynicism live side-by-side in Father Frank, and neither this, nor his meeting with O'Regan's feisty, atheist daughter Roxanna (Anne Heche) surprises him. Angry that the mother who abandoned her for the church is even being considered for sainthood, Roxanna invites the priest to dance on her mother's grave in an odd, yet surprisingly sexual scene. Chemistry notwithstanding, the priest is saved from further faltering by a rainy night miracle to which he is a firsthand witness. Reclaiming his collar along with his faith, he returns to the church and argues his case before the tribunal. Several other twists and turns add to the courtroom-like suspense-some we see coming and others we do not-and contribute to an enjoyable two hours. The only question that remains is What exactly is the third miracle to which the title points? Two are arguably attributed to the candidate for sainthood, but what of the third? On the face of it, it may simply be Father Frank's return to faith, but I would argue that the miracle is ours. Rather than calling us to believe the miracles of this saint of the people who live in the ordinary world, I suggest it calls us to look for the miracles in our own ordinary lives. In the last scene of the movie we see the first two miracles the restoration of Father Frank Shore and the joyous motherhood of Roxanna. The third miracle is not named because it can't be named; it is different for us all. It exists in the ordinariness of our lives, and it is up to us to find it.

The stories of both movies revolve around a doubting, questioning priest whose job it is to investigate and either certify or debunk purported instances of divine intervention.  However, `The Third Miracle,' because it treats the material within the context of a serious drama, emerges as by far the more interesting of the two films. Ed Harris, in a solid performance, stars as the man whose job it is to verify these ostensible miracles but who, like most movie priests it seems, has come to question his faith and to doubt his own worthiness to even carry out the task.  Anne Heche delivers her customary fine performance as the cynical daughter of the woman whose potential candidacy for canonization sets the plot in motion.  Indeed, the film is at its most intriguing when it allows us to get a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes nuts-and-bolts machinations that the church uses in determining the viability of sainthood.  We watch as the Catholic hierarchy treads the fine line between faith in supernatural intervention and the more worldly concerns of pragmatic politics.  We see the petty jealousies, character attacks and power struggles that reduce even the most ethereal of ventures to the level of basic human frailty.  In many ways, this broader conflict reflects the one which rages on a more intimate, personal level within the tortured psyche of Harris' character himself.   It is his internal struggle between doubt and faith, between the physical and the spiritual, between strength and weakness that manages to keep the many strands of the plot together even when the film, at times, verges a bit on the banal and the tedious.  Happily, too, the film does not succumb to the fashionable secular cynicism that is all too common in films today.  `The Third Miracle' manages to explore the many-sided complexity of this issue without trashing the spiritual nature of the topic in the process. `The Third Miracle' is not by any stretch a great film, but it succeeds in exploring a tricky subject without insulting the intelligence of the audience along the way.  After `Stigmata,' we offer our most humble thanks for that.

Both focus on Catholic priests who check out reports of the supernatural.  Both are plagued with doubts about the faith, and as a result drink too much.  Their superiors are either corrupt or evil-or both.  During the course of their investigations, the priests team up with women who are not believers. They fall in love.  At the end the priests and women are somewhat redeemed.The difference in the films is what the two priests are after.   In `Stigmata' it is a force that is killing the woman.  In `Third' the priest (played by Ed Harris) investigates the credentials of candidates for sainthood.  If he can confirm that the candidate is responsible for three miracles, he can recommend that the person be made a saint.Harris feels guilty because a recent investigation has led to an entire community losing its faith.  As a result, he has become known as `the miracle killer.'  But in the course of `The Third Miracle's' plot, which focuses on Harris' investigation of a simple woman in 1979 Chicago, he regains his faith. Convinced that there have indeed been three miracles, Harris must then argue his case before a church tribunal.  A skeptical archbishop who is convinced that such a common American woman should not be granted sainthood opposes him.The climax of the film is predictable-the average moviegoer should be able to see it soon after the archbishop is introduced.  Unfortunately, the movie tacks on an ambiguous ending that leaves us wondering if the priest and woman's redemption aren't the true miracles.  The film raises a final question Has Ed Harris ever given a bad performance, or even had a bad scene?  He is assisted here by two fine other actors, Anne Heche and Armin Mueller-Stahl.

It looks like filmmakers believe that people will not be able to take serious portrayals of faith which are not balanced by a hefty amount of cynicism and inner struggle. Of course inner struggle is a big part of faith, but there ARE people and priests out there who just go about the business of believing in God and working for the the good of humankind without excessive torment and without having to battle a blighted hierarchy. It has become a given that representations of faith must either be corny and preachy or extremely secularized. It's as if filmmakers had figured that there are only two audiences for religious themes the feel-good believers who watch the various angels TV shows and the questioning skeptics who need heavy-duty realism. That's not true and not accurate. Religion is a complex business, but this complexity can be shown more subtly than by secularizing the priesthood to the point of disfiguring its reality and purpose.Same goes for miracles. What is it with blood-crying statues of the Virgin anyway? If I remember correctly there was one in Stigmata as well (and in Central Station?). And, come on, there must be a less hokey way to deal with miracles than by having a little girl walk into a church all covered in blood, then turn out a junkie, then resurrect from the dead for the whole shamed bunch of priests to see. It was all very dramatic and very corny. Myself, I preferred the heavy-handed spookiness of Stigmata at least the force of the divine was truly palpable and religion was not reduced to someone's psychological drama.I wish someone gave Anna Heche a role in which her incredible sexiness and charisma were used a bit better than to seduce old guys and priests.

What the film and possibly Catholic dogmatics err on is their failure to acknowledge the very scriptural definition of faith (Hebrews 111). Faith should not at all be based on signs and miracles, even though Jesus and God often employed visible miracles. However, miracles are employed not to bring faith, but to authenticate divinity before unbelievers. Faith only comes from hearing God's Word, sharing in the Eucarist and baptism. The film fails grossly in separating the true meaning of faith and miracles.Aside from erroneous Christian dogmatics, the film and research team failed to get their facts straight on the events that occurred in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia in 1944. Banska Bystrica was controlled only by the Slovak Army throughout 1944. The German Army only occupied Banska Bystrica in October 1944 after they crushed the Slovak National Uprising whose headquarters was in Banska Bystrica. The German Air Force bombed Banska Bystrica between September and October 1944. The Americans never bombed Banska Bystrica in 1944. In fact, the Americans flew in to an airport just south of Banska Bystrica (Tri Duby) several B-17 fortresses with war matériel in support of the insurgent Slovak Army during the Slovak National Uprising in September and October 1944. On August 20, 1944, the 15th USAF flew bombing missions over Banska Bystrica to bomb an oil refinery at Dubová just 20 km NE of Banska Bystrica, but never dropped bombs on Banska Bystrica. (See http//www.muzeumsnp.sk/WWW-USA-nov%E1/USA-GB-oprava.htm for greater detail.) Banska Bystrica was finally liberated from Nazi control in March 1945, and if there was any bombing of Banska Bystrica in 1945, it was performed by the Soviet Air Force.

Miracles in the Catholic Church have long been debated as pure fiction vs. acts of God. As a Catholic, or anyone of religious faith, your greatest inner struggle is your faith.  Do you believe in a higher diety or not?Each character in this film experiences conflict with their faith and they work to resolve this throughout the film.  I think that this is the most authentic part of the film and certainly the most rewarding.  To that end, including the incredible story of several miracles and how they tie together the characters and the story delivers what I believe to be one of the better Catholic based films I've seen.Enjoy this story.

I found it both moving and lacking, but I'd recommend it to those who are wondering about the mysteries of life and the human spirit. I have no idea how the Catholic Church and its membership would feel about it.On a purely human level, the movie is about doubt Ed Harris is Father Frank Shore, an American priest asked by his Bishop (Charles Haid) to investigate Helen (Barbara Sukowa) an American candidate for sainthood. Along the way, Frank uncovers miraculous deeds, encounters his own doubts about his calling, and eventually seems to believe in miracles.Other main characters have their doubts too the prospective saint's non-Catholic daughter Roxane (Anne Heche in one of her best performances to date), the stuffy official Vatican investigator Cardinal Werner (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and Maria (Caterina Scorsone), the troubled subject of one of the questionable miracles.Good prerequisites for this film might be Martin Scorsese's film version of Nikos Kazantzakis' The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and most of Federico Fellini's films, in particular 8 1/2 (1963) and Juliet of the Spirits (1965).Holland lets the Church off lightly compared to Fellini, but she does successfully underscore the pomposity of the cardinals and bishops in their big cars and sparkling vestments. This leads to an essential question about her reasoning and the meaning of film's ending, but I won't give that away I'll leave that for you to judge.

His work draws scorn from his contemporaries and has earned him the title  The Miracle Killer.  Due in part to the inherent nature of the job and tragedies in his personal life Frank is embroiled in a crisis of faith, which only grows deeper when he is given a new assignment.  Complicating matters is the fact that this one appears to be the genuine article, and not what the Church wants to hear.Unlike other recent religious movies that dealt (badly) with secret cabals within the Catholic Church and evil in apocalyptic proportions (Stigmata, End of Days), or were iconoclastic satirical exposes (Dogma) religion is almost a cursory concern in Miracle. Character development is the saving grace if you will of this film.  Shying away from special effects and dramatic action shots, the film focuses on the personal struggles that most people go through regardless of the source, be it personal development, career goals or faith.  The performances are reflective of this.Harris, known for his stoic, macho (read stale) characters took a risk with this role as a confused, vulnerable priest. It proved to be a wise decision, as he delivers what is arguably the finest performance of his career. Charles Haid is repugnant as a narcissistic Bishop, more concerned with cocktail parties and schmoozing with politicians, than he is with spiritual purity.  Armin Mueller-Stahl is riveting as the Devil's advocate, a snobbish Archbishop who feels that the only legitimate qualification for sainthood is martyrdom and unknowingly holds the key to a mystery.  The one weak link is Heche's character, an incidental hanger-on, but this is the fault of poor writing, rather than a bad performance.Very well done.

The acting was alright, cinematography was nice as it had some footage that had to look like WWII footage, and there was an underlying plot of the priest finding his faith. Plus it managed to not bag on the Catholic church too much. I'm not Catholic, but I don't really enjoy the films that are too polar on the church.So anyhow, if they could just cut off the last 2 minutes of the film it would have been great.

The need to have proof to revitalize faith lost is a common dilemma for most of us. Frank Moore, a disillusioned priest, is on a mission to prove something to himself as he investigates a marble statue crying tears of blood in the courtyard of a convent. Ed Harris does a great job portraying a down and out Catholic priest who is uncertain and wavering in his deep seeded religious values and beliefs as he investigates consideration for the sainthood of Helen O'Regan. Frank is attracted to Helen's daughter, Roxanne (Anne Heche), which further complicates or enhanced his life, depending on your point of view. I found the glimpse into the hierarchy of Catholicism enlightening, as well. If you enjoy a spiritual quest for answers to prove the unseen, with a dash of love intertwined, you will enjoy the movie. I had a different idea for the ending but other than that, I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to others.

It looks like filmakers believe that people will not be able to take serious portrayals of faith which are not balanced by a hefty amount of cynicism and inner struggle. Of course inner struggle is a big part of faith, but there ARE people and priests out there who just go about the business of believing in God and working for the the good of humankind without excessive torment and without having to battle a blighted hierarchy. It has become a given that representations of faith must either be corny and preachy or extremely secularized. It's as if filmmakers had figured that there are only two audiences for religious themes the feel-good believers who watch the various angels TV shows and the questioning skeptics who need heavy-duty realism. That's not true and not accurate. Religion is a complex business, but this complexity can be shown more subtly than by secularizing the priesthood to the point of disfiguring its reality and purpose.Same goes for miracles. What is it with blood-crying statues of the Virgin anyway? If I remember correctly there was one in Stigmata as well (and in Central Station?). And, come on, there must be a less hokey way to deal with miracles than by having a little girl walk into a church all covered in blood, then turn out a junkie, then resurrect from the dead for the whole shamed bunch of priests to see. It was all very dramatic and very corny. Myself, I preferred the heavy-handed spookiness of Stigmata at least the force of the divine was truly palpable and religion was not reduced to someone's psychological drama.I wish someone gave Anna Heche a role in which her incredible sexiness and charisma were used a bit better than to seduce old guys and priests. That was bit of a useless side-tracking, wasn't it? Or was it a selling technique? Either way, we could have done without it.

From the early sequence in Slovakia which literally reduced me to tears, to its untidy and appropriate ending, this film refused to take the easy path for its characters and its audience, giving us an unflinching view of faith and loss, and the place those occupy in our lives. Performances by Harris and Heche are outstanding, as are the myriad of smaller roles.  Mueller-Stahl is underused but always riveting; Charles Haid reaches perfection in inhabiting his role.The title refers to the third miracle required to elevate a prospective saint from the status of beautified (The Blessed So-and-So) to full sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.  The film follows the path of a priest as he first attempts to debunk, then becomes advocate for, the beatification and sainthood for a Chicago woman.  In the process, he has to face up to his own many failings, the imperfect reasons for his own entry into the priesthood, and his lingering drive to break his own vows. Miracles are relative, yet must stand up to acidic tests.  Harris finds his own version of miraculous through his exploration of the life of the potential saint, and takes the filmgoing audience along.You'll have trouble finding this movie in the theaters; it should be out on video soon, one hopes, and I recommend it highly.

Only Hollywood would make a movie about a middle aged foul mouth priest and then cast a lesbian as his flame.  The assault on religion is non-stop with the Catholic hierarchy living lavishly and wearing gold chains and big medallions and using foul language.  Maybe they were trying to identify with the rap culture?  What ever they were trying it didn't work with me.  If Ed's character wasn't bad enough Heche's character is also angry and brooding too, I guess it's tough to have a mother who was a Saint. My advice is to skip this turkey. "}]
