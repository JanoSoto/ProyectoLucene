We were ashamed at some points in the movie associating ourselves with the former fellow countrymen. But the showed THE TRUTH! All of the things shown used to happen in real life.Robin Williams was brilliant. He spoke Russian with almost no accent, which was amazing!I am from the Soviet Union so I know what I'm talking about. Nearly all of the rest of the movies are not more than a joke when it concerns reflecting life in Russia or Soviet Union. Even in the Air Force One (with Harrison Ford!) I was laughing like crazy when they showed supposedly Russian Prison.So, all of you lucky to be born in freedom, please see this movie and you maybe will start thinking why you are so lucky and how exciting but difficult is to be an immigrant!

After seeing him in so many great films like Insomnia and One Hour Photo and watching his numerous hilarious talk show appearances, I've become even more curious about checking out the movies on his filmography that I have yet to see.  Well, this is more than just a Robin Williams vehicle.  Paul Mazursky cleverly combines comedy and drama, and expresses some good morals.  He accurately portrays an immigrant's journey to America, and how he/she expects that America is a beautiful place where everyone can run free without any set limitations.  It starts out as a fish-out-of-water comedy in which Russian immigrant Williams (who decides he wants to become an American citizen) explores the oddities of New York City and revels in its ambience, no matter how rough the neighborhoods are, no matter how many wackos are running around.  Then he slowly learns that freedom has a price.  America may be a free country, but that doesn't stop him from getting mugged and having his upstairs neighbors constantly complain about him playing his saxophone.  One thing that impressed me was rather than have a bunch of American actors don Russian accents, Mazursky actually has the actors speaking Russian to each other.  Now, there are certain movies like Schindler's List and K-19  The Widowmaker in which we do see American actors speaking English and putting on foreign accents and still prove to be good movies, but it's always more engaging to see characters from a certain country speaking their native language.  I mean, what if Russia were to make a movie set in America, where all the American characters were speaking Russian in American accents?  How goofy would that look?  I'm guessing that Williams was the only American actor in the cast, and the rest are actual Russians.  I don't speak Russian, so I can't tell whether or not Williams was actually speaking Russian, but it looked convincing to me.  But since mainstream American audiences have grown to hate reading subtitles, you probably won't see a movie like this released nationwide.  Robin Williams gives a terrific performance, totally disappearing into character.  I was actually convinced he was a foreigner, as he speaks just like a Russian immigrant, in broken English, not articulating his words one bit.  There was no sign of Robin Williams the Comedian in his character.  Whenever he gets a laugh, he gets a laugh as Vladimir and not as Robin.  Besides, this is one of his more serious roles and he never really plays it for laughs.  Maria Conchita Alonso still sounds Cuban, as her Italian character, but she still gives a fine performance.  Since I haven't seen her in any recent movies, it's nice to see her pretty face again.  She was like the Salma Hayek of the 80's.  Williams and Alonso have a good on-screen chemistry.  The friendship between Williams and his African-American friend, who goes as far as letting him move in with his family, is very touching.  Working as a security guard at Bloomingdale's and seeing Williams wreaking havoc around the store, he starts out hating his guts.  Before you know it, they're best buddies.  The most touching scene is the one in which Williams leaves a jazz club, depressed after being told by a well-known jazz musician that he needs practice.  He decides to throw his saxophone away and forget about being a musician altogether.  His friend relates to his problem and gives him plenty of encouragement in pursuing his dream of playing the saxophone, as they get drunk and laugh their heads off.  The movie stresses the outburst of immigrants in New York City, which is a melting pot society.  Almost every character Williams comes in contact with is either a foreigner or a minority.  Strange but undoubtedly true, if you were to examine the streets of New York.  It's not unlikely to walk across a whole city block, where not one person speaks English.  The movie has no real plot structure, as it is mainly character-driven.  The comedy is subtle, and arises naturally.  My favorite quote from the film is when Williams says, I bought my first pair of American shoes.  They were made in Italy.  That is a sample of the kind of humor in this film.  I definitely suggest people check out this oldie-but-a-goodie.

Noteworthy performances by Maria Conchita Alonso (as his eventual girlfriend) and Cleavant Derricks (as the Bloomingdales security guard who takes an immediate liking to Vladimir). Mazursky walks the line of schmaltz at times but doesn't cross over. Especially evident in a well done scene when Vladimir finds out about the death of his beloved grandfather.

(It's very much a product of its Reagan time, right down to the casual homophobia.) Robin Williams, for once not twinkling too hard or overworking his virtuosity or adorableness, is an Everyman Russian who unexpectedly defects in Bloomingdale's and goes on to live the immigrant experience, suffering urban indignities and romantic angst along the way. His worklife is a little easier, his economic situation a little less treacherous, and the people he meets a little nicer than they would be in real life.

Seeing it again, I found it quite prescient if less intriguing and funny. Robin Williams plays a Muscovite who visits the Big Apple as part of a cultural troupe. On a visit to Bloomingdales, he suddenly decides to defect (a very spin is made on this term!). The rest of the film deals with his attempts to settle in the US.Obviously given the great political changes in the USSR and Eastern Europe since the film was released, it has aged noticeably. However, it is not entirely without merit. The big plus is obviously Robin Williams. He was and is a great actor and seems to have put in great effort on his Russian and spoken English accents. Notice the way he says Mister. The hot, hot, hot Maria Conchita Gonzalez (Miss Venezuela 1971) plays an Italian immigrant and the love interest. The overall bent of the film is liberal - African-American families are especially realistically and positively portrayed. The central lesson of the film is that the transition from a Communist to a Capitalist mentality is not easy and the adjustment can bring great joy and sorrow. That is a very valid lesson in the largest context of the later collapse of the USSR and the painful transition ex-Soviet states are still going through.

He's really become quite a film star and is especially good playing against-type as a criminal or simply as a wacko (see One Hour Photo?)Anway, this was an early Robin Williams film in which he plays a Russian musician defecting to the United States. He (Vladamir Ivanoff) first hides out in a big store in New York City before being taken in as an immigrant by a black guy (can you say PC?) Williams does an outstanding job speaking Russian, by the way, as opposed to most English-speaking actors.There really isn't much of a plot here, just slices of life, if you will, some of it with the usual Liberal promiscuous (i.e. I'm a liberated woman and if I stay the night, don't misinterpret that I want to get involved with you, the Italian tells the Russian. I can think of a few more accurate descriptions that the word liberated.)All in all, despite the premise and talents of Williams, this was only so-so. It kind of runs out of steam halfway through and it's hard to maintain interest in the final 40 percent of it. Actually, I like Williams better when he plays more serious roles like this although I'm not sure if he himself was ready to play it straight this early in his career. He's just too tempted in this film to produce comedy. He's a talented and very strange guy; this film reflects that.

It doesn't hurt that this movie stars a young bearded Robin Williams with heart (and Russian soul!) and a really cute and occasionally nude young Maria Conchita Alonso (a real-life Venezuelan immigrant) full of Italian passion and an ambitious independent spirit.Only in the early 1980s could blue jeans from Bloomies, velvety white toilet paper, supermarket coffee, studio apartments, hot-dog stands, cab-driving jobs, and U.S. citizenship ceremonies be portrayed as symbols -- indeed even weapons -- of democratic capitalism in a world still governed from Stettin on the Baltic to Varna on the Black Sea by the totalitarian evil against which President Ronald Reagan called a crusade two years earlier in his famous 1982 Evil Empire speech to the House of Commons.The political content of the movie is startlingly black-and-white by today's standards of multiculturalism and moral relativism when many academics defend dictatorships' sovereign right to exist, and so the offhand manner with which at every turn the film's writers Paul Mazursky and Leon Capetanos deliver praise to political liberty, capitalism and America's unique cultural acceptance of immigrants dedicated to the pursuit of happiness is remarkable. While the way in which their praises are conveyed may from time-to-time seem a little cheesy, sentimental or dated, their profound significance is not diminished.Exactly because capitalism is an economic system as well as a social system, Robin William's character is portrayed as a Russian seeking a remedy for his literal physical hunger and basic financial requirements of life that socialism fails to satisfy. His Russian friend, played wonderfully by Elya Baskin, suffers from socialism's other often dramatized evil -- its humiliating and paralyzing effect on an individual's creative mind and psychology. Perhaps it is precisely because the film's focus is on Williams' character that Moscow on the Hudson at times comes off as exhibiting the over-the-top 1980s commercialism that made it popular then and a little startling in today's Greener age.Russophiles can get a kick out of some of the Russia scenes. Highlights include the drab Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoi Boulevard including full-figured women in polyester; sour old babushkas enforcing their place in line; and shoe vendors pushing the wrong sizes. They might also find some treatment of Soviet atrocities like sending war protesters to mental institutions, or neighbors reporting dissidents to the KGB a bit trite, but not inaccurate. Such horrors are no less relevant in Putin's Russia of today (October 2006), where the most recent contract killing of independent politicians, businessmen and intellectuals is journalist Anna Politkovskaya.While I've focused on the political content, this movie is not primarily a political piece, but a love story; and not primarily a love story, but a romance of personal initiative -- of immigrants who choose to reject the oppressive circumstances they left behind and to seize the chance to pursue their material survival and eventually, individual happiness. The aims of the film are high, maybe even too high at times for this light film to be able to achieve fully; but it is definitely touching and fairly deals with the array of issues every immigrant faces on a variety of levels. I personally found the love relationship between Williams and Alonso to be touchingly realistic at times; and the individualistic focus of this film to be refreshing, as well as a shocking reminder of how inappropriately self-conscious the American media has become in publicly asserting the universal truth and appeal of its core principles freedom and capitalism.

If you are an American watching it, there is no place like home.Vladimir Ivanoff (Robin Williams) is a saxophonist with a Russian circus in the days of the bad old Soviet Union. Tired of waiting in line for toilet paper and bribing a snooping KGB agent (Saveli Kramarov) with shoes that won't fit him anyway, Vlad has a catharsis somewhere between Estee Lauder and Pierre Cardin in a Manhattan Bloomie's and decides to defect. America means freedom, but will it mean happiness, too?Have you ever felt like just not talking? asks Vlad's new girlfriend Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso).In Russia that's permanent way of life, answers Vlad.Moscow On The Hudson is another of those superlative Paul Mazursky films that was a hit in its day and has been ignored since. Mazursky's films play off the contrast between the fantastic and everyday reality. The early scenes, of Vlad in Moscow, feature a chilly, brittle environment of little humor, with Williams scoring points not for being a cut-up but for being so muted and beaten-down. It's so gray it feels at times like a Bergman film, with welcome clownish notes struck not by Williams but Elya Baskin as his friend whose dream becomes Vlad's reality.Then we get the trip to New York, a wondrous place where you can do anything in this country if you want but everybody I meet is from somewhere else. A suddenly vibrant color scheme is married to a sometimes goofy sense of humor, yet a sense of menace and despair hangs over all. There are goofy scenes, moments of humor that don't quite work, yet Williams' performance remains balanced and straightforwardly character-driven throughout. No shtick here.Most of the time, the film is too busy celebrating the idea of America as the land of immigrants. Mazursky isn't making Yankee Doodle Dandy here. He may be celebrating the United States, but not blindly. Our first shot of New York is of Abraham Lincoln, on a billboard wearing over-sized earphones with the legend Not all stereophones are created equal. Not all people, either. The black family who adopts Vlad early on makes do with a breakfast of Cocoa Puffs and no work in sight.But Mazursky keeps things merry, with an eye toward opportunity and strength through diversity. Even when he leans too far in search of a shot, it still brings a chill, like when group of immigrants recite their oath of American allegiance or an old Asian guy lifts a sparkler up to the Empire State Building in celebration of the Fourth of July.It was easy to love America in films of the 1940s and 1950s, but by 1984 you needed to work a little harder at it. Moscow On The Hudson doesn't soft-soap Vladimir's struggle, or sell it as a political act (I'm not political are the first words out of his mouth after his defection is made clear). But it celebrates the idea of America with a vibrancy and courage few films have shown since, and more interestingly, does so from what Roger Ebert noted was a liberal point of view. Liberal, but with a strong capitalist touch, back in the day when the two ideas were still compatible.Maybe they still are. You can still watch this on Amazon.com, can't you?

This is minor, though.Nest, there are the toilet paper line scenes, which are totally lame. We would use napkins or newspaper as toilet paper in SU, but we didn't have the long lines do buy toilet paper as the movie claims to project.Then there's a reference to Russian women having a mustache, which is totally ridiculous. Another piece of retarded cold-war American propaganda. Anyone who's been to the SU or Russia knows that Russian women are 10, 20, no 100 times hotter than their American counterparts (over 50% of which are statistically obese to say the least). Not to mention American women's attitude that has resulted in American men being the #1 men by country to marry foreign women. Enough said.In general, each country, the SU and the US, had positives and negatives about living there. But life in the SU was superior after all (I left SU only after it broke up in 1991). People in the SU had far more of the one precious resource that Americans could only dream of having (and still do) TIME. People in the SU had a roof over their head, food, and other basic necessities of life, while at the same time having a ton of free time, including time to pursue their dreams and hobbies. That is why the arts (ballet, literature, etc.) were so developed in the SU compared to the US people actually had time on their hands to pursue those interests and hobbies. The US was, and still is, a bunch of debt slaves that live thinking how to make enough money to pay the next set of their bills, and have no time for real life.Not to mention that American kids grew up (and do even more so now) inside, seeing nothing but virtual reality, playing computer games, etc., while we in the SU were free to play out in the street all day long without being worried about drugs, psychos, kidnappers, etc. At age 10, I could take a train to a different city to go to a market to buy parts for building a personal computer, for instance. Good luck doing that in the U.S. which doesn't even have a transportation system to this day. And I never heard about drugs until the SU broke up. Ultimately, no society is perfect, but a good part of this movie is just a bunch of cheap propaganda. Of course, some people would defect from the SU, but so did people from the States (look up Dean Reed, for instance).I liked the line I have not had a job for 8 years. Welcome to the USA! Sounds like things have not progressed much in the USA since 1984 when this movie was made....Anyway, travel the world, people, and draw your own conclusions before you buy the bullsh!t that your government feeds you. Goes the same for both Russia and the U.S., as well as any other country... If you think of watching this flick, opt for Goodwill Hunting instead, even if it would be a re-run for you.

President Ronald Reagan reheated the Cold War in his 1982 Evil Empire speech and suddenly free capitalism and collective communism waged war once again on cinema screens.Unsurprisingly, Hudson begins in Russia, director Paul Mazursky treating us to a twenty minute sequence which stresses that the great socialist paradise is really a nightmarish hellhole. Cold and harsh, Russians wait hours in line for toilet paper, are constantly under surveillance and always fearful. Robin Williams, who plays a member of a Russian travelling circus on tour in the US, thus decides to defect, literally seduced by the capitalist decadence of a Bloomingdale's department store.From here on virtually every character in the film is an ethnic minority or immigrant, Mazursky stressing that in America everyone is from somewhere else. Heck, even the immigration officers are immigrants, every creed and race given the chance to make something of themselves.Mazursky then rolls out the cultural icons. Blue jeans, coffee mugs, soft toilet paper, department stores, yellow cabs, hot dog stands, baseball games, limousines etc are celebrated and dished out like ideological weapons, symbols of cultural superiority. Robin Williams himself finds it easy to make friends and overcome obstacles in this fantasy word. Black men, Italians, Greeks and Latinos cheerfully assist him along the way and he has no trouble jumping from one job to the next. The film pauses at times to say that crime, racism and greed are rampant in America, and takes aim at the cavalier attitude most American's have towards their freedom, but for the most part, the way Williams smoothly assimilates into American life is a bit too unbelievable. There are no struggles, no racial tensions, everything is a bit too easy.And yet, I think Mazursky does try to insert a bittersweet, almost subversive tone to the film. Williams remains an anonymous bum at the end of the film, a mere street musician, and his closest friend, an African American, loses his job and kids. America may be the land of opportunity, but only for those it doesn't crush.7.9/10 &#x96; Quirky, despite its black and white politics. Worth one viewing.

The initial response I had was to treat it as a mildly amusing comedy revolving around an eclectic set of characters that didn't really seem to have much of a point in the end. But there's more going on here than meets the eye at first. The whole movie revolves around the concept of freedom, and how freedom is defined. Produced at the height of the Cold War, I took from this movie a statement that freedom is about much more than a political system.The first part of the movie deals with Vladimir Ivanoff's (Robin Williams) life in the Soviet Union. Protesters are arrested, Ivanoff is threatened by the KGB for no reason other than that he has an eccentric grandfather and people line up for blocks to buy toilet paper or shoes that don't fit. From what I've read, that's probably an accurate description of life in the USSR. But it isn't as bleak as it seems. Ivanoff has a family he loves, a girlfriend who loves him and wants to get married, and he can pursue his passion of saxophone playing with the Circus. Most important - this guy doesn't want to defect, and he tries to convince his best friend Anatoly (Elya Baskin) not to defect either, when the Circus visits New York City.The second part of the movie is set in New York. On the spur of the moment, Vladimir defects - at Bloomingdale's. He hadn't planned to. It just happened. Asked by an FBI agent why he was defecting, he answered simply freedom. And now we begin to learn about freedom. Vladimir tries to make connections. His best friend becomes a black store security guard named Lionel (Cleavant Derricks). Lionel's family parallels Vladimir's (right down to the eccentric grandfather), but it isn't Vladimir's family. Lucia (Maria Conchita Alonso) becomes Vladimir's love interest, but she doesn't want to commit. He can't even play the sax. He waits tables, drives a taxi, becomes a street hawker - all ultimately unsatisfying. For me the most poignant part of the film comes in a coffee shop, in a discussion among the various immigrants. They misquote the Declaration of Independence, and say that the inalienable rights of human beings are life, liberty and happiness. But Thomas Jefferson didn't say that. He said the pursuit of happiness. Here is where I really began to see the film as a sort of satire about freedom. To be politically free without having one's basic human needs met is ultimately not freedom.It's an interesting statement. Unfortunately, the movie itself is not that interesting. That's the basic problem. It has the potential to be powerful, but just doesn't rise to that potential. Why? Too much emphasis was put on the immigrant nature of New York City, for one thing. That became - to me - something of a running joke, and I started wondering what the next accent would be rather than following the story. For a movie that tries to make a powerful statement (and a gutsy one, given the political climate of the time) it just came across as too light - the sort of movie that you feel you could miss twenty minutes of and step right back into without trouble. The nude scene with Maria Conchita Alonso in the bathtub with Robin Williams (Williams hands roving all over her body) also struck me as in bad taste and exploitative - totally unnecessary to the story.Anyway, not bad. Once I took the time to think about it I decided to move it up a couple of notches in my estimation. 6/10. Unfortunately, it could have been so much better.

The film's technicals are generally very good, therefore.The biggest problem with the film is that it has too much sentimentality, that is, too much feeling that seems artificial or even fake (mawkish is a good though not often used word - it comes from the same root it seems as maggot! and denotes something that makes one nauseous!).  I don't want to exaggerate negatively here.  I said first that the movie is quite good and I mean it.

We laughed a couple of times and may have cheered for the Ivan character at liberating choice to defect, but the overall movie was pretty shallow and didn't explore it's liberally slanted memes.The purpose of this movie is predicated on a joke that gets repeated over and over again. The joke is - let's have Robin Williams imitate a Russian immigrant and have him walk around a wild city like New York and see what happens. Yes, I admit that premise would be more interesting than if he took a trip to rural Texas or Wyoming. New York, with all of its outlandish and colorful sights may provoke much wonder in a wide eyed soul who is inexperienced to such stimuli. So the movie supplants itself in this premise and exploits to unrealistic and sometimes silly parodies. I thought Moscow on the Hudson worked better as a parody, but when it tried to overreach as a meaningful commentary on American life and morals, it lost its momentum and fell flat.Also, a movie increases its appeal and intrigue when it inserts a beautiful and sexy love interest. Maria Conchita Alonso fulfills that promise. I thought their meet cute was okay and I was willing to go along for that ride in Ivan's American experience, but she is sort of treated as an object of desire who is romantic, but also capable of stereotypical tantrums and resistance. There is also an unflattering scene with Williams and Alonso in a bathtub where he is rubbing his hands over her breasts and expressing his prurient desires. Unfortunately, he ends up looking like a lecherous pervert. Both of them look tawdry in that scene and it also ruined his likability for his character who is supposed to come off as a sweet soul. The friendship between Ivan and his Black American friend looks forced as well. Mazursky inaccurately portrays the Black American family as being a family of goodwill and munificence. I know there are some political undertones to Moscow on the Hudson and they are really offensive inasmuch as they allow us to make up our own mind. there are a few funny moments that I will not mention. This is not a great movie by any means. I would never consider it a cornerstone masterpiece of Cultural studies. It is simply a comedy that makes a feeble attempt to be serious.

Could it work? You wouldn't think so but the splendid little flick Moscow on the Hudson makes it work. Robin Williams stars as a Russian saxophone player named Vladimir Ivanoff. Vladimir and the circus troupe he performs with take a trip to the United States in to perform. While there, Vladimir makes the spontaneous decision to defect while in Bloomingdale's. He manages to get away with it and is left in the states. There he makes friends, looks for work, and learns why America is the greatest country in the world. The film doesn't come without its cheese, but there's something so charming and lovable about the film that I thoroughly enjoyed it.First thing's first, Robin Williams is as good as ever in this flick. He sports an impressive Russian accent throughout the film and about a quarter of his dialogue is actually in Russian, a language you would think he was already fluent in with how well he spoke it. Plus, the character of Vladimir Ivanoff is wonderfully lovable and it's a joy to watch his character progress and mature. Moscow on the Hudson at first starts out with the goofy and confused foreigner who doesn't know what he's doing, but it slowly moves away from that cliché as it makes Vladimir into a real character, rather than a gimmick. He is perfectly believable and goes through a progression that I can buy into. The film deals with the overwhelming nature of America for a foreigner, and it hits on some great points that go along with these ideas. Watching as Vladimir copes with the bustling New York City life is entertaining as well as touching and charming. We feel all of his excitement, anxiety, and even pain as he struggles with such a drastic change in lifestyles.Now, as interesting as the character development of this film might be, it is served with a heaping side of fresh cheese. There are some undeniably silly moments of the film where it begins to take itself a little too seriously and goes too much of a clichéd route to get a point across. I understand that one of the central themes of this film is America as the greatest country in the world, despite all of the problems, but this point is driven a little too exaggerated at points. There is one particularly eye-roll worthy scene on the fourth of July when Vladimir and other immigrants are quoting the Declaration of Independence and other parts of the Constitution inside a café, showing how we can all come together and put aside our differences. I found this to be a little too obvious and melodramatic and wished the film would have toned down some of the cliché in spots. However, it didn't keep me from really enjoying the majority of this film.I didn't have a clue what to expect going into Moscow on the Hudson, but I'm very glad I watched it. I probably wouldn't sit through it again, as I got everything I needed out of one viewing. This is a fun film with great characters and fantastic performances. It delivers a sincere, albeit clichéd, message that makes the film a little more than just another silly foreigner in America film. Plus, putting this film in context makes it all the more important. This is a Cold War era film that really pushes a message of peace and love, and I give it undying respect for that. It shows that we can get along if we just try, while also exemplifying that America stands to be the nation of peace and acceptance. Whether that is true today is up in the air, but that's a whole different topic. The fact of the matter is, Moscow on the Hudson is a pleasant little film that is well worth a one time watch.

Of course now we know what a big star he became, and also his unfortunate death last year.Robin Williams is Russian musician Vladimir Ivanoff and most of the first part of the movie depicts how hard it was in Moscow in the early 1980s. When a performance troupe is in New York he takes the bold step of running off at a department store, chased by Russian officials, but he manages to secure refuge.The rest of the movie has him working hard to make his new home there, thus 'Moscow on the Hudson.' He first takes a job busing tables in a restaurant, just carrying dirty dishes back to the dishwasher. Eventually he takes jobs like clerk at a fast food counter, running a street hot dog cart, a limo driver ... until he is able to get a new saxophone and play good music gigs.The other running story is his attraction to pretty (actually Hispanic) Maria Conchita Alonso as Italian Lucia Lombardo, also making her way into this new land. It is on again, off again because she is not sure she wants to commit to a marriage relationship but in the end it seems they will.Good movie and Williams' Russian seems fairly authentic.

In what is probably his finest performance, Robin Williams plays Vladimir Ivanoff, a Russian saxophone player for the circus who defects while on tour in New York City (at a Bloomingdale's, no less). Even though there is some necessary character establishment in Russia, the movie is largely concerned with his experience as an immigrant and how he adjusts to life here in the United States. During the course of the movie, he meets a black man named Lionel, who is the first person to take him in, and an Italian immigrant named Lucy (Maria Conchita Alonso).What struck me the most about the film, other than the outstanding message, was the degree to which Robin Williams immersed himself in this role. When he was on screen, it was like I was watching an actual Russian saxophone player instead of him playing a character. As a side note, he actually did learn how to speak Russian and play the saxophone for this film. Beyond that, the movie just felt real in the sense that you could believe that an immigrant would conceivably go through many of the situations portrayed in the film. To many of them, there must be this whimsy and fantastical aura when viewed from afar, but things turn out to be quite different once thrust into it headfirst as Vladimir is. Among the things I really took out of the film is the sense of community that immigrants and minorities have, something which they bring from their own life experiences.There is also the central issue of not taking freedom for granted, as I'm sure many Americans born here would understand. Seeing as this film was made during, and in the context of, the Cold War, life was understandably difficult in countries with dictatorial regimes and the lure of America, a free country, was certainly a strong one and still is to this day. That, I feel, is what should be taken away after watching this film most of all. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should all treat each other with respect and appreciate the freedoms we enjoy.Looking at the film from other perspectives, the technical aspects of the film are all excellent, though not flashy. Paul Mazursky allows the drama to take center stage, and it benefits the film considerably. There was also a great score with a jazz tinge, which gave off a whimsical tone at first, but also conveyed a sense of longing. Acting-wise, of course Robin Williams gives an incredibly moving portrayal of a Russian immigrant, but Maria Conchita Alonso also does a great job as his fellow immigrant girlfriend. There are also a couple of small roles played by familiar faces (to me, at least). Overall, this is a remarkably tender and uplifting drama (with some laughs as well) that has a great message and Robin Williams' best performance. This is a film that deserves to be seen, so that we can all be reminded not to take our freedoms for granted.

It is quiet and episodic rather than exciting in any way. Vladimir, the Russian main character is completely different from any Russian I ever actually met (although it can work since all individuals are different). Convinced Marxists will hate its all too truthful criticism of communism. The 2  sex scenes break up the movie´s otherwise family friendly tone. However, in spite of these details, which can be both pluses and minuses depending on one´s point of view, Moscow on the Hudson is a great movie - possibly even the best movie ever made about the immigrant experience. ( I should know because I was an immigrant to the U.S. myself.) It is perhaps even mislabled as a comedy since its dramatic aspects outweigh its comedic ones. Its essential point seems to be that if you have a positive attitude, you can actually connect with the strange people in a strange land. However, its other major point is that no matter how well you adapt, the home where your roots are is still your home and you will miss it no matter how awful life there was. And if you are like Vladimir, you will also have to deal with an unstable mix of odd jobs, friends who never stay in one place too long, your new country´s street scum, arrogant morons from your motherland, and a significant other who will not fully commit to you. However, Vladimir realizes that this is not too high a price to pay for freedom to speak your mind, travel, and really shop around at Bloomingdale´s. He also winds up appreciating America´s wealth of many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, although the makers of this film were good enough to not bang the viewer over the head with this point. Rather, they present it as irreverently and matter of factly as Jim Jarmusch does in his best work. This all amounts to a movie that is very human (or humane) in a gentle way and rather realistic in its depiction of the less extreme varieties of human nature. Its low key approach is much better for expressing its points than the loads of melodrama which these kinds of movies usually have. The jazz music soundtrack is great too. Basically, if you´re sick of movies which are overblown and commercial, then you will especially appreciate this little gem.

He does a Russian very well here, and less crazy like the one he portrayed in Nine Months (though do not remember if he was Russian in that one). In this film he plays a musician in Russia who defects when he sees his friend taken by the KGB. Most of the film is him struggling to adjust to the United States way of life, which is vastly different than what he is used to and not all that it was advertised to be. It is funny at times, and it gets dramatic too. It is also a fairly long film for a comedy with a nearly two hour running time. Still, for the most part it is a funny and entertaining film and it does show a person the phenomenon known as culture shock as this person goes from a place where one has to wait in lines for everything to a place where there is no such restrictions. However, he also goes from a place where there is virtually no crime to a place that is fraught with it. So it kind of looks at things in many different ways.

I couldn't figure out its message. Was it, that life is terrible?  If so, why did the plot revolve around a Russian trying to adapt to life in America? Did the writer mean to say, that life here isn't easy? If so, he was stating a platitude. Did he mean to say, that though difficult, life here is better than in Russia?  You do not have to make a movie to prove it. I hated this one. It was not blatantly anti-Russian, but it did manage to make a crack about Russian women and their beards.  New York looks very alienating. An America that always needs reassurance about its uniqueness is in itself creepy.

Brief comic moments cannot outweigh this movie's constant oppressive atmosphere of a man who made a really bad life choice. Ever notice when a great comedian tries to play a serious role, it's usually maudlin and depressing? Somehow this movie reminds me of a Three Stooges short which is also very depressing. It's called Cash And Carry. The stooges, seeking shelter, find a shack in the middle of a junkyard, where they find empty tin cans, which they chuck out onto a huge pile of more empty cans. The shack's original occupant arrives - a young boy on crutches. And now the boy has no money, because his savings were hidden in an empty tin can. What a laugh riot (sarcasm).  "}]
