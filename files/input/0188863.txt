I saw the cover to this movie on the shelf since I'd starting working there, but judged it as kinetic crap by its horribly cheesy cover and name.  Yes, I judged this movie by its cover.  A customer about my age (25) then told me, unprovoked, that it was one of the funniest movies he had seen in years.  He said he was surprised by it and that I should check it out.  So, I did.Wow. I laughed and laughed and laughed.  I hadn't seen a movie that made me laugh that hard in a long time.  I actually couldn't wait to watch it again--this time with my girlfriend.  What a disaster. She absolutely hated it as much as I liked it.  We didn't even get through 45 minutes of it because she couldn't take it anymore.  Apparently, she thought it was one of the most un-funny movies she'd ever seen.  A negative funniness even, if that's possible.What does this tell us?This movie probably has a target audience of 18-30 year old males.Its rather dark view of the motives of women and, to that end, perceived psycho women, is fit-form to any man who's been with a woman that went too far, too fast--no matter how well the both of you got along. This movie is funny because of the powerlessness men feel in the face of a psycho woman--they can absolutely tear you apart and make everyone else think that it's your fault because you're the one who is falling apart.  As Yoda might say Dark, this movie is.French Stewart is completely impotent emotionally, physically, and mentally in this relationship.  If you're a man, you probably know this emotion all too well.  This movie capitalizes on that darkest of dark corners with which to view a woman in a relationship such as this.  In that sense, the movie is almost hyperbolic. Needless to say, it doesn't paint women in any sort of real favorable light.  No wonder my girlfriend hated it.So, guys, watch this movie, laugh you arse off--and don't show it to your girlfriend, she'll hate it.  I, on the other hand, watched it three more times.

She does everything to advance the relationship far beyond its years.  Of course, French does not want this, and it leads to some very dark and funny circumstances.  It uses sophisticated humor (i.e. how this affects his show and life overall) as well as completely low-brow humor (i.e. using farts as a weapon of revenge.)Script This movie has some very funny lines.  There are some lines that I almost choked on because I was not suspecting them.  I am sure that the next time I see this movie I will pick up some very quotable quotes.  Listen carefully to what they say, and you will be highly rewarded.Acting  This has some of the funniest and truest acting that I have ever seen.  I actually liked Bill Bellamy in his role.

We began using the term in connection to Green Acres and I Dream of Jeannie many years ago. A recent film examples of this would be Meet The Parents. If done properly, it can be funny (You, Me and Dupree). If the correct balance isn't struck, it's just frustrating and annoying (License to Wed).Love Stinks pushes it about as far as it can but it's resolution leaves you feeling satisfied. Bridgitte Wilson and French Stewart are both fantastic in this film. I'm truly amazed Wilson hasn't become a bigger star. The film begins with Seth and Chelsea meeting and the chemistry is immediate. We all know that euphoric feeling of early infatuation and it's captured perfectly in this film. I felt myself falling for Chelsea. But as a relationship matures those feelings fade and reality sets in. Sometimes, it isn't pretty. This film is about one of those times and it's truly hilarious. I'm sure most of us has dated someone who turned out to be a little looney. It's always nice to be able to laugh about it later.

But this movie had me in stitches and I often had to stop the movie as I would miss some line because I was laughing that hard. Yes, it's from a man's point of view, and yes it shows how some women can become raving lunatics to at least get to say, I was married. The plot is your basic boy-meets-girl story, though in this case we have a guy who is afraid of committing to any relationship, especially one he soon realizes is with a crazy person. But we also somewhat get to see the woman's point of view (there is a line she says early on in the movie that supports this view). The supporting cast worked well together and with the stars, and my only complaint is that they tried to make French Stewart look younger than he actually is. Overall, this movie has some of the funniest lines and scenes. Well worth the time, regardless of your age or gender.

It could be an 8 or a 9, if those are as good as the rest of what I saw.There are a million things going against this movie Tyra Banks, the fact that your main character is played by French Stewart, or just that it was being played on the TVGuide Network above the listings (that's one way to make letterboxing look more natural!).Without giving too much away, Stewart and a marriage-obsessed Wilson fall in love, move too fast, and then when the ring doesn't come, things get ugly in a comical way. Someone likened this to War of the Roses, but that movie was much darker, and was not nearly as playful. Plus, French Stewart really has some fantastic lines in this film; I frankly didn't think he had this in him. Both play their parts over-the-top, and that's what makes it work. Bill Bellamy is pretty solid as the best-friend, and Tyra Banks does her best Robin Givens in looking like a complete control-freak golddigger.I'd like to see the unedited version, to catch more of the angry commentary between the two combatants. And the good news is, it has an unbelievably happy ending.I'm not saying this ranks up there with a truly great film, but it's better than 90% of what's out there (that you probably didn't already see in the theatre).

Fans of French Stewart (3rd Rock From the Sun) will at least be entertained by his many one-liners. Unfortunately they are the only elements that work in this ill-advised movie. Like a lot of this mid-budget stuff, Love Stinks places its characters in ultra upscale surroundings and shows them living posh life styles; trying to fool viewers into believing it is a high-end production. But few moviegoers come from the richest portion of the 20- something demographic. Those living a less than swank lifestyle found viewer identification difficult; so the movie was quickly pulled from its theatrical distribution. Almost everyone else will have difficulty connecting with the film, which is basically the story of Seth's (Stewart) efforts to escape the grasp of the beautiful Chelsea, his materialistic and totally controlling interior decorator. Like this is a continuing problem for all of us! Chelsea is played by former beauty queen Bridgette Wilson (I Know What You Did Last Summer). Wilson is a better actress than she is given credit for people tend to dismiss her because of her non-acting background, and she is well suited to this type of bad girl role. But the script gives her no opportunity to add dimension to this character. At least most of us have seen this sort of mega-manipulative blonde at work. Desperate to marry, Chelsea gets the rich Seth in her sights, pressures him into a quick commitment, moves in and alters his priorities, then makes his life hell when he postpones the marriage. Most of this is told in an extended flashback, necessary for no reason other than to pad the running length so the movie will qualify as a feature. Of course Wilson and Stewart's acting gets a boost by relative comparison to the barely competent performances of the supporting cast, which includes talent challenged Tyra Banks and Tiffany Amber Thiesen. Steve Hytner (Kenny Bania from Seinfeld) also appears but adds little to the comic quality of the film. Love Stinks was written and directed by the guy who is blamed for creating Full House and Hangin' with Mr. Cooper. Ultimately, all you are left with are Stewart's occasional one-liners and Wilson's beauty. These are not enough to carry a whole feature film but are at least something for which to be thankful if you should be forced to actually view the entire film. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

After all, how could a worthwhile movie have gone under the radar for the last sixteen years? One top of that, I was going into it pretty blind, not knowing what to expect. For all I knew, it could pan out to be a cheesy chick flick or just a crappy movie all the way around.What I found instead was a hilarious 90's comedy that deserves to be far more well known. To be honest, the two lead cast members were folks I'd never heard of, but Tyra Banks plays a supporting role, along with Bill Bellamy (How to Be a Player) and Tiffany Amber Thiessen (Kelly from Saved By the Bell). All in all, though, the acting was great, and the story was just downright hilarious. The movie takes you on a journey of two never-been-married singles who begin a hot and steamy romance that quickly turns into an over the top case of clingy-girlfriend-syndrome. The story takes several turns along the way, most all of which are funny as can be. It's really hard to find a funnier take on codependence than you're going to see in this film.The humor is slapstick at times, and perhaps a tad bit sophomoric as well, but if you can handle a more mature take on immature humor then you'll be fine. I'd probably compare it to the vibe of the American Pie movies, or perhaps There's Something About Mary.

If that sounds like it will make you feel bad don't watch this, go have a glass of milk and some cookies instead.After seeing 'Love Stinks' I thought it probably hasn't got a very good rating here because of bashing from some ferocious feminists and other people who take themselves and things in general too seriously. However when I checked the ratings (which weren't very high as expected) I saw that women didn't in general give lower points than men which was a pleasant surprise. I guess there are more than few women who can take even a little provocative joke after all.The reason why I expected women to bash this movie is that it portrays many women as either rather bimbo-like (many of the side characters) or manipulative control freaks (especially the main character and also to some extent her woman friend).The main plot revolves around Chelsea and Seth who meet at a party. Chelsea is the bridesmaid and Seth is the.. umm.. 'groomsmaid' at their friends wedding (can't remember the real word at the moment, bad English, sorry, if u want to make a complaint please make it in finnish ;)). They get together and for a while things are OK. Then Chelsea decides she wants to get married and starts plotting on how to get what she wants. At first it seems to work but then Seth starts to get worried and jumps on the brakes. When he determinedly refuses to propose to her Chelsea goes slightly mad and tries to rip Seths life apart, which leads to quite a war between the two.Someone compared this to the 'War of Roses' and I also think the two are a bit similar. The War of Roses is a little better I think, Love Stinks is bit like War of Roses with a screwball twist.I gave this movie a rating of 6 due to it being a bit uneven (there are few moments that are in my opinion a bit boring or stupid). However I would recommend seeing this because the funny parts are quite funny. There's a farting in bed - scene for example that has been circling in the net (Feeder on fire! Incoming..! ;).

It is a guilty pleasure type movie, as it is awfully silly, but has some extremely funny parts in it. There are two things the film has that make it special. First, once it gets going (which takes about 15 minutes), it has pretty much continuous hilarious jokes that are unique and well-written. Second, it has a great surprise ending that makes it memorable. So, again, sure it's silly and a bit cliché at times, but it isn't for the Oscars. It's for watching something funny on a Wednesday night. It is probably a bit more of a guy movie than a girl movie, but not by much. Both sides get it pretty well in this one. If you appreciate humor, you will most certainly laugh and possibly very hard. So, if you feel a bit frisky, give it a try...you may just find a new favorite guilty pleasure.

I was not a fan of French Stewart or Bridgette Wilson before seeing Love Stinks but French Stewart and Bridgette Wilson are brilliantly matched in this obsessive comedy. I think most will agree that Bridgette is a beautiful, sexy woman. I had difficulty imagining French opposite her as a love interest but, surprisingly, French is perfect. I found myself repeatedly asking if this is really French Stewart because French Stewart just is not this sexy.

One of the things that is funny about this film is the way that Seth (French Stewart) gets trapped by Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson). Every step of the way, she dangles her goods in front of him, threatens to take them away, and then he caves in to her demands.  She manipulates this guy like her own personal hand puppet, and he's a big enough sucker to fall for all of it.  I found myself yelling at the screen, just say no, you spineless idiot!  Stewart pulls off his role perfectly, illustrating how so many guys are willing to just hand over their freedom of choice in exchange for a great piece of ass.  Seth get's suckered big time, and it's hard to feel sorry for him because he clearly has no guts whatsoever.  He's completely spineless.Once she decides that she's not going to get what she wants, Chelsea decides she'll get even instead.  She suddenly pulls back the mask, not even pretending to be anything but a selfish, vindictive and manipulative woman anymore.  Of course, this causes Seth to wake up and smell the coffee, and he begins an all out war with her, reminiscent of War of the Roses.Some of the gags they play on each other are funny in a slapstick kind of way.  On the flip side, the overall behavior of the main characters is despicable and loathsome.  For those who are easily offended by rude, nasty, dishonest and just plain evil behavior, this movie will be a total downer. If, on the other hand, you can appreciate the irony of the situations, and how both characters are driving each other mad in a uniquely male/female way of relating, then you'll probably appreciate the darkness of the humor.  I know I did.  But then I've had a couple of relationships with psycho chicks, so I can appreciate a film about one who gets her just desserts.In the end, Seth manipulates her into a trap of her own making that is a brilliant flip-side to the first part of the film.  In the end, both characters have driven themselves insane.  The funny thing is, after a second viewing of the film, it's easy to see that it is Seth who really screws himself over in the film by making bad choices.  Not only that, but Chelsea was likewise the one who screwed herself over by making her own series of bad choices.  These two characters have nobody to blame but their own stupid selves for their incredibly ironic situation.This film takes the problems of manipulative women and wimpy men to the extreme.  What made it funny for me was that it mirrors what is going on in American culture these days...and perhaps that's why some people seem to take it WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.  What I mean is that it shows a man that has become so feminized that he has given up all his power to the woman, and a woman who has become so masculinized that she actually enjoys pounding her man into the dirt.  If you can't take a joke that hits close to home, this film is not for you.

Stare at it in nervous horror -- well, that's another thing.  And well, yes, Bridgette Wilson as the she devil is a blonde beauty with an outstanding topside.  When she was in seduction mode she was sure hot -- although there was obvious big trouble brewing for anyone with half a brain.No woman should even begin to be able to do what this one does.  The point isn't how bad she is for doing it.  The point is she shouldn't be ABLE to do it.  Those who think that the central premise in this movie couldn't possible occur are simply wrong.  Admittedly, she'd probably have to kick the palimony suit off by not only lying that he promised to marry me, but also by claiming he had abused her -- but if so, without any proof whatsoever, she might well get a restraining order and him kicked out of his own house.  That should simply NOT be able to happen. For that not to be able to happen, no woman  should be able to kick a man she isn't married to out of his own house / apartment for any reason whatsoever, unless he is convicted of something and sent to jail.  But  the feminist movement and their male supporters, sometimes allied with the religious right, has in fact taken the domestic dispute laws and practices so far that that is not the case.  Hell, a married woman shouldn't be able to have a man kicked out of their joint house unless she can prove true and significant injury -- not just her fear of it (which can always be claimed), or scratches (e.g. from him trying to hold her hands so she won't keep slapping him, etc.).   But of course they can -- and claims by angry women are given great credence in the system these days -- regardless of whether there is an evident motive to lie or greatly exaggerate. That's how outrageous the American legal system has become towards men in domestic disputes with women.  Yes, I'm a lawyer (though not a domestic relations lawyer).The costs of defending against a palimony suit of the sort in the movie might have been somewhat exaggerated, but not all THAT much.  It could well be many tens of thousands of dollars, if not likely hundreds of thousands.  Possibly with him paying her costs all the way.  That should also not be.  In fact palimony suits should be summarily dismissed, unless perhaps he has made promises in writing.  Well, in some jurisdictions they are, but not all I think.All of this is deeply, outrageously wrong -- of course some states like California and New York, with many judges and juries of a certain world view, are vastly worse than others.  Some of it would be very easy to fix.  Simply make any claim of palimony only enforceable if the promise is in writing.  If obviously should have to be.  Hell, if we are going to require that promises to sell or buy real estate should have to be in writing to be enforceable, then certainly promises to marry should have to be -- if they are supposed to be enforceable.This movie actually has a serious social message at its core. But because it is pro male and anti-feminazi (how else can once describe Wilson and those that support her here) for a change, it has to be couched as humor, and deeply undercover.  Maybe things are starting to change and re-center.

The hate sex.I think however that the main reason I actually liked this movie was French Stewart.  I do not watch Third Rock from the Sun.  In fact, I rarely watch sitcoms in general.  But I LIKED French Stewart in this role.  The facial tics.  The unusally low voice.  The scrawny physique.  I want to see him in more movies.  It would be a shame if his potential big screen career was obliterated because of one movie that was poorly received.I also liked Bridgette Wilson as the ill tempered shrew.  She apparently had a good time making this movie because it shows.  I liked the chemistry between her and Stewart even if she is much more conventionally attractive than he is.A lot of people have been comparing this movie to War of the Roses, most understandably.  But I myself was reminded of The Crush.  Probably because both movies feature extremely beautiful women who are in fact raging psychopaths.I will concede that the script might have benefited from another rewrite.

As soon as it started, I thought **this has a low budget, B-movie feel to it; I'm probably going to hate it.**  Then despite my expectations, I started laughing, and rarely stopped 'til the end. ..ACTING French Stewart (3rd Rock From The Sun) somehow didn't seem quite suited for the part of Seth Winnick, an already successful (yet still up and coming???) TV sitcom writer.  Yet Stewart delivered his lines in his usual slightly off-beat manner and it was somehow hilarious.  Bridgette Wilson was great as Stewart's beautiful but temperamental girlfriend Chelsea, who is over-eager to find Mr. Right and turns neurotic and vengeful due to Stewart's hesitancy to tie the knot.Bill Bellamy and Tyra Banks are decent, if 2-dimensional, in their roles as newly married friends of the lead couple.  Tiffani-Amber Thiessen and Jason Bateman played very minor roles but added some face-recognition credibility to the film as the stars of Stewart's new hit sitcom.SUMMARY Love Stinks is a dark romantic comedy that reminded me (for reasons that are obvious when you see the film) of both There's Something About Mary and War of the Roses.  In my opinion, despite the low budget feel it had a surprisingly funny script and clever dialogue, along with some crass toilet humor and foul language.  But the way in which those elements were mixed seemed to be just right.  The plot is not a masterpiece of fiction, but did manage to avoid being predictable, despite the foreshadowing provided via the It all started when. . . narrative provided by Bill Bellamy's character.RECOMMENDATION  If you are a critic, or thinking like one when you watch it, then you might not like it at all.  If you are in the mood to just relax and enjoy it, then you should indeed find it to be very funny.  Maybe it helped that I just got out of a contentious relationship myself and I was in the mood for some vicarious revenge?  But for whatever reason, I liked it a lot and gave it an 8/10 rating.

Among other things, she throws a pair of $10,000 diamond earrings into the drink (don't worry; she still has them and was just screwing with him). Stewart isn't so mellow at this point.

This movie seems to be the classic loved it or hated it movie.I saw it years ago and found Bridgette Wilson gorgeous, French Stewart surprisingly appealing and the War of the Roses to be funny stuff. It is now making the cycle thru Showtime and I've watched it again.This time I found myself laughing out loud. The one-liners were great and the performances absolutely spot on. Bridgette (still gorgeous) is obsessed with getting married and is clearly overly manipulative, but I think has real affection for the guy. French Stewart, relaxed and likable as a leading man, is put off by some of her antics, but sees a pretty, sexy, fun woman in his life. She finally snaps and he sees the bad is way worst, so let the games begin!! The escalating battles are funny, the actors are terrific in their more and more crazy ways. I particularly liked Bridgette Wilson's comic touches. She got a bit typecast as the Bride left behind in several movies after this, and never got to be this funny again.So in keeping with the theme of these user comments, if you don't buy into the broad, snippy humor, you're not in for a good time. If your humor leans toward some slapstick, animals in peril, and dark get even stuff, you'll get a lot of laughs.

I watched it and left with an oh feeling. It was hilarious but it didn't leave me thinking the first time. Then I decided to watch it again and realized the ideals behind such a movie. First of all, this movie made me think of real life. Everyone has their little ticks. Chelsea's, as it may, happened to be that she figured on getting Married would make her happy for the rest of her life with her prince charming. Tired of being a bridesmaid and never the bride, she runs into Seth at a friends wedding. This is when it gets interesting.Right from the get go you realize this is not going to be a typical romantic comedy with all the usual plots and points. It's one of the few original movies I've seen in a while. It takes a mayhem ensues type of point when Chelsea immediately starts pushing for a commitment Seth realizes he's not ready for. In the many different times that this is demonstrated he seems to give in.(Spoilers)The first sign of trouble would have been the Wedding Catalogues on her table after they first meet. While her explanation of this cause goes on to convince Seth, I would think that one would log that away just as a bit odd that they would be displayed in her living room. I guess the real tell of this in a first date would have to be when she asked for a monogamous relationship after only 8 hours. But nonetheless, the way she puts the ultimatum to him, almost any man seeing an attractive woman would be willing to surpass this little glitch and move on as monogamy is almost expected these days.Chelsea pulls off he character nicely, with subtle tells that keep you going through the whole movie. The little actions that are shown throughout give away that this is a doomed relationship. As in real life, we seem to dismiss these little tells often times, blinded by attraction or love. This makes us think about the little tells in a past relationship that may have given away that it was doomed. While a lot of these might not be so painfully obvious as portrayed in the movie, it gave for an inventive twist.When the couple start fighting, indirectly attacking each other, that's when the laughs start rolling. It reminds us how truly childish many people take things to. As the movie goes on, you start to get the feeling that Chelsea may have some issues. Hers were just an example of the extreme. When paired up with a man who very obviously isn't ready to be married (I only want to do it once..) this makes for very fresh comedy.Things are taken to extremes and boundary's are crossed which could have been avoided (A simple call to the local mental institution or a showing of whose name is on the lease anyone?) it is dealt with in a comedic way which gives us more of an answer of revenge than either of the two options above.The end of this movie is very inventive and fresh. I loved it and thought it was a very good movie to watch with your significant other or your friends. It's a kind of aren't you glad we're not like that thing.Whomever said that any movie you quote religiously must be good. This one is awesome. Drop the probe and step away from my ass!Gotta Love It! 10/10  "},{"Title":"was this a comedic version of War of the roses?","Date":"17 March 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Love stinks is a movie that's hard to review. I have seen it twice now, and still don't know if I like it or not. This movie is almost a comedic version of War of the roses. It's got that same mean spiritedness to it, but is done in such an obvious, make you laugh, kind of way that viewing it, one knows not to take this movie at all seriously. Maybe it was meant to be a parody. The humer is obnoxious and mean from the beginning but because this is obviously meant to entertain-one can laugh at the jokes, knowing that in real life none of it would be very funny.In spite of this, though, Love Stinks isn't really a very good movie-you really have to like this type of humer to fully get into it. War of the roses remains one of the all time WORST movies I've ever seen but one good thing about Love stinks is that it never takes itself seriously, unlike war of the roses which was supposed to be a serious movie. This movie starts out non threateningly enough, a friend tries to talk his buddy out of eloping to vegas with his fiancée. The dysfunctional relationship between the couple, Seth and Chelsea, is told in flashbacks. This movie puts an extremely bad spin on women but again-it's done in such a tongue in cheek way that I actually laughed in a few places, becoming hysterical during one scene in particular.As the movie goes on, the humor gets meaner and meaner, as this couple ,in the midst of breaking up start striking out at each other more and more.Also, the main male in this picture(Seth)does a few things that are less then pure as well. I'd have liked the movie to be less mean and maybe stay focused on the theme of commitment and weddings instead of ultimately disintegrating into just another battling couple movie. In spite of these flaws, however, Love Stinks can be enjoyable if you let yourself get into the nasty humor, reminding yourself it's just a movie.

It is the nature of most women to control men.  Mostly because we've been in control of our lives all our lives.  Then, along comes a candidate ripe for marriage.  As a women, if you're following the Bible, you'll be submissive and allow the man to take the lead -- if you are not, you'll do what you always do, control or at least try to control.I believe, in this hilarious movie, French Stewart's character, Seth knew on some level, that this was not the right women for him.  She looked magnificent, she was a heavy hitter in the sack and she was smart and loyal.  So what more could a man ask for?  I think in this case, he just wanted to be a man and he wanted the respect that comes along with being a man.  If Bridgette Wilson's character, Chelsea was a submissive type of women, we wouldn't have this very funny, dark comedy to watch because Seth would have been willing to marry a soft, kind, non-controlling women in a minute.  Bridgette showed her true colors long before she slapped a law suit on him by changing one of his rooms into a nursery -- that should have been his first clue.  Sometimes you have to ask, why is such a beautiful women available and vise versa for us gals when picking a man.  There's always a reason they are unattached.I was curious when I started watching this movie as to how French Stewart would portray this character.  I thought he did a fantastic job -- demonstrating that he is an excellent actor.  The ending was unpredictable and I felt quite pleased with the results.In conclusion, I think no one can really speak for how someone else will perceive a movie -- I can only say, I loved Love Stinks and highly recommend it, especially to the ladies who have too much balls and the men who don't have enough!

That's right, scary.  I mean, to think that there are people running around out there in the world who actually think this kind of inane prattle is `funny' is downright frightening.  And if anything about `Love Stinks,' directed by Jeff Franklin, reflects real life in even some remote, unimaginable way, then please stop the world, I wanna get off.  This is a one note movie about a television sitcom writer named Seth (French Stewart), who gets involved with a woman, Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson),  with marriage on her mind and him in her sights.  She wants to, he doesn't, and that's about it; one note, and even at that, it's out of tune.  Unfortunately, what the makers of this movie would pass off as humor is no laughing matter; it's merely a no-joke display of mean-spiritedness and bad acting that is-- at it's best moments-- infantile, gross and disgusting.  Comedy, of course, is the most subjective of genres, and individual tastes and sensibilities will weigh in heavily in regards to how this movie will be received.  But to anyone with half a brain and any self-respect whatsoever, being subjected to ninety minutes or so of this would have to be considered nothing less than cruel and unusual punishment. 	Suffice to say that after this debacle, director Franklin will not be making the Hollywood `A' list anytime soon.  Nor the `B,' `C,' `D' or `F' lists.  The good news for him is that whatever project he takes on next couldn't possibly turn out any worse than this,  and that means he's only got one way to go from here, and that's up.  As far as the performances go, French Stewart-- who obviously went into this with his eyes wide open-- had better hope that `Third Rock From the Sun' lasts, well...forever.  Because if this is the best he can manage after the jump-start his career's received from TV, he'd be well advised to take the `Rock' money and run.  And Bridgette Wilson?  What on earth could've possessed her to take this part?  With her talent and looks this is the best she could come up with?  It makes you wonder if she even read the script before signing on to this project.  I'd like to think she either owed someone a BIG favor, or better yet, was the victim of a plot by a bitter and disgruntled manager or agent to malign her for personal, as yet undisclosed, reasons.  The bottom line is, Stewart and Wilson both have a lot to offer; it just seems so sad to see them wasted in something as unworthy as this ridiculous, offensive movie that isn't worth the film that retains it's untoward images. 	The supporting cast includes Bill Bellamy as Larry, Tyra Banks as Holly (proving here that beauty does not necessarily equate with acting ability), Steve Hytner as Marty, Jason Bateman (in a horrendous performance) as Jesse, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as Rebecca.  A supercilious effort that has to resort to bathroom humor, cat cruelty and an Elvis impersonator in it's feeble attempt at getting a laugh-- which it doesn't (and note that even the word `humor' is used loosely within the context of this sentence)-- `Love Stinks' is a movie to be avoided at all costs.  If someone perchance suggests to you that this one is entertaining and good for some laughs, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!  Or at least for the nearest exit.  Immediately.  And don't look back...

About the time our male main character realises he's together with an idiot and starts a kind of war of the roses with her, he doesn't seem to think about why he hooked up with her in the first place. Why did he? There's no answer! Who needs the questions! This movie just exists! It takes up space! Who can blame him, I guess, he's just a bad, hollow movie character attracted to another bad, hollow movie character.Contrary to belief, comedy requires comedic talent. If there's no talent involved, any comedy will implode into a strange, awkward and inexplicable waste of time. It's been a while since I happened to catch a movie that so well demonstrates this. From beginning to end the movie is pointless, incomprehensible and worthless. Or, let me put it like this, and I never thought I'd ever in a million years say this Tyra Banks is way too good for this.

Not once did I crack a smile at the dialogue or the physical comedy of this piece of cinematic garbage. French Stewart is one of the worst actors I have ever watched, and I will be surprised if he ever works in film again.The rest of the cast did their best with the material given to them, but what resulted was the most mindless, unfunny performances in any movie I have ever seen. Special note to the writer and director just because you put the word f*ck into your movie about a hundred times, this does not mean that your screenplay will be any funnier; try having a punchline to go along with the swearing next time. The one and only bright spot in this whole mess is the always funny Jason Bateman, who should have played the lead. To summarize, don't watch this movie; don't make your friends watch this movie; don't make your dog watch this movie! Just leave it on the shelf where it belongs. Together, we can stop this plague of a movie from spreading any further than it has and from ruining any more Saturday nights at home.  "}]
