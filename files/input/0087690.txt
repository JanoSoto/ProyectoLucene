Lee Van Clief may have been far too old, flabby, and frail to physically convince the audience that he could be a ninja master (amazing how he lost his gut whenever the stunt double stood in for him in the black ninja costume) but he did project a certain old school machismo and he could always deliver a good line. Yes, Demi Moore stuck out like a sore thumb in episode 1, and the wheelchair chick and the dancer from episode two delivered some of the worst lines in the history of television, but still...There were some decent stunts (for a TV series) and some energetic sword fights and a few decent attempts at wry East-meets-West humor. It was never 'great' the way The Fugitive was great, but it didn't actively suck...at first. And episode 2 had one great line (even though Van Patten flubbed it) I knew the Master would find a way to get me up on a tightrope sooner or later. Given the situation, it was pretty funny. The problem lay in the fact that a) the producers rapidly ran out of ideas after the first few episodes, reducing the show to a buddy version of Then Came Bronson, and b) Timothy Van Patten's mush-mouthed delivery and frozen faced acting got old quick and c) there was very little chemistry between the two lead actors. Anyone who wasn't a male adolescent with an obsession with martial arts would find very little to interest them, especially since the series producers watered down the 'ninja' content extensively - they seemed to be trying to increase the series' appeal to American audiences, but they only alienated that core element who was only watching the show for the ninja action in the first place.Especially annoying was the fact that Van Patten was supposed to be some kind of Tiger Beat teen-idol and had a different love interest in every episode, but the lack of chemistry between him and his female of the week was apparent even to a blind man. To be fair to Van Patten, the writers put him in some incredibly contrived situations and gave him some very dopey dialog to convey his hipness...I'm not sure Cary Grant could have pulled off some of those scenes.Although I spend a lot of time thinking about and practicing martial arts, I gave up on this series by episode 4, and every time I checked in on it for a minute or two (as the season wore on) I found even less to keep me going back. It looks like everyone else agreed, and the show sank without a trace. Too bad...but the series was a day late (to cash in on Bruce Lee) and a dollar short (wasn't willing to live up to the potential of its concept).

The era embodied a sort of innocence which dissipated towards the end of the decade and has sadly yet to return. Who can forget the fads of the time; In music we 'bopped' along to the sounds of New Romantics, pioneering synth pop acts and additionally were blessed with a wonderful array of 'big hair' heavy metal bands. On TV we enjoyed such classics as Knight Rider, Airwolf and the incomparable, The A-Team and in cinemas we were treated to probably the best decade for horror and action movies......yes, the eighties....ah, they were the days.There was actually another craze that swept the western world during the early part of the decade also; What was it you may ask? Why it was Ninja Mania! We just couldn't get enough of these enigmatic stealth assassins in fact. The public obsession first began proper when the Cannon Film Group released the Sho Kosugi outing, Enter the Ninja in 1984. Kosugi himself went on to a semblance of super stardom literally overnight - this despite the fact that he was actually playing the films main villain! Such was the mystique and allure that these historical figures exuded on screen. Needless to say, more ninja flicks were swiftly put into production by a plethora of film companies, each trying to out do the last and cash in on the publics apparent insatiable fixation on all things connected to the ninja. It was inevitable of course that these seemingly semi-mystical beings would break out into other entertainment mediums also. This they did in the form of numerous comic books, novels, toys, games and in the instance reviewed here, a television series starring veteran actor, Lee Van Cleef and as it happens, the by this time living legend, Sho Kosugi.The plot concerned Cleef's character returning from Japan where he had spent years studying the ninja arts, in order to find his estranged daughter. Also along for the ride was the token wise cracking side kick (as was a somewhat unfortunate trend of the eighties....) who becomes Cleef's new student. Unfortunately, our veteran ninja is also being hotly pursued by a fellow ninja from his clan (Kosugi) who is incessantly intent on sending him to the great beyond.Despite ninja mania in full swing at the time, the show curiously lasted for only one season before disappearing as quickly as......um.......well, a ninja in fact.Whilst mildly enjoyable in its own right, it has to be said that the series was unfortunately hampered by its incredibly formulaic treatment. As with the vast majority of eighties TV shows, the plot was never more ambitious than to set our heroes (who just like in every other eighties show), travelling around from place to place helping out those in trouble (invariably a sexy, feisty female) from evil property developers and the like. Every now and then to spice things up, Kosugi puts in an appearance and it's no coincidence that these episodes are the best of the series which sans his presence is somewhat pedestrian at best.For a bit of nostalgia or else those still desperate for a fix of anything ninja related the series is probably worth a look as long as you don't set your expectations too high.

Once in America, he meets Max Keller, played by Timothy Van Patten, who teams up with McAlister to help find his daughter. Along the way, the duo travel in an A-Team-like van and engage in various adventures while helping those in need. McAlister also teaches Keller the finer points of ninjitsu in his spare time. The Master takes place in various cities across America, however, it was shot entirely in Los Angeles, CA. Sho Kosugi also appears in a handful of episodes as Okasa, an evil ninja hunting McAlister.While I enjoyed this series, the casting was questionable. Lee Van Cleef was a fine actor, but he was totally miscast in this series. He was in no shape to do any of the fighting required for this series. He is quite obviously stunt doubled by Sho Kosugi(wearing a skull cap!) in almost all of the fight scenes. Van Patten is also stunt doubled in some of the fight scenes.This series was released as a series of seven videos with the name Master Ninja.If you enjoy ninja flicks or martial arts in general, give this a try.P.S.

Heck, even if they had a decent following, a lot of these shows still got canceled for the simple fact they cost a whole heck of a lot of money to produce. This one is kind of an A-team, Spider-man (the television series), buddy show with a ninja twist. Lee Van Cleef is the ninja and while I will not question his acting credentials, one still has to wonder why he was selected to star in this show. He is good as the guy giving wisdom to his young sidekick, but he is so obviously not the ninja, as he has a belly and staggers in places while the ninja is doing tight rope work. Still, he is not bad and is the best thing about the show as the younger guy Max played by Timothy Van Patten is insufferable. He is the kind of guy you want to see get beat up, who begs to get beat up and we are supposed to be pulling for him. Nope, not happening, he is annoying and you have a hard time understanding him. He and Van Cleef drive around the countryside in a van, like in A-team. They end up helping people in distress along the way...again like A-team. Max does have a hamster so that is not like A-team. When he dons his ninja gear, Van Cleef will scale many a tall building which is where it has a Spider-man type feel to me. A lot of sort of stars guest star as there are a lot of has beens in this one and some up and comers as you see a pre-Wings Crystal Bernard. You also get to see George Lazenby, known for doing one Bond movie and thinking that was enough to skyrocket him to fame. This show is very 80's and simply to silly to be taken to seriously.

It seems I've been let down twice by the same show, for different reasons!

This film holds it's place next to such abysmal films such as the Fugitive Alien movies, Time of the Apes, and Mighty Jack. The major difference between this film and the others is that this came from America! No trashy dubbing, all in English. The plot (cough) of this garbage concerns Lee Van Cleef and Timothy Van Patten going on all sorts of adventures. May I add completely uninteresting adventures that nobody cares about. To make things worse, there's a sequel! Yep, more inept trash identical to this. There is a bright side to all of this, however, all of the movies mentioned here were riffed on MST3K!

Not that the commentary was bad, but the movie itself. The acting was just atrocious, even deathstalker 3 had better acting than this! The music, was simply painful to hear. Watching two ninjas fight while cheesy 80s synthsizer tunes played in the BG was unbearable. There was this one scene (SPOILER) where 3 ninjas try to kill the master. Instead of prowling on his roof or doing anything remotely stealthy, the ninjas got into these stupid poses and walked right into the master's front door where he was just standing there looking. To give you an idea, imagine 3 ninjas walking behind a paper wall so you can only see their shadows. Then imagine while they're walking, they're in these crane stances like the one in karate kid. It is dumb I know. Thankfully Joel and the Bots made this movie very funny to watch, they always do a good job of that. "}]
