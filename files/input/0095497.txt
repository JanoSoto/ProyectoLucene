I can never relate to those films, so they aren't believable. The Last Temptation of Christ is totally different. It was banned by intolerant Christians who didn't even see it because they have conflicting viewpoints, which is one hell of a paradox. I use to say that Christ was described as a demi-god in the Bible because He is half-man and half-god, but I was told that He is really all-man and all-god. If the latter thesis is correct, than he most have all the perfections of god as well as all the faults of man. In the movie, Jesus is not perfect. He sins, or at least, He confesses sins. He is haunted by visions and sounds almost to where He goes on the brink of insanity. He is tempted by Satan over and over again into thinking that he is just a man. When He cures a person of blindness, He does not smile, he frowns in pain because for every man he cures, he knows it brings him closer to the cross. The characterization in this  movie is excellent. This script is Schrader's best, although it was rewritten. The music is the best I've ever heard in any films. Scorsese's direction was absolutely superb. Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel were excellent as well. And the movie leads you to the most haunting portayal of the crucifixion in cinematic history.It is a must for any person to see, especially if you were outraged by the fact that Jesus is displayed as imperfect. You cannot do the film justice if you don't watch the whole film. You may be offended throughout the entire film, but it all comes together in the end and all is well. Seriously, I give the film five stars.

It is one of the most powerful and ultimately one of the greatest films ever made, without a doubt. The performances, especially by Willem Dafoe as Jesus, are amazing; the sets and costumes are realistic and never feel forced, glossy, or stylized (and were based on extensive archaeological and philological research); Peter Gabriel's score is absolutely unbelievable...I cannot possibly praise this film enough, as well as Mr. Scorcese's courage in making such a bold and beautiful work of art in the face of considerable opposition.It is really best to avoid religious and theological arguments about this film - it is simply a portrait of Christ coming to terms with who he is and what he must do. If it occasionally portrays Jesus in a manner that is somewhat at odds with that of scripture, try to keep in mind that it is merely another take on a story that has no absolute and authoritative telling. That Jesus has difficulty coming to terms with the role he must play is something that scripture does not rule out.Consider it this way this is the sort of film that has the power to convince the irreligious or non-Christians out there (of which I am one) of the importance, beauty, depth, and truth of Jesus' vision of a world filled with love and compassion. Give this movie a chance. You will not be disappointed.

Fantastic film-making - yes!","Date":"14 April 2005","Score":"72 out of 94 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Has there ever been a more misunderstood film than Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation Of Christ? Released amid great controversy and accused of being an offensive and unholy film, the truth of the matter is that it is a deeply reverent work which has the courage to ask challenging questions about the pressures and doubts Jesus must have experienced as the appointed Messiah. It also shows the violence of the times in graphic detail. If viewers consider it blasphemous to explore on film the immense burden of duty that Jesus bore through his life, then they are narrow-minded and ignorant. If people feel that to show the brutality and harshness of life in Roman times is tasteless and inappropriate, then they are guilty of glorifying difficult but factual truths. There is NOTHING offensive about this film. There is, however, much that is challenging.Jesus (Willem Dafoe), an honest carpenter, saves Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) from a stoning. Already dimly aware that he is destined to lead an extraordinary life, he soon finds himself being drawn into the role of a religious figurehead. But Jesus finds it hard to accept that he is a Messiah, and as his reputation and following grows he constantly questions if he is a strong enough man to handle the burden of being God's son. After isolating himself in the desert, where he experiences several hallucinations in which he is confronted by visual manifestations of good and evil, Jesus finally concludes that he IS the true son of God and whole-heartedly sets about imparting his love and wisdom to all who'll listen. Later betrayed to the disgruntled Romans by his friend Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), Jesus is crucified. While on the cross, he imagines what his life would have turned out like if he had shied away from his duty as the Messiah and lived life like a mere mortal.It is this final section of the film that has provoked the most vociferous outrage. The sequence shows Jesus as he slowly dies on the cross, dreaming of an alternative life in which he sins and copulates and hates like all normal people. Many people have criticised the film on the grounds that these scenes are blasphemous. Such claims are nonsense - the film is not saying that Jesus was a sinner, nor that he gave in to temptation of the flesh, nor still that he was a man filled with hate. The film is merely saying that, in such great pain and so close to death while still just a young man, he might - just maybe - have wondered if it was all worth it. At the end of the film, we see Jesus accept his role knowing that his death is the ultimate act of unselfish love, so the film actually is totally in agreement with what all Christians believe. If the film had come to the conclusion that Jesus's whole life was a waste, his death too, then maybe the detractors would've had cause to complain. But how can they possibly be offended by the film as it stands? For goodness sake, it's a film about absolute faith!!! In truth, The Last Temptation Of Christ is an excellent movie. Compellingly acted, beautifully shot on Moroccan locations, and full of telling ideas, it is a work of real depth and power. The accents are sometimes distracting and some of the dialogue occasionally betrays ill-suited modernisms, but apart from these minor drawbacks it is one of the most important and thought-provoking films ever made.

Instead of showing Christ as a fearless and perfect person, The Last Temptation depicts Him as a person who fought his destiny and wished to be just another mortal human being. Religious groups who couldn't (and still can't) accept the fact that Jesus was human were shocked by such ideas and refused to see the film or read the landmark novel on which it was based. They'll never know that they attacked one of the most honest and loving depictions of Christ.The Christ we see in the film is not based on the teachings of the Gospels, or any scripture for that matter. Instead we get a portrait of Christ the man, not Christ the Savior. We get to see his faults, his fears and anxieties. Then, we get to see him overcome those and find the strength to fulfill his destiny. The Last Temptation of Christ is not afraid to say that Jesus was weak before he became the Savior, and that makes the film all the more satisfying. This is a tale of redemption, courage, and love like no other.There is no reason to miss this film. Not everyone will like it, but at the very least it will let you see another perspective of the story. And even if you can't accept the story, you won't be able to deny the greatness of Scorsese's direction. From the epic crowd scenes, to the intimate one-on-one conversations, to the stunning final shot (which was actually caused by an overexposed section of film, but is beautiful nonetheless), you will be awed by Scorsese's work here.Also stunning is the work of the two leads. Willem Dafoe inhabits the role of Christ perfectly, bringing perfectly controlled emotion to each and every scene. Harvey Keitel as Judas has been the subject of debate because of his NYC accent. That was on purpose (Scorsese used accents to denote the descent of characters. American accent = Israelite; British accent = Roman), but it doesn't even matter. Keitel is brilliant no matter what his accent is.Honest, human, loving, and unafraid, The Last Temptation of Christ is one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Martin Scorsese crafted with this film his most personal masterpiece, and perhaps his greatest masterpiece ever.

I was amazed with all of the performances. This is certainly one of Martin Scorsese's great accomplishments in his extensive and highly acclaimed carrier. This movie was very important to Scorsese and he would put it off several times because he felt he wasn't ready to do it. I think that the wait was worth it, because this was an outstanding movie. This is one of those movies that you either really liked, or really didn't like. Most of the people who didn't like this found it to be a mockery of the Gospels and Christ himself. I liked it because it did follow the Bible very closely, it was a fantastic telling of Jesus Christ's last days and his greatest accomplishments, and because the acting was very good.I thought Willem Defoe was spell binding as Jesus Christ. Some people will say that he wasn't enough like Jesus, but you do have to realize that this is probably the hardest character to play and I think that Defoe did the best job that anyone could have done at playing Christ. Harvey Keitel did an equally excellent job at playing Judas, Jesus's best friend, who eventually betrays Him so the world can be saved. This may be Keitel's best performance (if not, it is one of the three). Barbara Hershey was also a great supporting roll as Mary Magdalene.This movie is certainly not for everyone. Many people with very strong religious convictions will see this movie as offensive, simply because Christ is portrayed a frightened man who sees his fate as a burdon through 'half' of the film, and I implicate the word 'half' for a reason. For everyone else, I say go rent this, because this is a powerful and magnificent version of the final months of Christ.

Martin Scorsese, for whom this was a long labor of love, directs a beautiful movie with all around excellent performances, particularly Harvey Keitel as Judas and Willem Defoe as Jesus.

Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ is, despite and because of these things, a brilliant film, one that approaches closest to Christianity's core obsessions and problems. It also serves as a perfect palette cleanser for those who had the distinct misfortune of watching Mel Gibson's processing of Jesus Christ through the Hollywood meat-grinder for (deeply disturbing personal reasons and) money.But Gibson's dementia aside. Martin Scorsese's film is profoundly quiet and thought-provoking. Is it blasphemous? Or rather, is the controversy it stirred justified? I'd say so. Paul Shrader, the writer of the film, himself admits that on a certain level the film is blasphemy. But not literally. It uses God as a conceit for man's condition and struggle to understand God. And this desire to comprehend which pervades the film renders its blasphemy a noble one. Or forgivable one. The film, after all, explores the relationship between the human and finite with the divine and infinite with a passion present in all aspects of it. The Last Temptation is about the struggle of those two, particularly in the face of destiny and death. In that sense, it is a very existential film. Dafoe's Jesus at first doubts he is even God's son. He doesn't know - he searches. He reaches false conclusions and true ones. The beauty of his struggle lies precisely in not always knowing the answers. He is, after all, human.And then again, he is not. However, on its own, this statement means very little. The film probes the relationship of the Jesus of Nazareth who sins like the rest of us, with Christ, the son of God who is sacrificed for our sins. It explores the nature and meaning of that sacrifice. The segment that I would imagine caused the greatest amount of controversy, namely (not surprisingly) Christ's last temptation, provides the bridge between Christ and pre-Christ, Jesus of Nazareth. It asks us to imagine Jesus being saved from death. And through this theoretical contemplation we see the necessity of the sacrifice, its binding nature. Judas, in fact, summarizes this perfectly by saying The life of a man is not for you. Your place is on the cross (I am paraphrasing, but the point is there). Jesus' struggle, throughout the film, ends exactly at this point, at this realization which allows him to say on the cross It is accomplished. The fact that this struggle is made real and accessible to us is what makes this a phenomenal film.The film's brilliance shines on pretty much all levels. Scorsese's direction is atmospheric, extremely compassionate and restrained (as opposed to the orgiastic explosion of unnecessary? violence in Gibson's film). The performances are great. Hershey's Mary Magdalene is amazing. Dafoe's Jesus and even more so Keitel's Judas are brilliant. In fact, Judas in this film is almost as much a central character as Jesus. In The Last Temptation Judas isn't the evil traitor who gets himself killed over a maggot-ridden corpse like in Gibson's tale, but a character so full of love he *agrees* to betray Christ. The act of betrayal here is one of coming to terms with fate very much on the same level as Jesus' acceptance of his self-sacrifice. Judas must betray Christ even though he has grown to love him.There are many reasons to see this film. It is a deeply spiritual examination of Christ the man and Christ the Son of God and the transition from one to the other. In some way, it is a perfect portrait of a man's search for answers and for God - it is spiritual existentialism, uncannily similar to Kierkegaard. It is the exact opposite of The Passion of the Christ and it should be celebrated.

He takes on a subject close to his heart and close to his faith. Nikos Kazantzakis wrote an extraordinary piece of work on the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The last temptation takes place while Jesus is on the cross, but before that we watch Jesus (William Dafoe) try to overcome temptation as an everyday man. That's what Kazantzakis focuses on. While Christ is on the cross the pain and sacrifice wouldn't be the same if he didn't feel it and showing Jesus in the form of an everyday man may offend some devout Christians, but if they're offended then they're missing the point. God sent his son down to this earth to die for mans sins. That's what scriptures tell us, but Kazantzakis takes us down an intriguing road as the son of God battles the temptations of the everyday man, yet without sin. We watch Jesus struggle with acceptance that he is the messiah, but eventually he accepts his role. We watch Jesus tempted by evil, but he resists. When some hit's him, he turns the other cheek. He has love and he has love for everyone and everything. He doesn't have hate, he doesn't have sin, Jesus is a perfect creature in a man's body sent to do God's work. Martin Scorsese depicts him no differently than he's imagined or believed to have been.The final act is the greatest part of the film (maybe the most controversial). It shows Jesus taken down, off the cross, by his guardian angel- something that didn't happen according scriptures. As you watch this and if you know the story and haven't read the novel, you become baffled. You don't know what to think or how to interpret it. We see Jesus doing things he never did, like having sex, having children, and living out the rest of his life as an everyday man; living a good, humble life, old and tired. Only until the final moment and the final shot of the film, does the entire third act make complete sense, which makes the final statement by Jesus all that more powerful; It is accomplished! It isn't done in a negative manner. Kazantzakis and Scorsese aren't showing Jesus full of sin for no good reason. Showing the hallucination and showing Satan tempting Christ in his weakest moment is what makes Jesus' sacrifice even more powerful. Not only did he die for the sin of man, but he died for the sin of man while being tempted to live a normal and happy life as a man by Satan in the form of a beautiful guardian angel. There would be no torture; no death; no pain; no sacrifice, but here, Jesus fights his temptations and accepts his role and the path God sent him on. He dies on the cross in agony with temptation from Satan at his weakest moment. He's triumphant in a way that is hard to see triumph, but not only does he accept the sins of man, and not only does he sacrifice his life, but he defeats Satan and conquers temptation... as a man. Jesus is a powerful figure without sin and neither Scorsese nor Kazantzakis show him as anything less than the Lord and Savior. The film should leave you questioning your ability to resist temptation as Jesus did. As a devout Christian, one would think, you'd be more appreciative of the depiction in this film than any other film ever made on this subject. The Last Temptation of Christ is a powerful film done without sensation, without hate, but with taste, respect, love and appreciation for his sacrifices and his ability to resist temptation and go on with the plan when, as a man, Jesus could have taken the easy way out. He didn't. He sacrificed his life and went through the pain and suffering as a man. Not as a God, where he knows there is no pain and he'll born again in three days, but as a man that can feel all the things we feel and resist all things we don't resist.Personally I have serious doubts about every word that I've come across, or every biblical story I've ever heard. I am not a Christian. I'm not atheist. I'm nothing more than a skeptic, but this film did something that I would never think possible; I had a religious experience and almost, for a second, became a believer. This is one of the most profound and powerful films ever made even though it has some serious flaws. You don't have to believe in God or Christianity to enjoy this film, simply an opened mind.

This alone will rile many viewers, but it does not bother me. My problem with this movie lies in an entirely different direction.(May Contain Spoilers)This movie is a triumph of execrable writing, pretentious dialogue, and acting for which the word bad is entirely insufficient. After seeing Mel Gibson's brilliant Passion of the Christ, with Semitic-looking actors speaking in Aramaic and Latin, watching Harvey Keitel in flaming Irish red hair and Brooklyn accent play Judas was a real shock. There are other shocks in store, such as a John the Baptist; who, rather than preaching repentance, incites Jesus to violent overthrow of the Romans; John's disciples, who are either in the grip of religious ecstasy or crippling madness (I found the three nude women swaying their heads in unison and mumbling incoherently to be particularly disturbing), and one mind-bending scene in which Jesus pulls out his own heart with one hand while holding an axe in the other.The movie's main problem is Jesus himself. Willem Defoe's Jesus is a wimpy crybaby. He could give Anakin Skywalker a run for his money (I don't *wanna* be the Son of God! I wanna go to Tahashi Station and pick up some power converters!). And speaking of Star Wars references, Satan's temptation in the desert seems to have been lifted from Darth Vader's Luke, join me speech. Not that the effects budget of this turkey matched that of a Lucas film--Satan in that scene seemed to be a flaming gas burner buried just under the sand and turned up on hi. Jesus' self-pitying lines (my God is fear, etc) ensured that I would feel no sympathy with this character.The cinematography was visually jarring and unpleasant to watch. The casting was woefully mismanaged. I have seen all the anglo-Jesus films, and a Brooklyn Judas and blonde, bushy-bearded Midwestern Nathaniel would have been easier to take had not the supporting cast looked like they all came from Southern India! The heterogeneity of the cast torpedoed all suspension of disbelief. For the final insult, Scorsese employs the ultimate narrative cop-out it was all a dream! Or a hallucination, or whatever. I realize this was the ending in the book, but the movie could have been something better.

At the time of its release in 1988, it garnered intense hatred from many religious organizations and civilian protestors. Fearing repercussions, United Artists (the largest theater chain in the country) refused to show it. Most of this animosity did not come from offended audiences, but from those who had not seen the film. In the some cases the opposition passed judgment only through speculation and hearsay. Quick conclusions and misinterpretations prevent the film from the true recognition and praise it deserves. The film must not be shunned or banned because of superficial complaints; it uses the character of Jesus as a brilliant and thought-provoking illustration of the internal conflict of humanity and spirituality. The first of many complaints contends that the film depicts Jesus inaccurately. This complaint exemplifies the protestors' ignorance, for they miss the film's goal entirely. The filmmakers clearly reveal their intentions in a message preceding the film where they explain that the film is not (nor intends to be) based on the Gospels, but in reality `is a fictional exploration of . eternal spiritual conflict'. To demonstrate this point, the film uses the concept of fictional history, a fictionalized retelling of true events, and applies it to Jesus by changing events to make a point. Christianity teaches that Jesus is fully human, and yet fully divine; Nikos Kazantzakis, the writer of the film's source material, sees it as an `incessant, merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh'. Martin Scorsese, using stark imagery and powerful compositions, does his best to illustrate this battle. Together, they have made Jesus in to more of a reluctant prophet than the Son of God. Rejecting God and yearning to human, Jesus only accepts his own divinity after a great internal struggle. Detailing the hardships of acceptance displays the great will power that Jesus possessed and ultimately strengthens his character. According to many religious protestors, turning Jesus into a fictionalized character for a movie and changing Biblical events to serve the story constitutes blasphemy. The First Presbyterian Church of Rowlett claims `.the film 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is idolatrous and blasphemous and attempts to bring shame upon the person of our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.'.  The complaint of blasphemy is a fair one, for the filmmakers themselves admit that it's true on a conceptual level. However, claims that the film attempts to bring shame upon Jesus are completely unfounded. It may be considered blasphemous, but the message illustrated by it only strengthens Jesus' character. To publicly proclaim the film as shameful with little or no attempt to understand intentions or underlying message of the film is not only wrong, but also irresponsible. Screenwriter Paul Shrader explains that the mainstream media renders Jesus as an immaculately holy figure and nothing else. Shrader feels the image portrayed is far too one-sided, ignoring all human emotions he may have had. The film explores the human side of Jesus to reveal all the doubts and temptations he might have had; doing this makes his final divine acceptance very meaningful. To illustrate the obstacles Jesus has overcome, Scorsese must explore his temptations in the film - an area of powerful debate.* * * SPOILER * * *An extended portion of the film deals with Jesus, while on the cross, seeing what it would be like if he were fully human. We watch as Jesus imagines all the activities of a normal life including love, marriage, and children. In a particularly controversial scene in the reverie, we see Jesus make love to his wife, Mary Magdalene. Roger Ebert, who gave the film his highest rating, defends the scene `This scene is shot with such restraint and tact that it does not qualify in any way as a 'sex scene', but instead is simply an illustration of marriage and the creation of children'. Again the protestors cry blasphemy and miss the point completely; the film later reveals that Satan has fabricated the vision to tempt Jesus out of redemption. The controversial scenes in the dream are completely logical because the greatest temptation of all is something one cannot attain, and for Jesus it is an ordinary human life.* * * END SPOILER * * *Viewers must not hastily condemn a controversial film without gaining a proper understanding of its underlining message. The Last Temptation of Christ conveys a very positive statement about faith and sacrifice. To denounce the film on account of the means of storytelling the film employs is shallow and irresponsible. The film may be guilty of blasphemy on the surface, but the significance of the story is something people of any religion should appreciate.

It turns out that life isn't all it's cracked up to be, and things end up terrible because he never died for peoples' sins. It's basically It's a Wonderful Life except instead of George Bailey never being born, it's Jesus Christ never being crucified.I really loved this movie, the way it was presented was amazing. It was so vivid and dreamlike; you feel very up close and personal with Jesus, especially since you can actually hear his thoughts. The acting is just great. Willem Dafoe fills Jesus' sandals quite nicely and provides a believable different angle of a Jesus who has fear, weakness, self-doubt, and seems to be making things up as he goes along. There are many complaints about Harvey Keitel's performance as Judas (most notably the thick New York accent) and many say it's the one thing that brings down the movie, but I thought he was great. He's definitely the most interesting apostle since he actually betrayed his leader- the movie suggests that Jesus was closest to him and he requested that Judas should betray him so he could fulfill his destiny on the cross. Hey, ya never know.This is typical Scorsese mastery. It's a thought-provoking, emotional film that will stick with you for a long time. Just try to remember it's only a movie and it's just offering a different point of view of Jesus Christ. And most likely a more accurate one, too.My rating 10/10 "},{"Title":"","Date":"11 February 1999","Score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I must state before I talk about the movie that I have been a Christian for the last five years. I live my life to be Christlike, as well as I do believe with all of my heart in the story of the gospels.I must say, of all of the variations I've heard telling the story of Jesus Christ, through seven years of presbyterian school and nineteen years of catholic upbringing, this movie by far offers the most compelling, the most accessible, and is the only one that really makes Jesus out to what I believe him to be.Supposedly Jesus was the Son of God and supposedly Jesus was a human. So what is wrong with him being tempted as every man is? There is a huge difference between being tempted and actually committing the sin. The miracle of Jesus is that he did not sin. He did not succumb to the carnal desires that all men must invariably do. Yet his struggle to resist temptation as well as find out who He really was makes him all the more human and the story of Christ so much more inspiring.Scorsese's vision coupled with Willem DaFoe in the best performance of his career capture that struggle and that humanity. And as a result, I've never been more proud to be a Christian.

It is mostly a given that in a film about Jesus the truths of Christian faith must be accepted before you can appreciate what happens on the screen. Passion of the Christ is the ultimate example an act of faith more than an entertaining or thoughtful piece of cinema. Last Temptation of Christ is very different. The similarity between both films ends at the controversy preceding their release.The film shows us a tortured and uncertain man, Jesus, prone to visions and hallucinations, a carpenter who lives a hard life in Nazareth (he builds crosses and sees messihas die frequently, and his childhood friend Mary Magdaleine is a prostitute). Already this smells more of artistic license than gospel quotes, but it also rings truer and more brutally in keeping with the time than what is briefly summed up in the Good Book. The tense struggle between Israelite terrorists (including Judas) and Roman conquerors provides a violent background for this harsh environment. Out of this, Jesus comes to interpret his voices as the call of God and is ushered on by Judas, who sees in him not the son of God but a future independent leader for Israel. The misunderstanding between the two men is a wonderful contrast to their bizarre but strong friendship. As he gathers followers and takes on the role of Messia, he finally confronts roman power and, of his own will, is betrayed and crucified. On the cross, before finally giving himself completely to his cause, he reflects upon what a normal life might have been like...Never has an embodiment of Jesus been so human or a film about him being so deliciously ambiguous. The wonder is that if you approach it with a slightly open mind,you will find it solid and appealing to your views as a Christian, it can give a new dimension to The Son of God, hence greater weight to his sacrifice. If you aren't a believer, it is a good portrayal of a gentle but weak mind sinking slowly into insanity, but through his conviction inspiring others. As a film, there are many reasons why this should be recommended viewing despite some flaws (Brooklyn accents and a blond Jesus) Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel are an excellent screen duo and embody their respective characters with conviction and sincerity, instead of being completely subdued by the role and religious reverence (as is the case in most Jesus films, especially Passion), an unexpectedly good performance is given by a multi-layered Pilate, played by David Bowie. The direction is concise, tasteful and elegant without being intrusive and Scorsese handles the more delicate scenes (the miracles) with a certain subtlety absent from most films on the same subject. The oft-mentioned score by Peter Gabriel is perfect. Paul Schrader's screenplay probably deserves slightly more credit than any else's contribution, for keeping a fair balance between the legendary and the more rational and historical aspects of the story. All in all, this film should not be dismissed as wildly indulgent to either side in the eternal believer/atheist debate, but thoughtfully approached by all. Because in the end, what matters is its qualities as a movie, and they are, to say the least, significant!

As an aside to those who like to caricature Christians, it might be worth noting that fundamentalist Christians represent only a small portion of those who would claim the name Christian, but they do get a disproportionate amount of attention - as do ultra-liberal Christians for that matter. As a Christian (non-fundamentalist, non ultra-liberal, non-extremist and quite mainstream; as one who accepts both the divinity and sacrifice of Jesus and the truth of the Scriptures) I found this movie to be both quite moving and very challenging. As is pointed out in a disclaimer at the movie's beginning, the story is not based on the Gospels (except very loosely in the sense that many of the scenes in the Gospels are included, up to and including the crucifixion) but rather is a representation of the spiritual journey of Nikos Kazantzakis, the writer of the novel on which this movie is based. The most controversial part of the movie is probably the last half hour or so, in which Jesus is depicted as a man living in intimate relationship with two women (both Mary and Martha - the sisters of Lazarus) with children and (eventually) grandchildren, living a comfortable and happy life. What the critics seem to have missed is that this was - as the title implies - Satan's last temptation to Jesus, in a desperate attempt to get him off the cross - a futile attempt in the end, as Jesus is clearly portrayed as having overcome the temptation. It is accomplished, he cries from the cross. Some argue that this shouldn't have tempted Jesus, because Jesus as divine was therefore perfect. But theologically, Jesus' perfection rests on his ability to overcome temptation, not to avoid it. Why would this last temptation be any more offensive than any other temptation - such as Satan offered him in the wilderness. Of course Jesus could be tempted. Of course, Jesus could have succumbed to temptation - otherwise the biblical accounts of Jesus being tempted in the wilderness are pointless. The perfection of Jesus is displayed in his choosing not to give in to temptation when he could have chosen to give in to temptation.The portrayal of Jesus in the first two hours of the movie might have caused some angst - portraying, as it does, a confused and fearful Jesus, struggling with God's call and uncertain how to proceed. (Although Luke's Gospel does affirm that Jesus had to grow in wisdom.) Hats off to Willem Dafoe for his portrayal of Jesus. I've never really been a huge fan of Dafoe, but thought he nailed this part perfectly - perhaps the best film portrayal of Jesus I've seen. Harvey Keitel presented an equally fascinating portrayal of Judas Iscariot, who is, in a sense, the hero of this movie in that he's the one who, in the end, jolts Jesus out of the temptation and back to reality. Another performance worth mentioning is that of Juliette Caton - the young actress who portrayed Satan pretending to be Jesus' guardian angel sent to take him off the cross. She was quite good in the role (and presented, to me, a convincing portrayal of Satan - unthreatening, innocent, concerned.) I've never seen her in anything else, but based on this one performance, I'm surprised her acting career doesn't seem to have gone much farther.What more is to say. It's interesting to compare this to The Passion Of The Christ, a movie that also aroused deep feelings both for and against. I liked Passion. I thought it was a very well done account of the crucifixion, which is what it was meant to portray. I have to say, though, that I thought Last Temptation was better. It's a superb movie that both challenges and deepens faith. It's a superb movie that flies by and that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish. If Passion is a 9 - which I voted it - then Last Temptation has to be a 10. It's the superior movie.

Ultimately however he fulfils this destiny, but his cause prompts the Roman authorities to capture and crucify him, martyring him for all time for the sins of mankind.Because any story about religious faith is an intensely spiritual and cerebral concept, the Jesus story is hard to film (the best adaptation is the 1977 Franco Zeffirelli / Robert Powell TV miniseries Jesus Of Nazareth, and the best cinema version is the 1961 Nicholas Ray / Jeffrey Hunter film King Of Kings). This movie is not based on the gospels, but rather on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, which retells many of the gospel parables (the sermon on the mount, the stoning of Mary Magdalene, the raising of Lazarus, the money-changers in the temple, the tale of John the Baptist, etc), but with a radically different emphasis on character. Christ is very much a man in this movie, full of fear, doubt and self-pity, struggling with the significance of his destiny, and both Judas and Magdalene feature much more prominently in his story. It ends with a dream sequence in which Satan disguises himself as a child and tempts Christ on the cross with an end to his suffering and a dream of a life as an ordinary man with a family; a temptation which Christ ultimately rejects. It is an extraordinarily powerful, original and thought-provoking examination of Christianity, which has at its heart the fundamental conflict between Christ the Man and Christ the God. It is also exquisitely made and passionately acted by a terrific cast. Dafoe gives a masterful performance in a role which is almost impossible to play, and Keitel, Hershey and Stanton all give tremendous support, while Bowie is an inspired scene-stealing piece of casting as the status-quo-seeking Pilate (There are three-thousand skulls on Golgotha, probably more. I do wish you people would go and count them sometime.). Brilliantly scripted by Paul Schrader, with superb location photography in Morocco by Michael Ballhaus, and a stunningly evocative score by Peter Gabriel featuring a bewildering variety of ethnic African and Asian sounds and musicians. Movies about religion are often turgid and bland at best. Upon this film's release however, both it and Scorsese were vilified as blasphemous by many so-called devout Christians, many of whom hadn't even seen it - ignorant half-wits, one and all. This is arguably a great director's best and most personal film, and it is a beautiful, passionate, intense, intelligent and above all, deeply spiritual work.

He has tried fasting and self-harm but neither have worked for very long. He works as a carpenter; one of the few who will make crosses for the Romans &#150; much to the annoyance of his acquaintance Judas, a Jewish rebel. Following an appearance by a spirit, Jesus heads into the desert where he experiences temptations and, ultimately, learns the path he must follow. Returning to the real world he starts to speak and gains a following of loyal disciples who believe he is the Messiah. However for every follower, he gets 10 enemies &#150; mainly among the religious elite who see him as a heretic and lawbreaker.When it was released in cinemas and first screened on television in the UK, this film broke all records for complaints and also had the moral majority (?) up in arms over the controversy and the portrayal of Christ. Although I don't want to get drawn into that, the reason I think they are wrong to complain is the same reason I think the film is worth seeing. From the get-go, this film flies its fictional roots and never claims to be the gospel truth (pardon the pun). However what it does is to think around the gospel, to wonder, to suppose, to ask questions &#150; something that millions of Christians do every day when they read the bible and contemplate on it. I'm not blind to the offence that this thought process could have but it still provides food for thought and, like the author's quote says, really puts some interesting ideas on the table in regards the dualities of Jesus as both a man and God.Although this makes it worth seeing in my book and held my interest and engaged my brain throughout this isn't to say it is brilliant, because it isn't. It is overlong and rather plodding at times and could (and should) have lost at least 30 minutes from the running time to be a better film. The dialogue doesn't help that much at times but the delivery is good from a handful of great performances. Although most Christians are in love with Gibson's portrayal of Christ recently, Dafoe goes deeper and more complex with a performance where he seems to totally understand the complex motivations that could have run through Christ &#150; he is convincing as man and God and his though process is clear and engaging. He is helped by some great support. Specifically Keitel is great and helps bring out a Judas that is the opposite of the greedy failure we are told he is &#150; instead he takes the second hardest job; he makes it work really well and dominates his scenes. Support is also strong from Hershey, Argo, Been and Bowie (yes, even Bowie) who all come over with smaller but impressive performances. Scorsese directs with deliberate movements at times but he matches the mood of the period that is well set by sets, costumes and the cool ethnic score.Overall this is not a great film and if you have no belief or interest in Jesus then I cannot see why you'd bother to get through such a long film that lacks pace. However as spiritual food for thought it is wonderful and really engaged my brain &#150; even if you (rightly) dismiss the film as fiction, it is still useful as spiritual debate and providing a view of things that you can study out and draw from. Compared to the thoughtless, cold and spiritually empty film by Mel Gibson 15 years later, this is vastly better and worth seeing if you saw that.

No, the problem is that most of the film comprises a biography of Jesus, and fails badly at it.The accents are a serious problem; they're completely unbelievable in this context. Dafoe and Keitel never abandon their thick, urban American dialects; they sound like they're in an Abel Ferrara gangster film. I realize that this was intentional, since giving Jesus the traditional, vaguely beatific aura would defeat the point of the film. Nevertheless, this completely pulls the viewer out of setting -- I don't feel like I'm watching events of two millennia ago; I feel like I'm watching Brooklynite Christians put on an Easter play. The dialogue doesn't help when Jesus asks, Are you ready for me?, he sounds like a frightened patient in a doctor's office.The end result is that the Jesus character is completely unbelievable as a person who attracts a loyal flock of disciples and followers. Is this guy the Son of God, or the head of a stevedore's union? I don't mind Dafoe as an actor, but he does not possess the sheer force of charisma necessary to convince us that he is the Messiah. As a result, the entire film is lost.By the time the film reaches the controversial content, I've long since ceased to care, but since we're on the topic, it must be pointed out that the film has little, if anything, to say about Jesus Christ. In typical Christian teaching, by definition Jesus is a dual entity of God and Man that exists beyond the comprehension of mankind. Since God is by definition omnipotent, the Son of God, who is also God, is also omnipotent, and not fallible like a human, and therefore wouldn't have caved to temptation. The character presented in this film is therefore somewhat removed from the figure worshiped by Christians.So. We have a film that is an inferior adaptation of a well-known story, and which does little to enhance our faith. What are we left with? Well, not much. I might say that the film is worth watching simply to see an example of Scorsese's middle period, except that the film is nearly three hours long. If you have that much time to kill, and you really want to see it, go ahead, but otherwise, you aren't missing much.

I believe that this film must be viewed because it is, besides Pier Paolo Passolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew, the best film about Christ and the best representation of him.The film is not based on the Gospels and that is stated at the very beginning. This film is a adaptation of Nikos Kazaktaskizi's (spelling) novel under the same name. This film holds to tell the central dogma of Christianity even though those who most believe it and oppose the film don't accept this view. Jesus is God and Man and it is important to look at the human side of Christ. The human side of Christ is essential to the nature of Jesus because Jesus overcame his fears of death, leading people, and starting a revolution. How does it feel to be the son of God. There is a heavy burden and great responsibility. Besides Passolini's film the representation of Christ by the church is not accurate in films and church paintings. Jesus was a carpenter and he had to be strong, he is human and has flaws, he possess human nature and desires, and questions his own existence.This film is about thoughts than a biographical approach. The real biography of Jesus will truly never be known and this is where interpretation is created to be the truth. The largest points are with Jesus' relationship with Judas. Judas had to turn in Jesus for the ultimate sacrifice. He is not the enemy as depicted pitifully in Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ but the force for Jesus to bring Salvation. Jesus had to die to save our sins and Judas is the reason for that to happen.Paul Schrader's screenplay is thought provoking through the conversations asking who, what, where, and why. Jesus is always asking questions and Judas is there. They don't find answers but understand them to further God's message through them. This review does feel as a defense against the controversy by the religious right who don't see in the messages of charity, helping the poor and homeless, live good lives, and don't fall into the temptations of greed and lust. Scorsese's approach feels historic with real people who felt that they truly existed. These are not cardboard cut out images from the biblical epics and the blandish tapes by the over zealous Billy Graham and false priests of sinful self created churches seen on TV and marketed to people to get rich. Scorsese's cinematic techniques in the cinematography and imagery along with Peter Gabriel's superb score make the film a masterpiece. No wonder why he is nominated for a best director at the Oscars.Please before you make up your mind on this film, see it first. Its easy to jump to conclusions but those wont be the right ones. This is one of Scorsese's best films.About the Reviewer I am a Irish American Roman Catholic. I do not attend church every Sunday but I do my best.

I went with a small group of friends and we decided on going to the late showing to avoid the possible protesters. We were right, there were two people there holding forlorn looking little signs warning me about something or other.Upon seeing the film, I concluded that the protests were much ado about nothing, and that if anything Scorsese appreciated the buzz the protests generated since this film was not all that great on its own merits.Peter Gabriel's score was tremendous. It conveyed an authentic feel as the scenes unfolded without the music being so intrusive as to become a distraction. As another commenter noted, the sound track may have been the best single feature of the film.Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Christ was quite engaging as well. It was understanding and captured the essence of the struggle that the novelist, Nikos Kazantzakis, and Scorsese were trying to capture. Although it doesn't get a lot of attention from present-day theologians, the possibility of internal struggles between the human and divine sides of Jesus Christ was a topic debated vigorously, often bitterly, in the early existence of the Christian faith. Dafoe deftly captures the idea of an internal struggle -- sometimes confident, sometimes terrified, the human Jesus portrayed by Dafoe wrestles endlessly with who and what he is. Finally, I think Scorsese's portrayals of the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness are quite creative and extremely well done. The idea that Satan appeared to Jesus in attractive forms makes considerably more logical sense than do the traditional portrayals of a hoofed and horned Satan skulking in the background whispering temptations to Jesus. Otherwise, the film was not wildly impressive. Harvey Keitel could have lost the Bozo fright wig he wore to make his character more credible. Harry Dean Stanton as Saul, after conversion the Apostle Paul, gave a decent enough performance, but the words he was given to say in the script were generally ludicrous. The notion that Paul didn't need the living Jesus, but relied on the dead Christ, is an important piece of theological and church history, but it came off too satirical to make the point. As it was, the portrayal of Judas as the disciple whom Jesus loved, and as the most worthy of the disciples, was predictable, even trite. The other male disciples mainly wander through the film in search of a clue. The controversial scenes, of course, were those which constituted the last temptation of Christ. Appearing as a beautiful child, Satan (with an English accent), offers to Jesus a chance to be a regular Joe. Marry Mary and then when she gets knocked off by the Romans, marry her sister. After all, there's only one woman in the world. Therein lies a problem with this film. There is more than one woman in the world, but there was only one woman in this film, and her name was seductress. With the exception of the little English devil-girl, all the women in this film seemed to have getting laid by Jesus as their primary purpose in life. That portrayal of women is not one of Scorsese's finer moments. Frankly, it seemed to me that if Christians were going to get upset by anything in this film relating to sexuality, it would have been the scene early in the film where Jesus sits by and watches and waits while Mary Magdalene, the prostitute, services her clientele. That scene caused one of the little group I was with to exit the theatre and wait for us in the car. This film is not for the theological faint of heart. If you are open to the idea of a graphic depiction of one of the great controversies of ancient Christianity, then go for it. If it bothers you to think through the metaphysical and practical implications of a man being both human (frail, limited) and God (omnipotent, eternal) then this film is not for you.

Well, we saw it anyway of course, and it struck me then and strikes me now that the point of the film, and the book, is rather pious in the end. This is a pro-Jesus movie. You just can't take it literally.So the spoiler stuff is here. After two hours of really bold, vivid, raw, dusty (it's in the desert) accounting of the early years of Jesus the preacher and Son of God, we get to the crucifixion. And on the cross, as he is dying (just after he asks why God has forsaken him), he passes out. And in his dream, in his head, we have a guardian angel take him off the cross and show him what life would have been like if he had avoided his calling to be the Messiah and instead married and had a regular life. This includes having children and the whole normal stuff, which of course strikes some as blasphemy. But hang in there. The realization at the end of this dream is that he is going to grow old and die an ordinary man, and Jerusalem will fall without the hope of a new day, a new awakening. That is, his big chance to change the world is given up and the world is much worse off as a result. He is confronted by angry or disappointed old disciples, and he pulls himself out of his death bed and crawls back to Golgatha and awakes on the cross, accepting that he is doing a brave and amazing thing for the world. It doesn't matter that this isn't true. Or&#x97;from my humble point of view&#x97;this is exactly why it matters. It's a great idea, something to consider, a way of understanding yet again what the sacrifice on the cross was all about. And the teachings of Love and putting away the sword. That's not half bad for a book or a movie. Kudos to all, even almost 40 years later.

A lot of those who condemn it for being blasphemous or offensive either have never seen the film or don't seem to have a complete understanding of one of the most basic elements of the Christian faith that Jesus, while fully divine, was fully human as well, and thus was subject to all of a human's shortcomings. If you believe Jesus was a man, you must believe that he was tempted by power and the flesh, and speculation that he had feelings of self-doubt can't be dismissed by a wave of the hand and a few harsh words for Mr. Scorsese. In many ways, 'Last Temptation' trumps 'The Passion of the Christ' in terms of delivering the staple Christian messages of self-sacrifice, hope and redemption. See it for yourself before condemning it offhand.

Some have praised it. A few have tried to understand it from secular and religious points of view. I have yet to find anyone who's written about it from a truly spiritual-which is not to say religious-point of view. Being a somewhat studied Buddhist and devout 12-Stepper, I found my understanding of a Power Greater than Myself considerably enhanced by Scorsese's portrayal of a man who comes to his own spiritual clarity *over time*, rather than suddenly. William James wrote extensively about the Varieties of Religious Experience in a book so entitled, as well as in numerous monographs, essays, lectures, letters and published articles. His research into how people acquired faith demonstrated that most people come to it begrudgingly at first, then with increasing willingness, and finally with a level of comfort that requires neither effort nor self-righteousness.Though they are in the minority, there are many modern theologians who point to the apostle Paul as the author of notions about instantaneous enlightenment in Christian doctrine. Nowhere in any of the four gospels (all of which were written a minimum of 70 years after Jesus said adios for the last time, by the way, indicating that oral tradition had to stand up for at least three generations before commitment to written text) is it said that Jesus *arrived* here aware of His destiny; what is presented is an awareness near the end that the end was coming, that He would be `betrayed,' and by whom.That He comes to see the necessity of His assignment from God--to bring release from the bondage of guilt and shame about sin for hundreds of millions over two millennia--*is* the point of TLTOC. Scorsese also makes it clear in his speculation that God put Judas Iscariot in Jesus' path to make sure Jesus fulfilled Papa's obligation. Does the Bible suggest anything remotely contrary to this view? Scorsese's Jesus prays for God to `If it be Thy will, take this thing from me.' Does the Bible suggest anything remotely contrary to that, either?Most critics, professional and amateur, friendly and hostile, focus on Jesus' sexual moment with his speculative spouse, but the book and film pay greater attention to the man who followed the Devil's subtle seduction into an honest, forthright, middle-class, familial existence which was certainly no descent into moral hell, though it *was* a diversion from Jesus designated *purpose* here. What's significant about that is the home-hitting metaphor it offers for the not-so-awful, but nonetheless materialistic--and very much non-spiritual--middle-class family lives most of us lead in the modern world. Who are we to cast any stones?Orthodox Christians took issue with the author's speculations about Jesus' `identity crisis' and His passages through several diverse self-identifications. Given the actual events going on in Roman Judea at the time, they are all within the realm of possibility. Beyond that, however, is the orthodox notion that no one should veer from dogma in any fashion. Does that conform to the principles of love and tolerance Jesus reportedly taught?TLTOC is a *speculation*; it's neither propaganda nor hostility aimed at orthodoxy. And as such, it advances ideas into the framework of Christianity which are both underpinned by modern research of the early Roman Occupation period and by widely accepted notions from religious traditions which considerably pre-date that period... ideas delivered to us by the same Essene Jews who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls.Finally, those who attack the film on the notion that Christ is portrayed as anything other than the pre-ordained Messiah must have seen some other film. or, more likely, not seen this one at all. That they wish to believe their idea that Christ happily and unerringly pursued his destiny is fine. That they wish to force that idea upon others to the exclusion of other *possibilities* is nothing more than intellectual fascism.Herbert Spencer said, `There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance-that principle is contempt prior to investigation.'

From the get-go, the moviemakers warn the audience that this isn't a familiar look at the lovable messiah, but a glimpse into a soul tortured by the ultimate responsibility.  The aspect of a mortal Christ is one familiar to Christians - he was both man and God at once.  And yet, through the Bible, church sermons, and even other movies he rarely shows doubt, never gives temptation a second thought, and gladly offers his life.  To compare his life to our own is almost blasphemy, but if he was a human, then he experienced what we all do - lust, depression, confusion, regret, and all of the emotions and temptations that come with life.William Dafoe plays a conflicted Jesus, one struggling with what he is and what God wants with him.  Never is the message fully revealed to him - at first he fights with what he is, then he preaches the power of love, then he speaks of baptism the world with fire.  Only at the end does he realize his Father's plan for him to be the sacrifice, but even then he is tempted - the last temptation itself is incredible in it's simplicity.  Dafoe wouldn't suit the archetypical messiah by any means, but that isn't what this movie is about.  Harvey Keitel is one of my favorite actors, and he shines as the apostle Judas.  As a member of the Zealots, Judas wishes to destroy the Romans and waits for the messiah to lead the Jews in military victory over their enemies.  Where Jesus preached love, Judas thought him an idealistic fool.  But he followed him nonetheless, and he is a tremendous counterbalance to Jesus - always sure in his convictions, no matter what they are.One of the most controversial aspects of the film in my opinion is Judas being shown in such a kind light, but opponents of the film focused more on the sections dealing with Jesus's temptations, especially some including Mary Magdaline.  This didn't bother me - if Jesus was a man, then he would have had feelings that all men have.  He would have wanted love, a family, the chance to lead a normal life; of course, leading a normal life was the only thing denied him.This movie was made to raise eyebrows, and apparently succeeded.  I find myself a fairly liberal guy, but even I was surprised at what Scorcese dared to do in his treatment of the Son of God.  It is a humble epic (created at a cost of only seven millions dollars total) with quite a heavy subject.  It certainly is not for everyone.  But one of the apostles (I forget which) and Paul both say something similar within the movie - even if words aren't true, they are important if people believe them.  That's how I feel about Christianity.  What is more compelling; a knowing Lord who comes to us and dies without troubles, or a man from among us who is tortured from within and without and still makes the right decision?So feel free to hate this movie.  Enjoy it.  Tolerate it.  But before you denounce it, see it.  Watch the whole thing without comment, then make your decision at the end.  I liked it, but you certainly don't have to, not when it deals with such a sensitive subject.  Just remember that Jesus was decried by the religious groups of his time, too.  Two thousand years later, we're talking about him, not the Pharisee.

Praise must also be given to David Bowie who did an admirable job as Pilate and portrayed the arrogance of Rome extremely well it was also quite ironic that in the film christ was crucified for the same reasons people tried to ban the film for, making people think.The score is excelent and I am no Gabriel fan.Of particular interest to me was the wedding scene.

As can be seen by anyone who has actually watched The Last Temptation of Christ, this is a misunderstanding of its message. Director Martin Scorsese, for whom this was a cherished project, is a Catholic, as was the man upon whose novel the movie is based Nikos Kazantzikos, and the story aims to explore and clarify the nature of Christ and his sacrifice. Besides, maybe the pictures fundamentalist critics should be a little more positive about its impact upon audiences. I am an atheist; this is the only one of the many pictures of the Jesus myth that has moved me emotionally.Aside from its content, The Last Temptation of Christ is a profoundly beautiful piece of cinema. I normally find Scorsese's style as a director rather distracting and excessive, but here he is simply note perfect, orchestrating the picture with sensitive rhythm and delicate control. In the opening scenes we are introduced to a young Jesus troubled by the voice of God. The camera is prowling, moody, somewhat detached from the setting. Then Judas bursts in, venting his anger upon Jesus, and suddenly everything is very tight and focused, close to the action with lots of cuts. Finally, as Judas calms, the camera becomes still, the shots longer, and there is a wonderful moment as a flock of sheep passes by behind Harvey Keitel, a visual release of tension. Throughout the picture the tone is set through camera movement, slow-motion, the use of sound disappearing and reappearing, and the haunting Peter Gabriel score. This overtly stylised approach is not one that works well for drama, but it gives this picture a stirring, meditative quality that is very appropriate, and breathtaking to behold.The Last Temptation of Christ is a loving presentation of the Jesus story which shows him to be as much a human as a deity; flawed, tempted, terrified by his own fate. This is not only a Christ one can empathise with, it is a Christ whose sacrifice has an appropriate magnitude because we can see it is not something he goes into lightly. Actor Willem Dafoe expertly treads the line between the human man and god made flesh in a performance that is a world away from the stuffy, lifeless, stained-glass window depictions that have gone before it. The expressions of love, regret, loyalty and courage in this picture are enough to move me to tears. I come away from The Last Temptation of Christ, still happily an atheist, but also having been touched by what is a human story, and not only a divine one.

The result is a study in contrasts, with scenes of extraordinary visual power (Christ performing his miracles, and meeting mad prophet John the Baptist) rubbing shoulders against strictly earthbound Sunday School lessons (Satan, as a serpent, exploding like a grenade when denied).Scorsese's laudable attempt to convey the novelty of Jesus' teachings (on a budget which didn't allow for the usual biblical cast of thousands) helps give his film an immediacy lacking in other Hollywood Passion Plays, breathing fresh air into a historically solemn and stilted genre. But the screenplay by Paul Schrader suffers whenever it tries to answer deep spiritual questions, for example during the now notorious (and really quite chaste) dream sequence, when a visceral crucifixion scene is halted in its tracks so Christ can finally be tempted by a twenty-minute trailer of mortal life.Elsewhere it's clear the real savior of the film is ace cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, whose typically fluid camera-work accelerates a movie that might have seemed even longer than it already is because the story is so familiar.

No, this is Jesus meets Die Hard, Scorsese's post-MTV Christ battling internal demons like Bruce Willis on steroids.And so watch as Scorsese's Christ walks about the desert with a band of New Yorkan gangsters, dramatic camera flourishes tracking his every motion, the audience riveted as this white man struggles to hold back the sins and vices of ancient Jerusalem, which in each case is linked to uncivilized women, blacks and Arabs. It's serious stuff. All it needs is Christina Aguilera on the soundtrack yelling My body says let's go, but my heart says no!Incidentally, Scorsese originally planned to set Temptation on the streets of New York, his cast comprised of tuxedo wearing Mafiosos, until he realized that he'd already made that film with Mean Streets. Indeed, Scorsese's been remaking the same film for decades.In this regard, Temptation is perhaps most useful in highlighting the central theme or motif that runs throughout Scorsese's filmography, that of men consumed by Catholic guilt, constantly punishing themselves for being passionate toward a cause and ultimately sinning against it.In Temptation Jesus wants to be faithful to God, but ultimately can't resist the sins of the flesh. Seeking atonement he then subjects himself to all manners of penance and bloody ordeals, before the film ends in a brutal climax, Christ's torn body lifted up into the heavens.These tics are found in virtually every Scorsese film male characters as symbols of Catholic Guilt, the constant fear of both sinning (Never rat out on your friends!) and acting against the gospel (be it the gospel of the streets or the cross), violent self destruction (You don't make up for your sins in the church, you do it on the streets/boxing ring) and of characters wanting to move up in the world or make it by themselves, selfish actions which require them to turn their backs on the religious codes they live by.Consider Mean Streets, in which Harvey Keitel plays an ambitious hood who swears an oath to both family and God, promising to keep his friend Robert DeNiro out of trouble. But of course he fails, and punishes himself by repeatedly burning his hands in an altar flame before the film ends in the kind of apocalyptic purge or bloody crucifixion typical of Scorsese's endings. In Scorsese's world, there's no running from Original Sin. It always comes back and bites you on your sacrilegious butt.It's the same story with Raging Bull (each of the 14 fights one of the 14 Station's of the Cross?), boxer Jake La Motta becoming another guilty Catholic, flagellating himself as penance for his sins. Here each punch becomes a Hail Mary, each knock-out a plea for forgiveness. At the end, Jake is literally locked away in a small room like a Medieval monk, hitting his head on a wall for all of eternity. God won't punish him, so he punishes himself.Same thing in Bringing Out The Dead, in which Nick Cage plays a suicidal paramedic called Father Frank who feels guilty about being unable to rescue all his patients. Same thing with Goodfellas and Age of Innocence, in which our heroes break the divine law's of both the mafia and 19th century New York, and Casino, in which Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro become Sodom and Gomorra, the two Biblical cities who incur the wrath of God and are destroyed for their earthly sins. And on and on it goes, from Cape Fear to Boxcar Bertha ad infinitum.What's interesting is that Scorsese often gets touted as a documentary film-maker who specialises in intimate character studies, when in reality he's largely unconcerned about the inner lives of his characters or the worlds they live in. In Scorsese's films, the central character is, in a way, always Scorsese himself (guilt for turning his life over to the cinema rather than to the priesthood?), a facet which becomes less pronounced as he drifts toward atheism.Bizarrely, Catholic or religious filmmakers (Mel Gibson, Scorsese, Von Trier etc) have always been obsessed with penance and bodily mutilation, as epitomized by films like BraveHeart, Breaking The Waves, Antichrist, Raging Bull or The Passion of Christ. They're like 13th century flagellants, dishing out lash strokes in a misguided attempt to reach virtue. Compare this to the spiritual films of atheist directors (Tarkovsky, Bresson, Herzog, Kubrick, Antonioni etc), directors who quietly reach for the sublime.7/10 &#x96; Scorsese's Rock-and-Roll version of Sunday School is a fun ride, but it's still silly Sunday School.

So I wasn't confused, disturbed, intrigued by the major modifications of the myth. I saw it as a valid world.Now, many tens of viewings later, one thing I'm marveling at (this time around) is how well Scorsese creates a world in which God is pervasive and expectation of the Messiah is palpable. God is the gluten that binds all aspects of his world. Today, that gluten has dried and weakened, parts have fallen off of the whole; in what remains God is vestigial, still other aspects show only his fingerprints. One test of a truly great work of narrative art, I think, is creating an entire universe that exists as some tangent to the one we know, then populating it with dynamic characters, breathing life into it. Scorsese-Schrader-Kazantzakis achieve this here.Something else that makes this such a unique exploration is how it probes the psychology of God. I can't think of another film that does, at least not as metaphor or allegory. But if you're like me and believe that God is a fabrication devised and developed by humans, it suddenly becomes a very potent thing to question His psychology, his motivation, his weaknesses, his aspirations, his complexities -- what does it say about us? Why is he tempted by a mortal life? Why does he fight his nature by breaking holy laws? What is he seeking? By trying to understand the nature of God, this film asks many wonderful questions about humanity.Those characteristic Scorsese smash cuts, creative camera moves, all those affectations that suit his gangster films so well, are given a new dimension with this subject. This might even surprise the director himself who in his commentary of Barry Lyndon seemed astonished by Kubrick's bravado in using a zoom lens in a Victorian drama -- the effect he claimed shouldn't suit the period, but it does suit the film. Last Temptation is a success in the same way. Scorsese mustered his own audacity and merged contemporary technique with an ancient story, and integrates the two incredibly well. I suppose Zack Snyder does this too, but 300 is an action film. This is a probing meditation on spirituality. Very bold (or maybe he just couldn't break habit).As for the the mise-en-scene (which a moronic film professor of mine once criticized), there is nothing glorious or Godly about it (punctuated especially by John the Baptist preaching in a bleached out, nearly dried up riverbed). The land is barren, awaiting the seed. It's a world in which you need a God to believe in beauty, since it's nowhere to be seen. I wasn't around 2,000 years ago, thank God, but I imagine a remote Roman outpost, with a heterogeneous stew of cultures, races, cults, religions looked a lot like this (minus all the white faces).One last thought I'm struck with on this viewing is how wonderful Harvey Keitel is. The controlled energy of his Judas drives the plot by pushing Jesus to continually question himself. He is the muse.

Seldom does a film come along which demonstrates genuine spiritual reflection or inquiry, which dares to question and reflect upon the age old myths of the bible and attempt to make sense of them in a contemporary context. With that in mind, the tremendous accolades which director Martin Scorsese deserves become abundantly clear, for daring to stand up against the mainstream and the ensuing controversy and delivering The Last Temptation of Christ a tremendously reflective, fiercely thought-provoking and endlessly captivating rumination on the journey of Jesus Christ, embracing the inherent humanity as well as divinity of the figure.It is impossible to imagine such a monumental undertaking being anywhere near as much of a success in the hands of a less capable or reflective director than Scorsese, whose passion and dedication to his cause seem to bleed onto the screen. Working from Nikos Kazantzakis' equally controversial novel (a disclaimer declares the film as merely a reflection rather than biblical truth), Scorsese's most spiritually personal work bristles with vivacity and soul, presenting a genuinely harrowing struggle with spirituality and faith, mirroring the director's own religious ruminations. Intensely controversial for its portrayal of Jesus as ultimately human, and experiencing very human struggles, flaws and temptations throughout his spiritual journey, the film dares to capture the psychological struggle and sacrifices of Christ in a haunting and undeniably affecting fashion. Paul Schrader's sparse script is a masterful piece of work, pounding with torment and reflective fatalism, and while some of Jesus' reflective voiceovers toe the line of melodrama, never before have the guilt, resentment, fear and spiritual struggle of Christ been encompassed with such power and conviction.While the film's slow, thoughtful pacing may drag at times, the seemingly tangible mood of doubt and fatalism is overwhelmingly affecting, using its lengthy running time to full effect. Scorsese's cinematography and editing are sublime, masterfully capturing the arid scenery with a bleak artistry, and Brian Eno's haunting and captivating score heightens the emotional tension to a nearly peerless point.Without the appropriate cast to fully drive home the emotional impact of his story it is distinctly possible to imagine Scorsese's masterpiece falling flat, but thankfully the masterful cast rise to the incredible challenge of bringing such a complex and emotionally challenging vision to life. While seemingly an unorthodox choice, it is impossible to imagine an actor inhabiting the indescribably difficult role of Jesus with more compassion and dignity than Willem Dafoe. Strikingly powerful and thoroughly moving, Dafoe conveys Jesus' overwhelming internal struggle with a grim stoicism, as an ultimately human figure struggling with his pending divinity, seduced by the allure of regular humanity - a flooring work that Dafoe has seldom matched since.In contrast, the disappointing miscasting of Harvey Keitel as the troubled Judas, fated to betray Jesus, proves to be one of the film's few misfires. Despite his intensely powerful and rawly emotional performance, Keitel, with his fiery red hair and unmistakable New York accent always seems out of place, and despite his best efforts, his casting only serves to dampen the film's quality. However, Barbara Hershey is a tremendously powerful presence as Mary Magdalene, representative of Jesus' main struggle with his humanity (and the source of the bulk of the film's controversy) and David Bowie makes a strong impact in a single scene as the reflective Pontius Pilate.In turn disturbing, troubling, haunting and emotionally draining, the sheer visceral impact of Scorsese's labour of love is an irrefutable testament to the film's outstanding quality. With nearly peerless emotional resonance and a fiercely dynamic lead performance, The Last Temptation of Christ can hardly be called an easy watch, but for viewers (religious or not) willing to undergo a profound spiritual and philosophical reflection (and brave the initial controversy) or to simply bask in the masterful command of the cinematic form demonstrated, the film proves ultimately rewarding in a way most films can only allude to.-9/10 "},{"Title":"It is accomplished!","Date":"15 June 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" How could I not like this movie based on the superlative novel by Nikos Kazantzakis?

In the hostile times we live in today, we know that words like faith, God, and divine-right are intermingled with our vocabulary and for anyone that still believes in separation of church and state, this is a nightmare come true as we know these are words that should not be coming from the mouths of American politicians.Keeping that in mind, I was only three years-old when director Martin Scorsese brought forth his passionate film, The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), to the big screen amidst a volatile firestorm of protests from (mostly) right-wing fanatics who had the gall to trash it and (surprise, surprise) had not even seen it themselves.To best view The Last Temptation of Christ, one should look at it with eyes untainted by the political rhetoric and dogmatic procedures of the fundamental Right and Left. It's a masterful work of art and should be judged as such, not on its allegiance to the source material. Of course, what many people have failed to realize about this film, is that The Last Temptation of Christ is a work of fiction, adapted from the novel written in 1955 by author Nikos Kazantzakis.As a Christian myself, a Baptist and regular church-goer, I don't feel that this film is blasphemous nor is it detrimental in any way to Christ's image or character. In fact, I think that if viewed closely and without intrusion from rabid militants, you'll find perhaps the most accurate portrait of our Savior ever witnessed in any format outside The Bible itself.But to first understand it, you must realize it is FICTION, not an interpretation of the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. I personally find it inconceivable that any one person, including Christ, regardless of any divine-right, would willingly go to their deaths and enter the realm of martyrdom without experiencing some degree of hesitation at first (or later), and that was Kazantzakis' whole point with the novel to help us actually relate to Jesus by showing that He too had feelings such as doubt and fear, and that He was at heart... a man. (This is the real offense by NOT showing this side of His personality.)In the film, Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe), is already an adult, builds crosses for the imperialist Romans and is otherwise living a normal human existence. His friend, Judas (Harvey Keitel), thinks that Jesus isn't the savior and should enter politics, as he believes he could lead the Jews in a revolt against the Roman army.Jesus, meanwhile, is crippled by the many hallucinations and voices that cry out His name. In this film, Christ is shown as a man who is at war with His father, God, and at first rejects His mission (which has yet to be fully revealed to Him) and is on shaky grounds with His faith, despite having never sinned. The film strips away the more mythical qualities of Christ's story and swaps them for a more realistic depiction of Him embracing His divinity.He still faces the many demons and temptations that Satan sends in His direction, fights the negative influences of Judas, saves the whore Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) from being stoned to death, chooses his 12 apostles, teaches God's ministry, receives the scorn of the more skeptical members of His flock, and is of course, beaten and tortured by the Romans - eventually experiencing death through the crucifixion - which we all know is the most gruesome and grueling act of murder ever conceived.Dafoe was carrying the weight of a hefty role on his shoulders and was robbed by the Academy in '88 of a rightful Oscar nomination, and Keitel's thick Brooklyn accent does tend to get in the way sometimes. (On a side note, this is a feat that would be eliminated by Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ last year.)It's a real shame that unprovoked controversy allowed this film to fall short of its goal of evoking thoughtful discussion about faith and humanity. I haven't seen a film that's this effective in providing an earnest portrait of a man coming to grips with his life destiny. The controversy mostly centered on a scene during Christ's crucifixion, which I'll detail next.David Ehrenstein, in the an essay included in the Criterion Collection DVD for this film, notes that, ...'The Last Temptation of Christ' is a stirring affirmation of faith both in the person of Jesus and in His teachings. But before that, Ehrenstein stated, Rather than it being a 'blasphemous' attack on Christ's divinity, climaxing with a salacious 'sex scene...' WHAT?!?! Yes, folks, Jesus has sex - with Mary Magdalene - the prostitute!That's the last temptation. It's when Jesus is tempted by a little girl (Satan) and is shown life as an ordinary man, not the Messiah. It's this scene alone that's received the butt of the controversy and many bloodthirsty attacks by the fanatical Right... and a few Left.What they missed, however, is that this scene occurs in a flash, a dream, while Christ is suffering on the cross. But even He is able to reject the Devil's temptations and reinvest Himself in His divine destiny. But even here, in this vivid yet pleasant hallucination, Christ realizes that peace of mind is costly, as he is shown the price of His rejection of His divinity, and this is why He reawakens on the cross and states His last words, It is accomplished.The Last Temptation of Christ is not about the Crucifixion (like Gibson's Passion), but is about His humanity, and how we, as humans, can find it just as He did.10/10 "},{"Title":"Great performance from Dafoe in a well directed but harshly cut religious epic","Date":"20 March 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I'm a big fan of those old religious epics, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, those old Sunday movies with the real Stars of Hollywood. Huge stories, huge stars, huge emotion and huge entertainment, fantastic.However todays epic religious movie is more about challenging belief, presenting new historical findings, and being controversial. For me that's lost all the passion of the religious epic. Strange I feel this way considering I'm not even religious. However, late night the other week I happened to come across Last Temptation on the Channel 4 Banned Film season, and I gave it a chance.Good job I did too as it turns out it does retain a lot of that epic feel to it. There's a load of recognisable stars, big acting and huge stories, but still retaining that modern challenging and controversial stance.Willem Dafoe is simply stunning as Christ, pulling a painfully emotive performance and showing amazing presence when called for. He almost looks like a man possessed, which is perhaps the idea.Barbara Hershey plays Mary Magdalene who is on screen far too briefly. Harvey Keitel is perhaps the weak link here and doesn't perform well in his role as Judas. There are some quieter moments when he brings through compassion and his love for Christ very well, but when he portrays some stronger emotional feelings it does seem to come through as out of place.Overall the story is an interesting one, and looking outside of the whole religious aspect, I personally can't see the reason for the upset. It portrays the final temptation that Satan offers to Christ while he dies upon the cross. For someone who doesn't believe, I find that this only strengthens the aspect of the story and lifts the ideals and triumph of the story and of the character of Christ even higher.It's a well directed movie, and there are some really hard hitting moments, obviously being written and directed by those with a real passion for the subject matter. However it does feel that it leaps about, since this story is just a well visited one there are great leaps in the timeline, and it concentrates on certain acts that are deemed relevant to build to the final temptation. Yet I feel that negatively affects the building of the other characters and the story itself. It's as though it's taken for granted that we know the story and we're only going to be shown the newer, controversial aspects.

It's plain to all with eyes that the film is based on a novel and makes no pretense to be otherwise; it's a work of interpretive art, like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or a Raphael Madonna.  Actually, one complaint about animals in the temptation in the wilderness scene is dead wrong. See Mark 213.  If you want faithfulness to the Bible, go read one of its many versions and stop playing film critic.Also a lot of carping about accents and such.  Once it's decided to use English instead of subtitles, why should it have to be an English accent? Scorsese's point is that these are plain-speaking working class people. Bowie's accent makes him seem all the more the ruling class and sets him apart, as he should be.Those who object to the blond blue-eyed Jesus of Dafoe are mostly the same people who like Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Powell in the role. Go figure. Dafoe looks enough like that picture of the praying Jesus that hangs in everyones' grandparent's dining room to work for me.  He's beautiful.  If you're so keen on authenticity, what's up with that 6' plus matinee idol Caucasian savior in the Gibson movie?  A real Jesus would've looked like Lenny Bruce and probably wouldn't have topped 5'4.And Morocco looks a lot more like ancient Judea than Passion's southern Italy.  Interestingly, the Gibson movie was shot a few miles from Eboli, which to those of a literary persuasion signifies a place Jesus stopped just short of in his apocryphal wanderings, a place impossibly far from grace.Temptation has a brilliantly developed story arc told without the benefit of digital-age tricks, while Passion is a splatterfest with no backstory to speak of.

Being simultaneously both is one of the religion's many vaguenesses, and the matter of this unrelentingly personal vision, neither based on the Gospels nor against them. Though not born with the mark of sin, to be human, Jesus would've had to be victim to temptation, having free will. As the son of God, he'd naturally have instigated the most serious deceit of Satan. And if you think Christ's efforts are invalidated by the titular sequence, wouldn't it take a man that long to understand what God understands? I'm not religious, but here's a film that fully engages me on the figure of Christ. His mission is as abstract to him as to us, only learning bit by bit how he must transform and eventually sacrifice himself. He's acting on the emotions and psychology of a person, baffled, disturbed. He confesses early on that he's not the son of Mary and Joseph but of God, so he thinks this is Satan talking, and believes he's the most terrible sinner. Somehow, this Jesus makes sense, a Jesus with a grave dilemma. It seems more reverent to his divinity to show how tempting human life is. How tempting free will is, rather than the responsibility of being Messiah.The film opens with enough audacity for a whole movie in the eyes of most religious zealots. It presents Judas as morally superior to Jesus, who is collaborating with Roman oppressors. Judas then surveys the entire inhuman process in which Jesus plays a direct part. I think Jesus' hand in this tortuous act is meant to be some displaced attempt to fulfill his ultimate act of carrying his own cross. Many of our wrongdoings as people tend to be mistaken efforts to fulfill what we believe we're supposed to do, aren't they? Or to escape responsibility.What are the odds of a human being obediently assuming the responsibility to die horribly? Didn't Jesus-the-guy theoretically have a right not to becomes Jesus-the-god if he didn't want to pay such a horrific price and define his whole life by it? He's passionately chastised by Judas, as well as Mary, between johns. This gives so much more genuine-feeling poignancy to his later defiance for anyone to continue stoning her if anyone can say they've never sinned than whenever they told me in school. He says it with authentic humility, knowing those ugly insides of being human all too well to be commanding them in belief that he's the son of the universe. It's even more poignant, and powerfully timeless, when this first attempt at a message of love is taken by the angry hoard as a message of death.Another sensitive consideration is the earnest expression by Christ's peers of qualms, even jealousy in his being ostensibly Chosen. Even beyond Judas and Mary's righteous indignation, one fellow tells Jesus that every day he yearns to hear God's voice, has dedicated his life to God's affirmation of his soul, and we can see that it hurts and confuses him that Jesus, who's collaborated with the Romans, who frequents the presence of a prostitute, is the one God chose. This is a spiritual conflict that shoots straight into the heart of the burning questions all people have about God How many people have questioned their faith and often lost it owing to an overpowering sense that their best efforts at being good are going unreciprocated, unnoticed, or disdained by an onslaught of tragic experiences, while people of little moral compass, wisdom or human contribution reap unprecedented benefits, without reciprocating the good fortune as you would. What a bold, refreshing approach to put pressure on Christ as a protagonist, to show him as one of us, striving to be good despite the high personal cost of his ultimate accomplishment. Even bolder to hear him say that he'd give in to any and all temptations, vices, crimes and rebellions, that the only reason he doesn't is because he's afraid. Do religious people worship and abide by the dogmas because of altruistic impulses, or because they're afraid?Sometimes thinking too much about the use of modern everyday American dialect in 30 AD, it seems to lose credibility. But Schrader is neither too erudite nor crude. He and Scorsese subtly tread the fine line of having what's said be entirely of the period and tradition while giving them the most straightforward way to say it. Verna Bloom, strongly moving in her few scenes, gives us a Mother Mary who, emotionally, sacrificed in equal measure with her son. Still, there are times when the we commend thee to our God content of the dialogue being given a Flatbush or Lower East Side texture seems more along Julie Taymor lines than Visconti, Welles or Rossellini. What's even more powerful is Jesus' low-pitched inner-voice narration, powerfully reminiscent of the quiet, intimate commentary of Terrence Malick's main characters.There's more than one way to consider the Christ story. Otherwise, why would there be more than one Gospel? As well as one of Scorsese's labors of love, this is also as abstract as Kundun, perhaps more disjointed as well The images of Satan as fire and snake, the ambiguous reality of the eponymous temptation, import twice the abstruseness of Taxi Driver's final scene or Cape Fear's red skies. Such is religious lore. Many gaps, many questions, but nonetheless infinite passion. Religious viewers will understand. For those of us without religious beliefs, this film is prone to arouse more significant contemplation on the character of Jesus than any other ever made.

His first sermon alienates more than half of his potential disciples. His most faithful disciple Judas Iscariot(Harvey Keitel in the revisionist role) is his most severe critic, who's torn between the rebellion of Jesus and the physical rebellion of the freedom fighters who want to drive away the imperialist Romans. The film ponders on what Jesus had to offer this apocalyptic world, and by virtue ours and does so in the most concrete of ways. What can love offer to a world which as John the Baptist says is filled with violence, corruption, false prophets. Jesus's struggle with his role, this contradiction is the heart of this beautiful and strange film.There's not much else to say about this beautiful film except that it must be seen by everyone and unlike other films about Jesus, it's open to non-believers and non-Christians as well. Indeed this film avoids much of the traditional Christian iconography. From the use of henna, and various hand patterns, the convincing costumes that are bereft of all European influence and also in its various details, like there being more than 12 Apostles, a significant portion being women, Mary is Mary and not shown and sanctified as anyone other than Jesus' mother. And it also ranks as the only film on Jesus to show women in large numbers in the Last Supper.The music by Peter Gabriel mixes music from across Africa and the Middle East with some electronic rock percussion thrown in for good measure. It's a film that reminds people of the little known fact that like Judaism and later Islam(one of the singers heard on this soundtrack is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the great Pakistani Qawalli singer), Christianity began in Asia, in the Middle East and not Europe, certain details and rituals suggesting connections with non-Abrahamic religions in both Africa and the Indian Subcontinent.Scorsese returns Christianity to its roots to make this powerful, sensual and spiritual film that is simultaneously the film of a Catholic but also one that builds bridges across the world.

Scorscese has not approached this work with anything other than one of the most sincere attempts to explore the person of God made flesh.This film has Jesus doing nothing that he is not told of doing in the Bible. The offensive scenes are visions presented by Satan to Jesus as the last temptation of the title, an attempt to disrupt the agenda that Jesus was working to.One of the abiding dilemmas of Christianity is how was Christ's death a sacrifice if he always knew that the resurrection would follow? However in Scorscese's masterful depiction the nature and extent of the sacrifice is made apparent. Rather than seeking to ban this work the Churches should have embraced it for the insight it brings. Of course, we all know that scandal brings viewers in so perhaps that's what they were really trying to achieve!

Willem Dafoe's Jesus is a likable guy, but a bit out there. Basically, in this story, Jesus is a hippie from the 60s. Jesus is a troubled and imperfect man, which flies in the face of orthodox Christianity. In fact, throughout the story I'm trying to decide if he's crazy or just running from God.The costuming is really, really good. From everything I've studied about the era (which is extensive), the clothing worn is authentic.The cinematography and look of this movie would rival anything that Ang Lee could put together. It found it excellent, not stunning, but excellent.The music by Peter Gabriel, former lead singer for Genesis, is good. It's a bit dated at times, reflecting the influence of 80s techno, but there are times it flows very well with the movie.Now for the main problem I have with it. It's boring. Granted, Scorsese is not Ridley Scott or John Woo, but dang! I found myself fast-forwarding through the speaking scenes at 2x so I could read them, but get through the movie quicker.This movie has just enough of the traditional Jesus story in it to be related to the Biblical story, but other than that, everything is different. There's no real interest to it. Jesus is presented as such a weak character, that you really don't care what he goes through, you just want it to end. There's not conviction, but a lot of whining and wondering about whether or not he's doing the right thing. Who wants to believe in a hero like that? This movie was adapted from a novel written by a man who was brought up under the influence of the Greek Orthodox Chruch and who was also a disciple of Friedrich Nietzsche. This story is about Kazantzakis' attempt to mix these two foundational components in his life, which is about as successful as mixing oil and water. The statement in the movie that sums it all up is when the disciples are arguing over the last words of John the Baptizer. When one disciple asks, How do we know the Baptist really said that? The answer given is, Everybody says he did. Another asks, But how do we know? The answer given is the theme of the story. The disciple says, Well, even if he didn't, the words are still important. This would lead one to believe that even though the Gospels are wrong, the concepts and words recorded are important because people believe them. The problem I have with this is if someone is going to base his/her life on something and devote him/herself to it completely, it better be more authoritative than this lame reason for belief. The story is flawed so don't come here looking for answers about true religion. Kazantzakis spent his life looking for answers and if this story is any indication, he didn't find them.

Second, it talks about Jesus Christ who is the most revered by all Christians (which i'm among them). Third, it talks about Jesus Christ with a different point of view (more humane, if u like the expression). The dual nature of Jesus has been distracting people all over ages, but there is a fact that no one can deny, is that as Jesus is 100% divine, he is 100% humane as well. He is not an angel if you know what i mean. Why we suppose that he accepted to accomplish his difficult duty with a total consent and complete satisfactory? without never being hesitated or reconsidering? The gospels themselves declare that Jesus has prayed to God to take the cup away from Him. The film has seen Jesus from this point of view, and we can accept or refuse it, but we cannot deny that it is deserved to be considered, even from the religious ones. This doesn't mean that i accept the film completely. The scenes of the young angel in the last half hour in the film (which are the scenes of the last temptation) makes me yelling, what the hell is that?! till i understand that this was the last Satan temptation that Jesus has refused it in the end and demanded to return to the moment of execution. May be these scenes which caused the audience to have a bad impression towards the film till they understand what is all about, may be because they are too long and with no hint about their truth. Beside, of course, the odd doubted relationship that the film declared between Jesus and Mary Magdaline which caused a large vexation among the religious ones, despite the disclaimer in the beginning. Finally i would like to say, that i'm a religious Christian, who accepted the concept of the film, refused some scenes, but this what good films must make; controversy and more controversy.

It's not truly a Jesus film in the sense that it follows the Bible as it is based on the Nikos Kazantzakis novel and adapted by Paul Schrader. Yet even so it stays close to the subject as told by the Bible with extra attention given the emotional burden and terror of a man forced to carry the weight of the worlds sins. Amazing film, which I think anyone who considers themselves religious should be absolutely required to see. A different viewpoint and it did stir up quite the controversy, but it's the ultimate homage to the Christian religion because it gives a meaning to the sacrifice and shows how horrible it must have been to suffer.

This movie is not based on any of the Gospels, but is a fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict, based on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel of the same title (which I haven't read to compare, but the film stands well on its own).Jesus here is truly human.  By all appearances he's a mentally-ill cross-maker from Nazareth.  For instance, he joins a group of men sitting in a waiting line at the prostitute's house, watching the peep show.  Because this film goes way beyond what the Bible says, and allows us to think in new ways, it's controversial.  What if Mary was a prostitute and Judas was a good guy?  What if Jesus was reluctant, and thought of God's directions as just voices in his head?  What if there was no literal devil at the temptation in the wilderness?  What if Jesus didn't even die on the cross?  Would there still be such a thing as Christianity?  It is through exploring the what ifs that we have enough options to decide for ourselves.  Faith is a personal matter, and our beliefs can not be decided by others.  One should not fear looking at all the possibilities, even if they are outside of the church's traditions.The point where this film diverges from traditional Christian thought is when Jesus is hanging on the cross, and a little girl appears as his guardian angel, to save him from death.  She takes him to his new life he marries Mary and has a family.  One day, he sees Paul preaching that Christ had died and was risen.  When Jesus confronts him and tells that he didn't die, Paul tells Jesus that people need God, and that my Jesus is much more important and much more powerful, because only a resurrected Jesus can give the people hope.  God will give the people what they need, whether or not it happens in the exact way it's told.  Jesus is an old man on his deathbed when the Romans destroy Jerusalem.The music is superb, Peter Gabriel's contribution of traditional rhythms done on traditional instruments.  The casting is good, for the most part, since Willem Defoe makes a good human Jesus and Harvey Keitel is convincing as a likeable strong disciple and unwilling traitor.  I was a little disappointed, being a David Bowie fan, that his role of Pilate was less than four minutes, and when asking if Jesus' miracles are good or bad magic, requesting a trick, I was reminded of his previous acting role in Labyrinth.  And although Paul gives Jesus a good message, his telling the list of sins during public preaching reminded me of a Monty Python monologue.As a whole I liked this film, since hearing opposing views cannot weaken a strong faith.  It's only a movie, although an excellently done one, and nothing can guarantee absolute accuracy (the disciples didn't have a videocamera).  Some things we just have to take on faith, that God will provide what we need, even if it's not as we'd always thought.

Thompson wrote by way of epigraph in his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that he who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man. On the other end of Hunter Thompson's drug cocktails and alcoholic debauchery, but faced with the same inscrutable dilemma of how one should live his life, lies Nikos Kazantzakis. In the heartbreaking autobiography he wrote just before his death (he finished only a first draft, the book was published by his daughter), Kazantzakis sums up the restless spiritual agony of a lifetime to turn flesh into spirit and leave behind nothing but a pile of bones for death to take.Why all this? Because this is not a Scorsese movie. This a Kazantzakis movie. Or more aptly, Scorsese understands Kazantzakis on a level beyond a simple adaptation. Never before have I seen a director translate with such emotional clarity and capture with such faithfulness the work of another author. Maybe not the tone or feeling, how could after all a Catholic Italian-American who grew up in Manhattan hope to see the world through the eyes of an Orthodox Cretan of the early 20th century, but certainly the spirit of it, which is all that matters in the end. No doubt old Marty, an altar boy and aspiring priest before he even picked up a camera and went to work for Roger Corman, connects with the material on just the right level.Executed with the technical precision one would expect from the venerable patriarch of modern American cinema and taking its cue from a long tradition of religious art, be it the Hieronymous Bosch painting The Ghent Christ Carrying the Cross that inspired the famous extremely slow-motion shot (120fps) of Willem Dafoe carrying his own cross, Messina's painting The Crucifixion or the simplicity of Pasolini's GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEWS, THE LAST TEMPTATION succeeds exactly because it eschews the conventions of the religious epic as it was established through the Hollywood works of directors like Cecil B. DeMille and Nicholas Ray. Scorsese and Schrader crafted instead an intimate character study of a man torn by doubt.The sermon on the mountain has a small crowd of 20 people, which enables a personable Jesus to mingle in and talk to them directly, while the scenes at the temple, filmed with the largest amount of extras in the entire film, have a sweaty, claustrophobic quality to them, exactly what it would have felt to be crammed in close quarters in the heat of the noon with 100 people. Scorsese's intention was to give a distinct visual look to the movie that would set it apart from anything else that had come before and he was quite successful at that. Take for example Pontius Pilate's interrogation hall, usually depicted as a lavish palace replete with Roman elegance and rows of armed guards, here becomes an austere vaulted room lit from a skylight - a nondescript place that could be anything and nothing in particular yet somehow feels right, like the library set Welles built for CITIZEN KANE.At the end of the day though, technical bravado and great acting aside, the movie is all about Kazantzakis' original material. Although condensed to a manageable length for the script, the movie preserves all the basic themes, fears, obsessions that permeate not only The Last Temptation but most of the Greek author's work. A man terrified to discover that his vocation is not to live life but write about it, to feel at home not in the company of others but in their absence. But in the same time a man torn by great guilt for not being the son his father wanted. It's hard to give an approximation of the pride Cretans feel for their particular homeland, their feisty temparement, or the unique philosophy of the people that was shaped by centuries of Saracen invasions and Ottoman occupation. Suffice to say that to this day there are towns high in the Cretan mountains the police is afraid to set foot in and you can see most of the road signs leading to them shot full of holes by AK47s (which Cretans use these days to protect their large crops of marijuana plants, not hesitating to open fire at police helicopters scouting the fields for them!). Seen in that light, the shy, introverted Kazantzakis that was fit to become neither respectable figher or politician was an affront to his father.Those that said that the book is more about Kazantzakis himself and his existential angst than Jesus are not entirely incorrect. Modeled after his author and with regards to his own personal philosophy, Kazantzakis' Jesus is a man torn between two natures, what he is and what he must become, the struggle to walk that path and follow his call to the end and the price he must pay for it. At the end of the day, protagonist, author and film had to suffer the same fate. Scorsese's film was banned in many countries and was the subject of much controversy for its allegedly blasphemous subject matter. Kazantzakis was buried on the wall surrounding the city of Heraklion, because the Orthodox Church ruled out his being buried in a cemetery. His epitaph reads I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free. "},{"Title":" If the Power to heal the sick were yours, would you hesitate to use it?

In this story, the Christ (Willem Dafoe) is betrayed by Judas (Harvey Keitel) arrested, condemned and thereafter Crucified. As an alternative, in this version, he does not die. Instead he survives and later enters into a marriage with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey). The story thereafter is 'what if' and there-in lies the new ending to the otherwise traditional tale.

Christianity, of course, solved this dilemma brilliantly in interpreting the figure of Jesus as both man and God. And you don't have to accept this interpretation as truth to appreciate that out of it, a narrative was fashioned (that of the Gospels) that works simply as a terrific story, both personal and political. Martin Scorcese's 'The Last Temptation of Christ', a film of the book of the same name, adds another layer of fiction in its re-interpretation of this tale. Scorcese's film attracted a lot of criticism for showing Jesus having sexual fantasies - more of which later - but it's real problems lie elsewhere. The movie is an uneasy mixture of stagey dialogue on one hand, and cinematic hyper-realism (Jesus literally ripping out his heart, for example), on the other. And crucially, Willem Defoe is a peculiar Jesus. It's hard to imagine anyone following this man Scorcese chooses to have his cast speak in contemporary American English, and moreover the American language of his own north-east (it might have worked if he'd chosen that of the deep south instead) Defoe's Jesus (and sidekick Judas, played by Harvey Keitel) sound like the gangsters fresh from the 'Mean Streets' of New York, and demonstrate little in the way of preaching skill; additionally, Jesus seems to have little idea of what he actually stands for. The film's own ideas on the right way to imaginatively read the gospels also seem peculiar. So we see Jesus (a carpenter's son) working, before he takes up his ministry, not just as a carpenter but as a cross-maker for the Romans (a rather heavy piece of symbolism); while the portrait of Holy Week focuses entirely on the mystical (via an essentially novel plot), ignoring the treasure trove of profoundly human themes already present in the original story.As already mentioned, a big fuss was made by the religious right over the ending of the film, in which Jesus is shown briefly fantasising a sexual encounter with Mary Magdaleene their objections say more about their own obsessive association of sexual continence and moral virtue than anything particular to this film. But it is possible to see the fantasises as contrived and bizarre when judged purely as a plot device. I don't believe in God, but I do believe that the gospels are a piece of moral storytelling the equal of anything written by Dostoyevsky. Jesus could have walked away from his fate as a martyr at any time prior to his arrest that the film shows him considering this alternative only once it has become impossible is typical of its consistent preference for unanchored mysticism over character-driven drama. Overall, 'The Last Temptation of Christ' deserves credit for its ambition; but read Bulgakov's 'The Master and Margarita' instead to see what can really be achieved when basing fiction on the Bible.

In the Christian belief, God sends down his son, or in some understandings IS his son, to repent for the sins of man; however, many believe that he did this also to understand the strange creatures of his realm whom call themselves Man. God, being perfect, never new pain, loss, happiness, or even love as we do. Perhaps in order to understand his followers better - really figure out what makes us tick and why exactly we we have such a hard time following the Righteous Path. This is just what this film suggests.As Jesus, the Messaiah, is being crucified, The Dark Prince comes to see him as an Angel of the Lord. He, for some time, convinces him that he is not God's only Son, and that he need only wish it, and he would be permitted to live a contented, simple, life with those around him. This, when released, caused an uproar in the Christian community. Jesus was the Son of Man - how could he be tempted so? Because that's just it; he was the Son of Man, and human himself. For the first time ever, God new what it was to fear, to dream, even love like His disciples do. God as imperfect is perhaps a much more mature and sophisticated view than the perfect, infallible being of yore; the prospect of happiness, even for a short time, was enough to tempt even the most powerful of beings - a thought that really stirs in your mind for a moment. God is perfect, he feels no fear, no anguish, yet also no true love or friendship - he is, for all intents and purposes, a child, really - a simple being with no true character or personality. Yet he experienced something great the realization of human emotions and desires; the uncertainty of a child who needs his mother, a young man unsure who long he will live and if he will be happy in the time he is alive.The film presents and interesting idea that given his experiences, the pleasure and pain he felt as a human, would he actually learn fear as well? Fear that he would no longer be among the Tangible; that he would no longer be able to taste the sweetness of an apple; that he would no longer know the warmth of a friend's touch; that he would never again smell the clean air after a rain; or that he would no longer feel the mother's love he'd never before known. Given all that, wouldn't he, like the rest of us, become fearful that he would lose these blessings, never to again know the joy and sorrow they bring? Wouldn't he be tempted, even in the slightest, to throw everything to the wind, even the salvation he'd promised his people, just to feel these things for a little longer, no matter how short the time? This film presents a new way of seeing God and Jesus - as a being who came into existence and created All as a child, yet through his hardships and joys, matured into a complex, thoughtful adult.

The first thing I told my wife after the movie ended was That movie was a piece of Garbage. It was a sadistic interpretation of the end of Jesus Christ.  After the movie ended I felt a great empty feeling inside.  I was not spiritually motivated; on the contrary it reminded me of how wicket humans can be.  I can't think of any other animal capable of doing what the Romans did to Jesus Christ in The Passion.I read some of the reviews on the Passion and many people recommended the Last Temptation of Christ.  Today I rented it and finished watching it about an hour ago.   I think it's a great film for many reasons.It portrays Jesus Christ as the normal man that he was.  All throughout the film, my belief was re-in forced that if Jesus Christ did exist, He was probably mentally ill or was taking drugs (maybe mescaline or mushrooms). He might have been a schizophrenic or had delusions of grandeur.  Anyone who fasts for 10 days will become delusional even nowadays.Watching how Jesus Christ behaved in the movie, it's no wonder he got crucified. If he really was the Son of God and had the ability to perform miracles, all he had to do to change the World would have been to show his stuff to the Romans.  I think that if Jesus could raise the dead, turn water into wine, walk on water and paste on a cut off ear; he should have demonstrated a few miracles and every one would have believed that he was the Son of God.  Even today 99% of all people would be Christians including me.So what is wrong with twisting the biblical history a little bit anyway? Last Temptation of Christ is a philosophical movie.  It lets the viewer interpret his own truth.  It makes you think. It gives you a different perspective on what may have happened.This movie will cater to intelligent wide openly minded people.

Harvey Keitel as Judas and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate are enormous examples of square pegs in round holes-they are far more distracting than anything else. This isn't the first time a biblical ensemble cast has underachieved.Worst of all is Willem Dafoe as Jesus. As the actor has rightly pointed out himself, he's just like the guy next door- if the guy next door is a wako. The script attempts to give Jesus a flawed, human dimension, but Dafoe's Jesus comes across in as a smarmy, tortured, and incredibly unlike able Savior. Worst of all, his carpentry work is the crafting of crosses for crucifixion. He even assists in an execution in one scene.It's hard to believe that this is Jesus long before the temptation element is introduced. Unless you really dig fictitious novelizations of Jesus, this one strictly for curiosity's sake.

Despite growing up as a Jew in Israel and having no connection to Christianity, I have long been fascinated by the story of Jesus and the many different cinematic and literary interpretations of it, be it humorous (Monty Python's 'Life Of Brian'), musical (Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Jesus Christ Superstar') or authentic. Martin Scorsese's 'Last Temptation Of Christ', based on Nikos Kazantaki's novel of the same name, takes a very original and unusual view on the life of Christ, and sheds a light on him that is both criticizing and sympathetic, presenting him to be a much more human-like character than we are used to expect. With much help from inspired and brilliant acting by Willem Defoe - certainly not anyone's first choice for the character, who approaches this very difficult character as originally as Scorsese does - the master director does extremely well in creating this unusual version of Christ, and makes him understandable and recognizable in a whole new way. Originality and controversy aside, 'The Last Temptation Of Christ' is a wonderful masterpiece of cinema, and one of Scorsese's most impressive works, standing with greats like 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull' in suspense and atmosphere. His directing and the photography are superb, and he transfers the story of Jesus to the big screen like few others could. Also praiseworthy are many members of the cast - Barbara Hershey is spectacular as Mary Magdalene, as are Harry Dean Stanton as Paul and, in a surprisingly good casting choice, David Bowie (that's right!) as Pilate. Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot supplies a good match for Defoe's Christ, but he really is the weaker link in the bunch, as he is not nearly as original as the rest of the cast. Finally, I must mention the great genius Mr. Peter Gabriel, who supplied for this film one of the most brilliant and groundbreaking musical scores to appear in a motion picture, which adds enormously to its atmosphere. It can be obtained on audio CD under the title 'Passion Music For The Last Temptation Of Christ', and remains a landmark of progressive and avant-garde music.If you're open-minded and are not afraid of breaking of taboos, 'The Last Temptation Of Christ' is by all means an essential. Do try to take it for what it is and not to be offended, because the film is not intended as a documentation of the life of Christ or criticism against him; it is merely an interpretation of that timeless story, which tries - and succeeds - to shed new light on it. Watch it, and you'll never think of the Gospels in the same way again.

I'm not a Christian (and thus I'm unbiased), I am just a fan of Nikos Kazantzakis for the unique philosophical views depicted in his novels. Anyway, I think Scorsese has done something admirable he has adapted a thought-provoking literary work for the common movie-goers. That, by itself, is enough to get him into trouble there's always a difference between those who read and those who watch. Book- readers are much more patient with the revolutionary views. They are more likely to change, because the process of reading gives them time to adjust and re-adjust themselves to the new notions revealed in the book. Just in contrast, a typical movie-goer has little chance to really plunge into the world created by the silver screen. He has virtually no time to re-think what is going on. He may even be manipulated by many other marginal factors such as gossips, falsifying posters, or political-religious controversies over the film. Thus the typical movie-goer goes to watch a film with a certain schema in his brain. Therefore, his immediate response may be erratic and at odds with the film's optimal objectives. I'm sure most of the protests against this film would be relinquished if all agree that a film is, above all, a work of art, not a platform to advertise religion. What makes a film great is NOT what it says, but rather how it says, and I guess Scorsese has been successful in how he relates the story&#133; Even regarding its content, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ is a great film, because it creates some modern plot out of an ancient theme.

"},{"Title":"Scorsese's unknown masterpiece-","Date":"23 April 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The Last Temptation of Christ is one of Scorsese's defining masterpieces, sitting in the ranks alongside Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Taxi Driver; it is an epic, highly evocative, narrative of the controversial and, at times, incredible life of Jesus Christ his rise and fall. If looking at Scorsese's career in retrospective, it is unlikely that the film would be considered one of Scorsese's most enduring and recognizable features. However, whether through absolute innovation or audacious originality, it is an unrivaled spectacle.William Dafoe plays the title figure of Jesus, a troubled man lost in his inner conflicts, who is torn between his desire and the knowledge than God has a plan for him. As the film progresses Jesus leaves his life of labor, moving from place to place, preaching and gathering a group of followers- his original disciples. He performs miracles healing a blind man, converting water to wine and raising Lazarus from the dead. I found Dafoe's portrayal of the son of God extraordinary. His speeches are riveting and incredibly moving; it is a performance full of tenderness, rage and love.There is a point, perhaps a third of the way through, when Jesus walks into the desert- out into the vast bareness- in the hope of speaking to God. He draws a circle around himself, in the dirt and sand, and sits there waiting. There is nothing for a long, long time he just sits there waiting. At this point, the film subverts itself into a surreal nightmare. Jesus is visited by a talking snake (with the voice of a woman), a lion, a fire- that seems to burn from an invisible source, and an apple tree. It is a metaphor for the Devil, what he represents, and is unlike anything I have ever seen before. We are watching the turmoil of Jesus's mind projected out around him, like some bizarre circus parade. It is only through experiencing 'evil' that we can truly understand and appreciate what the concept of 'good' means, a concept that Jesus comes to understand and evolve.The film's ending is an extraordinary rendering of pain and the inevitable descent of man. Jesus wades through the streets of Jerusalem, amongst jeering crowds, bearing a crown of thorns, a cross over his back. The camera glides through the action, enhanced by Scorsese's quintessential use of slow motion and music. It is horrific to watch yet utterly compelling. Nothing is hidden away, or censored, as we watch his hands nailed into the cross and the blood trailing down his forehead. The portrait of suffering and injustice is complete.The Last Temptation of Christ is an incredible film. The tragic story of Christ's life and his transformation of faith are beautifully visualized. The temptation in the title is of a normal life where he can live, love and become a father. Yet he can never achieve that ideal- he is the Son of God. As Victor Hugo once said 'Our lives dream the Utopia. Our deaths achieve the ideal.' Only through death can Jesus rise and become the testament to his own religion.Scorsese's picture is a masterpiece and a powerful odyssey into existence.

At nearly three hours long there is nothing here to recommend it other the main reason I watched it, and that was to see Barbara Hershey when she was at the top of her game. And she's not in it for long. Like most of us at school in England in the 1950's as I was, we were all taught these familiar stories about Jesus, healing the sick, turning the water into wine, raising the dead, dying on the cross and being resurrected etc etc. so I'm very aware of the background, unfortunately I couldn't really make much sense of the narrative here as it's tried to be way too clever for it's own good as cinema. I understand it follows the book which I haven't, and clearly will never read. However, if you are going to make a film about Christ, and it's still a good story, regardless of whether or not you believe all that stuff, which I do not, it doesn't necessarily mean you cannot enjoy a well made film as I did with Mel Gibson's terrific 'Passion of The Christ'. Unfortunately here, we have a skin white Jesus, played by Willem Dafoe as if he's about to fall asleep most of the time, wandering around muttering mumbo jumbo and being browbeaten by a much tougher Judas, played with gusto by Harvey Keitel as if he's just stepped out of one of his Scorsese gangster movies and can't quite make the adjustment. There are long, long scenes when absolutely nothing much happens and for the first half I kept thinking, well, David Bowie as Pontius Pilot is listed as one of the stars so that might be interesting. Well, he appears for about three minutes and wanders off and that's it. I think he must have gone for a cup of tea and decided not to come back. If I can nominate an actor for being top bore in an epic film, then Willem Dafoe wins my vote. Needless to say, Barbara Hershey was wonderful, but that's the only reason for staying on this trip.

I recorded it and watched the first half a few nights ago. I thought I ought to watch all of it before making a judgement but Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Jesus made me want to throw something at the television. It wasn't his fault, though; the material was appalling. For one thing, there is nothing in the Gospels to suggest that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. At least two unnamed women have been assumed to be Magdalene throughout the centuries but this is pure supposition. I thought it was an interesting departure from the Gospel accounts to have Jesus know both Judas and Mary before His ministry began but the depiction of Mary having sex while other men watched was completely gratuitous. To show Jesus the carpenter making crossbars on which the Romans would crucify other Jews is ludicrous. No-one would have followed him or listened to anything he said if he had done this. The naked women shaking their hair around in the Jordan while John baptised also doesn't ring true. The scene in the Temple where Jesus overturns the tables of the moneychangers was one of many wasted opportunities and shows that the author of the novel and screenplay didn't know what to do with what was a good idea. I did love the scene where Jesus was tempted in the desert but it's insulting the intelligence of the audience to suggest that the 30-year-old man doesn't know who he is or what he is meant to be doing when the Gospel says that he already knew his purpose when he was 12. I turned off halfway through as it was such a disappointment.

Not that I had anything negative to say about it, but it did cause an uproarious impact to over zealous religious fanatics who thought this film was blasphemous and an insult to the Bible let alone God's beloved son Jesus Christ. And even after so many years one has to wonder why? What was the reason for any kind of outrage? The reason The Last Temptation of Christ angered the religious community was how Jesus Christ was portrayed. He was depicted not as a patron saint, but as a normal man who conveyed emotions, concerns, fears, doubt and acceptance for who he was. This story is about as real to the person as any other film that portrayed him and refrained from making Christ look like a storybook character, but a real human being with exceptional talents with believable emotions. And it never once goes against any message that Christ has preached about through the years. The opening scene in which Jesus Christ (Willem Dafoe) laying on the ground looks just like a picture page taken from the Bible. When he awakens we observe the man is in excruciating pain. During the course of time he is seen travel around from town to town, looking for knowledge as he remains both enthusiastic and fearful over what God has planned for him. One nailed to the cross The Devil persuades him to live a normal life as regular everyday person, married, with kids and an occupation which he gladly takes in. He eventually lives a fulfilling life as a mortal getting old and happy. While counting his last breaths as Jerusalem is in an inferno, he learns what he did wrong and pleads to his father for his wrong-doing and and to return to the cross and to die for everyone's sins. The humanistic plot point is that we get a better understanding of Jesus and why he sacrificed himself for the sake of our humanity. Whether he was a deity or a human is unimportant, the bottom line was that he was a great service to himself and to all of God's creatures big or small. The primary idiosyncrasy that makes this film more passionate than a certain anti-Semitic Mel Gibson interpretation was that director Martin Scorsese and scriptwriter Pal Schrader took the adaptation by Nikos Kanzantakis by detail and refrained from making it big-budgeted or grandeur. Though inspired by his predecessors from the 1950's he took his low-key interpretation and successfully kind spoke to the viewers instead of just making feel preachy and self-righteous. One of the primary things that turned people off about this movie was the usage of modernized dialect and the obvious New York accent by Harvey Keitel (Judas). My guess is that Scorsese just wanted to attract the moviegoers and to give them a indicator of what's happening in the scenes. If you wanted realism, the film should have been done in Hebrew with subtitles. If there was something that The Last Temptation of Christ ticked me off was the overabundance of major Hollywood stars. Sure they put in remarkable performances, but if they're just there to stuff money in their wallets than that is just unexceptional. Dafoe was an excellent choice in the role of Christ, but when regular Scorsese alums like Keitel, Harry Dean Stanton, Barbara Hershey no disrespect for David Bowie (RIP) playing supporting characters can be quite jarring at times. At least Scorsese corrected his mistake when he directed his next religious based film Kundun which was a career best for him.For me The Last Temptation of Christ is truly right up there with other Scorsese greats like Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, and Raging Bull. The conflicts depicted here are equally poignant in terms of being both spiritual as it was physical. It was still not close to Kundun where the spiritual revelation is in full effect. But The Last Temptation of Christ has enough charm and enlightenment to lure anyone for a chance to see a film about Jesus Christ in more humane form rather than as a caricature.

Written by Nick Lopez (ntlopez@fas.harvard.edu)He must face the greatest temptation; the normal life of a good man. But is it the life of a good man? The temptation is so powerful because it is presented so attractively. In his fantasy- temptation, the make-believe Jesus sees himself in ripe old age surrounded by many women and children, having fallen for the misogynistic lie There is only one woman in the world. In his imagination, he betrays his pregnant wife Magdalene, the woman who has loved him since girlhood, by simultaneously impregnating Mary of Bethany. He goes on to imagine that he sleeps with her sister Martha in Mary's absence. But most obviously, he is tempted to betray his best friend, his close disciples, his other followers, the trusting crowds of Jerusalem, to turn his back on them, to walk away into a lush Eden-like landscape, to escape and hide. At last, this imaginary life of a good man is dramatically revealed as a temptation when his guardian angel of light dissolves in a flare of Satanic flame. So the real Jesus rejects this temptation once he sees through it. He remains to die on the cross.

While others who reviewed this movie seemed to praise Martin Scorsese, I don't praise him, I simply note he did a good job. While some of his other notable works are much more famous, The Last Temptation of Christ does do the job. The film does have very graphic portrayals of Jesus's life. The scene in which Jesus is crucified is particularly bloody, as well are scenes of stoning and and whipping. However, accurate or not, this does portray the struggles and qualms that Jesus had to deal with and overcome in his life. This could be a subject of controversy for many devout religious Christians, who see him as a divine figure. The film does seem to portray Jesus as a sometimes not brave, and even scared person, who is not ready to accept his fate and duty. Other controversies included Jesus and his life before and even during his days when he has become a Messiah. Jesus is tempted many times throughout the movie; sexually and with other themes of money and greed. While the film, I felt, does do a good job of relating to the Bible, there is a scene towards the end of the book, which I felt could potentially (and later I found out did) offend a lot of people. The scene includes Jesus, dying on the cross, in a state of altered reality, dreaming what his life could have been like had he just lived his normal life. While it portrays his life of raising kids, the particular scene in mind shows and implies him having sex with another lady that was not his wife. I knew this would be a problem, as adultery and abstinence are both huge beliefs in Christian society. I personally felt this was somewhat offensive to Jesus, as he is a major holy figure in the entire religion of Christianity. However, any movie will have to have its extra details, just to add more interest. Overall, the movie was very powerful, and had a lasting image on me. Jesus is viewed as a person who is capable of making mistakes, which I personally liked, due to the fact that we live in a imperfect world. Scorsese does a good job with the character development of Jesus, as he grows from someone who is not ready to accept his fate to someone who embraces it. The movie is not for everyone, especially if you stick closely to the Bible and view Jesus as a perfect man. A great movie, would recommend to people who like Scorsese's other films.

So the film is weird for me.On one hand I see it for the fantastic film it is, structure, editing, direction, acting, cinematography, production design all top notch. And while most biblical movies take the traditional route and leave Jesus as merely one note, this one offers the struggle of a man coping with his divinity. Which is what makes it so great, but therein lies the problem.On the other hand, having grown up a believer surrounded by other believers (my best friend was the pastors son and daughter), I completely understand way any Christian could, and actually should be offended by it(despite the disclaimer). What makes Christians Christians is Christ, and to question his divinity, in any way shape or for is blasphemy. Thinking of Jesus as half man and half god is not the way, he is all man, he is all god.So while many non Christians will scoff at a Christian who says they're offended, they do have a point. While portraying Jesus as a reformed man who struggled to become god, who thought about embracing the devil, who yearned for normalcy made a much better film, it is still pretty blasphemous for a believer.

I remember having to force my way through a long picket line of enraged Christians who were offended by the prospect of showing Jesus screwing Mary Magdalene.The movie was tastefully done, if not lavish, because it evidently was restricted financially by the studio--most likely from fear of how the general public might reject it. However, the production was profoundly interesting and had a tribal feel to it (with the drumming and the tattoos seen on many of the female characters).Willem Dafoe played Jesus very effectively, and the other cast members also acquitted their parts well. A surprise came in the form of rock star David Bowie as Pontius Pilate, but he also seemed the patrician Roman. The sets were few and simple, the costumes appropriate. It was odd that filming the movie contained several long shots superimposed over other shots that were a little too jerky in movement. I found the sound effects at the end very jarring and uncomfortable to listen to, but they didn't last long enough to be really annoying. This merely seemed an unnecessary tactic. The scenes during the temptations in the desert were somewhat off-putting, especially the plumes of fire which suddenly appeared shooting out of the earth and seemed so 1980s in design and out of place in an ancient biblical tale.As for the sex scene, so over-emphasized by the crowds in the picket line, it was tastefully handled and lasted only a few seconds at best and showed nothing to inspire such objection. After all, this entire version was only a temptation, as per the title of the film. Every other movie I have scene of the crucifixion of Jesus contained the same reference to Jesus being tempted to fore go the entire ordeal. After all, isn't Jesus a mixture of divine and human by birth? So why would he not have the same temptations as any other human? And, in this version of the last days of Christ's life, Jesus was legally married to Magdalene, so why would they not have a wedding night?To my way of thinking, this temptation only showed him to be stronger in his final resolve to fulfill his destiny. Those who staunchly refused to see this remarkable movie, simply because of a 30 second long scene, missed out on a thought-provoking story.For the full-frontal nudity (by Jesus and Mary Magdalene, as well as the throng at the river Jordan baptism scene), this is a little too mature for young children, but is appropriate for most teens. Watch this movie with an open mind and reserve your opinion until the final scene has played out, and I believe you will find is a compelling and worthwhile couple of hours, with little harm done. "},{"Title":"A message of hope not in truth but in faith","Date":"24 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I suspect that this book is a very hard book to turn into a film, in particular with the hallucination that Jesus has at the end of the film where he comes down from the cross and lives his life as a good man. The problem with this is that it is difficult to portray this section of the film as an hallucination, and thus when we get to the final scene where he repents, it feels as if time is suddenly rewound and that he gets to change the decision that he originally made (or appeared to make) and that is to come down off of the cross.We are all probably aware that when this film was released there was a huge amount of controversy over the film, namely coming from a segment of society that really did not understand what Kazantzakis was exploring, and they simply took the film at face value. This to me is not surprising since the segment of society that were outraged at this film tends to also read the entire bible literally and sit down and try to map out future events based upon the books of Revelation and Daniel. There particular people simply do not understand allegory, and would not see allegory even if it smacked them in the face.However, this film is not a Christian film, it is a gnostic film. The reason I say that is because it deals with the struggle between the spirit and the flesh, and this is outlined right at the beginning of the film. The story uses the life of Christ to explore this struggle. The idea is that that which is of the spirit is good and that which is of the flesh is evil, and as such anything pertaining to the flesh, and in turn, to the physical world, exists to drag us away from the purity of the spirit. Thus, to reach enlightenment, one must reject the physical and embrace the spiritual.The bible does not necessarily see things that way at the bible sees the spiritual and the physical world as being intertwined and evil exists both in the spiritual and physical world, in the same way the goodness also exists in both realms. The biblical view of marriage and of sex is that it is a good thing that should be embraced, but not to the point that it overwhelms our lives and distracts us from the spiritual. In the same way the one should not wonder around rejecting the physical and focusing on the spiritual because in the end one loses connection with humanity and the world, and thus is no good for anybody.While the main focus of the film is the temptation that Christ experiences on the cross, which is the last temptation (and the bible does have him tempted in that way when the crowds cry out to him to come down from the cross and prove that he is the Son of God), the lead up to this scene has him experiencing numerous temptations as well. For instance there is the temptation to become a political leader as opposed to a spiritual leader, and this temptation takes the form of Judas throughout the film.What we also have in this film is that Jesus does not know or understand his destiny at the beginning. In a way Jesus journeys from being a simply man who does a despicable job, to becoming the Son of God. He actually does not realise that his destiny is the cross until he actually comes closer to the cross. Granted, he begins making crosses for the Romans, but that is a reflection of his destiny that he does not understand. Further, he begins by asking forgiveness for his sins namely because he does not understand his nature and who he is. We see this journey as he tries various means, to come to an understanding of what his destiny is, and even angers Judas by repeatedly changing his mind.I guess this film is very much reflective of our own journeys through life, whether we be Christian or not. It is interesting that when Jesus meets with Paul near the end and rebukes him for his lies, Paul simply responds that the truth is irrelevant and it really comes down to what people want to believe, The reality of the death and resurrection is actually irrelevant because what people want is hope and what the resurrection offers is hope. Those who go around attacking and destroying Christianity really have no hope and are only doing that to take hope away from people. In the end we spend our time (or even waste our time) arguing for the reality of the resurrection, when in the end it is irrelevant &#x96; if somebody wants to believe then they will believe whether it is true or not.It reminds me of some of my experiences in church. My faith not only gives me hope, it also gives me freedom. In the end that freedom does not come through the reality of the resurrection, but it comes through the fact that I have faith and that I trust God at his word. However, there are many inside the church and out that want to take that hope and that freedom away from you, and they will try to undermine you at every corner to try and do that. The thing is that we simply cannot let them do that because the reason they are doing that is because they are jealous that they do not have the hope or the freedom that you have.

The production of this film came to a stop because of some protests and it almost cannot see the daylight. You will appreciate this film as it brings the viewer to look at Jesus Chirst in a different angle. One can feel the pain that Jesus had, the moment he was carrying the cross and finally nailed to it. Willem Dafore was like made to play the role of Jesus in this film. The Last Temptation of Christ is a human story as well as a story of faith. I am sure that this film will be viewed by generations after generations and a test of individual openiness.

The guy is one of the best, if not THE BEST,mainstream directors in film today. Everything he touches just seems to work. It's is hard to believe, but by this time last year, I had only seen one of of his films(for those of you wondering, it was, of course,Goodfellas). Now, in just the last four months, I have seen Raging Bull,Aviator,Casino,Hugo,Cape Fear,King of Comedy,Mean Streets,Shutter Island,Departed,Taxi Driver,and of course, the subject of this review,The Last Temptation of Christ.Now,before we start this review, let's address two thingsone,I'm a Christian, and twothis film is not based on the Bible. This is based on a fictional book that is all hypothetical. I am a open minded Christian, so this approach didn't bother me much. But I understand this approach isn't exactly very popular, so I hope this review will help you in making a decision to see this film on not.So, on with the review.The Last Temptation is the story of Christ, but as you have never seen it before. In this variation of the story, Jesus(Wilem Dafoe)is a carpenter who is tortured by thoughts of a darker kind. He is unsure exactly of where these thoughts and desires are originating fromGod or Satan. In order to get God to leave him alone, Jesus builds crosses from the Romans to crucify the rebel Jews, and because of this, Jesus is seen as a traitor by his fellow people, including Judas Iscariot(Harvey Keitel) and Mary Madaglene(Barbara Hershey),a woman he once had a brief relationship with, but has since become a prostitute.One day,Jesus gets fed up with the conflicting thoughts and voices, and so, he decides to go into the desert where he hopes God will make himself known to him. After a brief encounter with Satan, who tempts him with the desire to have a wife and children,Jesus calls out to God to save him,and God grants him salvation. Because of this, Jesus accepts his role as the Son of God, and begins to form the origins of Christanity. Although the final destination of the path Jesus is on remains unclear, in time more and more of his ultimate fate is finally revealed, as Jesus learns he is to die on the cross for humanity's sins.Eventually, Jesus does end up on the cross, and this is where he confronted with his final temptationwhether to give up dying on the cross to save humanity for a wife and children or fulfilling his role as the savior of mankind. What follows is one of the most profound, spiritual, and most heartfelt scenes I have ever seen, but I prefer to let you see the scene for yourself. My description of the scene won't do it justice.What a movie! What a cast! Dafoe has always been a terrific actor, but he is incredible here and he brings the movie to another level just with his presence alone. Harvey Keitel is great as Judas, Jesus's most faithful servant(like I said, this is not based on the Bible).I don't why he got such bad reviews for this performance;the way he delivers his lines is of sincerity and real emotional depth. Barbara Hershey is great as Mary. You really feel her pain of not being able to be with the man she loves, but also understand why it can never be. All the rest of the cast is good as well(David Bowie leaves a impression as Pilate), but those three in particular really stand out.Special mention must go to the score by Peter Gabriel. It is just hypnotic and really moving. One of the best scores in any motion picture. The sets are outstanding,the costumes are great,the direction fantastic,.............I just could go on and on, but I don't really need to. When you see this film, the film will just speak for itself.The only reason I am not giving it a perfect ten is that there all some weird moments in it,but I won't spoil them here. It didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film, and it probably won't hurt much of yours,either. One of Marty's best films! "},{"Title":"What did I think? It was... an interesting experience.","Date":"19 October 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I am a theologically conservative Christian. However, unlike many of my like-minded comrades, I am very interested in the humanity of Jesus. I've seen (and nearly memorized admittedly) Jesus Christ Superstar among other similar productions. This film, however, made me raise an eyebrow and wonder if it had gone too far.As a film, it's quite good. The acting (with possible exception of Judas) was superb, as long as one is able to accept the unorthodox choice of accents. I particularly enjoyed Willam Defoe as Jesus (though I had to force myself not to think of him as the Green Goblin). The storyline was well-written and really gave outstanding weight to his last words, It is accomplished. Theologically, a number of things rubbed me the wrong way. You're free to take this or leave this, but I have to say it to give an honest review. Jesus spends the first portion of the movie tortured by voices in his head and is unsure if it is God or Satan. I don't remember if it was ever stated who it was, so I inferred that it was the devil. However, merely showing Jesus blaming God for it was treading dangerously close for me.Early on, he is also convinced that he is guilty of a great many sins for which he seeks forgiveness. While it is conceivable that, while being sinless, he could believe he had sinned, this was taking it too far.I was initially off-put by the overtly sexual content but, now that I've thought about it, I wouldn't list it as a criticism. I would, however, strongly warn anybody wanting to view this about it and the discomfort it can easily cause.The scene in which Jesus meets Paul (in the last temptation, of course) went on unnecessarily long, diving into some weird concepts about how Paul created the image of Jesus as resurrected Lord because it's what people need. In addition to my own preconceptions running counter to this, I simply did not understand what sense it made to portray Paul like this *in the same film where all the things he claims to have invented are true*! For some concluding thoughts, the portrayal of Judas' betrayal as reluctantly following Jesus' orders struck me as blatantly inaccurate, the murder of Lazarus (shortly after his resurrection) was unnecessary, and the baptism scene looked like a rave.All-in-all, an interesting film and I certainly don't regret watching it. However, I would certainly never recommend it to another theologically conservative Christian (unless they were really open-minded) though, for everyone else, I'd say go for it, as long as you understand that it doesn't capture the biblical Jesus.

I wondered and imagined what would the reaction be had I decided to do something of the sort today, just like that, one fine day, out of the blue in public. There would be nothing more courageous.

It focuses on the human side of Jesus, and by doing so it makes him much more identifiable by us, and also makes his sacrifice all that more touching seeing all the struggling that he went through. This is a truly inspiring film, that anyone, Christians or non-Christians, should not be afraid to see. Considering the small budget they had to work with, this movie is an amazing accomplishment, and should be cherished. I applaud Scorsese for following through with making it.Regarding the accents used by the actors It's true that the Jews spoke with American accents, and the Romans with British accents. However, that's not due to an oversight by the director. In fact, he knew this movie would be tough for the general public to handle just because of the approach to the story (he was right), and didn't want to make it any more difficult for the audience, so he had them speak English with American and British accents instead of having them speak Aramaic. Now maybe that makes it hard for you to watch the movie, and that's fine if that's the case, but don't think that was somehow a mistake in the movie.Also, in regards to canadude's comment Jesus loses his virginity to a prostitute in Scorsese's masterpiece, I'm not sure what he's talking about, because Jesus in fact does NOT lose his virginity to anybody. Maybe he's confusing a dream sequence with reality.

I'm just disappointed by the movie compared to the gripping nature of the book.I don't have any name to suggest but I believe Willem Dafoe is an awful choice to play Jesus.His physiognomy is not just appropriate!I'm totally appalled by his grin with a wine bottle in his hand in that wedding scene.(Don't think I don't like his general acting skill's.)But Harvey Keitel as Judas just fits there with his dyed hair color.Plus while reading the book I had imagined Mary Magdalene as a supposedly more beautiful woman.It's just my opinion but Barbara Hershey isn't that beautiful to turn a celibate man on.At least it's just my supposition! In conclusion the movie is not so good as the book.It's a must to read a couple of books(Jesus Re-crucified for example) by Kazanthakis to be able get hold of his world.Plus nothing can justify violence against art.(An example from archived news On October 22, 1988, a French catholic fundamentalist group launched Molotov cocktails inside the Parisian saint Michel movie theater to protest against the film projection. This terrorist attack injured thirteen people; four of them were severely burned. I'm not a Christian and I'm not a cleric any way to give a sermon but let's think about it.The strong Christianity of Europe and (and now of USA)has not precluded this world from getting into a vicious circle.This religion which was supposed to be born from Jesus's love did not prevent two world wars.It has not prevented USA's intervention in IRAQ and killing thousands of innocent men just because of some interests.It's not obstacle for gory sex,violence and murders today.Well that means there's something wrong somewhere.That means a lot people still don't understand the love that the prophets taught.So my last world before calling anything pornography or atheism let's see it in every way then decide.

The film uses the figure and story of Jesus Christ to discuss a number of issues relating to spirituality and materiality. This is why it can have talking snakes etc. It uses the idea of Jesus having to confront his own spirituality as a way of discovering more about what it is to be human, and what it is to sacrifice and be tempted. While issues surrounding Jesus's actual divinity are raised, they are not promulgated as fact. It is a work of imagination, not documentation. In a medieval allegory named Piers Plowman, a ploughman named Piers ends up being identified with Christ jousting for victory on the cross. Those who consider this film blasphemous must also condemn a large part of Christian inspired writing and art that uses Jesus to discuss a range of material and spiritual issues.To those who say that by thinking of the sins Jesus is committing them, remember that it is not sinful to be tempted, to be given tempting thoughts - as the film clearly indicates is happening. It is only sinful to accept those thoughts, not to struggle against them, as Jesus eventually does.This is a thoughtful film, and you must be prepared to think while watching it. Comparing it to POTC is like comparing Heart of Darkness to Amistad, Hamlet to Titus Andonicus, or Beethoven's Eroica to Tchaikovsky's 1812.

The focus on these movies was the miracles and salvation He brings to the world. Christians worship and adore Him as God, but sometimes forget that He was fully a man, too, when He lives in this planet. That was the movie attempt to show the both-side personality of Jesus as God and man.To make the story acceptable, the movie makers don't use the Bible as the main source in its screenplay. The manly of Jesus that shows on this movie have became a controversial talking. But, in the opening credit, said that it was written by fictional exploration of Jesus' life. So, it would be better to see the movie based on that view.William Dafoe, plays as Jesus, looks like great in his performance on this movie. Actually, he plays some bad characters or antagonist in another movies. I think the other character that has a big significance in this movie was Judas (Harveoy Keitel). In the Bible there is nothing special mentioned in relationship between Jesus and Judas, like that told in this movie Judas is so close with Jesus; even He not starts His ministries yet.While I'm seeing the movie, it makes my mind sounded some questions. The most hard-answered question is this Why Jesus told Judas that his duty (that is, betray and over Him to crucify by taking some money) is a harder job than die on the cross to forgive human sins &#150; that was Jesus does? That shows in this movie, Judas was commanded directly by Jesus to do the duty. He looks so sad when he accepted the duty. He loves Jesus. Maybe, the answer is this the salvation must be comes through the death, so the one who makes the death happens, he has done his duty. The duty must be doing, even Judas doesn't like it at all to do. But, I'm not sure this was the right answer.The screenwriter (Paul Schrader) of the movie is brilliant. He challenges us to think about men usually need in life woman and kids... a family&#133; a common happiness. What if Jesus decides not to obey what God has commanded Him to do? Then he makes an imagination that Jesus gets married and has some children. It comes when Jesus almost finished His salvation on the cross. Based on the Bible, the last temptation was not the imagination. Gethsemane, that was the place He found the last temptation to do God's will or not.This movie looks like to challenge our reflection. What kind of self-will-obsessions conflicts in a person who has the-both personalities? Roger Ebert, the famous movie-reviewer write, I cannot think of another film on a religious subject that has challenged me more fully. The film has offended those whose ideas about God and man it does not reflect. But then, so did Jesus. Perhaps, when Jesus decides not to die on the cross, Christianity knows the consequences neither salvation, nor eternal life after death people will find.

Though I'm not a practicing Christian, his life has some magic for me. I liked the musical version by AL Webber, but its plot didn't differ a lot from most Jesus' movies. Always there was a clear distinction between the good ones - Jesus, St.Peter and his Apostles and the bad ones - Pontius Pilatus, farizees and of course, Judas. And small parts for women. I always felt something doesn't work right in these plots. Life ain't thus polarized. Scorsese must felt it the same, because he broke these axioms. The main hero, called by himself Son of Man has all marks of humanity. He does sin, he loves a woman, he collaborates with Romans and what more - he doubts. His doubts are so strong that at his first speech to the Nazarethans he doesn't know what to say. Then the God uses his mouth to spread a word of Love amongst the people. As Jesus said to Judas, these weren't his words. He is just a poor human looking for his God. But the God has chosen him to show his will. To tell the people of Israel, and not only Israel, that everybody can reach salvation. That they should prefer love to hatred. And that all uneasiness in this life will be awarded by Him later. Judas played by Harvey Keitel is another interesting person. A nationalist who wants to get rid of the Romans and to install a real Jewish rule. His task was to kill Jesus but his way of finding God persuades him to wait with the execution. Judas is his closest friend, who is not like the other Apostles (rural people without education) - he knows politics and he knows what he wants. After Jesus 'fails' to claim the throne of Israel, Judas refuses to punish Jesus for destroying his dream. Instead he is even reluctant to betray him. Jesus has to make him to do so, otherwise salvation of the world would be impossible. Apostles are a group of useless farmers and fishermen. After Jesus is captured at Getsemane garden, they runaway. No stress on their further deeds. They are not important for the story! Then came the last temptation. Vision of life with a beloved woman, children and so on. Saul/Paul later shows him that he is not important himself but his salvation and win over the death. Later a vision of elderly death comes. Apostles are useless again, but Judas is his true consciousness. Thus Jesus can fulfill his doom and choose to die on the cross, escaping the temptation of angelic Devil.

When he crucified, he asked his father that Why should I be crucified?, Am I messiah? it was touching, I felt him in my heart(I'm not christian). Anyway it's  controversial movie,that's for sure. However, If you see this, then you more love Jesus.

And I give Scorsese and Schrader credit, for it was a lot more faithful to the novel than I would have thought.  Although there were a few things left out - which is to be expected - the events that cause the major turning points in Jesus are all there, and very few new things are added to the story. At first glance, Willem Dafoe does not seem like someone who could easily play the archetypal Jesus figure.  But then again, the Jesus of The Last Temptation is not a typical Jesus.  And I must say, he does a great job.  I found he very accurately captured the fear and uncertainty of the Jesus from the novel, as well as Jesus' progression throughout the story. I thought Harvey Keitel was an...interesting choice for Judas at first go, but found his portrayal to be very well done.  Although his particular diction took a bit of getting used to - for it wasn't quite what I expected from Judas - he did an excellent job of showing both Judas' fierce beliefs as well as his compassionate nature. I found the sets and costumes to be very authentic, most likely because of the awful budget they had.  The Roman Centurions' armour were not perfect and shiny, but were dusty and worn.  The sets were far from grandiose, the huts looking as though they had actually been built from mud and straw and stones.  Most of the filming was (or at least appeared to be) shot on outdoor sets.  This authenticity I found enhanced the performances of the actors because I really got the sense that they were in Israel circa 30 CE, and not on some major studio back lot. The film, like the novel, explores the fully human side to Jesus showing that, like all of us, he is prone to fear, and doubt, and temptation.  I really don't understand the controversy surrounding both the film and the novel, and found it to be a tribute to the life of Jesus. Although this film won't appeal to everyone, I would recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest in theology, of any faith, and who has an open mind.  Any fan of the novel will enjoy this film, and I would recommend any fan of the film to read the novel.

I heard from Christian watchdog groups that it was blasphemous, and from some critics and Scorsese himself that it was OK, and from my own sister that it was horrible.  I read an argument discussing that Ebert saw images of blackface in BAMBOOZLED as offensive enough to cancel the value of the entire film, but gave LAST TEMPTATION a positive review, and finally was overwhelmed enough with curiosity that I got my hands on a DVD copy and watched it. I've got to say that I lean towards Scorsese.  It is one exploration of the the mortal side of the humanity-divinity paradox of Christian theology, and taken as such, is an excellent film.  I have read much of what Scorsese has to say about the production concept, so the plethora of accents doesn't bother me -- as the various psychonarrative devices display, this is not a purely realistic production, but more expressionistic realism. I was impressed with every aspect of the film, although I thought that it did run slow a few places, particularly in the actual last temptation sequence, but perhaps that was because I'd already been spoiled so many times about what happened in that sequence.   As for the blasphemy of the sequence, Jesus having sex is an uncomfortable image, as is Paul's confrontation with the aging Jesus.  However, it is to the artistic advantage of the film that the entire sequence be extremely disturbing, because, especially to Christians, the entire idea of Christ not following through with His passion, should be disturbing.  This sequence seems to achieve its effect.  However, Jesus talking about having sinned, and making crosses for the Romans, and continually changing His message, are the more offensive aspects to the film for me as a believer.  Then again, with the proper disclaimers -- this is not fact, it is a piece of art, and intended only to explore Jesus as a human portrait, and taken as a whole-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts, I consider this one of my all-time favorites, and the best Scorsese picture ever.  I highly recommend seeing it and making a judgment for yourself using these guidelines, no matter what your faith, although I would use caution as it could be a stumbling block to an immature faith without the above guidelines of interpretation.

"}{"Title":"A remarkable film, beautifully directed by Scorsese","Date":"27 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Where to begin? The direction, the controversy, the film itself? Let's start with the film. The story is based on a novel written in the fifties (I think it's the fifties) that explores the duality of Christ; that he was fully human and fully God. This approach is unique because all previous depictions of Christ focused solely on his divinity. While he could be seen fraternizing with the low-lifes of the time (prostitutes and such), he was always depicted as an extremely focused individual who did not commit sin and never questioned his purpose. Although he is described as fully human and fully God in the Bible, the fully human part seemed to be only a physical description. The Last Temptation Of Christ explores the possibility of Jesus' fully human emotions and his indecisiveness as to the path he should take in his life.**** POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD ****Screenwriter Paul Schrader has described his screenplay as partially blasphemous because it depicts Jesus sinning, particularly building crosses for the Romans for fellow Jews to be crucified on in an attempt to infuriate God. Jesus does this because God's voice is torturing him with the fact that he is the son of God and must fulfill his destiny. Jesus doesn't know what to do about the headaches (literally) created by God and tries (in vain) to release himself from God's influence. While this seen is technically blasphemous (and I choose not to believe that Christ would have gone to this extreme) it accomplishes one thing that few other movies about Christ have been able to do humanize Christ to the point that we as humans can relate to him as something other than a deity whose purity is unattainable. This is the focus of the movie and it succeeds brilliantly in showing us not how God finds us, but how we find Him. Christ's determination to fulfill his destiny is not pre-ordained in this film but rather discovered along the way and this makes his ultimate desicion to die for mankind all the more powerful and tangible. The controversy surrounding Christ's sex scene is ridiculous as it portrays Jesus (through an image put in his head by Satan) basically doing what we are taught to do reproduce, get married, and live a happy life. The true blasphemy occurs in the scene described above when Jesus aids in the crucifixtion of other human beings, but this scene is necessary in the sense that it shows how far Christ had to come as an emotional human being from his initial fear of committing sin, to committing outright sin in an attempt to alienate himself from God, and finally to accepting his fate of being the son of God and dying on the cross to save humanity. The acting is wonderful (particularly Willem Dafoe as Jesus) and Scorsese's direction couldn't have been better. While I watched the film I tried to absorb myself in the story as much as possible (which wasn't difficult) but I kept noticing how beautifully the film was shot. As direction goes, the film is a masterpiece. Religious zealots who dismissed the movie as blasphemy and meritless without even watching it are hypocrites and idiots whose opinions don't matter anywhere. They claim to represent the moral majority yet they're rarely interested in any opinions other than their own and are more morally bankrupt than your average human. The movie contains scenes that I doubt happened (and are blasphemous, as explained by Paul Schrader in the DVD commentary track) but as a character in the film says it is not as important that Christ's life be depicted 100% accurately, but that the message of his love and sacrifice are passed on and cherished. The film accomplished one thing that no other film could have done. It helped me relate to Christ in a way I never dreamed possible and has strengthened my belief that Jesus Christ was (and is) the ultimate hero.

In this case, Nikos Kazantzakis.  How much of what appears on screen is actually due to Martin Scorcese I cannot say, since I haven't read the book.  Whomever is responsible presented a fascinating interpretation of the life of Jesus. What can I say about the critics of this film that hasn't already been said?  Nothing, really, except who cares what a bunch of religious zealots and fanatics think.  All I can say is, thank God I live in the United States and not some country where ignorant and narrow minded religious groups dominate national policy so much that they can get a film banned by a government that allows itself to be so influenced by such groups.Willem Dafoe gives an outstanding and heartfelt performance as Christ.  Why he did not receive an Oscar nomination is beyond me, especially in a year where Tom Hanks got nominated for Big.  In particular, his breakdown in the scene where he begs God for an alternative to crucifiction had me in tears.I speak as a person who was brought up Catholic, but does not consider religion an important part of my life.  At this point in my life, I'm not sure what to make of, for lack of a better word, The Bible.  From Genesis to Revelations, I can't say that I completely believe any of it.  However, assuming Christ did exist, even the Bible more or less comes out and says that Jesus is mortal.  He was a human being.  He grew up like any other child.  He had a trade as a young adult.  In other words, he was not God.  At least not yet.  So why not take that premise to the next level, which is what Last Temptation does.  It more or less puts *us* in the place of Jesus.  An ordinary human being, not without sin, who is all of the sudden called upon by God to save the human race by being crucified.  Who among us wouldn't struggle with such a calling?  Since Jesus was a man, why should he be any different?  It truly is a fascinating premise, and it is brilliantly explored by Scorcese and Dafoe.Not knowing anything about what happens in this film before I saw it, I was a bit surprised by the eventual last temptation.  In an almost-It's A Wonderful Life style vision, Jesus gets to see what his life would be like as a mortal man.  What surprises me is the length to which the temptation goes, to Jesus's deathbed.  I guess I think the ideal Jesus, even in an interpretation like this, would not entertain the temptation so long.  He doesn't go running back to God until he finds out the truth, after a lifetime of living as a mortal.  I don't necessarily think this is a fault of the story/film, but I think it would have been better if Jesus had resisted temptation after a taste of it.  Maybe after Mary Magdeline cleanses his wounds.  Incidentally, I thought the little girl who played the guardian angel was outstanding.  An incredibly mature performance for a then 13 year old.I think this film goes awry in a couple of places.  The first is the nudity.  No, there's not THAT much in it, but none of it was necessary.  Every scene that contains it could have been shot exactly the same way without exposing so much flesh.  In a story like this, there's just no reason for it.  The more significant criticism I have of this film is the somewhat haphazard way that it plows through the significant events of Jesus's latter life.  Several of the events, such as the changing of water to wine, are just sort of thrown in without making any statements.  The event happens, then the scene ends.  Yes, the film is 240, but should have been longer to show the reaction of Jesus.  The reaction of the people, the apostles.  What was going through Jesus's head during and after.  The alternative would have been to cut these stories that don't have much depth to them out of the film.  Perhaps on a relatively small budget, Scorcese didn't have the funds to totally do the film the way he wanted it to, or the way it should have been done.  Unfortunately, that's no excuse, and it does detract from the film.Last Temptation, even without it's central theme, is informative and educational, and I think just about anyone would find it interesting and accessible.  Almost as interesting as the human Jesus is the interpretation of the good side of Judas, played by Harvey Keitel.  A great film all around, including the score by Peter Gabriel.  Call me crazy, but I think one of Gabriel's compositions for this film is awfully similar to the opening of the Dave Matthews song Warehouse.  Dave, care to comment?

It is one of his more personal works and so ranks next to films like 'Italian-American','Kundun' & 'Raging Bull'. It was a project that was started when Barbara Hershey gave Scorsese a copy of 'The Last Temptation' on the set of the Corman-exploitation film 'Boxcar Bertha' (which is also memorable only for the Crucifixion scene at the end, which prefigures the work here or the Christ-pose the young Henry Hill is frozen in as he blows up the cars in 'Goodfellas'). The film was in production and out of- for a series of years following 'Raging Bull', Scorsese made the dark 'The King of Comedy', the odd 'Afterhours' and the misguided sequel to 'The Hustler' 'The Color of Money'. This gave producers the impetus to produce this film- one of his most personal works.Paul Schrader gets the writing credit on this film, as he did on 'Raging Bull' & 'Taxi Driver' (though rewrites were made); as he says in 'Schrader on Schrader' Taxi Driver was for me, Raging Bull was for De Niro and Last Temptation was for Marty.Oh, almost forgot for a second about the controversy, the cries of blasphemy and a philistine intolerance displayed towards this film by those who hadn't seen it. In my school in 1988 the acting-head urged us to not watch this film (despite the fact it had been awarded an 18 certificate- which still confuses me)and told us to watch a rush-released Christ movie that had been delivered to counter the threat of Scorsese's film. A few years later, I was catching up on films I hadn;t seen (having been lost in an abyss of hedonism for a few years) and he told me he thought it was a brilliant film. So, I went to my local video shop and rented it; it is not a film I've forgotten.I've finally watched it again and I believe it has resonated at a higher level this time round; I believe it is one of Scorsese's masterpieces. On a technical level Fassbinder's cameraman, Michael Ballhaus and long-time editor Thelma Schoonmaker contribute heavily- as does Peter Gabriel with his wonderful soundtrack featuring the late Nusrat Fateh Ali-Khan. Can't people see the integrity behind the urge to make this film?Many people overlook (or haven't seen)the opening inter-title which states that this film is NOT based on The Gospels (even though they contradict each other in places and the etymology of The Bible alludes to the mythic revision of following generations)- this is important. The film is exploring what the novel set out to render- to depict Christ as a man and show the gravity of his sacrifice in becoming the Messiah. It is not a pious, impotent Christ as given in 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' or 'Jesus of Nazareth'.There are literary relations- the alternate Christ sections in Mikhail Bulgakov's 'The Master & Margarita', Jim Crace's 'Quarantine' (which I feel is very influenced by this) and Dennis Potter's play 'Son of Man' (which also incurred the wrath of Mary Whitehouse and her righteous cause). Parts of this film remind me of Veronese's painting 'Les Noces de Cana'- which shows Christ in a very human world. The strongest precedent and a definite influence is Pasolini's 'The Gospel According to St Matthew'- which subverted the Gospel by presenting a dark-Christ (rather than the caucasian-European depiction) & used songs like 'Motherless Child'. Pasolini was given a prison sentence for his earlier short 'La Ricotta'- which depicted the Crucifixion; 'The Gospel...' was given a Papal blessing in 1999 (which is odd considering how much Pasolini was reviled). Scorsese has stated that 'The Gospel...' was an influence on this film- and like Pasolini, he personalizes the material (giving character's New York accents, the murder of Lazarus not being dissimilar to a Mob murder- such as Tommy's in 'Goodfellas'). He explores what the material meant to him.The acting is brilliant- Dafoe, Hershey and Keitel stand out- though Harry Dean Stanton is wonderful,as ever. The world is rendered in a much more foreign manner than other depictions (excepting Pasolini) would expect.And for anyone who thinks this looks like Monty Python's 'Life of Brian'- right- both were influenced by Pasolini's depiction of period detail (see 'Gospel', 'Medea').The world music of Gabriel and Khan help evoke the Middle East of the time- a world without white Europeans; there is a more universal feeling given to the figure of Christ here- rather than one that just reiterates faith. As writers such as Nick Cave and Dennis Potter have noted- Christ was a carpenter by trade (the latter has him building his own crucifix) and that notion is perfectly rendered here. The miracles are not flashy tricks, they seem the work of a man- which I think is part of the point. The 'last temptation' itself is brilliant and confirms the path Christ could have taken if he had not believed he was the Messiah- to me it confirms the symbolism of the Crucifixion and Christ himself. This film will lead you to the source novel, to the Gospels and to 'Passion' (Gabriel's score).I find it bizarre that people don't believe their faith is strong enough to view this film- there are some very odd reviews here (such as the one that talks up Pious VII- is that the one who traded gold with the Nazi's, refused to denounce the Holocaust and aided the Fascist Government headed by Mussolini?). The reaction to this film was almost on the same level as that meted out to 'The Satanic Verses' a year later- whatever happened to an open mind? While I don't subscibe to a religion, I believe in higher forces and believe all are represented by the multitude of faiths (Buddhism,Islam et al)- so I can relate to this film in a non-prejudiced way (because something doesn't agree with your faith does not mean it is wrong). The casting out of the money-changers is something that has strong resonance for this material culture we live in now- this is a film that should be shown in schools, to show that there is a higher spirituality attainable for man. Christ here is shown to be a man, with all his flaws and to be more than a man (and I don't mean Nietzsche;s ubermensch). This is a brilliant film that I think everyone should see, regardless of beliefs and one that I know I will come back to again in the future. Finally, the final shot of the camera running out of film at Golgotha is one of the most magical I have seen in cinema- simple mistake,maybe- but as great as any shot in any Cocteau.

It is made by a Christian and is addressed to Christians. I am saying this because I believe that in order for one to understand the full meaning of the story, one has to be very well familiar with the Gospels and Church history. The disclaimer in the beginning of the movie is not correct. The movie is based upon the Gospels and uses the novel by Kazantzakis as a way to deviate from the baseline story in order to make a point.The point is that in order to reach sanctity, one has to follow the footsteps of Jesus as shown in the movie mainly to deny earthly pleasures including the warmth of a woman's arms. The path is difficult but it has been taken by Jesus. Having a strong Christian message, the Last Temptation is not meant to satisfy all types of viewers. There is no reason why an atheist would be touched by the movie especially when Christianity is advertised but not explained. Many people failed to follow the plot because they couldn't identify themselves with any element of the story. The fundamentalists who protested obviously missed the point.Second, there is some antisemitism in the screenplay. The most disturbing quote is that God is not Israelite. It is nowhere documented that Jesus of Nazareth ever said such a thing. This quote is not in the novel as well. Of course we all know the bitter past that separates Jews and Christians. I do not think that such polemic was needed. Having that said I believe that the movie was well photographed and acted. However, the costumes, especially those of the Roman soldiers should have been better. As a side note Criminals used to be crucified naked as shown in the movie. But in Judaea the Romans had made an exception since public exposure of nudity was against the customs of the Jews. So it is most likely that Jesus was crucified wearing a small piece of cloth as shown in religious paintings.

Some viewers will assume that any story involving Jesus must follow the Bible. So you'll have to get past that, because the standard Christian beliefs about Jesus are not the basis for the film. The most important thing to remember is that the basis for the film does not mean that it cannot have deep religious meaning for a Christian viewer.I think if you have never seen it before, you will find that as you watch Last Temptation you will find yourself taking part in the journey the film takes.

He's probably the most talented filmmaker who ever lived, and this is his best film. Rarely if ever has a director so merged his heart and soul into his work and come out with something completely original and devoid of cliche.Anyone who calls this film blasphemous is an absolute moron. If a movie can turn a diehard atheist into a true believer, then maybe the moral majority should question how they teach their subject.

Don't judge a book by it's cover, and defiantly don't judge a movie by how many close-minded Christians protest and boycott it. The film doesn't turn Jesus into  a God-like figure, it shows him as a mortal being, struggling and seeking answers. He is fighting with himself, and trying to make sense of what God wants of him, while trying to ignore what he wishes for his life. The movie focuses on him trying to do away with his humanly desires and concentrate on what God wants him to do. Scorsese does an extraordinary job like always, but out of all his films I've seen- this one is his best.

Had they watched the movie or, better yet, read the book, they might feel as I do that this is a powerful statement of faith and depiction of the struggle between the flesh and the spirit that is part of being human.  In my opinion, one of the key messages of the story of Jesus Christ, whether one accepts it as literal fact or not, is that Jesus, by assuming human form, was setting an example for all humans.  Kazanzakis' book and this movie bring that message forth by depicting the magnitude of the struggle Jesus endured and ultimately triumphed over, thus showing us the way.

We made our way past the Catholic traditionalists and the screaming Bible-pounders to see a film unlike any other. Now, I'm a Wiccan and a Unitarian-Uinversalist, and my opinions on this film have not changed.Jesus is portrayed, not as God incarnate, but as a man with the faults and pains of a mortal. I had read of all the hype and condemnation the film had thrust upon it by the Christian right-wing, but they obviously had never seen the film. Jesus is shown as a man with vision and weaknesses...all too human for the fanatical Christians to accept.Much of the film is shown in very allegorical context (such as the scene where Jesus takes his heart out of his chest), but it is the last half hour of the film, where Jesus is shown what his life would have been like had he not become a prophet, that attracts the most amount of controversy.If you are a Christian, I urge you to see this film. Put aside your misconceptions and sit through it. This movie may very well strengthen your faith.If you aren't a Christian, see it to witness a portrayal of Jesus that you would never see on religious television. A Jesus who laughs, who angers, who dances, who confronts, and in the end, doesn't sacrifice his principles.The casting is perfect, the cinematography is excellent, and the music by Peter Gabriel is wonderful. It perfectly matches the mood of the story. This film has my highest possible recommendation!

It was storming very violently that night, and the protestors outside the theatre told me I was going to hell for going into the theatre to see 'that monstrosity'. I saw it with three jewish friends. Inside, I found the most accessible version of the life of Christ I have ever seen.  Personally, I embraced the idea of Christ relying on his best friend, Judas, to do what must be done.  Judas' behavior (both in the film and in scripture) demonstrates that he most likely never knew the vital role he played in the unfolding of events.  Obviously Peter couldn't be trusted with such a mission, he'd fold in about a heartbeat. Being conflicted about the burden of being more than a man would drive anyone to near insanity, and the film understands this, and explores it. The temptation to be 'just a man' would be the most powerful temptation to someone overwhelmed by the responsibility of being  God.  Luckily, Christ sees the negative side to accepting that which his human side craves, and things happen as they did.  Could any one else you have ever know or heard of be strong enough to resist that which you want most for that which you cannot fully understand? Few can.  Fewer do.  Fortunately, Christ could and did. Providing the ultimate role model.

I'm angry at the narrow-mindedness of those who portrayed this film as blasphemous and un-Christian. I'm angry at those who said this was anything but a flattering portrait of Jesus. There is nothing in this film that is not consistent with the picture of Jesus portrayed in the Gospels. Apparently, the idea that Jesus was a real human being with real struggles and temptations is too much for some Christians (and I use that term loosely) to handle.  Really, I think the film makers handled Jesus with kid gloves. Not only is the Jesus of their film heterosexual (some modern historians have suggested he was not) but the lustful fantasy that was supposed to be taking place on the cross was a fantasy of married domestic bliss - real family values stuff. The rest of the film could very well have come out of The Greatest Story Ever Told. Scorsese and the writers obviously bought into the idealized portrait of Jesus as epic hero. There were so many places during the ministry phase of Jesus' life that could have been treated with more humanity. I'm thinking particularly of the raising of Lazarus, where the Bible says Jesus wept. In the film, Jesus doesn't shed tear one over the loss of his friend.My favorite quote from the whole flack over this film comes from the Most Reverend Pat Robertson. He says the film shows Jesus as a sex-crazed mental deficient. Obviously, Robertson never saw the film, so it makes you seriously wonder about what Robertson really thinks about Jesus.

Peter Gabriel's score is wonderful as well, working extraordinarily well within the film.

The image of Christ it presents is a challenging one, to be sure, BUT it NEVER denies his divinity or his what his life, death, and resurrection mean. It simply imagines what would have happened if Jesus had been presented with the choice of living a normal life - the last and greatest temptation. Jesus here is an earthy Christ - he sometimes has trouble finding his point or he stammers over his words. In short, for much of the film his HUMAN side is emphasized more than his divine side. However, in the end it is his divine side that makes the choice to be the sacrifice for all the world. The greatness and power of his divine side is the last nad greatest image that we are left with.My complaints are that (like Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell) there is no reserrection presented. The story simply stops after his death...That's weak.  Also, the actors' New York accents and all American looks take away from the authenticity that the desert setting gives.Peter Gabriel's soundtrack is simply awesome!

I completely agree with Leonard Maltin's that  this movie is thought-provoking deep felt drama.  Indeed! It will make you think!   For starters the ability to think was given by God himself, and that includes the ability  to raise issues and metaphors. The movie quotes scriptures, literally.  From the beginning to end Nikos Kazantzakis quotes straight from the Bible when he is not talking in metaphors. I watched, Willem Dafoe,  on Inside the Actors Studio and because of him I decided to write this comment. There is honesty and sincerity in how he feels about this movie. There is absolutely nothing offensive about the plot, or what is depicted in the movie.Perhaps some people are not comfortable with the dream scene of Jesus having sex with his wife, which is the case at hand.  What the movie is saying is let's take this to a deeper level, (1) if Jesus had chosen (freedom of choice was given by God himself to men) to marry Mary Magdalene and have a normal person married life, we would not have the chance to be His followers because his death and resurrection were needed for his mission to be accomplished; (2) that he was tempted at every level that we are and yet he did not fall into temptation He was tempted every day he lived, even to come off the cross, not just during those 40 days in the desert; (3) the movie just raises important issues about freedom of choice. It did not affect my faith.  It is laughable to think that The Last Temptation would threaten anyone's faith. The only thing the movie did was to make me think that  Scorsese is indeed a brilliant man who has faith,  but thinks,  and raised good issues.  Faith is not affected by this movie at all.People that who are against this movie perhaps have not read the Bible because the Bible is a thought provoking book, it does not answer all questions that we might have,  it raises a lot of questions. That is for sure! In case you ask how do I know I have read it about seven times and read the New Testament about fourteen times. There are people falling in temptation left and right, from Genesis to Revelation.If you like to think and leave judgment for the judges and the judgmental,  this is the movie will make you think.

What was all the controversy about? This is a beautiful film but it is definitely not for the Bible purists. This film requires an open mind, especially in the beginning of the film which seems to be pure conjecture as very little is known of Jesus' live before he began his earthly ministry.The film becomes more interesting when Jesus begins his ministry and we start recognizing more familiar events as recorded in the Bible. The film reflects a more realistic version of everyday life in the middle east, the musical score adds to the overall feel. This is not your typical big hollywood production Jesus movies that tend to follow the Bible word fo word. As Christians we believe Christ to be both divine and human. This film really brings out the human side of Christ and for the purist it may prove to be a problem but the film does not detract from the divine nature of Christ. Instead, the film shows a man much like ourselves, struggling with decisions, looking for answers. The film captures the political climate of that era as he is confronted with a multitudes of people, each one it seems with different agendas then what he is trying to teach.The spirituality of the film grows and grows as you become involved with the  different characters. My favorite line in the film occurs after Jesus disrupts the money changers outside the temple and begins explaining to the people around him that God is a spirit that is in everyone. When the priests come out of the temple to see what is happening he says to them, Do you think God is only for you? God is not an Israelite! The political and spiritual climate of the film is highlighted when Jesus is sent to Pontius Pilate. Pilate says to Jesus that he is more dangerous then the zealots because he tries to change ideas and attitudes. This was one of the very things that Christ was trying to teach some of his disciples. It does no good to get rid of Rome, if the heart remains corrupt, only another ruler just as bad will take the place of the Roman.The most controversial part of the film is the last twenty minutes. Christ is tempted away from his mission but in the end it is Christ who is victorious over Satan.

The bible portrays Jesus as omniscient, supernatural, flawless, filled with love yet stern, humble, and finally; certain of his purpose on earth.  The Last Temptation of Christ shatters the biblical image of Jesus Christ by putting him in our place as humans, making this film one of the most daring ever made.Paul Schrader skillfully adapts the novel by Katzantzakis, filling it with unforgettable quotes and dialog.

It was as good or as bad as any other place and time.  For once we see a Jesus who is a man, unsure of himself, rather than serenely powerful and wise.  And his followers have all manner of motivation, from greed to politics to genuine devotion.  I have read that this particular era was replete with religious fervor.  There were all kinds of crackpot preachers and prophets, which is what many people considered Jesus to be. People seemed to hunger for something; this fact makes Christianity's success in the decades following Jesus' death understandable.   Ultimately, I believe the effect of this movie depends on the values one brings to it.  An open-minded Christian could have his faith renewed by Jesus' triumph.  A skeptic can view it anthropologically, historically (though he can't explain everything that happens).

It could have been nine hours and I wouldn't have cared.As for the controversy, anyone who actually watches the movie and thinks about what's going on (imagine that, using your brain while watching a movie) will find that it not only portrays Christ in an accurate light, but a positive one as well. The true blasphemy is denying Christ's humanity, which is what the members of the religious right who condemned this film seemed to me to be doing. Jesus referred to himself more often as The Son of Man than The Son of God. Last Temptation gives more attention to the Son of Man aspect of his life, but, contrary to what many said, also keeps the Son of God at the forefront. While accusations have been made that the movie denies Christ's divinity, I'd like to know how a regular man can raise the dead and heal the sick, which Jesus is shown doing.I think what makes people uncomfortable is the idea that Jesus doubted himself and his mission. My question is how can we follow a savior who didn't have doubts and temptations? If he didn't have the same doubts we do then what was the point of God becoming man?For those willing to dig deeper than surface level, the movie raises many theological questions. For instance, how did Jesus' ministry affect his family relationships (on the way to the cross he sees his mother and prays for forgiveness for being a bad son)?Plenty of other religious lessons are found throughout the movie. In one scene, Jesus prays, Father thank you for leading me where I did not want to go. Elsewhere, Pontious Pilate (David Bowie in a surprisingly good performance) says that Jesus is more dangerous than the politically radical zeolots because they just want to change the government, while he wants to change the way people think.That's not even mentioning the downright inspirsational Garden of Gethsemane scene, one of the most powerful scenes in any movie I've ever seen.Everyone, especially Christians, needs to see this movie.

The controversy surrounding the film is legendary, but largely unfounded. The movie is misinterpreted as blasphemous only by the close-minded. And, speaking as a person with a Baptist upbringing, I wasn't the least bit offended by this film.The film is based not on the Word, but on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel of the same name. The film follows the trials of Jesus, played confidently by Willem Dafoe. We find that Jesus is consistently doubting himself, unsure of his destiny as Saviour. He spends his days building crosses for the Romans, used in their crucifixions. He confides in Judas (Harvey Keitel, whose Brooklyn accent isn't as distracting as you think.), with whom he shares a conversation regarding love, and lusts for Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), who is seen whoring herself and resents his judgment of her.The movie also recreates, in precise detail, many biblical events, such as the period in the desert where Jesus is tempted by Satan for 40 days and 40 nights; the resurrection of Lazarus; and, the betrayal, trial, and crucifixion of the man.It is this temptation sequence that carries much of the film's controversy. Bleeding and wounded, stretched out on the cross, he hallucinates, and in this hallucination, is visited by an angel. The angel tells him that his father is a god of mercy and proceeds to remove him from the cross. The angel alerts him that he is not the Chosen One, hinting that he is a regular man with worldly desires. He weds Mary Magdalene, who bears a child for him, in a scene that is not in the least bit explicit, and ages through the years. But, these cause him to deviate from God's will, and at the end, Judas and the remaining Apostles criticize Jesus for deviating from the his father's path. When he returns from his halluicination, freed from this temptation, he is back on the cross. He dies carrying the weight of the world; his last line It is accomplished!(It should be noted that none of what occurs in the temptation sequence is real. The scene between Jesus and Magdalene, as brief as it is, serves a purpose other than titillation it illustrates the natural process of conception.)It's a shame that such an ambitious film is burdened by controversy. As we speak, another film, Kevin Smith's upcoming Dogma is facing the same torrent of negative reaction. There's this notion within religious circles that, any time religious subject matter is presented, that the filmmaker is on a mission to rewrite that religion, making it more secular. That is not the case here. Scorsese and Paul Schrader, who has written two of Scorsese's best films (Taxi Driver and Raging Bull), made a film that challenges what we think we know about Christ. It asks us to entertain the idea that within the son of God lay a man with very human ideals. It accomplished it's goal, and it did it without being heavy-handed.

This movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking and more than any other book, film, television show or sermon made me think about Jesus Christ and the suffering attributed him by the Bible. (Yes, it made me feel his suffering more than the Bible).  Scorsese's direction is, as always, amazing.  Especially so considering the limited budget. Just think what he could have done given the amount of money wasted on Titanic.  Willem Dafoe has never been anywhere near as good as he is in this.  It's hard to imagine another actor playing Jesus ever again.  One of the reviews mentioned that Harvey Keitel is laughably bad.  On the contrary, I consider it a crime that he was not anointed with Oscar.  His Judas is amazing piece of work.  Sure, he speaks in a New York accent. But Scorsese is working in a strange kind of vernacular here. All the Apostles speak in the working man's accent that may not be technically accurate, but has the feel of accuracy.  On the other hand all those in charge have British accents which our film shorthand allows us to accept as being above the other characters.  (Just check how many English accents were nominated for Oscars this year). Speaking of English accents, David Bowie's Pontius Pilate's entire speech drips with the message that he is washing his hands of this whole mess without ever actually saying.   It's his finest screen moment.  As for the Last Temptation itself Yes, of course it's risky and heretical and controversial but it shows that if he didn't really exist, Christ was at least half human. And if he had any humanity in him at all, he would have to have felt temptation.  Had he not, had he not struggled as he struggles in this movie, what would be the point of trying to live up his example?  He would be just another God, something none of us will ever be so why try.

In fact, The Last Temptation of Christ is one of the most lifelike accounts of the Biblical narrative I have seen - especially in the Crucifixion sequences.Historically and Biblically accurate details include the use of T-shaped crosses (and the legs-bent position of the crucified); the portrayal of the disciples as foolish, self-interested and unable to grasp the true impact of Jesus' Ministry (see the Gospel of St John); the portrayal of Judas as a) the most faithful disciple, b) red-bearded (he was of the red-headed hill tribes), and c) an assassin (his name Iscariot is a corruption of of the Sicarii, referring to a contemporary Zealot terrorist group)...In fact, Scorsese didn't include many controversial details that Kazantzakis did. In the novel we meet Jesus' biological (older?) brother, James (who went on to head the Jerusalem Church), more is made of Jesus' epilepsy or possession, we see St Matthew having his Gospel dictated to him by an angel who orders him to lie in the cause of the Higher Truth...Are we to assume, then, that the Churches' outrage at the film is far greater than at the book because the leaders think that people who can read can recognise art, whereas those who watch films believe everything they see?Tim Gulson BA in Biblical Studies, Univ. of Sheffield "},{"Title":"Strong performances overcome a somewhat slow pace.","Date":"9 August 1998","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  The Last Temptation of Christ has excellent acting.

Without giving too much away, the  viewer needs to keep in mind that not everything that happens in the film  is as it appears to be. It is enough to say here that Jesus does not give  in to the last temptation -- the temptation to live the life of an ordinary  man.Ultimately Jesus comes across as a human who is wrestling with the divine  within him. Forget the controversy that surrounded the opening of the film.  See it and be ready to be powerfully moved.

I think this proves just how shallow the majority of people are, Christian or non-Christian.It's right there in their respective titles The Passion vs. The Last Temptation.While Gibson was concentrating on the brutal, over-the-top violence and suffering inflicted upon Jesus, he neglected what would have made his film infinitely better empathy.The Last Temptation succeeds where no other passion play does by examining the battle inside the man. Not the myth, or the legend, but the MAN that Jesus was.Scorsese's Jesus, while undoubtedly the Messiah, is a tortured soul who knows what he has to do but lives in constant fear. Hearing God's voice and seeing his future isn't a gift but a curse. He wants to rebel against everything, including God, but instead submits out of fear. He wants to end his relationship with God, and thus, as a carpenter, helps the Romans crucify Jews. He rebels against his Father, as all Sons do, in hopes of shirking his responsibility to his Father. Scorsese's film is like no other in almost every regard, but it is in THIS regard that the film truly stands alone.Scorsese, like no other director, understands that the emotional weight of Jesus's burden can only be felt by making it universal. No one can know what it's like to be the Son of God, but EVERYONE knows what it feels like to be afraid of the future and to be tempted constantly to throw away personal responsibility in favor of a more peaceful life. It isn't until his fateful meeting with John the Baptist that the turmoil inside Jesus gives away to a new confidence and sense of purpose. Knowing that preaching his gospel is a declaration of war against Rome, Jesus nonetheless promises a kingdom to the meek and justice to the rich. Ultimately, of course, he realizes that he is the last lamb, and that his crucifixion means the salvation of all.It's hard to believe that this film was so controversial upon its release. Picketing, boycotts, even bombings and death. Call me insane, but I think a film about Jesus's dual nature is much less harmful than burning a Parisian theater to the ground.But, what can you expect? Scorsese has always been well ahead of his time and this film is absolute proof. It's only recently that this film has found a wide release on DVD and Blu- ray, so hopefully, over the next few years, it'll be seen as the revolutionary religious masterpiece that it is.

'The Last Temptation of Christ' depicts the life of Jesus Christ & his struggle with various forms of temptation including fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust.When I watched 'The Last Temptation of Christ' a few years back, I wasn't effected or moved by it. But when I thought about the film in detail, I felt emotional & deeply engaged. Scorsese has delivered some of the great films in cinema & 'The Last Temptation of Christ' ranks amongst his bravest films to date. He Directs the film amazingly. A special mention for the splendid Cinematography by Michael Ballhaus. Performance-Wise Willem Dafoe as Jesus Christ, delivers a terrific performance. Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot, is slightly over-the-top. But its Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, who steals the show with an astonishing performance. On the whole, 'The Last Temptation of Christ' left me awe-struck.

That is not enough.In the first about 45 minutes I had some interesting moments watching the film. I am sorry, but it was at times comical to me, which I enjoyed. And there were moments of understanding, the dispute first the body, than the soul or the other way round. A discussion and dispute you can take as a blueprint of disputes of mankind in general. Which concept is the right one, and nobody wants to admit, that you can't really know, you can only decide for yourself which concept you follow.But then more and more the film becomes telling the good old bible story, and than it was no more good to me, more and more boring... What the film made very clear to me, how ridiculous the story is, our whole western culture and civilization is build upon. The dialog and the events make it so much clear, if you don't believe in the truth in or behind it.I think the film should be part of the content of a time capsule, so that hopefully there will be a time in which people watch it and can't find the clue why this story became such a success and frightened the hell out of millions and millions of people, so they believed it and built everything upon it....The film didn't convey any convincing emotions to me. The involved characters and Jesus just felt not really emotionally involved enough in their convictions, which seem to have come out of the blue -  God told me so, I didn't understand it myself at first. But you can't really feel or are convinced that now, I finally understand. ...A quite interesting casting of Americans and Arabs(?) for the characters, guess who is who. Maybe Scorsese should have transfered the whole set of the story to New York. That would have been more convincing, I guess, but would have been a very different kind of project.I finally made it through the film, but not without skipping scenes. If you are not a believer of the story, it is unlikely to be interested enough to watch this interpretation.To sum it up. Without believing the words they are saying, the film was not able to convince me through the images or the emotional involvement/portrayal of the characters (the acting is not persuasive enough).The film failed to does to me what it was set out to do. In my opinion you need to believe the story in advance, otherwise it is tiresome to watch it. I could only watch it with the spectator's thought, that it is really impressive how much people who want to believe something, seem to be able to believe almost anything. IMHO it was a waste of money and time to make and watch this movie, not to mention the waste of the tantrums at the time of it's release. I can think of thousands of better projects to invest in.English is not my first language and I don't have to use it often enough, that's why I hope I was able to say in some degree what I really wanted to.

I'm not a Christian but I still tend to be interested in religion and Jesus himself. Naturally, I'm not going to be upset about unorthodox artistic depictions.Actually, I don't think there's too much to get upset about. The Jesus depicted in this movie is still Christ. Just look at the title- it recognizes him as Christ. God is still his father and Satan is still his enemy. He still turns water into wine. He is depicted as having sins, which might rub some the wrong way. Then again, in chapter 10 of Mark, when Jesus is called good, he replies Why do you call me good? Only God is truly good. It is bold of this movie, though, to depict him as starting out making crosses for the Romans, being branded by Judas as a Jew killing Jews. As well, the movie endorses the theory about Mary Magdalene being a prostitute, which scholars and The Da Vinci Code have questioned lately. But doesn't it send a good message that people can change? Is it much different from Moses living among the Egyptians before he discovered he was a Jew? The biggest departure from the Gospels is only within the last thirty minutes or so, but it's only temporary and it's also the most interesting part of the movie. An angel played by Juliette Caton takes Jesus off the cross in a vision or alternate reality of Jesus. She cites the story of Abraham not having to sacrifice his son. She is played quite well be Caton (as with Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver, Scorsese knows how to pick child actresses). But it turns out she's Satan coming to prevent the act that saves mankind. Jesus prays for God to undo the error, which he does, and Jesus dies on the cross as he is supposed to.In the process, we get a powerful story of a man wrestling with faith, which is universal. Many have doubts, and in this movie even Jesus doesn't know if he is the messiah. The opening identifies this story as fictional, and indeed, it is probably best to think of it as a metaphor. The Last Temptation of Christ may be preachy at times, the Doctor Dolittle aspect with Jesus talking to animals may be a little silly, but generally it is an interesting, provocative story with passion and faith.

You don't always need to be precise with the costumes and sets in that period of time, which actually would have taken away from this story, the story of Jesus(in this film). This film basically delineates the key events of Jesus Christ, as the bible has it, but it adds things that may or may not have happened during Jesus' time. Most of this film is Jesus' doubt within himself and how he is God in his heart-on the inside, and how he is human-on the outside.In this movie,Jesus talks about how he must die on the cross in order to bring man and God together, to bring man into salvation. In the bible, Jesus was tempted, and he did throw things when he saw how the people were desecrating his father's temple, that part of the movie is true, according to the bible. But 'What is Truth' as Pontius Pilate said, a quote I've referred to many times. Each persons truth and/or opinion is different. What is the right way, who got it right? Christianity? Buddhism? L. Ron Hubbard? It just comes down to 'What is truth?' to the individual. If you live a happy life being a Christian, then that's right for you, if you live a happy life being a Scientologist, Buddhist, a Hindu, then that's right for you. There's always going to be arguments until our end of days about Everything and Anything. Eckart Tolle once talked about how most people that argue(one person arguing with another person), most of the time both people are correct in some way. He said we as humans hate to come to terms with that(that the other guy is correct too) and I agree with him on that. We as humans want everything to be right or wrong, black or white and if both people are right in an argument, then that's a real mind freak to us, we like it to be one way right, or one way wrong, but that's really never the case. And the other mind trip is that if one person is very ignorant and the other person isn't and/or they're well educated in what they are arguing about, still most of the time, both persons will be correct in an argument. Of course there's levels of what is sensible and what isn't, but in the end, both people are usually right in some way unless it's something to the likes of a story Eckart Tolle once told, he said, 'If I had an apple in my hand, I would know it to be an apple. If the Buddha came up to me and told me that it wasn't an apple, I would say 'Well I guess even the Buddha gets it wrong sometimes', I would know it to be an apple.' In those kinds of scenarios yes, someone is right and someone is insensibly wrong.So the same applies with this movie, there's no black or white, it's all gray. Jesus is tempted, a lot more here then he is in the bible. In this film he knew Mary Magdalene as a child, then he grows up, and goes into her Place and watches her have sex with men all day. Jesus loves Mary and he has to suffer watching her with all these men, and then not give into the temptation of sleeping with her. Extreme suffering already. Here Jesus doesn't want to die on the cross, he asks his father, himself in so many terms 'is there another way?' Jesus gets tempted by Satan to the very end with a 'It's a Wonderful Life Sequence' that is brilliantly thrown into the mix of this movie. Judas doesn't want to betray Jesus in this movie, but Jesus asks him too, so Judas does because he loves Jesus so much. Willem Dafoe as Jesus Christ? From what we know of Jesus, from the bible, from that time period, from stereotypes, Willem Dafoe is very miscast as Jesus, initially, just like initially you see Harvey Keitel as Judas, and think the same thing, but once you get over that initial stereotype, you see Dafoe as Jesus because he is so good at bringing the part to life. Excellent performances by Dafoe and Keitel. Again, it's all about the struggle from within, and the things that tempt us. Everything tempts us, uncertainty is what we always feel in life, just like the uncertainty Jesus felt in this film. In this film, Jesus' God self inside is constantly butting heads with his human self on the outside, bringing about so much confusion and uncertainty within himself, The Last Temptation of Christ is more a conflict of Person Vs. Person, or should I say Jesus Vs. Jesus. But Jesus knew himself by the end of this film. It was a struggle, and it was a powerful journey. Experience it for yourself, watch this film! "},{"Title":"A soul-opening experience ...","Date":"28 December 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" There's no salvation without pain for there's no redemption without guilt and no guilt without sin, so pain is simply the punishment inversely proportional to the delight induced by the temptation, and the bigger is the sin, the harder is the redemption. And to bring salvation for all mankind, no one endured a greater pain than Jesus of Nazareth.His body was flogged; his head carried the infamous crown of thorns and his body, naked as when he came out of his mother's womb, was sweating thin streams of blood and to the pain's atrocity was tied the humiliation of stones, spits, insults from an angry but unconscious mob, the betrayal from his own. One would imagine that the Son of God, the divine Icon immortalized in churches, would undergo the ultimate pain of crucifixion with a holy majesty, but in The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus is all flesh and blood, extraordinarily played by Willem Dafoe, he's human in the most painful meaning of the word, and at the crucial moment, as if he stopped incarnating God on Earth, he embodied our miserable vulnerability.My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? cries out Jesus of Nazareth on his cross. This is the agony of a soul unjustly abandoned by his father, and as a capricious reaction, abandons his divine power to succumb to the last temptation of being a human. Jesus' weakness works as a double-edged sword, feeling both the weight of his responsibility, and renouncing to it, or being strong enough to resist the temptation, then transcending the organic sensation of pain into the necessary sacrifice that would lead to mankind's redemption. Martin Scorsese' controversial film chronicles the insupportable duality that tortured Jesus' heart, with a combination of iconoclast intelligence and thought-provoking direction, with a genius emotional core hidden behind its heretic surface.No other director than Martin Scorsese has acquired such talent to depict the ravaged effects of guilt on a tortured soul, starting with what I consider his first masterpiece Mean Streets. Charlie (Harvey Keitel) believed that no one could make up for his sins in church; it had to be done on the streets. I guess Marty was a man of action who despised bigotry and redemption, like sins could only be made of actions, no passive introspections or deep meditations. In The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus' prayers are never detached from the reality of his world; he also is a man of action, plenty aware that God has plans for him. The roots of his torment are that he ignores about the plan, he's a shepherd without a stick, he's a guide lost between two worlds, Earth and Heaven, sins and temptations, grace and divinity.Scorsese direction manages captures the essence of these two realities' coexisting in the soul of a revolutionary man. Jesus is also a leader, followed with a zealous enthusiasm by his disciples, and his most devoted supporter and closest companion happens to be Judas Iscariot, played by Harvey Keitel. Judas represents the dubious side of humanity his mission was to kill Jesus as a traitor of the Jews, but he's eventually convinced that he's the Messiah. The tragedy of Jesus' divinity is that it ignites more passion than it extinguish, starting with his ferocious desire to show the light, to fight the evil and the moral corruption that contaminated the world. But when carrying an ax and about to succumb to violence, his hands bleed communicating the uselessness of violence. Jesus cannot fight like men and only his sacrifice would consecrate his divinity and bring the salvation.This acceptance of death is our both Scorsese and our inspiration. Jesus becomes is a man of life, who feels, shouts, drinks, loves and dances, the ambiguity of his relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) progressively draws a line of uncertainty between passion and compassion. Jesus' passion is what both drives his desire to save mankind and what deprives his soul from the divine detachment. Jesus' duality is something that is not taken for granted; it's experienced when Jesus and Judah debates the importance of the soul and the body, and when Jesus' own faith wavers as to depict faith as a malleable, a living form that can rely on monolithic and impenetrable dogmas, the same that attacked the film and literally killed its success.Jesus' soul is often lured by Satan, through the form of a lion, a cobra and ultimately, a little girl who'll convince him to renounce the crucifixion and the film' genius is reached during the alternate reality sequence featuring a Jesus who rejected his duty and surrendered to Satan by choosing to live normally, have children and wives and die peacefully. It's the climactic pay-off of an outstanding beginning, and it works as an inconvenient reality. When Paul preaches the crucifixion's message because and Jesus objects that one can't build anything on lies, it doesn't matter for Paul as long as people listen. But the point is that no salvation can be based on abstractions, one must experience it, and the ultimate punishment comes from the mouth of an older Judas who shouts to Jesus that he betrayed them when he stopped acting like the Messiah, an intolerable reality. Then Jesus implores God to take him back on the cross, his fate and the price for men's salvation and the accomplished miracle leaves a heartbreaking smile in Jesus' ecstatic face, and the rest is history &#x85;The Last Temptation of Christ echoes the cathartic effect of necessary pains in our quest for redemption, the quest of lifetimes, but one could never have the courage to renounce temptations and experience redemption through self-punishment, self as God did to Jesus. Martin Scorsese highlights the purity of Jesus' soul reached after a painful struggle between his body and his soul, while all of us, including Scorsese, would forever live a life paved by temptations we'd always wish to be the last.

Whether it is true or not doesn't matter. The point is that we can all agree it's an incredible tale, fact or fiction. Many films have been made recounting the story of Jesus of Nazareth, but few have been as brutal and as fascinating as Martin Scorsese's take on the tale in The Last Temptation of Christ. It's a controversial film that explores the notion of whether Jesus was a real Messiah or not. It focuses on the battle of flesh and spirit that raises so many of the questions in Jesus' life. The film is endearing and intriguing, as well as being an immaculate piece of art.This is a film where it is imperative that you take it as a film and nothing else. I don't believe that Martin Scorsese was trying to create an uprising with his film. Instead, he chose to explore the timeless story of Jesus Christ and analyze it from the perspective of the flesh versus spirit conflict. It is certainly more than just another retelling of the story, but it isn't meant to infuriate people because it is only a film. And it is a film that should be appreciated for what it accomplishes. It tells the story of Jesus from such a fascinating vantage point, humanizing Jesus, giving him all the flaws of us mortals and making his story one of internal and external conflict. There are certain things within this film that we rarely see in a telling of Jesus' story. I don't want to give anything away but there are quite a few fascinating aspects that makes The Last Temptation of Christ an exquisite film.Not only is it fascinating and challenging, it's also an aesthetic wonder. The film is full of immaculate set pieces and glorious landscape shots that will take your breath away. It's an epic scale production for an epic scale story. Martin Scorsese captures the BC era Jerusalem with an ingenious eye for detail and a respect for the magnitude of his project. The film will blow you away in all its glory and vastness that can only be captured correctly by a genius like Scorsese. There are some hauntingly memorable shots all throughout this film that give new images to the name of Christ; images we have always associated with the man but never to the aesthetic prowess that Scorsese displays.Clocking in at close to three hours long, The Last Temptation of Christ is admittedly drawn out and accomplishes a lot in its time span, but I'm not sure to what end. The last 45 minutes is really what matters most about this film and what sets it apart from other films about Jesus. Everything before that is just build up, throwing in lots of food for thought which is, at times, a little tedious. Yet all in all this film is quite the spectacle. It's one of Scorsese's most ambitious and daring projects to date, and possibly one of his more memorable. Obviously I can't compare it to the likes of Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed, or Raging Bull, but The Last Temptation of Christ is certainly one of a kind.

After receiving the book in 1972, he did all he could to ensure it would be made. After a false start in 1983, he made two smaller, low-budget films to receive good-standing with studios in hopes that they would put up money for this controversial story. In 1987, he finally received it and was able to make the film he had wanted for almost 20 years. Not to be released without complaints and rejections, Scorsese's life was very much in danger over this film, leading him to believe that perhaps, maybe he had sinned against God by making this film.With this backstory in mind, to see The Last Temptation of Christ is to understand the sorrow and guilt Scorsese felt while making it. The character of Jesus, played wonderfully by Willem Dafoe, is the most human of any cinematic portrayal of Jesus ever done. At the beginning, he is self-conscious, frightened, unsure of this newfound relationship with God, who he claims attacks him like a wild bird. As the film progresses, he begins to understand why he is being called in particular by God. His view on his true mission changes throughout as he is conflicted over whether or not his message should be love or revolution. He is joined by Judas, seen here not as a betrayer but as a sympathetic spiritual brother doing his faithful duty to ensure God's will. There is also Mary Magdalene, the prostitute who becomes a follower of Jesus as well as his main source of temptation to leave God's plan and remain on Earth. Herein lies the controversy.When this film was released in 1988, many Christian conservative groups were outraged over the sheer blasphemy and inaccurate portrayals of biblical characters, which was so foreign to many audiences seeing as how previously these characters, particularly Jesus, had always been portrayed as stoic, devoted and completely encapsulated in their destiny. What Scorsese does here is give a different interpretation of who Jesus saw himself as, as well as his reaction to being called by God to save the world. The fact that this film is not based on the Gospels, but on a book by Nikos Kazantzakis, gave much clairvoyance to the notion of another Hollywood attempt to trash Christianity.Yet, what many Christian groups lashed out at occupies only a small part of the 164-minute film. The scenes with Mary Magdalene, as well as the final temptation sequence are indeed blasphemous by definition. Nevertheless, this is not reason enough to dismiss such a film completely out of hand. What many Christians failed to realize was that the film is actually about Christ's journey to discovering his purpose on Earth. He begins worrying about whether or not he is supposed to follow God, and ends by questioning the very notion of being both God and man. Without giving away what happens, let it be said that what does both challenges and assures the faith of the viewer, at least in my mind.Many Christians have stayed away from this film in the 20 years since it has been released, but I feel the best way to understand something that may or may not challenge your beliefs is to face it head-on and attempt to understand the director's intention and what the film has to say about the nature of this situation. Many will interpret Scorsese's vision differently, but all should keep in mind what the great St. Augustine said, paraphrased all truth is God's wherever it is found.

That's exactly why I actually never really understood the purpose of all these and I have to admit that I was going to become just one of the fanatics I was surrounded by.but I could still change this and start my own way of finding the truth about everything. it's probably not hard to understand either, that just starting it without anyone and without any help, is kind of difficult. What I did is that I looked for all the movies around that could explain me something that I needed, it could be about Christians or about any other kind of religion communities, their lives, traditions and cultures in general, for comparisons and better-developed conclusions.After reading some articles or watching different movies, I want to say that, this is one of the best that does not just describe the life of Jesus, but it's directly related to what the new testament is. such a human nature in Jesus is just so sensitive for anyone who watches it first and starts criticism after. I would say that it makes everything even more clear, than any fictional books or movies have ever made. yes, Christ was a human first. that's what should be emphasized. We are all human with the soul that any human had before Christ was sent to us, and everyone is still born with it. there are all these temptations around us and that's what makes a difference - there is another side, there is the god and it's revival in our mind is what is called divinity. Christ did have the same feelings and temptations and yes, he was tempted but in the final part of the movie he does not accidentally change his mind but he consciences his role, he understands the importance of it and his human nature dies while god's divinity becomes victorious.I still don't know how matchable my opinion is to more accepted and scientifically studied opinions but I consider this movie to be an example for not just Christians but for humanity in general about winning the battle against temptations.

It is clear from the Bible, that Jesus was human - he suffered temptation, he dealt with everything we did (including fear, doubt, lust, etc.). I believe it gives Jesus considerably more credibility knowing that he was human. That is one reason why I thought that this film really had something going for it.The first roadblock I hit was when it looked as if Jesus didn't just have doubts about his divinity - he honestly wasn't sure if he was God or just some crazy dude with weird dreams. This is where I think the film loses a lot of the serious Christian audience. It is almost common sense that Jesus must have known from the moment he met John the baptist (if not before) that he was God. It really irked me that God's interference at Jesus' baptism was completely skipped, there is no clearer event of Jesus' divinity than God, his spirit, and his son all being together and God even saying, this is my beloved son. Jesus' entire ministry throughout the film seems to be based off of a half-guessed hypothesis that perhaps Jesus is God. Even the miracles aren't able to shake this feeling of lost legitimacy for Jesus' divinity.Also Jesus' ministry itself seems to be flimsy, Jesus himself doesn't seem to know what he is teaching. There is almost nothing on forgiveness, very little about the gospel message of salvation, and of course the thoughtful, yet concise and clear words are gone. Most of Jesus' words seem ambiguous, radical and unconvincing; one wonders that if the film is true, how anyone could have listened to him and believed (thats how crazy he sounds).All the above didn't especially bother me as much though as the ending scenes. Although apparently it is all a sort of vision or dream of Jesus it is way too real and is way too long and detailed for a dream. Why would Jesus dwell so long on a if anyway? It doesn't make sense and makes Jesus seem even less divine and weak. But what kills me and, indeed, infuriated me was the scene with Paul. I was under the impression the whole thing was a sort of dream, but if thats true, why Paul? If Jesus didn't rise from the dead and instead was saved without the resurrection or redemption, THERE WOULD BE NO PAUL. Paul was not some simple man who just wanted to tell people what they wanted to believe! He was persecuted from the beginning of his ministry until his death! There is no way in any conceivable alternate reality that he would LIE about Christ!! This mere idea is outrageous and a real insult to any Christian. Paul was an incredibly well educated Jew, who, defended Judaism passionately until Jesus appeared to him (and he actually saw him, not just an ambiguous bright light) and he was able to see the TRUTH. What motivation would he have to spread a lie, to tell people what they wanted to hear?! To satisfy the feelings of humanity? Heck no, Paul was convinced that Christ had risen and that he was a witness to the risen Christ and that people should know the TRUTH. Why was Paul persecuted if he was just telling people what they wanted and what their feelings needed? If you ask me, the last half hour or so should be cut considerably, it doesn't add anything except confusion and oddity to both the plot and people's perceptions of Christianity.It is perhaps possible I have misinterpreted the last few scenes and that the message was in fact positive, but I still maintain that the very presence of such outrageous scenes (especially with Paul) is a disgrace to the movie and an insult to Christianity. After all Paul is the writer of half the new testament; even the suggestion of his entire gospel message being built on a lie is so distasteful it makes me want to vomit.But, like I said at the beginning, it still is a very interesting film at parts. The humanity of Jesus is often overlooked. But while examining his humanity it is paramount that his divinity is not marginalized because once that is done the entire Christian faith begins to look deceptive and unreal. It is important to stress that while Christ was human and was tempted, he was divine enough to resist all temptation and more importantly become the perfect lamb that takes away the sin of the world and overcome death in the resurrection.

My principal anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows, from my youth onward has been the incessant merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh and my soul is the arena where these two armies, have clashed and met. This film is not based upon the gospels, but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict. All Christians become familiar with Jesus the Son of Man, the Son of God. Nikos Kazantzakis created a portrait of the Theanthrope, the GodMan showing more of a hypothetical Jesus' Man side, or perhaps the ManGod. We see Jesus struggling with this identity, he finds the bearing of carrying God's will onto the world to much for him to handle and at times he resends it. At one point in the film he saysGod loves me I know he loves me, but I want him to stop, I want him to hate me. Later on he says You think it's blessing to know what God wants? It is possible that most men, would find that unbearable, impossible had they found themselves in such mission. The question perhaps to be raised here is, how can one do God's will, without ever giving in to the temptations of the flesh? Whilst we see a Christ free of sin, he is exposed to all human temptations such as fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust. This is also shown when Jesus is led, presumable by an angel, to a brothel and mumbles here I am where I least wish to be. Again though exposed to temptation, he remains free of sin and just walks away. The Jesus Christians know, was well aware of the fate that awaited him and faced it with humility and grace. The ManGod of this film feared the cross, did not want it to happen. Also the real Jesus, free from human passions (not compassion), did want to eradicate evil from the world but here he says I believed in love, but now I believe in the axe. I want to cut the devil's throat. Once more, we see a man aware of is mission here on earth but being a man has high levels of testosterone and uses language the Jesus of the gospels doesn't. Towards the end the last temptation does emerge. It is the devil, who visits Christ on the cross in the form of an angel, offering to release him from the suffering of crucifixion. Once this is done, Christ then leads an ordinary life and experiences human love, intimacy with women, fatherhood and a regular job. It is at this point, that the writer tried to tell us that had Christ chose this path it would eventually catch on with him. We then see a very powerful scene of an elderly Christ surrounded by his disciples and Judas in particular who criticizes him of cowardice saying, no sacrifice (for mankind), no salvation (of the mankind) and what is good for man, isn't good for God prompting Christ to repent asking his father to take him back (to the cross). There we see him on the cross and although in a lot of pain and anguish, he is relieved that his mission is accomplished. Just like the book, This film caused a great deal of controversy; the Roman Catholic church banished the screening, in Greece several screens were burned and when the book was published in 1951 the Greek Orthodox church renounced Nikos Kazantzakis and when he passed away 6 years later he was refused a funeral. In the UK, though the film was shown on live TV seven years after it was released, it still tops the list of most complained about TV programmes. It took several years before it was screened in many countries and still is banned in some. It is totally clear why accusations of blasphemy were voiced for this story and for any Christian, it would be shocking to watch this. However, somehow it seems to me this was not written in a disrespectful spirit but from an overwhelming affection towards Jesus. An affection and admiration so strong, that this great literary mind struggled to come to terms with His dual substance and decided to pen a more human side of Him, and Scorsese faithfully brought this vision to the big screen.

It's easy to understand why this is one of the most controversial films ever made, and I was afraid it could be gratuitous, exploitative and offensive, like Mel Gibson's exercise in bad taste and violence, The Passion of the Christ (2004), or Kevin Smith's hateful Dogma (1999), but thankfully I was wrong. The Last Temptation of Christ is one of Scorsese's best (and by far, the bravest) works; an extremely thought-provoking allegory of the life of Jesus as an ordinary man, facing mundane temptations, feeling the anguish, fear, desires and doubts that we all have through our lives.Based on Nikos Kazantzakis's novel of the same name, Scorsese's film was called blasphemous before it was released, and it's still considered as such nowadays for people who have never even seen it; religious fundamentalists (read fanatical hypocrites) picketed and threatened boycotts before its release; one group offered to buy the film from Universal to destroy it; some theaters refused to carry it, and it was banned in many countries, including South Africa, Chile and Philippines. The controversy that still surrounds this film prevents many people from seeing it, which is extremely sad. People who call this film blasphemous are the same who still consider homosexuality a sin because a passage in the Bible says so; people who take everything literally and don't dare to read between the lines; people whose faith is blind and often sick. Quoting the smart satire Saved! (2004), Why would God make us all so different if He wanted us to be the same? Blasphemy is NOT analyzing the world around us, not asking ourselves what our true beliefs are, not accepting others' viewpoints by agreeing with censorship. Open your mind, listen and take your own conclusions; I'd rather spend time watching a respectful, although not traditional, story of Jesus like The Last Temptation of Christ, rather than mindless, bloody self-atonement (The Passion of Gibson).

This picture brings us a revolutionary idea of Christ history, from the baptism to the cross/resurrection. The movie opens with a short text by Nikos Kazantzakis, about the dual substance of Christ, followed by the warning that the movie isn't based in the Gospell but upon the exploitation of the everlasting conflict.I think this pictures was so controversial when it was released because the human point of view of Jesus Christ that is presented. Its relationship with Magdalene and Mary, sister of Lazarus, were saw as scandalous to not opened minds.(Also the nudity scene when Jesus is crucified and the sexual relation with Mary Magdalene after her savement). After all, this a movie, not a real story about Christ last days as «Passion Of Christ» by Mel Gibson. We can't see this work neither as historic or a religious statement, but as a adaptation of Greek writer Nikos Kazantkakis novel. And this novel was written in 1945, the year in which World War II was over, millions of people have perished at the hands of Nazis, Fascists and Soviets Governements. The Roman Church has done nothing to save millions of life during this days. So we can read this novel as a strong criticism to ever desire of Man trying to reach GOD by fascist or communist rulers. When we see the Last Temptation of Christ, we have to think that this so-called TEMPTATION is the human desire of Man attempting to reach God.In the beginning Jesus is a man who makes crosses to the Romans, in which Jews are crucified. I think we can acknowledge that in the Chuch as an institution that has persecuted Hebrew people through the Medievaland Modern Times that is real murdering Jews. When Jesus talks with the monk of the monastery where he has spent one night, that he doesn't steal, doesn't kill, doesn't love women, not because he wants because is afraid of everything , I see that as the Fear put on people minds by Catholic Church during medieval. The fear of being arrested by open mind, the fear of the everlasting Hell, if their rules weren't accomplished.At last, this is a fictional picture about a real flesh and bone Man that existed 2000 years, that has lived among us, had doubts about his place on time and in HIstory, and that is believed as THE SON OF GOD by thousand of people around the world.Be a open mind to watch and love this movie.Luís Miguel Santos "},{"Title":"A unique religious film brilliant, but not for everyone","Date":"10 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I first saw The Last Temptation of Christ several years ago. Its scenes and images stayed with me, and its philosophical and religious themes often reemerged in my own reflections and questioning about the nature of things. It's that kind of a film. Recently, I watched it again, and found it to be just as powerful as I'd remembered.Based on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel (which I have not read), Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation of Christ is a provocative, haunting, fascinating film that really does rise to the level of a work of art. It may not be perfect (I thought it was longer than it needed to be, occasionally repetitive, and not every scene worked), but it is definitely a remarkable achievement, and one that I think should be regarded as a unique classic in the history of film.Most religious movies (and anti-religious movies too, for that matter) are content to just preach to their respective choirs &#150; reaffirming already accepted beliefs and attitudes in an entertaining way that pleases those who share them and fails to convince those who don't (e.g. The Greatest Story Ever Told, Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Passion of the Christ, Dogma, etc.). The Last Temptation of Christ is, by contrast, a movie about a religious subject that confronts all beliefs and attitudes with a profound and heartfelt questioning. It challenges each viewer's perspective on the significance of Christ regardless of what that perspective is. It overturns any facile acceptance or rejection by placing Christ's significance at the core of our human reality. The movie forces us to realize that how we regard the story of Christ is a personally important decision with consequences for how we view the world and ourselves, and that we must make that decision on the basis of insufficient information and competing interpretations. In other words, this is one religious film that actually brings us to the point where we must make a decision of faith &#150; and then leaves it completely up to us as to how we make that choice.The most effective method that this movie uses to shake up our preconceived ideas is one that hearkens back to Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling, a philosophical work about faith. In that book, Kierkegaard examined the significance of the story of Abraham's almost-sacrifice of his son Isaac by giving us alternate versions of it &#150; versions that were satisfying or impressive in other ways, but none of which had anywhere near the same power to convey the unique message about faith that exists in the original story. In its most memorable sequence, The Last Temptation of Christ shows us a version of Jesus' later years in which he attains a righteous, God-fearing, happy human life, but is not the Messiah sacrificed for the sins of the world &#150; and then makes us see just how much is lost to the world if that is all that Jesus achieved. If it is not unique, unsurpassable, and true, the story of Christ is virtually meaningless. And this movie makes us feel the emptiness of that possibility as a stark contrast to the triumphant accomplishment Jesus regains in the film's final scene.The two most controversial aspects of the movie are, first, that much of its story is outside the bounds of the familiar Gospel accounts of Jesus' life, and second, that it presents a very human depiction of Jesus, one that is frightened, uncertain, conflicted, and capable of making mistakes (although he never breaks a single one of the Ten Commandments in any of the scenes that are not described in the Gospels). To view these aspects of the movie as an attack on Christianity is, in my opinion, misguided. The Gospel accounts give a cryptic, fragmentary, and somewhat contradictory narrative of Jesus' life, and everyone who encounters this story forms their own understanding of what Jesus was like and what he did (and that understanding may go through a lot of changes during one's life). Everyone fleshes out the story in their own way, and it is legitimate for a novelist or a film-maker to do the same, especially if they are trying to illuminate human truths. Also, while the most orthodox Christian description of the nature of Jesus Christ is that he was wholly human and wholly divine, nearly every conventional Christian-themed Hollywood movie ever made has portrayed Jesus as being perfect, infallible, unassailably courageous, and completely aware of his destiny &#150; in other words, wholly divine but pretty much just going through the motions of being human. Without ignorance, uncertainty, fallibility, weakness and fear, how can one really be said to be wholly human (assuming that one does not agree with the Mel Gibson conception that excruciating physical pain is all that's required)? In the Christian theological tradition, denying Christ's humanity has been considered as much of a heresy as denying his divinity. Obviously, there's no such thing as a completely accurate portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth in any form of art, but at least The Last Temptation of Christ, in its Jonah-like portrayal of the Jewish carpenter overwhelmed by a relationship with God he cannot understand, gives us a characterization of the man that we could imagine having a personal conversation with, and even befriending and caring about, instead of being limited to the pious but dehumanizing sterility of uncomprehending awe.The Last Temptation of Christ is not a movie for those who want safely reverent retellings of the story as they know it (for those, I'd highly recommend the beautifully done Gospel of John). But for those believers and non-believers who are open to a profoundly artistic meditation on the essential meaning of Jesus' story in human reality, Scorcese's film is a masterpiece.

Then I have bought the soundtrack by Peter Gabriel, as I am a huge fan of his works. But I watched this movie by Martin Scorsese in 1992, years after it was released.I think this is one of those movies that can be fully understood if the audience had brief knowledge of the novel's author. Nikos is a devout Christian who had a hard time grasping and accepting that Jesus was both man and divine. So he wrote his novel The Last Temptation Of Christ as a way to explore and accept why Jesus was both man and divine.The novel itself is very deep and might require some readers to read it more than once. Also a good knowledge of Christianity will help tremendously. If anyone had read the book, then there's more hidden and powerful messages embedded deep within Scorsese's film, to be realized and/or captured by the viewer/audience. Obviously Scorsese couldn't possibly turn the movie 100% like the book, but he did incorporate a lot from the novel into this film ... by rich visuals and masterful editing ... rather than just acting with dialog.Practically, Nikos' story of The Last Temptation Of Christ is a big question Was Jesus man and divine at the same time? How so? Man is weak and prone to unholy temptations, while being divine is being strong, godly, and resistant to any evil temptation. Nikos struggled with this.In order for Nikos to reach a conclusion that Christ was in fact both man & divine, the author takes us to the day Jesus was crucified which is when he asked God, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?And right there, in the novel and this film, is when the dream-sequence begins. A little child who claims to be the guardian angel approaches Jesus and releases him from the crucifix. At this very moment, Jesus is no longer divine but 100% pure man, like any other man.As Jesus comes down from the cross, he is invisible to the eyes of the people around him ... he walks away ... but the rest of the people are still staring at the crucifix as if Jesus is still there.The story continues to follow Jesus as an ordinary man ... committing adultery ... marrying Mary Macdalen ... society around him goes into turmoil ... Jesus cannot save them. Until the very end, when the world is tumbling down all around him, only then Jesus cries out one more to his Father. And that's when Jesus wakes up to find himself back on the crucifix. And this is when the audience learns that it was all just a dream-sequence. Thus Nikos finds his answer, after he put himself in Jesus' shoes and followed any possible outcome stemming from the path of a divineless Christ living life as an ordinary man and susceptible to evil temptations.Indeed, at this point, Nikos may have convinced himself that Jesus was in fact more Divine appearing as man in flesh. If Christ was just a man, then of course he would be tempted by the devil (disguised as the guardian angel -- a little girl) to come down from the cross. But based on biblical facts, Jesus did NOT come down from the cross .. thus was NOT tempted easily by the devil .... and his death was holy.The story is deep. Read the book. You will appreciate the movie even more.THE SOUNDTRACK ..... Peter Gabriel should have been nominated for an Oscar. The soundtrack he composed and produced for this film is REVOLUTIONARY which had influenced countless of other movie/ soundtrack composers. Peter's record label 'Real World' has and continues to release top- notch world music from every coun try. He actually flew-in the musicians (from Turkey, Egypt, Africa, other parts of the Middle-East, and god knows from what other countries) to his Real World Studio in his countryside cottage. Top notch studio. Peter recorded the musicians as well as incorporating his own parts by using synthesizers, samplers, and other modern instruments. The engineering and mixing alone was most challenging in creating those beautiful sound textures. I believe Peter was one of the first to record with digital audio workstation computers known as WAVE, at that time, in addition to recording onto digital multitrack tape machines. In 1987, this was a big deal.I recommend that everyone should buy Peter Gabriel's soundtrack (called PASSION) .... and also to buy it's complimentary CD called PASSION SOURCES which has world tracks which influenced him to compose Passion. Passion is still the best soundtrack and work of musical art to date. And, have a listen to his soundtrack of the movie BIRDY. Bloody incredible. RICH RICH RICH. Emotional. MOVING.

In fact, if I were, I'd be strongly attempting to create severe stigmata.Whosoever trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.Oh boy, divine intervention can result in love, life, happiness, and crucification! Epilepsy and Tourrette Syndrome, as well, if you are one of those ministers that we all know and love so much. So the possibilities are really endless I guess, for Christians, and the film The Last Temptation Of Christ really, really proves it.Whoever did the casting for this movie, must have been on a serious acid trip. David Bowie plays Pontius Pilate, and that's one of the more LOGICAL acting roles assigned. I have to say, though, that Willem Dafoe couldn't have been a better choice for Jesus Christ, but that's an opinion that a lot of Boondock Saints fans will find hard to believe. Harvey Keitel is Judas? Excuse me, but I really, really didn't even see it coming, even after I had already read the credits.

I guess that it's no surprise that Hershey Kisses could be something of a metaphor, either, but where the hell was Barbara in, uhhh, the entire stretch from Boxcar Bertha to this movie? I guess Hoosiers must have really pushed the envelope forward... So with all of the obligatory E!-style ranting on actors aside, let's return to the things about this film that actually count. Paul Schrader and Martin Scorcese. Oh, good point, maybe the 100's of people that contributed to the Bible kind of matter in some way, too. Not in the way most conservatives would be interested in hearing about though. No, this film was based on NOVEL by an Italian named Nikos Kazantzakis.My main point that I'd make with any first-time viewer of this film would be; prepare to be overwhelmed. Not only does this stray from the original doctrine, but it seriously agitates our predefined image of Christ. The portrayal of him here, is less than glorious. He first appears as a torchered sinner who's employment depends on the persecution of his fellow Jews. We are often put, throughout the film, into a state of confusion over his relationship to women. To top it all off, we actually don't even get a sense if he even dies at the end.The most potent scene to me, was his escape to the desert, where he is tempted in many ways by sin. Of course temptation must have been flaunting around with him from the very beginning, where he admits to a Rabbi that he is a habitual liar and full of hatred in his heart. Where'd all that wine COME from anyway? Also, important to note are the scenes with John the Baptist, his exile from Nazareth, and his promise to baptize with fire. The cinematography, by Michael Ballhaus is unbelievable as usual by him. There are scenes of exquisite beauty, as well as stunning visual testimonies of pain and hardship. The eventual sex scene between Mary and Jesus was done very tastefully, and at times you can find yourself lost in the ancient world despite the low budget cost for the film.A couple of modern day miracles actually occurred during the making of the movie as well, and were allegedly totally unplanned by the producers. For example, the final scene where the camera shows Jesus on the cross, fades to white. Scorcese himself has adamantly told that this sequence happened by mere coincidence, and that the sun was just reflecting at a certain angle to create the effect. Also, interesting to mention, Willem Dafoe was temporarily blind for part of the shooting, for a three day period.Cynics of the film aside, this was easily one of the most spiritual movies ever made. Unquestionably thought provoking, and at it's peak a startling unstereotypical biography of one of humankind's most revered and idolized characters. A story, that with the duality of sin and love combined to almost complete perfection, has rarely been told with such outstanding results.So Lazarus, how do you feel?The Last Temptation Of Christ (1988) 10/10 "},{"Title":"Truly Satisfying","Date":"8 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I must say that this movie is one which you are bound to remember for the rest of your life.

While the beginning seems trivial and insignificant, later on it reveals to be not only another mundane Bible story version of the life of Jesus, but a most inspiring vision and contemplation about the duality of this figure. The movie shows Jesus not as the simple, passion-driven demigod portrayed in the Holy Book, but tries to sketch a different scenario, of Jesus as a man who, unwillingly, becomes the one destined to sacrifice himself in order to save the world. Dafoe plays a man who struggles, who doesn't understand God's divine plans for him. He acts as a normal man, he experiences fear and anger, joy and sadness, but is constantly haunted by visions, voices calling out for him as the Son of God and the prophesied Messiah. The interesting part of this movie is that it illustrates the crucial events of Jesus' life from a different, fascinating and intelligent point of view (Judas' betrayal, Jesus' being rejected by the Jews, etc.). It doesn't shield itself by the traditional it had to be so, because God wanted that, but even asks and answers questions itself in a non-blurred manner. From a technical angle, I liked every part of the movie ; the actors, the music, the script, the scenery. Even though the dialogs are not the so called Bible-sophisticated, they are performed very nicely and skillfully. In my opinion it's far better than the (also scandalous) Da Vinci Code in every way, basically because the case's center is not a primitive idea which is bound to wreck the catholic Church, but many philosophical layers surrounding the core of the idea itself.

This is the most humane Jesus ever. The temptation is the normal life that any one of us has (or tries to at least) a home, a family, a wife, children, love, anger.Kazantzakis was almost excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox Church for this book (as for a series of others too, such as Christ Recricified) because of this very idea. However, I tend to consider Kazantazakis as a person with great faith, due to which he was trying to find the truth.Kazantzakis argues that Jesus, as a human being, would have wanted all that. That is the very temptation. And He lives that in a dream-like situation while on the cross. But at the end, Jesus denies all earthly delights (in his vision) in order to be crucified and resurrected.Kazantzakis depicts the most human Jesus, hence the most accessible, for many.

A successful athlete fights effectively the temptation to take it easy and relax, a good student fights the temptation to sleep early in exam days, a honest police officer fights the temptation of accepting a bribe&#133;.and so on. Success in life and defeating temptation are two sides of the same coin.Now Scorsese's movie (this one the closest to his heart) is conveying just that. The Jesus in this story is completely unsure of himself, in fact he is weak, he needs Judas to protect him, hold him. He, just like all of us wants to lead a normal life, get married and have kids, and why shouldn't he?? But no, he must not, he cannot, because that would come in the way of god's plan. So does he just tell his heart, 'Look, don't tempt me to live that life, I am born for a different purpose', and the heart would say 'All right, I'm sorry I didn't realize that, 'click' there, I turned off the temptation switch, it wont bother u any more' We all know its not that simple, temptations are a part of human life, thats what makes us who we are. So the movie portrays beautifully, the constant inner voice of Jesus asking god 'Why me??, don't I deserve a normal life??'. Finally he fights all the temptations and is crucified, but when he feels the monstrous pain of the nails biting through his bones through the wood, the mortal human side of him resurrects, and is again over come with the desire to say 'hell with it, I don't care ,I'm outta here'.***Spoiler**** And thats when the often misunderstood and controversial portion of the movie begins. The lord of temptations 'satan' deceives him into accepting the life he wanted, he gets married to Mary Magdalene, has children, grows old and is about to die an old man, when he is confronted with the truth that all this was a sham.He asks for forgiveness from the almighty and is granted just that.....and 'bam' he is back on the cross........elated to find all that just happened was just his whole alternate strayed life compressed into an ephemeral moment, the whole package designed by god to convince him that this is the righteous path....the solution to his life's conundrum, the end of all miseries.The problem is that we aren't as fortunate, we don't have the luxury of living the whole life and then begging god to put us back to the place where we succumbed to temptation. So the beautiful moral of this story is that to succeed in life, you gotta overcome the temptations of daily life that hinder your progress.I find this the most powerful portrayal of Jesus Christ in any movie. Most of the previous movies, show him as born a god, so he doesn't have to fight any temptations, he just has to get crucified. I say 'What's the big deal in that??, If I was god I could do that too.' But no I'm not one, fighting the temptations in spite being a human might bring me closer to one though. Will make me realize my dreams. Make me successful. Reach my final goal. Just how the real Jesus must have done it. And that's why this movie is so special. It approaches the subject of Jesus's personality from a different and more plausible perspective.

I'll concede that Jesus is portrayed as less than ideal--tortured, harsh, overly salesmanlike, maybe even, as someone commented in the forum, a bad person. Certainly the theology isn't orthodox, and I think that most everyone involved in its production would agree. But while the Jesus presented here isn't perfect, he's also, I would argue, far more sympathetic than the wooden Christ of Zeffirelli's film or the bloody pincushion of Mel Gibson's travesty. What Scorcese presents is not a devotional film but an inspirational one in the truest sense of the word shown Christ's (possible) struggles and triumphs, we are called to follow. In this regard the film's most powerful line is not the traditional It is accomplished, but the writers' own I want to be the Messiah. It is my firm belief that this film will, despite some uncomfortable passages, gradually be recognized as a masterpiece both of film-making and of devotion. What Jesus willingly gives up is far more powerful than the bloodshed of The Passion, and what this means is far clearer and more inspiring.(Notably, a number of Christian groups (most prominently the Promise Keepers) have reached a similar understanding of the film. ) "},{"Title":"Not your average Jesus film","Date":"2 January 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This film begins with a disclaimer that it is fictional and not based on the gospels. This is just as well, as it slightly prepares the viewer for one of the most bizarre movies about Christ ever made. In contrast to the strong, silent character that Jesus is usually portrayed as (eg Ben Hur, King of Kings, Passion of the Christ), this incarnation is weak, emotional, and for much of the time seems completely off his head. Some familiar names such as Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist have roles, but they are all also entirely different characters to the ones that people would be used to. Judas, for example, is a much stronger character than Jesus himself, and only betrays Jesus because he begs him to do so. It takes a while for the viewer to get their head around the role reversals and warped storyline, but everything (sort of) happens as it should, right up until the scene where Jesus is hanging on the cross. To state it simply, at this point things start to get very weird.The Last Temptation of Christ is incredibly unique, but is not for everybody. The film sometimes deviates quite sharply from the traditional view of the life and personality of Jesus, and there is a fair amount of sex and nudity, so people who have serious religious beliefs will probably feel uncomfortable watching. All the same, I would recommend this movie as a must see for any avid film watchers, quite simply for the reason that there has never been a film like it, and never will be another.

Except for one moment during the Sermon on the Mount, when he sounds like a salesman, Willem Dafoe gives one of the greatest performances of all time as Jesus. He is at times pitiful, inspiring, awesome and terrifiyingly intense, as his version of Jesus struggles to find the right way to achieve God's will. Dafoe is very well supported by Harvey Keitel as an unconventional Judas and Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, and though there are a few lines that I think could have been better written, perhaps using more of the power of the Bible's language, and it slows down a little too much towards the end, it is a classic beautifully shot with a superb Peter Gabriel soundtrack and an ending that is truly profound. It is at the end that you realise why the film is called 'The Last Temptation'.For Christians, I think this should almost be compulsory viewing. It does not try to erode the authority of Jesus (both Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader were Christians), but rather builds it up by making him seem more real, and thus more believable. I am and probably will remain an atheist, but I still found this one of the most moving films I've seen.

I didn't see it until I was 25.  My parents, being devout Catholics, thought it was evil though they never saw it.  One of priest in my parish came and talked to my 7th Grade class when the film was out.  He had not seen the film but had read the book and seemed to have liked it.I am still a devout Catholic and I think that this is a good film. There are a few flaws in it artistically.  Especially in the John the Baptist sequence, it seemed like it was something out of Woodstock (which incidentally Scorsese worked on the documentary of that famous concert) than 1st Century Israel. There is some confusion with Jesus's relationship to Mary Magdalen if you haven't read the book.The one thing that I really liked about this film is that it explores mystery of the Incarnation.  The Incarnation is God became man in the person of Jesus Christ. What was it like to be both God and man? It is something that we will never truly understand.  Was it tough on Jesus?  I would imagine so.  (I am assuming, of course, that the Incarnation was and is a reality.)  Did he know from when he was a small child or was it more gradual?  I would assume the latter.  So does the film.  This film is a moving and powerful film.  I did not find it blasphemous.  One reason I didn't is because it is a fictitious portrayal of Jesus's life.  This is not exactly how it happened. Neither are the gospels for that matter but they are probably closer than the Jesus Seminar People would like to think.As for people saying the film was made by atheists it was not. Scorsese was raised a Catholic and still believes in Jesus.  The film is not athiestic at all because Jesus is God and man in the film.  People say that Jesus sins in the film, that is debatable. (Spoiler)  Jesus is not sinning when he comes down off the cross and marries Mary Magdalen, it is a temptation.  He rejects it and excepts his death on the cross, which is the most beautiful part of the film.  Building crosses for the Romans I had some problems with but I had to remember it is fiction.  (Plus, he was a carpenter and someone had to do it not that the real historical Jesus of Nazareth ever actually did that.)Fundamentalists don't like this film but I have a lot of problems with fundamentalists whether they be Catholic or Protestant.  I think that they are causing a deep wound in Christianity.  I think that they forget about the love that Jesus has for all humanity and think that it is just them he loves.  I think they are cancer to Christianity.  And their mentality isn't too far from the mentality of Islamic fundamentalists (note my emphasis is on fundamentalists and not Islamic).     See this film.

The film really challenges the viewer to think outside his or her assessments of what Christ was like.  It displays Christ (Willem Defoe, in the best performance of his career)as a flawed character who has impulses and is easily tempted like any other human being.  He truly doesn't want to be the messiah at all, he builds cross after cross for the Romans so that they may execute anyone and everyone who claims to be a messiah, desperately wanting God to hate him.  When Christ cures the blind man, he is not pleased that he succeeded at all because he realizes that he is a step closer to the cross himself.  As he's being crucified, his guardian angel comes to him and tells him he is not the messiah.  Unwilling from the start, he allows the angel to take him to a promising new life with a wife and children, his final surrender to temptation.  Defoe's layered, challenging performance succeeds in brining the complex character of Christ to life.  His eyes perfectly display his pain; his voice really shows Christ's frustration.  It's an absolutely splendid performance, for which he was unjustly denied a Best Actor Oscar or even a nomination.  It's easy to see why the church did not approve of such a premise, but the close minded manner in which they responded to the film was really unbelievable.  They wanted to pay Universal studios for the negative and burn it before there was even a chance to see it.  Most of the protesters hadn't seen the film at all.  Some churches even went as far as to make up scenes that were in the movie to discourage people form seeing it.  Although it seems to me that these kind of extreme Christians tend to forget their own beliefs.  Christ was all God AND all Man, so inevitably, his more human preferences win out over his unavoidable destiny, which I suppose didn't fit every church's criteria of how the story of Christ should be told.  Some people I know who have stereotyped those involved in the film as being satanists or atheists, absurd considering Martin Scorses in Roman Catholic.  I myself am an Atheist, I lost my faith the Church about two years ago, and I can safely say that this film did a lot more for Christ and my view on him the all the years of preachy brain washing ever did.  This film makes Christ a character who is much easier to relate to (something that can't be said for such films as the wretched TV movie Jesus).

The theology wasn't all correct, but that wasn't the point at all! (Give me free thinking before dogmatism any day.) Defoe was brilliant at depicting the man who painfully learned over time that he was the Messiah. Let's face it - being the Messiah had to be pretty lonely. I have only a few criticisms Kietel's New York accent was a distraction, the scene with Paul preaching and then confronting Jesus seemed superfluous...maybe it made more sense in the book, and John the Baptist and his followers were probably not so odd.  Several scenes really brought the Gospels to life for me. Jesus at the wedding party was having a grand ol' time dancing and socializing; raising Lazarus from the dead surprised Jesus perhaps more than anyone else; and then there was the tense moment when Jesus was beginning to lead a revolt against Rome in the Temple, but he could not follow through because God did not tell him to proceed. The movie reminded me that Jesus didn't always know what was going to happen - he didn't have the Gospels to read and find out how everything ends. He lived day by day like we do, and, as he said in the movie, God told him a little at a time - as much as he needed to know. Brilliant film, Defoe was never better.

Nevertheless I was very curious about it. The movie summarizes the life of Jesus of Nazareth from the time of adulthood until his Crucifixion. What had gone before or after that period were totally ignored, in order to create a more secular depiction of Jesus the man. Interestingly the movie takes the viewers into the mind of Jesus, instead of 'seeing' Him from a third party point of view, as he agonizes over the call from God. DeFoe's performance was good enough to project the suffering side of Jesus and I can really feel his pain/doubts in accepting the Path chosen by God. However, Harvey Kietel was simply miscasted as Judas Iscariot. There are also moments of high spiritualism, i.e the time when Prophet Isiah appeared before Jesus and brought the message from God in the form of a blank scroll. The scroll is only readable when Jesus 'scans' them with his palm. That was cool. In terms of context, there are two points in the movie that I feel many spectators and critics alike had missed. One the character of Jesus in this movie, is the alter-ego of the director, Martin Scorsese (who was born a christian), who clearly stated that he made this movie as a parallel accounts to his own inner turmoil between good and evil throughout his life. Second, the 'last temptation' in the movie, does not cancel the True message of the Cross. On the contrary, this very last temptation had elevated my faith in Christ to a higher extent.

Indeed, it is well know that, in Gethsemane, he begged to be released from the need for crucifixion; moreover, he cried out in anguish about being abandoned while suffering on the cross &#150; both indicative of all too-human reactions.So, that aspect should not upset any people who believe in the sanctity of Christ. If it does, that says more about the quality of their own belief than in the truth of the portrayal.What should upset them more is the manner in which the narrative turns the betrayal of Christ on its head - a truly imaginative and thought provoking perspective that had not occurred to me, growing up, as I did, steeped in the Christian faith. That part of my life is long gone, but the fascination with Christ &#150; arguably the first political dissident who changed the world &#150; remains (Karl Marx probably comes in second).I first saw this film ten years ago, and saw it again just recently. Time has not dimmed the effectiveness of Scorsese's direction and the acting by the stellar cast. While Willem Dafoe takes the role of Jesus in his stride, I think most kudos go to Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot, shown as a political opportunist who wants to see the Romans crushed and the Kingdom of God established on earth; Judas is, alas, the ultimate man who missed the ultimate point. Special mention goes to Harry Dean Stanton as Saul the tax collector (later St. Paul) while Barbara Hershey is very effective as Mary Magdalene. David Bowie's (almost) cameo appearance as Pontius Pilate was adroitly casual, if not entirely indifferent about the man on trial.The value in this narrative is that there may be more real truth in it than in some of the Gospels that were, after all, written many years after the actual crucifixion. Time, as we know, has a habit of playing tricks on our memories.This is not the movie for hard-core believers in the New Testament. It's a finely stated exposition of a point of view about the nature of our humanity and one that demands consideration, whether or not you believe in God and an afterlife very much a departure for Scorsese but one that is well worth the time to see.

Willem Dafoe is excellent and is up there as the best of the actors that have portrayed Jesus over the last fifty years of film.   David Bowie was sadly miss cast as was Keitel but Barbara Hershey is nothing more than outstanding as Mary Magdalene in the darkest portrayal of her yet.  This is what The Passion lacked in the story of the relationship between Jesus and Mary but Passion is not about Jesus' life, it's about his death and that's where these two films are different.  Scorsese's version is more about love and temptation and the things that make us feel good and bad about ourselves whether we are doing the right thing or not.   Jesus has sexual feelings for Mary in this and he probably did really.  I mean I am not one to start a debate on whether he did or not but Jesus was still a human being but a human being with a special gift but why should that make him any different to other people.  His message was love and love was what he felt so why not love Mary.  I am not saying that he definitely did but what is so wrong if he did.  Why should we waist our time and make over one thousand complaints to Channel 4 in the UK all because a film based on a novel by                     Nikos Kazantzakis suggested that Jesus had desirable feelings for a woman.   I am sure somebody can argue with me on that and tell me something I don't know but it's important to remember who were are and to remember that because people have gifts doesn't make them different as a human being.   Because Albert Einstein had some amazing inventions does it make him a better person than me because he has a knack for coming up with new and inventive inventions.  Not really but Jesus is the son of God supposedly so who am I to argue but we have been made to believe that by what we read.  That's why this film is so important because it offers us a new insight to a Jesus that was slightly different to the one we know and love in the story of the Bible.I'm going to regret even reviewing this but it's something to think about which is always important.

Reading Kazantzakis is like taking a ladle and stiring your mind. It's like having a constant fever of questions and looking to the answers as water to cool you down. The movie tries very hard, but it certainly can't transmit us this fever. If you don't plan to read the book, then the movie is a must-see. But the book is much-much better and vastly more thought-provoking. Kazantzakis was a burning Christian for a long time in his life. He has also been a communist/atheist and a Buddhist, but on his grave the following words are written I believe in nothing, I hope for nothing, I'm free. Another movie based on a book of his is Zorba the Greek (with Anthony Quinn), and it captures the spirit of the book much better, but we have to admit that the subject of The Last Temptation is much more difficult.

Thanks to the likes of countless one-dimensional portrayals (the Jesus film, Greatest Story..., etc), that very profound, very true, very important statement has come to mean nothing.Forgetting what it means for Jesus to be a man completely invalidates what it means for Jesus to be God.  Jesus' being all man and being all God are inseperable.  But most films gloss over the 'all-man' aspect without exploring what it really means to be tempted, to be fearful, to be weak, to be lustful, and to always wrestle with what it means to be the Messiah. The Last Temptation of Christ explores what it means for Jesus to be man by focusing on some very human questions that all men of greatness must confront.Scorcese's movie, based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, takes the Jesus of platitudes, cliches, and proverbs too often quoted without thought or context, and turns him into a Jesus of rich personal dilemma, of great love, of great care, and of true capacity to be a saviour.Kazantzakis/Scorcese make Jesus a real person again, they save Jesus from tired and meaningless understandings of his character.  This brilliant team, fully realized by the acting of the cast, put human motivations and therefore purpose into the story of Christ's struggle.

And it is now clear to me that THEY don't understand the true meaning of Christs' sacrifice.That's the point of this film.  It's not about the literal re-telling of the Biblical version of the crucifixion (which has been translated and re-translated so many times over 2000 years that no honestly rational person can accept it as totally accurate).  It is an attempt to get us to realise that what Jesus did for us was not easy.  It was hard.  Not just in terms of physical pain, but also in terms of mental and emotional anguish.  Folks, that's why it was a SACRIFICE!  If Jesus was not human, but totally God, then how could a few hours on a cross truly affect Him?  Where's the meaning of it all then?Seeing Willem Dafoe's characterization of Christ on the Cross brought tears to my eyes in a way that no fundamentalist church's passion play could ever hope to do.  I wish to thank Dafoe, Scorsese, Schrader, Peter Gabriel and all the rest for their gift to all of us.  And to those who consider this film (and me) blasphemous, so be it.

Those who protested at its opening in 1988, and continue to decry its supposed blasphemy of the life of Jesus, have obviously never seen the film and are acting upon only what they've heard.  Those who claim that the film was made by athiests (or whatever they say) obviously know nothing about the film or the novel that it was based upon.  The novel, upon which the film is based, was written by a devout Greek Orthodox (Nikos Kazantzakis); the screenplay was written by a devout Calvinist (Paul Schrader); and the film was directed by a devout Roman Catholic (Martin Scorsese).  To those who judge without facts, my advise is to see the film and judge for yourself. I first saw the film back when it first hit video in 1990 and I recently bought Criterion's superb DVD.  While I was touched the first time I saw the film over 10 years ago, I hadn't had a chance to see the film again until the other night.  The film this time moved me in ways that few films I have ever seen (and trust me, I've seen a lot of movies in my 35 years on this earth).  The film makes Jesus so much more approachable, by concentrating on His human side.  We are all taught that Jesus was fully God but also fully man.  However, no other film had ever presented Jesus' human side and as a consequence He always seemed so superhuman and so divine that it made Him seem somewhat unapproachable.  Last Temptation makes Jesus more approachable than He has ever been, and its my bet that no other work like this will ever surpass it. The performances are all first rate from Willem DaFoe's portrayal of Jesus to Harvey Keitel's Judas to Barbara Hershey's Mary Magdelene.  This is easily Scorsese's most personal film and could very well be the film that will in generations to come will be considered his masterpiece.  The film is also a wonderful example of how a religious film can work without being a huge, spectacular epic such as films like The Ten Commandments, King Of Kings, and The Greatest Story Ever Told. Out of five stars, I would merit this film five stars without any trepidation.

There seems to be a penchant for comparing this interpretation of Christ's crucifixion to that of the Bible for the sake of religious comment.  I see how this is possible, yet let's broaden our prospective.This film uses a biblical character to discuss not Jesus necessarily, but the potential of MAN.  If we detach ourselves from what we know about the Bible and Christianity and apply the message to ourselves instead I think we may see and feel what was the intent of the filmmaker.  What I received from this film was a reaffirmation that Jesus' life is a life that we are all leading, full of choices of whether we live as man, as we have come to know him, or choose the high road, the difficult, frightening, painful and ultimately (hopefully) joyous one of living above the confines of our humanness for the SAKE OF EACH OTHER.I know it's rather daring to say that I think we are all the Messiah, all here to spread God's love and all here for each other before ourselves. That is what I believe and I believe the message of this film.  I don't feel it's about religion per se, and those who feel the film is blasphemous may just be unwilling to believe that the power to change the world doesn't lie in a God that already has a plan for us, but rather in ourselves to live life in the highest realm, as God has given us the power to.  Scary, yes, because then we, not God, are to blame if something goes wrong.  But God created this earth for us, not for Himself and I think is much more interested in intention, not outcome.Just my thoughts, you don't have to buy it if you don't want to. Thanks.

As well as the film being very spiritual, it is also highly enjoyable with the portrayal of the two sides of Jesus, the divine and the human.  The disgust He feels for Himself, the anger at God, and the temptations of Satan are written and shot beautifully, and as the film moves along to the inevitable crucifixion and 'the last temptation', I was totally drawn into the film and by the end felt very angry with those people who tried to stop the film being made, and those who judged it without seeing it.  I cannot see how the film can be offensive, when it states at the beginning how it is not based upon the Gospels.  This is a film that made me really think about Jesus in such a deep way, more than anyone or thing has before.

And then the movie will drag on like a bad, scratched, old record from some garage sale old-records-for-5-cents box. Turn it off, go back to the other Passion movie.But guess what, Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ is not child's play. It's not easy stuff to chew, swallow and digest. For one, it was written in Greek. Then there's the movie's main theme and star character. Jesus of Nazareth. Who's NOT (by the way) the guy you've heard about. Kazantzakis's Jesus is a troubled man. By today's standards he's schizophrenic. He's also indecisive but a charismatic and inspirational man who has a problem authority the Jews, the Romans, and yes, God. Then there's another interesting phenomena that is perhaps equally troubling to some minds, and that is Judas's portrayal. He's also not the guy you're used to hearing about, but instead a rather intriguing interpretation which bears much resemblance to early gnostic portrayals. The characters in this film are complex to say the least. They challenge very forcefully our ideas about Christianity, religion and faith as a whole. It is in fact an exercise of philosophy that actually leads to the appreciation of this piece of cinematic history. I first saw this film as a child. My parents made me watch it. For years, I went to sleep every night listening to Peter Gabriel's fantastic score. I was captivated by the ancient sounds, the mystical tones, and the vibrant rhythms. I couldn't care less for the film. It was boring!As an adult I've watch this movie at least a dozen times. Every time thinking and researching for weeks afterwards. Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel are an outstanding pair on screen. Even in their off beat accents and looks, the actors offer world class performances. Dafoe's intimate personality on screen is ever too relevant in this story. Keitel's interpretations of one of history's most hated individuals, Judas, is straight out of his own gospel.Scorsese made this as any art director would. He set his film in a truly spectacular setting, Hired a famous musician to direct the score, and then shot the cast in a very candid way, exposing the very complexity of Kazantzakis's work. There aren't any long winded scenes of lacerations or colossal battles between good and evil. There isn't really much action. As a result, the film is boring and dull to most movie audiences.To those who appreciate art, philosophy and reason. This film is for you.Everyone else, keep watching the other Passion.

You can safely skip the first 120 minutes of the movie if you know the gospel story - you will not lose anything; Scorsese doesn't bring anything new here.

It was not until I began a fascination with Martin Scorsese's movies that I stayed up late to watch this one night on television, to see if the controversy surrounding it was appropriate or not.If you've read The Da Vinci Code you're already familiar with the concept that Jesus Christ (played here by Willem Dafoe) was more flesh and bones than we given Him credit for, and was tempted to betray God and live with His true love, Mary Magdalene, rather than die for our sins. This is referenced by Dan Brown in the overlong and silly 20-page explanation of the true Holy Grail -- who Brown proposes is not an object, but a living person Mary Magdalene, whom Jesus impregnated.The Catholic Church took an immediate disliking to this concept. As Scorsese's film not-so-subtly implies that this is the case, it was panned and, in some cases, banned; the Church called it sacrilegious and many people refused to even see it, just based on its subject matter.Robert De Niro turned down the lead role of Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ, and probably because he was aware of the controversy it would stir. It was one of the only roles Scorsese offered him that he has turned down, the other being The Butcher in Gangs of New York. Although The Last Temptation of Christ is made with some insight and Scorsese suffered trials and tribulations to bring it to the screen, I'd say it's one of the lesser efforts of Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's combined efforts.The film is interesting but the acting is a bit off. I remember one sequence where Harvey Keitel (playing Judas) beats Jesus and Jesus lowers to Judas' feet and begs forgiveness. It all seems a bit hokey and staged, and Harvey Keitel is out-of-place, wearing what looks to be a very odd replica of the era's clothing.The movie is based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, whose work was complete fiction, as the author himself has claimed. As a result Scorsese's work is not claiming to be an accurate depiction of Christ's death, but rather a new twist to the tale based on another book.Do I think this is wrong? To be honest, yes, I do. On one hand I consider a fresh perspective refreshing, but on the other hand it seems wrong to base anything off of religious iconography and attempt to twist it into something human.Scorsese had to knew what he'd endure to release this. I don't think it was a surprise.But enough about the controversy. Purely as a film, The Last Temptation of Christ is beautiful to look at but I do feel some of it is rather hokey. As I mentioned above, some of the acting seems misplaced. Mel's version is definitely the more realistic of the two.But if you do have a (very) open mind and are not religious you might enjoy this. If you are religious and have a closed mind about your faith, stay away from this and The Da Vinci Code as they'll both probably just upset you and cause stress.In my opinion The Last Temptation of Christ is a good movie, but I do understand why people were outraged (and I rarely do with films) because Scorsese is touching on a very fragile subject matter here and it would have been quite naive of him to expect people to love his film. I like to think that he was smart enough to foresee the hatred for this movie. I'm pretty sure he knew.

(I mean, really, what could be their problem? That little bit of Jesus' sex scene with Mary Magdalene, a mere glimpse of two clothed bodies kissing passionately? ) Religious rantings aside, this much-hyped and controversial movie seems to be both an artistic and moral(istic) triumph.Scorsese proved why he is one of the important directors and artists of his time. Combining elegance, cleverness and sensitivity in his direction, he was able to evoke the humanity of Jesus Christ without much melodramatic self-righteousness. A less adept director could have easily made Jesus look like a pathetic wimp- the aim, as the introduction declared, was to depict a very-human Jesus Christ. I was bored and antsy during the first hour or so, notwithstanding Scorsese's beautiful cinematography and expert camera work.Basically, the movie chronicles the crucial times in Jesus' life, from the time the angel came to him to reveal his messiastic mission up to the time he was executed and resurrected. Every Christian is supposed to know that already. (from the point of view of someone in a predominantly Judeo-Christian country) The big bonuses come in the priceless little insights we get- how Jesus was so afraid and weak about this task, how doubtful he was, how fear gnawed at his holy heart. Who would have thought the Messiah had a huge inferiority complex? My favorite scenes were the part where a religious leader (who, I was told, is the musical genius David Bowie!) explains to Jesus why the people needed the illusion of Jesus' resurrection to give them hope; and that orgiastic scene in Jordan River with a creepy and funny St. John the Baptist delivering some spooky over-the-top loud brash `repent! Repent!' lecture. I always knew St. John the Baptist was a punk!The fascinating part of the movie comes in the last 40 minutes or so, showing an alternate reality for Jesus Christ. What if Jesus actually reneged on his promise to follow God's plan and actually chose to live like an ordinary human being?On the opening scene, Jesus cunningly thought that the angel visiting him- giving him fainting spells and spiritual revelations- was the devil. On the last part of the story, another angel reveals something twisted and surprising. It seems to me that angels mess around with Jesus Christ too much.Willem Dafoe as Jesus Christ was a fine actor though I thought he was a bit too `serious'. Well, if he's supposed to be very human, shouldn't he be laughing and goofing around, too? The one playing Judas annoyed me.Peter Gabriel provided an Eastern-inspired musical score, like the sounds in India. The wailing voices simulate Jesus' lament, and the repetitive drums, the sustained tension as well as the urgent forces to botch up Jesus' mission.If I didn't know that the budget for this flick was severely cut, I'd lament their leaving out key events in Jesus' life, like the Pontius Pilate scene where the Jews' agree that he get killed.All in all, the movie succeeded in showing Jesus to be a human being who CHOSE to let himself be sacrificed for our sins, and the spiritually inclined may well ponder on this and its implications to their faith and doctrine. For the non-Christians like me, Jesus may still be admired and idolized- he is, after all, a cool guy who, like everyone else, got tempted, hurt, disillusioned, and bummed out. (cool because he hangs out with the dregs of society- lepers, prostitutes, etc.)I don't think the movie showed Jesus Christ as a very-human or `fully- human' if you will, light at all- but that couldn't be the movie's fault, since they were just working on the book's premise.I am tempted to say that this movie is not one of Scorsese's best works, but then why would I contradict my earlier statement?But then it just might be that the devil made me say that.

Nudity? So what? Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. The Romans DID crucify people naked. Sex? Sex is not inherently evil. It is a part of our being and soul. It's hard for us to wrap our heads around it, but Jesus was human, so he did have a sexual identity as well as a drive. He just never had a family to fulfill it. Jesus could have refused God's plan or come off the cross and live a full life.In short &#x96; the ideas were good but never executed well at all. The first two-third of the movie move at a snail's pace, and bring in ideas from left field talking serpents, a sex-a-thon by Mary Magdalene, tattoos, and Jesus the carpenter making crosses for crucifixions. By the third act, when Jesus lives through a life in which he marries Mary and has two children, then realizes his disobedience hurt humanity, the audience will likely think I shouldn't have waited for the movie!Wilhelm Defoe does his best at portraying Christ. Of course, this is entertainment, not Christian Doctrine. In doctrine, we admit Christ was both fully human and fully God. While previous actors err on the deity side, Defoe errs on the humanity side. Yes, it might be easier for audiences to identify with a more human portrayal, but Defoe lets it take over and he ends up over-acting. Jim Caviezel's portrayal in the Passion of the Christ was far superior, somehow pulling off the balancing act. The direction is Scorsese's nadir, showing an uneven focus. Maybe he was trying to do too many things with the film and could not find a cohesive story.The one thing to its credit is that it did not go overboard on the torture of Christ as The Passion of the Christ did. It's made real without going overboard. The movie also does not portray Pilate as a person who felt trapped by the Jews and an unwilling executioner as the former movie did as well.Other than that, this movie, despite its best intentions falls short of its lofty goals.

They sometimes act as if they are larger than life. Like actor Denzel Washington in the movie, The Book of Eli, they call themselves the guardians of the orthodoxy of the truth of God, but in protecting the Book and the Name of God, they inadvertently neglect and even destroy the people whom God have made, one way or the other, for the God whom they call Love. They are not always wise and nice.Neither do Christians always do the right things. They sometimes put their nose where they don't belong. Perhaps you too can relate to one particular incident that happened in the summer of 1988 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I certainly can. I was there. Perhaps you were there too, in that hot afternoon, on your way to the cinema for the movie, The Last Temptation of Christ. You would then have met a large group of Christians, standing outside of the cinema complex, lobbying against the producer and the promoters of that movie. Some of these lobbyists, to your consternation, had even lobbied against you &#x96; in your face. They might have even blocked your entrance to the parking. I know. I was there. The truth is I was one of them. I was a new Christian then. And now you know what I did that summer.I have much regret since that episode. My greatest regret is that I didn't even watch that movie myself. I had instead relegated the decision for non-participation, and worse yet, for thinking that it was alright to infringe your God-given liberty, to the authority figures in our institution, who most likely had not watched the movie either. We were probably furious with the title of the movie itself, and had thought it a blasphemy against our creator and saving God. Or some of us might have felt mocked as God's people in a nation under God. Today, I have grown older, and hopefully wiser. Not only do I now think that Jesus was not mocked that day, but He was sought by those who were curious about Him and His fame, for people around the world have never stopped talking about Him, since His visitation to earth. They even talk about Him in movies, though their stories are not always in line with that of the church. In fact I can imagine Jesus was present at the protest. I can imagine Him looking on, as the protest went on. Instead, He was passionately looking out for those who were yet to know Him, for those yet to experience His love and His transforming power.Today, I have also grown, more in love with Him, Jesus Christ Superstar. Perhaps this is why I am still unable to make myself to watch The Last Temptation. I can almost feel the pain in some of our hearts at the protest, seeing our Lord, our best Friend, being once again misunderstood and ridiculed, only this time we were there, helplessly looking on.In the final analysis, it is all about love. God loved the world so much that He gave Jesus His only Son, to all of us who are not always wise, not always nice, so that we may be loved, may be changed, to be more like His Son. In response, we may be able to respond to His love in kind; to Him and to this world that He loves so much.

Directed by Martin Scorcese, this film is still one of the most widely talked about films today. I for one, happened to like this movie despite some unexpected scenes and being a Christian. It's well-written, well-acted, but it takes a long time to get where it wants to go. It's also may more talkative than I may have wished for.Marty's film is not directly based off the gospels themselves, but more about the inner struggles Jesus had between himself and Satan. This film does a good job of making Jesus not perfect like we all think of him as. For example, this film has him going against his father which we don't think of him as.This film is well-acted. Willem Dafoe may have been an odd choice to play Jesus but he did alright in my book. How Harvey Keitel was nominated for a Razzie is beyond me because he made a convincing Judas.Overall, this film is a good film about the less-than-perfect Jesus. It has some powerful scenes especially those involving Satan. I feel like this could use a little less talk and some more action to evenly pace it out. Peter Gabriel's score is unexpectedly awesome and fits into the movie. Even to this day, this ranks with The Passion of the Christ as the most controversial movies out there. It has it flaws, but it works on a high degree. I rate this film 8/10.

Harvey Keitel, who plays a pretty decent-sized part, acted the same as he would in any other role. On the other hand, Willem Dafoe did a great job as playing a Jesus that actually had emotion, fears, and of course temptations. A Jesus that was actually human. I'm not a Christian but I still think that the bible is full of great stories, especially the ones surrounding Jesus. Though in all of the passages I've read or been told, I never really felt I could relate to him. I understand that we aren't exactly supposed to be able to relate to the messiah because he is perfect and we are not. But the way he is portrayed in this movie does two things to enhance his story. One it lets the viewer sympathize/empathize with Jesus. Two since he never directly speaks with God, it shows his tremendous amount faith he has in Him by enduring his journey with no real assurance that he's on the right path. Compared to the man in the gospels, I'd much rather believe in the man in this movie.

This movie feels more realistic, mainly because of the way the Jesus character is portrayed in this movie and overall the movie and its story feels far more believable. In the movie Jesus is portrayed as the son of God but as a human of flesh and blood as well. He has hopes, feelings and dreams like every other man.The story is absolutely fascinating. It's a whole different take on the life of Jesus and the person as well. Lot's of things of the famous story have been changed to a more believable and likely story, without too many supernatural elements but with lots of personal struggles and doubts from Jesus about his mission.Jesus is beautifully portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Also good in their roles were Harvey Keitel as Judas-, this movie also provides a totally different view on his character, and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate, in a much smaller role than you would expect from his character.The movie is filled with some unforgettable, original and though provoking moments, especially towards the ending when Christ gets his 'last temptation'. It clearly is not a movie for just everyone. Obviously there will be still lots of people who will be offended by the portrayal of Christ and many other different characters from this movie. But also because the movie is quite artistic and almost poetic like at times in its thought provoking moments, it might be a movie that will simply seem 'odd' to some. So clearly not a movie for just everyone. Still I want to recommend it to everyone so everyone can form their own opinion about the movie its story and characters afterward. Whether you like this movie as a movie, or not, isn't the most important thing. It's the way you feel about the story and the character of Jesus that matters the most afterward.

It attempted (key word) to make Christ seem as an actual human being with feelings and emotions, however, it failed miserably, a trait that was more successful in Kevin Smith's Dogma.The film itself is a mess that Scorsese really proved that he can do mob films and really only mob films.  There was no sense of emotion or passion in this film (pun intended).  It just moved along with Dafoe giving half open mouthed grins of worryment while Harvey Keital gave an incredibly dry and bland performance as Judas.  It was hard to take this seriously from the start mainly because Keital is the furthest thing from being Judas.  Hell, David Bowie doesn't even belong in there as Pilate.  He was better off in Labrynth.  The film drags on way too long with mind boggling numbness, not just because the acting and script is so poor, but also because it is so bogus and off base to the way Christ's life was.  There was a point at the end where Christ as an old man was approached by the aging Diciples, one of which was Judas (another bad Keital delivery coming).  Now, in this temptation hallucination, it is from when Christ is on the cross on.

This is an adaptation VERY loosely based on the life of Christ. Kind of a What if... scenario. It seems the director derived great enjoyment out of gleefully tearing down anything even close to an icon. In some ways this is good, as icons need to be closely examined, however, i found the replacement of those icons with such a plain, base and lifeless caricatures depressing.Basically as i watched this movie it became fairly clear that not much thought was put into it. It's basically taking everything buddy learned in Sunday school and puking all over it, trying to offend as many people as possible in the process. (Good for publicity).  The Bible leaves all sorts of room to paint your pictures of these characters with so much colour, however, Scorsese's vision, (and i'm guessing Kazantzakis's as well, having never read the book) is dull and lifeless, instead reducing the characters to the most two dimensional people imaginable. i'm hoping that someone in the near future will actually have the guts to portray these people full of laughter, tears, Joy and suffering. With mischief and fun as well as sorrow. As human and not either saints or mental deviants...   i found it humorous to note that Judas is the only level headed one in the bunch. Typical hollywood mentality. *****SPOILERS***** Instead of a carpenter raised as a Nazarite and full of charisma, we're faced with a pathetic whining coward who can't tell the difference between Satan's voice and God's voice and who builds crosses for a living. (What a joke!) One HAS to question how someone like this could ever get ONE person to follow him let alone a movement.  John The Baptist is some wacked out crazy who doesn't know who Jesus is (and what's with the naked women dancing at the baptism???), Lazarus is a zombie, Paul is a liar, Judas is a nice guy whom Jesus depends on for his courage and has to PLEAD with to betray him, the women are tatooed (a MAJOR sin in Judaism) the temple in Jerusalem is a charnal house on festival days leaving everyone soaked in blood. Yeesh... it's basically  some guy's take on the story of Jesus having given it a VERY cursory pass and understanding next to nothing about it's context OR Jewish tradition or history. Very strange.But hey!  David Bowie as Pilate was a stroke of genius! And the score was breathtaking. All in all,  though to a Christian this is totally repulsive, it WAS good to see the story from a different standpoint. Though extreme, it was valid in that it's a likely translation of how a regular Joe sees the Bible and how Christians have failed so miserably in portraying it. i give it 5 outta 10 as a movie. Mostly ho-hum, but Bowie and the score redeem it somewhat.i give it 10 outta 10 as a gratuitous money grab. (i've never seen it done better.)i give it 0 outta 10 as a religious statement.

Purely fictional, the film's depiction of Jesus as a self-doubting and none too godly Savior who builds crosses for crucifixions created controversy, not surprising in a decade dominated by escapist entertainment like Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Give Scorsese credit for daring to make a film whose subject guaranteed a quick death at theaters in such a lightweight era. Give Universal even more credit for exploiting the controversy for all it was worth by rushing the film into theaters weeks earlier than planned and contentedly counting bigger grosses than the film would have generated had the Reverand Donald Wildman and other media savvy evangelical types not made such a fuss.  At the time, I, for one, had even suspected Universal of having a few Bible thumpers on its payroll.  After all, the complaints, or, to put it more accurately, the condemnations, pushed the film into the spotlight where it was heatedly discussed on ABC News Nightline, and even The Oprah Winfrey Show.  Though it didn't break any box-office records, it certainly performed beyond earlier expectations.So, did Scorsese's film merit such controversy?  It probably depends on how devoutly religious one is, as well as how open minded.  I'm not too religious, but my mind is open wide enough to accommodate just about anything except, perhaps, murder and child molestation.  Scorsese's film is a real mixed bag.  Fascinating at times, beautiful at others, and occasionally ridiculous.  Except for Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, most of the lead roles are miscast.  Harvey Keitel is a Judas right off the streets of New York, and Willem Defoe as Jesus demonstrates why stardom eluded him even after Platoon and Mississippi Burning.  He's intense, but not always when it's appropriate.  He's the Christ as he would have been played by James Dean.  In smaller roles, Harry Dean Stanton as Saul/Paul, and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate never erase their established images which make them curiosities in a Biblical setting.  Oh yes, and then there's the story  if it doesn't offend, it may inspire a few chuckles.  Jesus struggles against his divinity and as he hangs dying on the cross, is lured down by a golden-haired female angel, and lives to a ripe old age with a wife and family.  It is Judas who informs him, none too diplomatically, of his mistake, exposing the angel as Satan and chastising Jesus for not having lived up to his part of the deal.  Betray me, you said, Judas brays, so I can save the world, but you didn't do your part.  Realizing that he has, indeed, blown it, Jesus begs God for another chance and the film concludes with the Messiah, wearing a crown of thorns resembling a hairnet, back on the cross with a smile on his face.If the screenplay by Paul Schrader and the performances make The Last Temptation of Christ look like a busted pilot for a truly bizarre sitcom, then the cinematography by Michael Ballhaus and the production design by John Beard, as well as Peter Gabriel's haunting score, make it worthwhile, though not enough to justify a running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes. Whatever your religious stance, this film merits a look, although it might be a bewildered one.   "},{"Title":"Who am I!? Where am I!?

(Can you believe it!!??) In my opinion, actor Willem Dafoe certainly made for being an ultimately terrible Jesus Christ character. He really did.Not only did Dafoe totally lack a commanding screen-presence, but, his uninspiring Christ depiction convinced me that Jesus was nothing but a babbling, clueless schizophrenic who actually had conversations with burning bushes and blindly believed that God worked in mysterious ways.Unfortunately, this film's high-handed, little story inevitably deteriorated into a dumb ancient time soap opera where Christ regularly screwed his wife (who was an ex-whore), went on family picnics with his kids, and tragically transformed into one of the biggest couch-potatoes that biblical times has ever seen.My recommendation - Save yourself 2 hours & 40 minutes of blasphemous grief and watch something else instead.

This film dragged on greatly and let me tell you this, a film that is 2 and a half hours but feels like 5 hours has something wrong with it. Now I do not think that that little or big thing wrong with the film was Scorsese. Scorsese is one of the finest directors around today, he has made brilliant films from Taxi Driver to Raging Bull to Mean Streets to Goodfellas, and his camera work here was wonderful, this film was beautifully shot and felt so atmospheric, especially scenes in the desert which did, admittedly captivate me. Dafoe as Jesus was Oscar worthy and certainly played his part with sheer conviction and brilliance, it was a powerhouse and mammoth performance back then and still holds up now. But his supporting cast were no where near the brilliance of Dafoe. Harvey Keitel who can, at times, be one of the best actors around, gives a performance that earned it's razzi nomination. There was no conviction in the acting and it all felt just, wrong. His accent played horribly with the whole scene and I did not think he was a good casting choice at all. The rest of the cast was palpable, with some minor but poorly acted roles from Barbara Hershey and David Bowie, who has no business in the film industry. The Last Temptation of Christ is a one man show as far as acting goes and Dafoe manages to take acting very far. This film had an element of schoolchild-ness to it, it felt like the kind of thing you would watch in an RS lesson on a lazy summer afternoon when the term is drawing to a close. It just felt very long and overplayed, there was very very little entertainment factor to this film and I have doubts that I will ever want to watch it again.

Not because of Christ's (Willem Dafoe) scourge and crucifixion, but because of a fork in history---Christ choosing the life of an ordinary man. This concept could be considered Gospel-bashing (with a very strong case in the Gospel's favor) or it could be viewed as a could-have-been reality (not as easy to get across when discussing Biblical doctrine). Needless to say the movie was a powder-keg when released in 1988 as Christ's relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) ends up being the most heated focus. Discussing the Son of God and sexuality is something that is just better left alone. Thus the movie just never feels right. Judas Iscariot (a wonderfully wicked turn by the always dependable Harvey Keitel) is constantly portrayed as a strange sort of soothsayer, someone who knows what each person is destined to do. He is shown as Christ's closest friend and sometimes even the voice of reason. The Savior's mother (Verna Bloom) is basically ignored all together and we have a historically jumbled appearance of Saul of Tarsus who was later called Paul (played by Harry Dean Stanton). Saul did not live during the same time period so we have another manipulation (albeit very sneaky) of New Testament teachings. Director Martin Scorsese (Oscar-nominated) and screenwriter Paul Schrader are really in way over their heads from the word go. Using that dark Taxi Driver and Raging Bull humor feels forced and you find yourself watching through clenched eyes.

I'm sure that before, and during the filming of The Last Temptation of Christ; the highly acclaimed director thought that this was going to be his masterpiece, but, of course, it hasn't gone down as such. The film does suffer from several flaws, and while much of it is very good; it cannot be seen as one of Scorsese's crowning achievements because the flaws bring it down. I'm not a massive fan of crime films, and so I don't consider Martin Scorsese to be one of my favourite directors. It's a shame that so much of his repertoire is in the crime genre because when he's stepped out of it, the results tend to be quite good. Rather than making a film about the 'classic' story of Christ, Scorsese has opted to base the film on the writing of Nikos Kazantzakis, from his book 'The Last Temptation of Christ'. This story follows Christ as a much less admirable character, and we see him as he leads his disciples to Jerusalem. Jesus is tormented by the fact that he is the Son of God, and the story ultimately comes to him trying to resist the temptation of living the life of a normal man.Like all films dealing with Christianity, this one is controversial and has, and no doubt will continue to, annoy people. The Passion of the Christ had the Christian church up in arms in 2004, but that was controversial for a different reason. Mel Gibson's film depicted an unrelenting account of Jesus' torture and racial controversy over the saviour's murderers; but Scorsese's film is arguably even more potent in terms of controversy as it strikes straight at the jugular of Christian ideology. Rather than being violent or racist, Scorsese's film attempts to defile the entire belief system surrounding Jesus, and presents Christ as more of a cult leader than the great saviour. Scorsese goes a bit over the top with the music at times, which can be irritating and William Dafoe, while no doubt a great actor, doesn't quite do the role justice here. His persona fits the personality that this story has given Jesus, but the actor just doesn't fit the figure and it doesn't come off very well. Harvey Kietel co-stars in the movie as Judas, and it feels like we're watching him in one of Scorsese's crime flicks for most of the movie. In spite of it's flaws, however, The Last Temptation is an interesting film and well worth seeing. Just don't go into it expecting greatness.

It is not really an accurate film about the historic figure of Christ, since the character bears little resemblance to him.  Neither is it a religious film, since Scorcese shows little reverence for his subject.As the movie begins, Jesus tells the audience that he has been hearing voices.  We then see Jesus back at home and hard at work carving a cross for the Romans, who are preparing to crucify a Jewish prophet whose only crime seems to have been to announce that the Messiah was coming.  Jesus is confronted by Judas Iscariot, a supposed friend of his, who belates Jesus for cooperating with the Romans in crucifying his fellow Jews.  You are worse than they are, he yells at Jesus.After the crucifixtion of the hapless prophet, during which Jesus actually drives the nails into the prophet's wrists and ankles, Jesus is led by his voices to the village of Magdelene, where he finds his childhood friend Mary in a brothel.  Having arrived at the brothel, he then proceeds to sit on the floor in front of Mary's bed and watch her work her magic on the other men in the room.  Only after everyone has finished visiting Mary does he suggest to her that her profession may not be an ideal line of work, and she responds by questioning his manhood.  As Jesus travels around Judea, he meets different people, most of whom are wiser than he.  Perhaps the most meaningful interaction is the one he has with John the Baptist, who is heading a baptism movement.  The movement, like most of the events in this movie, has sexual undertones.  When Jesus tells John that he preaches love, John tells him that God is not about love, he is about the ax.  After watching a crowd of people try to stone Mary Magdelene to death for adultery, he becomes convinced that John was right and fills with anger.  He tells the crowds that come to hear him speak that he will burn them and that he is building an army.What makes the film problematic is not that Jesus is tempted by the very human desire to have a wife and children, and to avoid suffering, but that he is shown as morally weak, and as Mary Magdelene put it pitiful. Some people may object to seeing Jesus flogged and crucified naked, but that is how the Romans did these things.  True, seeing Jesus naked is akin to seeing you brother or father naked, and is sure to make you wince if you have an ounce of reverence for him.  Perhaps the most disconcerting scene is the sex scene between Jesus and Mary Magdelene.  If Scorcese would have shown Mary with a baby after marrying Jesus, we would have gotten the picture.As a film, it is largely well done.  The music and visuals are beautiful, and Jesus' miracles are shown better than they have been in some other films (particularly the casting out of demons).  However, the part of the movie between Jesus' removal from the cross and his return to it (you have to see the movie to know what I am talking about) is too long.Scorcese puts a disclaimer at the beginning of the film that the movie is not based on the gospels, but on a fictional novel.  The problem is that the movie still deals with a historical figure and the center of a major religious movement.  Furthermore, Scorcese puts enough of the gospels into the movie to twist Jesus' words.  If Scorcese wanted to show the eternal struggle between body and spirit, he should have found a fictional character to show it, not someone who actually lived.  Scorcese's treatment of Jesus' life goes beyond mere creative license, and borders on character assassination.

I will admit the movie was well made and the acting was very good; however, I must protest greatly the way Jesus is portrayed in this film. When I watched this film it was with a curious mind.  I heard that there are controversial things that are discussed in the film and I wanted to see what all the talk was about.  What I found was a nicely made movie but a slanderous story and ending.  Although the writer tries to redeem himself in the end by putting Jesus back on the cross to die for our sins is no good. Why you may ask?  Because at that point it was pointless to put Jesus back on the cross.  Jesus is supposed to be the spotless lamb to be sacrificed for our sins.  Once Jesus came off the cross he sinned. And then he kept sinning after sin after sin.  Some people may take this entire temptation sequence as a simple hallucination, but mind you, even in a hallucination people still have the ability to know right from wrong.When I saw Jesus being taken off the cross I was about to pull the tape out of the VCR and destroy it, but instead I watched on hoping that Jesus would go back before it was too late.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  This is a warning to all you who have just met Christ and have welcomed him into your heart, Don't see this movie!  It will only clog your mind with false images of Christ and keep you from knowing who he really was.  For everyone else, I am not going to tell you not to watch it but what I am going to tell you is that if you do watch it remember the disclaimer at the beginning. This is purely a work of fiction and NOT IN ANY WAY connected with the true Christ who died for our sins.  "},{"Title":"No redemption for this one. No pun intended.","Date":"12 September 2008","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Most critiques of The Last Temptation of Christ turn around the premise that the film is blasphemous and pornographic. In fact it is; however, the controversy seems to me a bit superfluous, since on purely cinematic grounds, it is not a good movie, easily Martin Scorsese's worst. But I guess The Last Temptation of Christ necessarily attracted attention due to the brand name of its director.And Scorsese's brand of story interpretation is on full display here. For Scorsese, anything that does not push some sort of envelope of decency does not go far enough. Here's the thing, though in a film that does not seek to denigrate Christianity or Catholicism, WHAT is the interest in showing Christ kiss men on the lips, getting stripped naked on the Cross and fantasizing about consummating a marriage with Mary Magdalene? The answer, of course, is provocation for the sake of provocation. When I was a schoolboy we usually categorized schoolchildren who did that sort of thing as bullies, and no one who had a hand in making or promoting (including by the writing of glowing reviews of) this film can credibly claim to be shocked by the reaction it aroused.But of course, provocation is only typically Scorsesean. And if it were the only cinematic flaw in this movie, it might not - apart from the religious aspect - have so severely dented the watchability of this movie. (Casino, Goodfellas and The Departed were all highly enjoyable despite and at times even because of their excesses.) Alas...An introspective into the burden of a dual nature (Divine/human) on the human side of Christ might sound (to some) salaciously tempting in theory, but is a bit thornier to work out in practice. If one accepts the existence of a dual Divine/human nature as a reality (even within a fictional universe), one would at least expect the Divine nature would thwart the worst visceral reactions of the human nature. Yet Scorsese's insistence on showing raw emotion in its most direct form for provocative reasons seriously damage the credibility of Dafoe's Jesus. There were other, more subtle ways he could have emotional burdens that may not even require much alteration to a stoic facial expression. Again, though, Scorsese and subtlety are like oil and water, and so this sort of task is simply beyond him.Then there's the script. Of course it takes lots of liberties with the Gospel account - this is Hollywood we're talking about, of course. But the parts that ARE based on Gospel text are immediately obvious to anyone who has read the Gospel accounts, and the only attempt that is made to weave actual quotes from Christ into the rest of the fabric is the total destruction of their elegance and lyricism in favor of short, banal quips that would have made a Soviet Bloc propaganda copywriter moan in exasperation. (Imagine a Biblical translation that changed This is my Son, with Whom I am well-pleased to Atta-boy! and you start to get an idea of how flat-out *bad* this is.) I would trash the acting, as well, if not for the fact that no one could have made good out of this.Finally, there's the production values. The cinematography is amateur and, I daresay, wholly unworthy of Scorsese. The sets and costumes are bland and boring if you have any sense of period accuracy, and given what we saw over a decade and a half later in The Passion of the Christ, it's not too much to say that these already-inadequate props have aged quite badly.Overall, a bad film. It may be blasphemous to God, but it's also a travesty to the great art of cinema.

To remind us that God was calling us to something deeper, greater, more fulfilling and ultimately glorious for our sake and His glory.It is, as was stated in the films opening credits (if only Christians had paid attention to that short little disclaimer and explanation), a portrayal of the struggle between the flesh and the spirit.

I had heard it was controversial but knew none of the details surrounding the complaints. As the film begins it gives a portrayal of Jesus as a tormented, self abusing, schizophrenic, lunatic of a man plagued by voices. He knows he is the chosen Messiah or Savior and hates God for making him be the One. In order to defy God and maybe make Him change His mind, Jesus makes crosses for the Romans to crucify his fellow countrymen on. Judas, an acquaintance of Jesus is a somewhat honorable man who is a political zealot wanting to break away from and overthrow Roman rule. As a side note, the only thing Biblically accurate about the story so far are the names of the characters nothing else. After Jesus was suddenly healed from the voices, he decides to follow God's will and complete his task (but to point out, he acts like a person with multiple personalities throughout the entire film). So he begins preaching, not out of divine inspiration as he has no relationship with God whatsoever, but simply to create a following and gain power, control, and a momentum for his cause. He makes up stories and has no wisdom or even any idea of what he is talking about. In the film he is depicted as a man who is on a spiritual journey himself, trying to get rid of his sin (when in reality he was sinless), trying to find his own way in the world, making up things and figuring it out as he goes. He even admits through the film that He does not know what he is doing or anything about the world. He changes his stance and worldview many times throughout the film sometimes preaching of love other times messages of hate, fear, anger, and violent revolution. He calls himself the Saint of Blasphemy and comes Not to bring peace but the sword. This reminds me of John 1247 where Jesus really proclaimed the complete opposite For I did not come to condemn the world, but to save it, and also in the garden when being arrested he stops the disciples from trying to defend him saying Put your sword back in its place... for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Nothing in this matches up at all with the Jesus of the Bible. His sermons were half imagined by the writers and the other half were random phrases taken from the Bible and skewed into whatever they wanted to say. It was quite ridiculous in how out of context it all was. While Jesus was fully God and fully man, they wade him out to be a guy who one day just decided that he wanted God to make him a God. He was given a very arrogant personality and went around proclaiming that he was the Messiah which if you read the Gospels Jesus never does. The film was simply full of bad theology, unhistorical, inaccurate and completely in contradiction to Christian and Jewish ideals.The big turning point in the film was when Jesus comes down from the cross and lives his life out as a normal man ignoring God's plan which he was to fulfill. At this point I thought Now I definitely see why this is so controversial. It only got worse from there with the scenes of Paul the Apostle manipulating people, or the angelic child telling Jesus that There is only one woman in the world, one woman with many faces, this one falls and another one rises. If you stopped the film there, as I am sure many angry viewers did, you would be left with the impression that the film's message was Christianity is a farce. Up to this point it had turned me off and had me completely fooled and to my wonderful surprise a huge ingenious plot twist came up. I had been tricked just as Jesus had all along with the angelic child being Satan the whole time. This was Jesus' last temptation. It revealed that this was just an alternate reality Jesus was hashing out in his mind of what could have happened if he were to have left the cross.I am sure that most of the people who criticize this film are Christians who have never even seen it, but I would also argue that those who highly praise it have never heard the real story or failed to understand its meaning. It was good that it showed Jesus' human side but it was horribly inaccurate and deeply flawed story.As far as movie-making goes, I thought the acting was good, the directing fine, but the writing was terrible. The cinematography was wonderful with incredible imagery, especially the desert scenes. It was appealing to the eye and a beautiful work of art. One positive about the plot was that unlike Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ which focuses mainly on Jesus' torturous end, it tells the story (or at least attempted to) of his life which is why his murder was significant. The ending was brilliant and redeemed the film a little, but it was not enough. If only the first two thirds of the movie could have been as good as the ending.

However, I found the director's spin on what is a highly familiar story to be all the more effective because of the controversy.In fact, it's not QUITE as controversial as I had been led to believe, because for much of the time it's a fairly traditional retelling of Christ's last days on earth. Sure, the sex and violence are more explicit than in many a more family-oriented production (although this is relatively tame in comparison to Mel Gibson's later PASSION OF THE Christ) but the format is familiar.Much of the controversy stems from the last thirty-minute section in which Christ experiences a vision whilst on the cross of what his life would have been had he lived to old age. It's by far my favourite part of the movie, and a masterful way of exploring just what he gave up by sacrificing himself. Of course, it helps that Willem Dafoe gives a tremendous turn as Jesus, all repressed anger and pathos. All in all, this is a worthwhile effort and a must for fans of Biblical productions.

I am a Christian, and I love this movie. I think the Christians who are offended by this movie do not understand it. In my particular Christian faith, we believe that Jesus had to endure all the pain and suffering of mankind, including TEMPTATION. Having said that, I think the disclaimer at the first is more or less true. It is using the life of Christ as a basis, but then goes in it's own directions in some areas. My dogma believes the Bible to be the word of God, but that there are translation errors in it. I think the scenario of Jesus asking Judas to betray him is not outside the realm of possibility But, leaving my own faith for a moment. This movie does NOT suggest that Jesus was mortal!! I don't understand how people can say that it does. Also, I have read the book. The book does not suggest this either. I did enjoy the movie much more than the book. Not that the book wasn't well written. I just like the directions that the movie went in. I agree with the review that says this movie has many Christian messages. It does not in anyway promote atheism. I say this having seen this movie many, many times. The author (I suck at spelling so I won't attempt to spell his name) was admittedly Christian. Scorcese is Christian. Just because the Pope it was an evil movie does not mean it promoted athesm (see what I mean, I can't spell) I think some people read TOO much into the movie. It is a portrayal of the human side of Christ's life and legacy. An area that is usually avoided in Christian discussions because not a lot is known about it. Do I believe everything in the movie? No. But there are interesting artistic licenses in the unknown areas. Scorsese (man, I can't spell) said he enjoyed making this movie, and remembering his own faith that he was brought up in. He know that some would be offended by it, but felt blessed to have the opportunity to make it. He thought it was a beautiful story and he felt he had a lot to offer it, but still wanted to stay true to the book. Now, I am not a Catholic, and Catholics may be upset by this, but I mean no offense. there are translation errors in the bible because the early Catholic church decided what went in and what went out. How did they do this? By matching up what they were currently teaching, and anything that didn't fit that was tossed aside as heresy. This movie has many things in it that are in the so called lost books of the bible. So i'm not surprised that many Catholics are offended by this movie. Now, I do not mean any disrespect to the Catholic Church. Their early leaders had a large part in the current construct of the bible, therefore they don't like some of the things that are not in it. That's just fine. I understand that. Okay, maybe I got off topic here. But basically, I think people read too much into what this movie is trying to say. Yes there are some very strong thematic elements. But when you get into does it suggest Christ was mortal or does it promote Christianity...It's a movie!!! The writer was Christian. the filmmaker was Christian. What were they trying to say? Who cares. WHAT DID IT SAY TO YOU? THATS THE IMPORTANT QUESTION. I think both the writer and the filmmaker would agree with me on that. If it gave you a certain feeling on a subject, whichever side it is, who's to say you shouldn't have felt that???

He is limited, even narrow, he does not have a world-view (or at least one worth mentioning), and his appeal is one of an exploitation director (exactly like with De Palma and with the truer, early Coppola). It is highly relevant that Tarantino selects so many of Scorsese's flicks in his favorite films lists. Scorsese is in no way a great director, even less an &#133;author (apart from the minimal understanding, that calls author any person that expresses certain aspirations and intentions). His worst films are typically abstract and lifeless. I never understood the accusations of blasphemy directed at this adaptation; they come from a misconception. The controversy rests upon a misunderstanding. It is true that borrowing some Christian elements treated like obsolete mythology is debatable, objectionable, inappropriate, even lousy&#151;but that's all. Scorsese's twisted epic is a slapdash of narcissist delusions about the fate of the man of genius, about the condition of the extraordinary man&#151;the Biblical setting is only a pretext. This subject is approached by the hack Scorsese with all the clumsiness required. Liking much this dirty piece of self&#151;indulging defines exactly the level of a viewer (like FORREST GUMP and other such phony masterpieces for the philistines). Bunuel, to give THE example, had a taste and a talent for blasphemy, for sacrilege. His thoughts are as void and hollow, yet his film hurts, upsets. But Scorsese' s fantasy is, on the contrary, quite inoffensive and bland. It is too dumb, too kitschy, too schmaltzy and Ebertian to be offensive. Both Scorsese and his writer (and, for this matter, their Greek literary source) are the delight and pride of the philistines&#151;dwarfs masquerading as giant blasphemers. I knew Scorsese was narrow, uncultured and intellectually negligible&#151;I did not need this prove. Scorsese wants to speak about the man of genius&#151;as understood by the pal who was to make CAPE FEAR. Egotistical, narcissist delusions and fantasies on a Christian pretext. What if Christ were not the Christ? The flick is not interested into demythologizing or being religiously controversial, but aims at installing a provincially valid understanding of the misfortunes of the genius. Since nothing else is added ,this is too little to make a film. It is immediately visible, it is too obvious that this Greek&#151;Italoamerican Gospel is not about the Christ&#151;whence this idea?&#151;but a third&#151;rate reflection upon the condition of the genius, the superior man&#151;that is, what the Scorsese/Schrader tandem understood of it (terribly little, I must say &#133;). The movie is not at all about Christ or Christianity, it does not speak about them; if it is a blasphemy, it is only in an indirect way&#151;by its nonchalance in borrowing some elements from what it obviously treats as mythology. Bunuel's blasphemies, or Fellini's, were indeed about Christ or the Church; Scorsese's films is not. The indignation of those who vocally accuse it are misplaced. The flick can be accused of borrowing these elements; but its intention is not to speak about the Christ&#151;but about the genius, the artist, etc..Yes, it is kitsch, eerie and uncanny. But it's the eeriness of a barren ,deserted, empty heart. The blasphemy, even if intended (which it is not) is uninteresting and insipid.

It draws strongly from the Greek's megalomania; it shows once again how far is the Hollywoodian cannon from any relation with the genuine spirituality.

Still, The Last Temptation of Christ does an interesting job looking at him. We see Jesus (Willem Dafoe) as an imperfect human being with his own personal problems. Many Bible-thumping ideologues objected to this movie, due to its portrayal of Jesus' sexual life; all that I can say is If the guy didn't have sex, what would he have done? Now, the movie's weird aspect. Aside from the fact that Spiderman's Norman Osborne is playing Christ, Verna Bloom - aka Marion Wormer in Animal House - plays Mary, and Harvey Keitel plays Judas. All the Jews in the movie have American accents, while the Romans sound like Brits. But don't get me wrong; this is still a good movie. Maybe Martin Scorsese is an odd choice to direct a biblical epic, but whom do we want to do it? The biblical epics made in the '50s and '60s were boring as hell, and I heard that The Passion of the Christ was basically an anti-Semitic screed. My favorite biblical epic is Life of Brian.Here's what I think that they should do. A movie version of the Bible hosted by Jon Stewart. The cast members are all Jewish-American entertainers. For example, Goldie Hawn and Woody Allen play Eve and Adam (for PC purposes, Eve comes first); they behave like a pair of tensed-up artistic people. Dustin Hoffman is Joseph (with the coat of many colors); when the Pharaoh's wife comes on to him, he says Mrs. Pharaoh, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?. Harrison Ford plays Moses; he splits the Red Sea with a light saber, and when he gets the Ten Commandments, it's done like the opening sequence in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Other cast members would include Carl and Rob Reiner, Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder, Elliott Gould, Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Billy Crystal, Kevin Kline, Richard Dreyfuss, Weird Al Yankovic, and others. At the end, Jon Stewart would say that the Bible was made into a movie...called Saturday Night Fever. He would then walk down the street a la John Travolta while Stayin' Alive gets played, and go to a discotheque. Yes, the Bible would end in a discotheque. Call me crazy, but that would be my ideal Bible.

For starters, all the Jews have American accents (Yeah man, so awesome dude) and the Romans have British accent (ooh rather chaps, I say tallyho, what?). These seems to be the only two accents Hollywood will allow characters to have (unless you're senator Arnie). Also unlike Passion, they speak English. So what we have is basically a very American Jesus (and you though Costner was bad in Robin Hood). Willem Dafoe is probably the worst choice in history to play Jesus. He doesn't seem particularly serious about his role here (you are VERY aware he's an American in this movie). He seems to be playing his usual sort of role rather than a messiah. He's a pretty sex-obsessed Jesus. Whenever he sees Mary Magdalene, sex is not far from his mind. Mary is a prostitute in this movie, despite it is never once stated that she was in the bible. He sits there watching her do a client and he's obviously getting off on it (despite him teaching that it was a sin, so obviously this person can not have died for us as he is not without sin). And at the wedding he gets drunk! Now there is no religion that does not consider drunkeness a sin, so again Jesus sins. Jesus is making crucifixes. So this person who is supposed to be without sin is helping make devices for a public killing? Where does it say he did this in the bible? Also it says that his first miracle was making the blind person see, despite the bible saying that the water to wine was the first miracle. Harvey Keitel is the most unrealistic portrayal of Judas I have ever seen and deservedly was nominated for a razzie award. Judas is much braver and wiser than Jesus and much more devout and loyal than St Peter. Even though the bible states that he betrayed Jesus for money, the film decides to make up its own story about Judas and say Jesus told him to. If Judas was the most devoted why would Jesus ask HIM to do it?! Obviously the director decided to give Judas, Peter's role cause Judas is far more obedient, loyal and a closer friend to the one who was given the keys to heaven. Scorsese direction is lousy. He basically makes the characters act like all his other movies. New York mobsters. The characters seem like New York Jews, not ancient Jews. Even if they had changed the accents, you would be very aware that they are American. I think maybe if this had been more like an American-retelling of the Jesus story, set in modern times and dress, it wouldn't have been as bad because apart from the clothes and sets, that's what it seems to be. The whole principal cast is pale faced Americans and British (despite living in the desert), but everyone in the background is dark. Uh, hello, this doesn't make sense. Of course the famous scene where they show Jesus having a vision where he marries Mary Magdalene(now EVERYONE is assuming Jesus was doing her and that is the only reason a female would be allowed. Quite a sexist view really). And Scorsese got really horny directing and couldn't help putting a sex scene in (he must have had his hand down his pants when he directed that scene). I don't see how this is a temptation. Jesus basically gets to live a normal life (he gets to have his cake and eat it to), then he realises this is a temptation. So he asks to die on the cross. Not a hard decision, to go on the cross and live for 4 more seconds of pain, not the hardest thing to do. It seems that he got to live the life he wanted, then at the last moment, got to die for us as well. You can't have both, but Horny Martin Scorsese gave him both. This doesn't seem fair. To have a live of sex and freedom, but also get to die for our sins as well. There is a lot of nudity (you see everything for the females here) in this film and the sex scenes are almost pornographical. I can't believe Australia gave this an M rating. He doesn't wear a crown of thorns, he wear a skullcap of thorns. The thorns are large and long, so if they had really been pushed into Jesus' brain, they would have caused brain damage and he wouldn't have been able to move, let alone carry his cross. Also Jesus is crucified naked, with his legs lifted up, so he can tuck his penis between his legs. This kinda defeats the purpose as the condemned men, lifted up there legs to avoid suffocation. Also the Romans would not let Jesus to be crucified nude(he's so horny throughout this movie, it's a miracle he didn't have an erection). They respected the Jewish laws (Jesus' crucifixion was a Jewish-made request) and would not have allowed a naked body to be shown, knowing there was to be women there who by law were not allowed to view any naked body other than their husbands. If you want to see a close deception of Jesus watch the Passion. If you want to watch Jesus acting and talking like a New Yorker, being a sex-maniac and acting like a confused loser, watch this. The bible teaches us that Jesus was both God and man. This one tries to claim he was simply man cause there's no way God could be represented as such a bi-ploar person on the edge of a nervous breakdown. This movie is so silly, it's impossible not to laugh, let alone take it seriously. Watch Passion, not this.

The film, yes.  As an art form, well, I'll get back to this later. Although it has been repeatedly been discussed over a decade, I still think that this film has not fully been criticized properly from a religious point of view.  First of all, it is mere naivety to claim that this has little to do with Christianity.  The film touches the core of Christian religion, so cope with it i.e. should you wish to present a valid criticism of this film, for heaven's sake get familiar with the Bible first!  Don't be gullible about one certain peculiar interpretation presented by Kazentzakis. Still, you may say that this is art, not necessarily aimed to bring about historical and theological accuracy.  In other words, one may say that artists have their prerogative to modify or even pervert 'truth', or that they can exercise creativity.  I suppose they do, but that does not bring us to the point.  The point is (or was, rather) whether they had the sensibility to think about billions of 'Christian population' who love, believe, cherish, follow, and hope for the figure at stake, Jesus.  Some seem to dismiss them as 'narrow-minded' or as ' fundamentalists (can you precisely identify who they are??)' who are incapable of tolerating the film.  But I say, they are right to be mad!

However, after the latter film left me so numb, I thought it was best to leave films dealing with religion and Jesus Christ dormant for a while due to that film being so heavy and jarring in its depictions of violence and graphic content. I made the wise decision, for a college course I'm currently enrolled in called religion and ethics in film has kicked off by showing The Last Temptation of Christ in its entirety, allowing free-form discussion and conversation to take place regarding its allegedly blasphemous depictions of Jesus Christ and the gospels along with its radically unconventional approach to biblical characters.Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader create the most original works involving our Lord and Savior that I, and undoubtedly countless others, have ever seen. The film involves Jesus Christ (played by Willem Dafoe) as a man entirely unsure of himself and his own ability to be the strong, reliant son of God. The film opens showing Jesus Christ making crosses for the Romans to crucify Jews on, already kicking off the film on a note of complete shock to anyone who has read and studied the gospels. In the film, Jesus is close friends with Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), who deviates from his role in The Bible dramatically to frequently challenge and question the motivations of Jesus Christ while simultaneously trying to believe he is the noble messiah that is to be trusted and followed. Finally, there's the third central character of the film, Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), who has turned to prostitution following Jesus's rejection of her offers of fulfilling his sexual desires.Throughout the film, Jesus is tempted by many things, such as doubt, depression, uncertainty, fear, and lust, prompting visions of carrying out sexual desires with women. Initially, any devout or simply practicing Christian will look at The Last Temptation with an understandable uneasiness about such narrative inclusions like Jesus carrying out sexual desires, or even being uncertain and fearful of his taxing responsibility to carry out the word of God. Your response to such ideas is dependent on how open you are about hearing a different, pragmatic take on the life of Jesus Christ rather than the frequently institutionalized, dehumanized version of the messiah.We see Jesus Christ not as a holier-than-thou messiah, or a bold and confident individual, sure of the gospel and his duty granted by an almighty god, but instead, a deeply bashful, neurotic soul, grappling with the idea of being both one-hundred percent man and one-hundred percent God. As a result, we get perhaps the most human (notice I didn't say faithful) adaptation of Jesus Christ ever put to film, one that doesn't blind us with the glow of his metaphorical halo and holiness and one that doesn't resort to caricaturing. Despite taking massive creative liberties, Scorsese and Schrader seem to have a great deal of respect for the messiah, as they care about him enough to give him an identity beyond institutionalized scriptures and sloganeering.Furthermore, the humanization of Christ allows Christians to see their Lord and Savior in a light they likely hadn't previously thought of because of such sloganeering. It's strange and unconventional to see a leader be portrayed as bashful and doubtful in himself, but such feelings were likely to be felt by Jesus in at least some manner. Imagine existing as both a man and a god of some kind, burdened by the dictation of a higher power you, yourself, didn't understand, who wanted you to preach the gospel to many who would hate or doubt you, effectively preventing you from carrying out any relationships of your own and grappling with your own sanity? The fact is you cannot imagine it because it's too overwhelming to even conceptualize; it's not of this natural world.Regardless of how you want to view The Last Temptation of Christ, one cannot deny its ability to provoke some kind of feeling between believers and non-believers. It's a film that sits with you, unnerves you, and plays with your emotions in the best possible way. When it was over, the class I was surrounded by was surprisingly vocal, many of whom either shocked about the Jesus Christ they saw or maturely criticizing what they had seen unfold. One woman even said the film was dangerous because it has the potential to give someone unfamiliar with the gospel a completely different and false idea of Christ. I sat back and listened in silence, as I was processing what I just saw, uncertain but confident I witnessed the closest thing to a cinematic miracle I have yet to see; a film with enough gall to reject convention and paint one of the oldest known stories with brushstrokes that weren't broad but specific and clear.Read the full, more complete review on my personal website, http//tinyurl.com/qfeayhj "},{"Title":"controversial Martin Scorsese film","Date":"16 December 2014","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is conflicted by the voice in his head.

Ultimately, as a character, he's uncompelling, and his struggles left me more unattached than interested in their outcome.I'll grant this For one moment, in the Garden of Gesthemane, Jesus almost came to life, tormened, wracked with agony. But the moment quickly faded, along with hopes for the movie.Worse, the last temptation experienced by Jesus was a sellout. Jesus never actually made a choice between two things; he had his cake and ate it too, living his first choice to its natural conclusion before going back and taking the other road. In so doing, he actually sacrificed nothing but had it all. Savior? Sacrifice? The notions are irrelevant here.For a cast full of truly top-rate actors, most performances were either over-the-top or flat and underwhelming.

So there's no reason why anybody else should feel angry when two major Catholics made this movie possible. I tried to put my religion aside and focus on the movie aspect, that's what it's all about. In every aspect of a movie, this rides high, some higher than others. The biggest achievement was the acting. Acting is one of my biggest concerns and one that I usually judge most. The entire cast was sensational, but of course, Dafoe shines the most as a doubtful Jesus Christ. He really deserved an Oscar win for his powerhouse performance. I'd say he was the closest to being at par with Robert Powell in Jesus Of Nazareth, whom I think is the best Jesus. If Dafoe was casted as Jesus in a nonfiction movie of Jesus's life, more people would have praised him. What I love about this too is that is tells why Jesus had to do what he did and why we need God in our lives. This actually gives straight answers that people always question. So that part is good that everyone must admit. The content is too harsh for people. Either way, this is one that people must experience at least once. Movie buffs and actors need to own this.

The theory that Jesus didn't exist, but is instead a plagiarism from earlier Pagan myths, usually said to be superior to their later generation knockoff, and which ultimately is tied to Astrotheology and the Cycle of the sun throughout the Heavens annually.In the past I have discussed the absurdity of the Jesus Myth in comparing Jesus with other gods, such as Mithras, Horus and Dionysus, noting that the parallels said to be shared by them simply are not found in the texts of the Religions that spoke of them. Still, I have not spoken often of he Astrology that is said to link Jesus to the Sun and that shows him to perfectly parallel the suns passage through the Heavens, the core value of the Jesus Myth theory.So tonight, on the night the sun god is said to have died, before his three days of death and his resurrection, I will.But first I shall recapitulate the solar myth in brief, and then examine each claim more elaborately.The theory begins with the idea that the sun god is Born on December 25th, three days after the Winter Solstice, and then the rest of his life, from his teaching at the Temple at age 12, to his collecting his 12 Disciples, to his preaching a Sermon on the Mound, to his Death on the Cross and final Resurrection, are simple allegorical allusions t the suns path through the sky each year.According to this theory, the year runs in a Cycle, so that the Birth of the Sun god will be at the same point as his Death, burial, and resurrection. Therefore, we observe the Death pf the sun god at the Winter Solstice, and his resurrection three days later on December 25th which also happens to be his Birthday. Thus, when you reach the end of the sun god myth with his Resurrection, you then begin again at the Start of the story.Of course the parallels may sound compelling when first presented, with clear parallels being shown to match specific events in Jesus' life, but upon closer examination, one soon discovers that that they cannot be substantiated, and in fact you cannot make the sun god theory work.Of course the whole Solar mythology idea is rooted around the idea that the story is an eternal cycle, thus his Birth would occur at the same time as his resurrection. According to the theory, once you reach his Death, burial, and resurrection, you start again, at the beginning, with his Birth. This is all very well and good, but it does leave one to wonder then about Easter.

As controversial as this film may have apparently been considered upon its heated release back in 1988, I think of it now as being pretty tame, lame, and, in the long run, tres' disappointing and uninspiring, indeed.I mean, let's face it, since Christ's last temptation wasn't violating, or breaking, even one of the holy 10 Commandments, then, I ask you, what the heck was all the bloody fuss and public outcry about, anyways? Eh? What? OK. I do admit that, yes, it was pretty low and degenerate of Christ to have actually placed himself in a line of horny men all waiting, like regular, little pigs, for their turn to screw that whore, Mary Magdalene. Yep. That was ultimately a totally stupid thing for Christ to do, considering, if nothing else, that STDs were probably running rampant in those good, old holy days.But, besides that, wouldn't you honestly think that when it came to the temptation of sex for Christ that he would've at least had the bloody sense to round up some nice, little, Jewish virgin from the neighborhood? Surely he could've found one of such chaste purity as that (they did exist in those days) who was more than willing to have Christ break her cherry for her.Personally, I would've enjoyed this movie immensely had Christ actually been tempted into becoming a regular holy-terror-type. Yeah. Christ as a real bad boy.In other words, I was hoping like hell that Christ (out of temptation) would, in fact, start breaking some of the 10 Commandments. Like, perhaps, Christ could've started out by dishonoring his parents. Now, that's always very effective. And, then, maybe, getting a little more daring, Christ could've defiantly not remembered the Sabbath. And, then, as the ultimate climax of temptation, bad-boy Christ could've killed off a few of the 12 Disciples (the real stragglers, of course), for good measure. I mean, there were far too many snobbish, little bores in that elite group, anyways.(Uh... Sorry for making with the jokes here - But, hey! - C'mon, now - This film really did take itself far too seriously for my liking.) All in all - When you really think about the scenario that I've just described above, this is the sort of thing that would've quite rightfully earned this film the kind of controversy that it otherwise (erroneously) garnered for itself over nothing.In a nutshell - This film, concerning Christ dealing with his own self-doubts and eventually accepting himself as The Chosen One, moved along at a literal snail's pace, contained some of the most hypocritically preposterous dialog imaginable, and, if that wasn't disappointing enough, the special effects were so chintzy, as to be downright laughable at times. It was the talking burning bush, in particular, that totally killed me.A Final Warning To All - Do not be in any way tempted by The Last Temptation Of Christ. Its story is misleading, misguided, and mundane. This film is a far cry from being really good entertainment.And, yes, Willem DaFoe's portrayal of Jesus Christ was, amongst other things, insincere and uninspiring.

Unfortunately, that character, played by rock icon David Bowie, is Pontius Pilate, the man who condemns Jesus to death on the cross. Jesus, on the other hand, is played -- rather badly -- by Willem Dafoe as a whiny, self-absorbed, neurotic, bumbling, somewhat stupid, amazingly uninspired, and occasionally hysterical twit.Martin Scorsese's fictionalized -- as if that is a good thing -- retelling of Christ's story is offensive on so many levels that you don't have to be a Christian or even a believer in any faith to be dumbfounded by the sheer ineptitude of the entire project. When Scorsese begins the story with Christ the carpenter busy in his shop using his skills to build a cross which will be used to crucify a fellow Jew, the story has nowhere to go but up. Amazingly, it doesn't the next scene finds Jesus tagging along to lend a helping hand as the Romans carry out the execution. Here is the story of the Prince of Peace, a man worshiped and adored for his belief in nonviolence, forgiveness and human kindness, and the film begins with him helping to commit a state sanctioned killing. One would assume that the filmmaker has a pronounced hatred of Jesus and of Christianity.This presumably is not the case. Benefit of the doubt dictates that Scorsese is genuinely trying to create a sympathetic vision of Jesus. Thus, Scorsese wants us to see Jesus as human, but it is his concept of humanity that the director presents. Being human in Scorsese's eyes is being Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta, one of the savage beasts in GOODFELLAS or any number of psychotic losers that populate his films. The notion that God sent forth his only son to be an example of the best that mankind should strive for fits nowhere into Scorsese bleak and sorrowful mindset. The fact that Scorsese sees the world through such a cloud of contempt is pitiable. The fact that feels the need to vandalize the story of Christ with such a blatant hatefulness is less worthy of forgiveness.Using Paul Schrader's woefully insipid screenplay, Scorsese's film, more or less, follows the standard Gospels, up until a fantasy ending that supposedly justifies the entire film. So it's not the story, it's the telling. Jesus tells a parable about hope and faith and he handles it so badly that his listeners want to riot and kill the rich. He disowns his mother and leaves her crying in the street. Simple questions about faith leave him stammering and dumbfounded. There is not a moment in the film that gives Jesus a chance to show kindness, wisdom, love, charisma or even a shred of dignity. The only element of the film that does work is the climatic dream sequence wherein Jesus imagines what life would be like if he renounced his divinity and lived as an average man. Ironically, once the presence of God is removed form Jesus, the film allows him to actually have genuine positive human qualities.Brushing aside -- as if were possible -- the utter ignorance THE LAST TEMPTATION shows of the Gospels, the film still fails. Aside from Bowie's credible cameo appearance, the actors flounder, either resorting to horribly stilted line readings or else sounding like blue collar workers arguing at the local tavern. Dafoe, however, stands alone playing Jesus like an escaped mental patient, the otherwise competent actor seems to have had not a clue as to who Jesus was and apparently he got precious little guidance from Scorsese. Even Scorsese's admitted technical prowess fails him here; the film is cheap, clumsy and unpleasant to look at.Is the film sacrilege? That is a judgment for others to make. What it is is insensitive. It callously shows contempt for a figure who is revered, not only in Christian faiths, but in Jewish and Muslim faiths as well. To present such a degraded image of Christ, even within a fictionalized or what-if scenario, doesn't excuse the filmmakers from their responsibility to show respect, if not honesty, to the historical, if not religious, importance of the Christ. To hide behind the concept of fictionalization is a cowardly cop-out.This is a cold, hateful and mean-spirited film. The irony is that the Scorsese and his team probably thought they were making a film with great inspirational insight. Forgive them, for they know not what they do.

If it were at least a good film, then a critique would be a hard task. But, with the second-rate low-profile ditty as it is, this is not a problem. I will always guard my kids and my friends against watching this horrid piece of God knows what... I am very sorry for all who like this bad film. This is not Art, this is Nihilism. We all know where it leads at.

Christ, our Lord, suffered the harshest fate, that our lives would be without sin, and this is how we choose to repay him? With contemporary dialogue and bedding prostitutes? No! Let Hollywood continue to make all the remakes and sequels audiences can bare, but leave Jesus alone! Christ did not bed Mary Magdalene! Christ did not WANT to bed Magdalene! Christ followed the wisdom of His father! Let these Hollywood people defame Jack the Ripper if they wish, or Charlie Manson, but please stop portraying Jesus as anything but the saint he was!

He could hurt, love, feel pain and joy, and He could make mistakes just like any of us .. are you kidding me? then i guess anyone could've died on the cross to save us. yes he felt pain, hurt, love, and joy but the way Jesus feels those things are different from our sinful nature. have you read the bible? what mistakes did He make??. Jesus is God in human form. He wasn't born into sin like you and i are from Adam. According to the bible Jesus never had a doubt in who he was. that he is the son of God.. God in flesh and blood. Jesus was tempted by the devil but the only time he showed some weakness was when he was on the cross and said, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? (Matthew 2746). most believe this was because it was about the time Jesus was about to die and since he had NO SIN at all.. he was able to take in our sins, hence died for our sins.. and God who was always with Jesus (deity), had to leave Jesus because God cant be with sin. so that's why Jesus says that. this movie shows Jesus as a human who is righteous but still sinful, give me a break.. Jesus was in the desert when he was tempted..The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, so that the devil could test him. After Jesus had gone without eating for forty days and nights, he was very hungry. Then the devil came to him and said, If you are God's Son, tell these stones to turn into bread. Jesus answered, The Scriptures say 'No one can live only on food. People need every word that God has spoken.'  (Matthew 41-4)that is just one of the many times Jesus was tempted, it shows how strong his faith was.. this movie portrayed him like he was weak. i like a lot of Scorsese movies but as a Christian i take offense to this movie by the way he portrayed Jesus. Scorsese should just stick with gangster movies. if you guys want to learn about Jesus, our savior.. then read the bible instead of some inaccurate mainstream Hollywood crap. plus reading is better for you.and for those of you who think the bible is fiction. then how do you think we got here? big bang? that sounds more ridiculous than anything else. just look at your body outside and inside.. look at your eyes very closely and how the body functions. the body is so sophisticated, even how the earth and the air and how everything comes together for life form. you think a big bang created all this? if you put a bunch of parts from an ipod nano in a box and shake it up for a million years, you think it'll make itself?.. someone would have to put it all together right. the universe and the human body is more complicated than an ipod. we are created by God "}]
