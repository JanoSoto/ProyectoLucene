Everyone knows the plot---a religious cult needs to retrieve a sacrificial ring which Ringo cannot get off his finger, consequently he has to be sacrificed.  The lads go through various adventures in London, Switzerland and the Bahamas before it is all over.  It is easy to imagine this movie being an inspiration for Monty Python later on and it isn't surprising to learn that George Harrison in particlar became good friends with Michael Palin and Eric Idle of Python fame.  Now imagine what a combined Beatles-Python movie would've been like! One scene in Help! which I particularly remember is the Leo Mckern, the cult leader, dressed in his sari, drinking tea and collegially discussing his religious beliefs with an Anglican priest.  Of the Beatles, John and Ringo have most of the funny lines and the movie exaggerates the idea of George being tight with his money---playing poker with Ringo at Buckingham Palace, pilfering rings from a jeweler, pretending he can't find his wallet thus forcing Ringo to pick up the tab at a pub.  The caricature personas the Beatles adopted for this movie in particular became the way many fans viewed them which I think George found to be alternately ironic and irritating since he insisted he was nothing like the movie version of himself.

Meanwhile, a scientist (Victor Spinetti) wants the ring for his own purposes. And of course, there's plenty of great music along the way.In a way, the whole movie is sort of an excuse to be wacky. Whether it's the seemingly separate apartments that turn out to be one big room, the trap door activated by a glass, the skiing tournament, or the whole Bahamas sequence, they've got something neat every step of the way.

This film is certainly all of the above.Dick Lester had a great command of what was going on culturally at the time and his command really shows through in his frenetic directing style. He is definitely a pioneer, and this is a landmark film. You can see the influence of this movie coming out in the colour episodes of I Dream of Jeannie, the Monkees, and 60s cult favourites such as Arabesque.The film is generally fun and enjoyable, but it is a 60s period piece, so it may not be for all.

They're one of the few musical groups that still remain as fresh and entertaining even today.  And that applies to their films as well.  Help! is a lot of fun.  Take the fab four with a  goofy plot of Ringo being the target of religious sacrificial cult, add a handful of great songs, and that's the movie.  The one-liners in this film are still very funny, with plenty of groaners and the typical quick British wit.  Really nice camera work, great sets (the Beatles' apartment showcases clever diversity for each member's personality) and just wild sub-plots throughout the film.  (Paul's tiny adventure and the tank chase comes to mind.)  As I said before, the film's main asset is the music, and one can't help but find themselves caught up in the songs.  The strangest thing in the film is when it abruptly veers away from the cult chase to numerous songs and the Beatles just playing around.  Even with a few more attempts on poor Ringo's finger, it seems like everyone takes a break from the chase.  It really doesn't matter, however.  The Beatles seem to be having a good time, and you can't help but join in.Help! is a great showcase of Beatles music, fun writing and clever visuals.  While not as great as A Hard Day's Night, those who enjoyed that movie will be hard-pressed to find anything wrong here.

It may look weak in comparison to A Hard Day's Night, widely regarded as the Citizen Kane of rock musicals. But it's an easier film for a kid to relate to. Instead of a realistic, ironic mockumentary about the lives of rock stars, it's a harmless escapist fantasy that has precious little to do with the real Beatles. These are the Beatles of myth, the four asexual men who all live in the same house, which is supposed to pass for an automated futuristic type of home, at least to audiences in the 1960s. I suppose that as a kid I got a kick out of the idea of having a vending machine in one's own home. Somehow, I never asked myself what the advantage of that would be, and the film never does, either.Looking back on the film as an adult, I have a hard time determining what it is I liked about it. Certainly, I can't remember laughing at any of the jokes. In fact, I was vaguely aware that most of the jokes fall flat. (In contrast, the Monkees' TV show, modeled heavily on this movie, was often quite funny.) The superintendent who does a bad Cagney imitation and inexplicably begins every sentence with the words So this is the famous.... left me staring at the screen blankly. This is quintessential British humor, revolving heavily around people's nonchalant reactions to bizarre events. It's a brand of humor that has great potential to be funny; here, it's just strange, probably because none of the ideas are all that inspired. The idea of a tiger who likes Beethoven might have sounded good on paper, I suppose, but it doesn't come together on screen. I suppose it could have been used as the setup for a funnier joke; instead, it's used as the punchline. At least I was able to get that joke when I was a kid. Many of the other jokes involve references that went over my head, such as the line It's the brain drain his brain's draining. Those sophisticated enough to know what the brain drain is are likely to be too old to appreciate such a pedestrian pun.The Beatles themselves do not emerge in this film as talented comic actors, to put it mildly. Their line readings are wooden, their comic timing is off, and their apparent attempts at improvisation are pathetic, as in their continual ho ho hoing throughout the film. The Beatles were supposed to have been very funny on stage and in interviews, but none of that ability translates to the screen. It may not have been their fault. The characters they play are given no identifiable traits, and as a result they come off as interchangeable, except for Ringo because of his role in the plot. Instead of giving them distinct comic personas to play, the film turns them into straight-men who are the victims of a zany, insane world that's conspiring against them. This is presumably what led the real Beatles to complain that the film reduced them to extras in (their) own movie.So why do I have so much affection for the film? Probably because I was just sort of enchanted by the events. The movie has a lot of the types of scenes that delight kids, like the aforementioned automated house, as well as a ton of weird gadgets. The various methods in which the Beatles attempt to remove the dreaded ring from Ringo's finger is the best aspect of the film, plot-wise. It may not make me laugh, but there still is a certain pleasure in watching these scenes. Besides, I've always liked movies about Thuggees. Along with Gunga Din, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and a somewhat darker film from 1988, The Deceivers, Help! convinced me that Thuggees were a real group existing in modern times. How disappointed I was when I grew up and eventually learned that the actual cult was destroyed by British forces in the early nineteenth century. Temple of Doom at least alludes to that fact, and bases its plot on the premise that the cult has secretly survived. Help! never explains how Thuggees could be around in the twentieth century; you just have to accept it.But the most obvious reason why I still like this film is the wonderful music. It actually has a better soundtrack, in my opinion, than A Hard Day's Night. Among the songs that Help! popularized are not just the hits like You're Gonna Lose That Girl, Ticket to Ride, You've Got to Hide Your Love, and the title song, but also lesser known tracks like The Night Before and Another Girl. The earlier film appropriately focused on their dance music. The songs from this film have a greater focus on harmony and musical virtuosity.

During this era, they morphed from the innocent fab four into the pre-mystical Beatles that came about in late 1965 with the advent of their wonderful Rubber Soul lp.Yes, I loved these guys from this era of time. If you're old enough to have experienced the British Invasion, then you can show an appreciation of how the music once was short and sweet. To put it simply, most pop music that came out of this era was short (around 2 minutes and 30 seconds) and sweet enough to reveal a new type of rock n' roll that never existed before the advent of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Chad and Jeremy, the Dave Clark 5, etc, etc, etc.It's too bad that this era didn't last long enough for us to enjoy. Before you knew it, it was gone like a morning mist. Even the American versions of garage rock, like Gary Lewis & the Playboys and the Turtles disappeared as discontent with the establishment and Vietnam sapped all of the collective innocence out of us.It was an era of music that was, in essence, non-political; Beatles music, as well as other bands, were geared toward boy-girl love relationships and that was all. Barry McGuire then blew us out of the water with his Eve of Destruction around September, 1965. This, of course, caught the Beatles by surprise and they quickly changed their music from the typical love songs and became more creative in their talents by releasing Day Tripper with We Can Work It Out as a flip side.Help! is a remnant of the final days of innocence, when Vietnam was just entering the nightly news night after night after night and when the domestic disturbances on college campuses and ghettos was coming to a head.This is what Help! represents to those who study this era. It was still a time when we could still help to avoid the problems that were beginning to plague American culture, society and politics. It still showed the Beatles as innocent and fun-loving mop tops that many people still prefer over their re-emergence as mystical, drug-experimenting replacements two years hence. I know that I still prefer them as innocent mop tops, but reality has shown that they were far from innocent even during their early days in Hamburg.All that aside, this is still my favorite era of Beatledom.

Director Richard Lester opted for a plotted spy-caper spoof in glowing colour and if he sometimes piles on too many gags and the boys, if one was being honest, are out-acted by the surrounding talent, this is still an entertaining romp, accompanied by some sublime music as the Fab Four really start to hit their creative stride in their vibrant mid-period.Hanging on to the coat-tails of another of Britain's big entertainment success stories of the 60's, the James Bond movies (the 007 theme even gets an airing at one point), the episodic plot serves its purpose in taking the boys to far-flung exotic locations in which to clown and sing. There are as many good comedic devices as bad, but the best of them pre-date some of the anarchic humour of Monty Python and some of the group interplay echoes, if distantly, the drollery of the Marx Brothers.The film therefore moves at a fast tilt from the off, with the songs reasonably well spaced out. Lennon emerges with the main plaudits with the classics Help!, Ticket to Ride and the mature Dylan-influenced You've Got To Hide Your Love Away. McCartney and Harrison contribute quality high-gloss pop of only slightly lesser standard and all these songs are given entertaining promo-video backings which work well independent of the surrounding whole.The four can hardly be said to be stretched in the acting stakes and more than in A Hard Day's Night seem a bit less individualistic here. Their repartee is shared around so that no one really takes precedence which might of course have been the aim. There's strong support in the mainly British cast, with Leo McKern doing a good comedic turn as the chief thuggee and Eleanor Bron quietly effervescent, often riffing off Paul.The film does drag a little even over its short playing time as it draws to its end, this viewer feeling a little worn down with all the sight gags, changes of perspective and general pop-art enthusiasm of director Lester. That said, it can be seen to encapsulate the swinging times of its genesis, so that in summing up, you know you should be glad (ouch!). "}{"Title":"I am not what I seem!","Date":"28 October 2007","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Musical","Review":" Released in 1964, 'A Hard Day's Night' was a movie classic. 'Help', which came out a year later, had the potential to be better still; a bigger budget, colour, exotic locations, top-notch British character actors of the calibre of Leo McKern, Patrick Cargill, Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear. Yet despite all these plus factors, it turned out to be a major disappointment.Having wisely retained the services of director Richard Lester, producer Walter Shenson inexplicably failed to hold onto writer Alun Owen. Marc Behm and Charles Wood's script for 'Help!' is, frankly, dreadful. The plot - such as it is - concerns a mystic Eastern sect who pursue the Fab Four all over the world in an effort to recover a sacred ring, which has somehow gotten stuck on Ringo's finger. For sheer inanity, it gives the worst of Elvis Presley's celluloid efforts a run for their money. Much of the Goonish humour seems forced, and the cast constantly winking at the audience grows wearing. Sadly missed are Norman Rossington, John Junkin and Wilfred Brambell from the first film.John Lennon later likened 'Help!' to the 'Batman' television series. I think it has more in common with 'The Monkees'. Arch plots such as this were routine in that show.The decision to turn 'Help!' into a larger-than-life action comedy is the main reason for its artistic failure. The pseudo-documentary look of 'Night' suited The Beatles down to the ground; all they had to do was be themselves. Here they are required to react to bizarre happenings, and aren't able to convince themselves, let alone the audience. Their frequent cries of 'ho ho ho' leads one to believe they were so high on pot they forgot they were making a film. Lennon's comment about how they 'became extras in their own film' is accurate. With McKern, Cargill and Spinetti hamming it up outrageously, and Eleanor Bron looking stunningly sexy in Julie Harris' costumes, how could it have been otherwise? The best gags in 'Help!' are visual, such as The Beatles simultaneously entering four houses and being reunited in a single room, and Patrick Cargill getting out of a small plane to be greeted by a massive flight of steps. But the overall impression is one of complacency on the part of the production team. They knew that the film was likely to make a mint, so were not too concerned with minor details such as a script.'Help!' only comes to life when The Beatles perform; the 'Ticket To Ride' sequence in the Austrian Alps is stunning ( love the notes on the telegraph lines ), as is the 'Another Girl' section in the Bahamas. My favourite, though, is 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Away'. Marvellous photography throughout. Its no wonder that Lester later became regarded as the 'father' of M.T.V.An underrated aspect of 'Help!' is the incidental music. Ken Thorne caught the Bond-like atmosphere to a tee, and even includes a clever homage to Monty Norman's 'James Bond Theme' at one point.'Help!' is a relic from the time when The Beatles were conquering the world. Its worth watching for the music, but it could and should have been so much better.

Unless the cameras are fly-on-the-wall filming you in real life, then you're playing a character - that's what a fiction film is all about! And the Beatles played characters based on themselves in both A Hard Day's Night and Help!, it's just that the former film was staged in a more cine-verite manner.Help!, on the other hand, is pure escapist nonsense. It's colourful, it has an actual plot (wildly improbable as it might be), the four Beatles discharge their responsibilities adequately, there are some lovely little throwaway bits of humour (check out Paul, Eleanor Bron, George, and the winking), and above everything, the music is great.Just take it as an opportunity to go back to the summer of 1965 and relish the Beatles providing fun at the height of their popularity!

Unlike 'A Hard Day's Night', 'Help!' takes more of a story approach and is less of a documentary about the lives of the band. Ringo is the star of the show, and this was probably down to his excellent performance in 'A Hard Day's Night'. The film is about a cult who is after Ringo as a human sacrifice because of a ring that he is wearing. Along the way, they meet different characters and different locations in a James Bond style theme. Like 'A Hard Day's Night', the film contains the wacky humour , some good photography, and music clips. The photography is not as stunning as some of the scenes in 'A Hard Day's Night', however. The playing field scene in 'A Hard Day's Night' is a difficult one to beat anyway.I slightly prefer this film to 'A Hard Day's Night' for the story value, and it is much more engaging with less slow-moving, seemingly-unscripted parts. Overall, it is much more focused. Whereas the former is more for Beatles and music enthusiasts, 'Help!' is made for a wider audience who can still enjoy the Beatles music but who can also enjoy the story.

The cult believes it to be necessary for their ceremonies, while the scientists, marveled at the industructable jewelry, imagine themselves quite powerful if they were to own it (kind of like a Beatles version of the Hobbit). Everyone scrambles around in slapstick format like it was Blake Edwards 'The Great Race.' It is so comical and so simple, kids might enjoy the strange atmosphere and slapstick nature of this movie. I particularly like the little joke about the 'Royal Fuse' going out at the substation or when George tells Ringo that he should let them cut off his finger, because he'll get good money from the insurance, and probably more because he's a Beatle.It doesn't matter that the Beatles couldn't act. They didn't stick them in movies expecting to make cinematic masterpieces. They were just vehicles for their music (between scenes, you have your standard mini-videos featuring the famous 'Ticket to Ride' and title song 'Help!), and of course, the Beatles popularity. Their stiffboard expressions actually seem much funnier when compared with these insane people running around after them. Ringo, in particular, as he seems more like the youngest of the bunch, and perhaps, the most naive. I love how everyone disbelieves that anyone is trying to sabatoge him in the beginning, when the cult tries several clandestine and unsuccessful methods of stealing Ringo's ring.The movie does go on a bit too long, as most Beatles movies tend to do. After that George Harrison song 'I Need You' plays during their pseudo-war scenes, the remainder of the film tends to get dragged out a little too far. It would've been better to end it somewhere not far (minutes) once that song passes. It isn't the best of the Beatles movies (Magical Mystery Tour is in my opinion the worst) probably because it lacks the visual beauty and psychadellia that Yellow Submarine had.

This was their follow-up to their amazing A Hard Day's Night, a classic that rates as the greatest rock-band movie ever made.Help pales in comparison to its predecessor and often is criticized deeply for this failure.In the story, Ringo comes into possession of a holy ring that is the honorarium worn by the intended sacrificee of a sect of Khaili worshipers (Khaili is the Hindu god of death and destruction). The sect goes through stages of trying to get the ring back, to then decreeing that Ringo himself must be sacrificed. The 4 band members are assisted by a member of the sect who isn't into the whole sacrifice ideology. The sect's attempts to get at Ringo grow more and more creative and insane, and the Beatles are forced to constantly flee from England to Austria to the Bahamas under the protection of Scotland Yard and The British Army. Mixed in is a mad scientist (Victor Spinetti) who wants the ring for his own mad devices. The movie is a typical early-mid 60's farce, much in the genre of Peter Sellers (no surprise as director Richard Lester directed many of Sellers' movies). The problem, story-wise, is that at times it tries to be a James Bond spoof, at other times it tries to be a spoof of If It's Tuesday, This Must be Belgium and other zany comedies. The movie could not decide which kind of a farce it was to be, and loses the battle when compared to the cohesive, Liverpudlian comedy of A Hard Day's Night. Lastly, the movie is filmed during the height of Beatlemania, when the lads were already tiring of all the pressures and lack of freedom and time. In some cases, you can see they just shot the scenes as a lark and didn't care whether it was perfect or not. Off screen, the Beatles themselves say they were not into the movie (they wanted to do a serious movie, perhaps a Western), and were getting into pot-smoking and were kind of stoned through filming. In spite of all this, the film is actually quite clever and enjoyable and fits in with many of the sillier comic chase films of that era. If one remembers this movie was meant to be silly and not funny and remembers it is a farce, not a creative work of inspired genius, it is very enjoyable and fun to watch, even after 40+ years.

It's been noticed by some Eastern cult headed by Leo McKern and these guys ain't kidding about what it takes to get it. The one who wears the ring has to be a human sacrifice.So when all kinds of strange people start going after our page boy teen idols, it's one merry anarchistic chase all over the United Kingdom and other parts of the globe. Leo McKern and such other British character actors like Alfie Bass, Victor Spinetti, and Patrick Cargill get it on the fun. Eleanor Bron plays a fifth columnist in McKern's camp looks to help the Beatles because she's one of several million fans they have across the globe and she really does like the drummer with the honker.Like it's predecessor Help's soundtrack is still selling in the gazillions because it has several John Lennon-Paul McCartney songs still popular like A Ticket To Ride, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away and the title song.Also like it's predecessor it paved the way for the venue of the music video which today's musical artist seem to prefer more than records on which you can hear them.

A little historical perspective will show that, unlike many entertainers of the day, the Beatles were obviously not too concerned with `selling out' or cashing in on a proven formula nor were they obsessed with the quality of the finished product necessarily. Lennon was later quoted as saying that the `best bits were left on the cutting room floor To suggest, however, that the Beatles were trying to `outdo A Hard Day's Night' is just unadulterated ignorance.  One has to take into account that, in the sixties (especially in the Beatles' entourage), artistic integrity stood for something.  Selling out was frowned upon and just wasn't what the Beatles did.The restored film by The Four Media Company is worth searching out, as it contains the original version of the title song, `Help!,' which differs distinctly from the album, more well-known, version of the song.  This version was originally released with the movie and the single, and was later eliminated from the album soundtrack in favor of a more polished version. In my own humble opinion, the version of the song `Help!' that originally appeared in the film release seems to represent more of how Lennon had intended the song.  He's on record as stating that he always wanted to redo the song.  It's not as upbeat as the album version, but it seems silly now to sing this song upbeat, given the subject matter.

They're still recognized and all by supporting characters, but being left to their own devices, in approximately more ways than one, it's got madcap tattooed on its brain. There's not really a Lord of the Rings element to it, being that the ring isn't going to destroy the entire world or not if it gets destroyed. In a way it's a MacGuffin (even as there is many a line exchanged about the importance of a finger, and how much Ringo might need it or not if chopped off). It could be anything, just as long as it has those quick-witted and quick-footed chaps from Liverpool on the run from the dastardly foreign royal-hunters and the scientists.To describe all of what happens in Help! would take up more than a page load, but to put it really quick some of the highlights- Beatles in the Alps, Beatles in the Bahamas, Beatles in a royal palace, and all going back to the temple! Well, those aren't really highlights, but there's lots of great nuggets of gags and jokes in there. In fact, I'd say that the first half of the film, while the boys are still wondering why the hell they're being chased all around just for the big red rock on Ringo's finger, is purely wonderful, spot-on comedy, where the irreverent goes to very long lengths, including title cards, surprising exchanges, and all in very broad strokes. No need to know what these fellows are really like, that's never a point to be made. They're too busy for that- what with getting tailed every which way, recording songs, playing songs, dancing sometimes randomly when an alarm clock goes off or getting out of places in outrageous break-out-of-window fashion, and then even getting caught in the middle of a military assault. All of it is pulled off via Richard Lesters's direction with a full understanding of how this being silly, and the Beatles going for it, allows for so many possibilities, and almost all of them are realized.The soundtrack, by the way, is definitely a favorite from the early Beatles days, with the classics of the title track, Ticket to Ride, Got to Hide Your Love Away, and Lose that Girl among others. They all fit in very well with the story too, or what's there of it. And the climax, which almost becomes anti in the last couple of minutes, is actually a given considering all that's happened- it caps off a 'why not' attitude to the situations that unfold. Also, quite a few excellent, quotable lines too. It's one of the best pictures of 1965.

It was the second feature film made by the Beatles and is a comedy adventure which sees the group come up against an evil cult. The soundtrack was released as an album entitled Help!.The Beatles again aim for a mix of goofy comedy and sterling pop music. A sacred ruby ring comes into Ringo's possession, attracting the unwelcome attention of an exotic religious cult and forcing the boys to go on the run. This chase narrative is thankfully never taken too seriously, serving mainly as an excuse for colorful excursions to international locations from Europe to the Bahamas.

Like its predecessor, Help! features the band members playing themselves in a fictional story, and was directed by Richard Lester, but this time, instead of exaggerating the band's real lives at the height of Beatlemania, the band was put into a James Bond spoof. This all happened more than twenty years before I was born, but I clearly remember seeing both films in the late nineties, when I was around eleven years old. After watching the first of the two again in 2007 and this year, I finally watched this follow-up again, for the first time in over a decade. It turns out that I still think both efforts are good.A certain Asian cult believes in a goddess named Kaili, and believes in sacrificing people to her. A woman in this cult is about to be sacrificed when it is discovered that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. Beatles drummer Ringo Starr happens to be the one who is currently wearing this ring, so several members of the cult go to London so they can retrieve it! However, all their attempts to get it off of Ringo's finger fail, and the world-famous drummer eventually learns that if he doesn't get the ring off soon, he will be the cult's next sacrifice! Obviously, he now wants to get rid of the ring, but no matter what anybody does, they cannot get it off! It doesn't help when after they get a mad scientist named Foot and his assistant, Algernon to try and remove the ring and the two of them fail, Foot decides he wants it for himself! All this trouble sends the Beatles on a wild adventure, taking them out of England and to different parts of the world, with cult members and the two mad scientists pursuing them! John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr all did a very good job portraying themselves in a comical manner in A Hard Day's Night, and fortunately, they hadn't lost any steam by the time they starred in this follow-up. The quality of this 1965 comedy is definitely helped by their performances, and there are other cast highlights as well, such as Leo McKern as Clang, the cult leader. As the Fab Four make their first appearance in the film, going into their separate sections of their flat as two women on the street watch and talk about them, the humour looks promising, and then there are lots of funny moments as we watch them inside. The film may soon go downhill a little, as the writing and humour sometimes show that they could have been better, but there certainly are more good laughs. There's some good humorous dialogue in Help!, even if it doesn't get as funny here as it does in A Hard Day's Night. This second Beatles film is more about slapstick than the first, but this usually works here. The plot of this movie also impressed me, and the adventure takes the band members to some nice locations, such as the Austrian Alps. Like its predecessor, this film also features a good bunch of Beatles tunes to add to the entertainment.A Hard Day's Night and Help! were apparently both successful back when they were originally released in the 60's, but it appears that today, the former is more popular. Personally, I'm not 100% sure which one I think is better. In my opinion, maybe the 1964 release is just a bit better as a comedy than this follow-up is, but both of them are entertaining for the most part. Also, as a film that parodies James Bond, Help! is much better than certain other films that do the same, including the spoof version of Casino Royale, which was released within the next couple years after this second film starring the Beatles. I haven't seen every single Bond spoof, but of the ones I have seen, some are funny and some not some much, and this one is basically one of the former. I would say it's also better than Thunderball, the Bond film which came out the same year. If you're a Beatles fan and want to hear some of their songs with some wacky humour and adventure to go with them, this 1965 comedy is probably a good movie for you to check out, even if you find that it's inferior to the Fab Four's film debut.

The movie didn't really have much of a plot other than a religious sect was trying to recover a ring from Ringo's finger, using any method and at any cost. There are lots of funny and borderline insane vignettes along the way, interspersed with great songs like the title tune, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, Another Girl, You're Gonna Lose That Girl, I Need You, and others. The action proceeds with little rhyme or reason until the final free-for-all scene on a tropical island beach, where the ring finally is dislodged from Ringo's finger. The film is dedicated to Elias Howe who, in 1846, invented the sewing machine.In 1965, a lot of people believed this film was a huge letdown from 1964's A Hard Day's Night. I think we should agree that the first film was a classic whose success could never be matched. We should also agree that Help! was a completely different film, produced a year later when the Beatles were riding the final wave of Beatlemania and the public's perception of them was much different. Remember, many critics thought the Beatles would never last past the end of 1964; the group proved them wrong again and again. So sit back, watch, and--especially--LISTEN. You'll be delighted.

That belongs to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (and YELLOW SUBMARINE might have the edge on this picture innovation-wise). But there's no denying that The Beatles' charisma carries HELP! to levels other rock musicals can only aspire to.Which is the picture's only detriment. When the Fab Four aren't on screen, HELP! feels a little flat. They're such commanding presences that anyone would suffer by comparison, let alone the fine character actors who populate this comic fantasy.But this is a minor quibble. Try to resist the great songs, every one of which is a gem. Try not to laugh at some of the broader sight gags (like the contents of their shared flat). Try to suppress a smile at director Richard Lester's manic pacing. He is the guy who invented the music video, for better or worse. In effect, HELP! and A HARD DAY'S NIGHT are the blueprints for everything that has come since&#133;and I'm not speaking of musicals, but of all contemporary cinema (its cutting, its pacing, its self-reference).If HELP! seems at all dated, it's only because the gags and techniques have been so endlessly cannibalized by lesser productions. But this is a small price to pay for such sunny hopefulness. In a world where rock seems to epitomize whiny, self-absorption, I wish I could have been around for the real deal.

It is about Ringo, who, before the plot of this film, is sent a ring (perhaps this film should have been called 'Ringo and his Sacrifical Ring') and decides to wear it. Then, quite a few failed attempts are made to get the ring off Ringo's finger (including a scene where the torso of George's shirt is sucked up, revealing a sexy chest and abs -- very nice!). Then they discover The ring was sent to him by a 'lady' who, had she kept the ring on, would have been killed. If Ringo keeps the ring on for too long, that he will be killed. Ringo can't get the ring off his finger, so he leaves it on for, sadly, too long. He and his friends travel around the world (well, the Swiss Alps and the Bahamas)...

His zany '60's comedies redefined a medium slowly sinking in the overweighted direction of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World.  The Knack and How to Get It won him the 1965 Best Picture Academy Award but this film, released the same year, is much funnier.What some reviewers see as a 'thin plot' is really a spoof on the James Bond-inspired thrillers popular at the time.  Lester's masterpiece is far superior to contemporary spoofs such as Casino Royale or Modesty Blaise at least partly because of the brilliant comedic acting talents of the Beatles, whose superb sense of comic timing and deadpan delivery are remarkable, even in comparison to the all-pro cast of Casino Royale.  Lester is likewise able to hold the plot in clearer prospect than any competing thriller-spoof (such as the awkward Barbarella) making the film much easier to follow.The story is relatively un-PC by contemporary standards.  A fan sends Ringo a colorful ring, which is actually used to identify sacrificial victims for a Kali-worshipping cult.  Alerted to the danger the Fab Four attempt to discard the ring, but it has miraculously adhered itself to Ringo's finger.  The killer cult, and an incompetent mad scientist, chase the lads from London to Switzerland to the Bahamas in an endless succession of slapstick and absurdity.

They are followed, however, by an entourage that includes the apparent religious leader of the tribe and his henchmen (who want to sacrifice Ringo), a mysterious woman who wants to save him, and two scientists who are after the ring's great power. This movie was largely dismissed by critics at the time of it's release. The Beatles' first movie, A Hard Day's Night, was acclaimed for it's smart humor and real-life feel. Help, on the other hand, was unfortunately filmed just after the Beatles had discovered pot, and thus they spent more time babbling and giggling than caring about the movie. But, to be fair, the film does give it's audience a good time. Yes, the humor is ridiculous. Yes, the plot is wacky. But-- as long as audiences are willing to not expect too much intellectual stimulation, Help is actually a lot of fun. Plus, some of the scenes are just laugh out loud hilarious. I've also found that while Beatles fans tend to appreciate A Hard Day's Night more, non-Beatle fans seem to like Help better. Also, as a trivia bonus pay close attention to the ending credits. At the very end, the Beatles walk around in a circle, each one coming up to the camera at his turn. In the background, Paul holds a bong, and when he approaches the camera, he blows the smoke out.

For one, The Beatles themselves, particularly John Lennon, were growing audibly weary to any artistic endeavors they couldn't control directly (Walter Shenson and Richard Lester were in charge here). Then there's the fact that Lester's style of direction seems to turn out better in black and white (compare THE KNACK...AND HOW TO GET IT to A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM, if his Beatle flicks don't convince you of that point). The earlier film was closer to what The Beatles' real lives were like (as THE FIRST U.S. VISIT establishes). Then there's filming the second half of the picture in settings chosen on a whim (Switzerland) and for tax purposes (The Bahamas) rather than cinematic necessity. the title song to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is generally celebratory, while that of HELP! is a personal cry from a despondent John Lennon. The original distributor, United Artists, never maintained good prints of the picture after the theatrical run, sending copies with faded colors to local TV stations throughout the '70s (when MPI first issued the movie on home video in '86, they had to colorise it to make it viewable). And the list goes on from there... ...given all of that, HELP! remains one of the few jukebox musicals to actually try something more ambitious than its genre would dictate, and on each level it succeeds. A brilliant comic cast (including Victor Spinetti, Roy Kinnear, Eleanor Bron and Leo McKern) was assembled in support, the comedy sends barbs at the British government as much as it does the entertainment industry, there are brilliantly surreal touches throughout (the bath scene during the intermission is my personal favourite), and the entire exercise is a spoof of the other United Artists gravy train of the period, the James Bond pictures. There's even my all-time favourite gag line, in which Kinnear turns to Lennon and says about Spinetti, He's out to rule the world -- if he can get a government grant...

Unlike Yellow Submarine and A Hard Day's Night, Help! is more a film for Beatles fans than outsiders.It's human-sacrifice time at an Eastern (read Indian) temple, but the ceremony is halted when the angry Clang (Leo McKern) realizes his would-be victim has lost her ceremonial ring. Turns out it's in the possession of a drummer named Ringo (Ringo Starr) who along with his fellow Beatles (John, Paul, and George) is soon being chased from A (Alps) to B (Bahamas) by Clang and his homicidal congregants.Help! was how the Beatles followed up on the surprise success of A Hard Day's Night, with a nod in the direction of that other British property of United Artists, James Bond, as it sends up a stream of glam, globe-trotting silliness. Another major influence here is Bob Dylan. Dylan pushed John Lennon in a more introspective songwriting direction, seen here with the title song and the sublime You've Got To Hide Your Love Away. Less positively for the film, Dylan also introduced the Fab Four to cannabis, their drug of choice throughout the Help! shoot.Lennon called it the band's marijuana-for-breakfast period, and while I don't see any telltale redeyes, the band members do seem curiously disengaged, from the project and each other. Except for one scene where the other three Beatles try to persuade Ringo to lose the ring, even if it also means the finger its stuck on (John Me and Paul haven't seen you make any use of that finger, have we, Paul?), there's not much chemistry on display. Was it just pot, or that other drug called fame that made them so haggard after only a year?They look best when miming a series of terrific songs presented inventively by director Richard Lester. You're Going To Lose That Girl is shot in a studio with eerie light effects shooting through the haze of cigarette smoke. George Harrison's I Need You chugs along nicely as the Beatles perform behind a cordon of tanks. Another Girl has the boys playing in the sand with pretty girls, laying out the blueprint the Monkees would follow a year later on American TV.As a Beatles fan, there's something special also about seeing the band in 1965, a kind of high-water mark of their popularity. Their moptops have sprouted into mushrooms, while Beatlemania itself was mushrooming in popularity (their August 1965 concert at New York's Shea Stadium would be the biggest in their career) and recognition (MBEs meant a real trip to Buckingham Palace, not the fake one seen here).The movie is a trip, in a good way mostly, as long as one doesn't try to follow the ever-vanishing plot line. No, Hard Day's Night didn't have a plot line, either, but it had the Beatles in concrete form. Here, the sharpness of Lennon's performance, and Harrison's banter with the others, is less on. Paul McCartney again brings up the rear in the acting department; perhaps his mind was on that Scrambled Eggs ditty he was working on between takes. Even Ringo seems sluggish, dopey rather than winsome (who can forget that look he gives the seductress in the train car in Hard Day's Night?)It may have been the drugs, it may have been the celebrity, it may have been that they were handed a dodgy script. But something about the Beatles both disappoints and redeems Help! No, the chemistry's not there, but the charisma still is. It reminds me of another thing Lennon said later No matter how wretched things got, something about the four of them and the image they carried pulled them through. Eight Arms To Hold You was this film's working title; it may have been what was holding them, too. "},{"Title":"An Instant Classic! Absolutely Underestimated by Almost Everybody!","Date":"27 September 2006","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Musical","Review":" I really liked reading the resumée of that person who used to watch Help! when he was a kid, because his mother was a Beatles Fan. In our case (my 2 brothers and me) it was similar. But we being German, got to record the movie on VHS back on the day John Lennon got killed.As far as I know this was the only time it was ever broadcast in Germany. This movie immediately became our All-Time-Classic, the one movie we could all lip sync all the way, that one movie that we would re-play when we were on holiday and just recreate scenes that fitted to the then present situation. As for a deep analysis of this movie I'm still too involved ( not really!), now being 37! But all I can say is this To me the movie has certain prophetic aspects in regards of what was to become out of the Beatles. While the music was quite deep and absolutely touching the storyline completely made fun of almost everything in a superb surrealistic way. They were being used as means to make money, as artists they had no control of the visual and story wise outcome. Also, because it was overdubbed with German classic taught theater comedians, the lack of timing and weird, hard to understand comments (especially for non native tongue speakers) by the Beatles themselves were gone. I know that I will get criticized by real movie experts for saying this, but in my view this is the rare case where a movie benefited heavily from being translated into an other language. Because of this the movie also reveals the wacky weird humor of the uptight German years in the sixties. To me it is absolutely sad that this movie is not available on DVD in a proper way. Although there is a DVD, which I own, that seems to be copied of a videodisc the quality of that copy is lousy. Also 43 aspect ratio and NTSC isn't the stuff that is really possible. But at least there's German on there. So if anybody wants to learn German here you go, you won't find a better and funnier way to learn a foreign language! cheers e.

Instead, it was just a boring, unfunny mess. It wasn't the worst movie I had ever seen, and there were some good parts, but half the movie was either hard to follow, or just didn't make sense.

Basically sacrificial ring has gone missing from an Eastern cult, Ringo Starr (as Ringo), drummer of The Beatles, is wearing it after it was sent to him, he assumed it was from a fan. Several cult members, including Clang (Leo McKern), Ahme (Eleanor Bron) and Bhuta (John Bluthal) leave for London, England to find the ring, and eventually find Ringo, and the other band members George Harrison (as George), John Lennon (as John) and Paul McCartney (as Paul). They make several failed attempts to steal the ring, but they eventually confront Ringo in an Indian restaurant, he is freaked to find out that if he does not return the ring, he will become the next sacrifice, but is is stuck on his finger. John, Paul and George try to protect their friend, not just from the cult members, but also from mad scientist Foot (Harry and the Wrinklies' Victor Spinetti) and his assistant Algernon (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Roy Kinnear), and a Scotland Yard Inspector (Patrick Cargill), eventually all The Beatles end up going on the run. In the end The Beatles and all pursuing characters end up on a beach together, Ringo unintentionally throws the ring off his finger, he, George, John and Paul run around for fun while the police rush about arresting some of the characters, Bhuta with the ring on becomes the new target for sacrifice. This film does have a bit more of a storyline than the previous film the band appeared in, compared it is not as exhilarating or fun as it, but there are some relatively amusing moments, and it does have some of their greatest songs, including the title song, Ticket to Ride and I Need You, and an a cappella version of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, this is a fun enough musical comedy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best British Cinematography and Best British Costume. The Beatles were number 4 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Worth watching!

The plot is absolutely surprising, at the beginning we think the story will be about the career of the Beatles, a biopic of them but in fact it is a story totally apart from what we imagine. Yest they are the Beatles and famous as in real life but it is not a biopic.The main character seems to be Ringo, because he is the one who has the ring, the fact that his name is Ringo and that sounds similar to ring seems to be a pun but apparently it is not the reason why is Ringo who has the ring.In the movie, musics has a major place. It gives rhythm to actions and makes them more funny or exciting. In a way, just like a cartoon for kids, where music is based on actions and changes with them.So, not surprisingly, music is very good, as it is the Beatles, so almost everyone will like it. The style of the movie, like the Beatles' house, the places where they go, the clothes of the Eastern cult, all that gives the movie a unique and really interesting style, that I personally really appreciate.

However, it is complicated to define this kind of movie because it is a melting of comedy, science fiction, thriller... The plot focuses on the ring that is impossible to remove from Ringo's finger. In fact, I found the idea surprising and unexpected. However I find some passages confusing and boring, sometimes the film is unpleasant. As regards the script, I think it is strange but funny.

It is difficult for us to give it a genre  it is an absurd and/or burlesque movie, like for example in England a few years ago with the Monty Python (Their influence in the comic field is compared to that of the Beatles in music.); or currently with film directors like Quentin Dupieux. The plot isn't really important here, like Rubber(by Q. Dupieux)  The story of a devil rubber killing people (it is more or less something like that). But here, the lack of a plot is a pretext to show music videos between crazy scenes. We can consider it a Road-Movie, because in fact, it is a road-movie (even if we can not talk about Road- movies before Easy Rider in 1969 by Dennis Hopper, except perhaps for Pierrot le Fou by J-L. Godard in 1965). The famous rock band goes from England to the Alps (Ausrtia) and the Bahamas (in Nassau) because of an Eastern Cult track Ringo to sacrifice him to a goddess but, before killing him, they must paint him red. It is because Ringo is wearing a sacrificial ring that he can't remove. The Fab Four always have to escape to stay alive. then other people will join their quest  police men (Scotland Yard) without any weapons; an Eastern woman who easily fell in love with Paul McCartney; a mad scientist needing a Nobel Prize, etc.Personally, I love that kind of movie and I like this one too because it is a good one after all. It well represents that 'British humor' even if the movie was directed by Richard Lester (American), his touch is perceived with the editing where scenes and video-clips are well linked together; in a way that is not surprising. This is interesting, if we want to extrapolate, Help! reminds me the masterpiece Man with a Movie Camera by Dziga Vertov (in 1929) off course not for the Kino-Pravda!

Thereby, you'll enjoy watching the Beatles being chased from England to the Bahamas, passing by the Alps, by the fanatic members of a mysterious and ridiculous sect, trying to rob Ringo's sacrificial ring. And yet, if until here the storyline doesn't seem to overwhelm logic, the end helps. Because even though logic was somehow maintained through the Fab Four's adventures, even if it swayed a lot, it collapses with the final scene, when every single character, probably guided by a drunk scriptwriter, meets at the beach and tries to obtain what one wants by stabbing whoever one sees. And whatever you may think after you read this, I liked it! Because it was really relaxing to see it. I had a good laugh, thanks to its fantastic British sense of humor.

This may be because the plot resembles not Monty Python but a Goon Show episode. This breakthrough show of the 50s and very early 60s often featured a nemesis called the Red Bladder played by Ray Ellington as well as other Indian characters voiced famously by Peter Sellers in Spike Milligan's surreal story lines in which Milligan also acted. They were often set in far flung corners of the British Empire and mercilessly lampooned the British, It was a fore runner of Monty Python and its spin off Ripping Yarns. Readers may be interested in the Goon Show episode called the Last British Banana Tree where our heros are sent to protect the last bananas. Not only do the bananas get blown up, so do the Goons to the catchphrase You've deaded me. Richard Lester was heavily involved with this comedy partnership and it is my contention he has referred to this default position when organising Beatles film two. The Goons had 20 minutes comedy interrupted by two musical interludes per half hour. Then it stopped. Help! goes on its manic way for an entire feature pausing only to have musical interludes featuring the Beatles. But the problem is this. When we tuned into the Goons we expected the show to be dominated by comedy, when I went to the Gaumont, Liverpool in 1965 we expected to hear Beatles music and so came out of the cinema theatre feeling unsettled and shortchanged. Maybe this intention to slightly unsettle was deliberate on Lester's part. It seemed asif it could be that in Britain that the writing was on the wall for the Beatles as Merseybeat and the Cavern were on the wane in the popularity stakesat this point in time. Could this be that this is why there is no victorious ending to the film. It ends with a dust up on a beach (or should that be sand up)to the title song. The Beatles survive but that is about it. As Lester has just played Help as the film descends into Goon like fiasco, he can hardly repeat the same song for the end credits so he resorts to a shot of the ring with the Beatles imitating the Goons (I kid you not) before THE END title shows. .We could have had another Lennon and McCartney song or John singing Dizzy Miss Lizzy that is o the flip side of the UK Help album. But instead we have something not Beatles related.We get a snatch of classical music. At no time do we see anyone enjoying the Beatles music. Leo McKearn says it is shocking and throws darts at a cinema screen with the Beatles tearing through the opening song Help!. This is despite the music being fabulous. Later the Beatles perform in a recording studio or in a series of remote locations such as Salisbury Plain, icy Scandanavia or on a deserted Caribbean beach. Never to an audience.The Beatles were still a performing band at this stage and only a short while later played Shea Stadium so why not play out with a shot of the Beatles in concert? Granting that the public would have been in danger from the Eastern Cult (according to the plot line)before this we could at least have had a live performance as a climax as in Hard Day's Night, Let It Be or even Magical Mystery Tour, even if it was with the titles superimposed across it. Maybe the symbolism of the end with its camera perspective being viewed through the faces of the red ring-jewel is to hint to us that we have been watching the Beatles through a prism. Rather than the intimacy of A Hard Day's Night we have been kept at a distance from the Fab Four. The first feature felt as if we were with the Beatles. This keeps us at an arm's length from them. Nevertheless what we are left with is a fun,melodic feature, its colourful sheen and frantic plot lines stopping us from realising that. Beatles music apart, there is nothing of much substance going on here. Best viewed by Beatles fans as the one in colour. It has some great innovations that would be used in music videos such as Ticket to ride etc and as a Beatles fan I wouldn't be without it,but... Magical Mystery Tour (or should it be a Day Out in the Life of the Beatles) is more authentically Beatles and has about the same ratio of music in a much shorter film. It continues the great video experiment pioneered by Lester. "},{"Title":"Help! (1965) ***","Date":"29 April 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Musical","Review":" HELP! was the second Beatles movie, and it takes on a completely different direction from their first Rock Classic, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964). This time we have John, Paul, George and Ringo in a bizarre and colorful comedic romp as hapless victims, in danger at every turn, when a murderous eastern cult thirsts for their blood. Or that is to say more specifically, for Ringo's blood ... as he wears a sacred ring that he once received from an Eastern fan, and now the tribe of fanatics need to reclaim it for a sacrifice. The problem is, Ringo cannot get the ring off his finger and becomes the prime target! The Beatles never cared for HELP!, and John Lennon once dismissed the film as crap, saying that the filmmakers forgot who The Beatles were, and that they were like guest stars in their own movie. Be that as it may, and with all due respect to Lennon, this is still a rollicking good time for those willing to get outrageous and not look for deep meaning or expect everything to make much sense. The pursuit takes The Beatles from England to the Swiss Alps and to The Bahamas -- all around the globe, in a zany hodgepodge best describe as a cross between James Bond and the Adam West BATMAN TV show. Leo McKern is a comic delight as the frustrated fat high priest Klang, who keeps getting foiled by our boys. Victor Spinetti is a pure treat as a clueless mad scientist (he's out to rule the word ... if he can get a government grant...) who also becomes intrigued in securing Ringo's mysterious ring. Naturally along the way we get to hear several splendid classic Beatles songs. In addition to the title hit, Help!, there are Ticket To Ride, You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, The Night Before, Another Girl, I Need You, and You're Gonna Lose That Girl. *** out of **** "}{"Title":"The Beatles' Help! is uneven as a comedy but does provide much fine imagery on the music performance side","Date":"17 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Musical","Review":" Since I've seen all the other Beatles movies, I decided to check out Help! from my local library last week. It's quite uneven with the hit-and-miss gags both visual and verbal and the Fab Four don't make it easier to understand them when they seem to just say things that make no sense most of the time. Still, much of the supporting cast seem to have some fun with their roles and the way director Richard Lester films many of The Beatles' song performances-perhaps bringing birth of the music video to fruition with his style-does provide some entertainment that make this tolerable to say the least. Perhaps Ringo comes off best but then he's the central character whose ring is the source of the chases he and his fellow band members go through. In summary, Help! is a nice time capsule of how silly the '60s seemed to be before certain social events made the decade perhaps the most turbulent of the 20th century.

Wasn't it the Holy Grail that had this part in it when the screen got funny colors and the voice over says Intermission.? I'd yell out rip of! if I didn't have so much respect for Monty Python. And maybe the Beatles were high most of the time, but I think it only makes their lines come out more natural. The Beatles don't have to act, they're interesting and funny enough just the way they are. In A Hard Day's Night I got the feeling all four of them were trying just a bit too hard, in Help! they are a lot more relaxed and they're being themselves more than that they're really acting.

This movie is like The Three (or 4) Stooges mixed with James Bond, and obviously many Beatles songs. The plot here is that Ringo has a giant ring on his finger that belongs to an uncivilized tribe that wants to kill him, along with some other people trying to catch the Beatles. One good thing about this are the production values, which are great, making this look and feel like a real epic. The songs, though not all my favorite, are mostly catchy and fun to see the videos for them. The plot is really silly, but most will figure that out 3 minutes in anyways. One problem Help! had that none of the other Beatles' films had was it didn't always keep my attention. It might be because this is not a psychedelic movie, just a lighthearted spy parody.

Unlike the Beatles first film hard days night this film is more of a story rather than a day in the life of the Beatles. Personally i prefer this film to  A hard days night as help is more about what the Beatles were like in personality. The influence of Pythonisms and the goon show is very evident in Help and I think the fact that it is there makes the film 100 times better. Help is all about how Ringo Starr was sent a ring by a fan and it turns out this is a sacrificial ring and whoever wears it must die. This therefore gives the Beatles the chance to go all over the world trying to escape Ringos attempted killers. At the time of this film being made the Beatles were heavily into marijuana and this is very evident as many times you can see one of the fab four looking more stoned than a Rastafarian at a marijuana convention. But don't let this put you off. this film is hilariously funny and is well worth seeing. Beatles fan or not you must see it.

Besides having a really weak script that, at times, bordered on pure nonsense, I understand that a lot of Help!'s problems came directly from The Beatles, themselves.At this early point in their music/movie careers The Fab 4 had just discovered the wonders of marijuana. Since the boys were constantly engulfed in such a thick haze of dope smoke during filming, they couldn't remember their lines and were forever going into convulsions of uncontrollable tittering and giggling.As you can well-imagine, the film crew came close, many times, to blowing their tops when scene after scene was botched by more fits of incessant Beatle laughter and another retake had to be done. Naturally, since this was The Beatles that we're talking about here, the crew kow-towed to every whim of Pop Music's new-found royalty, kept their mouths shut, and continued filming at a literal snail's pace.Help!'s story revolves around Ringo getting a certain ring of special significance stuck on his finger, which sends the ring's owner and his followers chasing after the poor bloke. Moving around from London, to the Swiss Alps, to the Bahamas, John, Paul, and George do what they can to keep their pal from coming to any harm, as everything going on around them gets crazier and more blown out of proportion by the minute.

So, through much of the film, the cult members randomly appear and try a variety of cartoony ways to either kill Ringo or cut off his fingers. In addition, an insane scientist and his minion have decided that they MUST have the ring and also try many cartoon-like ways to kill Ringo or tear off the ring.In the 1960s, The Beatles were a hot, hot commodity. So hot that even though they had no acting ability whatsoever, it didn't bother the movie studio--they would just shoot around this! And, in light of this, you can understand how, according to the IMDb trivia, the Beatles felt like extras in Help!! In other words, through much of the films, the Fab Four perform a variety of nice songs and in the rest of the movie they just seem to stand around and have all the actors act around them! Certainly it's no great artistic masterpiece (though die-hard Beatle fans STILL insist it is!), but there is a quirky weirdness that makes it a film that is difficult to hate because it's filled with so many ludicrous sight gags (some of which actually work). Plus, it's hard to find a soundtrack more enjoyable than the one in this film--as it's packed with hit after hit by the boys (such Ticket to Ride, A Hard Day's Night, You're Gonna Lose That Girl and, of course, Help!. So, if you are looking for a coherent script, decent acting or a chance to see who the Beatles REALLY were, then you probably won't be particularly satisfied. Overall, I'd say that if you were alive when The Beatles were a band, then you'll be more likely to enjoy this. If you are younger, then you're likely to think your parents were nuts for enjoying this sort of goof-ball movie! Final verdict--kind of dumb but likable.Some cute moments to look for when Paul is shrunk, the crowd singing Ode to Joy (and knowing all the words in German), the swimmer and the cult leader winning a ski jumping medal.Also, while I'd NEVER encourage drug use, my assumption is that this would improve your enjoyment of this film tremendously.

Of course nothing ordinary ever seems to happen to them and an experience with a sandwich vending machine is only the first unusual occurrence that makes Ringo suspect things are not what they seem. Indeed he is correct as the flamboyant ring he sports all the time is actually a symbol that he is next to be a living sacrifice in a cultish ritual. Much to the chagrin of the rest of the band though, Ringo is reluctant to be sacrificed or have his finger cut off to remove the ring.I quite enjoyed Hard Day's Night and thus checked out Help even though I had heard the plot was a lot more outlandish and silly. This much is of course true as Help is a silly, globe-trotting affair that is certainly a lot bigger in scale than the tour of Southern England that made up the plot of their previous film. Matching this change in tone is the fact that the film is delivered in rich colour &#150; another factor in making it feel a lot bigger and overblown than the HDN. For me this played against it and risked it coming across as the antics of a vanity project. However what keeps it grounded is the same dry sense of humour that took me pleasantly by surprise the first time round.The material supports this with plenty of comic touches but yet again it is the comic playing of the Beatles themselves that makes it the pleasure it is. Lennon yet again is droll and sarcastic and plays very well while McCartney is solid but not quite as good. Harrison had more to do this time and does good work with his lines. As before though it is Ringo who stands out as the best of the bunch, gleefully underplaying and allowing himself to be the butt of many of the jokes to the greater good. The colourful and hammy support cast suit the erratic and silly plot but it is the Fab Four that keep it grounded in a sarcastic and imaginative sense of humour that very much appealed to me.Overall then, this film is all a bit too silly and erratic to be entertaining as a story but it has other qualities to cover it. The musical numbers are of course one such selling point but, as with the first film, it is the strong comic style of the lead four that makes it enjoyable for me.

While the Beatles were insidiously changing the face of rock 'n roll at this time, their films embraced a much more old-fashioned movie-structure; Help! could be an update of any number of '50s Hollywood teen flicks, and yet it started a trend of its own (followed in quick succession by Herman's Hermits and the TV series The Monkees).

"}{"Title":"A Haze of Marijuana","Date":"18 September 2009","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Musical","Review":" The Beatles' first film, A Hard Day's Night, was made, on a very low budget, in order to cash in on Beatlemania while it was still in its early days. Their second film, Help!, made a year later by the same director, Richard Lester, was more ambitious, being made in colour and involving shooting in exotic foreign locations. Whereas the earlier film was made in a mock-documentary style, Help! is a would-be zany comedy. Influences that have been suggested include the Marx Brothers, The Goons, Bugs Bunny and even James Bond.The plot, such as it is, involves a fictional Indian cult (based upon the Thugs) who practise human sacrifice in honour of the goddess Kali, here for some reason spelt Kaili and pronounced Kylie. (Although Kylie Minogue was not even born in 1965, the idea that an eastern cult might be worshipping the diminutive Australian pop star has a certain surreal appeal for modern audiences). The cult are attempting to recover their sacred sacrificial ring which has come into the hands of Ringo Starr, and pursue the Beatles all over the world in order to achieve this goal. There is also a sub-plot about a mad scientist attempting to obtain the ring in his quest for world domination.Although as individuals the Beatles, especially John Lennon, all appear to have been witty and amusing, there is a big difference between being a wit and being a successful comedian, and an even bigger one between being a wit and being a successful comic actor. On the basis of this film the Beatles were not great comic actors, and there is no reason why they should have been. Those who are highly accomplished in one field are not always equally accomplished in others, and to expect the Beatles to have been a great comedy team is rather like expecting the Pythons to have been a great rock band, or like expecting George Best to have taken on Rod Laver in the Wimbledon final.The film also serves as a reminder (along with the Black and White Minstrel Show and TV comedies like Love Thy Neighbour and Mind Your Language) of just how politically incorrect the British entertainment industry could be in the sixties and seventies. Leo McKern's turn as the head of the cult, the great Swami Clang, makes Peter Sellers' performance in The Millionairess look like a model of cultural sensitivity. Like Sellers, McKern seems to assume that the main characteristic of Indian English (apart from an odd accent) is the tendency to exclaim Oh my goodness! at regular intervals. Although the Thugs were suppressed in the early nineteenth century, this film, together with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, serves to keep alive the utterly mistaken idea that human sacrifice forms part of Hindu ritual. I suspect that if this film had been made a couple of years later, during the Beatles' Transcendental Meditation period, they might have been more respectful about Indian religion.A Hard Day's Night was a mediocre comedy, redeemed by its great music. The comedy in Help! fails even to rise to the level of the mediocre; it is unremittingly feeble and had this film been made by anyone other than the Beatles it would probably be ranked among the worst British comedies of the sixties. (Those comparisons with the Marx Brothers, the Goons and even Monty Python strike me as being very wide of the mark). It does, of course, have some great music, such as Ticket to Ride and the title song, and it was only this that prevented me from switching off my television and going to bed. It is also at times visually inventive; the winter sports scene in the Austrian Alps, to the strains of Ticket to Ride, seems to anticipate the modern pop video. Nevertheless, the film has fewer great songs than its predecessor and contains some of the group's lesser-known items. (Much as I admire the Beatles I have never subscribed to the fundamentalist position that every song they ever performed was a deathless masterpiece). Although its appearance coincided with the album also entitled Help!, not all the songs on that album are heard in the film. One of those omitted is Yesterday, one of the finest songs Paul McCartney ever wrote. Doubtless its reflective, melancholy tone did not fit in with that of the movie.The Beatles themselves did not like this film very much, and John Lennon said they felt like extras in their own movie because they did not have the same control over it as they had had over A Hard Day's Night. They later said that it was shot in a haze of marijuana, and the drug seems to have affected not only the performers but also the director and scriptwriters. 5/10 (mostly for the music).

Some of the gags are fun, David Watkin's cinematography is highly evocative (especially when the cast converges, for no good reason, on an Alpine slope), and the film contains some of the Beatles' best songs.

Where's that famous pluck?","Date":"3 February 2008","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Musical","Review":" How could this film have possibly gone so far astray? Featuring the Beatles, and directed by Richard Lester, 'Help! (1965)' is a spectacular disappointment, a comedy whose only saving grace is a catchy Beatles soundtrack, the only avenue where the band could hardly go wrong. Their previous picture, 'A Hard Day's Night (1964),' also directed by Lester, was such excellent entertainment because it depicted a typical day in the life of the Beatles. They didn't really do anything overly exciting, but, because they're the Beatles, they didn't particularly need to. Alun Owen's screenplay was overflowing with wit, and, in the band members' interactions with fans, reporters and each other, there was plenty of intelligent enjoyment to be had. In 'Help!,' there are occasional flashes of this brilliance, but, whenever the Beatles start being themselves, they are suddenly disrupted by a band of stereotypical slapstick villains, who aren't very interesting at all. The film descends into a poor James Bond parody, a selection of clumsy episodes strung together by a flimsy and unsatisfying spy story.Nevertheless, I will go as far as to say that Lester's film is still worth watching, if only for the excellent soundtrack, in which the Beatles perform a variety of their tracks, some that I'd heard before Help!, Ticket to Ride and other with which I was completely unfamiliar You're Going to Lose That Girl, The Night Before, She's A Woman. Just as in 'A Hard Day's Night,' the director's talent is highlighted in the impressive musical sequences, employing a style that would later influence the filming of music videos. Lester shoots the band's performances using quick cuts, zooms and varying focuses, developing an invigorating sense of timing that complements the soundtrack. Unfortunately, despite a new song cropping up on a regular basis, the narrative padding between these performances is sorely disappointing, as I have already explained. Interestingly, the inclusion of the title song was a last minute decision by the filmmakers, who were unhappy with the working title, Eight Arms to Hold You.When they're not singing, the band members do an adequate job with the material they've been given, but Charles Wood's screenplay is neither intelligent nor interesting enough to really hold our attention. The story, which involves Ringo and his co-stars being tenaciously pursued by a religious cult over his possession of a valuable sacrificial ring, is even sillier than it sounds on paper, so perhaps this particular project was doomed from the beginning. After all, if you're going to watch a movie about the Beatles &#150; arguably the most successful musical act in modern history &#150; you really want to get an inkling of what it was like being a Beatle, especially considering the complete lack of comparison that exists in today's music world. 'A Hard Day's Night' was a wonderful document of this kind, with Paul, John, Ringo and George each playing a likable and recognisable version of themselves, and we get to appreciate the depth of the Beatles phenomenon, from the clamouring journalists to the hordes of screaming teenage fans. 'Help!,' in comparison, is little more than awkward, silly entertainment, which, I suppose, is all right if you like that sort of thing. It's a telling sign that the Beatles themselves were dissatisfied with the project, once remarking that they felt like extras in their own movie.

The plot for what it's worth is a bad James Bond imitation and should not really be seen as anything more than a contractual obligation.

At first, at least.The positive effect, however, wears off after about a half-hour. It's from this point onwards that the movie starts getting slightly tedious. There is only so much mindless farce you can take in one sitting. Richard Lester puts nearly all the comedic emphasis on childish slapstick farce which can be enjoyed for 90 minutes (an eternity, in farcial space-time) only by viewers younger than 12 and adults who think that Carry On is the height of comedic brilliance. Lester's comedies were never subtle, unfortunately, though visually always interesting. Too much goofiness, not enough clever gags. This is lowest-common-denominator humour, unfortunately, with a few rare exceptions.It's ironic that the script has the Beatles getting chased around by a mad Indian religious cult, only a few years before the group actually got suck(er)ed into all that trendy Eastern spirituality malarkey, when they headed to India, dressed in full clown uniform, very self-important, to learn about the ways of the Force. I.e. just a few years before John Lennon's head started inflating to the size of a whale's butt, his Ego spiraling out of all control, when the band embarrassed themselves so royally by expressing publicly their admiration and support for some heavy-set bearded con-artist (whose name I forgot). You know, one of those meditating Indian wonders who attract gullible, young Westerners like flies to crap. There is always money to be made out of rich Westerners who get easily bored - and then seek out abracadabra as a way of making the boredom go away.This relaxed-and-fairly-amiable John Lennon featured in H! existed mere years before the pretentious-hippie Lennon came to life, the same self-righteous and pompous Lennon who tried to educate the world about pretty much everything from sex to politics, with his faithful-yet-dominant charlatan pseudo-artist wife Yoko at his side, following him every step of the way like some deluded witch who couldn't believe her luck. What an amazing couple; ripe for satire and parody from day 1.H! benefits greatly from having the Beatles as their subject matter. If these were the Monkeyz the film would have been pretty much unwatchable. Ditto the Stones. But then I forget that the Stones were already too toffy-nosed to participate in anything as silly as a slapstick comedy. They were serious artists, rebels. Well, not real rebels, just a bunch of middle-class art-school kids who impersonated rebels - and rather successfully, judging from how many people fell for it (as they did for the whole Far East divinity hooey).The soundtrack features some great songs, some solid songs, and one forgettable track. Typically enough, that one crap song was not written by Lennon/McCartney but by George Harrison. But even a crap Beatles song is better than the best most others were/are able to offer.

It's chocked full of continuity slip-ups and the ignorance of the Indian culture that was displayed throughout the film was dreadful.Here's what frustrated me the most. The Beatles were recently introduced to the wonders of marijuana and so instead of using it wisely during their free time; they smoked it 24/7 like there was no tomorrow. They were stoned for nearly every shot. Every shot had to be done multiple times because when one of them went to say their lines they would start giggling.A hell of a lot of pot was being smoked while we were making the film.
