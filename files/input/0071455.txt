It stars Charlton Heston, George Kennedy, Ava Gardner, Genevi√®ve Bujold, Lorne Greene, Richard Roundtree & Marjoe Gortner. A catastrophic earthquake hits Southern California and begins to level Los Angeles......It's not a negative to have heart in the disaster genre of filmTake yourself to 1974, are you there? Good, now maybe you can appreciate this film a little more? Maybe? Earthquake does suffer from old age, it's a statement we see and hear a lot, but it's a fact that some film's stand the test of time whilst others do not. In this desensitised computer age, it is easy to forget that not all the tools available in film making today were available back when film's like this were being made. So as is my want, I firmly judge this as a 1974 offering, to which it delivers enough entertainment to fully satisfy my genre leanings and entertainment persuasions.The main complaint of many is the long build up of the characters, cries of boring can be read across internet forums and critics blogs. I just don't see it that way, yes we want the quake and the mayhem destruction that will follow it; because really this is a disaster film after all, but is it so bad that the film has heart to go with the crash bang wallop? After the build up of characters, where relationships and character traits are formed, the disaster strikes; and it doesn't disappoint, utter destruction as effects and noise fill the eyes and ears, those with a good home cinema system finding it literally does rock the house. We are then treated to a series of sequences that hold and engage our attention, upsetting passages of human sadness, punctured by heroic surges as Heston and the fabulous Kennedy set about saving life, hell! saving the town even. Then it's the film's fitting finale, where there are no cop outs, the makers choosing to go out with a darker edge than its detractors give credit for.Some can scoff at a blood splat effect, or rant about some of the acting on show, but Earthquake achieves two important things. One is that it entertains as a visual experience, the other is that it doesn't soft soap the devastating effects of an earthquake. As the camera pulls away from a ravaged L.A. the impact is sombre, reflection is needed and surely got. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Not really that bad","Date":"23 March 2001","Score":"22 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Earthquake almost realistically shows us the devastating effects of such an event on a large modern day city. Since movie studios didn't have the resources in 1974 to add expensive computerized effects, miniatures, camera trickery and a few large-scale destructions were used to simulate the quake. However even by today's standards, most (but not all) effects work pretty well. Many of the buildings we see crumbling to the ground are actual locals in Los Angeles and anyone who ever lived is this area (myself included) would still find watching this film chilling to say the least. The sets are very impressive - they made one helluva mess of Universal Studios making this film. The acting is so-so and the ending is disappointing and leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions what ever happened to Miles and Rosa's brother anyway? And the scenes with Jody the weirdo are just plain uncomfortable. But as far as pure end of the world disaster entertainment goes, this film has it all.

Lew Slade in the last reel of the film Earthquake. The earthquake(s) in this film are not so much metaphysical, as they might appear to be, but rather in the mind of the average human being in society as we know it today. The human mind is a fragile, and intricate creation, and we as a society must do our best to bring the human living standards to punctilious means.L.A. A high place for society and people of all types, and a place for the danger! The story begins with a high profile roster, starting with Stuart Graff(Charlton Heston) who is a top-of-the-food-chain executive in engineering and constructing monstrosities in Los Angeles. He is in a desolate marriage to Remy Royce- Graff(Ava Gardner.) He is carrying a friendship-and nothing more-with beautiful actress Denise Marshall(Genevieve Bujold), who lives near Sgt. Lew Slade(George Kennedy) who is being hassled by work and former charges Miles Quade(Richard Roundtree) and Sal Amici(Gabriel Dell) and his sister, Rosa(Victoria Principal.) All people are living frivolous, and in some ways, inspiring lives, of daredevil antics and blithe lifestyles. Then, as the title so perceptively puts it, an earthquake hits L.A. causing reckless mayhem to the buildings and petrifying danger to city inhabitants. But the story doesn't stop there. There are many quakes, and plenty of danger to go around, and that is where the story takes flight. The focus of this film is not the quake itself, but how it affects the people of L.A. The film, being extremely Hollywood driven(note the all-star cast; menacing sensurround effect) might appear to be presented as a top of the league disaster film of the trend which was popular at the time, and special effects driven, and it might have been, but there are also many artistic qualities to be found here. One has to examine it first. The scariest thing about this film is that it is plausible, though not probable. The other disaster films at the time were all man made disasters(boats upside-downing; Fire spreading through out a sky- scraper) but Earthquake was the first disaster film to show a disaster that might actually happen, and present characters that people can relate to, in such a treacherous situation. These are real people, and most of them are affected in ways beyond psychological apprehension. But director Robson still manages to make it a fun and enjoyable film without making the situations seem too grim.The characters could all be discussed in a psychology class, to be analyzed even, as each one has his/her own story to tell. However, one of the main characters, the quake itself gets credit too. As there are two jolts, the big quake, and then an unexpected aftershock to boot, there is more than enough rumble to go around. The rumble though, is lasting through out the characters minds, as each one goes a little crazy after the shake, be it irrational, or rational, as there are many different types of people in society. There is parallel destruction going on as well. As the city is torn apart, so are these people and the way they view life, as one character loses it and blows away some fellow roommates who have mistreated him, while others are healed, as a Sgt. who is a drunk and louse, who shapes up and becomes really responsible after the quake. These specifications may or may not be apprehensive to the average audience, and true, opinion is opinion, but Earthquake is a good film that demonstrates how we as a society have allowed for far too long the deterioration of our world and all that affects it. This world is not a toy, it needs to be taken care of, and when we as a society are mean to it(and each other for that matter) mother nature strikes back at us.Be it a big Hollywood Blockbuster, or social commentary, which ever you choose, this film is a great, and overlooked gem in Hollywood history, and an interesting one to read up on(the special effects were outstanding and won a well deserved Oscar) and study in film classes. Great performances by all as well. Mario Puzo wrote the precursor to the Superman earthquake with this one, and Mark Robson has a guilty pleasure tone to his directing. Great fun.

A cast that includes Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, Lorne Greene, Genevieve Bujold, George Kennedy, and Victoria Principal, head this great story of Los Angeles and the lives that are affected by those who live their after a tremor registers at 7,1! The lives and lifestyles of these people, some pleasant, and some not, are put to the test as they are forced to deal with the cause and effect of having a thriving city on tectonic plates, that are rapidly moving. A gem of a film, ridiculed to no end because of varying opinions that should not matter to one of those inquiring minds! Ugh! And they say smoking is bad for you. People need to open their minds, and see. See that this film is not half as bad as most say it is. True, this film is a big Hollywood monopoly fest, and their are no unknowns to be seen, as you have Charlton Heston(Ben-Hur); Ava Gardner(MGM actress); Genevieve Bujold(Anne of a Thousand Days); among others, and even co-stars as Richard Roundtree(Shaft) and Victoria Principal(Dallas.) The cast works really well together, and the print shines.There are a lot of facts explored here, such as animals crying out or running away moments before the quakes, that really give chills out of the reality of it. These are the really great things that happen, and give excitement, not artificial scares made up for the ongoing monopoly that this film has such a reputation for, but rather realistic knowledge that shows what might happen would such a quake strike the earth at such force. Also of note are the scenes with the dam, and the water rising after each pre-shock while a man falls out of an elevator full of water, drowned from it. Great sets as well. Many sets are being torn apart in the quake scenes, while maintaining the reality of sets the tone. The effects, which won a very deserved Oscar, are what really opens the audience's eyes. We see the valley, we see Capital Records, we see Wilshire, and even Zsa Zsa Gabor's bushes get totally eschewed during the disaster. What is really amazing, is that such matting and blue screen was put to use, that to this day, I still scratch my head on how it was all done. It would really be nice to see a featurette on how they did it all. Those scenes, in which there is an after shock, show millions of people running from a huge building that is literally falling to pieces before our very eyes! Amazing stuff. There is truly beauty in this film when looked for. An event... as the tagline reads is right. Every one knows earthquakes cause damage, but how much damage is seen? It was amazing to see Los Angeles fall to pieces, and show the rest of the world what it would be like were a 7.1 ricter scale.Equally great is the Mario Puzo script. The first thing that drew me to this film was how well it pulls the audience into the drama between the characters. Think, in recent films, Magnolia meets Volcano. The relationship between Heston and Gardner, while, can be laughable due to the nature of two divas facing off, is still capable of being appreciated. George Kennedy as a worn out cop plays strictly for drama, and even though he is inter cut with Walter Matthau as a sleazy barman cameo, he gets some seriousness for himself in the end. The structure of the film, from the setting up of the characters some fun(like Principal as Rosa Amici with her friend Roundtree as a daredevil) or characters that you can relate to(Bujold is great as aspiring actress.) As for the development of the disaster itself, the way the tremors start as small, and then the big shake, and then the after shock, builds really well, and the characters, with their emotional baggage and structured emotions deep, intertwine and create a great story that is fun for all.Sensurround was a fast growing mechanism used in films and was fully extent in this one. Many people see this technique as the only reason this film was made, and yes, this was a big Hollywood picture made for monopoly purposes, but there was art in it from the artists who those big wigs hired.There is a really good film here, and it still stands to this day. Great score by John Williams and there is a website you can go to to further understand the film as it is. In the end, even though the reviews have not given this film the justice it deserved, the loyal filmmakers that appreciate art and the joy of dedication and film-making have kept this film where it belongs, with the reputation it deserves.

At the time I didn't question the suitability of the lead stars as I had grown up with them appearing in other films. Considering all the various genre of films I had seen up to that time, I must confess that it didn't seem a bad effort at that point in time. I grew up with various westerns and others and one film in particular I remember well is the classic King Kong.Critics who knock this film must remember that 1974 was a transitional period where techniques were still being learned. Without the benefit of computers, I might add. When you have grown up with computer wizardry, that is, since the start of the seventies, it it far easier to find fault than to see the merit in what these people achieved.However, with the passage of time, one realizes the major fault with this film was the poor casting. This should not detract from the efforts of the special effects people. They have led the way and shown the young people coming along what can be done with skill and imagination. 3/10 for casting, 6/10 for special effects.

How this movie misses it!  It was the best thing it had going for it when it was released in special theaters with sound equipment designed to vibrate your fanny as it sat snugly in those theater seats.   Unfortunately, without the vibrations, Earthquake just ain't as much fun.As disaster films go, Earthquake is certainly not the worst, but is far from the best.  Charlton Heston, fresh from having saved a 747 from certain disaster in Airport 1975, now does his best to save the city of Los Angeles. To be fair though, we knew he wasn't going to stop the earthquake, leaving that for Christopher Reeve in Superman some years later.  But we just knew that as Construction Engineer, Stewart Graff he'd do his best to save a lot of L.A. citizens stuck in precarious situations.  Why else would he be here? And just for fun, he even brought George Kennedy over from Airport 1975 with him although he's a cop named Lew Slade now instead of tinkering around with jetliners.  What a treat!It seems that Lew Slade was chasing a bad guy who had been drunk driving and run down a kid.  Unfortunately the bad guy crashes his vehicle right on the property of Zsa Zsa Gabor, which is out of Slade's jurisdiction.  When another officer who is in the proper jurisdiction berates Slade for messing up Miss Gabor's shrubbery, Slade let's the young officer know how much he cares about plant life by landing a right cross.  This lands him a suspension, and supposedly helps us get to know his character a little better while we pat our foot waiting for the big rumble to start. Did you really think they were going to open a disaster film with the actual disaster?  There's a code in the screenwriter's handbook that says that's not allowed.  At least that's what I'm told.Meanwhile somewhere else in L.A., Stuart Graff is married to Remy Royce-Graff(Ava Gardner) who was fathered by Sam Royce(Lorne Greene) when he was seven I think.  Sam is also Stuart's Boss.  Stuart is having an affair with Denise Marshall(Genevieve Bujold) who happens to be the widow of a former co-worker of Stuart.  We are not told whether Stuart had anything to do with the death of Denise's husband so he could put the moves on her but they could have added that to the plot too.  Generally in these types of films they throw everything in but the kitchen sink anyway so why not?Then on the other side of town we have motorcycle daredevil Miles Quade(Richard Roundtree) along with partner Sal Amici(Gabriel Dell) getting ready to put on the show of his life.  His sister is Rosa Amici(Victoria Principal, before Dallas)who has about the funkiest curly hairdo I think I've ever seen on film.  Think Shirley Temple with coal black hair.  Then there's supermarket manager, weekend warrior, Jody(Marjoe Gortner)who happens to be a fanatic about women with curly coal black naturally curly hair as you'll soon discover.  Now all this might sound interesting on paper, and might make a good soap-opera. In this film it's all useless information since this is a film about an earthquake and after it hits we could care less about what happens up to that point.  Think of it as the filler before the thriller.Even without the oscillating seats, the earthquake itself is still fun to watch.  We get skyscrapers crashing to the ground, buildings falling on people, shards of glass piercing the good citizen's skins, people scalded by stoves, houses explode, freeways cave in, Stuart, Remy, and Sam get trapped in a high rise, a bar comes crashing down around Lew, Miles big motorcycle stunt comes crashing down, Rosa loses her popcorn in a movie theater, Denise's son takes a dive on his bike, and good boy Jody gets to put his uniform on and show us just how psychotic and messed up he really is. This is cool stuff folks even for 1974 type special effects.  Unfortunately, the Earthquake momentarily subsides and we are left to deal with some of the silly plotting the film started out with.  Guess you can't have everything.If you can overlook the usual silliness and terrible dialog which seems to go with the territory in disaster films, you might be entertained by some close calls and daring rescues after the earthquake.  You'll certainly get a few laughs out of Marjoe Gortner's cracked-up soldier performance.  George Kennedy is pretty darn good as the cop.  Heston is better than he was in that Airport thingy, and though his romance with Bujold is an obvious mismatch, it doesn't come near to equaling the absurdity of his relationship with Karen Black on that 747.  Ava Gardner plays the bitchy Remy as if she were competing for the Shrew Olympics.  Lorne Greene looks as if he wishes he was back on the Ponderosa with Hoss, Adam and Little Joe.  Richard Roundtree is fun as the daredevil, but we see little of him after the earthquake.  Tiger Williams as Denise's son Corry spends most of the film unconscious and we are grateful for that.  Usually the kids in disaster films are scripted to be overly cute and annoying.  I think there's a rule in the screenwriter's disaster film handbook about that too.If I have one suggestion to make it would be avoid the version of this film with the added TV footage at all costs.  For those of you familiar with Welcome Back Kotter, if you see any footage of  Rosalie 'Hotzie' Totzie(Debralee Scott)riding an airplane, change the channel, remove the tape, just do what you have to do.  Why this goofy footage was ever added is beyond me.In it's original form my grade for Mark Robson wiping out L.A. C- Hotzie Totzie gets an F and it's back to the sweat hogs for her.

The elements are all there the large, all-star cast, the pathos, the massive devastation, the many intertwined subplots, the Wagnerian heroes and the ultimate banality. For those who find nothing to enjoy in soap operas, trashy romance novels, or depictions of mass destruction on the scale of a `Gojira' film, there is nothing here. But for the rest of us&#133;pure artistry.`Earthquake' was the `Independence Day' of its time. I remember kids talking about how thrilling it was to be `allowed' to see this very frightening PG film (I was very young when it first was released). I remember the hype about `Sensurround' and the sensations that this new sound system was meant to induce. The 70's were an age of Disaster films, perhaps a Return of the Repressed fears that decades of the Cold War had inspired. Certainly the scale of destruction depicted in `Earthquake' is of an apocalyptic scale. Larger quakes have since hit the West Coast several times, and it is now difficult to believe that anyone ever thought a 7.0 quake could devastate LA so completely. What is shown is not the real effects of a massive quake, but the Hand of God reaching down and destroying the impure &#150; and testing the strong.Our heroes are heroic on a grand scale, and Charlton Heston is king of the heroes in `Earthquake.' Again and again he sacrifices and risks himself to help or rescue others, but he is not alone in his altruism. Lorne Greene, George Kennedy (and what is a disaster movie without George Kennedy?) and Fred Williamson all do their part, some sacrificing their lives for others in the process. Unfortunately, `Earthquake' suffers from a lack of interesting villains for these heroes to offset themselves against (aside, of course, from relentless Nature herself), although Marjoe Gortner's nasally National Guardsman does give George Kennedy a chance to note that `Earthquakes bring out the worst in some people.' Those who have celebrated the everyday selflessness of rescue workers in the 9/11 tragedy will find the depictions of lazy and selfish rescuers a bit surprising here, although, again, this was a comment on perceptions of the times. The 1970's was a time of renewed selfishness in American culture, with former Hippies turning away from love and LSD, and towards profit and cocaine. By the 1980's, Americans had become comfortable with the new `Me Generation,' but there was still lingering guilt to work out when `Earthquake' was released. Perhaps this is why Charlton Heston, portraying a successful engineer, must repudiate his trade, saying `I'm ashamed of my profession,' and why businessmen and CEOs must die in their towers of glass and steel. Secretaries, suspended cops and unsuccessful actresses are saved, and the meek inherit the Earth.

At this time, most are probably seeing Earthquake on AMC. This is a bloated version that one of the networks (NBC?) cobbled together in the mid-70s when it first showed Earthquake on TV. My recollection (from almost 30 years ago, mind you) is that the network added a lot of poorly-done footage, specifically the entire subplot with the interminable scenes of the newlywed couple on the airplane!. It wanted to broadcast the movie as a big, two-night ratings extravaganza, but messed it up by adding airplane! scenes that were boring, cheap and cheesy. Not that the movie is all that great in any version, but in its original form it was tighter and had better production values.Watching the AMC (NBC?) version recently, I am reminded that the network did a horrible editing job. Early on, the airplane! is passing over a smoggy and uninspiring Grand Canyon, en route to LA, with an ETA of, what, 45 or 50 minutes? Cut back to the original LA scenes, where Charlton Heston goes through enough experiences involving his career and love life to occupy several ordinary days, and is leaving the office when the earthquake starts. Sometime later, we cut back to the airplane!, which is just landing in LA at this point. The airplane! scenes look as though they were filmed for about $500, with talent that should have stuck with doing deodorant ads. The rest of the movie isn't too bad, although as '70s disaster movies go, I much prefer The Poseidon Adventure.

Chuck's got his shades though, so he's ready for anything. Elsewhere, put-upon cop Kennedy is having a bad day because he's mown down Zsa Zsa Gabor's hedge, and a pre-Dallas Principal has the unfortunate crosses to bear of a 2-storey afro (the only structure undisturbed by the quake) and the unwanted attentions of crackpot SAS commander Gortner.Par for the genre's course, death-defying rescues amidst the sawdust and tinsel is very much the order of the day, but here connected by much bizarrely incongruous throwaway padding involving everyone castwise from Kennedy downwards. There are faint intimations that this could be self-reflexive parody, but given that facetious rock bottom is hit with an unintelligible Walter Matthau's cameo as an inebriated barfly (who's decision to go incommunicado under his real Panavision-necessitating surname must surely have come about after seeing the finished product), I very much doubt it.Save for Kennedy's derisory aside Earthquakes bring out the worst in people, the film has absolutely nothing to say about the psychology of societal collapse; or why, post 9/11, we continue to enjoy watching tall things falling down with people still in them. But any movie in which a pantomime Gardner's first line is Goddammit! can't be a total lost cause. And after her and Chuck's opening domestic tussle, which would come pretty close to John Waters, had he yet gained mainstream acceptance and managed to persuade Liz Taylor to star for him - Of course i'll induce vomiting, I know the rules by now! - the film finally delivers 2 hours of not-so-solid (like it's 40-storey monstrosities) entertainment value. Even if after all is said and done with the laugh-a-minute dialogue, the Incredible Upside Down Cows, the cartoon blood in the liftshaft, Gardner playing Lorne Greene's DAUGHTER which meant he would have had her at 7 years old etc etc etc, the movie ends up nothing but its own 'Airplane!'.Sole aesthetic virtue is its naturalistic sound editing (which understandably won that year's Oscar) and subterranean bass pitch which, combined with the short-lived cinematic 'wonder' of Sensurround - ie earthquake-simulating theaters - meant that certain moviegoers got to join in the vicarious fun of mass panic and devastation.If like me, you like this film for precisely the wrong reasons, you will want to seek out its Japanese rival 'Jishin Retto' (1980) for no doubt 'hours' of endlessly fascinating film-studyish comparison...

I heard negative things about the latter one, and the scores on IMDb indicate likewise. When I by chance found a DVD-copy of this film in a bargain bin for a very low price, I reasoned that the price was affordable enough given its bad repute. Therefore, I was surprised to be quite bitten by the movie almost instantly after the initial credits were rolling. In terms of production values, I judge Earthquake at least as professional and detailed as Towering inferno, if not even more realistic. Those who actually live in L.A. perhaps now how they faked the geography, etc, but the film does manage to draw the spectator in the scenery and create a certain realistic presence. The effects of the Towering Inferno were actually cheesier, this goes especially for the skyscrapers scenes, which are definitely more convincing here than in Towering. Maybe the extras used for the hospital scenes are a bit too rehearsed for the next surpise after shelve, but this is also the case in most other disaster flicks.Plot wise then, and in narration, it has perhaps some shortcomings, there is not a definite apocalyptic climax, and the end may to certain spectators appear to be somewhat sudden, although I actually felt that it offered some moral logic. Because, as is the case for all true big Hollywood disaster flicks from the era, the story is actually a pretext for supplying old-fashioned morality lessons in an era that had already ceded to sins and secularity. All sinners get theirs here, but I noted that the film spares no-one, the extremist weapons fetishist as well as the middle class adulterer will meet their horrific destiny. One may almost call this cynicism, because the inner moral voice of this film does not appear to have taken a rightist or leftist side. It is rather resigned and world-weary. Once again an interesting comparison to Towering can be made, since Towering on the surface takes on a more middle-class leftist approach, where Paul Newman as center of moral gravity, the angry and aware intellectual. Here, the corresponding character is perhaps George Kennedy's antihero, the tired copper who does not carry moral cookies in his pockets, but on the other hand acts humanly to those in need. The same moody resignation you will find in the way the marriage between Ava and Charlton is presented, a sad failure, they don't hate it each other, he just cannot find any ounce of feeling for his alcoholic, middle aged wife. So, when it comes to characterization, I would definitely give Earthquake a higher score than both Towering and Airport, which are dominated by more shallowly drawn characters.Speaking about score finally, the lovers of John Williams will be satisfied; his strings are used effectively here. As always, I have many more things to say, requiring many thousands of words more, but I stop here to not get tedious.

And the film is appropriately somber (not like the silly up-beat disaster films they make nowadays).  Forget Armageddon and Volcano... this is a REAL disaster flick!All that and a very young Victoria Principal!

True, at times, the dialogue is inane, and the many characters can be a little taxing, but the suspense that builds up to the massive earthquake that levels Los Angeles makes for an entertaining film!With an all-star cast from film and television at the helm, the true star (much like the fire in The Towering Inferno, as Paul Newman put it), are the special effects.  For those of us in Los Angeles who are familiar with the freeway overpasses, the malls, and downtown Hollywood depicted in the film, witnessing their destruction delivers an eerie punch that non-Angelenos can't truly appreciate (and, in fact, when the film is broadcast over local television stations after a quake of a significant magnitude in the Los Angeles area, the teaser commercials frequently read  We all felt it... now let's see if Hollywood got it right...)

Worse, it could rumble at only one tone and loudness -- it was either on or off. Even though I was a kid, I wondered why the Sensurround speakers couldn't make us feel the difference between the little warning earthquake, the Big One, and the aftershocks. The only difference between the quakes was how long they lasted. What does it say about the movie when kids in the audience are thinking about the deficiencies of the movie's big gimmick, rather than caring about what was happening in the movie?On the small screen, without even the gimmick attraction of the flawed Sensurround, I can't imagine this movie being entertaining, except as an object of audience mockery.

The earthquake action is as much as can be expected with shaking cameras, miniatures, falling styrofoam and other stuntwork. This is good special effects for its times and satisfies the need for destruction. It's nowhere near as visually compelling as CGI but it feeds the same animal instincts.

It all started with the surprisingly Best Picture nominated Airport that set up the pattern of a series of movies where natural elements terrified an audience hungry for new sensations. As if watching characters drowning in The Poseidon Adventure, burning alive of jumping out of buildings in Towering Inferno or getting tons of concrete on their heads in Earthquake exorcised people's inner fears by turning them into a form of sadistic escapism and entertainment.Or maybe this is too much thinking of Hollywood and it's fair to assume that through the success of the disaster sub-genre, just like the vigilante movies, they have literally struck the Mother Lode, then a film about the 'Big One' was inevitable. This is not meant to diminish at all the value of such premise; after all, The Towering Inferno did exactly the same thing and met with the same fate than Airport, being nominated for Best Picture along with Chinatown and The Godfather Part II. But Earthquake doesn't play on the same league at all. The 1990 version was thousand miles better and more spectacular, 16 years later maybe but it was made for TV!The main difference between Inferno and Earthquake, released the same year, lies on their psychological approach. While Inferno exploits the natural fear of fire and pushes it to the most extreme situations, in Earthquake, the characters mostly deal with the aftermath, getting out a bridge, descending a building literally cut in two, digging a tunnel and even deal with those who 'snapped' and revealed the darkest side of their nature after enlisting in the National Reserve. So apart from a spectacular 10-minute sequence where most of Los Angeles is destroyed, the rest of the film could as well be set in dystopia.But the earthquake part is overall satisfying, buildings and bridges collapse, people are buried alive under rock or earth, glasses get shattered, electricity and water become redoubtable killers, elevators are lethal traps where either you die suffocating, drowning or in pieces &#x85; the film doesn't spare its imagination, and you got it for your money. The special effects vary from extremely convincing to disastrously laughable -I guess if I mention the two words blood and elevator- you'd get it. But in these times were CGI were not even in its infancy, I concede that the images must have been quite a kill for the 70's.The problem with the film is that it doesn't try to dig deeper in the many possibilities it offers. Fear must be the very ingredient of disastrous films, and you can get more thrills for moments of pure expectations. Apart from a few tremors that take you in a mild surprise, Earthquake doesn't capture that horrific vibe that you get when you have the feeling that earth is shaking, something most viewers can relate to. At the end, it's just an exercise in grandiose filmmaking and mass destruction that doesn't leave much to root our imagination and basic feelings into. Our eyes are hooked, but there is something in the story that leaves both heart and mind in a state of unfulfilled hunger. And maybe characterization is to blame.The irony is that despite its A-casting, the film doesn't get rid of its B-movie feel. Charlton Heston is an engineer married to Ava Gardner, she's like a fifty-something version of Martha from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, although she looks much older and makes her casting as the daughter of a 6O-year old Lorne Greene comical if it wasn't so ridiculous. But Gardner wasn't the most miscast character, believe it or not, she did bring the most reliable emotions in the film, the rest of the cast includes Genevieve Bujold as Heston's mistress, the widow of a former colleague. Heston takes care of her out of guilt, but his reluctance to play a cheating husband shows and sweeps off every ounce of chemistry with Bujold. However, George Kennedy is perfect as a the tough, bulky but well-meaning cop, naturally suspended because of violent behavior, and Victoria Principal, unbelievably beautiful and desperately unharmed despite all the hell she went through. The all-star cast seems like consisting to throw away big names and pretend we would care for them, but it all depends on the performances, and they are unequal. Bujold does her best to save her little boy before the providential rescue of Richard Roundtree as a stunt driver, but the kid was so dull and bland I almost regretted he wasn't the typical smart-ass. It didn't even help that the film featured many actors at the peak of their careers but whose appeal can hardly translate to today's audience.However, I've got to hand it to the film; it has one hell of an ending. Notorious for his straight-laced opinions, Heston demanded that his character would die rather than surviving his wife. He suggested the idea of having his character being killed while trying to desperately rescue his wife from drowning, abandoning the chance of happiness in the name of his marital vows. He plunged himself to a certain death but that transcended the tragedy of his character and create an even more shocking impact, had he survived like any typical hero. His death echoes the heroic demise of Frank Scott in The Poseidon Adventure but it allows the film to end in the kind of depressing, yet satisfying note, characters arc-wise.It was the perfect idea to let the last word for George Kennedy, who, despite his physical and manly strength can hardly prevent himself for crying while realizing what Los Angeles has become. It's true some flaws can easily be redeemed by a powerful ending; the last minute of Earthquake, with all its nihilistic material drowns the technical and written imperfection as effectively as the Manhattan Den sends the water down L.A. sewers.

He, on the other hand, is perfect as the husband of a very, haggard-looking Ava Gardner, who should have been cast as the sister of Lorne Greene, as opposed to being his daughter. Marjoe Gortner is forced to wear, aside from Samuel L.

Richard Rountree was on hand, solely to provide some color; thus, his role could have been called heroic Negro on motorcycle. A poor letdown for such an actor that had flaunted his African-American masculinity so well in the series of Shaft films.Obviously, Walter Matthau was smart enough to have his contribution to this turkey uncredited.Even John Williams' score seems to be recycled from his composition for both of Allen's films.

Although it takes a little under an hour to get to the big event (most similar movies only take about twenty), it doesn't seem like this  director Mark Robson and screenwriters Mario The Godfather Puzo and George Fox (actually, Fox was brought in to simplify Puzo's original screenplay because it was too complicated to film) skillfuly weave to storylines together to form a cohesive cast that is now cliched, simply because it was one of the movies that set the trend.  Anyway, the actual earthquake itself is SPECTACULAR. Without the use of todays computer wizardry the effects are chilling (excpet the bit with the blood flying at the camera).  It utilises both live action (in camera) effects, models and a combination of both.  In the process of leveling Los Angeles, the crew managed to all but destroy the Universal Back lot where much of the exterior's were filmed.  A multi-million dollar model of LA was destroyred convincingly and now stands in the pre-ride experience at the film's ride in Universal Escape, Florida.  The initial aftermath is convinving; Albert Whitlock (one of the most respected VFX people in the industry) created countless matte paintings of destoryed LA that when combined with the live action shots and fires look stunning.  SPOILER!!!! LOOK AWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!!!!! The scene with survivors sheltering in the basement shopping levels of the supposedly earthquake proof Wilson Plaza being buried alive in an aftershock is... WOW!  It uses a complicated combination of live action stunts, pre-shot sections of the mall collapsing around our ears then matted in and blue screen shots of people falling from height to create the illusion of the huge mall collpasing, along with a stampede of people running from the buildings as it collapses.  The finale of the collapse of the Hollywood Reservoir Dam is one of the best sequences in movie history; ir is also one of the strangest in such event movies.  Charlton Heston didn't like the ending he was given and asked for it to be changed.  Much to Robson's protests, Heston had script approval and so, when his bitchy wife (Ava gardner) gets swept away by flood waters he chooses to rescue her and in the process the two of them die, leaving the sexy Genevieve Bujold, who played Hestons mistress, alone.  A very downbeat ending which even John Williams end titles expresses, with none of the triumphant music he used in the endings of The Poseidon Advenutre and The Towering Inferno which he also scored.  Indeed, the last line in the film is, This used to be a hell of a town officer. All in all this is a superb movie that still looks good along with The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno.

The acting alone dwarfs that CGI crap-fest that is today's lobotomized excuse for a narrative. The cast has good acting in it especially Heston, Kennedy and Greene. Sensurround was always a sign the movie was in big trouble. The other two big films Midway and Roller-coaster also were bombs. The rumor at the time was that preview showings of this movie had walk outs and the studio plastered the Sensurround logo all over everything. It does sound great on Blu Ray with the restored Sensurround track much better, ironically, than San Andreas. Besides superior acting, did anyone else notice that San Francisco, after the earthquake, in the new movie, seems to have had all the survivors beamed into outer space? Where are they? The Rock's daughter perambulates around amidst an apparent ghost town. Here, the costs of the earthquake in human suffering and citizens without protection from nut jobs with guns, working for the National Guard, helping themselves to helpless women they desire. This is the strongest point missed by the scathing criticism, yes the love triangle with Heston, Bujold and Gardner is way too long, but look at the contrast with how the after effects are dealt with compared to the CGI fantasy?The next big improvement is people help other people here; see, Heston doesn't drive by oblivious to all the suffering around him. All through this movie people are helping others, total strangers. What is so funny about San Andreas is how the Rock has a helicopter and he flies obliviously over all the people who could use some help. I don't have to tell readers from other countries reading this how incredibly narcissistic America has degenerated into. San Andreas is the culmination of a string of movies Star Trek Into Darkness, the man saves his precious baby while killing fifty strangers, oh well, oops! Man of Steel where Superman levels Metropolis, but hey, he saves Lois and a token family. Earthquake is plenty silly in parts, it suffers from way too much soap opera sub- stories yet if you wish to appreciate it more contrast it with San Andreas; other human beings do not even exist to these self-absorbed narcissistic effects junkies. I own the movie for the performances especially Kennedy who exceeds Heston here. Another contrast is quite hilariously ironic, for the bad looking effects generate much more suspense than the beautiful CGI of San Andreas. Show of hands, how many people thought the Rock wouldn't make it up the side of that tsunami? See, Heston buys it here, a note to hardcore 'I am Moses' Heston haters. In San Andreas, part of the boredom is we know the Rock is invincible and this kills any real suspense. Here, when the dam breaks, they are trapped in the sewer system and the approach of the water creates real suspense. Sadly, money doesn't necessarily make a good movie as we all discovered with Prometheus. Young people, if you hated Towering Inferno, the best of Allen, don't watch this it is one of his worst. When I read all these acidic reviews, yes, it is bad, but it is Citizen Kane compared to San Andreas. There are not supertankers dropping multi-ton containers next to the Rock's motor boat and he gently swerves around them. The suffering, aftermath and the suspense tower over the new effects lobotomized special. I will not own The Swarm and this was borderline but please, it is a much better delineation of an earthquake and its aftermath. Heston's dying is well done and performed trying to save another. Nobility, try finding it in a modern movie Good Luck. A Mediocre Movie But Better Than San Andreas.

Basically it starts like any regular day in Los Angeles, California, construction engineer Stuart Graff (Charlton Heston) does not have the best relationship currently with his wife Remy (Ava Gardner), as she is easily made jealous and is possessive, so he has been having an affair with actress Denise Marshall (Genevi√®ve Bujold), the widow of a co-worker. Remy tries to convince her father and Stuart's employer Sam Royce (Lorne Greene) to influence husband to stop seeing the other woman, and meanwhile rogue L.A.P.D. policeman Lew Slade (Cool Hand Luke's George Kennedy) is suspended and considers quitting the force after punching another police officer, and perverted grocery store manager Jody Joad (Marjoe Gortner) is lusting after the sister of Rosa Amici (Victoria Principal), the sister of Sal (Gabriel Dell) who works with daredevil motorcyclist Miles Quade (Shaft's Richard Roundtree). All of these characters' lives are threatened when all of the sudden the ground starts to shake, to the point that it becomes a powerful earthquake, buildings fall apart and are destroyed, hundreds of people are injured or killed in the falling debris, and this lasts for six to nine minutes, until nothing but devastation is left. The surviving characters all try to help themselves and each other out of the city ruins, whether it be caught in collapsed buildings, in lower levels or underground locations, and of course trapped under the concrete and other fallen construction materials, and the final blow comes when the city dam comes apart and sends a rush of water and sweeps people away, but it is all over eventually. Also starring Barry Sullivan as Dr. Stockle, Lloyd Nolan as Dr. Vance, Walter Matthau as Drunk, Monica Lewis as Royce's secretary Barbara, Lloyd Gough as Cameron, Licence to Kill's Pedro Armend√°riz Jr. as Chavez and John Randolph as Mayor. The 1970's was the golden age for the disaster movies, with The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno among the most successful, but this one offered something that the others did not, cinema goers could experience the impact of the destructive earthquake forces in their seats, as many cinemas were equipped with chairs that vibrated so it felt like you were in the film. It admittedly takes a while to get to the actual earthquake of the title, but once it does you will not be disappointed to see many large buildings and bridges come apart in the destruction, it lasts a good amount of time, and some of the moments as characters try to save themselves is alright as well, a watchable and standard disaster movie. It won the Oscars for Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score for John Williams.

Gardner may be in her early 50s but Greene does look older than his real age (I was surprised to find out how young he was. That white hair is NOT very youthful.)

The effects are the best part and they start about 50 minutes into it, so skip ahead if that is all you really are interested in seeing. They did win a specially awarded Oscar as FX was not a regular category. A citation for the Sensurround and a win for Sound also happened. Some of the acting is just fine, it's the dialog that does it in. The animated blood splat came about because a more gruesome death was edited out after previews but before release.

Fans of 1970s Cheese Whiz will be in seventh heaven. The visual effects and the spectacle are worth seeing. The human stories much less so. Gardner is still ravishing, but she is stuck with a thankless role as Heston's shrewish grasping wife, and there is no way in hell that she is Greene's daughter given that only a couple of years separate them age-wise. Obviously someone in casting was having an off day. Roundtree is shoe-horned in to woo the cool 1970s blacksploitation crowd, but it would have been nice if someone had actually written him a role. We last see him in the film laughably seeming to outride a tidal wave on his motorcycle, but the film never even gives his character any closure. Most cast members handle themselves adequately, but there are a trio of horrible performances that deserve special mention. Heston and Bujold are especially dreadful here. Both serve up heaping servings of pure ham - a situation typical of Heston, if not necessarily Bujold. Heston apparently still seems to think he is playing in Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments and never is remotely believable - gnashing his teeth and staring skyward, while pontificating. The worst performance comes courtesy of Gortner, who contributes what could conceivably be the lousiest performance in a disaster film (and that covers a lot of ground). Gortner, whose history as a successful tent revivalist who notoriously returned to the fold to expose the chicanery behind the scenes (a story more interesting than anything in Earthquake), must be much more charismatic in person, because his acting here is atrocious. Sweating profusely and perversely ogling Principal while stroking his rifle, every moment of his on screen is torture. The film is arguably at the top end of the disaster movie genre, but again that is not saying much. Go for the visuals and savor the hamminess, but definitely don't expect greatness.

A minor earth tremor hits Los Angeles & using a new method a scientist predicts that Los Angeles will be hit by a huge earthquake measuring over seven which he believes will cause thousands of death's & millions in property damage, however his boss is fearful of causing a panic & sits on the information. Eventually the big earthquake hits & leaves Los Angeles in ruins with thousands of injured & dead, ordinary people do their best to help the trapped & injured but continued aftershocks mean the danger is far from over...Produced & directed by Mark Robson this was made to cash-in on the success of the disaster film, probably kicked-off by The Poseidon Adventure (1972) every major Hollywood studio wanted to make a disaster film & Universal offered up Earthquake which I have to say I really didn't think was that good. The disaster film followed a clear & defined pattern, a collection of seemingly unrelated people are thrust together after some sort of disaster that ranged from buildings on fire to capsized cruise liners to volcanoes to an earthquake here, for a start Earthquake is a very slow going film & next to nothing happens for the first forty five minutes & even when the earthquake hits it's not very exciting & I prefer disaster films that take place within a closed environment so there's no escape unlike in Earthquake with it's fairly shoddy set-pieces like live electrical cables, buildings without stairs, plunging elevators & collapsed dams. The character's are all dull & forgettable from an architect to a disgraced cop to a daredevil motorbike rider, the weird national guard guy Jody just seems totally random & like he belongs in a different film, the dialogue is stiff & no-one comes across as that likable. I was left feeling pretty disappointed with Earthquake, I just expected something much more fun than this plodding & oddly dull film that never really grabbed me.Originallt released in 1974 to theatres with the 'SenSurround' gimmick whatever the hell that was. When aired on US television in the late 70's a lot of new footage was shot & added to pad the run time out for a two night slot, apparently it still turns up on telly occasionally but I don't think it's ever been released on DVD. The special effects are alright, some of the model shots look a bit fake but generally the effects here work quite well. I never found any of it that exciting, I found the earthquake boring, there's this rumble on the soundtrack as the camera shakes & that's about it for ten minutes.On a budget of about $7,000,000 Earthquake did massive box-office business & took nearly $80,000,000 so it's surprising that no sequel was ever made although a script was written. The acting is a little wooden here, both Charlton Heston & George Kennedy teamed up again for the disaster film sequel Airport 1975 (1974).Earthquake is a rather lacklustre disaster epic that failed to capture my imagination or excite me, I didn't think that much of it & I think there are better disaster films out there from this era.

Here is a movie that has high production value in terms of its special effects, but is of low quality in regards to its character and story development. What makes Earthquake work is the fact that is in love with film-making and it is enthusiastic for the silly, low-key genre that it stems from.Earthquake is, I suppose, on paper a film that could have been a 1970s masterpiece but comes off as a 1970s cult favorite. The movie revolves around several everyday people in downtown Los Angeles on the day that a series of violent earthquakes begin to tear apart the city. Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner are a married couple whose matrimony is falling apart along with the buildings around them, George Kennedy is a troubled but goodhearted police officer, Richard Roundtree is a stunt cyclist wanting to show off his skills, Genevieve Bujold is a widow with a soft spot for Heston, John Randolph is the wearisome mayor of the city, and so on and so forth. The movie consistently cuts back and forth between their parallel story lines, meshing them together frequently, as some high-class and quite tense special effects sequences rumble the screen.That's the plot. And that's all the plot one needs and/or expects from a movie titled Earthquake. As the simplicity of its namesake suggests, the film is low-key and quite silly and nonsensical, but this is its charm. Earthquake has some big-budget production values, but because its director Mark Robson recognizes that he has a silly story, he makes the best of it. Robson was clearly a director who loved his job and had a great time entertaining his audience. That's why Earthquake works. It makes the best of what it has, it's enthusiastic for its genre and its audience, and comes off as very, very fun to watch. Even though I really didn't care about the fates of any of these characters, I did like the way the movie would juxtapose and cut from their stories back and forth and that it made an *effort* to develop them as human beings. In so many disaster flicks and special effects extravaganzas, especially of modern times, there isn't even a fledgling attempt to make it work. Earthquake makes the best of what it has. What's more, the cast makes the best of what they have as well. The actors and actresses realize the low quality of their screenplay and embrace it with such joy and enthusiasm, that they put the movie up a few notches.There are some great special effects sequences in Earthquake. The buildings that topple apart are not constructed out of crude cardboard, but of credible models that crumble and have layers and foundations, the life-sized sets designed to fall apart are fantastic and realistic, the pyrotechnics are beautiful to look at, everything's fun to watch. What I also like is how the earthquakes show up infrequently, but when they do arrive, they go on for extended stretches of time so as to keep things moving. Unlike a modern-day disaster flick 2012, which lost a lot of momentum in its third act, Earthquake keeps things moving and is a roller coaster ride when the action begins.Do I wholeheartedly defend Earthquake as a motion picture? Not really, I suppose. It's silly and weak-minded. But I do defend it as sheer popcorn entertainment. It is in love with film-making and with the disaster movie genre and comes off as a lot of fun. This is precisely the sort of movie that I, and many people enjoy.

I even remember going to see it with my sister and we both found it to be rather exciting and enjoyable. I did, and still am, fascinated with disaster-type films.Granted I was only 18 at the time, but boy oh boy, what a difference those years make.My taste must have really changed, more than I thought.I have been viewing various parts of this film on You Tube, and I must say it is really pretty bad when viewed today.What I cannot understand is why some of those major stars (Ava Gardner, Charleton Heston, for example) would want to be associated with this mess of a movie. Neither one certainly could have needed the cash. I 'm sure they made more than enough, during their hey day, and if it was just for the reason to keep their name before the public eye, well, I think I would rather be a forgotten star than be a part of this film.I must say, the action sequences of the actual earthquake are pretty scary and watchable; the special effects are quite good, but it takes more than that to make a good movie.An earlier reviewer said that all of the characters in this film look as if they came out of a trailer park in Bakersfield. I love that comment because it is so accurate and true. I couldn't agree more.The people in this film are very trashy and low life looking, even though some of the characters are supposed to be rather well to do. Ava Gardner's character, in particular, is so unlikable and bitchy that it is almost over the top and unrealistic, pushing the envelope too far, so to speak.I must say that elevator sequence really frightened me when I first saw this move-very disturbing-, but I agree with other reviewers that the use of the fake blood splattered at the end of that scene is totally unnecessary. I'm sure we all know that if an elevator drops down from that height, that people are going to be injured or killed. Very tasteless.Mark Robson, the director, was actually a very well-known and professional director, going back partly to the golden age of Hollywood. Again, why would he sign on to be part of something like this. very puzzling to me, that's for sure.All in all, for the special effects this is mindless and harmless entertainment, but not anything close to good movie-making, to be sure.

You see buildings being demolished left and right, people being crushed or flung screaming out of buildings. No music either--just the rumbling of the quake. Very impressive.

I thought it was entertaining in wallowing of everything bad about 70's pop culture. You have legends like Ava Gardner and Chuck Heston over acting. You have special effects a few steps above a Godzilla movie. You have Lorne Greene making a pulley out of panty hose. You have bad 70's fashion! There are two things that struck about this movie. One was that unlike other 70's disaster movies there was no positive message about humanity. No humans need to pull together to survive mind set. This movie just seemed to be carnage for entertainment value. But for a kid in the 90's I still found it unnerving. The second thing that struck me was the scene with Ava Gardner moaning on her bed with her sets of false eyelashes. Those things were HUGE! They must have weighed down her eyelids when(and if) she wore those things! All in all a great movie to laugh at when feels like enjoying the worst of the 70's on multiple levels. P.S. Unless panty hose were of steel fibers back in the day, I doubt they would have made a decent pulley. Something that's been bugging me for years.

All the others are just campy fun, this one reeked.  My nephew watched the first few minutes of it and noticed how badly it was edited together and he is sixteen.  Ava Gardner seemed like she was playing Elizabeth Taylor of the seventies.  G. Bujold's acting when she is in danger is hysterical (help. oh, please.  help.) As others have posted, the effects were bad, will always be amused by the cows in the overturned truck.  Listen for background dialogue, especially in the sudden Eutopia that sprang up in that basement (The building has its own generators' when the moving escalator is shown. 'Doctor, nurse, somebody, anybody, help me'  We laughed).  What was the deal with that street clown, acting like a mime?  When I watched it last, the Debra Lee Scott scene was missing.  Also missing was the strange bizarre, never-shown-elsewhere in the movie scene with the elderly woman who couldn't act in the pawn shop. Gortner's acting here and then in 'When you coming back, Red Ryder' seems to say he should have stayed a preacher.  He really did miss his calling, because it wasn't acting.   Lloyd Nolan is the doctor.  This man was without a doubt the most annoying I know everything person that I have ever seen.  Monica Lewis is 'Barbara'.  Her name was dropped like two thousand times.  Ms. Lewis became a staple of the disaster flicks (Her scene in 'Airport '77' when she enters the liferaft with Olivia DeHavilland screams Lucy Ricardo meeting a celebrity. Oh, Miss DeHavilland, I'm your biggest fan. I loved you in 'Gone with the Wind'.  And she doesn't say a word!) This movie isn't camp fun.  It was terrible.  And it was a blockbuster.

The Foley/background vocal artists alone provide many a pig-squeal of laughter from unsuspecting viewers, such as when grocer turned guardsman Gortner abruptly leaves his post and an over-emphatic woman exclaims, Oh my GOD! or when people in an elevator hear strange clanking noises, another emits, Holy Mother of GOD! Then there are the hilariously flaggellating stunt people swaying and groping at nothing, especially amusing once they've been swathed in bandages and fake blood or the cook who just happens to fall down right under a boiling pot of water which promptly falls directly on him! People scurry all over L.A., barely missing each other, as if it's some quaint little town. Heston, badly in need of a little Ben Nye powder in the early scenes, is good at being heroic, even in his ugly, state-of-the-art 70's outfit and driving the SUV du jour. Bujold remains a lovely and fresh presence throughout, though it's a mystery why every single costume she dons is pink! As for Gardner.... You are sorely missed, you delectable ham! Who else could wring the hilarity out of a part like this and leave such an indelible screen impression?! She gets the film rolling with the uproarious opening line, Goddammit!!, and never stops emoting until her last gasp of air at the end. She plays an alcoholic named Remy (After Remy Martin??) and her snobby accent must be heard to be believed. So much has been made about the casting of Greene as her father, but that's only part of the story!! The original script had a scene which revealed that Ava's character had recently had an abortion (!).....as if menopause hadn't descended on this woman long ago! The script repeatedly treats the character as if she's some fragile young thing while Gardner, by now, could have effectively played Kennedy's mother! That's not to say she isn't utterly enjoyable in every frame of her limited screen time. She alternately chews the surrounding scenery and plays it wounded and vulnerable. Fortunately, the softer moments are outweighed by screamfests like, Laura..What about my Fathah?!! ...LAURA!! ...MY FATHAH!!! ...AARGH! and You're really going to see that Marshall BITCH, aren't you??! The only time someone out-camps her is when Greene forces his secretary (Lewis, Lang's real-life wife who wrung an amazing late-day career out of it and who was given increasingly showy roles in all of his mid to late 70's blockbusters) to provide a seatbelt for their makeshift chair-lift and barks, Give me your pantyhose, dammit! Someone insane who has nothing else to do will notice that Gardner in Earthquake and Lee Grant in Airport '77 both are second-billed, but have only about 12 minutes of screen time. They both play shrewy drunks who have one big scene, then descending smaller ones until they spoiler drown. These bookend performances supply appropriate medicine for those who can't get enough of over-the-top power bitches. The effects vary from impressive to tacky (check that truckload of plastic cattle going over the bridge!) and the editing/continuity is downright shameful at times, but the music is great and the silly moments don't discount some of the nail-biting set pieces. Avoid, at all costs, the dreaded extended version which inserts annoying and preposterous extra subplots to the already sprawling film.

The Airplane writers didn't need to parody this one since they couldn't have improved on the original.  After appearing in Shaft Richard Roundtree had to feel silly uttering his lines in this turkey.The visual effects weren't that great in 1974 and they look pretty bad today.  I saw this movie at a theater with Sensurround and the widescreen only magnified the lack of detail in the model buildings.  Godzilla trashed more realistic cities!  The skyscraper that appears to bend and warp was a reflection in a plastic mirror that was then squeezed by hand.  How about that animated blood that splashed during the elevator scene?  The herky-jerky camera work at LAX was a joke and I especially liked the plastic cattle in the truck that fell from the freeway overpass.Other '70s disaster films such as The Towering Inferno used models and matte shots with much more realistic results.  If you want to see a good earthquake check out MGM's San Francisco from 1936.The only thing worse than Earthquake is the extended television version with additional scenes, characters and a painfully long sequence in which an airliner attempts to take off before hitting a buckle in the runway.  In fact, this version had the only cool shot from the entire theatrical film edited out which was the stuntwoman with a face full of glass.Earthquake originally ran in four Chicago area theaters that were equipped for Sensurround.  One of the them, the United Artists, had to shut off the subwoofers because pieces of the ceiling were shaking loose and falling on the audience.  The theater where I saw this film was a twin and the extra sound really rattled the walls of the adjoining auditorium.Earthquake is a stinker that gives disaster movies a bad name.

Following in the footsteps of Irwin Allen, the producers of this would-be epic tie together a number of plot strands involving different characters, all of whom are about to be thrown into chaos as a massive earthquake hits Los Angeles. The running time is long and the cast list huge, but the focus is always on the natural disaster and the film never forgets that. I found it thrilling in the best old-fashioned sense; the first half has a gradual build-up of foreboding as we approach the impending disaster, and then the second half lets rip with numerous scenarios. There's a collapsing skyscraper similar to THE TOWERING INFERNO, a dam about to burst and looting amidst the ruined shop fronts.The special effects are dated, yes, but still surprisingly realistic. Footage of collapsing roads and the ground splitting apart never fails to take my breath away, and there's no reliance on rubbishy miniatures as in the later SUPERMAN. The human cast is also effective, with a good mix of old and young. Heavyweights like Ava Gardner and Lorne Greene fill out supporting roles while Charlton Heston excels as his usual square-jawed leading man type. We get George Kennedy as a mixed-up cop and Marjoe Gortner as a creepy soldier; Victoria Principal as a sexy young dame and Richard Roundtree as a motorbike stuntman. Heck, there's even Walter Matthau as a drunk; what's not to like? If you're a cinema fan like me, then the list of those names alone is enough to get you watching, and I wasn't disappointing. Sure, EARTHQUAKE can be cheesy, and it's the type of film looked down upon by highbrow critics. That doesn't stop it being a blast.

Five simple little traits to identify whether or not a contender qualifies as cheesy, clich√©d and popcorn 'so-bad-it's-good' blockbuster guff! Now remember, the film needs to comply to at least 3 out of 5 traits to be included in the 70's hall of disastrous cheese. So far the hall already features some strong competitors, like When Time Ran Out, Airport 1975 and Avalanche. Let's see if there's any room for Earthquake. #1 without producer Irwin Allen, there wasn't a budget for special effects and thus no movie. Hmm&#x85; success and fail. Irwin Allen strangely didn't produce this (although I'm sure he regretted that himself) but there's plenty of budget for F/X, probably thanks to director Mark Robson co-producing as well. Half a point scored, let's say. #2 all disaster movies star one major star (especially Charlton Heston and Paul Newman were prime choices) and a long list of secondary (like Ernest Borgnine, Leslie Nielsen, George Kennedy...) stars. Oh, that's definitely a success! Earthquake does not only star the prime names Heston & Kennedy, but also plenty of other big names like Ava Gardner, Lorne Greene, Richard Roundtree, Genevieve Bujold and Walter Matthau. Full point scored! #3 The characters are usually split into two camps with completely opposite ideals and/or initiatives. The camp with the lead star is obviously the triumphant camp. Fail, that isn't applicable here although there are plenty of people doing stupid things. Zero points scored. #4 Regardless what type of disaster we're dealing with, variants of the exact same perilous situations are always applicable. Success! We have people trapped in elevators, victims caved in and girls in peril that need to be rescued out of the hands of a madman! Full point scored. #5 always remember that, when the situation appears to be at it worst, it can and will still get even worse! And yet another success! When the people of L.A. are still licking their wounds from the major earthquake, there's an aftershock destroying the hospital. Also, just when our heroic protagonists are about to safe approximately seventy trapped people via the sewers, the dam is going to burst! Full point scored! Final score 3.5/5 and we have another winner! Unfortunately, however, this goofy and sadly unofficial measuring method is usually also the irrefutable proof that the disaster movie is quite inferior and can easily be skipped. You've seen the events numerous times before, expect the type of disaster is different. Mark Robson's Earthquake, which was oddly enough co-scripted by Mario The Godfather Puzo, has very few unique sub plots or extraordinary sequences to offer, except maybe of the misadventures of a psychopathic anti-looting brigade officer or a black Evil Knievel wannabe. The special effects in Earthquake are of a remarkably high quality level, with impressively collapsing buildings and a fairly accurate (I think) dam bursting. The main problem is that you have to struggle yourself through a whole lot of melodrama before you can enjoy observing these special effects. The earthquake itself can be seen before minute 50 and 57, but before that there's only the marital issues of Charlton Heston and the drunken encounters of copper Kennedy who has lost his faith in the force. The direction is rather tacky, although Mark Robson once made his debut directing a couple of truly terrific horror films for Val Lewton, like Bedlam and The Seventh Victim. Cheesy fun, if you don't mind clich√©s, stereotypes, fake sentiment and melodrama.

For some reasons the disaster movie was living a boom. In movies there was  (The Towering Inferno), (Earthquake), (Juggernaut), and (Airport 75). In TV there was  (Heat Wave!), (The Day the Earth Moved), and (Hurricane). I think, for one reason, that the success of (Airport) and (The Poseidon Adventure) at the start of the 1970s kind of defined the decade.I don't know about you, but (Earthquake) is one of my favorites. It has some of my best actors and actresses (Charlton Heston and Genevi√®ve Bujold for instances). The script made a tight pace and unpredictable series of events. The direction made dazzling image and good atmosphere. And most of all the special effects were &#x96; and still are &#x96; perfect. This last one is enough cause to call this movie competent and classic too.The thing is the cinematic dealing with the disaster was coarsely realistic. This movie Gives The Chills. You can feel and live the earthquake all along. The big sequence of it was historical, being one of the best, if not the best ever. Simply, the whole movie was made for it. Now, after 36 years, with the visual and sonic development nothing of that sort is portrayed. In most cases the matter shrank into a computer's games, with no feeling or real horror. It became so weak and cold. Watch (The Day After Tomorrow) to understand well what I'm saying, especially the CG wolves !The problems of it were few. (Lorne Greene) as the father of (Ava Gardner) was a joke since he's seven years older than her, both (Marjoe Gortner) and (Victoria Principal) looked like a porn stars with mostly terrible acting (partly I blame the script for it), and sure the infamous line of Take off your pantyhose. However, none of them could ruin the movie. In my opinion the real crime was not utilizing (Walter Matthau) in anything but a cameo.Speaking about crimes, the scripts of these movies just don't want to have a main theme for once, focusing &#x96; forever and ever &#x96; on the disaster itself as the movie's main event, lead and theme. I began to believe that it is a basic rule in the genre ! True, some points here were interesting, when the script kind of tried to embody the meaning of upside down; where the earthquake does with people what it does with the earth, uncovering hidden truths (the national guardsman is a psycho, the lead is just ready to sacrifice his life for the wife he was leaving,.. things of that matter). But generally not in a way that makes it a disaster movie with a top-notch script; or the one that I didn't watch yet. This is the climax of all what Hollywood achieved at the level of making a fake earthquakes at the time. So it has the worst and the best of the genre. It is shocking, fascinating and dark. Moreover no doubt that the highest point in it is being believable; this is one of the art's hard aims, isn't it ?

And then there was EARTHQUAKE, a 1974 release that tried to ride the tide of popularity and pretty much went bust.The basic problem with EARTHQUAKE is the plot. There isn't any. Oh, sure, there's some stuff about Charleton Heston, who is cheating on shrewish wife Ava Gardner with youthful and very wimpy Genevieve Bujold, not to mention sundry subplots (the tough but honest cop, the stunt cyclist, and so on), but the cast is indifferent at best, the dialogue is tiresome, and it is ultimately just a very lame and very silly build up to the disaster itself.EARTHQUAKE's big trick was a gimmicky thing that might have been dreamed up by schlock-master William Castle Sensurround. It was essentially a bass-heavy sound system that blasted out sub-bass frequencies serious enough to make the audience shake, rattle, and roll. Unfortunately, the system actually proved a little too successful for it's own good, causing bits of the ceiling to flake off upon unsuspecting audiences in older cinemas, and after one or two unsavory incidents a great many theatres refused to install it.Shorn of Sensurround, EARTHQUAKE is left with a very mixed back of special effects that range from the spectacular to the ludicrously bad. In any case, it is all too little and too late, and the best thing that can be said for it is that all the characters you least like get popped before it comes to an end. The DVD release offers a sharp, clear print, but there are no extras of any kind...

He explained how the special effects were done--Matte photography, flexible mirrors, etc.--and, at the time, to a junior high school kid, it was impressive.  Even now, as I watch it from time to time, I am impressed by how realistic some of the damage scenes were, especially Lorne Green and Charlton Heston engineering a rescue from a heavily damaged high rise.  True, with computer technology, this feat of the mid-1970s seems primitive, but it still stands, special effects-wise, as a milestone with movies such as The War of the Worlds, Crack in the World, and, yes, Star Wars.  As for the premise...well, a few more seismologists as writers would have increased believability--a M8.0+ on the San Andreas fault would not wipe out Los Angeles as depicted in this movie.

And, with that, it easily earned back it $7 million production costs, 8-fold, in no time flat.Unfortunately, Earthquake didn't even come close to living up to its disastrous potential.

Charleton Heston, Ava Gardner, Genivieve Bujold, Lorne Green, Victoria Principle and Richard Roundtree head up a great cast. The special effects are awesome, even to his day; especially when you factor in the great efforts to do this. Matting is purely a manual thing, no CGI here; such craftsmanship you can appreciate. Lots of craziness too, like the elevator scene, the plane on the runway, The cattle truck scene and especially Ms. Bujod's scene where the stilt houses are collapsing around her. Every concieveable consequence of an earthquake is shown here including the damn collapse at the end and pivotal characters dying in the finale.I remember seeing this in the theater with Senoround when I was young and it was truly an experience - and having been through my share of tremors in California I always think of this movie.(There are several versions of this movie, the 1974 version and an updated version from 1977 which includes some additional scenes with a plane landing during the quake (with Debralee Scott) made for the ABC TV debut of the movie - try to get this one) You want totally crazy yet credible 70's Disaster movie experience, I recommend this movie!

And it goes on and on for quite a long time. And buildings collapse and houses explode as gas lines break and a massive dam is threatened and people are buried in the debris, and they tumble to their deaths or the elevator that they're on crashes down, and ... and ... and ... By the standards of 1970's special effects that was really well done. Unfortunately, you also have to sit through the rest of the movie, which ... well ... ain't so well done!We get almost an hour of soap-ish type filler before the actual earthquake hits. Yes, I know that's mandatory in these kinds of films. It's as if somebody in the 1970's decided that adding all these personal subplots about the characters would make viewers more interested; maybe we'd get to know the characters and their lives better and we'd care more. Uh. No. I just really wanted to get to the earthquake and its aftermath. I didn't really care who was having an affair with who, or any of the other numerous subplots that got going in that first hour - although it was rather fun to watch one cop punch out another in an apparent dispute over jurisdiction and - believe it or not - Zsa Zsa Gabor's hedge (not that she makes an appearance.) Basically, I spent almost an hour thinking, can't we just get to the earthquake. Please. PLEASE! And then it comes - and it's great, and it lasts for a few minutes - and then it's over, and we get back into many of those soap-ish subplots, through which we see the aftermath of the earthquake. This was perhaps a little more interesting than the lead-up. For example, although it wasn't graphically depicted, I was a bit surprised to see a movie from this era depict a soldier apparently trying to rape a young woman. But really - the movie had telegraphed for a long time that the real suspense was going to eventually come from the dam bursting and how many were going to be saved and who was going to die as a result. So in that second part of the movie, we waited for that to happen. There was a lot of waiting for things to happen in this movie.This had a decent cast. These 70's disaster movies always seemed to be able to attract well known names, and even a few truly big stars. Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner are in this, for example. There were secondary movie stars like George Kennedy and Walter Matthau (in an inexplicably and totally unnecessary role as a drunk at a bar who basically just wants another drink no matter what's happening around him.) There was Lorne Greene (much better known for his TV work as Ben Cartwright in Bonanza.) And there was Victoria Principal (still a few years away from TV stardom as Pam Ewing on Dallas) as the almost rape victim - who I didn't even recognize, as she was made up in this really far- out curly sort of hairstyle. (I had seen her name in the credits and was actually looking for her and didn't recognize her until the closing credits revealed which character she was. I had to go back and look. Now - knowing her character - I could recognize her.)Some of those 1970's disaster type movies are a lot of fun, and pretty well done. I'd say this one doesn't exactly rank at the top (or even near the top) of that list. But the actual earthquake is fun. No doubt about that.

Thankfully, there's an all-star cast and some dazzling special effects that save it and in the end there's no doubt that it's worth watching if you're a fan of the genre. After all, the special effects won a special Oscar and I don't think anyone could argue that the effects are mighty impressive.The special effects are certainly the main reason to watch the film as we get to see a giant city fall thanks to not only an earthquake but there are also tall buildings on fire as well as a large amount of water from a dam that bursts. All of the special effects are quite impressive even to this day with the one exception being the blood splat during an elevator scene. The most impressive stuff deals with the actual earthquake as we get to see the ground crack in front of our eyes and buildings get ripped apart in seconds. The miniatures used are extremely believable and there's no doubt that the effects make you feel as if you're really witnessing an earthquake.As with any 70s disaster picture, this one here features a terrific cast with Charlton Heston leading the way as a man dating a younger woman (Genevieve Bujold) while trying to break away from his alcoholic wife (Ava Gardner). None of the three are Oscar worthy but they're entertaining enough. We've also got the King of the Disasters George Kennedy offering up a good performance. The supporting cast also includes Richard Roundtree, Lorne Greene, Victoria Principal and Marjoe Gortner. Walter Matthau also appears in an awful performance and role as a drunk.Speaking of the last two actors mentioned. There's a subplot dealing Gortner's character who we first see doing a nice act then seeing him getting picked on and then a really bizarre finale. I'm not sure why this character snaps but it's a really bad and somewhat embarrassing moment. Even the stuff with the Matthau character just seems to be from another film and looks awful here. The entire melodrama is pretty useless from start to finish and it's clear these stereotypes were just thrown together to be heroes or to die.EARTHQUAKE isn't a horrible movie thanks to the cast and there's no question that the special effects makes it a must see.

The primary players include an architect named Stewart Graff (Charlton Heston) trapped in a marriage to a grasping and desperate woman named Remy (Ava Gardner), who is the daughter of Stewart's boss (Lorne Greene). We also learn that Graff is having an affair with a struggling actress named Denise (Genvieve Bujold) who has a young son. We also meet a motorcycle daredevil (Richard Roundtree), his assistant (Victoria Principal) and an ex-marine turned sex deviate who works in a grocery store (Marjoe Gortner), not to mention a recently fired police officer played by George Kennedy, who I think, by law, appeared in all disaster films made in the 70's. The scenes when the earthquake actually hits and destroys Los Angeles are pretty effective, but the final third of the film involving the actual rescue efforts is dull and extremely hard to get through. The performances range from shrill to annoying and some of the casting is really hard to swallow (Ava Gardner as Lorne Greene's daughter? Seriously?), but I guess if you're really, really, bored, there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours. BTW, Walter Matthau makes a cameo appearance as a drunk in a bar and is billed under his real name, Walter Matuschanskayasky.

An all-star cast was assembled to take what little drama was there and make it more interesting, sort of a Grand Hotel weighed on the Richter scale. A few laughs (both intentional and unintentional) have made this a cult favorite with definite elements of camp giving it an almost midnight movie status.A romantic triangle (between husband and wife Charleton Heston and Ava Gardner and his mistress, Genevieve Bujold) is the foundation on which the story is created. Fortunately, that foundation wasn't used for the buildings in downtown L.A., otherwise they might have collapsed a lot faster. There's also a very young Victoria Principal as a troubled young lady who is the victim of an obsessive neighbor (the creepy Marjoe Gortner) and motorcycle stunt artist Richard Roundtree, and of course, that bar room drunk (Walter Matthau) who is too tipsy to notice the reason he can't swallow his shot is because the ground around him is shaking more than his alcoholic hands.Laughs come frequent here, not only with the unbilled Matthau (given credit under his real name to create a surprise cameo) but with Principal's very big afro and daddy's girl Gardner spouting insults at estranged husband Heston while papa Lorne Greene makes business deals as the earth collapses around him. There's the famous shot of a truck full of cows flying off a freeway overpass (the audience actually mooed when I saw this in a revival house) and several L.A. landmarks collapsing. It is just too bad that there has to be the soap opera set-up long before the shaking starts and that makes the film a slight bore.At the West Hollywood video store that I worked at, this film was checked out for weeks after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, as were other films like San Francisco, The Rains Came and Green Dolphin Street. L.A. residents needed some fictional shaking going on after that scary event which woke us up at 430 in the morning. It's really a little sick, one of our clerks told a local newspaper who called us up to find out if the real quake had an influence on our customers' video habits. Sick or not, real life disasters sometimes call upon our adrenaline and desire to find enjoyment after those scary moments have passed.L.A. audiences too found it humorous to see the Beverly Center blown up after a volcano appeared at the La Brea tar-pits and exploded in the movie Volcano. I had no idea that the theater I was going to where the movie was playing would end up being a part of the plot and joined in the audience by applauding when that sequence took place. Earthquake leaves the same sort of feeling, providing laughs of irony that still amuse us today.

This one is Heston's first, as he plays a middle-aged architect in L.A. who realizes that the types of buildings he's helped erect should have been an obvious mistake for an area plagued by regular earthquakes. He's stuck in a dead pseudo marriage with a real bitch of a wife who you'd just love to slap (the aged but once-gorgeous Ava Gardner). Her dad (BONANZA's Lorne Greene) is Heston's boss and father-in-law (hold on a second... Greene and daughter Gardner are only a few years off in age ... what, did Lorne father her when he was seven??). Anyway, Heston's character is smart enough to be openly cheating on his old battle-ax with a younger chickie pooh (Genevieve Bujold).Of course the bizarre castings are always part of the charm of these jeopardy pictures. So we've also got side plots with Richard Roundtree as an Evel Kenieval type of motorcycle daredevil, whose partner is played by Gabriel Dell (of the old Bowery Boys comedies). George Kennedy is a lot of fun as a hot-tempered cop who gets suspended from the police force for anger management issues. Marjoe Gotner plays a nerdy supermarket cashier who becomes a crazed gun-happy National Guardsman when pressed into public crisis mode -- and he's got the hots for a young and bosomy Victoria Principal (sporting a terrible afro). Walter Matthau provides intermittent comic relief as a drunk at a bar who remains oblivious to anything that's occurring around him in this disaster.There are a few earthquakes, with the Big Rumble being one occurring mid-movie that lasts several minutes, and levels all of Los Angeles. Chuck Heston joins Lorne Greene and George Kennedy in trying to save everybody else. The special effects still are mostly impressive and deliver the goods, except for an occasional misfire (like the spattered blood in a falling elevator). The main draw of a movie such as this is the catastrophic tragedy of it all, and this is well realized even if the sub stories going on around it are mainly fodder. When EARTHQUAKE was released in theaters in 1974, a special audio trick called Sensurround was developed to give the effect of the movie seats rumbling as if during an actual earthquake. **1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"The 1970s was a dangerous time to be alive","Date":"6 November 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Hilariously awful disaster flick like only the 70s could produce.

First up we have Charlton Heston, who also made the epic disaster film Airport 1975 the same year. Then we have the always great George Kennedy, who was in all of the Airport movies. In perhaps the movie's most ridiculous casting, Lorne Greene plays the father of Ava Gardner. Richard Roundtree is a black Evel Knievel type character. Genevieve Bujold plays Heston's mistress. There was always at least one adultery in these movies for maximum soap opera dramatics. Victoria Principal, wearing a particularly risible wig, provides the movie's eye candy. Best scene for me would probably be when a braless Victoria Principal opens her jacket to reveal a tight yellow t-shirt that leaves little to the imagination. Have mercy! There's many more stars including Lloyd Nolan, Barry Sullivan, and Walter Matthau playing a drunk wearing a pimp outfit. Matthau didn't even use his real name for this role. I assume he knew it was a turkey.But the real star of the picture is Marjoe Gortner. I had no clue who this guy was before I saw this movie. All I knew was he got the juiciest role out of all these former and then-current stars. He plays a dorky-looking manager at a grocery store who also happens to be a reserve National Guardsman who is taunted by some guys for possibly being gay. Oh yeah he's also a complete psycho killer and rapist who wears a wig when he puts on his Guard uniform. You can't make this stuff up! Undoubtedly this was all material Mario Puzo left out of The Godfather and decided to use it here instead.Look, it's a stinker if you view it seriously. I've heard people who saw it at the time it was released say it wasn't that bad but I have to assume they are like the people who saw Pacific Rim this year and said the same thing.

Subplots of some people who weren't very interesting were supposed to make us identify with what they went through. Unfortunately, there were few characters in this film whom I wanted to care about. Take a classic film that included an earthquake SanFrancisco with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy. They got it! They emphasized the story about 3 characters we cared about, and the 1906 earthquake was just part of the story of what happened to those people. I mean no offense, but the subplots here didn't make me care much about Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Richard Roundtree, Victoria Principal, and certainly not Marjoe Gortner (who always seemed to me to be as creepy in real life as he was in this role). Even Airport, another disaster pic 4 years earlier, concentrated on the main story lines -- Dean and his pregnant stewardess affair, and Burt and his marriage problems. We cared about those characters. Here...eh! I wasn't disappointed with the special effects here, because you have to put them in context with the time. Nothing could be computer generated. So, overall, I have to give the film fairly high marks for most of the special effects. I can even forgive the infamous livestock in the truck sequence. But I can't forgive the cartoon blood on the elevator. Nope...that lost points right there!

One devastated San Francisco in 1906 causing lots of deaths, and another one was felt in 1989. Between the two real ones there was this fictitious one developed with great impact in 1974 in the film directed by Mark Robson. Coming in the wave of the decade, disaster films with big stars and high tech special effects, Earthquake was a huge success, won Oscars and all, and presented an innovative sound system (Sensurround) to shook audiences in the theaters back then (sounds like the notorious Rumblerama from the fake production of Mant from Joe Dante's Matinee). However, on the opposite direction of The Towering Inferno this is quite an embarrassment that only wasted money and our time.Somewhat laughable and ridiculously long to make you bored, this tedious project hardly has something to make us involved, except for the awaited earthquake, that only occurs after one hour of presenting characters and their pointless and uninteresting personal dramas; most of the picture is just random conversations. The best sequence of this is George Kennedy's car chase scene (memorable to viewers of the infamous chainsaw scene from Scarface). This is the most exciting thing moment we can get.What's the point of having a great cast of stars (Charlton Heston, Genevi√®ve Bujold, Ava Gardner, Richard Roundtree) when their characters aren't interesting enough to make us care? To mention an strange example, even the villain played by Van Heflin in the outstanding Airport is a likable figure, we can feel empathy for him. Can't say the same for the characters here.But, thumbs up to the effective and very believable special effects and the terrific editing, a little impressive even today. The sound effects, well, only those who watched the movie when of its release might have something positive to say about it. We know that this film having being made now would be ten times better. To me, it failed in its entertainment level, left me wanting for more, didn't get much and I couldn't wait for the ending. Worths a view if you're interested in disaster flicks of the 1970's and to see Walter Matthau playing a happy drunk in the middle of all the confusion, granting some fun amidst the boredom of the movie. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Been in an earthquake?

It was with this in mind that my brother brought this movie around; another nostalgia piece we both saw at the time and one to compare the recent 'quake stuff with. The first thing you notice when the Big One hits is how long it goes on for. We had two (7.1 and 6.4 on the Richter scale), six months apart; both went on for well under a minute but they both left a hell of a mess. The one in 'Earthquake' is a cataclysmic eight-minute event, and frankly that wouldn't leave so much as a dog-house standing. Millions of people would have died. It took weeks before our city looked as good as LA does in 'Earthquake' but several characters go blithely motoring unimpeded through miraculously clean, level streets on their missions of mercy. No massive road-blocking piles of debris, no impassable upheavals, no road-clogging streams of abandoned cars and most oddly, no people. No dazed wanderers, prone injured, rubber-neckers, cops, soldiers, rescuers, medical teams, salvagers or looters; the streets are completely deserted. Having one of the official gathering-points situated in the basement of a large building is just insane. It's like trying to escape a flood by hiding down a sinkhole. Absolutely the last place anyone feels like going after a quake is into (or even worse, under) a large building, even if the authorities advised you to. Which they wouldn't because it's so monumentally stupid. Elsewhere there's the frankly laughable rickety-looking construction Richard Roundtree is supposed to ride a motorcycle through. It's so dodgy that not even the movie's stunt-rider could negotiate it, judging from the editing. What's worse is that the 'loop the loop crash' stunt footage is actually repeated, only the second time you're supposed to think it was successful. Early in the movie a state official balks at the logistics of evacuating four million people. Looks like somebody went ahead and did a great job anyway. Either that or everyone bar what seems to be a few hundred remaining victims took it into their minds to visit their uncle Bob and Auntie Susie that weekend. That makes it all the easier for Charlton Heston and George Kennedy to do pretty much all the rescue work in the 'red zone'. Also the ill-fitting 'psycho Jody' sub-plot was bizarre and jarred with the main plot. It was pointless except to subject an afro-wigged Victoria Principle (done up as Cleopatra Jones) to some short-lived menace. In real life, Jody would have been quickly relieved of command by being disarmed or killed by his men. Here they just kind of live with the triple murder and later on they even let him have a love-slave. In closing mention must be made of the shoddy special effects, not least of which is the infamous 'elevator crash' with its bright cartoon blood-splashes. Must have had Porky Pig aboard. All in all, 'Earthquake' is dull and overlong with mostly unlikeable characters and works better on period charm these days than it does on thrills.

Overall the movie works. There were good and bad points. The bad points Richard Roundtree played about the only minority character. It was set around Hollywood. If there was an Earthquake, why was it only affecting Hollywood? The women and children were seen as helpless. C'mon! Children are much better climbers than most adults. The kid could have gotten out of the drainage way. The women were seen as being completely helpless and dependent on the men. The movie was a bit too boring at times. I kept on waiting for all the details of the main characters' personal lives to end, so the Earthquake could happen. The good points When the action was there, the action sequences were quite well done for the 1970s. Nature was a prevalent theme. The area around Hollywood was very beautiful. The idea of houses built on fault and hilltops, really revealed how precarious things are in L.A. I liked the fact that when the graduate student discovered that there may be a major earthquake coming, he was belittled by his superior. Then, after the graduate student left, his superior immediately tried to take credit for the idea. I liked the casual attitude. Lots of people were ignoring the signs after the first tremor. It was only when two scientists were swallowed up by a fault, that the head seismologist reported the potential for a major earthquake to the mayor. George Kennedy's role was excellent. He was an old-fashioned cop struggling to live in the world of not offending anyone. He was a veteran cop, but he was really getting scapegoated for every little action he took. That's the real world. I liked how when the fight was going on in the bar, the Walter Matthau character was totally inebriated on his own, and Kennedy didn't interfere until the fight had been going for a long while. There was a religious message that people should be kind and care for each other. Earthquakes bring out the best and worst in people. So, if you are looking for a disaster movie from the 70s, I will say that today's filmmakers should take note. Most disaster movies of today have great special effects, but absolutely no meaning, dialogue, or plot. This movie was obviously written by very good script writers. I wish I could say the same about a lot of today's disaster films.

And even those less interested in film music, such as my mother, remember the John Williams music of the 1970s. But Earthquake has too little music. Granted, having no music during the big earthquake was a good idea, but during the rest of the film we should of had Williams pumping away - all the time - just as he did in The Towering Inferno. Maybe it was control freak Irwin Allen who requested that Williams pull out all stops with his Inferno score? If you did not see this film in a theatre in the 1970s, well, you have not seen it, or felt it, at all. Earthquake was more of a 1970s thrill ride than a movie. My delayed first screening happened in a Sydney (Australia) theatre in about 1979 when I was about 13. At that age I was probably too young to understand the adult characterisation in the film.

Wow! Should I have checked the spoiler box for this? I think this is the second worst disaster movie I've ever seen. Airport 1979 gets the grand prize! Earthquake is so dreary that the special effects couldn't wake me up. I saw it when it came out and again about a year ago on AMC.

My wife and kid and I watched it over our Christmas Break, literally! I hate this movie the way some of my students hate anything that requires reading or writing or thinking, which means the hate is deep, really deep. I think if a kid misbehaves in class and won't change his or her behavior, I should show the kid Earthquake as punishment. Unfortunately, the movie is designed for the viewer who doesn't read or write or think. So where's the punishment? Where's the justice?

I believe it won best special-effects that year at the Oscar's! The scene where the office workers are trapped in the skyscraper was actually built just about full scale on the Universal set, quite large for its time.

Yes, some of the actors were mismatched but who cared the focus of the film was the event remember! I think the advertisement was An Epic Event so we all knew it was a disaster flick from the get-go. And for those that don't remember (or too young to remember) the ladies had to remove their panty hose so the men could tie them around a chair they were going to hoist and lower injured people to the next floor below. Which reminds me, the scene when everyone runs for the stairs is quite horrific! Those stunt people must have went through hell! I was glad to see that women were also showing how well they could do as stunt extra's. Also, the TV added parts ruined this movie. Worse mistake they could do. Everyone stick to the original video.

Oh sure, Victoria looked great in those Miles on Wheels T-shirts, and Marjoe Gortner IS a better actor than Matthew McConaughy, but they couldn't hold a candle to the likes of Earnest Borgnine, McQueen, Hackman, Holden, or Newman. The only saving grace is an excellent pre-JAWS score by John Williams (who did score for Allen) and Charton Heston as an adequate replacement for Newman or Hackman.

Earthquake is not that kind of film, it's actually an excellent example of a disaster movie. Yes I know the acting leaves a lot to be desired, and it has its faults plot-wise, but it's good to see a disaster flick where the disaster isn't the main character.Earthquake takes its time developing characters and their relationships and building tension before getting to the Main Event. This is unlike films such as Daylight, where we get a basic meet-and-greet introduction to the characters before it all goes to hell. Sure characters continue to develop after the disaster, but it's knowing them well beforehand and seeing how they change as they cope with it that makes all the difference.For anyone out there thinking of writing such a film, Earthquake's structure is a good example to follow.

The script must have been generated by either the producer's nephew or a Magic 8 Ball. Walter Matthau as the drunk has the only intentionally amusing lines in the movie.

Earthquake struck a chord with Southern Californians and Los Angeles residents because, after discovering they were sitting on a fault line, theories arose that some day The Big One would come, an earthquake which would be so horrific and catastrophic it would make part of California into an island. Charlton Heston, no longer interested in appearing in dramatic and serious films like his 50's and 60's repertoire, catered to mass audiences by making mostly thriller films such as this one, though he was most noted for his performance in Planet of the Apes. As Steward Graff, a married man who, tired of his shrewish, career-oriented wife Remy (Ava Gardner in a great role) engages in an affair with a young single mother and aspiring actress Denise Marshall (Genevive Bujold). Other characters, like that of Jody (Marjoe Gotner) experiences a break-up with her boyfriend. Soon, all these issues are forgotten when a devastating earthquake strikes. The special effects, tame and risible by today's high standards and superior production values, were ahead of their time. LA seems to crumble and rattle, causing a panic as people flee downtown LA. The Capitol Records building collapses, Los Angeles Airport collapses, etc. The actors must be given credit for convincingly portraying people who would react in that believably frightened, insecure way. Among the cast of actors include Lorne Greene (better known as the Captain of Battle Star Galactica and was that Walter Matthau in a non-speaking role as a pathetic drunk, drinking away in a bar while the earthquake happens ? But this film is not to be taken too seriously, as it was not a wake-up call or anything of the sort. It was a new form of cinema that entertained mainstream Americans. It's a document in 70's cinema. While I find that The China Syndrome  and even the lesser known The Day After to be the better films of this time, Earthquake is enjoyable and Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner are excellent. So take a look at this film and never mind the absurd scenario of an unimaginable earthquake that destroys LA which is yet to happen. "}{"Title":"Stupid characters! Stupid situations! Stupid movie!","Date":"7 January 2006","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" I remember watching Earthquake at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood in February 1975. I was about 13 years old. The Sensurround effect, making the seats shake like you're in an earthquake, was effective. Earthquake was released the same time as The Towering Inferno and a few months after their initial releases, numerous theaters showed both movies in a double-bill called Shake and Bake.Even though I was only 13, I knew it was rather stupid that an underground parking garage was used as a shelter. It was obvious that an aftershock was going to occur.Even I thought it was rather odd that Lorne Greene and Ava Gardner played father and daughter.I wonder if Pam Grier or Tamara Dobson were considered for the role eventually played by Victoria Principal. Then the Universal props department would not need to have an actress wearing a phony curly afro wig.That elevator crash with fake blood hitting the lens should have been edited out of the original movie. It made the scene funnier instead of terrifying. It's been so many years and I'm still wondering what happened to Richard Roundtree's character. You see him riding his motorcycle trying to beat a massive tidal wave caused by a dam break.How did Genvieve Bujold survive all of those homes that collapsed during the quakes? She gets a 10 out of 10 for all of those flips, tumbles and dodges. (Yeah, I know Bujold had a stunt double. The double deserves a 10 as well.) On watching the extended, heavily-edited television version, Debralee Scott had the unfortunate task of trying to convince viewers that she's in that plane trying to land at LAX. (How many times did I see those same potholes on the landing strip?) I think Walter (Matuschanskayasky) Matthau's funny cameo appearance was the right way to watch Earthquake inebriated.

I thought great, a long OK movie where I don't have to think too much and it will make me feel better. Boy was I wrong. I had seen this in the theater when I was eight and again on TV with the radio tune in and thought it was the coolest, I was eight. I had seen it several times after and could never make it all the way through, but I tried again. This movie is so dull and cheesy I could not help giggling my way through half of it before I turned it off. 50inch wide screen high-def and surround sound didn't help a bit. And this is why...1. The pace of the film is so slow and characters so boring you don't even want to wait for the quake. And when it comes the ridiculousness of it is so overwhelming I laughed my ass off when I guess I should have been feeling bad for the lost souls. Best shot is when the guy is up on that house with stilts six minutes after the quake starts and is still holding a beer and a piece of fried chicken then drops 40 feet along with half the building but is still scampering down the hill at the end unscathed. And what's with the animated splash of blood when the elevator crashes? How did they come to a decision that that worked? Or the AMAZING stunt by Miles Quade that is just really nothing at all even for it's day but they have to say Evel Kenivel's name twice because he was so popular at the time.2. The acting is about as trite and over the top as you can get, but the lines are so badly written it is not really their fault, the director should have known better but it seems he liked everything he saw on the first take.3. One wordCARDBOARD. The Special effects look like they did them on their lunch hour. I'm sure a lot of people put their efforts into this but please. I read in one of the other comments that we should have pity on this mess because it was from the 70's and only had a 7 mil budget. What about films like 2001 A Space Odyssey, this film was six years earlier and only had around a 10 million dollar budget and it still looks incredible today. It's called good direction and caring about the product. This looked like it was rushed out faster then most of these actors careers.I felt sicker after watching this disaster of a disaster movie then I did when I started. This one was just plain DUMB.

I would be interested in the relationships between the characters in terms of the love interest, but sadly it's not particularly interesting and it has to be truncated by a massive natural disaster which does sort of throw things off.So what's the artichoke? Stewart Graff is a Los Angeles architect, who tires of his dead-end marriage with his argumentative and attention grubbing wife Remy. Secretly he has an affair with the widow of a friend and actress Denise, who has a young son named Corry (at this point it could be a completely different movie!). We're then introduced to a Policeman named Slade, a Daredevil named Miles, and a grocery store owner/National Guard officer named Jody. What follows are a series of quite long winded character introductions that go on for the best part of an hour, which would be okay if it weren't for the fact that it goes on for too long! Anyway, about an hour in the horrible Earthquake strikes, and sends our characters into dismay and a fight for survival as their city crumbles around them, both socially and physically.Now, the good points. The parts involving the earthquake are played very well. The practical effects involving the destruction of the city are very well done, although with the cases of obvious models taking you out of it a bit. Also, some of the characters we meet you do find yourself siding with, like George Kennedy as Officer Slade, trying to keep order and justice in a city ravaged with destruction.But as for the rest, aside from the long drawn out character moments, there are some superbly dumb moments. For example, after the earthquake has struck, they setup a temporary refugee centre in an underground car park, at a time when violent aftershocks are bound to happen! And sure enough...Also, some of the characters act stupidly too, like Slade is suspended from his job for chasing down a criminal although he leaves his department's jurisdiction. The higher ranking officials seem to have a thing for dismissing evidence of an upcoming disaster even though there's nothing to deny the fact that it's going to happen. Although these may be personal peeves, they are ones that do take you out of the movie because you can't help but notice how stupid some of these characters are.Bottom line, this movie is a fairly generic natural disaster film, but sadly laden with very slow character moments and very silly decisions that do become quite jarring. But I will say this, when the disasters do happen, the practical effects are very good and will keep you gripped, but the problem is you have to go through a lot of very slow and quite dull moments. If you can survive those, then I'd say give it a watch if you want just a silly disaster film.

A lot of big laughs. Aren't disaster movies supposed to be serious? There's nothing funny about disasters in real life where people are tragically killed or seriously injured. Also, there's nothing funny about all the damage a certain disaster can create where the cost can be over a billion dollars. But the people who made Earthquake must have thought they were making a comedy because I was reeling in laughter through much of this. The title tells it all, with Los Angeles as the setting. Earthquake is excellent when the earth is shaking. It's stupid when it isn't. Also, this movie has a good cast of actors who embarrass themselves with some of them badly miscast. For one thing, do you buy Ava Gardner as Lorne Greene's daughter? Richard Roundtree (the original Shaft) as an Evel Knievel wannabe? Or how about the great Walter Matthau (billed under his full name Walter Matuschanskwyasky) drunk as a skunk in every scene he's in? I could hardly understand a word he said in the entire movie. And how about Marjoe Gortner as a.....never mind. I won't even bother going into that character. Charlton Heston, George Kennedy, Genevieve Bujold, and a young pre-Dallas Victoria Principal are the other actors trapped in this goofy mess. The thing that surprises me is that Earthquake was co-written by the great Mario Puzo. Here's a man who was a writer of one of the best movies of all time (The Godfather) and then he writes this? With a writer like Mario Puzo, wouldn't you think that the screenplay for this movie would have been smarter? The screenplay for Earthquake is dumb. Real dumb. But the movie isn't all that bad. The special effects are impressive (by 1974 standards), and there's some suspense and excitement in between the idiotic dialogue. Earthquake, along with 1979's Concorde Airport '79, are disaster films with howlingly silly moments. If you like comedy with your disaster films, Earthquake is for you.** (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Shake,Rattle and Roll!","Date":"19 May 2000","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I was seven when I saw Earthquake for the first time in 1974, in my hometown's huge theater (before the horrid birth of the multiplex),complete with Sensurround effects. Viewing it again as an adult,I must admit that it is one of those bad films that you can't help but love! The film's story (written by Mario Puzo of Godfather fame!) centers around the lives of a small group of characters caught up in a cataclysmic earthquake which virtually destroys Los Angeles. The cast includes Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, Genevieve Bujold, Richard Roundtree, Marjoe Gortner and Victoria Principal. Among the film's highlights aren't the special effects (which seem dated in the age of Terminator 2 and Titanic) but the rescue sequences involving Heston and Greene in a skyscraper, and Roundtree and Bujold in a hazardous canal. The rest of the film must be enjoyed for pure camp value the wildly overacting of Heston and Gardner, Principal's afro; an out-of-place cameo by Walter Matthau as a drunk; Gortner as a sexual deviant; Gardner cast as Greene's daughter when they are actually only seven years apart in real life; Heston's futuristic-looking silver Suburban,complete with a T-top!; the silly romance between Kennedy and Principal,an obvious copycat of the Red Buttons-Carol Lynley May-December romance in The Poseidon Adventure. The screenplay is pretty awful,complete with many more holes than the earthquake would have caused (did Roundtree outrun the flood on his motorcycle? why does Principal's brother Sal, played by Gabriel Dell,disappear half way through the film?). Overall, the film boasts enough suspense to keep the viewer somewhat engaged, although The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno did it much better. My score 7 out of 10. A guilty pleasure!

The first word of dialog in this film, which shows you what kind of profane pig this woman was, is GD! screamed out by her. She must have given hubby Frank Sintra an earful a few times. Three minutes later, Gardner blasphemes again. This film seemed to be a haven for a few washed-up stars like her, Charleton Heston, Lorne Greene , Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, etc.Speaking of the 1970s, this was typical early '70s schlock, a half decade of the some of the scummiest, worst films ever made. A handful of films each year from 1970-75 were excellent but for every Godfather there were 200 total clunkers and generally-depressing films. It was a bad time for moviegoers. Things started to get better in 1976.Disaster movies were the rage and many of them turned out to be nothing but long-winded soap operas, like the airplanes-ready to crash and big boat-sinkings, skyscrapers on fire stories, etc. This movie got huge hype like the rest, but has little substance, only terrific special-effects in a few spots. I have to hand it to them for that they didn't computers to do most of the work. Like Gardner, Heston must have been desperate to keep his film career going, too. As a fan of Heston's, I was sorry to see him in this movie. At least he was better than Richard Shaft Rountree and George I never saw a disaster role I could turn down Kennedy. The special-effects look either great or stupid, depending on the scene. I guarantee you one thing the people IN the disasters look idiotic. In real life, all people would either freeze in horror or run like hell. Witness the reaction at 9-11. They don't stand there and scream or jump up and down waving their arms, like they do in this film! It's almost laughable. Actually, it is laughable.This film, like most of the disaster films of the early '70s, might have had great dramatic impact back then but look so hokey now it makes you shake your head in disbelief. Also, all that melodrama and just plain slow pace, would be totally intolerable today. That's probably the main drawback too much soap and not enough suds.

Earthquake is a 1974 American disaster film that achieved huge box-office success, continuing the disaster film genre of the 1970s where recognizable all-star casts attempt to survive life or death situations. The plot concerns the struggle for survival after a catastrophic earthquake destroys most of the city of Los Angeles, California. Directed by Mark Robson and with a screenplay by George Fox and Mario Puzo, the film starred Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, Genevi√®ve Bujold, Richard Roundtree, Marjoe Gortner, Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, Victoria Principal, Monica Lewis and Walter MatthauSUMMARY The film opens on Stewart Graff (Charlton Heston) jogging underneath the Hollywood sign. Back home, as he finishes his workout on a resistance machine, his wife Remy Royce-Graff (Ava Gardner) starts her morning by picking a fight with him. At the peak of their argument, Stewart says to Remy, You'd hardly call this a marriage would you? After he's showered and preparing to leave, Stewart finds Remy unconscious with a bottle of pills nearby. Accustomed to her periodic suicide attempts, Stewart prepares to induce vomiting when a violent tremor shakes the bedroom. Remy bolts out of bed, revealing that she was faking. At the Mulholland Dam, two workers begin a routine inspection of the structure in response to the tremor. One of them is drowned in an elevator shaft, which has filled with water after the quake. In downtown Los Angeles, Sgt. Lou Slade (George Kennedy) and his partner Emilio Chavez (Pedro Armend√°riz, Jr.) are in pursuit of a suspect. They chase him out of their jurisdiction, finally crashing into the hedges at Zsa Gabor's house. After an LA County Sheriff yells at Lou for ruining Gabor's hedges, Lou punches him out. When reprimanded, Lou explains to his supervisor that the suspect had stolen the car, been stoned, and then driven over a 6-year old Mexican girl without stopping. To his disgust, he receives a temporary suspension. On his way to work, Stewart visits Denise Marshall (Genevi√®ve Bujold), an actress who is the widow of one of his friends and co-workers. He drops off an autographed football for her son and helps Denise run her lines for a scene she is shooting later that day. A junior staffer, Walter Russell (Kip Niven), at the California Seismological Institute has calculated that Los Angeles will suffer a major earthquake in the next day or two. He frantically tries to reach his superior, Dr. Frank Adams, who is busy placing seismic sensors in the field. Another tremor hits as Adams and his assistant are working in a deep trench and they are buried alive. The scientists at the center argue about whether or not to go public with their prediction of a major quake. The acting supervisor, Dr. Willis Stockle (Barry Sullivan), insists that if they are wrong their funding will be jeopardized. He also argues that the panic such a warning would cause could be worse than the earthquake itself. They agree on a compromise to alert the National Guard and police so that they can at least mobilize to help deal with the fallout. While checking out at a grocery store, Rosa Amici (Victoria Principal) realizes she doesn't have enough money to pay for all her items. Jody Joad (Marjoe Gortner), the seemingly kind store manager, insists that she keep the items and make up the deficit the next time she shops. Later, when he hears that the National Guard reserves are being called up on the radio, Jody leaves the store in the middle of his shift, revealing himself to be part of the reserve army. He goes to his run-down boarding house and changes into his NCO uniform, enduring the abuse and harassment of his bullying house mates who accuse him of being homosexual because he's got pictures of bodybuilders on his wall. Blowing off steam at a bar, Lou orders a double bourbon and ignores all the illegal activity he sees. A drunk (Walter Matthau, credited as Walter Matuschanskayasky) periodically wakes up to toast random people like 'Bobby Riggs'. Daredevil motorcyclist Miles Quade (Richard Roundtree) arrives with his partner Sal Amici (Gabriel Dell) and his sister Rosa. A pool shark collects $50 that Miles owes him, leaving him short for the propane tank he needs to do a stunt for a talent scout. Miles convinces Lou to loan him the money by having Rosa reveal a tight-fitting t-shirt he's marketing with his name on it. QUESTION What canceled Denise shoot? Who goes back to Denise's house? Who is in the running for the Company Presidency? Sam and most of his employees are trapped where? Who suffers a severe illness? Who saves Denise and her son? Who was arrested by the Natural Guard for looting? Who commandeers a truck? What does Lou and Stewart pretend to do? Who hears that another aftershock has threatened Wilson Plaza? Where are there survivors trapped? What does the crew use to the trapped people? What gives during a rescue? Who falls into the water? Does this person survive?MY THOUGHTS The only thing different between this picture and The Towering Inferno was that picture was a fire and this was an earthquake. To me this movie was boring after the earthquake because the only drama left was who was going to die and who wasn't. Based on this I give this movie only 5 weasel stars because it just wasn't that interesting.

It does have in it a fine cast trying their level best(most of them at least) to make this crap they are working with work. Los Angelos is hit by catastrophic earthquakes and we see how several characters evolve and react...and sometimes die. We get the cop with the heart of gold and the gruff exterior(George Kennedy). The rich, cheating, talented, and strangely heroic architect that made the buildings that are collapsing(Charlton Heston). Ava Gardner plays his snobby, spoiled, difficult wife and Lorne Greene her father. Marjoe Gortner plays a reservist who takes his power too absolutely. Throw in Richard Roundtree as a motorcycle daredevil, beautiful Genevieve Bujold as Heston's love interest, and afro-toting Victoria Principal filling out a tee shirt better than anyone else in the film - and you have the major players of Earthquake. There is also Lloyd Nolan playing, what else, but a doctor of course. What separates Earthquake from many of the disaster films of its era is that at one moment it wants to be taken seriously and at another it uses some real stupid special effect or cheesy element or tries purposely to be funny. Walter Matthau plays a drunk throughout the film and let's be honest here- he just isn't funny. Nor is that whole bit amusing nor is much of anything else intentionally. There are some humorous scenes of unintentional humour. Watching Heston garble some of the lines he has to made me wince. Gardner looks so completely out of it. Kennedy gives a decent turn as the cop, but for me Lorne Greene did the best job as a man trying to save those that worked for him in a high rise. Director Mark Robson, a guy who started out making fine horror/suspense films for Val Lewton in the 1940s, just doesn't seem to have his directorial fingers on the pulse for this film. The script meanders and the acting meanders with it. Add to this some very cheesy, less-than-convincing special effects and a poorly conceived ending and you get a bit of a disappointment in Earthquake.

The one difference between this film and all the others was Sensurround, which consisted of 4 large boxes positioning 2 on either side of the screen and 2 more on either side in the very back. Every time a quake hit the machines would rumble causing the theater to shake. In Chicago there were reports that the United Artists theater, one of the many long gone and forgotten movie palaces, actually had parts of the ceiling fall during performances which, no doubt, made it all the more real for the patrons. The results were quite effective and almost made the movie worth seeing. To sit and watch it on television is to see yet another silly disaster movie that had some decent special effects.Earthquake boasted the usual star studded cast headed by Charlton Heston and George Kennedy who did double duty that fall by also saving lives in Airport 1975. Also along for the ride are Genevieve Bujold, Ava Gardner, Lorne Greene (hilariously cast as Gardner's father of all people, Marjoe Gortner, Richard Roundtree, Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan and others.

When the big quake does hit the film takes off for a while but then grinds to a halt as the survivors look for one another and try to stay alive. It's a routine film that is an okay time waster but nothing more.

I tried to reason that it was made in 1974, and effects back then weren't so good. But I've seen movies made in the 1930's that are better than this piece of junk. Some unrealistic things are, would anyone go into an elevator during an earthquake?  Lean outside a window in a high rise building to take a look?  Squirting tomato sauce on the camera lens in the elevator scene really looked awful to denote blood.I think I could shoot a better movie than this with my 8mm Digital Sony Handycam.  To simulate an earthquake, a director must know you can't simply shake the camera about to create the effect.  In some shots that's all he did!  And the people were clearly standing as if unwavered. Acting is tolerable.

The movie takes about an hour to get started. The slow first half is intended to introduce the characters and provide character development. Problem is, none of the characters have enough depth for this to work. Once the actual earthquake occurs about an hour in, things start to pick up. But not quite enough for the film to work. The acting and dialogue are quite bad and like most disaster films, there's little plot. The real stars of this movie are the impressive post-earthquake sets.

Not only has yours truly seen this one, but we can honestly boast (if that's the proper term) of having viewed it through several times' as well as having watched the good parts (as such as there were) many times over.HOW, pray tell you ask, did such a dubious achievement happen per chance to fall our way?, Well boys and girls it is because I was employed at the time of its initial release and Mid-West Premiere as a Security Man for the United Artists Theatre, Dearborn & Randolph in Chicago. (They hired off-duty Chicago Cops.) ALTHOUGH, like most any movie, EARTHQUAKE had many moments, happenings and scenes that were enjoyable, clever and memorable; the movie as a whole lacked a certain continuity and intensity of delivery that such a calamity should automatically demand.BASICALLY, Universal & Company took an All-Star Cast, which was both spectacular and balanced; being purposefully designed in order to give it Something or more properly, Someone for Everyone. For starters, we have Mr. Charlton Heston (Moses, himself), Ava Gardner (fading Star from 1940's), George Kennedy (Best Supporting Oscar in COOL HAND Luke. Warner Brothers, 1967 as well as TV's 2nd Bumper Morgan), Lorne Greene (Canadian born TV News Anchor on the CBC & Greatest TV Father Figure since Ozzie Nelson), Geniveieve Bujold (zee beautiful & very talented Fronch Canadien born Actress extarodinaire), Richard Roundtree (accomplished stage actor who created the screen persona for SHAFT) and former juvenile-wonder Evangelist-turned Actor, Marjoe Goertner.AS for the supporting cast , EARTHQUAKE boasted of the likes of Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, John Randolph, Gabriel Dell (original 'Dead End Kid'), Scott Hylands (honest Schultz, that's the name), Pedro Arminderez, Jr. (John Wayne's buddy in THREE GODFATHER'S) and last bit not least, Hard-Boiled Haggerty (Pro Wrestler turned screen thespian).ADDITIONAL attractions included the up and coming Starlett, Miss Victoria Principal; she of the interesting tee-shirt modeling ability and future featured regular on TV's DALLAS. (Woo,woo,woo,woo!) The inclusion of a rather pointless Cameo Appearance by Walter Matthau (as Walter Matuschanskayasky) in which he portrays a comic drunk at the bar that L.A.P.D. Sgt. Lew Slade (Mr. George Kennedy) is drowning his sorrows.IN the best tradition of what we like to call the Microcosm-Type Drama, such as GRAND HOTEL, STAGECOACH, THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY and DONDI. The production team blends about six different life stories against the back-drop of the impending catastrophe. So we are treated to (or perhaps subject to) the tales of rich folks' marriage woes, poor folks seeking fortune, a sexually confused psychotic grocery store clerk/National Guard Officer**, the trials and tribulations of the primary governmental unit & first responder (the Cops) and the Earth Shaking responsibility on the shoulders of the Leaders of Government and Science.NOW added to the mix we have one final, revolutionary technical special effect. That was hailed as the new wonder of wonders in the film world. It was Universal's innovation for the augmentation of the Cinematic Art, SENSURROUND!!! THE MOVIE STUDIOS had long searched for gimmicks to help promote their on screen Stars in their latest Feature Film roles. The special screen additives have included from the earliest days of movie exhibition such varied contrivances as Color Tinting, Technicolor, Wide Screen, Multi-Camera Images ( Abel Ganz's NAPOLEON), Musical Score Accompaniment, Music & Sound Effects recorded on records, Musical Score recorded, Synchronized Sound (ALL SINGING, ALL TALKING), Warner Brothers' VIiaphone Records Synchronization, On Film Photo Sound (RCA, Western Electric), Cinemascope, Vista-Vision, Cinerama, Tingler. Smell-A-Vision, 3 Dimension (with those 3-D Glasses) right down to the Omnimax Theatre Screen Giants of today.ALL any of these processes were effective to various degrees and hence were repeated. However, the Suits in the Studio Bored Rooms (it's no misprint, Schultz) learned that there is no substitute for putting out good movies, funny cartoons & live shorts and that outstanding occasional must see Film for all.AS for the Revolution of Sensarround; let us say that it worked splendidly; delivering all of the rumbling, thundering noise and earth-quaking tumult that it promised. Its process and delivery of same was very simple, elemental even.FIRST of all, the Sensarround System was installed into the Theatre booking EARTHQUAKE. It would have to be done in time for the previews (the Trailers) of the Movie, which also had the Sensarround Process embedded in its soundtrack.OPERATIONALLY the several Sensarround machines positioned front, back, beside and above the audience would receive activation from the electronic signal sent as the movie hit a certain point in the movie's soundtrack. Once started it would not cease until it received a cease & desist order, a sort of auditory armistice.AS FOR how the system worked, all of that rumbling, shaking and noise caused the plaster and indeed the very foundation of the old United Artists Theatre to crack, fall and fissure. The building was at that time about 79 years old. It had been known at one time as The Apollo Theatre; later having been purchased by Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. D.W. Griffith, who named it The United Artists after their newly formed United Artists Film Corporation, a partnership formed in 1919.WE can't speak for any other cities or picture show; but as for ours the Sensarround Contraption was disconnected after a relative few weeks of showings.As for this Sensarround Process, we believe that there was only one more picture to feature it; that being something about Krakatoa. But, that my dear Schultz is another story.

Nothing can save it from being below ordinary. Easily one of Charlton Heston's worst films. Ava Gardner is ordinary.Part of the problem is that this came out at a time when theaters were experimenting with a special effect called sense surround. A theater playing this would have speakers in place all the way around the audience. They would turn up the sound and you'd shake. With this movie, that is all there was to warrant going to it.I did experience the effect in the theater sad to say. I kept expecting the script to get better throughout the movie and it didn't. Other movies using this effect were Midway & The Hidenburg. Out of the three, Midway was the best and even Midway had it's problems though when I saw Midway, you felt like you were on the flight deck of the carrier when the planes were taking off in sense surround which was pretty neat.Some of the sequences in this movie are just plain silly. The bake movie related to this is Towering Inferno but unlike Inferno which though hokey manages a couple of fire safety messages, this movie wanders without any message. Would watch this on late night TV if the only other show was a Billy Mayes commercial. Other than that, take a pass on this unless someone actually runs it in sense surround. Then, take your date and see if anything shakes off.Universal studios in Florida still had a stage set up to simulate how the effects were done for the quake in this movie that last time I was there. Skip that and see if they still have the Alfred Hitchcock display. That was way better.

Whether it was worth or not is doubtful, because the script of EARTHQUAKE is so bad that all of the big name actors in it are seen at their most vulnerable.AVA GARDNER is improbably cast as Lorne Greene's daughter. She was fading fast in the looks department and her role was not worthy of her abilities to create a believable character. CHARLTON HESTON is her hubby but he has eye on the much younger and still bubbly GENEVIEVE BUJOLD. There are other sub-plots going on but none of them manage to create more than an idle interest until the buildings start to crumble under a crippling earthquake.When one character says, Be careful crossing that bridge, you just know that's a signal for the next special effect to take place. The Special Effects did win an Oscar but look pretty shaky from the perspective of the passage of time. Come to think of it, I've seen even more spectacular effects in B&W films like THE RAINS CAME back in the '30s.Summing up Trivial plot is an excuse for L.A. to burn--not worth waiting for.
