I like the Faulkner-like story set in the South. I like the subdued, yet brilliant performance by Peter Fonda. I like the detailed shots of the art of beekeeping. The music...I just love this movie. The story centers around Ulee, a stoic beekeeper and honey maker. Ulee's son is doing time in prison for his part in a robbery. His son's wife is a junkie who walked out on her three daughters, leaving Ulee to raise them. Although Ulee is not an emotional man, you sense he loves his grandkids and son, he just has trouble showing it. Well, the mom comes back, his son's partners in crime come back and Ulee realizes that his simple life is in great peril. This is a wonderful family film and I think a performance by Fonda that is very personal. I highly recommend it.

For a start, it shows Peter Fonda is a truly accomplished screen actor and not merely Henry's son, Jane's brother or Bridget's dad. It is  a pity that he has had so few good roles to play over the years and his acting career has been largely disappointing. However,he totally brings the character of Ulee to life . Ulee is a decent man trying to do the right thing and when you see this film you are behind him all the way, willing him to overcome all the obstacles he encounters.This film, while a mostly straightforward simple tale,lifts the spirits and  is  a direct result of how positive the script is. Peter Fonda should make more films like this or he soon might find himself looking for the few good 'grandfather' roles out there in the movie world.

His performance is a masterpiece of understatement;  we can almost physically sense the roiling depths of anger and resentment that lie below his cold, almost imperturbable exterior. The crime subplot never takes precedence over the gripping family drama that is the movie's core. It is wonderful to see the various characters gradually becoming re-integrated into a functioning family; i.e. the daughter's appearing late at night in the work area to help Ulee, whose restrictions up to then she has mightily resented, with his backbreaking work.Few have commented on the double entendre of the movie's title. Ulee's Gold is, on its surface, the honey he works to produce. It is clear, at the film's conclusion, that the Gold is, in actuality, the family he has brought together again. (I suppose we could have a triple entendre in that it might also refer to the long-lost money that is at the crime subplot's core).

Peter Fonda (Oscar-nominated) stars as a bee-keeper in Florida who has lived a somewhat uneventful life.  He's raising his two young grand-daughters because their father is in prison and their mother is nowhere to be found.  When Fonda learns from his imprisoned son that his daughter-in-law needs his help, he rescues her from a life which has nearly been ruined by drug-use.  Fonda brings her back to live with him, but also learns from his son that two thugs may create trouble because of a score they (the son and thugs) pulled off years earlier.  Now the thugs want the money and Fonda must show emotional strength at his family's darkest hour.  The film is above-average in every aspect, but it is Fonda that makes the film as good as it is.  Everyone else is adequate, but this is his show.  The screenplay and direction are just good enough to keep the film above water.  Overall a good film.  4 stars out of 5.  "},{"Title":"Good stuff.

There is Ulee's daughter-in-law Helen--whom was responsible for starting the Trojan War in The Illiad. Ulee is a veteran of the Vietnam War in much the way that Odysseus was of the Trojan War. He tells his grand daugher Penny he survived because of his trickery in much the same way Odysseus did with the Trojan Horse. His endurance of the many things which befall him after being sent to retrieve his Helen remind one of the way Odysseus was treated when he returned to his home as a beggar.

It's a pure and modest domestic drama, with a stark, intense reality that gets deep under your skin.  The keeper works diligently, like a bee, to survive, but also approaches the kinks of life in the same assiduous way as he deals with his bees.  This double metaphor provides a sturdy noetic foundation that pays off surprisingly well.  There are depictions of emotional chaos that are genuinely unsettling-you may find some scenes very painful.  Nothing feels overcalculated, so that even the thug scenes do not thrill, but startle you with their authenticity.  Like Nunez's previous film, RUBY IN PARADISE, ULEE'S GOLD records a region's undercurrents with a bombed-out vitality. Peter Fonda is remarkable as the beekeeper (named Ulee, short for Ulysses), both coldly responsible and curiously sensitive; when Nunez concentrates on his craggy, tired face, you sense there are thousands of stories behind every wrinkle.

Instead, like Victor Nunez's last film, RUBY IN PARADISE, it's a movie of quiet grace and dignity, and a character study that studies its main subject and allows the nuance and detail of everyday life to creep in.  The subject here is played by Peter Fonda, the Fonda whose career I've had the least exposure to; I've only seen him in EASY RIDER, and while that film has dated for me, he was good in it.

His visual sense is amazing, this movie, like his previous Ruby in Paradise, is peppered with gorgeous compositions. He also has a knack for getting a lot out of his actors, and bringing some depth and meaning to what otherwise would be fairly generic stories.What a pity it is then that he seems to refuse to get help with the script. It is laudable that he eschews the standard Hollywood formulaic approach (which produces a number of small surprises in the plot) and there is nothing wrong with his quiet, understated approach, but to pull this off requires two things - a strong narrative and engaging dialogue - both of which seem to be well beyond Nunez's capabilities.One of these days Nunez will come up with another interesting story and shoot it beautifully and hire a good writer. The result will be a GREAT film. Until then, for people who enjoyed Ulee's Gold, I might suggest renting another movie with a different story but many other similarities. Running on Empty has a great director in Sidney Lumet and sparkling cast in Christine Lahti, River Phoenix, and Judd Hirsch, in a slow moving, taut, family drama that is worth seeing.P.S.

Peter does not have Henry's fiery blue eyes that displayed an inner fierceness that belied his outward calm so Peter, with his mother's looks and his very laid back personality, has to work harder(without appearing to do so) to have a similar Fonda impact but he did it so well here and better than I thought he could. This role was a perfect fit for him and he was terrific in it, and he is a credit to the great Fonda name as a result. Ulee's Gold might have been a Oscar instead of the honey he made as a bee-keeper(Peter was nominated but did not win).As a reclusive and introverted Viet Nam vet with a painful war disability, an extreme family dysfunction, and a declining but backbreaking bee-keeping business that's rapidly facing extinction, Ulee has a lot of hard work and stress interfering with his taxing efforts to just get by from day to day. When thrown into a deadly family crisis caused by his criminal and convict son, he reluctantly gets deeply involved in trying to solve it and almost gets killed for it.Many viewers may think this film was paced too slow, but most filmmakers trying to portray a rural story set in the South get the pacing all wrong, as city boy filmmakers never understand why Southern folks move slowly and seem to think slowly, thereby appearing stupid and/or lazy, so they try to speed up the story and ruin it by doing so. I was a country boy early on and understand that carefully-paced, oven hot-country behavior very well and was pleased that Ulee's Gold was paced just right, which to me was the critical factor in making this film believable, along with the spot-on acting of the lead characters.Pat Richardson of Home Improvement was terrific as the helpful tenant/eventual love interest, as her character's basic human goodness, calmness, and sweet motherly nature showed again an example of perfect casting, as that is Pat.See this good story with lots of tension and realistic Southern pacing, and great acting in the leads. Plus, very interesting visuals of bee-keeping details made this one of my favorite films set in the South.For other great films set in the South, see The Trip To Bountiful, Places in the Heart, and Sling Blade.

It is a family drama that is intellectual enough to turn in a different direction when you are ready to pounce on it as trite (if you don't know this feeling, watch anything on Lifetime).  Ulee's Gold never states the obvious, and like a French film it lets you piece the story together based on conversations and confrontations.     The story follows the slight Ulee Jackson.  He has been rumored to have been a little radical back in his day.  This is understandable, as he faced battle in Vietnam and lost his wife not long after they started a family.  She took care of him and the family more than it seems he realized.  She kept him in balance and in line and the love must have been extremely strong, because years after her passing he still seems like he hasn't completely come to terms with it.     He works as a beekeeper and tells one of his daughters how the bees and him take care of each other.  Keeping busy with them takes him out of this and other grief.  The bees seem to be a sort of replacement for his wife and they keep him in check.  Even though it seems like he is still dealing with the tragedy, he lives a rather peaceful and serene life in a nice neighborhood and house by a swamp.  Soon, a storm comes.     His imprisoned son calls him out of nowhere one day.  Their relationship was shattered somewhere along the way, and mistakes kept Ulee's love away.  He is desperate with a crisis involving his wife, who is perpetually stung out and hung on drugs.  She is in the custody of dangerous criminals who demand money for a theft gone awry which her husband was involved in and jailed because of.  This large catastrophe falls in Ulee's lap and soon becomes a hazard for the welfare of his family.     Enter the help of the maternal neighbor, Connie Hope, played by Patricia Richardson who escapes her dull image of TV mom (from Home Improvement).  She provides relief and help with this intricate situation, as well as slowly reshaping the man Ulee has become.     Ulee's Gold is as understated as its title character, thanks largely in part to Peter Fonda's beautiful performance.  He brilliantly manages to convey a man's emotions that could boil over and melt him down at any second, but are always kept deep under the surface.        Ulee's Gold is a near-perfect masterpiece of human emotion,  so nimbly directed with atmosphere that it has the feel of what Ulee's mind must be like- fragile, almost dilapidated  and overwhelmed with personal storms.

So said Roger Ebert. That captures the essence of Fonda's performance, which is also the essence of Ulee's Gold. There are those actors of past and present who visibly try to get you to notice them - Alec Baldwin, Robin WIlliams, and Marlon Brando are examples. There are those who do not try, and yet they still attract your attention - Gary Cooper, Steve McQueen, Randolph Scott - because of their charisma in what they say and do, regardless of how seldom they say and do it. Then there is the rarest of all actors - those who seem to be trying to get you to NOT notice them. Then, when their time to shine (their close up, if you will) come along, you not only notice them, but you remember them. The only two actors I have known to do this are Spencer Tracy and Henry Fonda. In Ulee's Gold Peter Fonda shows he too has this ability, even if he seldom gets a chance to use it. In viewing this film, I saw much of Henry in Peter's performance. If you were to view My Darling CLementine you would also see the parallels in Henry's performance - how he calmly subdues a drunkard who is shooting up a saloon, and the easily Peter calmly walks into a nest of agitated bees. And the way both men act when harm threatens their family - they are calm and patient on the outside, but only until it is time to act. Then, they perform acts of cunning and bravery. Most of the time, they don't seem to be doing much at all. But you must still watch them because when they do something, you don't want to miss it. Henry made a number of exceptional films over a 45 year career - many good, but none wildly phenomenal. Peter mad the most influential film of his generation (Easy Rider) while still in his 20s and has not come close to that level since. With Easy Rider, we knew Peter was an icon.

Those were good guys, Penny. It's so sad, she says. You like sad?No, but sometimes inside it makes you quiet.

They have her jacked up on roofies (Rohypnol), held hostage.Jimmy pleads with Ulee to retrieve Helen for purely family-value reasons.

Another dysfunctional family movie. There are elements of this film that lead you to believe it will be something much bigger and much more original than the average dysfunctional family film. For instance, the dynamics of this family are set up in an interesting way. Ulee (Peter Fonda) is the grandfather of the two children he cares for. The parents of these children are criminals. Their father is in jail and their mother ran off and lives with two sleazy men she and her husband used to work with. Ulee realizes he has to bring this family back together so the plot of the film is him bringing his daughter in law home, and then facing the repercussions of this act. The story has the foundation for something incredibly enthralling, but I was personally underwhelmed as I felt that nothing much was achieved through this film and it wasn't really engaging in the slightest.This film lacks any kind of pizazz or real gripping elements. I'm OK with this when the film makes up for it by being either incredibly well made or proves to be a much more clever and complex story. Ulee's Gold is neither of these things. It just kind of leaves you with a sense of lackluster, half entertained dullness. There isn't much to this film, as far as I could tell, and it didn't really grab me emotionally like I felt it tried to do. While it could have really moved me or really intellectually engaged me, it fell short and I see it now as another film that ends up just being there. It's just another film with nothing very special about it to get my attention.But perhaps I'm being too harsh on the films story just for not living up to my expectations. It is an interesting story and it has its moments that can draw you in, but overall I was underwhelmed. Where this film's major issues stem from is just its overall tone. One of my least favorite things is when a film wants to be dramatic and it just tries too hard to be sincere and depressing. In Ulee's Gold I feel as if every character has just woken up at every moment of the film. They are all so bland and so dull that I just want to yell at them, Have some enthusiasm! Wake up! Speak up! The entire film just gives off this unbelievable sense of melodrama with all of the characters acting way too bleak. I understand that they are all in bad situations, and no doubt have a reason to be depressed, but if this monotone attitude could just break for one second I could buy into the drama of this film a little more. But instead the whole film is loaded with unrealistic dialouge that just furthers a one dimensional tone that gets old quickly. There's that split between realistic drama and melodrama. I wouldn't say Ulee's Gold dives head first into the melodrama side, but it certainly leans way too far in that direction for me to consider this emotionally engaging drama.I really wanted to enjoy Ulee's Gold. It had so much going for it and is one of those films that could have been so much better. But try as I might I could only find this film slow, dull, and monotonous. People have revered Peter Fonda's role as Ulee, but I honestly saw nothing in his performance. It fit with the rest of the dreary acting, complete with blank stare and all. I felt nothing while watching this movie, and that includes entertainment. I figure I will forget this movie within a week. Unfortunate, but true.

The medieval alchemists famously attempted to turn lead into gold. As they consciously went through the various steps and stages of refining the metal, they would (theoretically) grow spiritually as their inner development mirrored their outer work. The Gold in the title refers to the honey Ulee manufactures, as well as symbolizing his family, himself, and the highest potential of all of the above. This film succeeds on all levels. Unlike most metaphorical or allegorical films, the narrative is matter-of-fact and grounded in reality. Here archetypal themes are spelled out in a modern context that requires no suspension of disbelief. The alchemical motif is repeated throughout, illustrating the different stages of the process. Ulee and his family heal by working together in the alchemical process of honey production.In a larger context, the entire tale, from Ulee's archetypal descent into to the underworld all the way to the love flowing amidst his restored family, is itself an alchemical working. The viewer gets to experience what the process is like - the challenge, growth, healing, and love, just by watching the film. Ulee's Gold leaves you feeling good.

It refers to the honey produced by bees that have been mucking around in the blossoms of the Florida tupelo trees, which only are in bloom for a few weeks. This makes for a high-end honey.The bees kept by Peter Fonda play a weighty symbolic role in this film. They get along, so why can't we? As we all know, bees are divided into classes. First, there is the queen bee. She's fed royal jelly in her блины. Besides the queen bee, or rather beneath her, are the workers, the drones, the soldiers, the Viscounts, the peons, the serfs, the bishops and rooks, and the châtelaines. There are others, many of mixed race, but you don't need to know all of them to enjoy the movie.I think this role earned Peter Fonda a Golden Globe Award and he deserved it. He's all guardedness and reserve. The death of his wife six years ago has left him emotionally bankrupt. His two grand-daughters don't pay him much attention as he goes about the time-consuming business of schlepping bee hives and barrels around the woodland apiary. His son is in the slams for a robbery. Then, reluctantly, he agrees to his son's desperate plea to Fonda to rescue his daughter-in-law from abject distress in Orlando. When they wouldn't let her into Disneyworld she went spastic and has been strung out and in the hands of two really evil young men ever since.Fonda reluctantly drives to Orlando to take her home. The two miscreants happily hand over the strung out woman, having had their fill of her, but they inform Fonda that they were his son's accomplices and they have reason to believe the son stashed a hoard of money from the robbery. They want the money or else they'll pay a visit to Fonda's family. The daughter-in-law, Christine Dunford, is in awful shape. Her performance is outstanding. Fonda enlists the help of a neighboring woman, a nurse, Patricia Richardson, to put Dunford to bed, restrain her, and keep her sedated.Meanwhile, Fonda's demanding work with the tupelo honey is falling behind schedule. At about this point, the story loses some of its sense of abject despair. With the help of Dunford's two daughters and the sensible next-door nurse, things improve. Dunford regains her identity and her daughters gradually warm to her.It's nicely directed too. Fonda has been fiercely independent since he became a widower. But now, coming home sleepless from work in the field, his back killing him, he leans against the kitchen wall. His daughter-in-law asks if she can fix him something to eat. He replies, A glass of water would be nice. And the director, Victor Nunez, lets us see Dunford turn on the tap, fill the glass with water, hand it to Fonda, and the camera pauses while he drinks the entire contents.The business with the two unsavory robbers continues apace. The dominant of the two, Steven Flynn, does a truly good job of being what he is, carrying around with him a dull glow of foreboding. The director hands him an impressive introduction. Fonda visits the pool hall and Flynn has just made a shot. His eyes follow the pool ball and then slowly rise to stare with a phony smile at Fonda. But he's always polite. Fonda is Mr. Jackson or Sir, even when Flynn is holding a revolver to his ear.It gets more tense as it turns from domestic drama to crime story, which I won't get into except to say that not a shot is fired and no one gets his head wrenched off.Start it and stick with it for a while.

It lacks of a good story !I didn't think the father seem to love the son. If the film can bring them more Love,it could be better ! What a pity ! Waste my time ! "},{"Title":"6 on a scale of 10","Date":"2 January 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I cannot imagine how the average of the first 389 voters gave this an 8.0. Are you people nuts???? This was only as good as a 6 because it didn't have any glaring, miserable problems.However, if you want a movie to put you to sleep, this is it. Within 30 seconds I was commenting to my friend about how slow it was. 112 minutes seemed like an eternity.Also, the plot was very weak. The acting was very marginal. The production values were nearly nonexistent. No name actors, no special effects, no staging. And, the music and sound were weakly done too!The more I think about it, the more I think it probably should have been a 5. It certainly won't make my collection of 1200 movies! And, Peter Fonda for an Oscar??? Give me a break! "}]
