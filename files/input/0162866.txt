These people betray their ignorance. This production went to simply amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story occurred. Courtly manners are something few people outside the court ever see. While the acting may appear highly stylized, it is, in fact, as close a replication as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations as the director could create. The actor's facial expressions are a marvel, particularly the duplicitous Marquis Changxin and the King's mother.There are, of course, reflections of both Greek and Shakespearian tragedy in the relationship between the king, his parents and his love. The juxtaposition of the king transforming from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of an individual's nature. This movie would provide much to ponder in a college course on the humanities.At the same time, it almost rushes along, even in the slowest scenes heading towards an inexorable denouement. One suspects the involvement of large portions of the troop movements, which were quite awesome. It makes The Lord of the Rings battle scenes pale by comparison. Few directors have the ability to literally field thousands of humans on the field of battle just for art's sake. I recall one scene in which at least 30,000 troops can be seen moving across a huge plain. The logistics for such a shot would have been staggering.I could go on... but simply, I can't recommend this film highly enough.

I was very impressed with the novelistic structure of the film. The film, which is in a language I do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance for me. I think this speaks to the film's quality. It was visually stunning. The acting was visually entrancing. The Chinese theater traditions of movement, used to enhance the delivery of dialogue, is so compelling after watching Western film, where actors traditionally focus more heavily on the dialogue. The action in this film comes right at you, without a lot of explosions to get your attention. It is human action that is so affective here. The added advantage that the film taught me history about one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the funereal clay army of China's First Qin Emporer, was very impressive. It seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great ethical themes. This is a film I can comfortably recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.

What makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him.  It reminded me a bit of King Lear and some of the other Shakespeare plays.The king starts out with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives.  He and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by Li Gong, concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king, thus giving him a pretext to go to war.  But while she's away, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree.There are numerous side plots that keep the action going.  There is the Marquis, who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who's really very clever and wants to become king himself.  He fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years.  Then there is the Prime Minister, a political rival to the king, who turns out to really be his father.  The assassin is a complex character himself.  An adept swordsman and killer, he is undergoing a reformation when the king's lover comes to recruit him.  He wants nothing more with killing, but is eventually won over by Li Gong (who wouldn't be?) when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become.Some spectacular cinematography, especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale - like they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally.  The acting is OK, nothing special.  It's the story that's interesting, though at over two and a half hours, it pushes the limit.Definitely worth viewing.

Even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake, it's an astonishing feast for the eyes the scene depicting the coup attempt of the Marquis is one of the most staggering evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory, and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy.

This film was such a marvelous blend of action, intrigue, and personality, and I'm sure I'll see it again and again in years to come.Some of the complaints about the movie have been the golden/brown tint and the quick, disorienting editing.  However, I loved both of these qualities in the movie, though the editing did take some time to get used to.  A great example of it, is when we're introduced to Jing Ke, the assassin.  He is offered an assignment for five thousand, and we see a close up of his face as he demands ten thousand.  The next shot shows him with sword drawn, in the house of his victims.  That whole introduction to the assassin was marvelously edited, in my opinion.  You have to realize that in order to fit the epic plot into just under three hours, a lot of tiny details needed to be cut out.  The quick editing also makes the movie seem much shorter than it really is.Someone said that the swordfighting in the movie (what little of it there was) seemed like high school drama, but I strongly disagree.  Most of the action is captured in a few shots, making it seem much more realistic.  In so many american films, we see a a flash of a dozen close ups, without getting a feel for what is even happening!  Also, the constant use of slow motion in many movies gets so old.  By having the fighting in this movie fast and furious, it is much more affecting.I won't give away the ending, but it was really suspenseful and surprising. I had no idea what would happen (being unfamiliar with Chinese history helped), and was on the edge of my seat!   So, to conclude, if you like sweeping historical epics, make sure to see this!  I really like the films of Kurosawa, and saw some similarities here, so also if you like his movies, see this!!

No, it's not Mel Gibson in Braveheart, but then, it's not trying to be. Actually, The Emperor and the Assassin probably has (thankfully) more in common with a Shakespearean production than a Hollywood blockbuster.In the third century BC, the King of Qin is attempting to unite (in other words conquer) the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to invade the Kingdom of Yan.This is where the Lady Zhao comes in. She and the King have been friends since childhood. They are obviously very much in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. Together they devise a plot. She will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the King and escape to Yan. Once there she will convince the Prince of Yan to send an assassin back to kill the King. When the assassination fails, the King will have his excuse to invade Yan.Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend's ruthlessness, she begins to wonder if the King may need to be assassinated for real.One sure sign that you're not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the King and the assassin. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that could truly go either way.This is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. Most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as the Lady Zhao. I grow more and more convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world.I must say, however, that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film.

But then the Chinese, who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again, would never tolerate it otherwise. The attention to detail is wonderful, especially for anyone who has read Sima Qian's account in the Records of the Historian. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, did indeed make an attempt on Qin Shi Huang's life at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both the head of General Fan and the dagger rolled up into the map, as well as the dagger being thrown into the brass column. Although Jing Ke is described as no stranger to swordplay, he's hardly the invincible warrior portrayed by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is indeed this film's weakest link. In reality (again, according to Sima Qian), he was a heavy drinker and put off his visit to Qin for as long as possible, spending a good deal of time with the ladies of Yan before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way. He was, in short, a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it. Chen Kaige's Jing Ke is afraid of death, but not his own. He is the classic ruthless killer turned disillusioned pacifist. His love (or maybe just affection) for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom Zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians claimed Qin Shi Huang did this, although there is a legend about him burying 460 Confucians up to their necks and then beheading them)is enough to make this former assassin kill again. The melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring. The acting here isn't shabby, though not very interesting given the character. As for Lady Zhou, in all the numerous stories I've heard about Qin Shi Huang, she's never come up. Anyway, Gong Li is famous enough for Americans to have heard of her (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and there needed to be a love interest, so here she is. It's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as Jing Ke's character. She's done much better (in Qiu Ju for example) at being subtle; here she just barely manages presence. But all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of Li Xuejian as Zheng himself. Qin Shi Huang is for the Chinese rather what Milton's Satan is for us accepted as a villain, but a noble one. Qin Shi Huang's accomplishments radiate an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and Li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. Li's performance is enough, but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is purposely drab. It does feel ancient. The score is adequate, scarcely moving though very appropriate to the action. Though I've only seen it once, I believe that Chen Kaige should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him. The opening credits are exhilarating. If five stars its absolutely average, I given three more for Li Xuejian's acting and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer, and director.

An intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast. King Qin's simple wish for a unified Empire for his common people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, plots and counter plots and oh yes, bodies. Lots of bodies. This epic story of China's beginnings is a great way for Westerners to glimpse little known Asian history. Emperor Qin's legacies include the thousands of life-size terra-cotta figures which are still being excavated today. As an historical person, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin should be regarded along with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, to name a few of the world's greatest conquerors/statesmen.

Both films concentrate on the first unification of China by the ruthless and troubled King of Qin and feature a conspicuous branding of a female lead. But whereas Emperor's Shadow gives the whole process an obsessive gravitas, despite Kaige Chen's best efforts (and he manages some beautiful looking compositions) the present production is more diffuse and, to me anyway, was on a different level. The earlier film is more powerful (there is nothing as striking as the Tarkovsky-like 'sacrifice of the bells' moment, which is at the start of Qin Song, for instance) even though Kaige Chen has the full advantage of some marvellous locations. The portrait of the Qin King is also less impressive here. Fengyi Zhan simply has far less of a cruel, regal presence in the role than does Wen Jiang, and there is nothing like the overpowering relationship between the Emperor-to-be and his 'soulmate' - be it assassin or musician - that exists in the earlier work holding the long narrative together. Having said that, there is much well mounted angst and drama as the king inevitably exploits many of him around him, some grand battle scenes, and a lot else to enjoy. I would also add Musa to the list of worth-seeing Asian epics which are currently available on cheap import DVDs. This current title has the best picture with none of the occasionally distracting compression problems of the the others (the film is on a 2 sided disk).

The movie evoked for me images and ideas from Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, and Freud.The story itself is true (I checked it out at britannica.com!), so this film will appeal to history buffs.  It's ironic that Q'in spent much of his last years in a futile quest for immortality (not shown on the screen, but consistent with the plot).The movie can also be viewed as an allegory of Maoism and the Cultural Revolution.

Assassin Jingke stab emperor Qin is a well know story that nearly every Chinese know it so well. Assassin Jingke was considered a biggest hero in the history for his great sacrifice spirit and the brave suicide assassination, although his action was failed. Zhang Fengyi is one of my favorite actor (I like his performance in Farewell my concubine), his assassin Jinke is silent and full of passion in the heart, that is convincing.

I can not understand why Chen decides to make this most tyranny emperor in the Chinese history always crying. The most attractive role in the movie is Marquis Changxin, he married Qin's mother and most time he looks like idiot but actually he has his own ambitious plan. Marquis Changxin is convincingly played by Wang Zhiwen, I like him so much.The movie do have some memorable moments, one is Jingke took a assignment to kill the whole family of ironsmith, but when he facing the angelic blind daughter of ironsmith, he cannot do his job.

Indeed, the running joke at the time was that Chen Kaige thought The Emperor's Shadow only flopped because he didn't direct it.China seems to have the same attitude to its First Emperor (Li Xuejian) as France does to Napoleon, alternating between admiration for the best of his achievements and condemnation for the methods he used to pursue them, and the film does at least embrace these contradictions in its portrait of an often childish but visionary Emperor wanting to end 550 years of hell and unite all of China under one benevolent ruler through increasingly ruthless means. Unlike previous versions of the story, here he even plans to manipulate a rival kingdom into sending an assassin (Jing Ke) to kill him to give him an excuse to invade, despatching his childhood love (Gong Li) as agent provocateur to arrange it only for her to find her sympathies shifting as the Emperor becomes increasingly merciless&#133; Less political than Shadow (though the film was heavily cut by the Chinese censors) and more down to Earth than Hero (the visual palette is much more subdued, favoring earth tones over vivid colors), despite the huge budget, Kaige doesn't really have a feel for spectacle and it's not exactly directed with a surfeit of imagination the battle scenes are often more functional than inspired despite their scale while the massive sets are rarely employed to their best advantage. Nor is the film's structure always helpful divided into various chapters of varying degrees of success, it sometimes lends the film a disjointed feel. As a result it's a film that tends to work in fits and starts rather than feeling like a completely successful film, with sideline characters like Kaige's Prime Minister or Wang Ziwen's Marquis constantly playing the fool to avoid being seen as a threat often far more vivid than the central trio.

The story follows a ruthless, cold-blooded emperor who will do anything to reach up to the highest level of rulership, a reformed and moral assassin, and the emperor's wife, who bring those two forces together. Though running at a length of 161 minutes, the film cruises by very fast, with realistic battle scenes, almost exactly like Ran and long, sprawling, unforgettable shots like Lawrence of Arabia, extremely good performances all around, and a complexed, but fully revealing storyline.

On one hand the technical aspects of the film is quite good, excellent in fact, especially considering the budget (it was the most expensive Chinese film ever made in its time). On the other hand the film strikes one as being overlong, bloated, stuffed with its own importance and muddled in its examination of history. Not to mention the mannerist (to borrow an adjective from British critic Tony Rayns) acting and the demented portrayal of Qin Shi Huang by the lead actor, Li Xuejian. Sadly, Li seems not to know where his performance is heading. Every other actor, including Zhang Fengyi, Wang Zhiwen and the gorgeous Gong Li, seems to be like mannequins attached on a string and jerked about by director Chen Kaige.It astounded me 12 years ago to see this movie, because Chen had a very high reputation then (he won the Palme d'Or for Farewell My Concubine and helmed two of the best Chinese movies ever made, Yellow Earth and King of Children). I found it then boring and unconvincing, with no new slant to common historiography. In fact, most of the actors seem to be acting in a mannerist theater which makes some of the performances insufferable. I revisited the movie 10 years later, only to find my earlier assessment holds.I was only convinced I was right after watching Chen Kaige's The Promise. It seems that Chen has come to a point he is merely making a movie for the sake of doing one - and that he no longer has anything important or refreshing to say. Looking back, I would say the downward trend really started in The Emperor and the Assassin. My 5 stars is for the technical aspects only, not for the directing or the performances.

In fact, as the polity that he founded now encompasses 1/6 of humanity and will in time regain at least some of the powerful presence it still had just 200 years ago, Ying Zheng/Qin Shihuang can be said to impinge more directly on our contemporary lives than those colossi of far western Eurasian history, perhaps as much as someone much closer to our time like Philip II of Spain or Napoleon Bonaparte.Chen Kaige has done justice to the First Emperor and to the world which created him and which he in turn shaped.  Of the world of 3rd century B.C.E. China, of the period known succinctly as the era of the Warring States, he offers us a faithful reconstruction, wonderful and full of marvels.The film is a great antidote to the tendency of Westerners to view China as changeless.  For those whose images of China are based on films like The Last Emperor or even Marco Polo, the world of the First Emperor will come as a revelation, so utterly different is it.  For those accustomed to seeing the artwork of the period, the film will satisfy the longing of their imagination's eye to see what all those isolated artifacts (bronzes, bamboo scrolls, murals, and above all the haute couture) might have looked like in their proper context.Far more valuable, however, than the reconstruction of material life is the evocation of the mental universe of the time.  This movie does not serve up any easy black-and-white caricatures which could give succor and solace to contemporary ideologues of whatever persuasion.  Both the Qin king and his enemies, the rulers of the other kingdoms, are portrayed as championing a morally justifiable cause  the latter the preservation of their individual countries' independence and their proud ancestral traditions (with a fanaticism which reminds one of WWI Europe) and the former the unification of the known world to bring peace and prosperity to the common people of whatever fatherland (again reminiscent of 20th century global politics). The drama turns on the eternal and universal  question of whether the ends justify the means, depicting this in the shift in the major characters' loyalties away from a leader whose mounting cruelties render his declared noble aims emptier and emptier.Now we come to the treasure of the film which is accessible to all viewers, not merely Chinese ones or those whom history as history can engage. Ying Zheng's cruelties are put in the context not merely of a fable about the excesses of absolute power but of an account of the vagaries of specific human lives -- that of the king of Qin himself but also of his lady and of his assassin. Ying Zheng's, at least, are founded on the historical tradition (meaning historiography worthy of Tacitus but also gossip worthy of Suetonius).  He is shown as having a troubled childhood, a hostage in a foreign country and even, in a sense, orphaned.  This past haunts him as surely as do the shades of the Qin royal ancestors, speaking through the figure of a Master of Rites who presents the paradox of a  youthful face and an austere, unbending voice, a clever device evoking timelessness and stressing the irrevocability of duty.In visual terms, the movie reminds one of Kurosawa's Ran with its court ceremonial and battle scenes (and of his Hidden Fortress with its glimpses of the life of commoners).  It does lack the dramatic tightness of Ran, but after all Emperor is not an adaptation of a play of genius but rather a staging of a synthesis of disparate chapters from Sima Qian's 2nd century B.C.E. classic, The Records of the Historian.  The film bears better comparison with another glorious film, however imperfect Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.Some of the sense of dramatic incoherence comes directly from the fact that one has to be Chinese and steeped in Chinese lore or a foreigner versed in that history to appreciate the seeming detours the plot is taking.  I myself had gotten fuzzy enough on the history to wonder why a certain plotline was given as much attention as it was, but then I heard one line of dialogue which obliquely reminded me of one crucial fact (or rumor become legend), and the point of an entire sequence of scenes came to me.  Viewers who do not know the history, however, will still get the same point after watching the subplot to its end.Despite the fact that certain scenes (fittingly palace scenes) are done in the stilted manner of Chinese opera dialogue (which style can be enjoyed, of course, in its own terms), the language was overall straightforward.  I can say this as a person whose Mandarin has gotten rusty but who can still match up 80% of the heard dialogue to the subtitles.  Much is lost in translation naturally but also some things might even have been corrected for instance, the Mandarin word guojia which could sound to modern Chinese ears in its modern sense of nation is translated as empire which might more clearly reflect the way Qin Shihuang may have meant it (if indeed he actually ever used that particular word).  The various solutions for translating the key word Tianxia, meaning both the known human world and supreme political power are, however, less felicitous.  The subtitles may in fact contribute to a more accurate historical reconstruction at the cost of obscuring a message about nationalism aimed at a contemporary Chinese audience (what message that might be is a debate in itself!).The Emperor and the Assassin is high ENTERTAINMENT, which is to say it is a true EDUCATION.  See it.

Artifice that doesn't acknowledge itself stands in our way. But I let myself be taken in by anything that comes across my eyes, believing no thing to be better in itself than others and that they all have potential.Here the thread that takes me in is that it involves China in a defining period, the unification under the Qin. It was an important time, more pertinently for me as the time that gave rise to to different schools of thought, practices of seeing and making sense of the world, some of which I treasure and they ended up forging Chinese soul forever. In a significant way the China we know was first created in this time.None of that is particularly mined here so on that count I leave empty handed. I get the saga, the lavish scope, the camera that cleanly sweeps over crowds or across imperial rooms. Sporadic battles and the tangled knots of ironic fate. In pace, sweep and intricacy, it's fine work. Some viewers thought of Gladiator, what I saw here is a kinship to Kurosawa's Shakespearean work and Japanese jidaigeki. Zhang would portray the same period and king in Hero, this is the earthier version.The one thing I found particularly noteworthy is the plot that revolves around the lovely Gong Li. Simply seeing her is an occasion for me and the other reason I'm here, the way she holds herself with aloof grace. I have made it a point to see her in most things.The story around her tantalizes; she has been sent by her husband king to a rival kingdom, her actual mission is to find and inspire an assassin of her husband that will give him the pretext for invasion. The life she comes to share with the scarred assassin (in Japanese films he would have been a scruffy ronin), hinting at genuine romance, while we are aware of duplicity and illusion, the agency it carries from the machinations to forge a world.

The film is very atmospheric, the extremely mannered and polite courtly ceremony and ritual contrasted with sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces. Battle scenes are rare and short, the focus is on the battle within the individual on what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means. The emperor's journey from idealistic peacemaker to ruthless tyrant is aiming to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into the motivation of the Emperor, indeed his actions and aims do not really change throughout, only Gong Li's attitudes to him are altered. The most interesting performances are Gong Li's and the titular Assassin as they reassess when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China at the time, the Emperor and the Assassin does not rely on hysteric emotion or big battles, but rather a brooding atmosphere of menace and inevitability.

Suspense is properly maintained and actors are upto the task.

"},{"Title":"The message of Hero","Date":"24 May 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" Director Zhang Yimou's Hero is playing around the country to widespread critical acclaim. It is undoubtedly one of the most visually beautiful movies of our time. However, American audiences may not fully appreciate what message comes wrapped in this beautiful package.Hero rewrites history's judgment on the movie's central figure, the Emperor Qin &#150; a ruthless leader who unified China through the most brutal means &#150; by depicting him as a tough but benevolent and misunderstood monarch, in the process also changing the story of the failed assassination attempt on him as well.The historical Emperor Qin was known for his cruelty. The movie does refer to his practice of slaughtering entire villages. It is silent about the tortures he employed, the draconian legal code that involved the cutting off of limbs, his burning of books and suppression of schools of thought, or such incidents as the burying alive of hundreds of scholars who had objected to his rule.The reason for the differences between the historical Emperor Qin and the movie's retelling may be found in the needs of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Even before unifying China, the then-King of Qin was hated and feared by both rivals and subjects alike. The neighboring state of Yan (replaced with Zhao in the movie) knew that the state of Qin aimed eventually to attack. Officials in the Yan kingdom hired an assassin to kill the King of Qin and help them escape imminent defeat. Jing Ke, the man selected for the job, had to find a method to bring himself close to the King to complete his mission. Pan Yuqi was a disgruntled Qin official who had fled to the state of Yan to escape from the King of Qin's tyrannical rule. He so hated the King of Qin that he offered to allow himself to be killed in order that Jing could gain access by bringing his head to the despot. Jing killed him and brought both Pan's head and a map of the state of Yan that the king coveted, hiding in it a dagger with which to assassinate the tyrant.The King of Qin indeed allowed Jing Ke in his presence, and as the king opened the map offered to him, the assassin deftly procured the knife hidden in the map scroll. Unfortunately, Jing's initial thrust was not strong enough, grazing but not wounding the king. The king was then able to unsheathe his sword and parry any of Jing's successive thrusts. The assassin had no choice but to hurl his weapon at the monarch, but missed. He was later executed.In Hero, the assassin (played by Jet Li) has the opportunity and the skill to dispatch the King, yet decides against it. After abandoning his decision to kill the king, he is executed, and then buried as a hero.The Jet Li character is called Nameless. Nameless chooses loyalty, and his own death, after a long conversation with the King of Qin. The king asserts that Nameless's quest is only negative, he acts out of hatred and revenge. He reveals that he himself is misunderstood, that the king's strength is used for the sake of unifying a great Chinese nation, a nation that will comprise everything under heaven (this crucial phrase was translated in English as our land).Like the Emperor Qin, Mao Zedong, upon winning the civil war against Chiang Kai Sheik, unified China. Mao was an open admirer of the Qin Emperor. This often-hated emperor came to be seen as a symbol for the Communist Party.Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, the Chinese Communist Party has used China's state controlled media to make the claim that the Communist Party exists for the sake of a great and unified China. Love of China and love of the Party are conflated, and love of China is taught to be of supreme importance.Zhang's movie fits the CCP script very neatly. It appropriates China's history, its founding moment, the unification by the Emperor Qin, and uses that history to teach the very same lessons that CCP has taught the need to give up individual claims (what we today call rights) for the sake of a great and powerful China under the rule of a strong leader (the CCP).The leaders of the CCP wish the viewers of the movie to forget some other parallels with the Emperor of Qin. Similar to the Qin Emperor, the People's Republic of China is one of the most brutal and reviled governments in the world. Just as the Emperor of Qin suppressed Confucianism and persecuted those who objected to his rule, the CCP persecutes and tortures all of those with views and beliefs differing from the Party, including Falun Gong practitioners, house Christians, Uigher Muslims, union organizers, and democracy activists.

He founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the Han dynasty that permanently defined Chinese civilization ever since.Chin (or the King of Zheng as he was known before he founded the empire)was roughly contemporaneous with Scipio, Hannibal, and Fabius in the West. The parallel Roman world dominance (West and East worlds) was achieved without a single towering personality like Chin. It would not be for another century before the West produced Caesar - the nearest comparable Western figure.Chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot. History only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning  leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film.

The main resource of China is said to be its huge mass of people, a currency which consumes itself in the pursuit of its leaders' goals, in this case the unification of China into an empire in the third century BC. I liked it for the history lesson, the ancient architecture (apparently intact after 2229 years) and the gigantic battle scenes, but I suspect that the film has an ulterior purpose in choosing this topic that the Chinese government is drawing an historical example to defend its current policy of unification, particularly in Tibet, by resettling people and by erasing their ethnic and cultural identities. Arguing morality with statistics, one might say.The portrayal of the strong, surprisingly authoritative female lead was an interesting contrast to our usual supposition about Asian women as abused and suppressed, so some of the apparent propaganda may be intended to have a beneficial impact on the Chinese people's self image, not to mention foreign relations.I didn't like the yellow overcast on most of the scenes apparently the same thing Coppola did in Godfather I and II (also in that shabby sequel called Godfather III but that's no great loss) to suggest we're looking at the past.

This film is overlong and ultimately tedious. Gong Li delivers a wonderful performance, as always. And some of the battle scenes are original and breathtaking. The actor who plays the Marquis is also riveting, and the film holds your interest during his part of the film. But after a while the film feels like a lecture on what tragedies are committed in the name of noble causes. And the Shakespearian intensity feels forced and pedantic. For a much more cinematic treatment of the same period, see The Emperor's Shadow. And, of course, Ran.

The acting was not bad and the story still fits, but the character is definitely unnecessary for that eliminating her would not effect the movie.

While the sets and costuming were magnificent, I found the movie overall to be too ambitious, and lacking in narrative cohesion.I may well have been at a disadvantage because I am an American.  The story of the first emporer to unify China is one that is steeped in Chinese tradition, with myriad stories and legends that I assume are well-known in that country.  It is the equivalent of producing an epic picture about Jesus in the U.S.--we know the story, and all the bits that must go into it.  We wouldn't notice a bit of choppiness because our own cultural knowledge fills in the gaps.  Therefore, while this film may be wonderful re-telling of a legend to Chinese audiences, those outside China may be at a loss.High points Xuejian Li and Fengyi Zhang give masterful performances as the King of Qin and the Assassin Jing Ke.  As mentioned above, the sets and costuming, and especially the hairdressing, are outstanding.Low points The movie cannot decide if it is a modern production or an opera, which leads to forced performances.  While I don't speak Mandarin, I have a sneaking suspicion the subtitles did not do justice to the dialog. The editing had more cuts than I have seen in any film that wasn't a student project.  Finally, it was just plain too long, and too much.

I love Chinese movies, know a fair bit about Chinese history, and I'd seen the trailer, which looked simply glorious. Yet somehow the film failed to deliver, and I left the cinema feeling that Chen Kaige should be sent back to film school. Allow me to explain why...First of all, the dialogues are awful. Chinese people have a tendency to answer simple, personal questions with pseudo-philosophical generalizations about the state of the world, and in Chen Kaige's films this habit takes on worrisome proportions. In 'The Emperor and the Assassin' the rhetoric is such that it distracts from the story rather than enrich it. It's as if someone forgot to tell Chen that dialogue is supposed to illustrate things, not to make them more obscure! I had a quick look at my non-Chinese-speaking fellow cinema-goers every now and then, and the look on their faces told me they had no idea what was going on. I, who do speak Chinese, didn't fare much better. To be sure, I could grasp the main plot line (ambitious king allows his wife to help his enemy hire an assassin to murder him, so that he has an excuse to attack the enemy's kingdom, and she falls in love with him), but even so I had the feeling about half of the story was escaping me. Surely that wasn't Chen's intention...Secondly, Chen should have infused some warmth into the film. I'm not at all into American-style honey-let-me-give-you-a-hug-type characterization, but a bit of that wouldn't have gone amiss in this remarkably cold, sterile film. As it is, one spends nearly three hours hours watching a bunch of psychos who may have redeeming features but for whom one somehow doesn't care. This is NOT the actors' fault. As other reviewers have noted, the acting is top-notch - truly first-rate. Rather, it's the director and the screenwriter's fault. It's hard to root for characters who are given such unintelligible dialogues...Last but not least, the cuts. A previous reviewer mentioned that the cuts in this film are rather distracting. I would go so far as to say they're the worst cuts I've ever seen. I can see Chen's need to cut his long story short (it really is too long!), but what's the use of hiring a brilliant cinematographer like Zhao Fei if you're going to ruin his work in the cutting room? Better planning/story-boarding would have prevented this, and would have made 'The Emperor and the Assassin' the visual feast the trailer promised it would be.Mind you, the above is not to say that 'The Emperor and the Assassin' is a bad film. On the contrary, it's a well-acted epic with some amazing set pieces and some even more impressive photography, albeit with nasty cuts. Even at its most pretentious and sterile worst 'The Emperor and the Assassin' is preferable to much of the excrement Hollywood has produced in the past few years. It just could have been so much better, so much more enthralling. Chen Kaige really ought to go back to film school and learn how to tell a story again. Either that, or he should talk to his old partner-in-crime Zhang Yimou, who knows how to tell a story AND how to do justice to Zhao Fei's camera work. I relish the thought of what Zhang would have done with this story...

To get the positive out of the way, the sets are beautiful, the photography is good, and Gong Li is a wonderful actress.  Most everything else, from characterization to narrative to the other performances to the lackluster direction, is below standards.  The film's weak commentary on modern China and its supposedly parallel efforts to unite the Chinese world is stupid and insulting.  The film has been compared to Ran, but a careful watching of the films would reveal that where Kurosawa knew exactly what he was doing with his camera, his actors, and his dialogue, Chien is lost nearly all of the time.  I am sure that the English subtitles did not do justice to the dialogue for no screenwriter would put such cliches on the screen.  I promise...I promise  I promise to never watch the movie again.

The battle scenes were some of the most compelling and interesting that I've ever seen, but the show simply really dragged. Emotional scenes were way too long, and should have been trimmed. And the film deserved so much more in terms of the close-up special effects; when people are stabbed or thrust into by a sword, it looks like a high school drama lesson gone awry. Totally cheesy. Nevertheless, if you are a film student and want to see how to put big scenes together (assuming you get a $100,000,000 budget for your film), check this out (assuming you have 3 long hours to spend on something.) This film could have been better if I spoke Chinese, but I doubt it. "},{"Title":"Sleep-Inducing Fare.

And I went along to view it with a fair measure of reluctance and scepticism after reading the reviews on IMDb, which in the main, tended to be critical if not somewhat scathing. However, being an ethnic Chinese I went - against my better judgement. Anything has to be more inspiring than the formulaic dreck dished up to us by Hollywood Spielberg et al. If I had known what to expect, I would've gone to the theatre better prepared. Regretably, I neglected to bring a big fluffy pillow, a warm blanket, a thermos of milk chocolate drink and a pair of slippers. Being seated in a fully reclineable chair would have been appreciated also.Yes! The film is overlong; the scripting is insipid and lifeless; the plot convoluted and confusing; and the acting wavers between comedic and over-wrought.Want better entertainment? Watch paint dry.

Hard to believe Zhang Yimou made this movie !- I watched it on a french version with awful voices, which certainly didn't help.Of course there's Gong li and some few great historical scenes with thousands of soldiers.

I won't comment as to whether this was a way to add dynamics to the story, or just a sloppy way to extend the running time from a minimal plot, but it definitely won't work unless the viewer is thoroughly absorbed into the story and has the required patience. Your patience will really depend on interest and perhaps understanding of the characters.  In 3rd century B.C., China, an emperor, who appears to suffer from a severe case of bipolar disorder, wants to conquer the last kingdoms so he could form an empire. The princess (played by Gong Li, the only recognizable actress in the film) has a secret relationship with a prince of one of those kingdoms. The story doesn't resume it's regular pace until we're introduced to a town outcast and swordsman, and that's when the viewer gets a whiff of ancient Chinese torture devices (including a head-crushing pendulum - lovely!), an unclear betrayal, and the disgruntled emperor ultimately loses his mind.  I noticed some below compared this movie to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The two really have no relation other than the fact they're both Asian and take place  300-3000 years ago. I was pretty disappointed with CTHD, but I'll admit despite the generic story and familiar riffs it did keep my interest and have something going for it enough to warrant conversation with yaysayers. The Emperor and the Assassin is simply a half-hour soap opera cut into three hours with some good painted sets and fancy costumes.  If you want good folklore, rent the Toshiro Mifune Samurai Trilogy, parts 1, 2, and 3. (But find the DVD version, if it is available in that format.) "}]
