Most of the reviewers here, at IMDB, have made the movie sound dreadful.  I found it hard to believe that anything with Sean Penn and Kristin Scott Thomas would be awful and had to check out the film for myself.  My conclusion -- it is quite good, engaging, and definitely worth watching.The lead actors as well as most of the supporting cast are rather wonderful. Though, I wish that someone slightly more dashing and not so limp played the role of the Austrian student, even if the stumbling manner and sudden onset of neurosis are required of the part.  The scenery is inviting; the sets are great; the variety of accents is interesting; some of the extras are a bit shaky.  The film is not so much about the setting, the era, or the social/political/economic spheres, though all of these have a firm bearing on the events and characters.  It is chiefly about human actions under pressure of circumstances, about relationships, flights of fancy, slip-ups, weaknesses, trust and emotional maneuvering.  Up at the Villa addresses these topics as good as any other period film.I recommend this movie to those who, like I, enjoyed more than one of the followingThe Talented Mr. RipleyGosford ParkHowards EndCountry LifeThe Wings of the DoveA Room with a ViewThe Remains of the Day "},{"Title":"Beautifully filmed, frustrating story of head vs. lust","Date":"2 July 2002","Score":"14 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I'm intrigued by the comment below about how rich Maugham's story is - because I quite like Maugham. I also like Anne Bancroft, Kristen Scott-Thomas and James Fox, so selecting this movie from my video rental store was easy. Unfortunately, something must have happened in writing the screenplay.*** SPOILERS ***One of the more selfless and realistically portrayed acts of love I've ever seen takes place toward the end of this movie. James Fox's character reveals how very difficult and long a climb it has been to now be about to be appointed Governor of Bengal, one of the largest of India's states. With his sigh, his body movement, we sense the dedication, the diligence, the very effort it has taken to climb the greasy pole. Fox is not a peer - we sense no great hereditary estate. He has been knighted for his painstaking work and is apparently wealthy through his very industry.Fox is promptly informed by a poor widow to whom he has proposed, that during the very weekend she was to consider his proposal a) her view of charity was to sleep with a refugee (I thought I'd do him good -he was just so miserable is the amazing explanation), b) the refugee proceeded to kill himself with the gun Fox had lent her for protection, c) the widow arranged to hide the body in the woods with the assistance of a cad who despises Fox, d) Fox's gun and the cad were held by the police, but e) the widow managed to retrieve his gun and the cad by rifling through her friend's desk for material to blackmail the authorities. She tells Fox that she can understand if he would like to withdraw his proposal. Fox's reaction? Not only does he remain keen on marriage with her, but he would freely give up his career in doing so because he loves more than life, and the scandal (if revealed while he were Governor) of his wife's witless fornication causing a stranger's suicide would make the British government's task in India more difficult. To Fox's astonishing act of love, forgiveness and self-abnegation, the widow says she has never loved Fox, that his attitude is weak because they need him in India (one suspects she simply wishes to be the Governor's wife at that moment), that he misunderstands the cad who would never breathe a word of the scandal, and that she turns down his marriage proposal because the scandal has caused her somehow to become a woman of the world, rather than the child (you're used to giving me sweets) who wanted to marry him.However, as the widow, Scott-Thomas had seemed anything but a child. She had spoken before about the horror of marriage to one without virtue - about the twelve year long marriage she had endured in which her husband had gambled and drunk away their money, whored his way through countless women, and finally been killed while speeding. She had spoken of her dread of continuing to live on the generosity of strangers. These aren't a child's sentiments but an adult's sagacity.To whom then does Scott-Thomas turn after the selflessness of Fox's love? To whom does she turn to avoid the insecurity of which she spoke as the bane of her previous marriage? To a married man who says he can offer no guarantees of his love or faithfulness except that he will not return to his wife, who asks her to simply take the train to anywhere, and about whom we know only that he takes waitresses and servants frequently to bed, is disliked by the authorities, and assisted her to deceive the authorities to help her.At the end, she says to the cad, I was yours when you first sat down. Well, welcome to misery. Sorry, I know it's the movies, but when a movie ends this badly, with  the heroine choosing the charmless married void in lieu of the paragon of sacrificial love, security and virtue, I have a difficult time liking the movie. I found Sean Penn's character anything but likeable - he had a sort of neutered quality - making puerile fraternity boy jokes about sleeping with the 60+ old princess, asking why of a government official's decision in a crowded antechamber and shrugging weakly before sitting down (when asked if satisfied with the official's bogus explanation). I suspect the movie has taken the story's tragic ending and tried to torture it into a happy one. The same woman who presumably acted on impulse by marrying a weak man and suffered a disastrous marriage for it,the same woman who acted on impulse to seduce a poor refugee and thereby set in train the events that killed him, is indeed the woman who turns away from a man willing to throw away everything for which he worked out of love for her, for a man who says hey, no guarantees, babe. Tragedy will undoubtedly again ensue - the little painted grin painted on the protagonist as she heads toward the bar car, can't mask it.*** SPOILERS END ***I disliked the movie.

I've tried to catch as many movies with her as possible since then, but she's just never been as good, not even in The English Patient. Much of her material has been extremely dull, incl. Random Hearts and yes, this one, Up At the Villa. The premise of this movie isn't bad, but for some reason it fails to create that engrossing magic that makes all the difference. Kristin's character is too timid and irrational (except for in the end). Jeremy Davies as the poor refugee is not exactly bad, but there's still something totally wrong with his role.Bancroft is flawless, but can't save the movie. Sean Penn is actually good. I don't like most of his roles in other movies - never have -, but he played a different, more complex and realistic yet rogue-ish character here than the hysterical ones he usually embraces (for God knows what reason), and I thought this actually worked. Still, his and Kristin's characters were just too different to make their romantic tension really believable.I will give the movie credit for its entire political dimension, though, which wasn't in the original book that this movie is based on. It's rare to see this; in most cases it's the film that leaves out the book's political content.I rate this movie a 5 out of 10.

One of the advantages f DVD and of On Demand television viewing schedules is that we are offered a second, less than prejudiced look at a film that holds up rather well with age. W. Somerset Maugham's story is adapted for the screen by Belinda Haas and directed by Philip Hass and t proves to be a rather credible tale of the British and American outlooks on love and life all in the setting of pre-WW II Italy. There are flaws in the film, but it is the opportunity to see the radiant Kristin Scott Thomas deliver a role with such understated and quiet dignity (she now is playing in French films as well) that makes the re-visit worthwhile.Mary (Scott Thomas) is a penniless well bred woman who has a brief assignation with an Austrian immigrant Karl Richter (Jeremy Davies) that ends in a tragic death. At present Mary is living in a villa in Florence, Italy, the intended of the wealthy Sir Edgar Swift (James Fox) who despite being older than Mary and less ardent in his association with her (he is close to being assigned the Governor of Bengal), offers her a future of ease and means. Mary is counseled by Princess San Ferdinando (Anne Bancroft) to proceed with the planned marriage, but Mary meets American playboy Rowley Flint (Sean Penn) and begins to challenge her own concepts of the forces of physical attraction and independence against those of promised luxury. A bit of intrigue enters to muddy the waters, and all characters become involved in an Italian scandal that represents the tenor of the times Mary has the good fortune to discover some documents that not only free her from accusations but brings down the Italian officials as well. If this all sounds a bit confusing then it should be noted that the story (and film) are more about human actions under pressure of circumstances, about relationships, flights of fancy, slip-ups, weaknesses, trust and emotional maneuvering than a simple straightforward Italian/British/American tale.The cast is varied - Bancroft gives one of her signature performances, Sean Penn seems out of his element - but the beauty and skill of Kristin Scott Thomas make the film worth savoring.

In a way the film serves as something of a companion period piece to the recent 'Tea With Mussolini' since both films involve wealthy American expatriates living and flourishing in Italy in the days leading up to the Second World War. Thomas stars as Mary, a young British widow who, while she is occupying a Florentine villa, finds herself the object of romantic overtures by an assortment of men including a wealthy but married American man, Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), and a penniless Viennese refuge (Jeremy Davies) with whom she has a one night stand. Shattered by her rejection of him the next night, the latter commits suicide in front of the distraught woman and it is in the attempt to cover up the incident with the help of Rowley that the film's few moments of genuine drama can be found. One of the problems with the story, based on a Somerset Maugham novella, is that, although Mary comes across as a sympathetic and often even a complex character at times &#150; she is a caring, well-intentioned woman whose pampered existence leaves her unsuited for confronting the harshness of much of the world around her - the men whom she involves herself with emerge as both incredible and shallow. Penn seems particularly miscast in a role that calls for debonair subtlety when all he seems to be able to provide is insipid callowness. Indeed, rarely has a pair of screen lovers conveyed less dynamic chemistry than this one does here. Anne Bancroft provides dramatic intensity in her stereotypical role of the aging grand dame, but unfortunately, she doesn't get the screen time one would have liked seen accorded either her or her character. The film is indeed stunning to look at, filled with views of beautiful Florentine architecture and the lush Italian countryside, but the look of the movie is not enough to distract us from the overall languid pacing, the undramatic exposition, and the lightweight histrionics of Mr. Penn. As a result of such unequal pairing, Kristin Scott Thomas seems almost as if she is occupying this film alone for long stretches of time. Considering the utter richness and beauty of her performance that may not be such a bad thing overall &#150; but 'Up at the Villa' provides her with precious little support all the way around.

Somerset Maugham tends to be somewhat uninspiring; his short stories - frequently rather long - are better, and his essays run the whole gamut from the almost trivial to the almost philosophical. As a writer he is a long long way from novelists like Henry James, Joseph Conrad and Aldous Huxley his characterization is shallow, unreal, such that wherever he sets his scenes - Pago Pago, Firenze or uptown London - one does not connect too well with the tale in question, which, often, fills one with a feeling akin to dejà vu one has seen variations on the theme in previous writings of his. Maugham, then, is very much a one-horse matter, and in most cases, with the passing of time, his stories have become rather insipid.So has 'Up at the Villa'. Even the wonderful Anne Bancroft could do little to rescue this film from being a rather colourless account of well-to-do stiff-upper-lip British people hanging out in Florence on the eve of the Second World War. The dialogues are stiff, wooden, lending much lacklustre to the proceedings and is clearly visible in the performances offered by what, on paper, is a solid cast. But one could not really care whether Kristin Scott Thomas finally made it with Sean Penn, James Fox, or the wretched violinist Jeremy Davies. This last named started off really well, but finally sank into the abjectedness which pervades this film, especially in the second half. The result is a very quaint outdated and outmoded behavioural incursion which ends up being almost farcical, as well as overblown and tedious.No, this is not in any way comparable to 'Gosford Park' (qv) which is magnificent, again with Ms Scott Thomas, far superior with at once more depth and scintillating dialogues. Given the range of Maugham's writing, no way was this film ever to become comparable with 'Portrait of a Lady' (qv), say, 'The Hours' (qv), say, or even the powerful and majestic TV-mini 'Nostromo' (qv). However, 'Up at the Villa' does serve as a pointer inasmuch as it may show in which direction serious attempts at character-driven or dialogue-driven films may be heading, whether period pieces or not.Nice photography in the Italian countryside, and am wondering if part of the film was in fact shot further north of Florence, maybe even in the Lombardy region.

An older man wants the job, he seems agreeable enough and he and the widow have a friendly history. But, it is clear that she is not attractive to him and it would be a marriage of convenience (albeit pleasantly so).The rest of the cast works in that they reflect the dullness and colorlessness of the times (in such a richly colorful place as Italy). People seeking to entertain themselves; mainly older men and women aimlessly hanging on to a foreign country the does not want them. I think that the casting was good. Ann Bancroft was wonderful and James Fox was great Thomas' older suitor. I really like the scenery and the sleepiness of the pacing which picks up after the first half of the movie.Then in the second half of the movie, in an expected turn, the widow, who seems much too naive for her age and station, is the catalyst for an event which causes the roguish character (Sean Penn) to saunters into her life. She spurned him just hours before, but, now she needs his help desperately. And, somehow, his well worn lines become appealing to her, as does he.There is the unlikely pairing of Thomas and Penn characters who are from different worlds, cultures and pedigrees. However, the young widow's choices make a lot of sense if one listens carefully to the dialogue, particularly between her the rogue. The ending is not unexpected, but, well, why don't you can judge for yourself? Check out this movie.

It has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her. She has many difficulties but ultimately finds her happiness in the arms of a man that is not the one that she had an accomplishment with. In this case, our lady is in Florence, some time before World War II. She is an English widow engaged to a rich-but-old man (whom, obviously, she doesn't love). One day she meets another man, who has not a good reputation but for whom she falls in love. Of course there is her friend who will help her for better or worse and a third man- who commits suicide here, in the lady's room, setting up a risky situation for her. Guess how the story ends...?UP AT THE VILLA is not a bad film. I was always quite interested in the story, but never got excited. The problem is not the slow pacing, but the screenplay. Adapted from a novel, it needs something more spicy, exciting, twists and suspense. Every time you think the story will get warm, it gets cooler again. If you think there is a conspiracy involving the mean police chief of Florence, well, there is, but it doesn't change almost anything in the story. It just keeps going and going, till the predictable ending.As I said, UP AT THE VILLA is not bad. If it is a bit bland, it never gets sappy and too sentimental. The acting is half and half, but surely convinces. Kristin Scott Thomas made some really bad choices after THE ENGLISH PATIENT (the saaaaaaappy romantic drama THE HORSE WHISPERER and the dull/irritating RANDOM HEARTS). UP AT THE VILLA is undoubtly better than those pieces and Kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is good as always, even if his character is a big dude. Anne Bancroft is a terrific actress (THE GRADUATE, my God!), and here she doesn't let her character become ridiculous. Now, the supporting actors are pretty bad (Jeremy Davies is sooooooooooo irritating!).The directing is good, but not audacious. It was interesting to know that the director is the same of ANGELS AND INSECTS (also starring Kristin Scott Thomas), another so-so period drama, but more audacious than this. What matters here are the visuals. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are great, the scenery, the music...In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. It is watchable and interesting, but don't expect a suspense film- it is not! This film kind of fails because it wants to have some mystery, something to behold... However, there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow screenplay. Now, about the Oscar nominations, don't worry- it will probably get them.

Set against the luscious but volitile backdrop of Florence, Italy in the late 30s when Facism was on the rise, it's a yarn with a hodgepodge of featured characters, most of whom are not Italian. Veteran English actor James Fox, who only occasionally appears in films, is fine in a small but important role as a British diplomat with the hots for the very available Kristin Scott Thomas. Another celluloid veteran, Anne Bancroft, is effective in a solid supporting role as a busybody American aristocrat with a little dirt on just about everyone. But it's Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Penn who carry the film with their romantic chemistry, playing cat and mouse to the point of no return. Penn isn't quite as intense and hyperbolic as usual, and that approach works well for his character. He displays a Bogart-type of demeanor...strong, determined and slightly understated. Scott Thomas' role and the performance she renders requires a sultry, emotionally seething character who, though desperate, has to play her cards carefully and appear in control.The film's production values are more than adequate, though it would be hard to make Florence look bad. I especially noticed Pino Donaggio's sinuous score. It seems to enhance the film's moods and reminds me of the 30s and 40s when music was used more extensively (sometimes to a fault)in individual scenes to maximize their impact. Another of the film's attributes is the fact that the plot is well organized and pretty easy to track. Too often, films of this genre are convoluted, difficult to follow and blatently implausible. It's not exactly a masterpiece, but if the combination of romance and intrigue float your boat, I think you'll get your money's worth.

Actually, it is even worse!What was so special about that small colony of English expatriates in Florence before the Second World War that the British movie industry might feel justify to devote as many as three feature films to it - first A ROOM WITH A VIEW, then TEA WITH MUSSOLINI, and now this well-packaged turkey? By what I can see, that bunch of obnoxious WASPs was almost exclusively made up of cantankerous old hags and their paunchy hubbies.As I surveyed the sorry lot in the scene (lifted straight out of TEA WITH MUSSOLINI) where they are rounded up for a chat with the local fascist goons, I actually began to MISS Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright and the rest of the eccentric female cast of TEA. At least, THEY had colour. Here, the only patches of colour are provided by Derek Jacobi, as a stylish old queen in exile, and Anne Bancroft, as a wily American princess who thinks that she might one day outwit even the Nazis (and might very well end up doing so, if only she could stop drinking all of those gin sodas and thus gives herself a chance to live that long).Edward Fox also provides some comic relief in the role of a British senior civil servant (perfect in that role, old boy, perfect!) just about to take up an important position as a provincial governor in colonial India and who talks as if he expected that the locals would actually WELCOME his presence there. But even he gets boring after awhile - about midway through his 3-minute scene.As for the two principals (Sean Penn and Kristin Scott Thomas, both on automatic pilot), you cannot really feel sorry for them, as they spend the first half of the movie involving themselves in the most stupid mess, and then the second half painfully extricating themselves out of it. If those two idiots get a little bruised in the process, they have no one to blame but themselves. It may actually offend your sense of justice to see the relative ease with which they get off the hook in the end.Anthony Davies looks and sounds pathetic enough as a penniless refugee but the actor obviously has no a clue about what a pathetic AUSTRIAN refugee is supposed to look and sound like.Finally, the Italian actor Massimo Ghini, who played the role of ZeffirelliÕs father in TEA WITH MUSSOLINI, has now been promoted to the rank of fascist chief of police. Hardly an improvement.The movie - that goes without saying! - is full of gorgeous views of Florence and the surrounding countryside.I resent the fact I had to spend eight bucks on this crap and this is my revenge.

The story focuses on about four days in the life of Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas), an English socialite living in Florence.  Mary's serene and boring life is turned upside down by a proposal from Sir Edgar (James Fox), a very wealthy man she doesn't love; her fascination with Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), a roguish playboy who irritates and attracts her; and a peccadillo with an indigent Austrian refugee.  As if that is not enough excitement for the bland widow, the refugee commits suicide when she tries to explain to him that their night of passion wasn't true love, but an act of kindness and pity on her part.The principal problem here is that the main characters are so flawed that the viewer is unable to care about anything that happens to them.  The only charismatic character is Princess Ferdinando (Anne Bancroft), a delightfully irreverent busybody.  Mary makes so many bad decisions in such a short period that it is difficult to have any respect for her.  Rowley is simultaneously repugnant and pathetic and Sir Edgar is about as interesting as a decapitated mushroom.The best thing about the film is the cinematography and the period renderings.  Director Philip Haas and cinematographer Maurizio Calvesi combine to bring us breathtaking scenes of Florentine splendor.  The Villa that was selected was majestic and the period costumes, cars, furniture and props were wonderfully accurate.  This natural beauty in conjunction with some excellent lighting effects made this film a feast for the eyes.Kristin Scott Thomas' performance was marvelous despite the haplessness of her character.  She was emotional and confused, and she looked lovely doing it.  Sean Penn was utterly miscast as Rowley.  Penn is best playing offbeat and outrageous characters.  In his attempt to contain his natural outlandishness, he came across as far too restrained and lacked the dashing and cavalier attitude that one expects from such a playboy.  Together they had as much chemistry as used dishwater.The best performance was unquestionably that of Anne Bancroft.  She gave an unrestrained and effluent performance as the Grande Dame that glistened with dynamic energy.  It is too bad she didn't get more screen time.I rated this film a 7/10 on the strength of the photography and a great performance by Anne Bancroft.  The story isn't bad, but it is far from inspiring.  It will probably play better to female audiences than male due to the highly emotional nature of the heroine.

Well, this affair ends with tragic results and then the movie becomes quite engrossing and the characters really become interesting.I really enjoyed Kristen Scott Thomas' performance and felt that she portrayed her complex character well.

Sitting on Swift's proposal of marriage over two to three days, she gets to know a dashing American (Penn) who also fancies his chances of a romantic liaison with her and she also develops an instant attraction for a young refugee violinist who plays in her presence at a high-society dinner she is invited to. The story takes a dark and unexpected turn, when after a one-night stand with the violinist, Panton's spurning of the young man's advances, leads to an extreme action on his part.This romantic thriller sees a reunion of director Philip Haas working with actress Kristin Scott Thomas (they worked together on Angels and Insects) and plus points here include the writing of Belinda Haas which on the whole is entertaining and intuitive and the performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Penn who are both strong in the lead roles. Also inadvertently topical (at least in Britain right now) is the portrayal of the reception given in society circles to refugees from other countries - distrust and suspicion being the order of the day.Up at the Villa doesn't attempt to take on weightier topics relating to fascist Italy and the influx of refugees, Haas instead concentrating on a storyline that details the dramatic episodes that envelop his heroine over a period of 48 hours, and even though the character of Swift is to some extent the kind of patronisingly sexist English gentleman from yesteryear who thankfully now belongs to history, Penn brings warmth to his dashing American suitor and KST is particularly good as a woman of substance who finds out more about herself over a tensely staged 48 hours.

The story is amoral, having ingredients of romance and suspense. The greatest problem, in my point of view, is the lack of chemistry between the characters of Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Penn. Somehow they do not fit each other, but maybe this is the intention of the novel. I have not read the book. However, it is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.

Built around the Thomas character, what the film lacks in depth it makes up for with a well crafted script, excellent performances, and grand scenery.

But the plot is a tad confusing.  I get the romance and even some of the suspense that comes in the romance and drama.  It's just something in this film that struck me odd.  Oh well, I still think adults will like this film for it's actors- Kristen Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft and Jeremy Davies, who made a breakthrough in Saving Private Ryan, and almost saves the movie here.

The film opens at a ballroom in 1930s Italy which is populated by vulgar Americans and uptight upper class Brits , but in truth UP AT THE VILLA plays out far more like a Merchant -Ivory production which is very bad news because it`s a very slow , and I do mean very slow romantic drama with some of the romance being very unlikely . If you like slow romantic dramas you might like this movie . I didn`t   "}]
