I think Hoodlum fell victim to this epidemic.  With a bankroll of wonderful actors and actresses, and some of the best historical recreation of the locations, the movie delivers. The plot was simple, but it doesn't need to be complicated in a gangster flick like this.  It was based on real people, so the creators of the film cannot go ballistic on changing the story.  Maybe the 'critics' would like it better if it had a little green man who uses the force, or maybe a future crime prevention device.  Well, you won't find this here.  It's a wonderful, semi-true story about the way things were in Harlem and the surroundings areas back then.  Fishburn turned in a wonderful performance, and Roth played a great villian as he always does.  Just relax, and take it for what it's meant to be.  Entertainment.

Bill Duke, its talented director, gives us a picture of what the Harlem of the thirties was like. In fact, Hoodlum suffers when it's compared to Coppola's The Cotton Club. Mr. Duke, an actor himself, was able to amass a great cast and he got performances that are amazing from this first rate ensemble.The cast headed by the brilliant Laurence Fishburn is amazing. Mr. Fishburn is basically the whole reason for watching the film. His Bumpy Johnson is a larger than life figure in that era. Tim Roth also is quite amazing as Dutch Schultz, a white man who saw the hidden treasures of the black community of Harlem and tried to capitalize in that world. Andy Garcia plays Lucky Luciano, an Italian man who also was instrumental in the criminal activities one sees in the film.Also in the cast, Vanessa Williams, Cicely Tyson, Loretta Devine, William Atherton, Queen Latifah, and the rest, respond well to Mr. Duke's command.The film is entertaining and will not disappoint fans of the genre, or of Mr. Duke.

Although Hoodlum boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when Hoodlum appeared in 1997.The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical African-American mobster. He peruses books, plays chess, and pens poetry. As literate as Bumpy is, he can pull a trigger or wield a knife without a pang of remorse when somebody threatens a person who he loves. Like The Godfather II and Once Upon A Time in America, Hoodlum charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride of I, Robot) and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly, you won't see anything in Hoodlum that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. Hoodlum features notorious real-life racketeers such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth of Pulp Fiction) and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia of Godfather III) as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (William Atherton of The Sugarland Express). When Bumpy arrives in Harlem, he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) who is the so-called 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob.Meanwhile, the boorish, grubby, low-life Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way, Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine (Vanessa Williams) who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam, he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her live-and-let-live notions. Eventually, Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal, and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly, gangster gunfire chops down a young, innocent numbers runner. Now, Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody.The film's publicity notes claim that Hoodlum is complete fiction, but historical characters populate the story. Of course, movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic, so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters. Refusing to portray these events as they actually occurred, Duke and Brancato blow a fantastic opportunity to exploit their melodramatic potential. Duke, whose directorial credits include Deep Cover and A Rage in Harlem, wrestles with the obvious lapses in Brancato's script. The length of Hoodlum may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half, the film's momentum bogs down, and Hoodlum loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper.The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies, the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy, as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently, Hoodlum concludes on an anti-climax. Moreover, the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome. For the record, the gangster who hires Shaft to find his kidnapped daughter in Shaft is a variation on Bumpy as is the kingpin mobster in American Gangster with Denzel Washington. The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The action-packed first half is more entertaining than the tedious, long-winded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens.Fishburne is riveting as a tough-as-nails but warm-hearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice.Despite some flavorful dialogue, Hoodlum plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's Harlem Nights may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no Godfather, Hoodlum is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in Hell Up in Harlem. If you enjoy gangster epics, Hoodlum is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged Hoodlum for its debatable morality. Ironically, Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fade-out, however, Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.

A black man named Ellsworth `Bumpy' Johnson (Lawrence Fishburne) was released from prison and went back to Harlem.  Then he joins his cousin, Illinois Gordon, and gets back into an illegal lottery racket ran by Madame Queen.  They call the game `numbers.'  They say that numbers is the only business in Harlem which provides them with work.  A white man from uptown named Dutch Shultz (Tim Roth) is also trying to run the numbers downtown in Harlem, and there ends up being a battle between Shultz and the Queen.  Madame goes to jail and leaves Bumpy in charge. Bumpy meets a fine woman, Francine (Vanessa Williams), who sees good in him and wants him to stop messing around with `numbers.'  But she stays by his side while things get chaotic.  Will he realize what he should do in time or will he lose everything?The director Bill Duke has a message in this movie.               It says when people are left limited options, they are going to find a way to get by.  In one scene, Bumpy is telling Illinois because of the depression there isn't very many jobs and white men didn't leave them any jobs, so they had no options for making money other than through the numbers racket.This movie had fast paced action.  I liked the part where Dutch Shultz wants Madame Queen's organization out of the numbers racket in Harlem, so he can make all the money from it.  Bumpy, who works for Madame Queen, comes up with a plan for eliminating the problem of Dutch, by getting Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia), another gangster, and Dutch in a fight.

I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time, however Hoodlum ends up turning its-self into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened, having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming, and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found my-self comparing him to Joe Pesci at times , and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong, elegant , proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away , there was good use of make-up , wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time , its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre.HOODLUM  8.1 OUT OF 10POWER IS MEASURED IN ENEMIES...

Johnson, fresh from a stint in prison, goes to work for successful Harlem numbers racketeer Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson), then takes over the operation when she is sent to prison. His approach, unsurprisingly, is much different and more proactive than hers, which comes in handy when they are forced to deal with the activities of Arthur Flegenheimer, a.k.a. Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), a pathologically greedy, flamboyantly nasty creep just full of swagger.Fishburne commands the screen with his calm and cool performance as Bumpy. His Bumpy is a man never caught off guard, a man with his own philosophy and way of life that prevents him from wanting to enter churches. His love story in this fictionalization is Francine Hughes, played by the lovely Vanessa L. Williams, who adds a great deal of humanity to the scenario as she tries to distance herself from Bumpys' actions; even when she is clearly acting in self defense as she shoots a would be assassin, she feels very uneasy about it.Andy Garcia is merely passable as mob boss of the day Lucky Luciano, but there are plenty of other despicable antagonists to raise the ire of the audience. Richard Bradford plays a corrupt police captain, calling to mind his role in The Untouchables, except that here his character is a racist as well. William Atherton plays real life attorney Thomas Dewey, who is portrayed as being just as crooked as anyone in this tale. The radiant Tyson shines in her limited screen time. Chi McBride supplies both comedy relief and a level of heart as Bumpys' cousin Illinois Gordon, and Loretta Devine is likable as his lady friend. Queen Latifah isn't given much to do in her small supporting role. Some very fine character actors dot the landscape Clarence Williams III, real life brothers Mike and Beau Starr, Paul Benjamin, Joe Guzaldo, Ed O'Ross, J.W. Smith, Eddie Bo Smith Jr., and John Toles-Bey. Roth tends to steal the show, although there's nothing subtle about his performance or the way that Schultz is written.On the technical side, some reasonably good period recreation is done, Bill Duke directs with style, and there's a lovely score by Elmer Bernstein as well as a few musical numbers.Hoodlum is decent entertainment, but that's what it is entertainment. It's only loosely based on the real stories of the real life people involved, so it isn't to be mistaken for a history lesson.Seven out of 10.

Fishburne holds his own as a gangster trying to be the gangster and the romantic interest. This will not work to his favour. Vanessa Williams delivers a strong performance as his love interest who is questioning the lifestyle he is involved in.

For those of you who don't, Johnson was a member of an organized crime group, in Harlem, during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film, the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately, I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job, my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character, Roth went a little over the top with it, but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano, but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame, because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story, but as a film, it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best, but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told.

It is the height of the depression and a Negro, Bumpy Johnson, has just been released from gaol. He returns to find that the Queen's gambling racket is being threatened by a white man from downtown. Everybody in Harlem is happy with the way things are - people play the numbers game and win enough to put food on the table. But numbers is a very big business and the mafia wants a piece of it. The mafia boss of the time, Lucky Lucino, is content to let it go, but one of his underlings wants a piece of the action and soon a gang war breaks out.This is the typical inter-war style movie with corrupt cops and politicians and crime running rife. The prohibition years are over, but people are making money now by other rackets, and the American system of brutal monopoly is leaving blood on the streets and the corrupt politicians are supporting those who have the most money. It is a time of lawlessness and strife, and in a way we should feel glad we don't live there. Another thing about the time is that the Negro is still very much in the underclass and there is a lot of prejudice and tension between the races.The major theme here is how power corrupts. The Queen is taken to gaol and she gives Bumpy the business to run. Bumpy is a very intelligent man, but he is also very stubborn. He refuses to give into the non-Negros and will continue to fight until one is dead. Unfortunately his stubbornness brings about the death of many innocent people. During this time, his girlfriend walks out on him, and his cousin begins to disown him, yet he refuses to give in because he believes he is right.This movie really looks at the tragedy of this, but it is not that tragic because Bumpy soon sees how he has changed and will begin to change before it is too late. But then with the death of his cousin, one can argue it is too late. His girlfriend has left, and chastises him for being so stubborn that he refuses to step into a church to pay respects for one of the dead. He finally steps into a church to pay respect to his cousin, and then walks straight out. As such we see the beginning of a change, but we don't follow through with it. The problems have been solved, and Harlem has its autonomy - what happens to Bumpy in the future is for the future.

Bumpy was a pimp, burglar and stickup man who possessed a recalcitrant attitude. He always carried a knife and gun, neither of which he was hesitant to use. All too often Bumpy ended up in barroom clashes over the slightest of issues. He feared nobody and did not shy from confrontations. Helen Lawrenson, in her book Stranger at the Party, remarked on Bumpy's short fuse and arrogance. He never learned, however, to curb his temper or to bow his head to any man, She wrote. really? because watching the movie, one would find that bumpy exemplified self-control and discipline. and who did he rob, other than schultz's numbers racket? they conveniently left out the pimping part too - or wait - maybe he was a benevolent pimp? i'm not saying there should not have been a hero, but heroes can have flaws. this film has some good scenes and acting (tim roth is always on the money, and this is one of my favourite performances of his) but ultimately for me it fell a little shy of the mark. the director has abandoned what could have been (with a bit more work) a well-framed and stoic reminder of a past era, in favour of cheap Hollywood drama. was it supposed to rely on historical texts, including every detail of 1930s harlem? absolutely not. but would duke have done a service to his audience had he made the characters somewhat more true to life and responsive to their respective situations? i think he had a duty to do so.

But we have come to develop a strange kind of love of these characters, despite the evil they perpetrate.  Hoodlum's greatest problem is not that it attacks the gangsters we know and love, but the way in which it does it. If the leading character had been played by a more charismatic actor (Denzel Washington or Wesley Snipes would have been much better choices), it may have been more successful, but I felt alienated by Fishburne's character as he went up against my pals of movies past - Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia) and Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth).I also felt that art direction was sub-standard - many of the sets had a clean, new feel to them, which was very much out of place.On the positive side, the performances from Garcia and Roth, in particular, were good, but they alone were not enough to lift this movie above mediocrity.

In a world impoverished by the great depression, the single largest business in Harlem is an illegal lottery known as the `numbers'.  For many, a winning numbers slip is the only chance to put food on the table.  The undisputed leader of the Harlem numbers is Madame Queen, who has run this multi-million dollar business quietly and peacefully for over a decade.  Notorious gangster Dutch Schultz has defied the wishes of his partner, crime chief Charles `Lucky' Luciano and decided it's time to share in the profits.  There is only one obstacle in Dutch Schultz's path of destruction.  His name is Ellsworth `Bumpy' Johnson.'That's the legend that comes on screen before the film starts, it basically tells you everything you need to know about the plot.  Essentially it's an old fashioned gang war style film - it even has the spinning newspaper headlines and the background shots of people firing machine guns!  The story holds no surprises and it's nothing new, however it is entertaining enough stuff if a little too long for it's own good.The way it is put together is very workman-like way.  It has all the old tricks that other gangster films do and it doesn't do anything new.  As such the cast don't do anything special either.  Fishburne is nowhere near his best, he could have done this in his sleep.  Similarly Garcia doesn't do anything special.  Roth however hams it up wildly with his American accent thick as ever.  The support cast stick to their stereotypes well - Williams plays the beautiful `virgin' type sucked into the gangster world, and various henchmen do their thing well.  The cast does have some terrible performances - many of the black gangsters in fact are quite bad.  The worst by far is the actress who played Madame Queen.  She isn't convincing for one second, her accent is ridiculous and her performance is bad ham in every scene.Overall it's entertaining, although could have easily been 30 minutes shorter.

Metaphors are overdone and almost cast in neon, like the chessboard which is used to signify Fishbourne's character's (Bumpy) strategic genius.Scripting is perhaps the weakest part of this movie. There are scenes that function almost on a narrative level by telling us how we should feel about certain aspects of the plot, situation, setting or characters. For instance, like the evolution, so to speak, of Bumpy (Fishbourne).A rather poignant scene takes place highlighting in two very transparent plot sequences that Bumpy has indeed changed after he became a full out gangster. These scenes are designed to let the watcher know that Bumpy has changed, instead of highlighting dramatically that he has. The conscious inclusion of a point like this, particularly as a major plot piece, shows a very poorly flushed out script that is more pieced together and edited and re-edited.Finally, thematically and structurally this movie parallels the Godfather I and II in some very significant ways. Bumpy for instance, although a more willing participant initially within organized crime than Michael Corleone was is almost a straight copy of his character. Even major events in the plot are paralleled in Godfather I and II.Despite all these short-coming, this is a fairly immersive piece in terms of set and setting, but with par-level cinematography, lighting and effects, the cons far outweigh to pros for this piece, I can not recommend it. Although not terrible, it's certainly not redeemable.If you want to see a Gangster/Mob piece see the Godfather Trilogy, Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, Casino or any other movie of this genre before seeing this one.

The central protagonist presents just the right balance of determination, ruthless violence, and moral ambiguity, including a softer side or undeniable richness and complexity. The heroes and villains are clearly defined; the justification for the heroes to find themselves on the 'wrong side of the law' is unarguable. The gangster film has long been a genre in which Americans could work through their worst fears of living in a nation of many ethnicities; it just makes sense that the perfect gangster film would be about African Americans - the one ethnic group that is still denied total participation in our culture.The period detail is excellent and the direction is solidly professional; so is the acting; in fact that is a major point in favor of this film, and all such films, that all the participants approach their work with as careful and as a skilled a professionalism as possible. They were clearly determined right from the start to make a good movie, and they did. Surprisingly, very few Hollywood films are made with this attitude, since it's assumed there that most audiences don't care. well this audience member certainly cares, and I both admire and respect the professional when it appears.Beyond the richness of its issues, the film is also very entertaining. Yes, it is violent; it is also humorous, romantic, dramatic, and even, at times, philosophical. Much like The Godfather (which is a bit over-long to my taste), hoodlum is a 'complete package' gangster film that will leave you with a sense of having experienced life a little deeper than if you hadn't seen it.

This is just atrocious film wrecking. The script reminded me of a mad libs where instead of a noun, they just wrote curse words and racial slurs. It felt like the creators were aiming at entertaining the homeless insane demographic instead of intelligent individuals who wouldn't see straight through this malarky. But I have a story with this film that made it worth seeing. There was 7 people in the theater when we stumbled into this car wreck of a movie, my three friends, two other guys a few seats down and an African American couple in front of us. I was so offended by this film's utter lack of cohesive character plot, goals and motivations, creativity, etc., that my friends and I debated with the strangers next to us in the theater whether we should just leave and play area 51, a game we loathed! I was actually worried that because I was white, maybe the couple in front of us would think we were a bunch of racist jerks for leaving half way through, because it seemed to be really pretending that it was a powerful Black statement. Then the AA couple started laughing every time Larry Fishbourne said N***** pennies and we stayed. Two thirds in, all 7 of us turned it into a MST3K episode. We were laughing at every other line, inserting show tunes at inappropriate moments and would loudly boo and call the actors names any time the pennies were mentioned. I never would have done this had the AA dude not started throwing Junior Mints at the screen. All in all, terribly wooden acting, eerily clean set design for the 30's, bizarre and frustratingly convoluted plot and lame ass action. But hilarious theater experience.

Like many Americans I've been developed to have a strong sense of attraction to both real and fictional crime personalities. Cagney, Robinson, Bogart. Capone, Luciano, Gotti&#133; You know the drill.This is probably why I wanted to love it, but the film just wouldn't allow me to. It never gets exciting enough.In Hoodlum the main characters; Johnson, Queenie, Hewlett, Schultz, Luciano; are all played just well enough to give you a basic outline of how the real life persons were related to one another. Otherwise they're basically stock representations of what Hollywood seems to always believe everyone wants to see in genre crime films, or maybe just something Dukes felt was necessary to make it fit the genre along with all the the typical gobbledy gook that's SUPPOSED to cause you to react in a certain way. Ewwww! He places a bit of human anatomy on the night club table! Oh my! The poor man has distanced himself from those closest to him in order to fulfill a noble, if cruel, mission!Yet it never gets horrible enough to really make you feel it. A woman is murdered, but you don't see anything beyond her fright. Even her boyfriend's reaction at finding her body isn't given enough attention for you to understand what he feels. You're always 'watching' other people react to situations&#133; You're never in a position to see their feelings or to truly feel anything yourself.Romance comes together weakly and ends weakly. Chattering tommy gun montages float but no bodies shiver. Death comes and goes like Spring rain.Roth's Schultz is, to my mind's eye, the only thing near a believable performance. He dresses, speaks and conducts himself much the way the real Schultz would've. The 'race' issue is weirdly half-hyped throughout this film though it is presented in a manner easily recognizable as commonplace during the period. The film makes the mistake of making this almost too important a part of the story by having it pop into the script when it hardly matters. That a corrupt 1930s chief of police is also a die-hard racist and some black doesn't like it and says so is not quite as cutting edge as it might've been 25 years ago.I'm no longer amused by Luciano being shown as the dapper smoothie. The real person wasn't as dapper as he was clever.All the same, it isn't likely that Luciano would've had a man shot in the back of his own limousine while he's sitting right next to him protecting his face from blood-splatter with his spotless Panama hat. Do you know how much a Panama hat cost? They should've thrown in a joke to help that scene along.The Dewey portrayal was totally ridiculous. His relationship to Luciano was never so chummy as the film wants to suggest. Far from it in fact.What the film did do is give me a thirst to learn more about the real people. It was nice to learn why Clarence Williams' Hewlett character stood so firmly with Schultz. (In real life Hewlett's operation had been knocked out of prominence by Queenie's gang); that Queenie had been attracted to Bumpy's style and bravado; that Queenie sent a message to Schultz while he lay dying in a hospital helps to lend some validity to this movie's suggestion of how some troubles may have been fomented between Schultz and Luciano.They skip over valuable and interesting detail in favor of weak emotional inference. Offering a a touch of supposedly, meaningful-to-blacks religious suggestion. An odd blend of Christianity and voodoo. Some grinning church toady at the start and finish of the story. Who really needed this? Attaching blacks to religion is just a longtime stereotype in America anyway. Everybody knows it, so please stop already!They had everything they needed but didn't handle the pieces well enough to make this the winner it might've been. Even the music sounded as though it had been lifted from Morricone and Coppola. Why no Ellington; Basie; Bird???? What the heck ? ? ? Bumpy might've had pretensions but it's very likely that he preferred to listen to the hot music of his time.Pardon me. It's my first time here. Not the worst thing I've ever seen but I'd suggest you watch it in bed.

It's acting is clunky and irritating and i find it surprising that the one comment available on this web site is in praise of it. You will forgive me for questioning the reliability of this...but the writer must by no stretch of the imagination be a complete moron if he has any feeling stronger than disdain for the candour of this film.I am sure that any of the principal artist involved share my opinion of the films utter unnecessary quality (their Pilate's and colonic irrigation funds must have been running low)...to put it bluntly i wouldn't imagine it's something they put in their C.V.NEVER WATCH THIS FILM IT IS DREADFUL "}]
