[{"Title":"Extremely affective tale about being seventeen","Date":"13 November 2004","Score":"27 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Browsing through some of the previous comments, it seems many viewers take the movie primarily as an allegory of class clash in Beijing. While the movie does state the contrast with emphasis, it's much more interesting as a story about teens. The title translates literally to seventeen years' bicycle.The story is just that. Guo is a young man who earned a bicycle and promptly has it stolen. Through luck and perseverance, he finds it in the possession of Jian, a high school student. Trouble ensues.I grew up in Taiwan, and I remember kids doing incredibly cruel things to each other. Not so much gunning down classmates but there were plenty of physical and emotional violence. This movie is a powerhouse of insight into the psyche of teenagers. Contemporary Hollywood pumps out teenage movies by the dozen each year, and most simply gloss over the amount of pain and awkwardness adolescence can bring. Beijing Bicycle, on the other hand, can serve as an instructional manual for any high-school bully wannabes on how to reduce the stammering geek next door to a shell of a man.It's therefore understandable that the movie can be very difficult to watch at moments. Guo suffers humiliation after humiliation, and at times I wondered in frustration what it would take to get him to swing back (the ending provides some answer to that, I think). There is some humor in the movie, and Guo does have the resources to prevail occasionally. If you can stand two main characters respectively passive and oblivious, the story is an incredibly touching one about being young.

Guei (Cui Lin) is an unexpressive working class 17-year old who has come to Beijing to find work, while Jian (Li Bin), is a sophisticated middle-class student, desperate to belong, seeking approval from his biker friends and his beautiful girlfriend Gin (Zhao Yiwel). The film explores the consequences when Guei's bicycle is stolen and ends up in Jian's hands. The bicycle represents an escape for both from the competitive pressures of their lives. For Guei, it is a means of access to a job, an income, and survival. For Jian, it is the pathway to being cool and being in the in-group, much like what the flashy sports car represents to young men in Western countries. As the film opens, a group of boys are being interviewed for a job as a courier. Enticed by the prospect of owning a silver mountain bike, Guei takes the job and begins to save money to buy the bike, given to him as a loan (the bike is his once he has earned 700 yuan, which is about $85). Out of his element in the bewildering city, Guei runs into an awkward situation almost immediately when he makes a delivery in a luxury hotel and is directed to the gym where he is forced to strip for a shower before he can deliver his package. He is then asked to pay for the shower when he leaves but does not have enough money. When his bike is stolen just one day before he can become the owner, Guei's job is threatened. Xie Jian as Guei's manager is both abrasive and compassionate and offers to take Guei back to work if he can find his bike. In a city where bicycles are still the most common means of transportation, against all odds he sets out to find it. The film is about the bicycle but is also about the city of Beijing. Guei's search for the bicycle takes him into all corners of the city. With an original score by Felix Wang and magnificent cinematography by Jie Liu, the city comes alive with streets littered with traffic juxtaposed with mysterious alleys where old men play board games or do Tai Chi. Wang adds the little touches as well such as two friends sharing a toothbrush and a single spigot of water in an alley serving an entire neighborhood.Like De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, the stolen bicycle is central to the story, but here it is not about the hunt but about the consequences that follow from its recovery. When the student Jian is found with the bike, both he and Guei assert ownership and the bike is stolen and reclaimed by both boys several times, each time ending in a scuffle with Jian's friends. In a powerful confrontation with his father, Jian, in a rage against his father for reneging on his promise to buy him a bike, finally admits to stealing his father's money to purchase the bike himself at the flea market after it was fenced. The two boys are pitted against each other but mutual need brings them together and allows them to work out a compromise by alternating the days when each can use the bike. Eventually a serious confrontation takes place that escalates into a startling conclusion.Beijing Bicycle is a deeply human odyssey that, while somewhat repetitive, never loses its rhythm. Though there is little dialogue and the characters communicate mostly with body language, long silences, and facial expressions, the actors perform their roles with astonishing authenticity. Parts of the film are emotionally upsetting, but there is also a sweet innocence at play. Jian acts like a typical adolescent-surly, angry with his parents, shy with girls, audacious and impetuous one minute, and then needy and contrite the next. In one of the concluding scenes, as a group of punks chase two boys through a an older section of Beijing; one says to the other, What are you doing? This doesn't concern you. The other replies, I don't know my way out. In today's new China, caught between the traditions of an ancient culture and the new urban reality, young people are having trouble finding their way out.

A poor man, having recently come to the city from the country, wins a job at a bicycle courier business, and, on a delivery, gets his bike stolen. He then proceeds to search the city of Beijing to retrieve it. Luckily, it quickly veers away from being a simple update of that classic story. He finds the alleged thief, a high school kid, and steals it back. For the first hour or more, the bike moves back and forth between them. The two characters are compared and contrasted, and it works as an effective class study.The direction and editing are particularly great in the film. The climax involves two intersecting chases, and it is one of the best stages sequences I've ever seen. There are a couple of problems, small ones for me, but perhaps big ones for critics and audiences. The high school kid is extraordinarily unlikable. A person behind me declared loudly, What a brat! And he is. I personally don't mind if a character is unsympathetic (although we are asked to sympathize with him, I believe). My own biggest problem is that the ending is slightly unsatisfactory. There's not much closure. Still, Beijing Bicycle is an excellent film. 9/10.

Set in Beijing it tracks the efforts of a young man from the countryside to find his self-sufficient place in a bustling and rawly energetic city.  For him, obtaining a position as a bicycle messenger for a company serving the commercial firms of the city seems to be a satisfactory end, not a beginning as it probably would be were this film set in a Western metropolis.For a New Yorker, where bicycle messengers are simultaneously often hated and frequently and with good measure feared, the operation of the Beijing counterpart, with messengers uniformly attired and equipped with identical mountain bikes, is both strange and familiar.Central to the film is the theft of the coveted bicycle one day before it would become the personal property of the messenger (the company's scheme allows employees to earn ownership after what appears to be a short period of service).  The bike turns up in the hands of a post-high school youth, part of a loose gang of bicycle worshipers.  Much of the story revolves around the subsequent relay race of seizures of the bike with attendant and escalating violence.The intensity of the competition between two young men for the bike reflects its importance not only economically (bikes appear in huge numbers in wide shots of broad avenues and busy streets) but also personally.  These young men probably don't even have nocturnal fantasies of car ownership.A wary but real bond develops between the suitors for bike ownership and the violence that engulfs them is palpably real and painful to watch.  There is no real resolution for either of them it seems.Beijing Bicycle would have benefited from some judicious editing and the deletion of an extraneous secondary story line (or two) that detracts from the main tale.  The score is very nice and the acting strong.  This is not the Beijing of Tianamen Square or of the flourishing fast food outlets.  It is, however, a Beijing that has a number of striking similarities to neighborhoods known to many of us. And in that lies the film's interest and attractiveness.

Don't be absurd there's not a single moment that could profitably have been cut. The details of Beijing life we see may or may not develop character or advance the story, but they're worth watching all by themselves, and Wang only includes those details which he correctly senses are not out of place. This is a film as sturdily and artfully made as the bicycle of the title, and it's simply a pleasure - a rare pleasure, unfortunately - to see dialogue, images, music and incidental sound fitting together so nicely. The long stretches with no dialogue at all are as communicative as they need to be and anything but contrived. I probably wouldn't even have noticed them if it hadn't been for the fact that I didn't speak Mandarin and was thus relieved not to have to read subtitles.It's amazing how much Wang manages to convey in what is, after all, a very short time (just 113 minutes). I even got a sense of why so many people were willing to align themselves with Qin (the one who either stole the bicycle from Guo or bought it from the real thief with stolen money - we're never entirely certain), even though he comes across as perhaps the least worthwhile person in the world. When his friends offer to help him retrieve the bicycle - and later on, as they try to retrieve it - they have the air of people who know they're in the wrong, who are trying to justify their mistaken decision to waste energy on the wrong person by wasting still more energy. We get a similar sense from Qin's suitor, Xiao, and even from Qin's family. We get a strong sense of the society in which all of these people live and of how the world must appeal to them.And even though there may be no closure at the end - although I don't know what closure is and I suspect that people who use the word probably don't either - few films are quite as satisfying.

The peasants who stream in from the countryside must quickly adapt to the harsh inequalities of female organ donation even though nothing in their backgrounds has prepared them to do so. These cultural shifts have led to a strong national cinema. A new generation of directors has been right on top of China's big changes, and the best of their movies make us care about the individuals being buffeted by social upheaval. Unfortunately, artful characterization is where the chain comes off Beijing Bicycle.Director Xiaoshui Wang uses a bicycle as his symbol for the changing social landscape. Running away from rural poverty, teenager Guei migrates to Beijing and lands a job as a bicycle messenger. If he works hard enough, he can buy his bike from the company and make a bigger percentage of the profits for each package he delivers. Just before he pays off his debt, the bike is stolen. Guei loses not only his livelihood, but also his pride and sense of purpose. Using the stubbornness and determination that carried him to the city in the first place, Guei sets out to recover the bike.The bike ends up in the hands of Jian, a teenager whose lower-middle-class family has promised him a bike, but can't deliver on the promise because they need the money to pay his younger sister's school fees. Jian wants a bicycle to keep up with his more affluent school buddies and to impress a girl classmate. How Jian got the bike, and what happens when Guei steals it back from him form the spinal-column of this earstwhilst fairytale.This movie has two big flaws. First, Guei and Jian may be realistic portrayals of real-life teenagers, but neither of them is a very appealing person. Geui is inarticulate and maddeningly passive. Jian, is surly, selfish, and self-absorbed. Neither actor can break out of the constraints of caricature imposed by the script. The audience ends up suffering through yet another instance of the imitative fallacy art that simply mimics real life is not really art. The second problem is padded scenes that put the brake on the pacing. A better editor would have cut several dragged-out moments and lopped some of the repetitive action.Skip this movie and see Together, by Kaige Chen, a much more artful look at a teenager trying to make it in the big city, or even the wonderful Iranian film, The Children of Heaven, Majid Majidi's look at what it means when children decide to share an Oxford dorm room.

It ostensibly deals with a delicate and difficult subject that China confronts in its frenzied project of modernization the floating population who lives on the edge of the city, the marginalized group that can no longer be glossed over in the grand narrative of urbanization. This floating population is the abjection, the cluster that can not be assimilated, the group being ruthlessly cast away but stubbornly clings on, and protests in silence; it is a disoriented group, usually incompatible to the ever-changing landscape of metropolitans; their voice is constantly being submerged in the hubbub of the sleepless cities. Indeed, the floating population is aphemic. What strikes me, frustrates me and saddens me is Gui's inability to communicate, to speak out, and to articulate for himself. (This is a little far off, but I was reminded of the similar frustration I had as a little girl when reading 'the little mermaid' if the mermaid has not given her voice away to the witch, she could tell the prince that it was she who saved him and wins his love.) Similar to the little mermaid, Gui could not speak up when he was wronged and abused. For instance, all Gui could convey to get his bicycle back is either his obstinate silence or his repeated sentence zhe che ben lai jiu shi wo de (the bicycle is originally mine). His desperate, strident and continuous cry when being forced with violence by Jian's gang to let go off his bicycle is simply heart-breaking. Who is to blame for Gui's aphasia? Is it class division? Is it his own dislocation? Or is it the indifference of the city with its condescending atmosphere? The picture is definitely not black and white. The result of his aphasia, on the other hand, is more self-evident at the end of the movie, Gui eventually turns to violence to break his silence&#133; It is said that at least 60% of the crime that happens in Chinese cities comes from the floating population. They are suggested to be the root of the social problems. News reports constantly show how the innocent city folks are being hurt and robbed by those the other from the abjection, the floating population. Beijing Bicycle, however, attempts to approach this abjection, to speak up for those who do not speak for themselves, and allow us to sympathize with their plight.

Director Wang Xiaoshuai borrows not just the seedling idea but much of the approach of the Italian Neo-Realist classic.  A stolen bicycle leads two boys from one sad situation to another, and Wang lets those situations determine the film's form, rather than using deliberate techniques to give it shape.  This result is going to inspire different responses--like `Ladri di biciclette' itself, it's going to seem refreshingly artless to some, frustratingly aimless to others.  Likewise, the film's tremendous stillness is going to draw some viewers in while alienating others.  There are passing comments on image, perception, and class divisions, but the style (Chinese-Italian Neo-Neo-Realism?) really prevents the director from exploring any of these ideas too thoroughly.  Personally, while I appreciate the respectful approach to the film's inspiration, I wish Wang would have really cut loose with some radical new take on `Ladri,' as Tim Burton did with his masterpiece, `Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.'  As it is, `Shiqi sui de dan che' left me a little bit cold; it was all done is good taste, but the result was curiously lifeless.  For all his deference to De Sica, Wang can't really recreate the Italian director's emotional depth, no matter how precisely he recreates his style.  Without that depth, this film is as beautiful as a series of still photographs, but no more alive.  6 out of 10.

Beijing Bicycle is a simple, yet symbolic film about a young man who comes to the big city, gets a job as a bicycle messenger, and things quickly go from uncomfortable, to bad, to awful, to worse it seems. Guei (the messenger) wasn't raised to recognize the ways of a metropolis, which tries to chew him up piece by piece. We get to know other characters who we believe (along with Guei) ARE who they appear to be. Beijing Bicycle has to be the finest expression of what I would expect to be the current set of fears by those in China who see their future as an unknown, with the replacement model being the U.S.A.. This story expresses the huge doubts caused by the loss of Mao and the Communist way of life. Even if it WASN'T perfect, they were familiar with it, and many of these new world things did not happen THEN. Those who are (literally) buying into the free market concepts, are losing their pride, identities, and souls. Watch for the slow, steady transitions of situations and characters.

The director, Wang, is being called a 6th generation Chinese film director, from a long tradition of great movie-making despite the political censorship inherent in communist China.  I am sure the censors let this one through because of the theme of peasant nobility and capitalist corruption.  They let this one pass because it also shows the tremendous urban development of China's ancient capital, where great projects of high-rise housing are dwarfing and replacing the old hardscrabble alleyways.  It is clear that Chinese entrepreneurs are beginning to accumulate great wealth as capitalistic enterprises are being not only tolerated, but encouraged by the old guard, who are realizing the tremendous economic potential of a billion energetic and hardworking people.Since China is becoming more open and industrialized, not to mention technologically sophisticated,  the powers that be are showing off with this stunning film.  Beijing is beginning to rival Tokyo in terms of developing garish areas of entertainment, including the adrenalin-rushing venues of video games and carnival arcades, populated by hopping and harem-scarem teenagers.  There is a pulsating intensity that is almost New York City or Las Vegas, luring the kids to blow their allowances, cut school and smoke cigarettes.  Into this hodge-podge of posh high-rise hotels and down-and-dirty slums we have a voyeuristic view of present-day Beijing.If you were a normal American tourist, you would never see this interior view, so the movie is worth the price of a socio-anthropoligical tour that would have cost in  5 or 6 figures.  Therefore, the movie is a great bargain because in less than two hours the viewer is exposed to cinema art at its highest level, with a synthesis of a classic story, one dramatic situation after another, subtle and powerful acting, original and creative cinematography, tied together with a pounding and relentless soundtrack that keeps the forward motion escalating to the very end.The Shakespearean plot is mindful of `Romeo and Juliet' and `West Side Story.'  The protagonists are teenagers, but the story is such that this over-used American term simply does not apply.  These adolescents are young men and young women.  And what emerges is the fact of China's one-child policy, in which many female newborns were dispatched, leaving the present China with many more young men than young women.  At a billion and growing, China needed birth control.  They formulated a plan and enforced it.  Now what is the fallout?The consequence of this policy seems to lead to white-hot competition between the males, and therefore gets primitively brutal at times.  That has always been the case, given human nature, but we see that Chinese young men have not developed their aggression to the point of shooting up their classmates.  They are not above braining each other every now and then with a brick, but bruised and bloody, they wake up from being knocked out and are ready for more conflict.  Their 5000 year civilization keeps them trying to compromise and halting their aggression just short of murder, unlike the Europeans.The competition is naturally about who's going to win the heart of the lovely girl.  In this bicycle film, the heroes are those who can do the greatest tricks with a bike, and especially the latest mountain bikes, with shock absorbers, rugged tires and multiple gears.  They can bounce up steps with them, whirl around on wheelies and even maintain a precarious balance while stationary.  The girl is attracted to the Marlon Brando type who performs the best tricks bare-chested and who is cool enough to smoke cigarettes and carry a Zippo lighter.  Instead of motorcycle gangs, the rich boys ride their daredevil bikes up the high stories of construction sites.If you know anything about Beijing, it is a city of millions of bikes, swarming like taxis in New York.  Most are for simple transporation to and from work and shopping, but some are used to transport multiple birdcages and even mattrasses.  One bike is shown failing to support a refrigerator! The camera is everywhere, recording the waves of bicycles amid the swarms of automobiles, from ground-level up, through flashing spokes and chains, to panoramic views from above.  The camera shows the poor neighborhoods with newcomers brushing their teeth in the street, even sharing a toothbrush, as well as the interior of posh hotels, where the hapless bicycle messenger must undress completely and take a shower in order to deliver a message to a Mr. Zhou.  We find Mr. Zhou getting a comically assisted workout by the masseur and he is not the right Zhou.  There are many Zhou's in China! `Try Zhou Yimou' is the inside joke, as that is the name of the director's mentor, the Great Zhou.The bicycle messenger is a stubborn lad from the country and gets caught in a revolving door and into the machinations of the new posh living, and thus we are caught in the never-ending struggle between wealth and poverty, sophistication and ignorance.  No need to go into the details of the story--- suffice it to say it is a gripping one, a coming together of age-old irresolveable conflict, that of young men looking for romance and poor people looking for a better life.  As we observe the young men, struggling with inborn instincts of sex and aggression, there is sure to be shock, pain, bloodshed and important lessons learned.

He is also clearly influenced by Italian Neo-realism as evidenced by the plots much noted similarity to De Sicca's Bicycle Thief. The other clear influence is the work of Taiwanese long shot auteurs like Tsai Mian-liang and Hou hsiao hsien. This combination of influences has created a style which some have proclaimed innovative but which to a seasoned viewer of world cinema is derivative, generic and actually shot in a very workmanlike style without any particular framing ability, brio or gift for mise en scene.The premise of this movie could have led to an interesting examination of modern china, but the writers seemed unable to find any realistic way to bring about this premise. Once the relationship between country boy and city poor is established the contrast between their lives is not used to say or show anything of interest but instead the director opts for fallacious pieces of symbolism to show their innate similarity.The movie has been praised for gritty realism in showing the life of the Chinese poor, but it is actually incredibly false. The beijing of this movie is too clean, too bright, too picturesque and would appear to only have about ten people living in it. The movie also cops out by having every single character speaking putonghwa - very unlikely.Finally, the acting is poor and unnaturalistic and every plot point drawn out for melodramatic effect. This must be the most over-rated piece of world cinema i've ever seen. Instead of following the herd to this tosh watch the true leaders of the sixth generation.

In fact, we suspect this director is telling a story that seems to mirror the other film, but it's Chinese to the core.Young Guo, who has arrived in Beijing from a rural area, is hired as a messenger for an agency that delivers important packages and mail throughout the city. Part of the deal is a shiny new bicycle that will be paid by the new hires after being in the job for a while. The bicycle for Guo means the improvement of his lot in life, as well as freedom to go everywhere and be his own master.Jian, on the other hand, is a student that is seen hanging out with a rough bunch of school mates. Jian is excelling academically, but in order to fit, he must have a bicycle. The film doesn't make clear if Jian himself steals the bicycle, or as he claims, he bought it at the second hand market, with the money he stole from his father, which seems to be the case. He views the bicycle as a sign of status and of belonging; a means to have been accepted by his peers. Young Guo shows a stubbornness that seems to be a trait with people from the area where he comes from. Instead of accepting the fact that his bicycle has been stolen, he decides to investigate on his own, something that must be a super human task given the millions of bicycles one sees in that city, and a mode of transport for the masses. One can't follow Guo's logic in not going to the police, or when he realizes who has stolen his bicycle, he never challenges the thief. In fact, Jian and his friends show a cruelty for the newly arrived country bumpkin that is scary. In fact, Jian shows a stubbornness himself that is unusual for a city boy that should have known better and who should have realized the plight of Guo.Beijing Bicycle shows a side of city living in a city that is crowded and can be cruel to anyone trying to make a life in a decent way. We watch at the end a defeated Guo walking with his mangled bicycle on his way back home, perhaps.The film will not disappoint, in spite of some repetitious sequences thanks to the strength of the two principals and the direction by Xiaoshuai Wang.

I believe that Westerners in general, and Americans in particular , tend to gloss over these disparities in worldview, especially since the emergence of Deng's capitalism with Chinese characteristics has resulted in greater superficial similarity. In The Bicycle Thief, to which this film is automatically compared, there is an overriding sense of right and wrong, of justice violated and restored, of higher purpose -- all consistent with Western philosophy, from ancient Greece to modern Christianity. In Beijing Bicycle contrariwise the persistent theme, overt and implied, is that of joss, luck or fate. There is no implied necessity that misdeeds will be punished, that good will triumph, or that there will be any closure to matters at all. Over and above being entertaining, I would recommend this movie as required viewing for those engaged in commerce and diplomacy with our Eastern brethren.

It's pacing was effective and helped add poignancy to the film, and quite frankly I cannot think of too many scenes that could have been dropped without losing a certain something in the film.My one big problem with this film is how many reviewers seem to be commenting on its anthropological insights rather then plot devices itself. Yes, as a study of modern (and changing) china it is a fascinating.  Yet, many sixth wave chinese films do the same, setting the scenes in an urban environment but looking at it through the eyes of those who cannot partake in all of its luxuries.  Thus, looking at it from only this angle hardly does a film justice as it doesn't explain why the film could be well-received by chinese viewers, or anyone already familiar with the ongoing changes on mainland china.What I personally took out of the film was how thoroughly cruel humans could be to each other.  Yet, this cruelty wasn't the sort found in state repression or religious persecution, rather, it was a cruelty that came about through ordinary people making what in many ways were ordinary decisions.Some spoilers aheadTo illustrate my point it is not out of the ordinary for high school boys to try to look out for each other.  In that one scene by the rail tracks where that one biker is showing off his skills to a crowd, the group of students do call each other brother and obviously think of themselves as having a strong bond.  Thus, it is easy to believe that they could painfully beat Guo in trying to get their friends stolen bike back.  Similarly, in the scene in the bathhouse where Guo quite accidentaly receives a shower and is horrified to see that he has to pay, the young woman working the register insists that he pays for the services rendered.  In both these instances, the viewer knows just how thoroughly damaging these actions were on the pitiful Guo, yet the anatagonists remain largely ignorant.  For the gang of boys they are merely protecting their friend, for the receptionist she is just doing her job.In both of these instances, and in many more like it spread throughout the film, the director and screen writer seem to be showing the audience the devastating consequences that seemingly normal decisions can have upon others, and how such wanton cruelty can be delivered quite unintentionally. All of this in my mind make this such a tragic and sorrowful film, challenging those who've watched it to re-examine many aspects of their own lives.

This goes on back and forth until they come to a compromise, but a climatic ending ensues when a third party comes into the picture and destroy both of their dreams.I found this movie very provoking, touching on subject of modern china, where in the case of the rural migrant, his livelihood depended on the bicycle, while for the kid that took it, it is a vanity item that is a must have in order to be cool and get the girl.  Such a basic item having such different meaning to each of these individual.  The extraordinary step each one takes to get the bike, from roaming the streets for days looking at each and every one of the millions of bikes out there, to the stealing of the parents money that was meant for the daughter's tuition, shows how desperate each member of the society is willing to go through to survive in this big city in their own way.It highlights the plight of migrants and their desires to climb up the ladder of modern china, one minute brushing their teeth with their finger in the streets, the next, spying on a girl in a high rise apartment that is trying on different dresses, who turns out to be another peasant migrant working as a maid, trying out her employer's dresses behind her back.The ignorant stubbornness is show here again, much like the character in `Not One Less', where they refuse to give up, but at the same time, don't know what actions to take.  So what they end up doing is not progressing forward or backward, basically in a standstill.  It must be a rural type of characteristics.Even the ending signifies how the modern world provides inequities, no matter how much you try, with the kid's girlfriend being wooed away by another biker who knows how to perform greater tricks, the kid, being a city kid, does not take the ignorant stubbornness approach, instead goes for the ill-thought confrontational path, only to have revenge taken upon him and the rural migrant by the other biker and his bully gang, resulting in them being beaten up and the bike, which the two have come to share, be destroyed.

So far, we're in a Chinese version of Bicycle Thieves and Guo's desperation is the same of the main character in De Sica's film, but it soon gets contrasted with another kind of desperation, as the bike falls into hands of Jian, a lower middle-class kid for whom the bike represents a status-symbol, a way to climb in rank among his peers and to impress the prettiest girl of his class. To lose the bike would mean social death, a concept alien to Guo, for whom losing the bike means possible starvation.
