The actual heist is so complicated that the desired tension sags earlier than it should. Heist has nothing of the suspense of a Hitchcock thriller, and trying to outwit your opponent gets boring after a while when you start forgetting what it is all about. There are some nice scenes around the airport though, some memorable dialogue (everybody needs money, that's why it's called money), and it's always fun to watch great professionals like Hackman, Rockwell and DeVito. Mamet's stock actor Ricky Jay adds flavour to the movie as usual, Rebecca Pigeon's part was ungrateful to play and somehow superfluous.Hackman and his boys are doing The Swiss Job. Some old and newer clichés of my country pop up, viewers here were amused. And, believe me, the Swiss are always pleased when someone across the Atlantic acknowledges their mere existence, in whatever way this is done.

Master thief Joe (Hackman) decides to call it quits after a profitable jewel store robbery in which his unmasked face is caught on camera. Trouble is, he's already committed to another, bigger job--stealing a gold shipment from a Swiss freight plane--for his fence & paymaster Mickey (Devito). Mickey won't pay off for the jewel job until Joe does the Swiss thing. The film's first big flaw is that the animosity between Joe & Mickey, who are apparently longtime friends & associates, is never explained enough to justify why they are so willing to stick it to one another. This is a problem because Hackman's character is supposed to occupy the moral high ground (always important when everybody's a criminal) but, in the story, comes across at least as treacherous as Devito's. Fine portrayals by Hackman & Devito cover up rather than diminish this flaw. From then on it's all one twist after another, not all of which twist without leaving open holes behind. Will Joe do the job and, if so, end up doing it the way Mickey wants? Does Joe's supercool, Impossible-Mission crew (Lindo, Jay & Pigeon) trust him & stick with him all the way? Is Mickey's brash young nephew & protégé Jimmy (Rockwell), whom Mickey sends to watch Joe, really as cluelessly macho as he seems? Joe's heist plans (cute as a pailful of kittens) are too complicated to work unless His Honor Judge Murphy is too sleepy to enforce his law. But they provide a marvellous venue for Mamet to work the lost magic of Welles & Hitchcock developing characters through interaction & dialog. The supporting cast carries most of this task & does it very well, particularly thieves Lindo, Rockwell & Jay. Jimmy's pushy questions to the other thieves are met by cool, obfuscating questions in reply (How long's he been with that girl? How long is a Chinaman's name?). Pigeon is suitably hard-edged for this taut film, but a lone actress surrounded by so many tough actors has to bring something extra to stand out. Though he'll probably be best remember for Hoosiers, and with respects to DeNiro in films such as Heat & The Score, Hackman is the most accomplished actor in films such as this, whether as a cop (The French Connection), a private-eye (Night Moves), a technician (The Conversation, Enemy of the State), a spy (Target) or even an attorney (Under Suspicion). He's the top master because he rarely fails to score, even in films with plot holes, weak premises & contradictions, with his strong & convincing characterizations, the almost insane passion that lurks just beneath his plain Midwestern veneer. Fine production values, understated but effective actions scenes & an above-average music score help Hackman & Co. make Heist a watchable rather than forgettable thriller. Enjoy the portrayals & action but don't think too much.

However Joe is never without a backup plan and double cross follows double cross.This really tries to be good &#150; it has a good sense of tough moodiness about it and has plenty of good lines and a top class cast.  However it tries too hard to be a twisty crime thriller and doesn't quite convince.  Where twists and double crosses are best is when they are unexpected and surprising.  Heist has so many `twists' that they lack impact or power.  Instead of being surprised we expect the next one to be only a few seconds away.  Although some of them are clever most of them lack the punch Mamet clearly wanted them to have.  That said it's still an enjoyable thriller but don't expect the plot to stand up in the cold light of day.As I said the cast are famous and all do well.  Hackman is grizzled but clever and can easily `do tough', Lindo is always good to watch but Ricky Jay seems out of place. I always find him easy to watch because he is naturally curious I think but his manner doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the cast.  DeVito and Rockwell are good.  It would be hard to compete in such a male driven plot and indeed Pidgeon struggles to get a character for herself.The cast do so well because Mamet is a good writer of dialogue &#150; even if he overdid the twists, lines are quotable, funny or just cool &#150; `My motherf****r is so cool when he goes to sleep sheep count him' or `don't you want to hear my last words?' &#150; `I just did'.  Even if the plot doesn't convince the direction, the dialogue and the cast make this better than the mess it should be.Overall it has good qualities, but the one driving force it needed was a much better story.

I know her demeanor is quiet and conniving, but she just struts around waiting to make overly witty replies. The rest of the cast were excellent, Delroy Lindo outshined Hackman as his right-hand thug, Ricky Jay pulls off the calm and collected badass, Sam Rockwell delivers a good presence that you just hate, DeVito was awesome as the break-your-balls bad criminal and Hackman played his part well as he always does. The story bored me however.  You knew what was going to happen before it happened and there were too many twists in the movie that they lost their affect.  Twists are good when used sparingly and when used at the right time.  I didn't like the timing of them in this movie or the overuse of them.  It got boring because the characters always pull something out of their hat when you least expect it. For me dialogue has to be  two things, witty and believable.  Now the dialogue in this film is witty, Mamet probably took a while to compile all these quotes into one movie, but it is too much.  It is simply to much.  All Rebecca Pidgeon says is these crafty responses and she engages no real conversation.  As for believable, people don't speak like this.

Here's why he played the character as Mamet most likely intended. We are used to seeing the bright sheen and slick attitude of movie con-men (Danny Ocean, Henry Gondorf, et al) and any offering less suave is not well received. Joe was an aging has-been. The film alludes to his down-slide the whole time. He gets burned, loses his take and gets forced into another thing. Bobby even voices this explicitly to him when he walks out on the thing. **side note Bobby obviously was putting on the dog and pony show for Jimmy when he said those things, but they still have merit as I'll explain**So, why am I under the opinion G.H. did a better job then most give him credit for? Joe was down and out- supposedly weak in the game and broke. He had to keep up this illusion to successfully allow everyone else (but Bobby and Pinky) to under-estimate him. He also feared there was probably validity to his supposed weakness. He musters his talent to execute a great heist and dodge the complications. Essentially, Gene Hackman had to play a character who was descending into age and loss, gathering his talents for the thing and dealing with betrayal, have the confidence in himself but also the fear of his lameness, and put on a front that he was a foolish has been. He did not play him weak, but played the has-been with doubt who thinks he can pull it off but keeps a 'lame' front. The layered complexity of the character was portrayed by G.H. very well but lost on those who fail to see it.

His method is simple and consistent explore the ambiguity between a reality and a presentation of that reality, and to do so through the fine, immediate granularity of dialog rather than character or plot.His past films have been various takes on this same issue, only the outer form changing, from a multilevel 42nd Vanya to an extended cover for a lie (Winslow) to a film about making a film (State). Here the device is an old one the scam. In the convention, the smart guy (and we know immediately who he is) has everything figured out. Such stories are a sort of reverse mystery -- the hero has already understood events and the viewer experiences the extended revelation.In this convention, the genius of the hero in anticipating events is sacrosanct. And because we are seeing the mystery in expositional form, the camera must remain stationary and remote as if it were a theater patron. And that's where Mamet turns everything on its head. Anyone who thinks this movie is anything at all like `the Score' or `Entrapment' should have their license to watch films revoked.The first reverse is mechanical. Until now, Mamet's work has been strikingly conventional so far as the stance of the camera. All his prior stuff has placed the viewer squarely in his or her theater seat. But here, where the form demands just that approach, he decides to make his camera dance. He grabs P T Anderson's camera guy and makes the camera a character. It's not fully masterful, but it is very clever sometimes we are `gathered' with one group of conspirators, sometimes with another. Mamet's intent throughout is to not only shift the truth, but shift the perspective of the truth as well.The second way he messes with the form is that the plan falls apart at every turn. The hero hasn't scoped out everything, he's just agile enough to have lots of backups. But this guy hardly wins, which is what the form usually demands. He gets shot. His friend gets killed. He loses his lovely young sexy wife, even his boat. This is unlike the `Spanish Prisoner' which was a sterile scam that unfurled according to plan.. This one is fraught with chance, error and human unpredictability. The entertaining part is that even after a couple viewings, you can't tell which is which which is plan, which error -- which intended red herrings, and which just abandoned intent.Mamet usually works with actors who play multiple dimensions at once. But here he picks a different lot actors who are obvious. That is, we are always conscious that they are playing a part. He exploits this weakness to blend with the same weakness of the characters who themselves are obvious actors, (I doubt Hackman knows he's being goofed on.) Two exceptions First, Devito is one of the most intelligent men in Hollywood if not the best actor. He plays the shill, which is yet another reversal.The other exception is Ms Rebecca. In past outings Mamet has carefully written her part as an act of love, even sex. Here, he assumes too much. Many plot turns depend on her sexual opportunism, on her balanced scheming. Much revolves around her pulling this off, and he is so smitten that he assumes we have the same vision of her that he does, (See how Orson Welles similarly missed with his wife Rita in `Shanghai.')Though pretty, she just isn't up to this central role. For some reason, I think Jennifer Jason Leigh would have been able to have the requisite conniving moistness.

The plot is pretty good, and keeps your interest throughout. There are a fair bit of double-crosses throughout, and near the end, it does get somewhat tiresome. The acting is all top-notch. Not one performance was even slightly off. It's no surprise to see such high-quality acting from Hackman, Lindo and Rockwell, but I had not expected such excellent performances from DeVito and Jay. The writing is very good, but Mamet uses too many clichés and there's just a tad too much going on in the shadows, people conspiring against each other. The dialog tries oh so hard to be clever, and occasionally succeeds, but more often than not, it just comes off as pretentiousness, with all the slang, the attempts at being clever and the ridiculously high pace it sometimes sports. The cinematography is great, not one shot was poor or out of place. The pacing is mostly good, though the film seems to go on just a bit too long.

It stars Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito, Delroy Lindo, Sam Rockwell, Rebbecca Pidgeon and Ricky Jay. Music is by Theodore Shapiro and cinematography by Robert Elswit. Joe Moore (Hackman) and his small band of thieves are coerced into taking on one last big job by their shifty fence Mickey Bergman (DeVito). But when Bergman's nephew Jimmy Silk (Rockwell) is sent along on the heist with them, it could prove to be a recipe for disaster?The one last job theme is a familiar plot device in many a crime and noir picture, but as Mamet proves here, it can still remain fresh if given its own sheen. Divisive amongst Mamet's fans and seen as a lesser light in the director's neo-noir output, Heist improves greatly upon a second viewing. In fact it holds up as a clinically executed piece of noirish cinema, it's smart, crafty and laced with essence of cool.You're a piece of work!I came all the way from China in a matchbox.Structured around twists and tricks, where nothing is ever as it seems - including the wonderfully ambiguous finale - Heist positively thrives on the snap, crackle and pop of Mamet's dialogue, dialogue that comes trickling off the tongues of characters whose loyalties/dis-loyalties are never 100% certain. Quite often what is being said is in clipped format, where the meaning is different to what is actually being said, while visual exchanges, also, sometimes mean more than it appears at first glance. Make no bones about it, this is no ordinary caper movie, it's labyrinthine in plotting and the director toys with the conventions of the formula.My MOFO is so cool when sheep go to bed they count him!Visually Mamet and DOP Elswit keep the colours smooth, but they do throw in some interesting angles and use smoky lenses to accentuate the possibility of cloudy means and motives. Acting performances are mostly excellent. Hackman underplays it perfectly as a world weary crim who may or may not be one step ahead of the game? Lindo is muscular and cool, Jay a stoic side-kick, DeVito slimy and Pidgeon (Mamet's wife) provides layers as the fulcrum femme. Only real disappointment comes with Rockwell as the poisonous adder in the thieves nest. A few years away from becoming the great actor he is now, Rockwell here lacks a dangerous dynamism, a raw sexuality to really make the integral character work to its potential.Elsewhere there's flaws, such as the key heist involving an aeroplane that stretches credibility to breaking point; a shame since the opening robbery that introduces us to the characters is brilliantly constructed, and the big shoot-out scene lacks the energy to really raise the pulse; but even within that scene is a great moment as DeVito's Mickey Bergman, in amongst the flying bullets, shouts out the question why can't we just talk?, why indeed? You see, in Mamet's badly under valued neo-noir, talk is everything.

Trouble is, he sounds like that all the time, and in other scenes, he is really exposed.      But the real star of the movie is Mamet himself, that is, his wannabe dialogue that aspires to the cornball cleverness of something like Sweet Smell Of Success.  Some of the lines are funny (everybody needs money, that's why they call it money), others clunk with a heavy thud and you just cringe with embarrassment.  Try these on for size     Nobody lives forever.      Frank Sinatra gave it a try.      OR     My MF's so cool, when he goes to sleep, sheep count him.  OR     Cute plan though.

In the plane they unload the washers from the Foundry container to the getaway van (to fool the nephew) and move the gold into the Foundry containers so they can pick it up later in the day. This is shown by the fact that a small container was already on the floor when the cut the lock on the Swiss container. BUT... when they are melting the gold later on, the Foundry labels are shown covering on the Swiss containers.The bad guys have the actual Swiss containers with different labels on them. The bad guys seem to bring labels on the plane with them (in the thermos). But by this scenario they wouldn't get relabeled Swiss containers, they'd get their own containers back with the gold moved into it. That doesn't work.One of us thinks they used a custom agent and freight agent (talked about but never shown) to relabel the containers BEFORE the heist takes place.

If you've ever seen a heist movie you know that nothing can go that simply, and that there are going to be twists and turns along the way, in this case, a LOT of twists and turns. So many, in fact, that by the end you'll have long stopped caring.If you're in anything less than a great mood it is almost impossible to follow the sheer number of twists, back-stabbings, double-crosses and dead-ends that unfold in the course of the heist. Characters are developed only insomuch as they are essential to the job at hand, so I found myself wondering just WHO these people are, as well as the frustration that characters' motivations are never fully explained. As in any heist film if you examine the plan through a microscope you see it can only survive in movie-world... the real world is not a hospitable environment for this type of intricate, precision-timed professionalism. There are bits of dialogue that you could call neo-noir, or David Mamet at his worst, or just garbage, and even the great actors here cannot always triumph over the clunky, chunky, sometimes mystifying language that the characters speak. (PINKY You wanna know how cool my friend is? When he goes to sleep at night, sheep count HIM.) By the time you reach the final frame you will have been through more twists than Chubby Checker and more U-turns than a parade detour... you might find yourself standing and screaming at your TV, possibly inventing new profanity as you go.Who talks like this? Danny DeVito is shouting into the phone Everybody needs money- that's why they call it MONEY! Do these people eat or sleep or even resemble any humans you've ever met? Evidently they're up all night every night dreaming up clever one-liners and plotting to stab each other in the back to steal each other's gold. Where the hell does the boat guy go? He drives off into the night with his gun and sack of cash and falls off the face of the Earth? What the hell is Patti Lupone, Evita herself, doing as a boozebag rent-a-cop in an aborted sub-plot that is as pointless as it is hilarious?Hackman is supposedly a master-thief at the end of his career and he has NOTHING? No money, no nest egg, no security net even though he's the most-prepared craftsman in the history of cinematic crime? What about the auto-mechanic who gets out of his tow truck and walks casually up to two policemen with shotguns drawn on a kneeling suspect 'Somebody here call for a ride?' These hard-boiled noir characters are so serious, so savage, that you may very well laugh at their antics.On the plus side the movie, like Joe's heist, is masterfully planned to the very last frame, and we don't see movies like this anymore... a nod to classic film-noir and tough-cookie characters who have no need for a soft side. The movie keeps you guessing... you are never ahead of the plot, and unlike many other con-artist/heist movies Mamet never makes the mistake of scamming his audience. (Matchstick Men, anyone?) Hackman, DeVito & Lindo are all solid, but Sam Rockwell's Jimmy is a desperately-needy low-key psychotic trying without much success to pass as cool. (Has Sam Rockwell ever played anything ELSE?) After a final shot which raises as many questions as it answers, I found myself too numb to care what happened to the characters... the open-ended finale is Mamet's easy way to avoid committing.If he doesn't care why should we?GRADE C "},{"Title":"Find the Gold in this Picture.","Date":"1 June 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" This would be a rather standard heist/double cross movie if it weren't for the fact that the dialog has Mamet's ink spilled all over it.I mean, look at this plot. A tired old gunslinger, I mean thief, wants to get enough money to retire to South America and get a sun tan with his girl friend (Hackman and Pigeon, respectively). To do it, he's forced to cooperate with a bunch of hoods (DeVito, Lindo, Rockwell, and Jay) and pull off one last spectacular heist of a gold shipment from Switzerland. The heist itself is complicated and exciting.The double crosses start immediately afterward and, this having been written by Mamet, the double crosses lead to triple and quadruple crosses. Maybe quintuple, I lost count. It ends up with one of the good guy dead, and two of them surviving and securing the gold.Gene Hackman is always reliable, and Ricky Jay with that big porous nose is like somebody we all know and like. Rockwell is suitably slimy. Danny DeVito I prefer to see in comic roles. Delroy Lindo has a face that belongs on Mount Rushmore and an acting style to match. Rebecca Pigeon is not given much to do except walk around and look sexy, which is just fine.The conventions are surprisingly conventional here. A bop on the head with a gun puts a character out for just exactly as long as the plot requires. A real bop would be more likely to stun the victim for a few seconds or put him in the hospital with a concussion. And there is a wild shootout at the end.Mamet's direction is functional and straightforward. He saves all his razzle dazzle for the dialog which varies from the elliptical to the inane. She's cute, isn't she? As a Chinese baby. It's a well organized film, though it has holes in the plot. Some of the situations I still haven't figured out. But it's engaging and keeps a viewer involved, and the locations in Montreal and Vermont and Cape Ann are marvelously evoked. In those latitudes there is a refreshing omnipresent crispness in the air even at mid day and the sun is so near the horizon that it seems to turn the sea and everything else silver rather than gold. I recall waking up in the back seat of my car, near Sault Ste. Marie, after midnight hearing all the dogs of nearby farms howling and the sky ablaze with Northern Lights. In the middle of July. Spooky stuff, but there's none of that in this film, which focuses on the much spookier subject of human ethics.

Also, in an age where (thanks in no small part to Mamet himself) the double-cross movie has become ever more popular, there appears to be a kind of inflation in the genre where each film has to out-do its predecessors in tricksiness, so that 'Heist' contains rather more twists than is strictly necessary.  Overall, the effect is not dissimilar to 'Ocean's Eleven', although without that film's irritating star-worship. 'Heist' is always entertaining, and Rebecca Pidgeon does a sexy turn, but given Mamet's pedigree, its still disappointing superior product, but in no way art.

I consider myself to be somewhat well read and I think it only helped me to identify just how odd-ball Mamet's dialogue really is.  At one point Devito calls Pidgeon a doxy, the last person to even use that obscure term was Rex Stout in 1966.  An insult loses a good deal of its thrust if it isn't understood.  In another scene Delroy Lindo states that they are going to see the elephant, that ladies and gentleman...you can look this up...is civil war slang.  I think Mr. Mamet fell victim to his own press and reached very deeply into the dialogue bag to meet the standards set for him.

In the next film Mr. Mamet please try to avoid any more antebellum dialogue.  You have my blessing to watch the Heist but don't expect it to fundamentally change you.

Lindo could be the new DeNiro for his Walk Away speech.  Pidgeon was never developed as a character (if anything, she was split between devoted spouse and slut-for-hire) and we saw that in the first MissionImpossible already. Be that as it may, the plot was so bizzarely contrived that it made this year's earlier offering by DeNiro/Brando/Norton look plausible.  At least with that film there was a moderate level of plot twists even though it was the same Old buddy forces hero to do one-more-job and you must take my protoge' with you and they admitted to filming in Canada.  But there is just one completely unbelieveable coincidence or situation after another 1. Obviously filmed before 9-11 but still no airport would allow a jet to be unloaded on a working runway and not get someone out to look at Whazzup? even then. 2. No police department (supposedly Logan here with Mass. State Police) would allow vehicles to leave the area after an explosion.  In addition, no crates from the victim aircraft could be picked up until all contents were checked and cleared by police and prosecutors. 3. Though they used what appeared to be authentic Mass. State Policecars and uniforms (and Mass. S.P. does patrol Logan) the troopers wore their badges above the pocket like LAPD and NYPD whereas real Mass. troopers wear theirs on the left pocket flap. 4. What's with Pidgeon??? Spoilers Follow!!!!Loves Hackman but then shtupps the punk.  Runs away from punk when he finds washers, but leaves with him after dock scene.  Gets beaten during interrogation scene but double crosses Hackman and finally finds true love with Punk? And if she really knows Hackman, she ought to know to test the pipes before heading into the sunset.  OK, sure, there are weird relationships and lovers that turn against each other, but she spins in place. 5. With the exception of Batman (Look a shark! Well, Robin, I've got shark repellent in my utility belt) no one has had so many conveniently placed back-ups.  Lindo on the boat w/shotgun at the ready, extra pick-up truck, phony pipes on first pick-up, fake gold railings, wife willing to sleep with the enemy, Customs Officer just happens to be at bar and then just happens to be a Roach Coach and then just happens to fortify coffee and then just happens to disappear so as not to notice a change in guard, etc. Patti Lupone deserved better. 6. Hackman gets shot in the back of the thigh and limps?  How about a shattered femur?  Lindo and Hackman are Baranaby Jones shots with handgun and shotgun but bad guy with Ruger Mini 14 can't hit a thing? Oh, Come on! 7. And what of Frecce???  Is he a mobster or what?  He is going to get his gun stolen and not be back to whip a Comuppance on Hackman? 8. Hackman and Lindo melt down the gold apparantly at the Boat Shop.  How hard is it for DeVito and Frecce to find them? 9. The final gold pipes in the truck (first of all they would have been gold rods due to the rudimentary forge)were obviously machined and above what they were doing.  Each drop of spilled gold was worth something and no one seemed concerned. 10. Last, but not least, gold is phenominally heavy, more than lead, and any serious volume of gold will bottom out a conventional truck. 11. Logan Airport is in a much more urban setting and not the rolling countryside depicted.  The Bangor-Brewer airport in Maine looks more like the Canadian filming location.Other than that, it was believable.

The obviously high level of trust and understanding that they share, enable them to cope when things don't go exactly as planned and to improvise well whenever the need arises. The pace and precision of what happens in these opening scenes is impressive and intriguing and sets the tone for everything that follows. Numerous plot twists, double-crosses and humorous moments then add to the fun as the plot becomes increasingly complicated and the gang have to cope with some unexpected challenges.When veteran thief and gang-leader Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) accidentally has his picture captured on a security camera during a high-value jewellery robbery, he knows that the most sensible course of action is to retire immediately and head south on his boat with his much younger wife Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon). He encounters a problem, however, when his fence and financial backer Mickey Bergman (Danny DeVito) opposes the plan because he's already invested a large sum of money in setting up the gang's next job. Bergman isn't willing to make any concessions and withholds the gang's share of the proceeds of the robbery to force them into carrying out the Swiss thing.The Swiss thing turns out to be an extremely dangerous but highly lucrative robbery of a huge shipment of gold from a Swiss cargo plane. To make matters worse, however, the distrustful Bergman stipulates that his nephew Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell) has to go along as one of the gang to ensure that they go ahead with the heist exactly as planned. Silk is young, inexperienced and impulsive and also has designs on Fran. He sees Joe as an old guy who's losing his grip and soon starts to think of how he could get away with both the gold and the girl.Joe feels compelled to go ahead with the gold heist and although he has complete faith in the loyalty and professionalism of his right-hand man Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo) and his diversionary expert Pinky (Ricky Jay), the on-going presence of Jimmy Silk continues to be a source of great concern even after the ambitious heist has been successfully carried out.David Mamet's style of direction is perfect for this material as he brings great coherence and momentum to the intricate plot and his dialogue, as usual, is sharp, witty and quite unique. Some clever quips and brilliant banter illuminate the exchanges between the main characters but the usual formality and stilted nature of Mamet's lines are less apparent in this movie, possibly due to the presence of Gene Hackman. His skillful delivery is so warm and natural that it makes even the most contrived phrases sound quite spontaneous and his interactions with Delroy Lindo are a real highlight. Both actors excel in this movie as do Ricky Jay and Danny DeVito who also make their characters very real.The high quality of the direction, the writing and the acting ensure that a higher-then-average rating is merited but what's probably even more impressive is the way in which Mamet has taken a very simple and familiar plot and developed it into an enjoyable thriller that actually gets better with each repeat viewing. In the case of Heist, once is definitely not enough.

In that particular episode a quite ridiculous plot line unfolded about a lone passenger in a small business jet (apparently a single-pilot Cessna Citation, thankfully; almost all civil jets require at least a 2-pilot flight crew) with a dead or profoundly incapacitated pilot, much to my dismay. It would have been easy to make it almost half-way plausible simply by asking a professional pilot (I'm available for a reasonable fee) for a little input; or, better yet, opting for a different plot contrivance. I'm eschewing a full critique-- but trust that it's extensive.Aside from the oh-so-common glaringly erroneous and lazily contrived depiction of aviation in this episode of The Unit, it seems unlikely and publicity-risky for a deep-black government agency to eliminate one of its own (the passenger) by creating collateral damage in the process-- especially when there are so many other, and easier/less costly and more certain ways to cause someone to die in an accident. The above silliness reminded me of Mr. Mamet's wacky idea in Heist of (if I remember correctly) incapacitating the 3-member crew of a Boeing 727 freighter with gas while their pressurized quick-donning oxygen masks (designed to eliminate smoke inhalation and work above 24000 feet cabin pressure altitude) are hanging right next to them... and all while still on the ground! I forget the rest of the preliminary and ensuing nonsense, but I'm sure there were several other off-putting grossly inaccurate, yet typical off-the-shelf aviation depictions, obviously sans technical advice.

There are so many great lines in this movie it's impossible to recite them all here. The directing is great. Mamet knows the genre very well.The acting by Gene Hackman is the tops. Here's a guy that is such an old pro he can take any role you give him and turn it into something great. This is not to say that the part of Joe Moore is uninteresting. It most certainly isn't! Danny De Vito is surprisingly good in this film. At first I thought, this guy is all wrong for this movie. The part he's playing is an old-fashion tough-guy villain.

People tend to think that she's out of place in a Mamet film. Some think she delivers the lines wrong. Though I've never thought this of her, this is her best role! She reminds me of a modern, hip Veronica Lake, Barbara Stanywick type of femme fatal. She is just as good has Hackman in this movie.

This time I could anticipate the twists.Mamet regulars Rebecca Pigeon and Ricky Jay are joined by Gene Hackman as Joe Moore, the head of a crew of jewel thieves. He takes on a big heist for his difficult partner Mickey Bergman (Danny DeVito), but he has been identified on a previous job and is saddled with Bergman's impulsive son. Heist continues David Mamet's fascination with long and short cons, tells, marks and grifts. But like Joe Moore, Mamet has been made from a previous job and now we are ready for him &#x96; we've ramped up our security.The film has a better first half and looks good. It also has a pacey score by Theodore Shapiro that helps drive it forward. The big plus is Gene Hackman, his presence here makes up for shortcomings in other areas, especially the end. It also has Rebecca Pidgeon, her style takes some getting used to, but that watchfulness and reserve gives her an enigmatic quality &#x96; she steals scenes.Half the people in Mamet's films are cool &#x96; the others are marks. That controlling self-assurance verging on smugness worked well in House of Games but it gets a bit stretched here &#x96; it was definitely overstretched in Spartan.The film is loaded with distinctive Mamet speech patterns and rhythms &#x96; there are plenty of lines with a twist seeded throughout the film &#x96; My motherf#*ker's so cool, when he goes to bed, sheep count him.Heist does have tension, but in the end it paints itself into a corner and opts for a I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here resolution. Heist came out around the same time as The Score with Robert DeNiro. They were both heist films with attitude. The Score works better. Director Frank Oz had a light touch and The Score has wit and even empathy for its characters. To be honest, these are elements missing from Heist &#x96; it's cynical and it's clever, and there is irony, but humour can be the crucial difference in a movie such as this.If you are expecting a House of Games or a Homicide, Heist just doesn't get there, however it has its moments before it simply runs out of puff.

Or adapt Raymond Chandler's The Little Sister to the theatrical stage. Instead, he had to make a movie, and so he turned out this overcooked crime thriller. That doesn't mean Heist is unwatchable or even bad. Indeed, there's plenty of enjoyment to be had here. It does mean that Mamet needs to consider throttling back on the high level of contrivance that has come to infest almost every thing he does these days. Or else he needs to consider collaborating with another writer with a slightly more naturalistic approach to this kind of material. Don't get me wrong, I found plenty to like about Heist. Yeah, real people don't talk like this, and you can sense the script twisting itself into knots to provide the characters opportunity to deliver Mamet's trademark noir lines (which would work fine in a novel but require real work to deliver believably in a film). But Mamet quips are great quips (Everyone needs money...that's why they call it money.) and they are worth the work. But there is just too damn much of all the stuff Mamet usually does in Heist, and as a result, the movie is almost a lampoon of itself and of caper films in general. The plot strains the viewers' patience with twist after twist and betrayal after betrayal until the viewer just wants to get to the END OF THE FILM and figure out who finally won. And Mamet the director doesn't always have good judgment. Ricky Jay and Rebecca Pigeon are badly used in several scenes, where their body language and mannerisms display all the subtlety of a train wreck. In several shots Jay's on-the-scene signals and tells to his conspirators are so wooden and broad that he might as well be waving semaphore flags and yelling through a bullhorn IT'S TIME TO DO THE THING!!!!. Meanwhile Pigeon often seems to be channeling Veronica Lake (who was an extraordinarily wooden actress, BTW ) by way of Sharon Stone, and she smokes cigarettes as if she were a marionette. These are both good actors (bad actors don't make it into Mamet films), and they are fine in many other scenes, so I have to blame Mamet for poor direction in these rough spots. So Heist is not a classic. It's not even classic Mamet. But Mamet fans may enjoy it (as I did, even with all its hermeneutically sealed, airless atmosphere) for Hackman and Lindo and for the occasional memorable line. But I don't think it will win Mamet any new fans...in fact I think he is risking boring the fans he already has.

Although the combined resumes of the cast is very impressive and there are some great scenes within this film, it fails to reach any great heights after a dynamic opening scene.Hackman and Lindo play very interesting characters and De Vito is excellent, but for a number of reasons Heist just doesn't get going. Some of the dialogue is a bit odd to listen to, with the actors involved just being unable to deliver it naturally. With a bit of tweaking this wouldn't have been a problem, but there are too many times when the viewer is jarred by a line that sounds out-of-place. This is not due to the type of terminologies used; it is simply off-footed delivery with dialogue that knows it is clever and tries to come off that way. At other points the dialogue is spot-on and clever, making the film worthwhile.The capers are clever, but do rely on a large suspension of disbelief. It may be only the little things that are questionable, but in a heist film, where it is the twists that make the story interesting, a moment that ignores a logical reaction / event for the story's sake (to apparently make it more clever) is a moment that detracts from the story. Unfortunately this film contains a couple of moments where logical reactions are played down so the caper can go off cleanly. This doesn't kill the enjoyment to be gained from Heist, but it does detract from the overall effect of the film.Finally, Heist possibly loses out on some interesting characterisation for Hackman's character. He is going for the big last take and could be considered burned (no good) by others on the heist. He may be clever, but he is also wanted by police and getting old. If the aged criminal/s angle had been played up a big more it could have improved Heist. Instead some characterisation is sacrificed to make room for more caper action, which means the viewer is a bit indifferent to the characters in the movie.Heist has been compared to The Score and Ocean's Eleven. Although all are caper movies, they are different creatures. Ocean's Eleven is all flashy style over substance; cool characters who everyone likes and hope to see win. The Score adds a generational angle to a caper, with the talented young criminal versus the retiring older criminal in a battle of wits. The importance in The Score is over who wins, not what they win. Heist is more about the aged criminals who have been scamming for years and are trying to get away with one final score, yet unable to give up without making that score. Greed is the primary motive of all the characters; unfortunately they remain a bit two-dimensional because of it.Heist is a smart film that has several moments that make it worth watching. Unfortunately it never really gets up a pace that would make it interesting. A lack of characterisation makes the viewer not care about any of the characters and the repeated double-crosses only serve to lessen the impact of the next narrative twist. Overall Heist is worth watching, but probably only once.

Obviously, it's another heist movie (hence the title), but I think what reveals the movie's true character the in the most direct fashion is the beginning sequence with the studio logos, ect. Review this chunk of film and you'll notice that the modern logos have been rendered in black/white and bastardized into an early 50's? (perhaps 30's) version. So not only is it a strong genre piece, its also drawing from elements in film noir and replicating (in a modern way) style elements from those early criminal films. Some people are alienated by the unrealism of the dramatic and dynamic dailogue in this film. But, if characters in movies talked like real people do, a sitcom would last from dinner until the eleven o'clock news and you'd have to take vacation time to see a full-length film. Additionally, you have to look again to the period pieces that this film is emulating. The acting in this movie is beautiful, the soundtrack was designed with effect in mind, not marketing, and the cinematography is sound. In short, it's good. A highly entertaining and engaging movie.

Gene Hackman heads up a crew consisting of wife Rebecca Pidgeon, Delroy Lindo and Ricky Jay who pull complex jewel heists and then fence their loot through Danny DeVito. After their latest caper, which was to be Hackman's last, DeVito conspires for him to pull that one last job. In the process, he imposes his nephew (Sam Rockwell) on Hackman as part of the crew. Of course, no one trusts the other and all sorts of plot twists ensue leading up to the final showdown between Hackman and DeVito. Gene Hackman can still play that smiling confidence man as well as he ever could. He adds an air of what is he going to do next to the role. DeVito is also good as brutal villain with a sense of humor. Lindo and Jay complement Hackman as the male members of his crew and Pidgeon makes a sexy unpredicable wife. One thing that didn't make sense though was in the final shootout which takes place on a public pier. How come no one seems to hear the mayhem that is going on? And where are the police?

The plot was unclear from the advertisements but I like outlaw movies and the cast looked fantastic. Now that I have seen it, I can honestly say it was everything I hoped it wouldn't be, and more. Warning I am about to give the kind of pompous, self-important, wordy criticisms that I have always hated and never imagined I would use. It's hard for me to envision a script that makes Gene Hackman's acting seem stilted and off-tempo, but this one did it. The rest of the cast also seemed to be laboring under cut-and-paste dialog, jagged scene transitions, lack of smooth story flow and nonsensical plotting. The characters portrayed by Sam Rockwell and Rebecca Pidgeon were just lame. Dead, emotionless characters with absolutely no ability to evoke any kind of response from the audience (which was myself and my girlfriend). I couldn't even bring myself to dislike Rockwell's obviously made-to-hate character. Something else that crippled this movie was the undeveloped relationship between Hackman And Pidgeon. It's almost as if they threw the love interest part of the movie in as an afterthought. Compounding this problem is the total inappropriateness of the matchup. This is a problem that is currently running wild in American cinema (DeNiro and Melina Kanakaredes in 15 minutes, DeNiro and Bassett in The Score, Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment, etc). The movie tried to build suspense around the three-way relationship between Pidgeon, Hackman and Rockwell but it is poorly executed and we all know where she'll end up well before the movie ends. The single biggest problem in this movie is the incomprehensible story. For a good 80% of the movie, you simply have NO idea what the hell is going on. One minute the cast is here doing one thing, all of a sudden they are elsewhere doing something unrelated then BAM, they're back to the first place doing something unrelated to what they were doing there the first time around, all the while babbling incessantly about things that seem to have little or nothing to do with advancing the story. Gene Hackman is a fantastic actor, Danny DeVito is very good (quite underrated, I think), Ricky jay is always a great character and Sam Rockwell and Delroy Lindo can usually be counted on for solid, enjoyable performances. I shudder to think how this movie might have turned out with a less accomplished cast. As I stated earlier, I love outlaw movies but in this case I really didn't care at all whether or not they got away with it. I just wanted the movie to be over and hopefully have the ending explain things to me. It did not end soon enough and the ending was very weak, explaining nothing. For better examples of Mamet's work check out Glengarry Glen Ross, The Spanish Prisoner, Ronin or State and Main. The Heist is likely to leave you confused and unsatisfied.

All these things notwithstanding, I did enjoy this movie, mostly because of the cast, especially Hackman and DeVito, of course, but also Lindo and Jay.  Can I ask a dumb question?

If we look at some classic Mamet, and say that Homicide is about cops & robbers, or House of Games is about con games, we've failed to see the point in those stories. Homicide is about belonging, and House of Games is about accepting your darker nature.Heist is about friendship, loyalty, and the effect that things which drive us have. Love of gold? It is a poem about how, when faced with gold, or That Which We Want, we would give up, let's say, a girl -- and said girl, finding someone who seems to care about her, or seems more likely to get the gold, would betray loyalty for economic betterment.The relationship between Joe Moore and his co-protaganists are elegant. Love for his two trusted associates, and, as in The Edge, the way Joe sheds his 'better half' in light of admitting the vanity which motivated his union with her.In short, it is a beautiful story.Those of you who go to see Heist and expect to see Christ fall from the sky will not get their money's worth but those of you who enjoy a good bed-time fairy tale now and again will definitely not be disappointed.

The saving grace of this movie is a strong performance by the always-solid Gene Hackman.This dishonor among thieves flick shows more twists and turns in character development and makes it almost impossible to know who is on whose side until the end. The fact that everyone is a bad guy makes it interesting to choose the lesser of the evils. All of the characters have their prickly edges, but some do have likeable characteristics.

The weakest link - our latest cultural phenomenon - is illustrated by our bad guys (Hackman, et. al.) missing some detail and trumped by the badder guys (DeVito, et. al.) who, in turn, out dumb the former while the cycle continues.Our bad guys show most of the right stuff like humanity (sparing the life of an innocent who could implicate), loyalty (op. cit.), family (showing priorities when blood kin is threatened) and shrewdness (even in losing, they win).POSSIBLE SPOILER - Call me a sucker for a pretty lady but I don't think Joe's wife betrays him in the end. This film has a final reel not shown to the audience that clarifies the full story behind Fran's apparent betrayal. Otherwise she's out of Joe's loop and missed his potential escape that she knew so well. But then, I still argue that Cool Hand Luke lives on.This film is as fun to watch as a chess match. It won't be much fun if you don't get strategy and finesse. But when you do, you appreciate the masters.

It's an updated, refined, Mamet. An older, smoother, smugly wiser Mamet.  It still packs a punch, thanks to a strong cast which executes a decent script, but it's not like the old days. Even with the monosyllabic guy speak, the veiled references, and scene twists, this one fall a bit short.That's due in large measure to familiarity.  Heist is the same old story. Open the film showing our heroes on the job, in action.  But there's no victory in success for thieves.  Someone always wants more, while others always want out.  So, trouble ensues.  New challenges present themselves. Our protagonist might not be up to the job.  Plans change, again, real time, and yet, the primary plan seems to goes forward.  Remarkable, isn't it? Familiar, too.  Yeah.  It has that feel.But the feeling isn't so bad.Sure, it's steady and smooth Gene Hackman instead of steady and smooth Joe Mantegna.  It's composed Delroy Linda as an able #2, and Mamet regular character actor Ricky Jay as the perfect foil and mop up man.  But this crew is more than this trio, and this movie is not a stage play.  Add a young woman, tight with the fellas, and protected as the spouse of Hackman's character, and the new guy, thrown into the crew by financier and muscle man Danny Devito, and you're looking at your ingredients for the slow burn.Though not as rollicking as The Sting, or with as much sex appeal as the trailers for Ocean's Eleven promise, Heist works as a tale if you suspend disbelief about airport security at this point in time, if you accept that all women are fickle, and all older men wiser.The sexism Mamet has been criticized for in the past remains, though his attempt to tone it down, and make it cerebral, has the effect of highlighting it further.Check it out if you're looking for nuanced action, strategy, and mind games. It's not the House of Cards, and light years from Glengarry.  But it's still Mamet.

The major disappointment is the script, specifically the 'tough guy' dialogue which just doesn't ring true and ends up sounding contrived. The tough guy talk reminded me of the novels of George V Higgins (The Friends of Eddie Coyle etc) where the spoken exchanges look great on the written page but sound clunky and false out loud. The plotting is another major problem area - the planning for both heists is simply too complex and intricate to be believable. The success of the main heist, for example, is dependent upon a security officer with a alcohol problem snatching a drink at the exact moment when Gene Hackman happens to be standing next to her and then being gullible enough to hand her keys over to him. That said, Danny DeVito puts in a very good performance and has some very sharp lines, and Rebecca Pidgeon looks very sexy.

The plot, although an old one, was seemingly sound. The dialogue was funny and clever at times. But, in spite of a good cast, the story never flowed. The twists were contrived and seemed matter-of-fact rather than being a revelation. At times I struggled to catch the dialogue, because the quality of the sound seemed distorted. The music was OK, but this didn't help, as a few times I found myself listening to the tune, and not bothering to attempt to follow what was going on before my eyes.

As soon as you see Ricky Jay you know why he's in the picture. The trouble is that Mamet is so busy being convoluted that he forgets the core of a good successful  mystery it all has to make sense in the end.

In both cases, you've got the seasoned old pro thieves who would like to retire but get coerced or cajoled into doing one more big robbery. (Wasn't that the plot of Sexy Beast as well?) And the other all-too-hackneyed element is the cocky, young, unreliable wannabe who weasels his way into the team. And then of course the scenes in which it appears that some lowlife rival has stolen the sympathetic robbers' loot, but it turns out the goods have been switched and the double-crossing villains only got a bag full of scrap metal. Does it not ever occur to script writers that we've seen this all before?I will grant however that the dialogue in Mamet's movie was better than average for this genre. The actors were excellent, and the action was far more believable than what took place in The Score. You could almost imagine real-life robberies unfolding in this way, except for one thing Real-life robbers just aren't that bright as a general rule.Now, here's an even bigger spoiler.

Unfortunately, as someone already said, Mamet seems to have tried too hard. There isn't a *coolness* about it like there was with House of Games and Spanish Prisoner. Instead, it spent way too much time dealing with double/triple/quadruple/quintuple-cross, baiscally playing hot-potato with a whodunit story.

The men who make up the professional criminal's population are varied, with intelligence not required, but a brute determination to get a job done, get what you are after, and get away from the scene, a must for success and survival.Percentages are against heist-men, and Hackman's pro trouble-shooter Moore is becoming unusable the older he gets sooner or later, he's bound to be caught or killed. All the men in Moore's string, Lindo and Jay in particular, are muscle and legs for Moore's articulated plans, they carry it out in physical form while Moore plots his plan B for every conceivable occurrance. In this final blowout of his entire professional career, Moore uses all of his careful deceptions and manipulations as he attempts to rip off a Swedish gold shipment, avoid cops, and deceive the financing shark DeVito who won't let Moore quit the life.Many commentors on this movie seem confused by David Mamet's writing of these characters, but Mamet does a fabulous job of pointing out the operating mind-set of pro thieves, the violence of hard men working together to obtain a very clear goal, money, while staying out of prison. Mamet states this mind-set most clearly when Hackman's Moore refuses to kill a bank clerk during a robbery, a witness who can identify him, and yet when faced with other professionals who understand the rules and are trying to steal his money, Moore kills them without hesititation. This is part of the understanding among these men, and they accept it in order to survive.Outside of the Parker novels of Donald Westlake, this is one of the best views of the working relationship among heisters. The interactions are realistic; if Mamet fails, it's where he often fails, in the motivations and decisions of Moore's woman, Fran. Yet here Mamet does again show off a knowledge of a particular kind of woman in a particular kind of world. Fran comes across as a woman undergoing a conflict, based on her life up until now, her understanding of the rules in this world, that a woman is only as good as the criminal she's latched onto; caught in the situation with Moore, who is aging, and who must leave the country to avoid arrest, Fran is loyal up until the moment in which she doubts that Moore really loves her, that in fact he may only be using her as a tool...it's that conflict which makes Fran seem confused, a liability to the film itself. But Fran isn't a liability, and even though Moore trusts her, he makes sure he plans around the possibility of Fran betraying him. Always have a plan B, as Moore points out.HEIST is a well-executed, uncompromising crime film that isn't being cute with the characterizations, nor does it attempt to imbue the men with sympathy. Like most people, the men outside of the profession have women, some family, a boat, things they care about. It's the one weakness in all of them, that they are human, that gets them taken down in one form or another. Not being machines, the criminals, even pros, make mistakes. Joe Moore turns out to have even more weaknesses than some, but he compensates for them by figuring a way out, or around, the problems of being too-attached, too-trusting. In the end, Moore is a professional, and does whatever he has to to get the final payoff and escape. It's an effort of will that borders on divine, and Hackman makes the divine seem effortless.

A few fleeting impressions for what they're worth (1) MAMET DIALOGUE reminds me of a playwriting class I took over 20 years ago during which the prof liked to intone One thing people always do, they always do this they say everything twice, they say it twice.  Maybe Mamet took the same class. He takes this repetitive principle & goes nuts with it. Maybe it works on stage, but in the movies he's written, including the film version of his American Buffalo, eventually it calls attention to itself, & we're listening to a script instead of people talking.  Well, are we supposed to immerse ourselves in what's happening onscreen, or not?  If so, it's harder to do when the dialogue outshines the actors, especially when the characters are presented as criminals, lowlifes and/or ordinary joes, not witty professional intellectuals.  (2) Hackman and his gang are supposed to be cunning thieves, yet they keep doing stupid things for no other reason than to advance the plot, it seems.  During the 1st robbery, Hackman's face was filmed.  It wouldn't've mattered if he'd been wearing his mask. Why didn't he wear it?  Or the scene where they were pretending to be a road crew they were there so long, it never occurred to them a cop would stop to do a routine check?  What if the cop had checked their ID or asked for their office phone number?  They all would've been hauled down to the station for questioning, ending the movie, fortunately Rockwell flashed a gun precipitating a nice dramatic crisis, very cinematic & contrived.  Or the device of using the alcoholic woman to get in the door, that seemed extremely flimsy.  Hackman still had to slug somebody, how professional was that? But as someone pointed out, after a while we were just waiting for the next double-cross anyway, so it hardly seemed to matter.  Or the Swiss airplane sitting on the runway for eternity & a half with no one paying attention to it, etc. What if the pilot had simply chosen not to stop the plane? End of movie.  (3) NOIR IS DEAD, okay?  Noir doesn't work any more because this is no longer the 1940s.  Back in the 70s they were sending it up in movies like Slither.  Now they're trying to do it straight again. Give it up.  Goofiest scene in the movie Rebecca Pidgeon goes back to the bad bad guys on Hackman's instructions, the slimy idiot Rockwell hits on her & strips her dress off in one smooth move, fade out, we're led to conclude they had sex & she crossed over to them. Maybe this would've worked in 1946 in black & white with Kirk Douglas & Lizbeth Scott, but it seems incredibly sodding archaic now.  Sam Peckinpah had fun with the same kind of setup in The Getaway 30 years ago. Now we're supposed to take it straight? Rockwell stole Hackman's wife from him & turned her against him with his sleazy charms??  If only he hadn't sent her to them in the first place, dot dot dot...  I mean jeezus, people, seriously.  But then she seemed way too young for him in the first place, an entirely middle-aged cast but for the femme fatale & Rockwell, it would've been fun if they'd been left with the gold after everyone else had coronaries.  (4) Hackman had been a professional thief for years, he had no money set aside?  He was dependent on a weasel like DeVito? even though he had access to a huge gold-smelting facility & other niceties?  (5) Ricky Jay was still strolling around with his young daughter after betraying the gangsters? He didn't think they'd come after him, & her?  (6) When Lindo popped up to save the day during the gunfight, he'd been hiding where, exactly?  Under the water?  And why have his character extol the virtue of prayer? Was that left over from his role as an angel in A Life Less Ordinary?  (7) The relationship between Hackman & the Mob guy whose name meant arrow was based on---what??  They spent time setting that up early on, then it just petered out.  An abandoned subplot?  Could've made for a nice payoff.....

The film is still interesting because of what writer/director David Mamet does with a cast made up exclusively of unsympathetic characters. Main character Joe Moore, played by Gene Hackman, an aging jewel thief is, of course, doing one last job before he gets out of town. There's no heroes here, only bad people trying to outsmart each other.Moore's has for years worked with the same crew, played by Delroy Lindo and Mamet regulars Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife) and Ricky Jay. Long-time Mamet associate Danny DeVito (director of the Mamet-penned Hoffa) plays Bergman, a crime boss whom Joe steals for and now intends to betray. Joe is a criminal who's developed a sense of who he can and cannot trust. The film's plot features the usual Mamet-ian double-cross after double-cross. Mamet has come up with better, though. Spanish Prisoner and House of Games flex your brain much more than this one does.Mamet's directorial efforts have come to look better and better over the years and Heist is his most ambitious yet. He borrows P.T. Anderson's cinematographer Robert Elswit to shoot this one, with nice results. Mamet is making progress as a film director, but still needs to untie his actors more. Seemingly as enamored with his own writing as other directors are, he instructs his players to utter the lines exactly as written. He either needs to stop writing such precise dialogue or allow the actors to meld the dialogue to their own acting styles a little more.Mamet's body of work speaks for itself, and other directors have created great films from his scripts. Going back to 1982 with The Verdict, helmed by Sidney Lumet, the list of directors who have filmed his scripts is staggering Brian DePalma (Untouchables), Neil Jordan (We're No Angels), Barry Levinson (Wag the Dog), and John Frankenheimer (Ronin). Perhaps the two best Mamet-scripted films have been by less famous directors, though, Glengarry Glen Ross by James Foley and The Edge by Lee Tamahori. All of these directors have breathed life into the script while freeing the actors enough to bring forth the strength of Mamet's words. It's not the same when Mamet directs his own work.

But although this movie had some good points, I could think of more bad points than good ones. It obviously meant well, and it sure seemed felt like it SHOULD be a good movie, I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth that has not gone away.The acting was not as impressive as it should have been. Gene Hackman was, of course, very good, but his performance was the only notable one. Danny DeVito was OK, but his role was nothing spectacular. I found this to be funny, because in the trailer, he looked like the best part of the movie. This as because his best parts were including in the trailer, and this is also true of the dialogue in this movie. Aside from the final words between Hackman and DeVito at the end of this movie, (which I think is the funniest and most cleverest in the entire film) all the truly good lines had been used in the commercials. A lot of the remaining dialogue was for the most part, not nearly as clever. More than one line just seemed flat out stupid to me. (For example, after punching and incapacitating someone, Delroy Lindo's character said Why did the chicken cross the road? Because the road crossed the chicken? What the hell does that mean?)Another thing that I found annoying was the unbelievable amount of double-crosses and twists in this movie, especially at the end. After the first twist (which is early in the movie), the rest are pretty easy to see coming. So the ending becomes predictable. (SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD!) The only twist I didn't see coming was when Hackman's wife left him at the end for the loser DeVito cronie at the end, and the only reason I didn't see this coming was that it was so ridiculously stupid, it doesn't seem conceivable.(SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD!) Another bad point that really stuck with me was that after one of the members of Hackman's gang was killed, nobody seemed to care. Even though they were all very close to each other throughout the rest of the film, and even though that the particular person killed was even willing to let himself get hit by a car (!) just to give other gang members a chance to get away from a very small threat, after he died, the others just seemed to shrug and forget about it.There were a few good points aside from Gene Hackman in this movie too, such as some good dialogue, an exciting ending gunfight scene and some cool robbery scenes. But it's still not enough for me to consider the movie recommendable. If you're a big Hackman fan, you might want to check it out just for him.

Gene Hackman is this master-thief who has three great aids. Their work is perfect and flawless. Until on one operation Gene Hackman is burned (his face exposed to security cameras) and has to retire simply because he didn't want to kill an innocent woman in a robbery. (Keep that in mind.)This is when the chess games between him and Danny Devito (the corrupt thief in charge of fencing the good and finding targets) begin to fall in place. Unfortunately, the game is not balanced. Gene Hackman is given too much brain power in his role whereas Devito is given the brain power of a hamster.Contradictions are not few in this movie. At one point, Delroy Lindo (Hackmans's assistant) is this brash idiot who doesn't realize a bag full of jewelry is empty, at another point he's as masterfully skilled and smart as his boss. Hackman refuses to kill the innocent woman yet shoots injured thieves in cold-blood like a professional assassin.Yet, as far as thrill goes, the movie is very good up until three quarters of it. You are honestly surprised by most of the moves that Hackman does in his game of chess with Devito. Then something goes wrong (my guess is they lost the script for the last quarter of the movie) and things start repeating themselves. All of a sudden.. The Ooohs and Aaahs in the movie theater are replaced by What? How did he fall for that? or I bet he's bluffing him again. And that's when you know a thriller has lost it.That's what happens in Heist.. How many times can Hackman lie to people about where the loot is and get away with it? It gets very boring near the end where you can see from a mile away.The most mysterious part of the whole movie is where Rebecca Pidgeon stands. You're never sure where her allegiance lies. Even as the very last scene of the movie unfolds. You're not sure exactly if she's with Hackman or not.Overall though.. There is no shortness of acting greatness in the movie.. Hackman is great, Devito was born to play out the evil dirty little guy, Lindo and Jay play their roles very well as the assistants to Hackman. Special props have to go to Sam Rockwell because he REALLY gets under your skin with the way he plays out the over-confident spoiled jerk whom Hackman has to take along on a very delicate robbery and who thinks at every turn that he can outsmart Hackman (and naturally doesn't). He plays the role very well and I believe, like Devito, Rockwell can make a living playing those irritating over-confident jerks, he was masterful in the Green Mile and he's pretty obnoxious here too.

The second robbery is equally well executed and filmed; however, from thence onwards the problems start.One problem is that there are too many red herrings which are never resolved; one might think the surveillance tape from the beginning will endanger the subsequent robbery, but it never resurfaces. A lot of loose strands in the plot are opened in several places without ever being resolved. What about the sale of the boat, for example? Add to that some serious plot improbabilities. How Jimmy tracked down Fran by merely writing down the license plate of a truck she stepped into seems rather strange.Fran is, by the way, the major plot hole in the movie. When and why she defected the gang and changed sides is never clear. Up to the end I was sure it was just another one of Moore's tricks to mislead Jimmy and Bergman -- turns out it wasn't, but the solution as it was was both unbelievable and rather weak.Similarly, the final shoot-out between Joe and Bergman's henchmen felt particularly out of place, as was the scene when Pincus was caught and shot -- both were such significant changes of mood and genre that the whole film felt terribly disrupted.One major problem was also that the ending was quite predictable -- it was obvious that Moore would get the gold in the end, so the question was not really if, but how he would be able to distract and mislead his opponents. No plot twist therefore seemed much of a surprise, even at the very end, when Jimmy and Fran reappear, I wasn't surprised much... except for Fran's betrayal, which, as I already pointed out, merely felt wrong.I'm not even mentioning the minor plot holes, which were there in abundance.As for acting, Gene Hackman and Danny DeVito were terrific, especially in the scenes where they are confronting each other. It's hard to ever imagine DeVito in comedy movies, given the intense portrayal of a criminal character in this movie. I have the usual problem with Rebecca Pidgeon I never know if she's not too much of an actress or if it's just Mamet's female characters which don't ring true; her character in this movie was definitely problematic in the latter respect.I give this 5 points for some decent acting from Hackman, DeVito and Delroy Lindo, plus two great robbery scenes. However, the script of the movie simply suffers from too many plot holes and problems to deserve a better rating. In Mamet terms, this is a major disappointment.

But he still has to deal with issues like creating parts for his wife, Rebecca Pidgeon, who must always be important element on the plot.

"},{"Title":"Heist and Spartan","Date":"10 August 2013","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" This is a review of Heist and Spartan, two unconventional thrillers by David Mamet. Both films mark the beginning of Mamet's crypto-fascist period, in which he slid from angry left-winger to right-wing caricature. Henceforth his scripts would become obsessed with the aesthetics of toned bodies, knife-fights, semi-naked wrestlers, and US special agents who excel at taking down Arabs and head-shotting bad guys (Spartan would later be worked by Mamet into The Unit, a TV series which follows a US Spec-Ops group).On the flip-side, working within the confines of genre (the heist movie in Heist, the action movie in Spartan) allows Mamet to perfect the kind of blunt functionalism he's been working toward throughout his career. And so both films feature extremely parred down dialogue, narratives which are barely told, professional characters who worship at the altar of efficiency, and minimalist dialogue which moves with a distinctly staccato, or almost perfunctory rhythm.Both films are also explicitly cinematic con jobs. Mamet, of course, has long been a director who approaches storytelling as an elaborate card trick, his films oft about magicians, hucksters or con artists. In this regard, both Heist and Spartan constantly defy audience expectations. Watch how Mamet very subtly subverts and plays with genre tropes, uses dialogue to mask and misdirect, how he approaches scenes from odd angles, every sequence always just a little bit off, and watch how he continues his trend of casting comedians in serious roles. This mirrors the philosophy of both films' heroes, who rely on doing the unexpected. Take one scene in Spartan, in which our hero repeatedly asks Why's the TV on?, the nonsensical, repeated phrase designed to misdirect and scrabble the mind of his opponents. Such tactics result in an interesting hybrid films which feel at once generic and off-kilter.Mamet is clearly more interested in professional mastery - a trait which his heroes share - than in the production of masterpieces. Indeed, after Homicide, Mamet would write a book in which he explains his new film-making philosophy. From this point onwards he would strip his films down drastically. The result simple lighting, direct dialogue, unfussed camera work and minimal music.Consider this line from Mamet's book Acting should be a series of simple physical actions. If the actor wants to know how he should walk to a door in the scene, the director should tell him, 'Go to the door,' and, if the actor presses on 'Go to the door. Quickly.' Don't act. Don't emote. No motivation. No back-story. No character arc. No discovery. These are indulgences that cannot possibly be manifested physically. Just go to the door. Quickly. Cut. Print. Go home. Mamet's new found philosophy &#x96; which he calls heightened logic - perhaps offers an understanding into why his films are so mannered, why his stories all revolve around elaborate cons and why he's drifting toward pulpy genres.If on the surface Mamet's films tend to be about con-jobs, covertly they're all about Mamet's true passion language. Language is often &#x96; if not inherently - selfish. To talk, especially in the way that Mamet's characters talk, is to con. Stunted half sentences and droning repetitions aren't there just for the fun of it. They are successful and less successful attempts at persuasion.In this way, you might say Mamet's films are all about words and syntax (his Oleanna stage-play would be about a kind of word rape). Post Homicide, however, his directing style evolved in such a way as to eradicate everything that detracts from his words. By removing music, cinematography, acting, sound etc, you've essentially cancelled out the director's vision. And after you've cancelled out a director's vision and an actor's interpretation, nothing remains but the writer's prose.Elsewhere, Mamet's later films tend to be preoccupied with a kind of Zen like professionalism, a trait which he himself shares as a writer (his scripts are attempts to perfect the word, to hone and purify one's personal skills). As such, his later films often feature an antagonistic bond between mentor and protégé, Mamet's younger characters always striving for the professionalism represented by the older mentor. We see this in both Heist and Spartan, both films revolving around wise old timers who have neither the time nor the inclination to school the less-seasoned buffoons around them. Spartan, incidentally, is a loose remake of Mamet's script for Ronin. Both films are named after ancient warriors, and feature highly skilled, lone wolf heroes. In Spartan we have Val Kilmer as a machine-like guy hell bent on finding a kidnapped girl (Where is the girl? he repeatedly says, his phrase uttered like dispassionate machine code), and in Ronin we have Robert DeNiro as an ex special forces agent determined to retrieve a mysterious case.Unfortunately, both Heist and Spartan end with unimaginative shoot outs. Such routine endings are somewhat common in Mamet's work.8.5/10 - Worth multiple viewings.

Danny DeVito has a much smaller role than expected, but he makes use of the little screen time he has with another perfect dramatic performance.

And `Heist,' the latest offering written and directed by Mamet is no exception.  This one involves a crew of criminals led by Joe Moore (Gene Hackman), doing a thing, yes a thing, don't you see, yes, don't you see, they have to do this thing for this other criminal named Bergman (Danny DeVito) before they'll get their cut of the last thing they did for him.  And so it goes for Joe and his crew, Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo), Pinky (Ricky Jay) and his wife, Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon), as well as Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell), Bergman's man, whom he insists must be included with Joe's crew for the latest `thing,' or robbery.  The heist of the title.  It's the reason they're all here, and it's the reason, yes, don't you see, it's the reason the audience is here, too.	Anyone familiar with Mamet will appreciate-- or at least understand-- the opening paragraph of this review; and by the same token, those same people will probably be somewhat disappointed with this film, because though it is pure Mamet, it is sub-par Mamet.  The problems begin with the casting, or more precisely, the miscasting of the project.  I never thought I'd feel that Gene Hackman didn't belong in a film, but in this case I do.  Not that he did a bad job here-- I don't think Hackman has ever done a `bad' job in anything-- but he didn't do a `Mamet' job.  And neither did Danny DeVito.  Both outstanding actors and craftsman, without question, but neither did justice to the material in this one, which certainly has nothing to do with their respective abilities and talents.  	Mamet has perfected a certain style which has everything to do with the way his actors deliver their lines, something of a Mamet trademark `clipped' delivery that Hackman and DeVito simply did not seem to grasp.  It's a way of presenting Mamet's material that in his previous films has been perfected by the likes of Joe Mantegna, William H. Macy, Campbell Scott and Lindsay Crouse.  Here, only Rebecca Pidgeon and Ricky Jay managed to deliver it effectively; otherwise it was missing.  And it made a tremendous difference to the overall success of this film.  On the surface, it may seem like a small thing, but without that particular style of speaking-- of presenting the dialogue-- the usual tension and suspense that Mamet manages to build and sustain throughout a film was sorely lacking.  Another factor may be that the plot of this one was not as intricate or involved as that of `House of Games' or `The Spanish Prisoner,' both of which kept you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  This story is a bit more straightforward, and as such was perhaps simply not conducive to that magic Mamet touch that accounted for the success of his previous films.  Not that this is a bad film-- it's not-- it's just that it could've been so much more, which is what fans of Mamet, especially, have come to expect.  	As previously stated, Hackman gives a solid performance here, but it's simply not the kind of presentation that was needed to bring this story to life.  And the same goes for DeVito; a good job, but just not right for this material.  Delroy Lindo seemed to fall into that same No Man's Land, as well.  Just as certain actors-- even great actors-- cannot do a Woody Allen film justice (Kenneth Branagh in `Celebrity,' for instance), not all actors are cut out to do Mamet.  Performance-wise, the only saving grace of this film is Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife in real life), whose presence alone is mesmerizing.  The bottom line is, she knows how to do `Mamet;' she knows, yes, she certainly knows, don't you see, how to put his material across.  And watching her do it is a study in perfection.  As she demonstrated in `The Spanish Prisoner' and again in `State and Main,' she can single-handedly take a Mamet project to a higher notch on the scale.  Unfortunately, as good as she is here, it's not enough to raise the bar to a more satisfying level.  Her performance alone, however, makes this film worth seeing.	The supporting cast includes Patti LuPone (as Betty Croft-- a thankless role for an actor of her stature, and one that leads you to believe that most of her work here must have ended up on the cutting room floor), Karen Cliche (Alex), Christopher Kaldor (Laszlo), Andreas Apergis (Trooper) and Tony Calabretta (Coffeeman).  Not every film can be a gem, especially when the director has guts enough to take a chance and go outside the box in an attempt to keep his material fresh and new, which is exactly what Mamet tried with `Heist,' beginning with his cast.  And you can't fault Mamet; there's not a director around who wouldn't take a chance on Hackman for any project, and with good reason.  And, again, this IS a decent film-- it's just not that `classic' Mamet, and looking at it from another perspective, if every director's `misfire' was as good as this, there wouldn't be any `bad' films at all.  In the final analysis, Mamet fans are going to want to see this one, and everyone else should give it a look, as well, because it is entertaining, and for most will undoubtedly be a satisfying cinematic experience.  Because, in the end, it's still all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.

House of Games had some things going for it. But it also had stinky language (Aren't you a caution?). I could endure it's artifice based on the very deliberate pacing, like a game; up until that unsatisfying ending where he threw structure and pacing out the window for a slip-up/revelation straight out of Freud 101.Mamet's current, non-descript wife Rebecca Pigeon shows up in an undeserved central role, as he likes to do (the previous Mrs. Mamet, Lyndsey Crouse was not bad in House of Games). Pigeon has more than worn out her chirpy, shallow welcome.On the other side, Mamet could help you realize what an antiquated, exhausted genre the heist film is.

Jimmy Silk from the outset stands behind the protagonists, upstaging them at every turn both in the film and in terms of stagecraft. Silk slinks, mopes, undercuts and manipulates at every turn. His first casualty is the long established orderly arrangement twixt Joe Moore and Mickey Bergman. The latter arranged the jobs that Joe and his crew adroitly executed - until in slunk Silk and all went awry.Moore and Bergman descend into irreconcilable differences. Silk marks Fran Moore, mocks Bobby Blane, and grossly disrespects Joe at every turn.

Why have the little woman worrying at home when she can come with you tooled up ready for trouble? Couples that steal together, stay together?

This is a plod-plod-plod people at work movie and we have to witness their methods and reasoning in detail rather like watching a plumber fix your kitchen sink from behind their shoulder.What is wrong with Danny Devito (here the big boss!)? Well for a start he is too obvious. He wouldn't make a good criminal because he stands out (or is it under?) from the crowd. A professional arguer, the type that pretends to get angry over the phone but is really having the time of his life with it. You have to admire the guys spunk, but the tricks are limited. I am sure he is sweet guy in real life, but I wouldn't want to take any chances with him. I am sure he would make a terrible enemy.Another thing, Rebecca Pidgeon (Gene's on-the-job-too wife) has short hair and smokes a lot. Remember the Sharon Stone rule Short hair and chain smoking means trouble in movies, besides has she looked at her husband's birth certificate recently?

Movies today feature men of all ages getting down with women of 24.(So quick tip for all budding actresses, get to like being with older men!)Do we really have to mention the plot? Surely not. People want to steal money, people don't want money stolen. Yes, it sounds silly in cold print, but that doesn't mean that isn't what is going on here. As Hitchcock once famously said the audience (that is all of us) are immoral. Show us a burglar at work and we want to see them get away with it, we want to warn them that people are coming home. Maybe that explains why some people don't call the police when they see someone breaking in to someone else's house in real life?This is routine stuff, but no one does routine stuff like Hackman, well apart from Sean Connery maybe. He is old, bald, podgy, immoral, careless with his wife (in this film at least), but he has it. Don't ask me what it is only that he has it. You can watch him brush his teeth and be entertained. I guess that why some actors are stars and other actors are not. And probably why directors pray that they will say yes when they only have mediocre self-written scripts to work with.

Some might been expected, but others were a surprise.  But I can't say the story is perfect, since there are a few unlikely scenarios, which includes, the relabeling of the carts containing the gold from the Suisse bank to their own is a little far fetched, assuming that the cops would let you wheel off these identical carts off an airplane that just got robbed.  It would have been easier if they shifted the gold to another container that looked completely different.  The ending where the Rebecca Pidgeon character takes the painted bars without checking if they are really gold seemed unlikely, given how much these crooks knows how they always double cross each other.It doesn't come to the level of The Spanish Prisoner or House of Games, where the surprise comes out of the left field.  In this movie, it was basically crooks double crossing crooks, so when one of them shows up unannounced, you could expect some handover of the gold, which would turn out to not be the real thing.I presume many of the negative reviews comes from people who watched the movie because of the actors, not knowing what a Mamet film is like.Overall, still an enjoyable Mamet movie.

'Bad pacing, convoluted plot, anachronistic dialogue'. Congratulations, you just described Pulp Fiction or any other noncomformist movie made in the last 20 years.The Heist is a joy to watch, and although it's completely unrealistic (what good caper movie IS realistic?), it succeeds at what it strives to be - a caper movie so full of twists it makes your head spin. The acting is flawless, and the dialogue? People complain about the characters 'not using modern vernacular'. Why on earth should they? Ever think that aside from generally accepted slang, small circles of people tend to use their own, incomprehensible-to-others phrases? The point isn't to make sure the audience knows the exact meaning and etymology of every utterance, the point is style, and having lines the suit the characters. And they do that perfectly.The direction is wonderful, the shootout on the boat is coherent, yet realistic. The heists themselves are executed wonderfully, and never did I check my watch during the time in between them. Most importantly, this movie doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. It's fun, it's stylish because of the acting, pacing, and dialogue, and not because of the visual cinematic masturbation of Ocean's 11 or any John Woo film; it's a caper movie that's 95% caper and no filler. Accusing it of too many twists is like accusing Reservoir Dogs of too many men in identical suits.If you still think you're right about this movie's merits, I'd recommend taking a glance at David Mamet's resume. Considering his impressive track record, isn't it quite possible that this isn't the case of a movie being bad, but simply a case of YOU not getting it? Ebert and Berardinelli, the best critics I know, and almost always agree with, gave this movie 3.5 stars out of 4. I do the same.

For those of you unfamiliar with his work, David Mamet typically uses short, jerky, idiomatic sentences which bounce back and forth between characters, in order to simulate the way that people usually talk -- rent Glengary Glenross or Wag The Dog if you want examples of his writing style. While it might not always be true to life, it can be very entertaining, and I have to say that I enjoy it.This style is SO overly done in Heist however, that it sounds like the studio brought in a ghost-writer to imitate (badly) the way that Mamet usually writes. It is so idiomatic that it reads like its in code. The characters don't talk to one another, they recite street-wise aphorisms, all of which are rich with double meaning. And, yes, I get it. That was the point, this is a movie about plans and counterplans, wheels with wheels, nothing is entirely as it seems. But come on! It would have been a relief to just hear one of the characters relax for half a minute, and tell one of the others what he really felt, and not just cleverly allude to it.There is remarkably little violence in the movie, except at the end, where there is a big gun battle. I found myself beaking up laughing during the gun battle -- it was because there was so much clever subtext in the movie, I actually felt a degree of physical relief at seeing the characters do something forthright and direct. This being said, though, its not a bad movie, though some people might find it hard to follow. Gene Hackman and Danny Devito give great performances, and the dialogue is entertaining.

David Mamet's `Heist' was one of the best films of 2001.  Compare this to Frank Oz's limp DeNiro/Brando vehicle `Score,' a much more financially successful film.  The plots are virtually the same--aging thief pushed into `one last job' by a fat jerk who forces him to take along a young partner. That was a pretty shopworn plot even 20 years ago.  But whereas Oz seemed unaware of this fact, it is obvious that Mamet is knowingly using the familiar framework, the cliches, to play off of.  Mamet's film is better plotted, has better performances and characterizations, of course better dialogue, and (surprise) it is more interesting visually. Was anyone really surprised (or involved) by `Score's much hyped `twist ending'? Anyone who's ever seen a crime movie--even one--had that figured out even before the projector began running. It was a lazy film.  `Heist', on the other hand, is the polar opposite of a lazy film--it is a workout. You cannot watch the movie lazily, you cannot go out for popcorn, you have to actually pay attention. This is most likely why `Score' was a fair sized hit, and `Heist' will only gather steam on video.  `Score' is like watching the rain fall through your kitchen window. Watching `Heist' is more like a puzzle with parts so beautiful and interesting you can't put it down. But even without its lazy doppelganger out there crowding the market of mediocrity, `Heist' would obviously stand out as a masterpiece.How can people hate a crime movie with this exchange of dialogue in it`Don't you wanna hear my last words?'`I just did.'BANG.`Heist' is Mamet's best film to date, and right up there with the best of 2001.

In my opinion the Score is the better of the two. The Heist is a bad movie compared to The Score and the Usual Suspects for many reasons. The first reason is because it had little character development. There is little character development because of the writer's zeal to add every plot twist he could think of, leaving little room for the characters to become likable, grow, and develop. I kid you not there is a plot twist in every freaking scene. This brings up the second fault, which is that the story is just too clever for it's own good. The story has numerous twist and turns that go nowhere. the third problem is that there are too many characters to keep track of. In my opinion one of the things that sets apart The Score and the Usual Suspects from this piece of crap is that these two movies keep their main characters to a minimum. A fourth fault is that I did not like any of the characters, for some reason David Mamet did not give us any reason to like any of these characters. I am quessing because he was to busy writing all those twist and turns. I did like two of the characters and that was Gene Hackman's character and Delroy Lindo's. One final thought/fault is the story, to me it seems contrived and pretentious along with it's director and writer. This movie is so contrived and pretentious it makes sheep want to count the minutes to the end. There are some good things about this movie. The first positive thought about this movie are the action scenes and the planning of the heist are shot and written well. A second reason is the characters of Hackman's and Lindo's. A third positive thing is the acting and that they did a good with what they had to work with, a script that went nowhere. This film did not totally suck, it just had too much and too little. Here is a brief summary of said movie. The Heist starts with Hackman's character and crew rob a jewelry store for Danny DeVito's character, but Hackman's character is caught on candid camera. DeVito's character uses this blackmail to get Hackman to do another job before retiring, DeVito also has his nephew (played by Sam Rockwell; Charlie's Angels) go along to make sure Hackman does the job right without any double crossing. In between the planning, the actually heist, and the aftermath of the heist there is a lot of double crossing and back stabbing. I think this movie is just average, so it give it a C grade and just ** out of **** stars. Thank you for your time and attention!

The story then introduces us to thief Gene Hackman, his sexy wife Rebecca Pidgeon, their partners and their adversaries fellow thief Danny Devito and his crew.  The remainder of the show consists mostly of the opposing teams crossing and double crossing each other as they vie for an airline shipment of gold.The dialogue, as expected from Mamet, is snappy and rhythmic, poetic and beautiful.  The cast is good to a person.  The always admirable Hackman adds a special seasoning to any project and this is no exception.  Devito is equally entertaining and even Ms. Pidgeon has a quietly mystical air that held my attention nicely.  The lightning pace and engrossing plot are more than enough to carry the movie.But like the jewel theft in the opening scene, This is not a heist without flaws.  At his core, Mamet will always be a playwright more than a filmmaker.  His characters have an almost surreal quality that tends to distract from the story they are expected to blend into.  His dialogue, brilliant though it is, is a little too offbeat, too perfect for a medium that requires believability, that has its roots in realism.  Theatrical dialogue is enhanced by a distinct, musical quality.  Film thrives on the lack of it.And some of the surprises are not all that clever.  I anticipated them, hoping I was wrong and disappointed when I wasn't.  Where The Spanish Prisoner kept me guessing, Heist made me wish I hadn't.  I have credibility questions as well.  To sneak into not one, but two secure environments, I certainly hope it requires more than donning a uniform and saying the regular guy couldn't make it.Heist is fast moving fun and satisfying storytelling.  If neither Hackman's nor Mamet's plan works perfectly, both old pros take a commendable shot at it.

Joe, who is an aging thief, has to make one last score for his fence Bergman, played well by Danny DeVito, in order to finally retire.

It reminds you of a Hitchcock movie in some respects. Kudos to Rebecca Pidgeon, who does an excellent job of playing an ice cold evil woman with an agenda of her own. My only criticism for this movie is the fact that Mamet has gone back to his old ways by having massive amounts of vulgar profanity that detract fromt the otherwise great script and the fact he is recycling lines from Glen Garry Glenross like Break my rice bowl. Mamet claims he wanted to make this movie like the films of the forties and fifties. With all the profanity he failed in that respect.

Joe and Bergman are both different, Joe wouldn't kill anybody during the robbery, where Bergman would.  Joe figured that since he got burnt or spotted on a video camera without wearing a mask, he needs to get out of the theift business.  Bergman wants Joe to do one more job, this time Joe and his team have Bergman's arogant nephew Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell) to help them with the next heist, robbing a jetliner filled with Swiss gold bars.     HEIST is one of those films where you are excited to see how the heist job could be done.  Once it's done, you would slap yourself on the forehead and say, duh! Why didn't I think of that?  It could work!  Plus to add more flavor to the feature, Mamet has developed well thought-out characters for his film.  Joe wants out of the business and to just build sail boats, Bobby is cautious, Fran is crafty, Pinky is willing to fall down or get hurt as long as it helps accomplish the job, and Bergman is a man who shoots first and doesn't bother to ask questions because he knows he's right.  That is very well done character development, which is rare for most crime/caper movies these days.  And when the heist is done, you wonder, how are the people going to get away with this?     A good aspect with HEIST is the acting by the actors, everyone does a great job.  Hackman is great as usual, as the leader of the group, a man who shows that he's done this so many times and that this is work as usual.  Lindo is good as the no-nonsense man who doesn't trust anybody he doesn't know too well.  Rockwell is also good as the egotistical young thug who think he knows everything about crime since his uncle is a mob boss.  Pidgeon proves that she can be both sexy and dangerous as the seductive wife of Joe who will do anything that a woman would do to get information.  Jay is enjoyable and at times funny as the fall-down man who will cause a distraction as the thieves leave with the stolen loot.  And DeVito does a very nice turn as a villian, something I haven't seen him do in a while.      I call HEIST a very good little film.  It's little because there isn't a cast of hundreds or tons of extras in the film, maybe a cast of thirty or so.  There isn't any car chases or major explosions (just one in fact).  It's a film that states that in order to have a good crime film, you need wit, not action to make it work.  And work, it does. ****1/2 (out of five) "}{"Title":"Don't you want to hear my last words?

Naturally, I left work early so I could get in line. Now, I arrived at three in the afternoon for a seven o'clock showing, and the line was already extremely long. But I got as far as being the first person left after *almost* every seat had been filled, and I actually would have gotten in if David Mamet hadn't breezed up at a minute before seven. So, as you would expect, I held a grudge against him for quite some time.But when I saw Heist for the first time, at a preview screening at the then-brand-new Fenway Theater, I decided right there and then to forgive Mr. Mamet for denying me place at the preview screening of Pulp Fiction. Because Heist is one of those films I manage to watch over and over without ever getting tired of it. This may have a lot to do with the overloaded dialogue, which probably wouldn't have worked with a less seasoned cast, but it clicks for me here on every cylinder. I often quote the opening bit of conversation between Gene Hackman and Delroy Lindo, about love and gold--priceless.So thanks, David Mamet. All is forgiven.

Unfortunately, he never impresses as a great director (I have now seen three of his directorial works). I think he is one of the two best screenplaywrights in the US--the other being Sam Shepard.In contrast to the lackluster direction however, the film's script is incredibly entertaining in both wit and structure. The end of the film leaves the audience wondering if the smirk on the face of the main character tells you there's more to the end of the story than the film reveals. Has he lost his young woman or has he tied up his shoes to quote an earlier dialogue with another heist of some kind? It is interesting to note that the film is not called The Heist but Heist--therein lies a tale told by a playwright who knows the importance of the definite article in English language.Gene Hackman, Ricky Jay, and Rebecca Pidgeon raise the film's strength by providing top-notch performances--Pidgeon's performance could easily be mistaken for a poor one. Look closely at her character and you see her interpretation of the gangster's moll is modeled on Lauren Bacall's characters in Bogart films, only with a 21st century flavor. I see this film as her finest work yet--I only wish she works with a better director than husband Mamet. She has style and screen allure that matches Bacall when she was at her prime. As a scriptwriter, Mamet gets better and better with each film. In The Untouchables, director Brian De Palma held the reins and Mamet's contribution was overshadowed. So was the case of his work in Danny De Vito's Hoffa. Its only in Mamet-directed films that his brilliant scripts stand out (e.g., The Spanish Prisoner, The Winslow Boy). Probably this is why he directs his own films. He probably knows the director will downplay his script/screenplay.

His films adapted from his stage plays are all much better than his original screenplays, but Heist is a good effort. The film is about long time criminal Joe Moore, played by Gene Hackman. Joe begrudgingly takes on one last heist to steal a shipment of gold. However, Joe's employer sends along his nephew to ensure that the the haul from the heist is split evenly. Things play out like a fairly typical crime thriller, but the film is plenty entertaining and bares enough merit to warrant approval.Heist has plenty of good things going for it. To begin, it has a great cast full of a diverse amount of people with wide ranges of skill. Gene Hackman is great in his leading role and he fits the role excellently. He is an actor that can carry a film very well, and in Heist he does just that. Opposite Hackman is Danny DeVito as the sinister Mickey Bergman, Hackman's sleazy employer. He becomes your typical archetypal villain by the end of the film, but DeVito plays him great nonetheless. The rest of the supporting cast includes talents such as Rebecca Pidgeon, Delroy Lindo, and Ricky Jay as the other three members of Hackman's crew. They're each very different and played to a fun extent by their respective actors. Sam Rockwell, a current favorite of mine, is DeVito's nephew. He's a loser and an idiot, but makes for a fun character that plays into the story very well. That being said, the storyline in Heist isn't actually anything spectacular. It's fun and intriguing, but when you break it down it isn't terribly unique. But hey, at least the film has a story right? Heist has a very stylistic feel to it that I would have liked to see go further than it did. It does a lot of cool stuff that does keep it interesting throughout. For one, the score is great. Theodore Shapiro composed the original score for the film and it adds a lot to the style. It heightens some of the best moments of the film and also gives it a somewhat 80's thriller feel which I found entertaining at least. Probably one of the most interesting and well written aspects of the film would be the way this group of criminals pull off all of their heists. It is all through acting and improv skills. It constitutes dressing up as different professions and setting up false scenarios in order to set up situations. The heist itself could have gone a lot further but it is still fun. It lacks the depth that Mamet's other thrillers, but doesn't disappoint overall. I compared it to Mamet's directorial debut, House of Games (1987) and the depth of that film and the levels of the con/heist that developed in that movie. Heist had the potential to reach this level but unfortunately didn't quite make it.It shocks me to say that the main area where Heist falls short would be its story and script. The story is what it is and I found plenty of enjoyment for what it was worth, but there were some very noticeable issues with the screenplay. For the most part it is good. However, it is not consistent. There are moments in the film that definitely feel like Mamet. There are some very witty and insightful profundities that spring up from time to time in this film that brought a smile to my face. But there are other moments when characters utter things so silly, unnecessary, and absurd that you have to wonder what Mamet was thinking when he wrote it. Like I said before, Mamet's true talent lies in his playwriting ability rather than his screen writing ability. Some lines that may have looked good on paper just didn't translate well to the movie. Thankfully none of the nonsense that appears in this script is terribly blatant or it would have been a much bigger issue.Heist is far from perfect but it is undoubtedly fun. It is a fun film, especially if you are into big crime flicks. There isn't a whole lot to Heist and overall it isn't that memorable. But I had a good time while watching it, so I can give it credit for entertaining me for those two hours. It is not Mamet's best effort as far as the script goes, especially because I know how much better he can do (ie. Glengarry Glen Ross, House of Games, etc.) But looking at Heist as just another film, I was at least satisfied by the end and didn't regret watching the film one bit.

Gene Hackman gives another stellar performance as a tired thief, who just wants out. Ricky Jay (a Mamet regular) and Delroy Lindo compose his rock solid crew. Rebecca Pidgeon (Mrs. Mamet and also a Mamet regular) is Hackman's over the head relationship catch. She's witty, smart, beautiful, and about twenty some odd years his junior. Sam Rockwell and Danny Devito are the criminals who sometimes pay the bills, and sometimes just rip off those who rip off for a living. There's definitely no honor among thieves in this lot.

For the better part of a hundred minutes I stayed hinged on the end of my seat, scrutinizing every reel, just waiting for David Mamet to screw something up and justify the tirade that would then ensue from my eager typing fingers. Yet try as I might, I could find no flaw in his work, no typical Mametian pretension.That's not to say that `Heist' is perfect.  It requires the viewer to believe in a world where no one ever loses their cool (or gets caught), criminals can actually keep track of the extensive backlogs of all their double crosses, and people spit witty one-liners at each other in a manner only duplicated at Mamet's own breakfast table.  Granted, no one in the real world is like this.  No heist could ever work out as cleanly as the many showcased by this film.  But damned if Mamet'll let you remember that for a moment.  Go ahead, laugh it up you smug b*****d.  Laugh it up, all the way to the bank.Allow me to explain my disgust.  Mamet is a great writer-I'll grant him that.  Glengarry Glen Ross was a fine enough play, and he made a decent film of it.  And `Wag the Dog,' which thankfully kept Mamet's grubby fingers at the typewriter and off the director's chair, was a brilliant political satire that boasted fine performances from Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro.But that's where I draw the line with Mr. Mamet.  Sadly, for all his talent, the man, until recently, couldn't direct himself out of a wet paper bag with a hole in it.  `Oleanna' featured the first performance of William H. Macy's career that I could not stand to watch.  `The Spanish Prisoner' was about as cloying as it thought it was clever.  `The Winslow Boy'?  More like `Winslow Boring.'  And `State and Main,' while no doubt humorous to Mamet and his entourage of neo-realists-and with an admittedly great performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman-would have been more aptly titled `What a Piece of Crap.'And don't even get me started on Rebecca Pidgeon.  Over the course of several films, Mamet has had no qualms in filming his own wife in various stages of undress and bad acting in the throws of other actors, crew members, caterers, and errand boys.  I knew from the moment I saw the `Heist' trailer a few months ago that it was a Mamet film because it had that damned Rebecca Pidgeon in it and no one else in their right mind would put her in a film of theirs.Wow it feels good to get that off my chest.  You know, I bet David Mamet's the kind of guy who gets off to reading positive reviews of his films on the internet, which there are inexplicably many of.  I bet he saw my 8 out of 10 rating and started reading away, hoping for some desperate affirmation of his literary and cinematic worth.  Well, are you happy now?  Was it everything you hoped for?  Who's laughing now David Mamet?  Huh?  Who's laughing now?  Who's on top and who's on bottom now?  I said, who's on top and who's on bottom now??!!!I'm sorry, what was I talking about?  Oh yeah, `Heist.'  I can't believe I watched the whole thing.  Pidgeon was even passable.  Dammit I wanted to hate this movie so much, but alas it was not meant to be.  I suppose I'm far past the point of making a real review out of this by now.  But then it's probably better that way.  As with any good film, half the pleasure lies in watching it unfold without some halfwit critic having ruined all the plot twists and good lines for you. Hey, if you want a plot summary, go to the damned theater and see the movie for yourself, then ask the person next to you what the hell just happened. I know that helped me out a lot.  My plot recounter/ride for the night, Tacy (a shout out), was quite resourceful in explaining to me at one point in the film that a small child had not in fact been shot point blank in the head. And she called the film `damn near better than K-PAX,' the second highest possible rating on her K-PAX scale (the highest being `equal in all respects to K-PAX')  So there's your two thumbs up.  Go see the movie already.You may have won this round David Mamet.  But I'll be watching you, even more closely now, you glorious b*****d.

Heist belongs right up there with the aforementioned films because of its tricky twists and turns and its standout performances by the key players involved. Gene Hackman and wife Rebecca Pidgeon are high-class crooks who love nothing more than stealing with partners-in-crime Delroy Lindo and Ricky Jay. After one last score, or so we think, it is time for Hackman and his group to retire, but crime boss Danny DeVito wants one more score and he does not take no for an answer. He sends his nephew (Sam Rockwell) to make sure that there will be no double-crossing of any kind. Naturally there is nothing but double- and triple-crossing as it is made quite clear by writer/director David Mamet that there is no honor among thieves and it is every person for themselves. Mamet's film works because of intelligence and smart performances more than anything else. It is one of those films that may require multiple viewings and that is a sign of a winner in my book. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

It rules, it's a lot of fun and I loved it. I love the way they plan out everything exactly how it's going to happen. It seems like most movies the characters go in and do stuff and make it up as they go along. The dialog is cheesy, but it works and it seems like it's stuff that these people would say. I love how they get the gold, then get it again. Explain to me how movies like this cool get a 6.7 rating while predictible garbage like The Sixth Sense is #54 on the top 250? Heist is probably my number 2 film of 2001, right behind LOTR. Great movie.

Right after the spanish prisoner and Glengarry Glenn Ross (i know, he didn't direct the latter).I saw some reviewers compared it to the Score, but I think it's a clever and not as pretentious and pompous version of Ocean's 11. Take out 8 unnecessary and dull characters; add a sophisticated, yet logical plot and great acting. Yes, the dialogues are on the verge of bizarre and the characters may be flat, but overall I loved every minute of it.Last, but definitely not least, the excellent musical score- groovy, exciting, original.Overall, a great piece of work!

Mostly, I go to films to see stuff blow up. So you would think I'd love Heist. But I found it disappointing.Not a whole lot blows up in Heist. It's a straightforward crime flick without the intellectual themes and clever plot twists and dialogue we expect from David Mamet. Gene Hackman is wasted, and the entire cast plays it so cool that they pop right out of the film... magnified coolness is sort of like not being affected by whatever's around you, and is sort of the opposite of emoting, which we otherwise call *acting*. I'm starting to learn that the cooler than cool shtick that worked for Rebecca Pigeon in The Spanish Prisoner is just her way of not be able to actually act, and fails as miserably in Heist as it did in State and Main, where she actually cooled her way through a love scene.Sorry. Nepotism gets to me. (Pidgeon is married to David Mamet, the director/writer, and gets to be in all his films.) Now, where was I. Oh yeah.Crime flicks are supposed to be clever, but these criminals sort of beat the system straightforwardly with not enough tension and way too much smugness. I can't recommend this film for arty types either -- I didn't see much of choreography or script writing brilliance here -- but of course I wouldn't being the action buff. I like Arnold Schwartenegger.Who should see this film-- Action movie buffs on a rainy day with nothing better to do,and who didn't see State and Main. Or if you liked The Score-- I can't think of anyone else. Gene Hackman fans, skip it.Mamet fans, skip it. Go see Glengarry Glen Ross again.I give Heist a 5 out of 10.

Then I tried to think, 'What would he do?'","Date":"14 October 2011","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" The film is literally about a group of people who know exactly how to communicate and collaborate without even having to confer by speaking, confronted with a newcomer who doesn't speak that language at all, and probably couldn't to save his life, but they're nevertheless forced to deal with him. Mamet's twists aren't just twists. They work at this fundamental level, for instance as they all work right under our noses to rid themselves early in the game of this unexpected liability, how every character knows what the other really means and implicitly goes along with it lock, stock and barrel. This greenhorn, in all seriousness, expresses his guileless lack of understanding of what would ordinarily be expected to be meant, let alone the real situation as regards to him. Later on, when chance comes back to bite them, leader of the pack takes a moment to think, then gives them tasks. His number two guy asks where he's going with this, to which he just replies, Just listen. They often nod to each other from a distance and no one else sees. We've seen this done a lot, but not in this way too often What is the idea that one is communicating that the other immediately acts upon? Hackman plays Joe Cute as a Chinese Baby Moore, a thief whose real passion is building boats. His crew comprises Bobby (You know why the chicken crossed the road? 'Cause the road crossed the chicken.) and Pincus (He's so cool, when he goes to bed, sheep count him.), and Joe's wife Fran, who could talk her way out of a sunburn. They pull a big job, with one snag Joe's face on security camera. Time to tow anchor and aim for ports, but not as per Mickey Bergman, who forces Joe into One Last Job, and insists he include his incompetent nephew Jimmy Silk, the sort of madcap who packs a gun in an unsafe neighborhood which wouldn't be that if he left.The plot progresses through tangled altitudes of deception. Mamet adores magic, namely trickery, and this plot, like The Spanish Prisoner and House of Games, is a spectrum that refracts various realities conditional on how you're slanted at a given time. It also includes ample loads of criminal art, as in the minutiae of the opening diamond heist, and the way they appropriate gold ingots from a cargo plane later on.Some critics disliked the particulars I loved most. We learn from professional opinion-pushers that some climactic gunplay could've profited from more stylized treatment, which is amazingly unwise. Are they suggesting they would've favored one of those according-to-Hoyle automated gunfights we're tired of after innumerable overhauls? What I love about this climactic gunfight is the way some of the characters are clumsy and uncomfortable. This is perhaps their first gunfight. DeVito skips into the line of fire frantically, Let's just talk! Earlier, you suddenly find a violent confrontation breaking out between Delroy Lindo and a few of DeVito's heavies, and then going right back to trying to talk things out, right out of the building. The care with which Hackman says, He ain't gonna shoot me? Then he hadn't oughta point a gun at me. It's insincere. And the typical exactness of this exchange Hey, I'll be as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton. I don't want you as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton. I want you as quiet as an ant not even thinking about pissing on cotton. I'm also confused by why critics harass Rebecca Pidgeon. Yes, she has a distinguishing delivery which is well-matched with Mametized dialogue terse, abrupt, informal. Mamet enjoys creating anachronisms for her like when Joe says, Nobody lives forever, and with pure deadpan she replies, Frank Sinatra gave it a shot. She's not meant as a graceful classic noir succubus, though her character doesn't mind seizing that opportunity, but as a gutsy Anybodys sort who can't entirely be trusted. Mamet bothers to provide us with technique and inventiveness, and is criticized by professionals because his work doesn't come from an automated press.Hackman is naturally a connoisseur at gristly, graying veterans and, oddly, has been throughout his career. He and Lindo make a home in their roles so effortlessly facing twists and double-crosses with down-to-earth authenticity. A makeshift rapport that assures us they've collaborated for quite a long time and are like-minded on all that counts, their knowing abbreviation is like an old stand-up's slang, guiding our interest away from the ruse. And DeVito is one of the most unfailingly amusing actors in American cinema, with an oomph that makes his dialogue throb. I've just financialized the numbers, he rationalizes. He's not a bad guy here, simply an unethical capitalist glutton with risky affiliations.And one may wonder why Pidgeon's Fran would do what she does after the truck collision, but it's because we can't be certain whether her final surprise is really her final surprise. And the film closes with one of the great movie smiles, maybe a little more at us than what's transpired. And we smile back, cheek to cheek, because it's still self-contained This character knows the final surprise is not the final surprise. Heist is the brand of caper film that came before special effects supplanted sharpness, structure and dialogue. This movie is comprised of natural ingredients, not manufactured goods. With both heists, at the beginning and in the middle, major stakes are raised, because in spite of its practically record-setting amount of plot twists, it's about its characters. "}]
