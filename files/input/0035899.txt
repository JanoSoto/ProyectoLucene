Marked not only with the pentagram, but marked to never have a sequel that was all his own. A real shame, considering that even the likes of the Mummy got 'four' sequels. Universal begins their monster-mash rallies of the 1940s here, as Wolfie must share his sandbox with the undying monster & the two get along well for the most part, but eventually, even the best of friends will have their disputes....The film begins on a very high note, with one of the most chilling and atmospheric openings in any horror movie. The potential was certainly here for a great 'Wolf Man' sequel that could've surpassed the original. Too bad the monster has to rear his ugly, stitched up head. Speaking of that monster, Poor Bela always get the blame dumped on him for why this film had to be chopped up in post-production, the story always being that the monster with his voice was simply too Hungarian funny, yet this film was produced by the same Universal that a year earlier made Ghost of Frankenstein which featured the monster with Bela's voice. It didn't bother anyone then, so what was the problem now? There has to be more to the story than it was all Lugosi's fault. Would it be considered out of the realm of possibility to speculate that perhaps the great Curt Siodmak (the screenwriter) wrote some seriously crappy dialogue for the creature to recite that would've produced titters no matter who spoke it?Also marring the proceedings a bit is some shaky continuity in regards to the monster's portion of the story if you're familiar with the previous 'Ghost' movie. How is it, that there's suddenly a Frankenstein castle in Vasaria (or is it ViÂ·Saria), when in the previous film, the villagers in the town called Frankenstein blew it up. And there are many instances where the screenwriter doesn't seem to know the difference between Ludwig Frankenstein & his father Henry who made the monster, as Talbot, the villagers, even Baroness Frankenstein speak as if Ludwig actually created the monster.And yet, in spite of its inconsistencies (not to mention the heavy editing done to it), the whole of 'FMTWM' still turns out very good, and the ending clash of the monsters is very entertaining. While Frankenstein fans may be disappointed, this picture definitely works as a great 'Wolf Man' sequel & one of the top Universal romps from the 1940s. After this picture, Dracula and a few other fiends would get invited to the monster party.8/10 "},{"Title":"Universal Fun!","Date":"15 May 2001","Score":"22 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Though not nearly up to the standards and fun level of Ghost Of Frankenstein, this neat little Universal gem has it's heart in the right place!

Chaney is superb as the tormented Larry Talbot but Bela leaves quite a bit to be desired as the monster.

It is definitely not in the same league as the the early James Whale and Todd Browning classics (e.g., Frankenstein, The Bride of Frankenstein, Dracula, The Invisible Man, etc.). Nor is it quite as strong as The Son of Frankenstein. But it easily rivals The Ghost of Frankenstein and far surpasses the two House Of films (House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula). Lon Chaney Jr. is even better in this film than he is in the original Wolf Man (1941). And Lugosi is an impressive Frankenstein's monster, despite the studio's decision to cut references from the film to his blindness (a condition suffered by the monster in The Ghost of Frankenstein) and his dialogue (again, from acquiring the brain of Ygor in Ghost). The film is beautifully photographed, well acted and a unique departure from previous Universal monster fests in the way it teams up two legendary creatures. It's a splendid later entry in the Universal horror cycle. After this, the universal horror films left much to be desired, at least until the magnificent Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). I still put Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man in the DVD player if I'm feeling like watching what in my opinion is the studio's finest wartime horror film.

After achieving big-screen stardom in 1931's Dracula, he turned down the role of the Monster in Frankenstein, calling the inaudible creature a part for an idiot or a tall extra (according to William Gregory Manks' fine book on the Frankenstein series, It's Alive).  As a result, a bit player named Boris Karloff accepted the part and became the cinema's number one boogieman, far eclipsing the proud Hungarian actor who would soon be reduced to supporting roles, often second-billed to the lisping Englishman he is often said to have envied and despised.  For Lugosi, Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman may have been more traumatic and embarrassing than the Ed Wood films he would soon be reduced to appearing in, because here the rarely employed actor was cast in the very role he so proudly declined, the role that helped put his more successful rival on the map. As the Monster, Lugosi is pretty terrible but his ineffective performance was made worse in the editing room where his dialogue was cut out after it was decided that the Monster should not have an Hungarian accent.  Yet Lugosi's lips move and he flails his arms about as if he were speaking.  It's a rather sad footnote to what is an enjoyable horror yarn, albeit one that was perhaps the first step in turning Universal's classic horror characters into a joke, ones that would soon have no choice but to meet Abbott and Costello.  What really makes this one memorable is the atmosphere provided by the great and unheralded Roy William Neill, then taking a break from the studio's Sherlock Holmes series.  This film has a wonderful look that helps make it the best of the later Frankenstein films produced by the studio (although everything after 1939's Son of Frankenstein represented a steady and steep decline for the series).

He was excellent in the role, and from that you can clearly see where the inspiration came from to combine the two strands and have these characters meet each other. Incidentally, Chaney also played a vampire later that year in Son of Dracula, even though he was completely unsuited to the part, but that makes him the only actor to play all three of Universal's main monsters. Oh, and he also played the Mummy in The Mummy's Tomb.Anyway, I digress ... here we have Curt Siodmak, writer of The Wolf Man, returning again as screenwriter. All of the ingredients are there for a great sequel. It opens in Larry Talbot's tomb, with two graverobbers breaking in and disturbing his resting place. The moonlight comes through the window and falls on Larry's corpse, waking him from his slumber as the wolf man. He then gets taken to a hospital where he is deemed insane due to his insistence that he's a werewolf, but promptly escapes in search of the gypsy woman from the original film. She takes him to Frankenstein's town in search of his scientific expertise, and there he encounters Frankenstein's monster encased in ice ... my memory is a little hazy, but wasn't he consumed in fire at the end of the last movie? Ah, well.It should really have been called The Wolf Man Meets Frankenstein, because Frankenstein here is only a fairly minor character in the story. Lon Chaney Jr delivers another great performance, at least as good as that in the first film if not better. Of course, he does only have to have one mood to convey here -- desperation. Bela Lugosi, much as I love him, is a terrible Frankenstein. He's the wrong size and shape, and he clearly has no respect for the role. Thank god he doesn't appear for that long. Although having said that, it does kind of make sense that he plays the monster, as the brain of his Igor character was placed in Frankenstein's head at the end of the previous movie. Not that they have much continuity other than that.The script certainly has it's moments, and the atmosphere of the two worlds of the Wolf Man and Frankenstein blend together fairly well, but on the whole this film just doesn't have enough interesting ideas and far too many dull moments. The set pieces are decent enough, but certainly not as striking as those in the earlier Frankenstein movies. Also, there's a fair bit of decidedly wooden acting from certain cast members, but that's to be expected from most of Universal's horror films.This sequel is entertaining enough, but it's not half as good as it could have been. It's worth watching if you liked the original.

Nevertheless, Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman is probably the best of the bunch.A direct sequel to both The Wolf Man and Ghost of Frankenstein, the plot follows Larry Talbot (played again by Lon Chaney Jr.), the werewolf, who realizes that he can't die. In order to find inner peace he is on a quest for death, and Maleva, the gypsy, takes him to Vasaria, in order to fin Dr. Frankenstein. When they realize that Frankenstein is dead, Talbot finds the Creature (Bela Lugosi), now with Ygor's brain but severely damaged. When a doctor teams up with Talbot in order to help him, the Wolf Man won't be happy to discover the doctor's true intentions.This movie is carried by Chaney Jr. who is totally inside the character of the Wolf Man. It is probably Chaney's best performance as beast, and he steals every scene he is in. As Talbot, he shows the horrible trauma of being an unwilling murderer, giving the character a greater presence that fills the screen with charm.Bela Lugosi, as the creature, has more troubles to be satisfying, but it is important to note that most of his scenes were changed as the previous subplot of Ygor's brain was abandoned. Bad choice since the first scenes with the monster show him confused and blind without giving any explanation. The poor editing is responsible of Lugosi's apparent bad performance.The rest of the cast is surprisingly good, with old friends like Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye in small supporting roles. Beautiful Ilona Massey plays Elsa Frankenstein who in an odd change appears as a cold smart businesswoman vastly different from the character's traits in Ghost of Frankenstein. Nevertheless, Massey plays the role with grace and her beauty shines in the screen.Director Roy William Neill, known for his Sherlock Holmes movies, does a superior work than predecessor Erle C. Kenton and makes the most of his actors. Depsite the plot holes of the story and the awful changes the studio made to the original script, the movie flows with a good pace.The whole atmosphere is an improvement that while it never reaches the levels of Bride or Son, works very well and give the film a distinctive look.Overall, a worthy addition to the Frankenstein saga, that even when it certainly could have been better, it is an enjoyable underrated movie. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Entertaining sequel to 'Ghost of Frankenstein' and 'The Wolf Man'...","Date":"21 May 2001","Score":"13 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  From the very opening scene in a graveyard to the final battle between two of Universal's most famous monsters, 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' delivers the goods. The sets are impressive, lit in authentic film noir style from graveyard to castle, with a cheerfully lit celebration scene in the village square providing the only lighter moments.Story has Chaney hunting down Frankenstein's diary to rid himself of the werewolf curse. Along the way the plot includes Maria Ouspenskaya, Lionel Atwill, Ilona Massey and Patric Knowles, all of whom contribute workmanlike performances. This time the creature found in the frozen ice is played by Bela Lugosi--and while certainly not up to Karloff's interpretation, despite previous comments from other viewers, he does all right in the role. It doesn't matter that much anyhow because the most important character in this film is Lon Chaney as The Wolfman and it is about him that the plot really revolves. Chaney is at his best portraying the pathetic Wolfman character within the confines of a well-written script and surrounded with an excellent cast. He creates sympathy for his Lawrence Talbot character the moment he enlists the aid of Patric Knowles to find Dr. Frankenstein's diary.In my article on LON CHANEY soon to be published in Classic Images, I quote Variety as saying that the film does a good job of fantastic writing to weave the necessary thriller ingredients into the piece and finally brings the two legendary characters together for a battle climax.The picture was such a hit that Chaney hoped the studio would use him their upcoming technicolor version of The Phantom of the Opera but such was not to be and Claude Rains got that plum role.

Soon Talbot awakes in Cardiff at the Queen's Hospital recovering from a surgery performed by Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles) and Inspector Owen (Dennis Hoey) is ready to interrogate him about recent murders.Talbot flees from the hospital and seeks out the gypsy Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), who knows that he is a werewolf, asking her to help him. Talbot wants to die and they travel to find Dr. Frankenstein. Talbot transforms into the werewolf and falls into the frozen catacombs of Dr. Frankenstein's castle. He finds the Monster (Bela Lugosi) frozen and he breaks the ice and release it. Soon Talbot discovers that Dr. Frankenstein is dead and he seeks out the daughter of Dr. Frankenstein, Baroness Elsa Frankenstein (Ilona Massey), expecting to borrow his journal that contains the secret of life and death. Meanwhile Dr. Mannering arrives in the village following the blood track left by the werewolf. When Elsa lends the diary of her father, Dr. Mannering prepares the equipment to drain power from Talbot to the Monster. But he becomes insane with the power on his hands and the experiment goes wrong. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is a movie by Universal with a creepy beginning in the environment of the cemetery and a sensational transformation of Talbot into the werewolf in slow motion. The development of the plot is dramatic and funny, with the encounter of the Wolf Man with the Monster and Talbot wishing to die. Unfortunately the lame conclusion is terrible.

There's no Dracula here, and it's actually the least famous of the three major players, the Wolfman, that takes the centre stage. Naturally, Lon Chaney Jr. has returned to play the doomed unfortunate with the curse, and as ever; his performance is good, but not to the same extent that it was in the original Wolfman film. The film was released during the Second World War, and must have been intended as something fun to take people's mind off more important issues; and it at least succeeds on that front. The plot is rather silly, and sees Lawrence Talbot (a.k.a. The Wolfman) being awakened by grave robbers. He doesn't like the fact that he's immortal and feels the need to kill people, so he sets out to find Dr Frankenstein for help. However, the doctor is dead; and Talbot finds only a relative of Frankenstein's, and the Monster...It has to be said that there's a bit too much going on in this film, and the hour runtime isn't enough to cover it all. Aside from the main plot revolving around the Wolfman and his discovery of Frankenstein's Monster, we've also got threads involving Frankenstein's relatives, a gypsy woman, Talbot's own personal battle and the common angry/frightened villagers theme that Universal horror does so well. Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman is never boring, but if the plot line could have been streamlined; the film would have worked better. The film features the only performance from Bela Lugosi as the Monster. Lugosi was, apparently, offered the role of the Monster in James Whale's original film; and I'm glad he didn't take it, as he doesn't bring the same feel to the role as Karloff ended up doing. Series regular Lionel Atwill also makes an appearance, and I was pleased to see Dennis Hoey in the film; an actor most recognised for his performances as the inept Inspector Lestrade in Universal's Sherlock Holmes films. Overall, I have to say that I preferred the later films, House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula; but this one is still worth seeing.

Poor Bela Lugosi gets ripped all the time for what a terrible job he did as the Monster in this one, but in fairness his role was severely edited.  The monster originally could talk and was blind, but the producers felt Lugosi's voice coming from the Monster was more funny than frightening, and his dialogue wasn't all that great anyway, so out it all went.  It's for this reason that the monster acts so strangely in the final cut, and the Monster was supposed to be sick anyway.  It was a mistake to cast the too old Lugosi as the Monster, but don't blame Bela -- he probably did the best he could, but we'll never know.  I also think it was a mistake to cast Lon Chaney Jr. as the Monster in Ghost.  Both he and Lugosi were too round-faced to take over from Karloff.  And the ending of Ghost was one of the biggest blunders in the entire series.  But this film manages to survive all the mistakes and still be very entertaining.

THE WOLF MAN was a rather threadbare plot and probably shows what a very limited concept werewolf movies are . The first half of the movie plays out like a werewolf movie then moves to Frankenstein's homeland and involves the monster There's two very obvious flaws to the story . First off there's zero continuity to the previous Frankenstein movie where Ygor was the monster who became blind . Apparently he has regained his sight but lost his powers of speech . In fact the story could have taken place immediately after SON OF FRANKENSTEIN and no one would have been able to tell the difference . There is a myth according to film historians that Lugosi was given dialogue where he states that his monster is blind and that accounts for his performance with arms outstretched but it's obvious in many scenes that the monster still has his sight retainedThe second flaw is the geographical location which is recognisably central Europe in the 1940s . Unfortunately it seems to be on a parallel world where there is no war even though this country has a fascist mindset where ethnic minorities like Gypsies are not welcome . It seems totally ridiculous that characters can move freely from England to this European hinterland . It's obvious by characters costumes that is very much a Germanzed country and it's strange that being a German Jewish Ã©migrÃ© Siodmak didn't emphasis an anti-Nazi subtext to the taleThat said it is a fairly entertaining film if you overlook its silliness . It does have a very memorable opening sequence where two grave robbers break in to the vault of the Talbot family .

It does end too abruptly for my tastes and Bela Lugosi looks very ill at ease, too sharp-featured and far from imposing as the Frankenstein monster. To be fair though to Lugosi it is not entirely his fault, as the character is poorly developed and written and you can actually tell that his screen time was intended to have been longer, hence why some of the story was in want of more explanation(the blindness was important and that was literally ignored). Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is a very good-looking film, it's beautifully shot with eerie lighting and the sets give off a real Gothic horror atmosphere but look sumptuous at the same time. The music fits well, complimenting the thrills without sounding overbearing and stock. The script is very witty and cohesive with only with the monster where it felt incomplete, while the story is always compelling filled with entertainment and the scares positively thrill. Especially good is the opening sequence which is brilliant, so chilling and effectively atmospheric that you are excited to see what follows afterwards, to me it is one of the best openings to a Universal horror during this period and even after. The monster brawl is a lot of fun as well. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is skilfully directed throughout, is briskly paced, the characters are engaging without being fully dimensional and the acting is mostly solid apart from Lugosi. Illona Massey is a smouldering and unusually smart Elsa and Dwight Frye and Lionel Atwill provide entertaining support. Coming off best is Lon Chaney Jnr as Talbot aka The Wolf Man who's superb, goose bump-inducing but movingly sympathetic as well. His makeup is just as good as it was in The Wolf Man.

And yet, as my ten-year old self discovered, and as my older and not in the least more sophisticated adult self realises, it's a film that really works.For one thing, it's wonderfully atmospheric, thanks to Roy William Neill's moody direction, crisp cinematography and sincere performances from the actors. The opening shot is one of the best in Universal's horror cannon, the camera dollying over a gloomy cemetery while crows hop and croak as two grave robbers make their way to the Talbot tomb. They didn't choose the time particularly well, for it is a full moon, and all that's needed to bring the Wolfman (Lon Chaney) back from the dead is its silver-white touch on Talbot's dead hand.Chaney is excellent as the tormented Talbot; unfortunately studio interference - the editing out of the monster's (played by Bela Lugosi) dialogue and blindness (until the end) make Bela's performance inexplicable to those not in the know. Happily we have compensations in the form of Lionel Atwill, Maria Ouspenskaya, Dwight Frye (back for a last Universal hurrah before his untimely death) and the ravishing Ilona Massey. We even have Inspector Lestrade turn up in the form of Denis Hoey. He might be called Inspector Owen in this movie, but he's got the same overcoat and bowler Hoey wears in his Rathbone Sherlock Holmes' movies.Talbot escapes from an asylum and heads for Visaria, seeking the secret of Frankenstein's unholy science. He just wants to die and end the torture of his 3 times a month transformations. After various adventures he thaws out Henry's creation and the two quickly turn up Frankenstein's Secrets of Life And Death diary; the monster (with Ygor's brain inside him - see Ghost of Frankenstein) is also seeking to be restored to full power.Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman even has a barnstorming musical song as the village celebrates the Festival of The New Wine, For life is short and death is long being verbal torture for Talbot. The monster comes searching for his new friend and certainly puts a dampener on things for the villagers!The climactic fight between our titans of terror may have dated but it worked for audiences of the time and on the whole this is a film I never tire of re-watching.To summarise, cheeky concept, excellent movie!

His return to life, which has been questioned, could easily be explained by the lore itself (though it's never been mentioned at all in the Universal universe) vampires are supposed to be the risen spirits of dead werewolves and, while Chaney is never seen fanged and out for blood (not in FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN, at any rate), that COULD explain his return from the grave. One thing that CAN'T be explained is the continuity problem here, again (as in THE WOLF MAN), Chaney's clothing changes back and forth as does he.

Critics have unfairly lambasted Bela's performance, but in truth it's really brilliant when taken in its original context the creature blindly stumbles around with out-stretched arms, appearing awkward and searching for strength. Lugosi had much dialogue as first shot, but legend claims that it sounded too funny at test screenings, so all language and references to the monster's violence were edited out! Let's remember that Bela Lugosi was playing the monster in a way that was never attempted before. As intended, this film would have been much more acceptable as Talbot and the monster would discuss their plan to find Frankenstein's diary and use the information to their own ends Talbot to find a way to die, the monster to gain back his strength.With great music and nostalgic atmosphere to boot, FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN is good, clean fun from the innocent days of Universal Horrors.

(Up until this movie they had done a pretty good job of doing that.) I love the village of Vasaria. All the villagers (who were probably supposed to have lived there their entire lives) have assorted accents. ALso because the background villagers dress in a Tyrolean style while the main characters dress in modern clothes. Lon Chaney's performance as the Wolf Man is actually better than it was in the first film because Larry Talbot has become more tortured as a result of his werewolf-ism.The actress that plays Frankenstein's daughter isn't that good at all.

Lon Chaney reprises his Larry Talbot role, inadvertently brought back to life when a pair of foolish grave robbers break into his crypt to steal whatever jewelry they can find. The full moon rises and Talbot is on the prowl again, eventually passing out in the streets of Cardiff, where he is hospitalized by Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles). Inspector Owen (Dennis Hoey) believes the patient to be an impostor when local police records reveal that Lawrence Talbot died four years prior, so Talbot begins to realize that his lycanthropic curse has damned him to live forever in eternal torture.Escaping the confines of the hospital, Larry seeks the aid of Maleva the gypsy (Maria Ouspenskaya) who suggests a visit to Dr. Frankenstein's castle in Vasaria for a cure. After the angry villagers there reveal that the hated Frankenstein has died in a fire, a despondent Talbot transforms into the Wolf Man and takes refuge in the abandoned remains of the Frankenstein mansion. Later, as Talbot, he discovers the frozen body of Frankenstein's Monster (Bela Lugosi) amidst the ruins and asks the sickly creature to help him find the late doctor's diary which contains not only the secret of life but, more importantly to Talbot, of death. Unable to locate the book, Larry meets up with Frankenstein's daughter Elsa (Ilona Massey) to possibly secure her aid in obtaining the records he requires. When Dr. Mannering arrives on the scene, he becomes obsessed with Frankenstein's monster and decides to restore the creation to its full power. Ultimately, both monsters come to blows in a climactic battle to the finish! FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN is the first monster team-up movie, and it's a good, atmospheric one. Beginning with Lon Chaney, here he gives the best of his five performance as the doomed werewolf, and it's really his picture. But poor Bela Lugosi has too often been unfairly criticized for his stiff and awkward portrayal of Frankenstein's monster; it's actually an inspired performance as it was originally written and filmed. The monster was intended to retain the brain of his friend Ygor from the finale of THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN, and the plan was to have a sickly monster who was unable to see and who spoke dialogue in Ygor's raspy voice. According to screenwriter Curt Siodmak, the finished product featuring a monster with an accent evoked so much laughter during a private pre-screening at the studio that all of Lugosi's speech was quickly cut out of the movie, and with it went all references to the monster's blindness as well. As a result, Bela's monster appears in the finished film to be groping about with stiff, outstretched arms for no apparent reason. I'd like to take some time to stand up in support of Bela Lugosi's effort. I'm very much a fan of his snarling characterization though it requires much defending as it's the most grossly and unfairly lambasted performance in all of horrordom. Or, at least Universal horrordom. For openers, I don't buy into the legend that Bela was probably humiliated taking the monster role after he originally rejected it. As we all know by now, the official concept in FMTWM was for Lugosi to be playing the creature with actual dialogue, and this would vindicate his early choice of passing on the part because the monster merely grunted and had no speech. Now, I'm not trying to say he wouldn't have taken ANY monster part at this point in his waning career, speech or otherwise -- but I'm suggesting it was a juicier part as scripted and shot than it had been since the days of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Furthermore, I've always figured that the monster in MEETS was essentially what we may call Ygorstein ... and that Bela was really playing an odd concoction of both his popular Ygor character and a new monstrosity, combined. This had to be at least partly challenging for an actor, and it offered the monster an entirely new persona all its own. We all know that post-editing made Bela's performance appear bizarre and unmotivated. But I can hardly blame the actor; in the original shooting script there are precise descriptions of how the actor is to portray the monster -- instructions like, walks around half-blind, stumbling, groping, arms outstretched... .It's not at all Lugosi's fault that the final version of MEETS which exists today appears to be so lame. He's a victim of an editing blunder, and at the very least there should have been some attempt made to explain that he cannot see well - even a line looped in somewhere. When others are roasting Lugosi's performance I always like to simply ask, how else does one play such a part at this point in such a long-winded series? The monster here is blind, sick, has been frozen alive for years. Ygor is trying to coordinate his brain into this new and misshapen carcass, itself compromised by mismatched blood types. To put it bluntly - even the great Boris Karloff most likely couldn't do much better in this situation, and I think he knew that a long time ago himself - having stepped out of the part a few films back already; fully realizing that the depth of this character, for an actor, was null and void by now. Bela does manage to breathe some unique life into the role. Even most vocal detractors love the bit where Ygorstein smiles triumphantly and cunningly while on that slab. I can expect all the negative impressions from the more casual moviegoers out there ... but to the more sophisticated and well-versed Universal Monster fans out there? We should know better. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"Excellent first half/poor second","Date":"8 March 2000","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  As well documented by other reviewers on this site, this should have been called RETURN OF THE WOLF MAN.   The first half of the film segues easily from the original.  By the time Talbott and Maleva reach Vasaria the film is half over and the ridiculous second half with the badly acted Lugosi Frankenstein monster (he's too short and isn't at all fierce) detracts.  The script writers weren't too swift here either  a. Talbott knows how to die - silver in cane or bullet.  All he has to do is commit suicide.  b. The previous Frankenstein film (Ghost of Frankenstein) moved the action to a different location which ended in a fire supposedly consuming the Monster and the second Frankenstein son.  While the granddaughter refers to her father AND grandfather (the original Dr. F. we presume) being cursed it doesn't explain why the monster is suddenly back in the original castle and in an ice block in the basement.    Continuity person needs to be shot.   Again the Wolf Man himself is more agile and slimmer than Chaney, so we assume a stunt man doubled.  The original shot of the monster in the ice is NOT Lugosi, nor is the stunt man in make-up for the fight.    All in all, excellent first half/poor second half.

Larry realizes the horror he causes and wants to die, but there's no one who can help him. Personally, I would consider shooting myself through the head using a silver bullet, but that doesn't really deliver a worthwhile and long enough film, so the uncanny gypsy woman of the original advises him to travel across Europe and search for the notorious Dr. Frankenstein who holds in his knowledge the secret of life and death. By the time they arrive in Vasaria, the Baron already got lynched by an angry mob of villagers and only his monstrous creation still dwells around in the ruins of Castle Frankenstein. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is a classic Universal horror production starring some of my all-time favorite actors and, even though I can't bring myself to speak overly negative about it, it's a truly silly and redundant accomplishment. Those who are expecting to see a ancient predecessor of, say, Freddy vs. Jason will be sorely disappointed as the two legendary monsters don't fight each other &#150; except maybe briefly near the end -, they just MEET like the title implies. Hence what this film is lacking is a truly evil character! Whenever the werewolf devours a new victim, he spends the next fifteen minutes whining about how sorry he is (which kind of spoils the fun of it) and Frankenstein's monster is even more pathetic as he just stumbles across the little town for no apparent reason. Larry Talbot's dedicated doctor seems to reincarnate as Baron Frankenstein for a moment, worshiping his experiments and being reluctant to destroy his creation, but this sub plot doesn't really go anywhere as it's interfered with an incredibly implausible love story. But the saddest and most painful establishment of them all is to witness how aimlessly Bela Lugosi walks around in this film... Boris Karloff wisely decided to stop associating his charisma with that of the monster after Son of Frankenstein in 1939 and Lugosi inherited a nearly washed up character that didn't petrify anyone anymore. Bela, once a highly respected and acclaimed horror icon, stood at the beginning of his career's downfall here and his further life story is one of the saddest ones in history. And yet, as stated before, I really can't be TOO harsh on this little film! Lon Chaney Jr tries really hard to provide his wolf man character with depth and emotion, Roy William Neill's direction is professional & fast-paced and several sequences are beautifully filmed. The werewolf's make-up effects have also seemly improved and the transformation scenes are the only times when the film is still a little creepy. I guess the most essential message this production communicates is that cinematic greed and exploitation are of all times! People are nowadays complaining about the overload of needless sequels, rip-offs and remakes of inventive horror films, but Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man proves that this certainly isn't a new trend.

Of the six major Universal monsters created in the talking era, Wolfie is the only one who never received a direct sequel. Instead, the sequel to THE WOLF MAN was melded together with the sequel to GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN to create this classic. As other reviewers have stated, it almost feels like two separate movies, at times. The first half of the movie is very much a sequel to THE WOLF MAN, beginning with one of the eeriest scenes in Universal history, as two grave robbers break into the Talbot family crypt looking for riches and instead uncover death by moonlight. This scene reminds me of the EC Comics that would come a decade later and is one of the best parts of this movie. From there, Larry Talbot begins a quest to free himself from his affliction, which eventually brings him to the castle of Frankenstein. You can see the basis of what would have made a spectacular sequel to WOLF had it been allowed to develop. That's not to say the end result is not, also, spectacular because rather than continuing Larry's quest, we begin our second half of the movie, picking up after the events in GHOST OF FRANK and culminating in a fight (sort of) between our two titular monsters.Like all Universal sequels, this one requires quite a bit of suspension of belief, along with a short memory in terms of what has come before in the two series. As has been mentioned many times, there were numerous problems with Bela Lugosi as the monster, ending up with no explanation for why is is blind and mute. The end result is a shambling, stiff creature who is the basis of every bad Frankenstein impression to come. There are confusing references to who created the monster and how much the Baroness' father had to do with it. Had the viewer not seen the previous installments, it would be very hard to figure out who the Baroness is and who created the monster. While we're on the topic of the Baroness, herself, her character had been played by Evelyn Ankers in GHOST OF FRANK, but as she also played Larry Talbot's love interest in WOLF MAN, Uni felt that would be confusing, so Ilona Massey takes over the role and, somehow, between the movies the character picks up a thick Hungarian accent. Adding more cloud to the continuity is the fact that Castle Frankenstein was destroyed at the end of GHOST yet somehow remains in place in this movie.All those things can be forgiven, though. What horror franchise hasn't played a little loose with continuity to keep events moving? I love this movie for the dark feel of the first half and the focus on a great character in Larry Talbot. I love this movie for the thrill it gave me, as a kid, in seeing two monsters in one movie. I love it for being a sequel two Universal movies in one. It's fun and thrilling and a monster kid can't ask for much more than that.

She travels with him to locate the one man who can help him to die - Dr. Frankenstein. The brilliant doctor proves to be dead himself, but they do find Frankenstein's daughter.

There he finds the Monster, whom he chips out of a block of ice. Dr. Mannering catches up with him only to become tempted to monomania while using Frankenstein's old equipment.Let's face it, this doesn't come close to the caliber of The Wolf Man or Frankenstein, but the fact is it remains a pretty fun movie. It doesn't take itself overly seriously, it has a good sense of camp to it when needed, and I felt that helped the flow of things. Back in these days you didn't have silly effects, you didn't have overblown CGI to enhance the monster battles, and this was good old fashioned fun. I also thought the story was above average for this sort of thing as well. For a movie that's barely over 70 minutes long, it crams in an impressive amount of character development. I was most impressed with how the script made Lon Chaney's Talbot character sympathetic. All he wants is to die in peace, nothing more. I felt it. Frankenstein's development is a little underwhelming, but Chaney's is so impressive I overlooked it.Performances. Lon Chaney is very impressive here indeed, showing the flair for impressive dramatics that he did in The Wolf Man. We care for him, fear him somewhat, and he just brought all the right emotions to be successful. His presence is also unbeatable. Bela Lugosi is serviceable as the Monster Frankenstein, but I think it was clearly an attempt to rectify a mistake he made by turning down the original Frankenstein. He did the job though. Ilona Massey is your usual actress of its type with these films around this era. She was adequate as the Baroness. Patric Knowles is not bad as the Doctor. The film relies on him a lot to keep Chaney at bay, and he did pretty decent at that. Lionel Atwill plays the prick of a Mayor perfectly. Maria Ouspenskaya returns as Maleva, and portrayed her character just as well as the last time.Bottom line. It won't make your world turn upside down, but its quality entertainment. In today's tired CGI effect, this is a breath of fresh air.

Lon Chaney Jr performs well in this one, perhaps better than in the original The Wolf Man. Bela Lugosi is disappointing as the Monster-but I haven't been impressed with anyone other than Boris Karloff in this role, so perhaps I'm just expecting too much.This film borrows a lot of elements from the earlier movies, which is not surprising given that it is a sequel, but combines them in ways that are enjoyable. It has great Gothic sets and atmosphere, monsters that we have come to expect and enjoy and the usual mad scientist, hostile villagers, skeptical police inspectors and crumbling buildings.Worth watching for fans of the old Universal horrors, this one is entertaining even if it is not one of the best of the bunch.

Sequels generally don't blow me away to begin with, and my guess was that Universal Pictures was going a bit over the top in trying to milk the monster cow by putting these two together. I suppose that one of the great benefits of low expectations, however, is that you stand a chance of being pleasantly surprised, and I was. This was actually a pretty good movie, which has a decent, if far fetched, story line (of course it is about a werewolf and Frankenstein's monster, so far-fetched was inevitable) and it moves along at a very good pace, since there's really no need for significant character development.Lon Chaney reprised his role as Larry Talbot here, the unfortunate man bitten by a werewolf, who was killed at the end of The Wolf Man. In this movie, grave robbers open his casket, but unfortunately they do it during a full moon, which somehow brings him back to life. This movie introduces the significance of the full moon (as I recall in the original, it was an autumn moon that was significant.) Chaney is more heavily made up in this one, and after some unfortunate incidents in Wales, he leaves for Europe to try to find the Gypsy woman Maleva (Maria Oustenskaya) from the first movie, who he believes can help him. Instead, she directs him to Dr. Frankenstein. Unfortunately, he's dead, but his monster (played here by Bela Lugosi instead of Boris Karloff) isn't, and the movie eventually leads up to a confrontation between the monster and the werewolf - and the monster seems to get the best of the fight actually! The supporting cast in this includes Patrick Knowles as Dr. Mannering, the doctor who first treats Talbot in Wales and then finally searches him out in Europe - and who essentially is the Dr. Frankenstein of this movie. Introduced to Frankenstein's experiments, he also becomes obsessed with them which leads to the clash between the creatures. Ilona Massey played Baroness Frankenstein, the late doctor's daughter. It's pretty good, and the story works far better than I thought it would, although I thought Baroness Frankenstein was received far too civilly by the villagers who hated her father. The musical scene at the village festival also seemed out of place to me. The ending seemed unsatisfying, as well. Without giving too much away, I find it hard to believe that either creature was killed by what happened at the end, given that neither seemed able to be killed! Still, it's enjoyable, and a good job of blending two otherwise unrelated horror stories. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Proves that the old ones were the greatest *Possible Spoilers within*","Date":"11 February 2004","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Laurence Larry Talbot aka The Wolf Man has been dead for four years,but rumor was he was buried by his father Sir John Talbot with good money in his pockets.

To impress actress Yvonne DeCarlo (future Mrs. Munster 'Lilly' of the 'The 'Munsters' TV show; 1965 -67?) and actress Mary MacDonald; Curt blurted out George...why don't we make a picture 'Frankenstein Wolfs the Meat Man'...I mean 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'?The rest is history! And a major 'B' level classic.One of the first sequels (is it the 1st??) to continue two separate movies into one ('The Wolf Man'1941 & 'The Ghost of Frankenstein'1942).Lon Chaney Jr is the real star of this movie, in spite of his 'and...' billing in the opening credits (same as in 'Wolf Man'). He's excellent in continuing his character's pathos in his never ending search to end his torment. And for the first time (unlike 'The Wolf Man') Talbot's face metamorphosis' on screen into the Wolf Man.Bela Lugosi, at 60 years old, as the Monster!! A necessary continuity in wake of 'Ghost of...'!!  but it's sad, partly because of the decision to erase the 'Monster's' dialogue. Partly because many movie-goers wouldn't accept a Hungarian accent coming from the Monster/Ygor that, structure wise, made sense, but in execution, provoked unintentional laughter. (TRIVIA the first look at the 'Frankenstein Monster' is stuntman Eddie Parker enclosed in the wall of ice where 'Talbot' discovers the Monster.) It's more pity that is directed toward Lugosi's performance, than criticism, when you realize that Bela did all he could to do to meet the demands of the role (he eventually collapsed toward the end of filming). And a fact that Lugosi played the Monster's character as blind as a result of a wrong blood type transfusion from the previous 'Frankenstein' entry.Atmospheric and Fun! Director Roy William Neil's best film(?) He directed the last eleven 'Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce's Sherlock Holmes' films). And some very nice set-pieces including the defiling of Talbot's grave, the Wolf man's first (& second) prowl, Chaney's reaction to his 4 year lapse, reuniting with Meleva the Gypsy, the Frankenstein Castle and discovering the Monster, the village festival of new wine... and the final battle between...!!!!Good double feature to 'The Wolf Man'!!

The Wolfman is revived by two graverobbers and seeks out Dr. Frankenstein to cure him of his eternal torment.  Lon Chaney gives one of his best performances and is given a chance to show more passion and depth as Lawrence Talbot.  Patric Knowles also gives a nice performance as the doctor who treats Talbot and then follows him.  Maria Ouspenskaya returns to help the Wolf Man and Illona Massey is passable as the Baroness Elsa Frankenstein.  Bela Lugosi gets a chance to play the part of the Frankenstein monster, a part he initially was offered and turned down in the original Frankenstein.  He's incredibly stiff as the monster and plays him more like a robot, completely lacking the humanity that Karloff brought.  It's doubtful that the original would be as good with him in the role.  The plot flows nicely and has an especially solid opening.  The battle of the two monsters is quick and anti-climatic with no winner.

The rest of the movie centers on Larry Talbot trying to find a way to die.  He goes to the old gypsy woman, again wonderfully played by Maria Ouspenskaya, and she advises him to see the son of Frankenstein.  Well from there on all kinds of things happen that eventually unite the wolfman with the silent hulking monster.  Chaney is very good in his role as the tortured soul waiting and wishing to die.  Patric Knowles is good as a doctor obsessed with bringing life back into the monster.  The rest of the cast is good with the exception of Bela Lugosi in the role of the monster.  His monster is not as bad as some would lead you to believe, but it is definitely a role better suited to someone else.  That is not a degrading comment to Lugosi, but certain actors are meant for certain roles....and Bela was not meant for the role of the monster.  The sets and scenes in this one are great, with the icy cavern set a real gem.

Lon Chaney Jr. reprises his role as the tormented Lawrence Talbot who is cursed to live out his eternal life as a wolf man when the moon is full. To end his suffering he seeks out the aid of Baroness Elsa Frankenstein to find a scientific method to rid himself of the curse even if it means ending his own life. Frozen in ice, beneath the castle he discovers the remains of Frankenstein's creature played for the first time by Bela Lugosi who had previously played Ygor in the series since The Son of Frankenstein. The two monsters clash in an unforgettable conclusion. It's a wildly entertaining adventure that's also rich in film history. Both Lugosi and Chaney were gripped by personal demons at the time of this production and neither were at the top of their form yet each brought enough to their roles to make them distinctive and unique. Their work here is timeless.

When Talbot changes to the Wolf Man, the two creatures do battle.First of all, the title is more than a little misleading. It seems to imply this is a Frankenstein story with the Wolf Man thrown in. On the contrary, it is almost exclusively a story about the Wolf Man, with a few minutes of Frankenstein's monster and a story arc with the doctor's daughter (played excellently by Ilona Massey).As for being the further adventures of Talbot, it is okay and the script from Curt Siodmak is relatively well-written, with direction from Roy William Neill being quite good. But it goes downhill once Lugosi arrives, with his Frankenstein paling in comparison to the work of Boris Karloff. (Much of this, particularly Lugosi's wild gestures, can be explained by the monster's blindness, but this is not obvious to the audience and Lugosi's face is just not right in the way Karloff -- or even Glenn Strange -- was.)

However by this time, due to various budgetary constraints put upon the studio by WWII and the hurried production, this just doesn't stand up by comparison to the the first three pictures in the Frankenstein series. And I say that as an admirer of the work of Curt Siodmak. Yet again, because of poor production or lackluster direction or the miscasting of Lugosi in the monster's role, this picture has difficulties. For one thing the continuation from Ghost of Frankenstein is not consistent. At the end of the previous film, the monster goes blind because of the blood type difference between it and Ygor's brain that had been transferred to the monster. That element is kept here in some scenes and not in others. In another scene we see the wolfman running about the woods without shoes on and clearly his feet reflect his werewolf transformation. When Talbot wakes up the next morning in the Frankenstein ruins, he has his shoes on. Continuity not observed. As much as I enjoy all the performances of the great Lugosi, he just doesn't fit the role of the monster, artistically or physically. They obviously chose him for several reasons. He was willing to work for practically nothing, they apparently felt that since he had played Ygor in the previous film and his brain was planted in the skull of the monster it would be logical for him to play the monster here. Mr. Lugosi was not in the best of health during the making of this film and required a double to perform most if not all of the action sequences. He also was somewhat too short for the part and even when wearing the monster's shoes, appears as the same height as Lon(Creighton)Chaney Jr. thereby losing the imposing factor of the character. I know, picky, picky. OK. With that all said, I still enjoy this film and find it to be not an attempt to carry on the Gothic style of James Whale as in the first two pictures or expressionistic as in Son of Frankenstein, but just good old fashioned entertainment in the typical monster movie vein. And isn't that what movies are basically all about? Sit back and enjoy this one.

Lon Chaney Jr. is good (as usual) as the tormented Talbot, and is ably supported by Maria Ouspenskaya (as a gypsy--as always), Patrick Knowles (handsome and a little mad) and Lionel Atwill (the mayor). The big mistake was casting Bela Lugosi as the monster. He turned down the role back in 1932--it must have been very embarrassing to him to take it 10 years later. Also, he's too small for the role (Chaney is actually taller!) and he seems really uncomfortable (understandably). It all ends up with a short climatic fight between the two.

Usually, there are subtle changes in the background, but not this time. When Chaney Jr. changes in the hospital bed, not one fluff or dimple on the pillow is different from the beginning to the end of the transformation. Same goes for the transformation by the tree in the woods. What patience! This film also let's us know how quickly and quiet group of mourning villagers can become a dangerous mob. My reference is to the scene where the dead girl is being carried the streets. All of a sudden, when the wolf howls, they become an angry mob. Where did all those pitch forks and sticks and guns come from anyway? Maybe there were three monsters in the movie? This movie also features a timeless beginning that is still, in my opinion, one of the scariest opening sequences ever filmed.

The crumbling dam and collapsing towers are really well done, especially for a non-digital era. Story-wise, the 80-minutes is okay, but for me didn't generate much nail-biting or shudders. The makeup on the Wolfman is scary and the best part, but frankly Frankie is something of a joke, the makeup more like a Halloween mask. The monster brawl, however, is the movie high point that features some good stunt work, a battle between agility vs. strength. Then too, because Chaney just naturally projects a mournful quality (check out Of Mice and Men 1939), he is again a rather sympathetic figure as the Wolfman. But why does Massie get star-billing when she really has few lines and little screen time; at the same time, the delicious old hag Ouspenskaya is largely wasted. And catch mad scientist Lionel Atwill in a respectable role for a change as the town mayor.

Anyway, rather than detail the rest of the story and ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is a fair sequel in both the Frankenstein and Wolf Man series. There are two reasons why I consider it to be fair and not necessarily good. First, it seemed like it was rushed into production. Second, I didn't think Bela Lugosi was nearly as good at being Frankenstein as Boris Karloff was in the two previous movies. Of course, both of those factors are entirely subjective on my part.

Afraid he will keep turning into a werewolf, he tells his doctor, Dr. Manering, (Patrick Knowles) and Police Inspector Owen, (Dennis Hoey) about his plight, but they don't believe him. As they decide to investigate his claims, Larry escapes from the hospital and decides to help track down the famous scientist Dr. Frankenstein who could help him. Instead, he finds both the scientist's daughter, Elsa, (Ilona Massey) and his monster, (Bela Lugosi) still there. Trying to find a way to rend his curse once and for, an all-out battle erupts that places everyone in danger.The Good News A true sequel to The Wolf Man, this one really starts off great. The first two-thirds are brilliant, following the desperate search for the cure that haunts Larry. It seems like a well-written one, in that the search takes him to the legendary Frankenstein laboratory in the remote village where they are none too happy for him to be there, and in his efforts for help, stumbles across the creature and uses it for help. These are all great and are often spiced up with little parts here and there that make the film fun. The reasoning for seeking out Frankenstein is also very well conceived and plausibly plotted. It's a great buy that really helps the film out, since it would all be lost without that crucial plot element. That also means the titular fight is well conceived, but in the end, it's one of the most enjoyable sequences in their catalog. Rather than just being limited to a few grappling moves and strangle holds, this one moves around a little and cause a little destruction along the way. It's finale has to be seen to be believed, and is one of the best moments along with the fight. It's also nice to see the creation of the werewolf come about a little smoother this time around, and they take far less time to finish here than before while also getting the same amount of worth from them. Cap all of this off with a great sense of fun and it's one of the better entries in either storyline.The Bad News There are several things in this one that really don't work in here. The most notable is a song and dance section in the middle that seems really out of place and at a very odd point in the film. It sticks out like a sore thumb and isn't quite for everyone and really slows the film down. The second half is also a little bit of a disappointment, at least until the final showdown, as it veers off course and becomes a sad mixture of several different entries in the series which don't quite gel at all. Overall, though, these are all I can really complain about.The Final Verdict It's not as serious or as ground-breaking as the first entry in either series, but the fact that it's so much fun is hard to ignore. A couple of small nagging problems keep this one from reaching the greats of the series, and therefore is a must for the fans of either creature of the series in general.Today's Rating-PG Violence "},{"Title":"A Good Sequel to WolfMan","Date":"10 September 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I Was just looking at it the other day and enjoyed and thought it was better than the wolf man much more action and suspense and the acting by Lon Chaney was great his emotional feel to the character is a one of a kind like he emphasize with the tortured Talbot like when he about to turn on the wagon with the gypsy woman talk about good acting but the story gets crazy with missing parts unexplained moments have you rubbing your head but still enough action to keep you on your seats i also liked Patric Knowles as well as the doctor mannering too bad at the end he found out too late and couldn't help talbot anyway and boy he was into a treat at the end almost getting caught in battle with the wolf man and The monster !!

At the time there were far worse horrors going on in the real world. In an effort to re-kindle fan interest the studio decided to feature two of their monsters in the same film. The result was Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman which was a sequel to both The Wolfman (1941) and The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942). Lon Chaney Jr. repeated his role as the werewolf and Bela Lugosi played the Frankenstein monster. The film opens with a chilling graveyard sequence where two grave robbers break into the Talbot crypt in order to rob the grave of Lawrence Talbot (Chaney). Talbot awakens , murders one of the grave robbers and escapes into the night. He is found unconscious in a town several miles away and is taken to the local hospital where he is treated by Dr. Frank Mannering (Patric Knowles) while Police Inspector Owen (Dennis Hoey) checks out his story. Talbot becomes a werewolf that night and murders a policeman. Unable to convince the doctor and the police that he is a murderer he escapes from the hospital and seeks out the old gypsy woman Maleva (Maria Ouspensskaya) whose werewolf son had put the curse on Talbot in the first film. Unable to help him herself, she takes him to the village of Vasaria in search of Dr. Frankenstein whom they hope will be able to help Talbot. They discover that Dr. Frankenstein had perished in a fire in his laboratory. Talbot then goes to the ruins in search of Frankenstein's notes. What he finds in an icy cave below is the monster (Lugosi) frozen in the ice. Talbot frees the monster hoping that he will know where to find his creator's notes. Talbot learns that Frankenstein had a daughter Elsa (Ilona Massey) whom he contacts to see if she knows where the notes are. At the local wine festival later on, Dr. Mannering finds Talbot and the Baroness Elsa. As they are talking, the monster wonders into the crowd but Talbot helps him escape. Mannering is curious, so he and the Baroness go to the castle. The Baroness finds the notes and Mannering decides that he must destroy the monster and help Talbot. He repairs Frankenstein's equipment but decides instead to restore the monster to his full strength and....... Bela Lugosi had been offered the part of the monster in the original 1931 film but turned it down. After 12 years he finally got to play the monster but played him only as a grunting killer with no sympathetic qualities. It's really Chaney's film and he gives an excellent performance as the doomed Talbot. Knowles makes a clean cut mad doctor and the fetching Massey has little to do but look beautiful as the Baroness. Lionel Atwill appears as the Mayor of Vasaria and Dwight Frye as Rudi, a villager. Director Roy William Neill also directed many of Universal's Sherlock Holmes films and Dennis Hoey also appeared in that series as Inspector Lestrade. Followed by House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945) two similar films but with Dracula added to the mix.

If you watch the Wolf Man films in order, his whole wanting-to-die routine is not old in this one. He has some stand out acting moments, particularly when he terrifies the happy village singer by screaming at him that he doesn't want to live forever. It is perfectly awkward, embarrassing and disturbing. This film also boasts the very best transformation scenes from man to wolf. In my opinion, the first one in the hospital bed is the best special effect John Fulton ever did. As a Wolf Man sequel, this film does an excellent job in consistency and following up on the previous film's characters. Maria Ouspenkaya returns as the gypsy woman, with Chaney begging her to help him die as she did for her son, Bela. We find out that Sir John died shortly after the events of the first film, adding a sad feeling and a further need for Lawrence (Chaney) to die.As a Frankenstein sequel (to Ghost of Frankenstein), this film is practically an abomination. The monster was blind and had the brain of Ygor. For whatever reason someone at the top of Universal, after filming this picture, decided to remove all of the monster's dialogue and references to his blindness. Lugosi, who played the Monster was a good choice since he was Ygor in the previous two films. Viewers of this film must have prior knowledge that the monster is supposed to be blind otherwise Lugosi's performance looks disastrous. As it is, it's not great, but it is such a poorly written part based on the completed version. We can tell the monster is blind when he walks into the village and Chaney comes up to him and grabs him on the arm and says It's me!. Obviously, you wouldn't do that to someone who could see you!! And on top of this, there are the usual inconsistencies between the Frankenstein films i.e. long-unknown relatives show up out of nowhere, who now are supposed to know everything about the monster; the villagers love/hate relationship with the Frankensteins, etc.It's really too bad The Wolf Man never had a solo sequel. Considering Universal made 4 mummy sequels and 3 solo Frankenstein sequels, I always wonder why they left Dracula and the Wolf Man at bay. Particularly, the poor Wolf Man. If the second half of this film continued to only follow the Wolf Man, I think it would have topped the original. As it is, this has the Wolf Man kill more and the his make-up and action are truly excellent. The whole opening at the crypt and scenes in the hospital are terrific and actually improve on the original story in how the plot is not tied down into explaining the Wolf Man legend and introducing the character. Roy William Neill's direction is fast paced and interesting. He keeps the camera moving - the opening shot in the graveyard is a true classic horror moment. The sets are perfect and eerie. The ending is fun, with a short but memorable battle of the titans. The acting is good too, with Atwill, Hoey and Dwight Frye in his last film, lending their professional, solid support. That being said, this is ultimately Chaney's film. I am not a big fan of his acting, but he really has the part down in this film and for once someone needs to compliment his performance as the actual Wolf Man. He always gets praise for playing Larry Talbot, but he is athletic, wild and rampant as the Wolf Man in this film and he really carries the whole movie.

This collaboration also marks the first in a series of Universal horror quickies to not really take itself seriously, thus, having enjoyed tremendous success with the Saturday afternoon matinÃ©e crowd. As for the storyline of FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN, the first portion centers upon the aftermath of Lawrence Talbot following his demise in THE WOLF MAN. The second half, after the resurrection of Frankenstein's monster, resumes where THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN left off, combining two elements and setting them into one basic format.Set four years following the death of Lawrence Talbot, the story begins with two grave robbers roaming about the cemetery at night (with the full moon in focus, of course). While there, the two ghouls enter the mausoleum where lies the remains of the Talbot family. After opening one of the tombs, a hand slowly rises up to grab hold on Petty Charlie (Alec Craig), while the other runs away in fear, leaving the lantern to go off in a blaze. Later, in the other side of town, Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) is found unconscious in the streets by a passing policeman, taken and admitted to Queens Hospital where, due to his noticed skull fracture, is submitted to an immediate operation by Doctor Frank Mannering (Patric Knowles). Mannering learns the identity of his patient, but is told by Inspector Owens (Dennis Hoey) that Talbot died four years ago. Investigating his story, Mannering and Owens locate the mausoleum where Talbot is supposed to be laid to rest only to find it empty. Because of his insistence of whom he is, and being a murderer, Mannering, believing Talbot insane, confines him in a strait jacket, breaking out of it after changing into a werewolf. Talbot then locates Meleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), a gypsy woman, in hope that she could help him find peace in death. She consents to his wishes by taking him to see a doctor who might be able to cure him, a Doctor Frankenstein. Upon their arrival in the German village, they learn from the villagers that Frankenstein is dead and are advised to leave. After changing into a werewolf is chased by the mob, Talbot falls through a trap door of the ruins of Frankenstein's castle, and finds Frankenstein's creation (Bela Lugosi) buried under a block of ice. After changing back to human form, Talbot frees and befriends the Monster in hope that he could help him locate Frankenstein's diary titled The Secret of Life and Death. When this fails, Talbot encounters Frankenstein's daughter, Elsa (Ilona Massey), who refuses to help. During a gypsy festival, Talbot comes face to face with Mannering. Learning of Talbot's sole purpose in wanting the diary, Elsa helps to find it. After going through Frankenstein's diary, Mannering decides on conducting experiments to help both Talbot and the Monster, leading to disaster.Also featured in the supporting cast are Lionel Atwill (The Mayor); Don Barclay (Francez); Rex Evans (Vazac); and Adia Kuzentzoff (the festival gypsy singer); Dwight Frye, who previously appeared in FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN(1935), each in different roles, is recognizable as a villager named Rudi. Maria Ouspenskaya, perfectly cast as Meleva, the gypsy woman, makes a lasting impression in spite of its limitations. This would become her second and final go round as Talbot's friend and guide. Bela Lugosi as The Monster, is not as perfectly cast in his role as Chaney is as The Wolf Man. He does, however, make an interesting monster for the only time in his career, although lacking the sympathy and pathos created memorably by its originator, Boris Karloff. Lugosi's Monster is limited in the finished product, by which the screenplay fails to give details about his supposed illness as mentioned in the screenplay. In the previous outing, THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN, the Monster had gone through a brain transplant by Doctor Frankenstein that has left him blind, which explains why the Monster here walks about with his eyes closed and using his hands to feel his way around. The very mention of the Monster with Ygor's (Bela Lugosi) transplanted brain was eliminated, as was, according to several TV hosts of Chiller Theater or Creature Features, spoken dialog by the Monster with Lugosi's Hungarian accent didn't work out so the idea was scrapped. Ilona Massey, another native Hungarian, substitutes for the English Evelyn Ankers, who earlier played Elsa in THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN. The only noticeable difference between these actresses, other than being both blondes, is that Massey speaks with an accent. Since Elsa Frankenstein, now assuming the title of Baroness, is of secondary importance, and whose character comes late into the story, it really doesn't matter.Due to frequent television revivals over the past decades, FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN has become a perennial favorite amongst classic horror fans. Atmospheric background, musical score, and Talbot's transformation special effects sequences are still great. In recent years, this movie has played on several cable networks, ranging from American Movie Classics, the Sci-Fi Channel and Turner Classic Movies. Displayed to home video by Universal Home Video, it's currently found on DVD. The secret of its success is the combining of two movie monsters into one film making this slightly disappointing 73 minute production an agreeable experience for horror movie fans.

Maybe not the best but certainly extremely enjoyable in their heyday. Back in the days before fancy CGI and digital special effects, the producers had to come up with a good plot because they didn't have all this CGI to fall back on. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is an extremely enjoyable film where two monsters meet and do battle.The film is relatively short (just over 74 minutes) which is short by today's standards but don't let that put you off. Marvellous performances from Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr., fantastic sets, a surreal atmosphere and a good plot make this an excellent film.The plot is simple-the Wolfman comes back to life and so does Frankenstein. The good thing about this film is the anticipation of the meeting between the two monsters, just like the anticipation one feels when waiting for two sports teams to play. It would've been easy for Frankenstein and the Wolf Man to meet at the beginning and spend 74 minutes beating the you know what out of each other; the actual battle doesn't take place until the end but it is well worth the wait. And what a scrap it was-the short Wolf Man (well, short compared to Frankenstein) actually gave Frankenstein a good run for his money, he actually gave as good as he got. Before I saw this film many moons ago (no pun intended), I was expecting Frankenstein to flatten the Wolf Man in a few seconds.Anyway, enough about the fight-just watch the film. It is an underrated movie which I urge any young fans out there to view as soon as possible.

Poor Bela Lugosi gets ripped all the time for what a terrible job he did as the Monster in this one, but in fairness his role was severely edited. The monster originally could talk and was blind, but the producers felt Lugosi's voice coming from the Monster was more funny than frightening, and his dialogue wasn't all that great anyway, so out it all went. It's for this reason that the monster acts so strangely in the final cut, and the Monster was supposed to be sick anyway. It was a mistake to cast the too old Lugosi as the Monster, but don't blame Bela -- he probably did the best he could, but we'll never know. I also think it was a mistake to cast Lon Chaney, Jr. as the Monster in Ghost. Both he and Lugosi were too round-faced to take over from Karloff. And the ending of Ghost was one of the biggest blunders in the entire series. But this film manages to survive all the mistakes and still be very entertaining. I've probably seen it fifty times in my life, and I can always watch it again.  It has good direction, by Roy William Neil, quick pacing and great atmosphere (especially in the first half).  Sure, it's just a '40s Universal B-movie, but it's stood the test of time.  This movie should have had a special edition DVD all its own, with a digitally restored print and extras that included stills of the cut scenes with the monster and script excerpts.  Oh well!

While none of these post-1941 films is all that bad, it's very clear the magic of the 1930s was gone.`Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' is symptomatic of the era.  Someone figured that if one monster is good, two monsters are better, and that logic almost works.  We see the return of Lawrence Talbot, the Wolf Man (once again played by Lon Chaney Jr.), who is horrified by his immortality and desperate to die.  He seeks out yet another Frankenstein heir (Ilona Massey), who, along with Dr Mannering (Patric Knowles) try to drain the Wolf Man's life energies into the Frankenstein Monster (now played by Bela Lugosi).  Naturally, things don't quite work out that way&#133;The pieces are all there, but they never quite come together.  Chaney does his usual workmanlike job as the tortured Lawrence Talbot, seeking death to free him from his curse.  That whole schtick would get really old after a while, but as of `Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' it still worked. Patric Knowles is good, going from the mystery of Lawrence Talbot to an obsession with the Frankenstein Monster.  The other actors contribute and do their best, but the whole enterprise never quite&#133; you know.I think my big problem with `Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' is Bela Lugosi as the Monster. In `Ghost of Frankenstein,' Lugosi's character, Ygor, had his brain implanted into the Monster with unexpected results.  I understand the original script had the Monster now speaking with Ygor's voice, but the studio decided the effect was silly and had Lugosi's dialogue erased.  Of course, now when you have characters talking to the Monster, you see the Monster's lips move with no sound, and then the characters reply.  Which effect would be more ludicrous the Monster speaking with an Eastern European accent or spontaneous telepathy?  It doesn't help that Lugosi, while a fine actor in other roles, just isn't a very imposing Monster.  He looks short, awkward and uncomfortable.Even though the villagers seemed to destroy the menaces of the Monster and the Wolf Man, they would be back&#133; and they would bring friends&#133;  "},{"Title":"Fairly good Universal horror movie","Date":"3 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Bela Lugosi's performance as Frankenstein's Monster was not very good.But Lon Chaneyjr.'s Wolf Man was as good as ever!The gypsy fortune-teller's appearence is a nice touch too.The plot was okay,and the climatic battle between the monsters is great!This is a must see for Universal horror bufs.

In human form, he's actually Larry Talbot, and for the sake of plot expediency he already knows he turns into a wolf when the moon is full. Which it is, during almost the entire movie. After killing a couple of guys, Talbot winds up in a sanatorium run by Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles). Talbot wants desperately to die so he can finally rid himself of this horrible curse, and the old gypsy woman (Maria Ouspenskaya) who he knew from The Wolf Man tells him only one guy can really help - Dr. Frankenstein himself.Only the good doctor's dead, dead as a doornail, killed when villagers blew up his castle in Son of Frankenstein. These same villagers are right angry that Talbot and the gypsy even bring up the Frankenstein name, for some reason. Anyway, it's not until the movie's nearly half over that we finally see the grand titular meeting, when Talbot stumbles among the ruins of the castle and finds the monster, encased in a block of ice. (It's in an ice cave, although I'm not sure where all the ice came from.) After thawing out the monster (played by an unrecognizable Bela Lugosi), Talbot searches in vain for the doctor's diary. But luckily, Frankenstein's daughter is still around, the Baroness Elsa (Ilona Massey), and she helps Talbot find the diary. Then it's up to Dr. Mannering to hook up Dr. Frankenstein's old apparatus and - get this - switch the wires so that instead of giving life to the Monster, energy is drained off of both him and Talbot. Things don't go as planned, strange as it may seem.There's plenty of that old Universal atmosphere, although the Monster's lurching gait looks kind of silly. Here's why it's not, though he's lurching because he's blind. He's blind because the mind of Ygor in one of the earlier films was switched with that of the Monster. That's why Frank's Monster knows where some of the doctor's research is and why he lumbers about with his arms outstretched, as if he just needed a hug. Here's another fun fact - when the villagers are carrying a just-killed girl down the street, demanding justice, they're all carrying torches. Torches that are, yes, unlit. Even when they're searching the forest for the Wolf Man, the torches are unlit. These are not smart villagers.Some familiar Universal horror names are here, too. Lionel Atwill plays the mayor; Dwight Frye is one of the villagers. Martha Vickers, who was in the Bogie classic The Big Sleep a few years later, has an uncredited role, as does Jeff Corey.I saw this movie as part of an interactive event at the AFI Silver Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland, hosted by Count Gore de Vol. For these showings, the Count stops the movies a couple of times in order to play some trivia or other games, with fabulous prizes. The Count is always good for a hammy, light-hearted performance. Always a treat.The film itself isn't anything to write home about, unless you're really into the continuity thing. The timelines of the Wolf Man and Frankenstein movies don't neatly dovetail, but close enough for government work, as they say. Still a cool movie, made all the better by Count Gore de Vol. "},{"Title":"Poor Larry Talbot","Date":"26 December 2014","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Universal Pictures teamed two of their monster elite in Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.

Gothic horror was one leg of the three legged stool that kept Universal Studios in business, the other two being Abbott&Costello and Deanna Durbin. The whole mess gets started again when grave robbers enter the Talbot family crypt for some night work and awaken Lon Chaney, Jr. restored with appetites still intact. After a night's werewolfing he's brought unconscious to Patric Knowles clinic and Dr. Knowles figures out he's lycanthropic.Chaney then checks out Maria Ouspenskaya the mother of the werewolf who bit him and passed the werewolf curse on to him. She has no gypsy spells to cure Chaney, but they both agree to go to Germany and look for the records of Dr. Frankenstein who was doing all kinds of experiments with life itself and its origins.After Knowles follows them to Germany and they all make the acquaintance of Ilona Massey. When Knowles gets the idea to start playing Dr. Frankenstein the usual climactic mayhem breaks loose as even the frightened villagers who've had quite enough of the Frankenstein family take some matters once again into their own hands. The cycle was getting very thin despite a cast of competent performers giving their best. Fans of Universal Gothic should like Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.

Though Franky meets Wolfy boasts high production values and some inspired moments, the film ultimately never plays above what it is an attempt to make a few bucks by capitalizing on the popularity of two iconic characters.Lon Chaney, Jr. reprises his role as Larry Talbot, who finds himself very much alive despite the conclusion of the original Wolf Man thanks to the intervention of two grave robbers who make the foolish mistake of breaking into his crypt during a full moon. Determined to rid himself of his dreadful curse, Talbot once again enlists the aid of the gypsy woman Maleva, who suggests he seek out a scientist who could offer assistance one Dr. Frankenstein.Chaney once again handles the material very well, but he is hampered by a script that is not nearly as sharp as the one he was offered in his previous lycanthropy yarn. This sequel's version of Larry Talbot requires him to often lapse into histrionics, so there are scenes in the film which stray away from the horror genre and veer into straight-up melodrama, and some of the dialogue is ultimately pretty atrocious.Portions of the film make very little sense, such as the crucial moment when The Wolf Man finds himself trapped in the makeshift castle of Dr. Frankenstein, the basement of which is apparently a subterranean snow cavern (?). When Talbot awakes in this frigid locale, he discovers the Monster trapped in a wall of ice, upon which he frees Frank and forms a tenuous alliance. Of course, the selling point for the film is the opportunity to see these two titans of terror do battle, so it's probably not giving anything away to inform you that they eventually do.Jack Pierce's werewolf make-up is darker and more realistic this time out, but the transformation effects aren't any stronger than the camera elapses used in the original. Unfortunately, the fashionable Wolf Man makes a repeat appearance, and Chaney's clothing changes are no less confusing than they were before. The initial transformation occurs while Chaney is dressed in pajamas, but once again the shots of The Wolf Man on the prowl show him clad in the same matching attire he wore in the first film. When Chaney awakes following his full-moon sojourn, he is once again wearing his jammies, which suggests that when he becomes a werewolf he not only delays his hunt to change clothes, but also feels inclined to change back before going to sleep.Though the idea of enlisting Bela Lugosi to portray the Monster must have sounded great on paper, he lacks the sheer size and physicality of Boris Karloff, and his performance is nowhere near as nuanced or effective. Here, the Monster is simply a monster, not a character, and though there is genuine historical and curiosity value inherent in this interesting bit of casting, it's impossible to watch the film without comparing Lugosi's stiff staggering to Karloff's imposing and indelible presence.A cameo by Dwight Frye spices things up a bit, but most of the film merely goes through the motions, making no attempt to add anything substantial to the mythos of either marquee attraction. Their climactic showdown is ultimately far too brief and anti-climactic to live up to the promise implied by the title, and the film concludes with a dynamite-induced flood which buries both creatures, ostensibly preserving them for future sequels.Fans of either monster will still enjoy this outing, but while the original Wolf Man and Frankenstein films offered plenty of subtext rife for examination, this outing never aspires to be much more than a disposable bit of mindless escapism. At that, it succeeds handily, but it's unlikely even the most forgiving Universal Monsters fan will revisit this misguided royal rumble very often.

But, the authorities and his psychiatric doctor, Dr. Mannering(Patric Knowles) are out to find him, hoping to return him to an asylum thinking he's merely a mad murderer needing to be locked away. Instead, Talbot is led to Vasaria where Dr. Frankenstein's castle was located hoping he could help him. Unfortunate for Talbot, the doctor has since died and he finds the monster encased in ice, blind and weak. Talbot desires Frankenstein's diary and appeals to the scientist's ancestor, Baroness Elsa Frankenstein(Ilona Massey)hoping to sell the place ridding herself of an accursed property that has slandered her name, and finds a village of people wishing him to leave. When the monster(..played by a stilted Lugosi, attempting to show it's limitations due to a loss of power and sight)bursts upon frightened villagers, Talbot finds himself in need of help. Mannering promises the village he'd disassemble the monster as his creator had pieced it together. Led by Elsa to the castle, Mannering finds a will to provide the monster with full strength due to a mad curiosity. Finding the diary thanks to Elsa, Talbot hopes to rid himself of the lycanthropic curse, but Mannering has other plans. With a dam underneath the castle, the village might decide to take drastic measures to relieve themselves of Frankenstein's memory forever.I love most of this movie, especially Talbot's struggles to rid himself of the curse that has become an obsession due to his uncontrollable killing spree. Great scene where he attacks a street copper and this perhaps, next to The Wolf Man, Chaney's meatiest role as Talbot. We do get a climactic battle between the werewolf and Frankenstein's monstrous creation, but I was never quite sure of the motivations behind Mannering who seemed very stable and controlled..I wasn't convinced that such a man would purposely give strength to such a humongous and dangerous monster threatening to harm anyone in it's way. It was really neat seeing Maria Ouspenskaya with a stronger role as Maleva, who refers to Talbot as her son bringing a warmth and tender relationship between the two. I'm not sure what happens to her at the end as the castle is reduced to rubble, but it was great seeing her as a more prominent figure trying to help a troubled soul with a burden beyond his control. Massey is a stunner, dressed very well by the costume department, under a sexy accent. Atwill is the mayor of Vasaria, attempting to keep his people from forming into a lynch-mob. Dwight Frye is merely reduced to a villager questioning the mayor of his methods at not interfering with the activities of those in Frankenstein's castle ruins when it's clear experiments are taking place. Thanks to the impeccable work of director Roy William Neill, who was a seminal artist behind the beloved Holmes/Watson films, develops an incredible atmosphere and his noirish stylistic imprint displays what he could do with Universal's studio backing. I think this is essential viewing to all Wolf Man fans despite it's story flaws. Kind of episodic as Talbot seeks a cure, meeting various situations to the conclusion in the Frankenstein castle. You get to see the Wolf Man move around more than later on, especially at the end when the beast continually charges the enormous monster. I won't ridicule Lugosi considering the infamous history of production problems which would explain certain facets of the monster not explained on screen. I will say that this must've been an embarrassment to him considering how Karloff made the monster such an indelible iconic figure, and his performance turns out so laughable due to cuts and edits.

Lon Chaney Jr. had made a good showing in The Wolf Man which seemed to have just a bit of that magic, but much of that was squandered by his appearance in this film. It's hard to believe that a writer of the imagination of Curt Siodmak was required to create this twisted scenario because a gypsy woman (famous Method actress Maria Ouspenskaya) tells him that Dr. Frankenstein can cure his lycanthropy, the Wolf Man travels to Frankenstein's castle. Thinking for some reason that the monster would know the location of Dr. Frankenstein's book of secrets, he revives the monster (played with much facial contortion by Bela Lugosi).I liked Lugosi as the monster, actually, but I would have dug on more actual monster battles like what we see in the sequel, House of Frankenstein. Lugosi's interpretation of the monster is by far the least sympathetic and in terms of the writing the least substantial. He has again become mute, for example. I guess Siodmak and the director Roy William Neill should be applauded for attempting to spook us out instead of just give us a monster mash, but the film isn't as creepy as it should be in the final analysis because we're too familiar with the monsters already.It's a nice professional and slick production and it looks good up on the big screen. But it's D.O.A. as far as the real creepy thrills offered by the original James Whale Frankenstein films or even the George Waggner original Wolf Man film.

This ending, by the way, was pretty spectacular and memorable.The movie is competently directed and the stars try their best. The mood and cinematography, though, are not so hot--the film just looks a bit tired, but it's still fun. Just don't look too closely at the final battle in the film--you may notice that in many scenes it's NOT Lugosi playing the monster but a stuntman! If you look, it's pretty easy to tell--showing that Universal really didn't care too much about this or continuity.

That was four years ago but now in the movie Frankenstein meets the Wolfman he's brought back to life by two greedy grave-robbers, Tom & Freddy, who break into his crypt in order to steal his gold watch and ring.By opening up Larry's coffin, in their lust for gold, the two grave-robbers brought him back to the land of the living from the world of the dead. Talbot,waking up from his eternal rest, murderers Freddy and is later found lying in the street of the nearby village unconscious, with a sever gash on his head, and put in the Queens Hospital for observation. It was in the hospital that Larry realized who and what he was and wanted no part of it. In fact he wanted himself dead but the trouble was, for Larry, is just how could he die or be killed since he's dead already? Going high and low throughout the countryside of 19th Century Germany with his Gypsy fortuneteller and companion Maleva, Maria Ouspenskaya,who's knows the secret of Larry's unnatural condition and what caused it you see Larry Stewart Talbot is a Wearwolf. Larry trying to find the late Dr. Frankenstein's diary about the secrets of life and death, it's the death part that Larry's really interested in, gets in touch with the late Dr. Frankenstein's daughter Baroness Ilsa Frankenstein, Ilona Massey,to help him find it. At the time the only thing that Larry found in the burnt down and frozen Frankenstein Castle was the monster, Bela Lugosi, that the late Doctor Frankenstein created.The townspeople of Vasania are a bit weary of Larry and the Baroness and later Larry's doctor, from the Queen Hospital, Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles), snooping around the ruins of the Frankenstein Castle, they also very edgy when the monster decides to take a walk through town. With the sudden emergence of the Frankenstein Monster driving the townspeople into a frenzy they decide to storm the Frankenstein residence and put an end to it the monster and everyone , Larry the Baroness and Dr. Mannering, that's in it once in for all. It's then that we get to see the Fight of the Century between Franlkenstein, the monster that is, and Larry Talbot the Wolfman. A one scene movie with almost all the action and excitement coming in the last ten minutes as the two legendary movie monsters go at in a fight to the finish as the town dam breaks, or is blown up, and floods and pulverizes the entire valley, together with the Frankenstein Castle, to dust. Nowhere as good as the previous Frankenstein and The Wolfman epics from Universal Studios. Frankenstein meets the Wolfman is watchable only because of it's two top horror stars, Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi, being in it and slugging it out. This after they made nice with each other earlier in the film and became good friends. Lon Chaney Jr's. Wolfman was far better in here with a lot more action scenes then in his original Wolfman movie two years earlier. Bela Lugosi was a lot stiffer then you would have expected him to be, playing the Frankentein Monster, moving at a snails pace. His battle with Larry the Wolfman looked a bit staged in making him look like he was winning the fight when the Wolfman was easily outmaneuvering and taking the fight to him. The Frankenstein Monster just slowly, unlike the Wolfmans sharp and quick movements, lumbered along trying not to embarrass himself by falling on his face. You can see here that Bela made the right decision not to take the part of the Frankenstein Monster back in 1931 when he was offered it and had it go to his major rival in horror movies Boris Karloff. In the end Larry Talbot finally got his wish and he didn't need the late Dr. Frankenstein's diary and notes, about the mysteries of life and death, to get it. All that was needed, for Larry to depart from his life of pain and suffering, was a couple of sticks of dynamite placed under the power dam overlooking Frankenstein Castle and a book of matches to do the trick, he died.Yes in the end, of Frankensein meets the Wolfman, Larry Tolbat got what he wanted, peace & quite from the world around him, but not for long. Lon Chaney Jr. was to come back the next two years, due to popular demand, again as Larry the Wolfman in both House of Frankenstein in 1944 and House of Dracula in 1945. Five years later Lon Cheney Jr was back again playing the tormented Larry Talbot in the Universal comedy/horror classic Abbot & Costello meets Frankenstein.

As Ygor's brain had ended up in the monster but that he went blind, thus was what was originally scripted and shot for the film. Because Ygor was played by Lugosi and Ygor's brain was put in the monster, thus was Lugosi cast as the monster in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. And because the monster's blood didn't mix with Ygor's and the monster went blind, that's how the monster was shot in this movie. The monster, played by Lugosi, was shot as a blind monster, thus Lugosi staggers around and acts mechanical. There was also dialogue shot of Lugosi speaking in Ygor's (his own) voice. For some reason, after the movie was shot, the filmmakers got rid of the dialogue and there was no mention that the monster was supposed to be blind. Thus, Lugosi is made to be ripped on as the buffoon. The truth is that Lugosi was left high and dry by the filmmakers who erased the explanation of his character and doomed him to misplaced reviews. For a review, I liked this movie. It's very atmospheric and the opening sequence is magnificent stuff. Ilona Massey isn't used well and the final confrontation is disappointing.

That said, I have to admit that this is one of my favorite films because it somehow proves to be completely entertaining.Much has already been written at this sight about how the film is really not a Frankenstein picture, but really nothing more than a direct sequel to the Wolfman. Understanding that any sequel to the Wolfman requires the narrative to be carried on the back of the ever eager, always extremely sincere but ultimately flat Lon Chaney Jr, one watches this film with the full knowledge that that will not be watching a work of art. And that is why the film works for me.Roy William Neil, working with an inferior script, does not aspire to any of the coy, cynical artistic pretentions of the superbly talented James Whale. His work here is journeyman at best and merely profecient. He is though throughly professional. His film whisks along at a lightening fast pace. He thoughly understands that this is nothing more than cinema junkfood and plays up the atmosphere. His compositions are economical yet fluid and his staging very theatrical. This film boasts the best transformation sequence in the original series and Neil relishes in the fantasy of this plot. The film may be laughable sure in many sequences, but it is never boring.In fact, I have seen this film probably sixteen times clear though and each time, it has managed to hold my interest.Lugosi's performance as the monster is delightfully stiff and one dimensional. One gets the sense watching the film, that he knew he blew it by not accepting the role originally offered him in 1931, and although he does give it a college try, the role is beyond his florid theatrical style (which served him so well as Dracula) and he self consciously knows it.The black and white photography is crisp and shadowy and on par with the best Universal had to offer at the time (notable especially in the newest film to tape transfer).This film is pure entertainment and a pleasurable time passer.

On the surface it had great potential. To begin with, it's a direct sequel to the first classic Wolf Man film, and in fact the first half hour is the best part about this movie, as Lon Chaney reprises his role as ill-fated Larry Talbot. He even gets reunited with the old Gypsy woman who helped him in the first film (unusually played by the same actress).Not bad either is the link with Dr. Frankenstein, in particular lovely Elsa Frankenstein played by Ilona Massey, who next to Bride of Frankenstein's Valerie Hobson is probably the sexiest co-star The Monster ever had.But I knew something was wrong about with the film when it kept referring to Elsa's father as having created the Monster. Yet when Elsa appeared in the previous film, Ghost of Frankenstein, her father was Frankenstein's second son. The Universal Frankenstein films played fast and furious with continuity, but there are far too many sloppy errors in this film.Lon Chaney continued to impress as Larry Talbot, quite possibly the most sympathetic and pathetic of all movie monsters. He successfully makes the audience hope that Talbot finds a way to die -- it's a wonderful performance.Sadly, the same cannot be said for Bela Lugosi's turn as The Monster. He is quite simply terrible. He looks all wrong, he has no presence -- he's too damn short for one thing -- and he simply comes off looking stupid.Yes, I know the story about his dialogue being cut out and all that. But even if his lines had remained, he would have still been a poor choice. All I can say is thank heavens he turned down the role back in 1931. The sad part is that the idea of Lugosi taking over the role made perfect sense considering the brain of his earlier character, Ygor, now rested in The Monster's head -- and next to Dracula, Ygor is arguably Lugosi's greatest role. It was a cool idea but it didn't work.This film has other problems, too. The ending is too abrupt -- in fact almost comically so -- and the old Gypsy woman literally pulls a King Lear's Fool and vanishes without a trace about 20 minutes before the film. There are plenty of signs that the editor's scissors were hard at work on this film -- the chopped ending and the unexplained fate of the Gypsy are just two. There is also, apparently, some sort of romance between Elsa and Dr. Mannering. Or is it between Elsa and Larry Talbot? Or Elsa and The Monster? Or Larry and The Monster? I give up!For fans of The Wolf Man, the film is a necessary evil if you want to follow Larry Talbot's story along, and as I say the first half hour is the best. For Frankenstein fans, it's pretty heavy going and rather depressing to see after the classic Karloff and the half-decent Chaney films. But Ilona Massey is cute at least.

When Larry awakes, he's all too aware of the situation facing him, and he desperately wants to learn how he might be permanently laid to rest. He seeks out the gypsy woman Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), who gives him the name of Dr. Frankenstein. After some more digging, Larry learns that Dr. F is dead...but his Monster (Bela Lugosi) isn't.A sequel to both The Ghost of Frankenstein and The Wolf Man, this movie is good fun for any devotee of this era of Universal horror. It's not as thickly atmospheric as their best works, but Curt Siodmaks' screenplay is good. The story is a believable enough extension of the preceding movies, and the creation of Old World flavour by producer George Waggner (director of The Wolf Man) and director Roy William Neill is impressive. The opening sequence is spooky and well executed, nicely setting up the action that follows.Chaney Jr. again earns our sympathies as the bedevilled Larry. You wonder if he'll ever catch a break. Ilona Massey has an appropriately aloof and aristocratic air about her as Frankensteins' daughter Elsa. Knowles is very fine in support, as is Lionel Atwill as a solicitous mayor, Dennis Hoey as a police inspector, and Rex Evans and Dwight Frye as villagers. It sure is nice seeing Maleva again, and Ouspenskaya is appealing in her performance as Maleva earnestly tries to assist Larry. Lugosi shambles adequately, but he leaves little to no impression as the Monster.The title fight between the iconic creatures is a long time coming, and is over fairly quickly, but it's still entertaining when it happens.Seven out of 10.

Seeking out the Gypsy woman Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), the pair of them head off to find Dr. Frankenstein in the hope of finding a solution. He's dead, though, but there's another scientist on hand for help and as the villagers once again take unkindly to someone rekindling old nightmares, while the Frankenstein Monster (Bela Lugosi) is found preserved in ice...It's in effect a sequel to both The Wolf Man and The Ghost of Frankenstein, though as would become the norm, Monster Frank is a bit part player in a film bearing his name. The film is delightfully brisk and with Chaney doing good work as the tortured Talbot - with the relationship between Maleva and himself quite touching - the story carries emotional weight. However, Lugosi doesn't look right for the role of the monster, Patrick Knowles' switcharoo to a mad scientist is ill thought out, while the big smack down finale is sadly all too brief.Nobody in the film, except maybe Chaney, was done any favours in the editing and writing rooms, but it's still a whole bunch of fun for fans of the Universal Monsters series. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Frankenstein Vs. the Wolf Man","Date":"26 August 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" The Wolf Man dominates the supernatural action in veteran B-movie director Roy William Neill's Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. Moreover, if you clock the length of time that the Frankenstein monster spends on screen, you'll discover he has only about five minutes in this 74 minute chiller. Nevertheless, Universal pulled out all stops where sets, costuming, and production values were concerned. Wolf Man scenarist Curt Siodmak screenplay never lapses into idleness and provides every scrap of information for audiences that missed the first Wolf Man feature in 1941. Roy William Neill, best known for his Sherlock Holmes series at Universal Studios, keeps everything tight, light, and forthright. Basically, there are no surprises. The villain die and the heroes survive. The Frankenstein monster gets the short shrift while the Wolf Man occupies the bulk of the picture. Of course, the Wolf Man qualifies as a far more sympathetic character, while the monster looks bizarre. Bela Lugosi of Dracula fame played the role that Boris Karloff had made immortal. Mind you, Lugosi had had the chance to play the monster in the original Frankenstein but he turned it down. Dennis Hoey plays an English detective, a role that he mastered with Neill as Inspector Lestrade on the Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce franchise. If you look closely at a crowd scene, the man doing the talking from the crowd is actor Dwight Frye who played Fritz in the original Frankenstein. The Frankenstein monster doesn't appear until 30 minutes into the narrative.Two grave robbers sneak into the Llanwelly Cemetery after dark. These miscreants break into the Talbot crypt by the transom. Inside, they search for Lawrence Stewart Talbot. An inscription on Talbot's coffin reads that Talbot died at the age of thirty-one. They discover wolfsbane in Talbot's coffin. The two thieves pay no attention to the full moon outside. Freddy Jolly (Cyril Delevanti of Soylent Green) removes a gold ring from Talbot. Before he realizes it, a hand grabs him. He pleads for his companion help him, but the craven dastard scrambles back out through the transom while poor Jolly dies in agony. The scene shifts from Llanwelly to Cardiff as a constable with 6 C and C 6 affixed to his uniform collar finds a prone man with a fractured skull. The unconscious fellow ends up in Queen's Hospital where Dr. Frank Mannering (Patric Knowles of The Devil's Brigade) performs emergency surgery on him. Inspector Owen (Dennis Hoey of Uncertain Glory) is curious about how Mannering's patient acquired his head injury. Talbot awakens and insists on seeing his physician who is surprised by his patient's quick recovery.Talbot identifies himself to Mannering and Owen. Talbot reacts with shock when he learns that he is in Cardiff. Inspector Owen phones the Lanwelly Police and the police sergeant informs Owen that Talbot died four years ago. Initially, Owen believes that Talbot is an impostor. Later, that night a full moon triggers the transformation in Talbot and he escapes from the hospital. He kills the policeman who found him. The following day Mannering and his nurse find the windows to Talbot's room open and he lies sprawled on the bed. Talbot believes that he killed the policeman. He explains that he was bitten by a werewolf. Now, he tells them when the moon is full, he turns into a wolf. Owen is puzzled. Later, Mannering explains, People with brain injuries sometimes develop supernormal mental powers that are quite extraordinary. The borderline between delusion and reality is very narrow. Mannering elaborates that Talbot imagines himself to be a wolf or what he calls a 'lycanthrope,' which is a werewolf.Together, Dr. Mannering and Inspector Owen visit Llanwelly and with the Llanwelly Police Sergeant in attendance and find Talbot's coffin empty. The Police Sergeant regales Mannering and Owen with the tragic Talbot family history, about how Sir John Talbot died from grief after he killed his son. Mannering rings up the hospital and learns from Dr. Gordon that Talbot bit through the strait-jacket with his teeth and escaped from the hospital. Indeed, Talbot embarks on a search for the elderly Gypsy woman, Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya of The Wolf Man), to help him find a cure. All that Talbot wants is to die. Maleva's son Bela (Bela Lugosi) turned into a werewolf in the original Wolf Man (1941) and bit Talbot. Now, Talbot wears the scar on his chest; the pentagram is the sign of the werewolf. Maleva believes Dr. Frankenstein can help him. Maleva and Talbot travel through Europe and wind up in a German village called Vasaria. In a tavern, they learn that Frankenstein is dead. Now, I must go on living. There's no hope for me to die, Talbot despairs.After they leave the village, Talbot transforms again into the Wolf Man and kills a village girl. The villagers launch a manhunt. They chase Talbot into the ruins of Dr. Frankenstein's castle. He falls into the cellar and later discovers the Frankenstein monster entombed in the ice. Talbot frees the monster from his chilly prison, and it shows Talbot where his master kept his notes. The character of the Frankenstein monster was radically changed from the script to the screen. According to IMDb.COM and TCM.COM, the monster talked in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. Audiences laughed, however, at Lugosi's heavily accented dialogue and Universal deleted his dialogue. Talbot approaches Vasaria's mayor (Lionel Atwell of Man Made Monster) and persuades him to arrange a meeting with Dr. Frankenstein's granddaughter, Baroness Elsa Frankenstein (Ilona Massey of Invisible Agent), about selling her father's ruins. Dr. Mannering shows up after Talbot sweet talks Elsa into finding her husband's diary. A crazed Mannering attempts to duplicate Frankenstein's experiment. Naturally, things go awry, and the eponymous protagonists engage in a smackdown. Meanwhile, the Varisa tavern owner plants dynamite at the dam above Frankenstein's ruins. He blasts the dam. Mannering and Elsa escape but both Frankenstein and the Wolf Man appear to drown.

Lugosi, who was considered for the role in the original 'Frankenstein' but ultimately dropped in favor of Boris Karloff, finally got the opportunity here at age 60. Let's just say Karloff's reputation is safe as the definitive Monster. Lugosi stumbles around, flailing his stiff arms in what seems at times a parody. There were reasons for this though, which are not explained in the finished film, and which are not all Lugosi's fault. As originally intended, it would be explained that the creature is practically blind from the experiment which ended the previous film. Also, Lugosi's version would have quite a bit of spoken dialogue. Screenwriter Curt Siodmak claims that audiences in test screenings laughed at the Monster speaking with Lugosi's thick Hungarian accent. Lugosi had no less than THREE stand-ins; in fact, the opening close-up of the Monster trapped in the ice is clearly not Lugosi. Eventually, the part of the story involving the Monster was heavily trimmed in favor of a new first half dealing with the Wolf Man. Lon Chaney Jr. reprises his role as Larry Talbot aka the Wolf Man, and we are reminded that this character must be one of the most miserably unhappy ones ever to grace the silver screen. There is a certain grim humor in hearing Talbot say, But what can you do to end MY life? in what seems the umpteenth variation of that line. Talbot's morbid yet sometimes cheerful insistence on being put to death (in fact, about the only time he seems cheerful in any of the films) is a trademark of the character. 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,' as finally released, is split almost exactly in half. The first concerns the Wolf Man's reappearance, Talbot's stay in an English hospital, and ultimately his meeting up with the old gypsy woman Maleva (Maria Ouspenskay's signature role). From there, they head to Dr. Frankenstein's castle in Germany (hell, I guess it's in Germany) to find his notebook, The Secrets of Life and Death. After a point, they are joined by Talbot's doctor (Patrick Knowles) and guess what? He decides that he can make Frankenstein's experiment a success, because HE won't make the same mistakes. This is a perennial feature of the Frankenstein films. 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' is an entertaining entry in the venerable series, despite Lugosi's lumbering portrayal and a seemingly interminable musical number halfway through the film. Though both monsters are swept away by a flood after a brief, pitched battle at the end, they would return for two more sequels and, finally, to meet Abbott & Costello.

It boasts the return of Lon Chaney in his role as Larry Talbot, the lovable Wolf Man, but instead of Karloff in his pivotal role as Frankenstein's monster, for some unfathomable reason, they used Bela Lugosi, instead.While Bela was wonderful as Dracula, his portrayal of Frankenstein's monster is just horrid. He lends much too much of his own personality to the character. His theatrical flair shines through, and kills the personality of the monster. He's more like a mute game show host, rather than the misunderstood creation of Frankenstein.Bela was a necessary element in this work, however, as his character Igor had exchanged brains/personalities with the monster in the previous installment of this run. So Bela's taking this part was a natural evolutionary step.

Curt Siodmak found an excellent 'hook' for this movie (the Wolfman wants death; the Monster wants life) and the story slowly and skillfully builds to a most interesting and entertaining climax with wonderful dialog and character development throughout.  Everyone, from the bit players featured prominently in the opening graveyard sequence to the featured actors, performs their roles with a believability and sincerity not often found in movies of this genre.  Ilona Massey brings style, class and strength to the part of Baronness Frankenstein, as does Patric Knowles as Dr. Mannering.  Lon Chaney, Jr. is at his best; his dramatic exchange with Dr. Mannering during the village festival clearly demonstrates an acting ability too infrequently tapped into.  Even though the decision to cut his dialog hurt his performance, Bela Lugosi is an interesting and intriguing Monster.  His creature is far more expressive than either the Lon Chaney, Jr. or Glenn Strange Monsters, who emote very little (and open their eyes even less).  With a solid script and excellent acting all around, this is one classic that I am happy to return to over and over again.

If you look at all the Universal monsters, you will find that all of them had a film series of their own.  Lon Chaney's Wolfman is the only monster without a series of his own films.  They were so eager to combine the monsters in the films that Chaney's Wolfman was never given the prestige that the others received. Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, is the sequel to The Wolfman, unlike the following sequels, the movie does concentrate on Lawrence Talbot(Chaney). A bit of trivia that I have learned, is that Talbot was supposed to have a conversation with the Frankenstein monster.  This would have been a result from Ghost of Frankenstein when Ygor's mind was tranferred to the monster. This would have made the movie more interesting.  Though my earlier comments seem negative, I would like to state that this is my favorite movie concerning the Wolfman.  Chaney, like always makes you feel sorry for Talbot and his curse of damnation.  Talbot is the first man ever in the Universal horror films to befriend the creature.

Lugosi was supposed to be playing Igor within the monster's body which would have made him a shrewd, dangerous creature but Universal edited him down to a stiff, clumsy caricature of Boris Karloff, for which he shouldn't be blamed. This could have been the best of Universal's monster films if some imagination and intelligence had been used. Chaney does his usual earnest, haunted Talbott performance, and looks terrific in his wolfman makeup; Ilona Massey provides some glamor as Frankenstein's granddaughter, and the villagers (There's something suspicious going on up there) become the expected vengeful mob.

Bela Lugosi makes a rather weak Frankenstein's Monster in comparison to Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney, Jr. and is nowhere near as effective as he had been as either Count Dracula or Ygor. It's not the only problem with his performance but it isn't helped by the fact that he was a much slighter man than either of his predecessors, making him far less intimidating physically. His screen time is far too limited for the Monster to be as interesting as he had been in some of the previous films. On the other hand, Chaney is again very good as the Wolf Man, though he isn't as effective when playing his alter ego Larry Talbot. Originally, the plan was for him to play both the Wolf Man and the Monster but that was abandoned as it would have been a logistical nightmare, which is a shame. The rest of the cast is very strong, including the enchanting Ilona Massey, Patric Knowles, Lionel Atwill (playing his third character in as many Frankenstein films) and Maria Ouspenskaya. The editing, however, is rather poor. In many scenes (including the Monster's first appearance!), it is a little too obvious that it is a stunt double rather than Lugosi.

Two grave robbers (Cyril Delevanti and Tom Stevenson) open his casket and discover otherwise in a spooky opening sequence (with kudos to Delevanti's performance). One of them is dead before Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) finds himself in an asylum, recovering from an operation performed by the kindly Dr. Mannering (Patric Knowles, who played a different role in the previous film). Inspector Owen (Dennis Hoey) finds him there, too, wanting to question him about a recent spate of murders. Talbot escapes and finds Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), the old gypsy woman who knows his secret when the moon is full, he changes to a werewolf. She travels with him to locate the one man who can help him to die&#x97;Dr. Frankenstein. The brilliant doctor is himself dead, but they do find his daughter (Ilona Massey). Talbot begs her for her father's papers containing the secrets of life and death. She doesn't have them, so he goes to the ruins of the Frankenstein castle to find them himself. There he finds the Monster (Bela Lugosi), whom he chips out of a block of ice. Dr. Mannering catches up with him only to become tempted to monomania while using Frankenstein's old equipment.This is a sequel to both The Wolf Man and The Ghost of Frankenstein. In the latter, Lugosi's character, Ygor, had his own brain transferred into the body of the Monster (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.), an operation that left him blind. Naturally, with Chaney busy in his signature role, Lugosi was hired to play the Monster in this film. But reportedly the effect of seeing the creature speak in a Hungarian accent was risible, and his part was severely cut in post-production. This leaves the Monster silent, except for some growling. There's no mention of his blindness either, which makes it curious that he walks about waving his arms in front of him. It's true that Lugosi's performance is awful (either because, or despite, the cuts), but he still brings the same showmanship to this role that he does to every other.The idea of putting these two creatures in the same film needed the grave-yet-tongue-in-cheek treatment given to Bride of &#x85; and Son of Frankenstein. Instead, we get this kiddie show with pretensions to seriousness. But it's far from a total loss. The photography and sets provide us with the same chills as the other Universal Horror flicks. Ouspenskaya, as the gypsy, plays her role with such conviction that whenever she's on screen it's impossible to believe we're watching anything but a classic. And over in the so-bad-it's-good department we have Chaney's violent reaction to the villagers' song, Faro-La, Faro-li. Want a truly bad movie? Try She-Wolf of London.

With the help of Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya), the two travel to see if Dr. Frankenstein would be able to cure him but the doc is dead but they put their hopes into another doctor (Patric Knowles) but he seems mroe interested in the monster (Bela Lugosi). This isn't the A quality of FRANKENSTEIN or THE WOLF MAN but it's one of the most entertaining B movies ever made and also one of the greatest, yet flawed, films in history. In terms of downright fun there aren't many movies that can match the level of craziness and overall joy that this film offers. We get the sympathetic Talbot, Lugosi's extremely bizarre performance as the monster, Ilona Massey as the sexiest Frankenstein yet, Lionel Atwill in yet another role in the series and of course the fascinating sequence where we turn MGM Musical with a song and dance. This film offers up just about everything one could hope for and that includes the wonderful climax, which is really worth the wait as the two legendary monsters do battle. Chaney is one again excellent in the role of Talbot and really makes us feel sorry for him, which is important for any Universal monster. I enjoyed seeing Knowles, Atwill and Massey as all of them add a lot of fun to the film. Even Dwight Frye has a couple scenes here. As for Lugosi, God love him but the performance here is pretty strange to say the least. There are all sorts of conspiracy theories as to why his performance is like this but I only judge what I see and his monster isn't the greatest. At the same time, the strangeness of the performance makes for a rather original view of the monster and on that level it's pretty interesting. It's funny to see Lugosi connected to both WOLF and GHOST and then being in this sequel yet playing three different characters. The same for Atwill who is in his third straight Frankenstein film with three different characters. Either way, this isn't the greatest Universal film from the 40s but it's the most entertaining and overall fun. It also contains one of the most atmosphere drenched openings from any movie.

While individual scenes are nicely handled (by Roy William Neill, at the time also busy directing the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes series at the same studio) - particularly the eerie graveyard opening, Chaney's transformation scenes and the climactic showdown - the main 'gimmick' feels forced and doesn't work as well as it's supposed to; the main culprit, I would say, is the miscasting of several key roles.Much has been said about Bela Lugosi's inappropriateness for the part of the monster to be fair to him, since he had played Ygor in the previous film - whose brain was now lodged in the monster's body - this bit of casting was a logical one but, unfortunately, his approach to the role (at least, what's been left of it) is uninspired and, frankly, embarrassing! However, Ilona Massey as Baroness Frankenstein(!) and Patric Knowles as the mad scientist (surely the least engaging in the entire series) fare no better - and here, yet again, we have to contend with a horde of conspiring villagers (led once more by Lionel Atwill, and including Dwight Frye in one of his last roles, albeit a minor one) hellbent on destroying the Frankenstein estate...which makes one genuinely wonder about who goes about rebuilding it, seeing how it's destroyed at the end of every picture!! Lon Chaney Jr. and Maria Ouspensakaya, naturally, reprise their respective roles from THE WOLF MAN (1941) - though the latter adds little of real value to the plot, especially since the aura of superstition and the tragic inevitability of the werewolf curse which had imbued the original are not as pronounced here and, in any case, would obviously not be as fresh the second time around! I wonder, too, how Frankenstein was suddenly deemed a healer (of abnormal maladies to boot!) when his name never brought anything above dread and contempt in the town (whose name alternates from Frankenstein to Vasaria from picture to picture!) where he practiced...!! In the end, the film is a most enjoyable romp (aren't they all?) and certainly important for showcasing the multiple-monsters formula - which only really worked in the superior and obviously spoofy ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948), by the way - but it's not quite in the same league as its werewolf predecessor, or the other major Universal horror outings.

Plain and simple. Why? My theory is that the character covered less ground than the other two and had more screen time. The immediate sequels to both Dracula and Frankenstein explored entirely new ground &#150; Dracula's Daughter proved an entirely different character than her father, and Bride of Frankenstein advanced the monster to the next evolutionary development while creating yet another beast (beauty?). At the second sequel for Drac and Frank, we hit retread territory, and the third/forth sequel gets the monster-mash treatment (House of Dracula/Frankenstein). Wolfman throws a party with Frankenstein upon his second outing.From the midpoint of original Wolf Man through all of the films involving the lycanthrope, Larry Talbot has a relentlessly monotonous 'cure me or kill me' attitude. I find myself begging with him, 'Cure him or kill him. Please!' Or at least write a new and original step for the poor guy to take. In Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man, Talbot starts out dead and winds up (presumably) dead. No revelations, no significant landmarks in his journey, just a simple retread of both Wolf Man and Frankenstein material. So, now really, what was the point? We've robbed the first Wolf Man movie of its power to go from point A to . . . a less definitive point A? To make matters worse, Chaney is in center frame in nearly every frame doing what little he can do to hold up the less-than-adequate writing, or in other words we're forced to watch more of Chaney and get tired of him quicker. I find this a particularly sad case considering my affinity for wolves and wolf-related material. I thought of all the horror classics, the Lycanthrope would prove my favorite. As was the case with Chaney in the role of Dracula (Son of Dracula), I didn't really care for Lugosi in the role of Frankenstein for this movie. Even under the makeup, the magic of original creation is lost to someone striving for imitation. Lugosi was a very gifted and capable actor (with a distinctive accent too); even his bit parts I found instantly recognizable and memorable (long live Ygor!) Unfortunately, playing 'the monster' in Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, Lugosi is just a shadow of Karloff.At least the rich lighting, the elaborate sets, and the virtuoso music still proved up to par with the first Wolf Man picture. I particularly liked the solo violin that occurred throughout the score usually around the gypsies. It kinda makes things a bit sadder since the technical know-how clearly shines through the poor monotonous writing, even more sadly penned by the same author as the original Wolf Man. They say when a franchise runs out of steam a gimmick will come into play in a vain attempt to keep it running. Such is the case today with Freddy versus Jason, such was the case 70 years ago with even the great horror classics. But now my curiosity has been piqued . . . if we had Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein, will we have The Wayans brothers meet Jason Voorhees? Hmm . . .

The truth of the matter is that Siodmak could not write dialect to save his soul--his dialog for Ilona Massey (Bela's fellow Hungarian) is also curiously flat and lifeless. They cut Bela's lines to appease Siodmak--a rather recalcitrant person to work with, from all reports--but obviously couldn't cut Ilona's as well.

Bela was around 60 at this point and not a stunt-trained actor. Actors half his age didn't do a lot of their own stunts, much less actors who also had severe back problems and resultant sciatica.This film also marks the beginning of the whiny lycanthrope period of Chaney's career.

Instead, we get the I just wanna die moaning we will have to endure through several more films.

A tedious clash between a movie that wasn't that interesting in the first place (The Wolf Man) and an overrated series continuing its downward slide (Frankenstein), the only thing really to be said in its favour is that we're still a couple of movies away from Abbott and Costello.The movie opens with a couple of grave robbers digging up... a dead horse, which they proceed to flog for the next hour or so. With a mercifully short running time and a couple of good bits along the way this passes by painlessly enough but offers absolutely nothing we haven't seen before. The emphasis is on Lon Chaney's Wolf Man, who suddenly isn't dead after all! That's lucky! He's in search of Frankenstein's notes on life and death in order to find a way to kill himself once and for all and be rid of his curse. Along the way he bumps into the creature &#x96; now played by a miscast Bela Lugosi &#x96; and the expected chaos ensues.Writer Curt Siodmak includes all the now wearisome conventions of both series &#x96; not a minute has passed before that poem so tiresomely repeated in The Wolf Man (Even a man who is pure of heart...

From the Frankenstein side of the family we get broken down castles, grave robbers and the village mob springing into action when a local girl is killed. Yawn!! - as the angry crowd of villagers storm the Frankenstein castle carrying torches! Sleep!! - as the Wolf Man struggles with his guilt! Snore!! - as the story supposedly comes to an end but will actually grind on until the characters have run out of every last smidgeon of steam!This is a lightweight romp, never scary, pretty dull. With a plot that goes nowhere you don't expect it to &#x96; or goes nowhere, full stop &#x96; and the unmistakable sound of ker-chinging as dollar signs spring up in the eyes of greedy Universal honchos, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man can either be seen as a missed opportunity (if you like the original films) or more of the same stuffy, boring cobblers (if you don't). There's a funny bit when the mayor tells the mob how stupid they are and that they need to have a plan rather than descend into the usual mindless rioting.

Perhaps more painful than any of that, however, is the embarrassingly bad musical number 'Faro-la, faro-li!' as performed by Adia Kuznetzoff, who pulls some damn strange faces while belting out his tune, much to the annoyance of Talbot (and myself!).

This gets Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man off to a bad start, although the production certainly looks better, more expensive than The Wolf Man. Patric Knowles returns, but in a different role (which leads to some confusion); Maria Ouspenskaya is also back as the gravely serious gypsy, though she hasn't much to do. Poor Lon Chaney (Jr.) has to sweat this whole thing out again and, although the transformation scenes are much better this time, the flimsy plot is a house of cards. Leading up to the battle between the monsters, the filmmakers waste time on hoary details and fancy talk. And what about Bela Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster? Eesh! Calling Ed Wood... * from **** "}]
