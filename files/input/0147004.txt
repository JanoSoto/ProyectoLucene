The peace she finds while playing her late father's records is the only world she's at home in. She sings the songs to her father's memory with an unbelievable ability to capture not just the voices of artists such as Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey, and Marilyn Monroe but also the tone, the passion and the quality that made them legends. This ability is overheard by a talent agent who sees fortune in her voice. He tries to rip her out of her private world and force her into the terrifying spot light.My OpinionI watched this film and was amazed. The characters of LV (Jane Horrocks) and Billy (Ewan McGregor) are just so adorable that you love them from the moment they are on screen. The performances of all the supporting players are good but the performance of Jane Horrocks is amazing. It's the kind of performance awards were created to celebrate, but got no where near the kind of recognition it deserved. Hardly saying anything throughout the first part of the film she communicates so much through her eyes and expressions. Then when she sings she does not just 'mimic' the voices of legends but proves she is a legend in her own right.

Every one is excellent, but it's the two most subtle of them all that steal the show.Jane Horrocks has proven that she can be so much more than Bubbles, the airheaded secretary from AbFab. She's more than a match for every other powerful actor on the screen, and considering her co-stars that's quite an accomplishment. Her chemistry with the wonderful Ewan McGregor is remarkable; the story of their characters could have made a gentle, beautiful love story on its own, but as it is, their attraction gives hope for both of these gentle, quiet characters. I would've liked to see more attention paid to McGregor's character, but that could simply be because where McGregor is concerned, there can't really ever be enough.Michael Caine is deserving of his Golden Globe. Showy as his role undeniably is, he never pushes it too far. This performance is another example of his versatility and his formidable onstage presence.Brenda Blethyn has become one of my favourite actors since I saw Secrets & Lies; here again, she's a wrecked mother who lives in a dream world, but with added layers of violence and neglect toward her only child. She can speak volumes with her thickly-shadowed black eyes and an omnipresent cigarette. We never get the full story on her relationship with her late husband, LV's beloved father, but the tension and the words unsaid are brought to a boil in a key scene between Blethyn and Horrocks.Come Oscar time, it would be wonderful to see Little Voice get some recognition.

And I wasn`t expecting my opinion to be swayed either as the opening credits rolled , based on a stage play and full of actors with  Eee by gum  northern accents and with a foul mouthed mother bullying her painfully introverted daughter this had all the hallmarks of a tedious 90 minutes , but the more the film went on the more I became engrossed . I`ve never seen Jim Cartwright`s play so I can`t comment if Mark Herman`s script is an improvement but what a great script it is , something that touches your heart and makes you smile . The scene with LV singing a medley is uplifting while the scenes with  Take Fat  and Trigger Smith - Knife thrower will make you laugh outloud . This is a great feel good movie with a great cast , Michael Caine and Jim Broadbent are very good ( Well they do have three Oscars between them ) , Ewan McGregor gives one of his better performances and Brenda Blethyn deserved her Oscar nod , but standing head and shoulders above the entire cast is Jane Horrocks as LV . The fact that she wasn`t Oscar nominated in the title role is one of the biggest travesties in recent academy award history Just to sum up this is a great film . British cinema experienced an upturn in the 1990s with the likes of THE CRYING GAME , FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL , and THE FULL MONTY , but these films are as overrated as much as LITTLE VOICE is underrated . LITTLE VOICE is one of the best Brit flicks from the most recent golden age of British cinema   "},{"Title":"A wonderful movie, with a few annoying flaws.","Date":"19 January 1999","Score":"27 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  Little Voice is much more than simply a star vehicle for Jane Horrocks.It is a very clever translation of a stage play to the screen, which preserves the theatricality of the original by  deliberately cartoon-like design and construction of shot, and through calculatedly large acting performances. (Anyone who has seen Michael Caine's TV masterclass on film acting, which consisted largely of advice to reduce every effect to an absolute minimum, will be amused by the sheer scale of his performance in this movie.)It is a very English movie, in that it shows something of the oppressive decay of an English seaside town. Scarborough is in fact one of the prettier Northern resorts, as some of the external shots in the movie show, but the buildings and interiors could have been shipped directly from the grottier parts of Blackpool. I could smell the rancid chip fat.It is a fine demonstration of the power of popular songs. When LV sings Over the Rainbow in imitation of Judy Garland, anyone with any musical sense will be moved. As Noel Coward said, it's strange how potent cheap music can be.Contrary to the impression given by some reviewers (doesn't anyone read film credits these days?), Jane Horrocks does not sing every number in the soundtrack. Listen to the original Shirley Bassey belting out Goldfinger as Michael Caine (Ray Say) sits in the betting shop punting precious money for LV's launch concert on some three-legged nag. Horrocks is brave to compete with the originals in this way, and she is far from shamed by the comparison.Unfortunately, Little Voice has some annoying flaws. As in an English seaside postcard of the 1930s, fat people are funny. Why? Because they're fat. Pigs, actually. Roll on the movie where a tubby gets to belt out a Judy Garland torch song.Horrocks is extraordinary, but all the other actors in the film turn in first rate performances. Jim Broadbent as the seedy nightclub owner and failed comic Mr Boo is brilliant - sad, hopeless and hilarious. Brenda Blethyn as the raucous tart and abusive mother Mari is repulsive and cruel, but also pathetic. Ms Blethyn's performances often annoy me, but to attain the heights of Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford - in a movie that is actually good - is quite an achievement. Michael Caine as clapped out agent Ray Say ranges from vulgarity to charm to vicious selfishness with utter conviction and apparently without effort. He cannot sing a note, but his raging punk rendition of Roy Orbison's It's Over reduced the nightclub audience in the movie, and the cinema audience at the Odeon West End, to jaw-dropping silence.This movie is grand guignol crossed with a postcard by Eric Gill. It is What Ever Happened to Baby Jane with great songs and North Yorkshire accents. And yes, Horrock's impressions are wonderful. Little Voice is not just a star vehicle, but she surely is a star.

It's a real pleasure to see Michael Caine in particular, in a role of a shoddy, second-rate agent who believes he's found his passport to 'the big time' in LV. That man is such a great actor.Bypassing Jane Horrocks' astounding ability to mimic people, it's also a pleasure to see her on the big screen again she does a heck of a lot of voice work, but to be honest I haven't seen her in a major role since 'Life Is Sweet'. She's a real star and can play demented, disordered, deranged or simply different people with such style...As for 'Little Voice', the story is a fairly standard setup unbearably shy LV has a talent, is discovered by the local agent, the road to riches and stardom opens... but love is in the offing, so which will she choose? That summary, however, is where the similarity to virtually any other 'standard' setup stops LV does not want stardom. She doesn't even really know she has her talent, which is completely passive. Her choice is not between stardom or love.Virtually nothing beyond the basic storyline is 'standard' here. There's no *gasp* Wow! surprises, but events turn in quite unexpected directions at all times. Many folks even complain at the end because it isn't an end or it isn't what we want. That's another reason to love the film it doesn't give the viewer a Hollywood (yawn) ending. It doesn't tie up all the loose strings.It's like life there's no tidy endings. Look past the obvious images and look at what's underneath. See the film for what it is, and enjoy.

The film thrusts us into the peculiarly flawed world of a young woman still living in her childhood home.  Her nickname, LV (Little Voice) is pronounced in her mother's thick, northern English accent as Elvie.  In fact, her chief problem is her caustic mother, played with tragicomic skill by Brenda Blethyn, who received an Oscar nomination for the role.Blethyn's Mrs. Hoff is in many ways like the awful Miss Hannigan of Annie's orphanage, who, were it not for the story's overall comic mood, would be overwhelmingly evil.  Instead, Blethyn invests the role with a horny rowdiness that helps dilute Mrs. Hoff's self-absorption and cruelty.  LV, in response, confines herself to her tidy, attic bedroom in her mother's otherwise cluttered house.Though the timid and virtually silent LV lacks Annie's cheerful spunk, both yearn for their absent parents-LV for her dead father, who appears to her, soundless and gentle, whenever she is frightened.But what LV usually does in response to her mother's constant stream of verbal abuse and generally noisy demeanor is to play her father's cherished record collection at top volume.  It is in the voices of the women on the records that LV communicates with her mother and most other people.  Though Jane Horrocks says little in the title role, when LV does make noise, it is in remarkable, pitch-perfect imitation of these women, namely, Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey, and even Marilyn Monroe.  At first, I was convinced that this was a lip-synch, but Horrocks changes the tempo and inflection to match LV's mood.  Indeed, the first thing that appears in the credits at the conclusion of Little Voice is a note that Horrocks sang all of LV's vocal performances.  Wow.Little Voice will remind American audiences of the recent trend in British cinema that embraces down-on-their-luck characters from the UK's industrial north and the shuns the charmless folk who populate Merchant-Ivory-esque period dramas.  Little Voice's characters reminded me of both the pitiable unemployed steelworkers of The Full Monty and the rotten Scottish heroin addicts of Trainspotting. Michael Caine combines these comic and serious elements into a convincing performance as Ray, the seedy promoter who wishes to cash in on LV's extraordinary gift. Caine is the foxy Honest John to LV's Pinocchio, and typifies the sense of desperate amorality such characters face when they have pawned their goods and their limbs in order to bankroll a reckless scheme.With its quirky characterizations and working-class English setting, Little Voice may not be for everyone, but the film's story is timeless, the performances are energetic, and Horrocks's singing might just knock you out of your seat.  Little Voice is a truly gratifying film.

Christ on crutches.. to call her gift 'a talent' is a travesty. Anyway.. about the film. The acting is mostly excellent (apart from LV's mother who goes right over the top in parts.. although she does manage to make you cringe and really feel her desperation). Michael Caine plays a great dirty minded but likable agent character (the man's a god - watch 'Get Carter'). I felt genuinely sorry for LV - a sweet and agonisingly introverted girl with an amazing ability to mimic other singers.

While mum is romancing(more like shagging)the local small-time promoter about town(Michael Caine,able to slip into yet another character with little effort),LV's rich,uncannily strong and facile voice catches his attention,and he sets about to use her talents to hit the big time. One who observes LV--a painfully shy girl who quietly,slowly mourns the death/absence of her father--knows that this course of action is going to be more ruinous than profitable somewhere down the line.Based on a somewhat obscure play written by Jim Cartwright--and penned with Horrocks and her brilliant vocal range in mind!--this movie,directed by Mark Herman,is a quiet little gem,not quite perfect,but packing enough charm to carry it easily. Ewan MacGreggor as LV's almost equally shy would-be-lover,Annette Badland as the near-mute hairstylist friend of LV's Mum and Jim Broadbent as an easily cowed local club owner add the right amount of plain,unforced depth that a charming,character-driven story needs. I saw this the first time as a free vid rent(love the perks of working in a video store!)eight years ago and decided to see this again and was charmed almost equally. Horrocks in particular is quite the find,both mousy and yet powerful,her prevalence over her problems,both internal and external are as rewarding as the talent she exhibits,watching this litle voice grow much bigger.

Yet, apologies, apologies. I don't have the slightest iota of a clue about who Jane Horrocks is&#133; well, maybe voice widely heard (in the UK) but face rarely seen (in the Universe). And now I logged on IMDb and am made dumbstruck by the 134 comments. Why has it never been shown in my town? Not even in small movie house. (Shall we bludgeon Hollywood to cranberry jam? Hegemonic, preponderantly.)Some viewers think that the flick does not deserve so many commendations. To me, my vote 7 goes to mainly the acting, the singing and the casting. If you intend to look for something else from it, disappointment is inescapable. Seeing the wardrobe and the look of BB, MC (funny outdated curly hair) and JB, I can't help thinking about the outrageous 1960s. Time seems to have frozen itself in sleazy Scarborough, North Yorkshire but not the wrinkles on people's faces and nor the weight on their arses. In actuality, the music and setting form an appropriate match, old songs in worn-out area.BB offers me lots of jolly good fun. I always like her acting. Her portrayal of a lonely, horny and vulgar mother of mercenary spirit is so life-like. I can imagine a Cantonese copy with roving eye, someone like the landlady in Kung Fu Hustle walking down the street in the red-light area at Wan Chai right after the evening twilight has just arrived. Terpsichore graced EM's feet five years later in Down with love where he is a dancing beau at the end of the film. If he were presented the flair earlier, he might have danced in LV's little voice.LV reminds me of Charlotte Church, the girlish diva. Her mother may not have experienced Mari Hoff's (BB) predicament after her daughter's refusal to continue to sing. Nevertheless the turbulent relationship and lavish spending of this opera babe do worry people. All her fans, though I am not one, we don't want to have The Rise and Fall of A Teen Soprano on show (too soon), it is forever good to have a prolonged The Rise to Stardom of a Welsh Cherubim.

LV lives in a dreary, lonely world with her oppressive mother, saddened by the loss of her father, obsessed with her father's records.

An almost-mute character depends largely on the actor's ability to convey feelings and thoughts through facial expressions and body movements.  Jane Horrocks does this to perfection.Brenda Blethyn is fantastic as the loud, overbearing, obviously emotionally-disturbed mother.  Her performance combined with Horrocks's makes for a dynamic mother-daughter relationship, in which I quickly began to root for Little Voice and despise Mari for first (in part) causing her daughter's inability to deal with life in what might be considered a normal manner, and then for not realizing she had done this, thus perpetuating the behaviour.Michael Caine is also brilliant as the would-be talent agent.  He managed to create a person I quickly came to dislike because of his emotional manipulation of a fragile girl he sought to exploit at whatever cost.When an actor makes you care about his character one way or another, it's good acting.  The only character I found to serve no other purpose than to establish Mari's feelings about Ray and her absolute brazenness was Sadie, Mari's best friend. It's hard to believe Mari would have a concept of the word friend.I thought the film's main climax was a bit over the top, but it did provide a catalyst for L.V. to find her own voice, as the tagline suggests.

For my money, Blethyn was robbed.  Anyhow, LITTLE VOICE is a breath of fresh air amidst mostly mindless Hollywood fare.Blethyn is the nasty-tongued Brit widow and matriarch to her husband's record store, which supplied LV (Horrocks) with her life's passion American records by Judy Garland, Billie Holliday, and Marilyn Monroe to name a few.  Keep your eyes and ears open when watching Horrocks, who quietly mimics the great starlets in her room whenever the lights go out. To my amazement, Horrocks (as revealed in the final credits) does all of her own singing.  This, coupled with Blethyn's hilarious turn as the vulgarian mother, jump starts this wonderful motion picture.  Michael Caine is the man who discovers her and tries over and over to get the sheepish LV (nickname Little Voice) to perform onstage.  LV still has a soft spot for her diseased father and sometimes has some nocturnal communication with him in some truly moving scenes.  Its really up to slickster Caine to convince her to do it.This is absolutely Blethyn's show, who is so funny and sleazy, your lips curl in dirty admiration and laughter.  One great line has her asking LV's awkward love interest Bill, a telephone repair man played by Ewan McGregor (pre Obi-Wan), if he is indeed the famous Phone Bill.  Her heavy-set neighbor looks like a wrestler and dances with Blethyn like a pre-historic John Travolta to Disco Inferno.  Blethyn provides physical comedy and a razor-sharp tongue that no doubt deserved that Best Supporting Actress nod.The climax and ending may leave you shell-shocked, but keep in mind what is being heaped upon LV throughout the film.  She is not exactly a normal person. The Caine character enters the story after what appears to be a life-long attempt to be a show-biz wiz, but has failed.  He is tired and he is ready to explode because of his misfortune.  The musical numbers are great to see and Horrocks remarkably changes lingo and dialect at the bang of a snare drum.  Just watch Blethyn and keep up with her antics.  You will not be disappointed.  A sweet comedy turns a bit serious, but for good reason.  Thankfully we get a few films such as LITTLE VOICE a handful of times a year.Rating 8 of 10 "},{"Title":"good acting and interesting characters","Date":"25 April 1999","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  Little Voice is an interesting film.  At first glance it seems to a bawdy,laugh outloud (which most people in the theater did) British comedy which it is. BUT it is so much more.  There is love story between Laura (little voice) and Billy.  These two young introverts were played excellently by Jane Horrocks and Ewan McGregor, who may be the best actor of his generation. This is one facet of the film I wish had received more attention. Brenda Blethyn who plays her mother and Michael Caine, a talent scout and her mother's lover also turned great performances.  Ms. Blethyn was great but may have been a little over the top as the self-centered, overbearing, and irresponsible mother, and Mr. Caine's performance was right on target as the middle aged, over the hill talent scout.Probably the most notable performance was given by Annette Badland, a zany, likable, and kind friend of the mother.  As I said there is also more.  There is a psychological aspect to the film as well. Sometimes it is dark and sometimes it is very upbeat.  There is also fine writing involved in that Mr. McGregor's character raises homing pigeons and draws a fine analogy to what is happening in the movie. If you like well written and acted films with well developed interesting characters you won't go wrong here.  Three plus stars!!!

And this one, much as I would have liked it not to, does fall and disappoint the viewer.Herman could have slightly reined in the wonderful comic turns in the first half of the film by Brenda Blethyn.  Her wonderfully bawdy dialogue and acting rendition comes directly from the stage version, which is naturally of a different level than film acting.Caine's and Horrocks magnificent, filmic, cinematic perfomances stand in contrast to the overblown turns necessary to project in a stage setting.  I want to emphasize that I think this is the director's, Mark Herman's, fault, not Brenda Blethyn's.If _Little Voice_ is truly meant to be a drama, it should have the courage of its convictions. The obvious climax of the film is Caine's wonderfully hurt and angry rendition of Roy Orbison's classic rock ballad, It's Over, and the simultaneous fire in which the audience fully expects Jane Horrocks' character to die, rather than be rescued at the last minute by the modern equivalent of a _deus ex machina_, meaning literally a god descending from a machine (in Greek times, a basket lowered on a rope, but in the present incarnation, a phone company cherry picker crane).Instead the film staggers on for a few minutes going steadily downhill toward an unsatisfying ending in which Little Voice's character is no longer haunted by her demons, but no longer is informed or inspired by them either.  They've been exorcised, but it leaves her the less for it.Are we to believe that all that went before was simply a prelude or rationalization for socialization with another lonely, painfully shy individual, the phone repairman Billy played by Ewan McGregor?The director's misdirection in attempting to render what was perhaps a moving theatre piece as a film is all the more disappointing because if the end had come with LV's death, we would all have good reason to mourn her lonely, soulful existence and the waste of a talented human being's life.As it stands, the audience is left with a feeling that we really _should_ like this film for all the good that is in it, even if it wanders off track completely and destroys all that came before with its trivial ending.We're left with a sappy attempt at a contrived feel-good finale which neither satisfies nor justifies the wonderful film that came before.When I first edited films, I had the following notes tacked to the wall above my editing bench  Movies Move!, A good short film is better than a boring long one, and An Editor is _Ruthless_.  No matter what was originally intended, written (the play), or filmed, in the end it all comes down to the final product.Changing the play's ending would not have been a disservice; there can be no _direct_ translation from one medium to another.The best example I can think of in this vein is _The Godfather_, which was a forgettable, trashy book but which in Francis Ford Coppola's hands became the best gangster movie ever made.The producer and director, Elizabeth Karlsen and Mark Harman, had the chance to do the same...make a masterpiece of something much less than a masterpiece...if they only had the courage and vision...but they blew it.

It is not for those who are easily offended by language, or who cannot stomach the black humour often arising from the portrayal of human dysfunction.And we have more dysfunctional characters in here than you can shake a stick at, and most of the cast have had plenty of experience of playing them. Jane Horrocks (as Laura Hoff, aka Little Voice aka LV) cut her teeth in the wickedly funny but depressing Life is Sweet by Mike Leigh, who also scripted/directed Brenda Blethyn (LV's slatternly harridan of a mother, Mari) in Secrets and Lies. Then there is failed theatre agent Ray Say, with Michael Caine reprising the misogyny of Alfie (and the weakness of the professor in Educating Rita). Ewan MacGregor (Trainspotting was about as dysfunctional as you can get, and he wasn't operating with a full deck in A Life Less Ordinary either!) appears as Billie, a slightly geeky telecom engineer with a pigeon obsession. Add Annette Badland (who she? Oh I know, she was Griselda Fishfinger in Jabberwocky) as Sadie, the varicose veined, non talking compulsive eater, and Jim Broadbent as sleazy Mr Boo the nightclub owner, and you have a real recipe for humour - but also for human torment.LV has been gravely affected by the early death of her father. Never venturing outside the house, and too timid and withdrawn even to answer the phone, she consoles herself by playing her father's favourite records, and learning to sing in the voices of the original artistes. Ray hears her singing to cover the racket Mari is making during the course of an attempted seduction, and figures that THIS is the big break he has been looking for all his life. LV at first will have none of it, but she is cruelly and ruthlessly manipulated by the villainous Ray into allowing herself to be put on the stage. Half dead with fear she fluffs it, but Ray persuades her to have one more try. On the brink of another failure, she sees and takes refuge in a vision of her father; she gives her performance everything she has and is sensational, only to collapse into near catatonia when the vision fades. Unable to even speak, she is serially reviled by Mari and Ray, who break into a fight about each other's failings. Much door banging and general bad behaviour ensues and, for reasons I won't go into, a fire breaks out. LV is stranded alone in her bedroom, singing her songs to keep the fire away.Throughout there has been a romantic subplot. There is some good gritty set and location choice (mainly in Whitby on the Yorkshire coast), and dingy lighting and camerawork adding to the general air of despair, aided by some really good direction. But it is not all doom and gloom - far from it. The humour is bawdy and hysterically funny - the scene where Mari and Sadie are dancing to Disco Inferno by Trammps had my wife and  me near weeping with laughter. And for the soft hearted (eg me), the portrayal of the developing trust and affection between LV and Billie is handled with exquisite tenderness and complete believability.The acting is universally good. Jane Horrocks puts on the performance of a lifetime, both as the young woman painfully preparing to grow out of her helplessness, and also as the variety of stars she impersonates. You will swear Marilyn Monroe has returned when you hear her - and no it wasn't dubbed. The shrewish Mari is handled to blowsy effect by Blethyn, MacGregor's Billie is charming and vulnerable (and reassuringly not very handsome), and Michael Caine - well, he plays Michael Caine as usual.Most moving film I have seen in ages.Americans may need subtitles  "},{"Title":"And then it struck me...","Date":"12 February 1999","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  When I went to see Little Voice last night, I had no idea what this movie was about. But I was not prepared for Little Voice. 15 minutes into it, I was somewhat sceptical about the tawdry, downtrodden lives of these 60s-like no-hopers living in the north of England. And then it struck me this is another film about the devastation of mental illness.Jane Horrocks plays a young woman with catatonia, an illness like schizophrenia accompanied by purposeless activity, or in LV's case, catalepsy. But she has a powerful talent she is a gifted individual who can mimic the old stars.My Yankie friends may care to note the connection between LV's life and that of one of America's cultural icons, a Ms Marilyn Monroe. Exploited and driven to (probable) suicide by a showbiz world who only wanted her for her sex appeal and treated her as a airhead bimbo blonde, LV is in danger of going down the same road. But along comes another misfit, a blithe spirit in the shape of the gorgeous Ewan McGregor who connects with LV in a way no-one else can (except momentarily Caine), and saves her from the tyranny of a shallow, prejudiced and meaningless world.Go see this movie, I recommend it.

Two shy characters who wouldn't say boo! to a goose. In the other camp - how do I put it? Well, if paint stripper could talk and sulphuric acid could walk, they would be Ray Say (Michael Caine) and Mari Hoff (Brenda Blethyn). Two contrasting camps and some very powerful performances.Brenda Blethyn is monstrously good in this. So much so, it's painful to watch. She is so nasty, my heart sank as I realised this over the top and brilliant performance was not going to spare me. The first scene was shocking as I took in the appearance and demeanour of her character. She is the true embodiment of vulgarity Fag Ash Lil meets Motor Mouth.As her character develops, you realise there are no spiteful depths that she will not plummet to belittle and berate her daughter who is far more talented, beautiful and gentle than she could ever hope to be. Little Voice's talent awakens the envious beast that's inside her mother. It's no wonder LV doesn't speak a word.Enter Ray Say, the small-time music manager who's chunky jewellery, flash car and underworld contacts can't hide the fact that he's one of life's losers. He never quite hit the big time. He's Delboy but without a sense of humour. And that's tragic. Like Mari, he tries to cover up his desperation but it seeps through the cracks like mud through broken concrete.When Ray realises the range of talent that Little Voice casually displays, he can't contain his excitement. He soon realises that he'll have to put up with her mother if he's going to groom the star that's living under the same roof as her. But Mari doesn't take kindly to being second best to her daughter and the open display of vitriol that she unleashes on LV is nothing short of the vilest verbal abuse.So that's it in a northern nutshell. Will Ray pluck LV out of obscurity? How will he do it? How much longer will he put up with Mari, the acid-tongued witch? A tongue with a life all of its own - when it's not lunging for Ray's throat, it's creating mayhem - two beasts, one woman. That in itself is a dilemma.Caine's performance is nothing short of stunning. He makes sleazy look so easy. What can't he do? He is 'Red Hot Ray' with his tacky clothes and car. His expletive-ridden karaoke at the end of the film is raw and powerful and the most memorable part of the film a goggle-eyed, seething, drunk desperado, the like I've never seen on film.Jane Horrocks is wonderful. She is clearly a fantastic mimic and is able to capture perfectly the voices of Shirley Bassey, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland. Jim Broadbent is also fantastic (no surprises there) as the nightclub host. Ewan McGregor is the sweet shy love interest and plays it well. With a line up like this, it's hard for Little Voice to be anything other than brilliant. But, there's no question about it, no amount of perfect mimicry can outshine Blethyn and Caine in this film. It belongs to them. The casting director deserves a place in heaven for this pairing.

First, it seems to be several different movies. It begins with some laugh-out-loud humor from LV's bizarre mum. I was all set for a very weird comedy. Then LV is introduced. I did not react to her the way other reviewers seem to react. To me, she bordered on mental illness -- refusing to speak, refusing to react, hiding herself away in her room like a recluse with only her records and the memory of her dead father as company, afraid of the world. If I hadn't already read the plot, I probably would've stopped watching, but of course I knew that Jane Horrocks (LV) would eventually sing, so I kept watching and waiting. (And waiting, and waiting, and waiting...) The movie quickly became a rather morbid drama. Michael Caine was way over the top as the guy who decides that LV's voice is his ticket to wealth, and suddenly the plot becomes his desperate effort to force LV out of her isolation and into the glare of a stage. It was totally unbelievable to me that a girl who panicked at the mere thought of leaving her little cave would suddenly agree to step in front of an audience and sing. Then the movie becomes yet another movie, a story about an almost autistic but hugely talented girl who abruptly breaks free of her fears and performs like a pro, belting out this song and that (yes, Jane Horrocks did sing all those songs herself), in a bring down the house performance that was, I'll admit, thrilling and wonderful. But what does she do then? Does she use this sudden great talent to escape from her miserable life? Does she at last become happy and successful, or even try? No. She mumbles and mutters something about they told me once, they said one time, and throws her career away at the snap of a finger, preferring (according to the movie) to help a strange young man exercise his pigeons, so that the movie ends as a third kind of movie, some sort of deep literary exercise that's neither entertaining nor satisfying, just baffling.

She brings the character to life with not only the perfect mimicry of the singing greats, but also her portrayal of the clinically shy woman-child living in the shadow of her dead fathers music collection.The rest of the cast harness their talent to give equally great performances. Obviously most praise goes to Michael Caine's funny, manipulative and eventually quite slimy talent agent, or Brenda Blethyns foul mouthed mother, together with Jim Broadbent giving a solid portrayal as the nightclub owner where Caine trys to 'sell' LV.Across the many reviews often very little is said of the equally excellent supporting cast. The pre-Star Wars Ewen McGregor, ever solid Philip Jackson, and even a Pre-'Stenders Annette Badland, provide quiet depth or stoicness to their characters - literally in Badlands case who speaks very few lines.It's not a perfect movie with its less than flattering view of Scarborough, despite the rather nicer shots of the town at night. Also the background to the strained Mari/Laura (mother/LV) remains very much closed up until the very end, whereas I felt there was enough to warrant it being hinted at earlier.Overall though it's so very deserving of a mere 97 minutes of your life and most definitely shows that a handful of talent can trounce megabucks of CGI any day of the week. ....

Set in the north of England sometime in the 70's or early 80's the play was first performed at The National Theatre in 1992.We join a severely withdrawn 'LV' (Jane Horrocks) and her grief-stricken mother Mari Hoff (Brenda Blethyn) in a grubby flat above a defunct vinyl record store which seems to have gone bust long ago.In their different ways, both are lost and floundering in the wake of the death of LV's Dad (Graham Turner) who remains a powerful force in their fractured lives.But within the protective shell that LV has developed there is a special, private metamorphosis occurring which is not evident to begin with. A visit from the telephone engineers George (Philip Jackson) and Billy (Ewan McGregor) marks the slow beginning of a return to normal service.It's not long before Mari hooks up with small-time theatrical agent Ray Say (Michael Caine) who hears LV singing to her absent father and immediately casts her in the role of the big discovery he has always been waiting for.Prematurely booking her for Saturday night at a local club run by glitzy Mr Boo (Jim Broadbent), LV gives an astonishing and cathartic performance as a variety of female vocalists from her lost father's heyday. But she is in no state of mind for stardom.Cranking up the pace, dodgy Ray books her and a full orchestra for the following week and invites London impresario Bunnie Morris (Alex Norton) along, but the performance takes a different turn altogether.A sudden fire at the flat - which has by now become a mausoleum to her missing father - finally unites her with Billy in the sanctuary of his pigeon loft.

The performances are invariably good and some are outstanding.  Jane Horrocks is fine as the wimpy blonde who curls up with her record collection and lives in a fantasy world of her own making, hardly able to speak, unable even to look directly at anyone else.  She looks a little like Kate Blanchett.  Her mother is even better because she's thrown off the reins.  She's an overweight, sleazily dressed, overly made-up, stern-featured, libidinous late-middle-aged narcissist who is all mouth -- and what a mouth.  She follows behind Michael Caine and his friend, Boo, as they stroll towards Caine's flashy car, and she's shouting loudly at them, calling them the kinds of names that can't be printed.  Caine sweeps his hand proudly towards his parked car and says, Beautiful job, isn't she?  Says Boo  She might be, except for that mouth of hers.Michael Caine is as good as he's ever been.  He seems a semi-decrepit wreck but an extremely funny one.  Towards the beginning, Horrocks' mother challenges him to a twist and Caine really gets into it.  Watch his face while they dance.  Dead serious.  His eyes are bulging and puffy, his lower lip droops pendulously, as he stares down at their pelvises and concentrates on getting it right.  What a professional!Another good thing about the movie is the script, the dialogue that is, not the plot per se, which is rather elementary.  The dialogue is  filled with obscenities, sometimes muttered in an almost unintelligible Norhern dialect.  And there are casually tossed-off witticisms in between the curses.  Watching the passed-out Horrocks being carried off stage (she's fainted from fright), Boo, the Club Manager, remarks  And the meek shall inherit the earth.  But when, eh?  I realize it's not hilarious but the line is quickly disposed of, and all the dialogue is treated pretty much the same way.  And I don't want to give too many examples anyway.The end doesn't really do very much.  People get drunk and mean, as if the writers thought they'd better get serious sometime around this point.  There is a fire.  Horrocks may wind up consumed by the conflagration.  I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.  But her boyfriend bursts through the window, and although her record collection is destroyed, so it seems is her rich fantasy life, to be replaced with a real life tending pigeons with her innamorato.  Her manipulators get more or less what they deserve, which is too bad because although they were rogues, they weren't dislikable ones.

Brenda Blethyn's performance was also quite good.  I was glad I had the DVD so that I could put the dialog up on the screen.  She speaks with such a heavy accent that I missed half the words the first time.  Jim Broadbent was his usual talented self, and Ewan MacGregor was , well, Ewan MacGregor. I have read a few other comments, and I have to disagree with whoever didn't like the ending!  SPOILER...if they had made LV a famous singer, it wouldn't ring true to her character!  Somehow, I think a quiet life with her pigeon loving boyfriend would be more her speed.

Don't be fooled by the cutesy cover art, the heart of this story lies in some pretty dark places. What it fulminates into is, a first rate movie that runs the cinematic gauntlet from pathos to comedy to drama like an Olympic athlete. LITTLE VOICE shows the hopes, dreams and struggles, and the devastating effect they can have when fame and fortune fall asunder. Kudos to the top notch cast, for putting out exacting performances. Jim Broadbent, as Mr. Boo, was phenomenal. Michael Caine is perfectly sleazy, and wonderful, all at the same time. Brenda Blethyn (in a well deserved Oscar nominated role) is desperate, bitchy and longing for anything to come her way. Jane Horrocks is great as the introverted, almost autistic daughter. Her singing talent is incredible. There will be those who don't appreciate a peek into the rather seamy side of life. Those that do, will be more than rewarded with this fine motion picture.

This movie is also a real surprise packet though. I can't say I expected much from a movie about someone who sings show tunes but this was a rather pleasing affair. Jane Horrocks is best known as the airheaded Bubble on Absolutely Fabulous. Here she plays an entirely different character as the painfully shy LV who grows up singing along to her dad's show tunes records in her bedroom.Living at home with a totally overbearing mother, she hardly leaves her bedroom when one day Ray Say (Michael Caine), one of her mum's one night stands hears her singing. He is intent on making her a star for not entirely selfless reasons. This however is not as simple as booking her gigs and getting publicity. Much more is involved in actually getting LV to sing on stage. Ray may not have many talents but he can smooth talk and so eventually gets her to agree.There are some very good performances in this movie, particularly from Michael Caine as the initially well meaning manager who very quickly becomes a ratbag when he gets the first inklings of becoming big with LV's act. Michael Caine has done his fair share of real stinkers but when he's good he's better than most. Then there's Jane Horrocks performance as LV which may not be that outstanding acting wise but her singing is truly amazing here. The standout performance though comes from Jim Broadbent as Mister Boo, the owner of the nightclub where LV performs. He tells really bad jokes, introduces even worse acts and and wears horrid clothes. This was a bit reminiscent of Alexei Sayle's Bobby Chariot character but Jim Broadbent doesn't look down on this character. Instead he makes him quite likeable. Brenda Blethyn is good as well as LV's mum who wears way too much make up and is LOUD in every sense. It would have taken a bit of courage to play a character that is despicable in every sense like this.This story was written around Jane Horrocks talent of impersonating singers like Shirley Bassey, Marylin Monroe or Judy Garland and while this may not be to everyone's taste, it comes of remarkably well here.

She plays the agoraphobic LV, still mourning the loss of her dad in the crumbling record shop which she shares with her blousy mum (Brenda Blethyn).When her latest lover, Ray Say,(Michael Caine) arrives on the scene, LV finds her life turned upside down. Say is a washed up showbiz promoter who knows a star when he sees one and thinks LV could be the next big thing.Trouble is, LV thinks Ray is a nutter and will hardly come out of her bedroom let alone make a shot at the big time. As with Mark Herman's previous movie, Brassed Off, this is a solid, human story with fine turns from all concerned. The supporting cast, including Jim Broadbent and Ewan McGregor make the film come alive while Annette Badland is a hoot as Blethyn's friend.A little too stagey at times but it scarcely matters.

Jane Horrocks gives an amazing performance as Laura, the shy girl with, as it turns out, a very big voice and the uncanny ability to mimic Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe, among others, to perfection.  She lives with her mother, Mari (Brenda Blethyn), a vociferous floozy, in an apartment above their small record store.  Laura (whom Mari calls `L.V.' because of her retiring manner and the fact that she rarely speaks above a whisper), spends an inordinate amount of time retreating from her mother to the sanctuary of her bedroom and her dad's records, where she immerses herself into the music, as well as the persona, of whichever artist she is listening to at the time.  For the most part she is ignored by her mother, who also dismisses L.V.'s talent purely out of disregard.   	Enter Ray Say (Michael Caine), a sleazy, contemptuous, small time theatrical agent, who is picked up and dragged home one night by Mari.  It isn't long, of course, before he discovers L.V.  When he hears Judy Garland's voice coming from her bedroom, he thinks he's found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow; this has The Big Time written all over it.  All he has to do now is figure out how to get L.V., the veritable recluse, up in front of an audience. 	Adapted for the screen by Mark Herman, from Jim Cartwright's play `The Rise and Fall of Little Voice' (written originally to showcase Horrock's unique talents), the success of the movie is assured by a cast that delivers quality performances all around.  Jane Horrocks does all of her own singing, and when she finally breaks loose it is truly a delight.  And Herman must be given credit for not allowing it to be over done; he gives you just enough of L.V. to keep it exciting and leave you wanting more.  Michael Caine gives an inspired performance that easily should have won him an Oscar.  His Ray Say is so finely shaded that you know exactly who and what he is, yet he manages to overlay him with a smarmy, irresistible charm that keeps him accessible.  His rendering of Roy Orbison's `It's Over' is an unforgettable cinematic moment.  Brenda Blethyn is outstanding as well, making Mari just unlikable enough that you can still empathize with her when she finally gets her comeuppance.  Ewan McGregor adds a subtle charm to the film as Billy, the telephone repairman who finds a kindred spirit in L.V, and Jim Broadbent gives a humorous turn as Mr. Boo, owner of the venue Ray engages for L.V.'s debut.   	Rounding out the supporting cast are Philip Jackson (George), Annette Badland (Sadie), Fred Feast (Arthur) and Graham Turner (L.V.'s father).  Funny, and touching as well, `Little Voice' is solid entertainment well presented.  It's one you're going to remember, even after, as Ray Say says, `It's over.'  I rate this one 9/10.

It would be a shame because this film offers so much more to the emotions and, surprisingly, to the character.  It is a unique work, combining introspect and exuberant expression, delivered through innovative displays of seemingly timeless ideals.  It tells us, perhaps, that while beauty and wonder can be found in nostalgia, there might be more to be found in expressing oneself through it.  It also tells us that, while grim hardship and sparse opportunities may be at hand, there are many wonderful moments to be found. Certainly these are not new ideas, but they are delivered in such a sensitive and delightful way that the is possible for the viewer to feel freshly inspired by them.  Jane Horrocks has been deservedly lauded for her performance (not to mention her impeccable replicas of some of the century's best-known voices), but the rest of the cast, especially a marvelous Brenda Blethyn, are instrumental in conveying the film's bright messages. Little Voice is also thoroughly respectable in less conceptual terms. The performance scene featuring Horrocks in all her impersonating glory is nothing short of exceptional it is easy to see why she was one of the biggest things to happen to London theatre in years.

Action films dominate screens all across America to give movie-goers a thrill ride.  But, when a powerful film like this comes along, it should be seen on a huge screen, with lots of sound - only a real theater can do it justice.This is not a quiet film, nor is it meant to be.  These are some gut-wrenching performances.  The characters are not cookie cut-outs, though many people seem to disagree with me.  After reading previous comments on this film, I am hugely disappointed to see how many Brits disliked it or felt it stereotypical.  Ludicrous!  These are the same people who made Spice Girls and Oasis hugely popular!  Are you kidding?The people who ripped it apart need to rethink their words or perhaps study the film.  Of course we all know the ending before it starts, there is no doubt where LV will end up.  But, the journey there is the interesting part. Sometimes the road less taken is the one that makes all the difference in our lives.  I urge anyone who truly loves a well-written, well-acted movie to run to the theaters before this one is gone!  See it with someone you love, see it alone, just see it for yourself.  Draw your own conclusions!Maybe I was better off not knowing the premise of the film before seeing it, I went into it without any preconceived notions.  I am only sorry that it was not lauded at the Oscars.  I think these performances were stand-outs for Michael, Brenda, Jane, Ewan, and Jim.  This film has heart and soul!

Other notable performances came from Brenda Blethyn and Jim Broadbent.  I found the character of LV less well developed and less than believable.  Jane Horrocks singing is amazing and she manages the transformation from one persona to the other brilliantly.  But she doesn't have the opportunities of other members of the cast to demonstrate her obvious talents.I left the cinema having really enjoyed the film but wishing that the central part had been more substantial.  It races along at breakneck speed from the first time that Ray hears her sing to her refusal to perform for the second time.  I was left wondering why she had really remained mute, what was the relationship between her and her father, and between her father and mother, who must have been an ill-matched couple.The film could be considered grim, but there is much to laugh at.  The failure of most of the characters to escape from their unhappy and shallow lives is  depressing, but there is hope for LV, once her record collection is destroyed and she emerges from her self imposed isolation.

Michael Caine does a great job (as usual) playing the sleazy agent who discovers LV and pushes her onto the stage.My main complaint is that too much time was spent on her mother's loud-mouth carrying on and too little time was spent showing LV on stage.

The basic premise of the film is of a character, LV, who after her father's death, becomes a recluse whose sole pleasure in life is listening to, and imitating the singers of old records. In contrast to LV, we have her dominating mother, Mari (Blethyn), who likes nothing more than going out for a good time with her many gentleman friends, one of which is local talent spotter, Ray Say (Caine). One night, Ray listens to LV sing and not only hears the sound of her perfect voice, but the sound of cash registers ringing&#133; The film progresses to show the whirlwind of frenzy that whips up around LV's extraordinary talent, with Mari, the ever-present Ray, and local Night-club owner Mr Boo (Jim Broadbent) all attempting to cash in on LV's voice. A romantic sub-plot is thrown in for good measure, with local pigeon fancier Billy, Ewan McGregor, attempting to woo LV. Overall, Little Voice will please many people with its earthy characters, who aren't afraid to use colourful language, and powerful song renditions by Horrocks, who before this film was known to many as Bubble in BBC's Absolutely Fabulous. You'll be surprised to learn, as I did, that Horrocks performed all her own songs in the film, and her vocal likeness to stars such as Shirley Bassey and Judy Garland is extraordinary. The only criticisms that could be levelled at Little Voice are Michael Caine's appalling version of the Roy Orbison hit &#145;It's Over' and the weak ending, which would have been better if Blethyn's character found solace. In conclusion then, Little Voice marks the start of a promising year for both British film and talent alongside what looks likely to be a good year for film anyway, with Nicolas Cage in &#145;8MM' and Frank Darabont's follow up to the Shawshank Redemption, &#145;The Green Mile'.

Blethyn, Caine and McGregor are all wonderful, but the spotlight absolutely belongs to Jane Horrocks.  Her vivid, fleshed out, three dimensional Little Voice character is the ultimate underdog, but she plays her with such pathos and charm that she never enters the maudlin, hackneyed territory that might have come easily to other actors.  And most impressive is her amazing singing - Horrocks herself sings every note of every song in the film, and the impersonations/tributes to the likes of Billie Holiday, Shirley Bassey and Judy Garland are jaw-dropping.

I love Netflix for that reason. I found Little Voice and after reading the description thought this would be a Pygmalion-like movie. Sure, it has elements of Pygmalion but it's much darker, quirkier with an ending that's as far from My Fair Lady as you can get. Jane Horrocks is magnificent in the title role, LV. Rather than merely being painfully shy, LV seems slightly abnormal actually - perhaps even slightly challenged. If the movie is released today, a psychologist might provide a more accurate assessment of LV's mental condition. I'm mentioning this point because the only critique I have for this film is the unrealistic relationship between Billy (Ewan McGregro) and LV. While McGregor is always wonderful, I wasn't sure why Billy would have such interest in this oddly immature, challenged LV - I think that part/relationship of the film could have been better developed. But this is still a minor critique of the film. It's a bizarrely sad story that's elegantly told. And...of course, I love British casting of movies. The interesting, worn faces of Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn, Jim Broadbent add so much to each character. I highly recommend.

It's rare to find a film which doesn't outstay its welcome and is uniformly well-acted by an impossible to better cast.The 'Little Voice' (LV) of the title is Jane Horrocks, a shy girl in a Yorkshire coastal town. She's often mute and introverted to the point of rarely leaving her room. Since the death of her father, she's had no real conversation with anyone - her only company being the show tunes from her father's LP collection of(Judy Garland, mostly). Horrocks sounds astonishingly like the real things - she belts out 'Big Spender' as if Shirley Bassey was there on the soundtrack. Her blank look is touching. If she rarely speaks it's because she can't get a word in edge ways because of her loud and monstrous mother played by Brenda Blethyn - who is best described as a pantomime dame crossed with a tart.Then there's Michael Caine as Ray Say, the has-been agent who puts LV on the stage of Boo's Nightclub for one-night only. He begins as a boozy and lovable rouge - manipulative and not without charm. But he's ultimately self-serving and unpleasant. At the end of the movie he's on stage giving a drunken, foul-mouthed and aggressive rendering of the Roy Orbison song 'It's Over' (a song about his showbiz career) whilst his creditors wait in the wings.In the end, LV speaks, is saved from a house fire by a BT engineer (a charming Ewan McGregor) and finds a life outside of vinyl and her mother. We even get to know her real name - it's Laura.Everyone in this film is terrific (especially Jom Broadbent as nightclub owner Boo whose acts include the sumo-like tribute band Take Fat). But the film belongs to Caine, in a Golden-Globe winning performance that I think is a career-best. Just watch the scene where he gently coaxes LV into performing live on stage -he even takes us in.

Basically LV Little Voice (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jane Horrocks) is pathetically shy and lives in seclusion listening to her late father's old records, this obviously drives her abusive, loud-mouthed mother Mari Hoff (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Brenda Blethyn) to distraction. At night however when her father's ghost (Graham Turner) visits, LV sings the songs of the great divas such as Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Dame Shirley Bassey. Mari has a new boyfriend with loathsome dead-end talent scout Ray Say (Sir Michael Caine), and one night he overhears LV's innate talent and sees a big chance for making money. He gets local run-down seedy night club owner Mr. Boo (Jim Broadbent) to hear it to, Say gambles everything and forces LV to appear on stage at the club. As they prepare the event, LV and equally shy pigeon racer and telephone engineer Bill (Ewan McGregor) form a tentative, gentle friendship. LV did have a little bit of a bad start when she could only sing in the dark, but the second night she really goes for it, knowing that she can see her Dad in the audience. At the end of the performance though, Ray, Boo and Mari are all celebrating, but LV has gone back to seclusion and solace, and on the night when big talent agent Bunny 'Starmaker' Morris (Taggart's Alex Norton) will be in the audience. Say loses his rag and tries to drag LV to the performance, to be taunted by her many impressions, and when he survives falling down the stairs, he knows his career's gone, and he expresses this on stage with a fantastic performance of Roy Orbison's It's Over, with some dialogue about his situation thrown in. In the end, after surviving a house fire, LV reveals her real name (Laura) and confronts her Mum Mari about the death of her Dad, and it ends with her helping Billy at the pigeon huts exercising them. Also starring Philip Jackson as George and Annette Badland as Sadie. The play was especially written for Horrocks, so no wonder she is fantastic at being shy, singing as the stars and impressions, Blethyn is also great, and Caine sort of steals the show, a great film.

So recently, free of hype I sat down to watch this and, you know what, the hype was mostly true in this case.  It is a flawed but touching and very funny film.The plot is simple but it's the characters that really make it work.  You care about them &#150; you feel for LV, trapped by a loud mother, feel for the silent and thoughtful Billy in a world of brash loud men and feel sorry for the small time, desperate Ray.  The actors all really help.  Horrocks is good and is amazing with the voices but occasionally her nasal whine gets a little too much.  McGregor is better as he is shy and awkward and totally convincing.  Watching him give this performance made me realise just how wooden his Star Wars roles have been.  Caine steals the film easily &#150; his is a wonderful role of a man whose life is going nowhere and is desperately clinging to the one hope he has left.  Caine gets better and better as his character becomes increasingly unravelled.   Blethlyn working class mother is funny but is really quite a lazy working class caricature considering the rest of the cast and the similar roles that she has played better in other films.  Broadbent is good and quite amusing when viewed against some of his more recent characters.Overall this film is a small and quiet like LV herself.  It isn't the most amazing film in the world, but the characters draw you into their world and make you care.

We get more and more background information on LV as the movie teases out her character, and I was surprised to find that Horrocks did all her own singing. And so did Michael Caine in one of the most moving performances of It's Over that I've seen and heard (ably summarized at the end by Broadbent's character, Mr. Boo).I thought the ending was predictable and trite, but I enjoyed the ride a great deal. I can't figure out why I never heard of this movie when it came out. I have to say I thought Caine's It's Over topped all Horrocks's performances, and he deserved his nomination for an Oscar (as did Blethyn). Overall, the movie is a comedy, but it takes a turn at the end when LV stops being Little Voice and confronts her mother.If you liked Blethyn here, you'll like her in Secrets and Lies, another British comedy but with all the comedic twists and turns of life that are missing in Little Voice.

That would not be so bad, but she talks in a very annoying manner; quite the opposite of Little Voice's. All that annoying talking is enough to drive many away, before we hear the first word spoken by Little Voice. The movie does eventually progress beyond that after about a half hour.

The tone of the movie definitely changes during the last third as Michael Caine's character is less kind and more severe, which takes some of the lustre off the story. However, for anyone that generally likes British movies, like Secrets and Lies, Brassed Off, The Full Monty, or Trainspotting,  Little Voice is also a worthwhile 100 minutes. The DVD sound is nothing remarkable, and the image transfer from film is marginal, with lots of blemishes that show up. Still, a very sweet story about a crude and overpowering mother and her shy daughter, LV, with the little speaking voice but the big singing voice.some SPOILERS, for my own recollection. When Caine finally gets LV to sing for a big paying audience, playing up her dead dad and how proud he would be, she said, OK, but only one time. Caine said, Uh, alright, whatever. But he really expected her to follow up her smashing performance with more and more, but she wouldn't. She saw her dad during that first performance, and when his image faded out, she quit singing. She had no interest in performing for others. One performance was all they got, and the big talent agent who came on the second night went away disappointed. And, at the very end, she explained her small voice to her mum, in a very BIG voice, You never let me get a word in, that's why. And, we presume both will be changed forever by the experience.

But it is an even bigger plus that two brilliant old stars in acting were cast beside Horrocks. Michael Caine won a Golden Globe, and Brenda Blethyn was nominated for the Academy Award. This means that `Little Voice' is not just a movie filmed to make a talented person a star but to tell a whole story, in which this person is only one of a few important characters. The makers of Little Voice do NOT act for the same low motives as the promoters of Little Voice in the film. A surprise.Another surprise from the view of some one who is prone to prejudices against music films (like me), the film does not portray LV's life or career over many many years; it is not the typical `rise and fall'-movie (as the title of the original stage play suggests). On the contrary, the plot covers only about a few weeks in the characters' lives. This fact helps it to seem quite unpretentious.Only the ending disappointed me a little. Obviously, the unpretentiousness of the movie caused problems to find an appropriate and satisfying ending. The ending they took is neither appropriate nor satisfying.But apart from that, Little Voice has a lot to offer fine actors, loud and silent ones, intelligent camera motions and the catchy songs of Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland and Shirley Bassey.

The female lead is for my taste just too flat and sweet (Herman has a much better knack dealing with his male leads, Michael Caine is just as great as Pete Postlethwaite was in Brassed Off), the working - class scenario is too romanticized and somewhat patronizing (Tapas bars, Dim Sum restaurants and Starbucks do exist in England nowadays, you know (not that that's a good thing, but they exist)), the nice people are a bit too likeable and the villains are too villainous -- and this time Herman blundered seriously, because Blenda Blethyn plays the evil mother with so much frailty that I liked her loads more than her conceited daughter.  Blenda's just such a star, she could make Adolf Hitler likeable if she'd take on the role and stick on a mustache.  And Ewan McGregor playing the likable lad AGAIN, god spare me!  Overall Herman just always seems bent on turning everything and -one into a cliché, and I don't really understand why.Another slight problem has to do with LV originally being a musical -- live on stage Jane Horrocks was probably very impressive, on celluloid her talent just doesn't come across so well.Anyway, a good imperfect movie, the reason why I have ranted on for so long about its weaknesses is because I am a bad person who likes to tear down other people's efforts.

So when I realised this wasn't a musical, had Jane Horrocks, Michael Cane and Jim Broadbent in it, I thought it couldn't be all bad. The film seems to have been accepted as a real peach. Sadly it's not, but instead more of a curates egg - good in parts. The singing is good - but not exceptional enough to carry the film on it's own. Michael Cane puts in a very classy performance, and Jane Horrocks certainly does a job with the lines she was given. Jim Broadbent has a marginal, but significant role. Ewan McGregor, does OK with his 5 minutes but his character's involvement after the first 10 minutes seems to be a bit of an afterthought. Annette Badland, is a really excellent actress with a wide range(Archers and Dr Who fans will know this), and was wasted on this part, though she plays it well. Brenda Blethyn must have been told play an actress who is hamming up a performance as a busty irritating Hilda Ogden on speed. If so, she did a very good job. Somehow it just felt as if they had rehearsed their roles separately, and the director has then taken the first cut on every shoot to get it over with as quickly as possible. Even though I wasn't expecting much from this, it feels like this film could have been so much better than it turned out to be.

The performance might have worked on stage where on has some aesthetic distance but that's doubtful.  The mother is surely a monster but even a monster requires some subtle shadings, some layers, a bit of nuance.  Blethyn delivers one long slap in the face with a rubber chicken.  It is possible that there is a good movie buried somewhere in this dreck but this crowd didn't find it.

An over the top caricature of a tarnished, would-be 'good time girl'. The good in the film added up to maybe around 20 minutes including the kitchen scene (Caine/Horrocks) and the performance on stage.I was embarrassed by the final hideous tirade by Michael Caine. It was beyond belief, no credibility at all.No club owner that awful could have kept a club going. Far from being portrayed a loser, the effect was embarrassment.I don't know what went wrong, there was a great story in there. If the director had avoided the cliches of foul language and concentrated on classy dialogue to tell a story it could have been so much better!Oscars, Golden Globes.... no way.

I did not receive what I felt was put forward by the film's promotional campaign, and therefore my entire experience of the film was badly tainted.The acting in the film is excellent, and as many have mentioned, the vocal talents of the lead are amazing. I simply think that that talent should have been given more screen time. That does not mean I think that it should have been turned into a Hollywood-ised positive falsehood, simply that more time should have been given to what the movie was promoted as. As for the ending, I have no problem with unconventional endings - I usually enjoy them a great deal more than typical ones. I always enjoy endings that are not what I expected. What disappointed me so greatly about this one is that it didn't appear to go anywhere..I saw no joy or change in Laura's life, no deeper appreciation of herself (which I would have enjoyed far more than a 'success' story in the first place), nothing. I'm all for not tying up all the loose ends - it keeps up the suspense, but introducing and ending that does not address, in my opinion, and of the issues of self-awareness and personal independence put forward in the film is lacking in something.Perhaps if/when I return to see the movie again (as I said my first viewing was tainted) I may see what everyone else is seeing. For now, it remains a disappointment. And,though I do this seldom, I feel the need to respond to one specific commentSurely it isn't implied that a 'good' movie dealing with someone dancing around the edges of the entertainment business only happens when the protagonist 'makes it' in the industry? presumably with attendant drug usage, alcohol abuse, sexual libertinage et cetera? even better of course if we are permitted the Schadenfreude arising from his subsequent collapse into whichever variety of nastiness is currently most titillating. Heaven forbid that such a person may realize that there are more important and rewarding pursuits in life!No. A good entertainment movie deals with the trials tribulations and hard work involved in getting into and staying in the entertainment industry. Whether they make it or not. I said more screen time, not success. This the movie handled well - but failed to note the balance between the pain and the enjoyment that comes with working in the arts. In reference to your comment about drug use etc...that is a stereotype that most artists do not fit and go to lengths to avoid. Yes, the industry can destroy you, and for many it has. But making it a 'presumption' that anyone involved in the arts is a druggie and an alcoholic is an insult to those of us who work in the field and take our profession seriously.The entertainment industry is and important and fulling pursuit and it is a tough one, and this movie does do a fine job of showing the tough aspect of it. I simply think that certain aspects of it could have been handled better or emphasised more.

I'm here to tell you it just ain't so. Horrocks is a talented actress and a really gifted comedienne, but a mediocre singer and a very hit-or-miss impressionist (only her very funny Marlene Dietrich impressed me) and the role of LV is too under-written for the actress to work up to a good head of steam.  Jim Broadbent seems to think he's in a David Lynch film; Brenda Blethyn, jiggling aggressively in various states of undress, is lucky Oscars can't be revoked retroactively; and Michael Caine ... sings!  The slight and obvious story hasn't been filled in with any original insights, the required dark fairy tale tone is rarely achieved, and there are at least two endings too many.  The unfamiliar Scarborough location is the movie's most entertaining element.

The premise is, of course, the stuff of show business fables -- the shy but talented person who blooms in the spotlight, using her talent to transform herself and express herself in ways that she can't otherwise. However, this movie refuses to go the fable route -- with, I think, less than satisfying results.I appreciate that the makers of this film have avoided the clichés of the genre. What I can't appreciate is what they've put in place of those clichés. Little Voice turns out to be a surprisingly sour film, one in which the main character, who's called Little Voice (LV for short), learns to express herself in spite of, and not because of, her talent.LV's attitude toward her gift is, and remains, totally passive; when she sings, she does so only for her dead father. A side plot involving a shy young man who keeps pigeons as pets and who befriends Little Voice holds out the promise that she'll find someone else to sing for, but the movie refuses to follow through. (Did the moviemakers think that would be too corny, too false?)The movie strives for a realistically upbeat ending; I don't think it's the one we want. It makes a hash of what has gone before, telling us that talent isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Why impress us with a glimpse of that talent, only to end up saying, in so many words, that it doesn't matter?Jane Horrocks (who, we're told, did all of her own singing) is smashing as Little Voice (she's so good, she almost gets away with a bizarre scene in which LV, facing a crisis, begins reciting lines from the close of a famous movie); Michael Caine is delightful -- until his last couple of scenes -- as the low-rent showbiz agent determined to bring Little Voice to the world. Brenda Blethyn is over the top as LV's overbearing mother; the character is written and played with all of the subtlety of a bazooka.(P.S. Yes, I knew that was Shirley Bassey singing the Goldfinger theme on the soundtrack.)

The wonderful Jim Broadbent is on hand as the owner of th seedy cabaret where LV is to perform. LV has other ideas. All comes to a terrible end -- at least it does for Caine, Blethyn and Broadbent. Ewen McGregor is on hand as LV's aspiring beau. While there are some very funny moments, this is a dark, dark drama, and being a British film, it does not end up playing out like ROCKY, which the plot of LITTLE VOICE strongly resembles. LV may be an underdog, but she isn't interested in becoming what Blethyn and company want her to. The ending is romantic in its own way, but odd. And decidedly off. But then, this is not a Hollywood movie with a typical Hollywood ending. LITTLE VOICE is really a dressed-up art-house flick that is not going to satisfy mainstream American audiences. Horrocks, a great singer, does get to belt out several classic tunes about two-thirds of the way through, but it's not nearly enough.

Having liked here the few times I've seen ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS and in LIFE IS SWEET, I still was unprepared for her performance here.  She's an extraordinary mimic, and she makes believable the rest of her character.  But the rest of the film is way out of control.  I can respect the seeming decision of writer-director Mark Herman to avoid a tearjerker approach, but the result is loud and boorish, particularly when Brenda Blethyn(who deserves better) is on screen. Every character here is no more than a caricature, and the film shoves that into your face instead of letting it develop naturally.  The only exception, besides Horrocks, is Michael Caine's character, at least part of the time. True, it's a stock character, but Caine makes him likeable in a ramshackle way, until he too falls victim to the boorishness of the film.  If there's a soundtrack to the film featuring Horrocks' imitations, buy it instead.
