In the early 1980's, a series of low budget 'slasher' movies emerged in the wake of HALLOWEEN (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980), most of which were condemned as substandard imitators by critics and horror fans alike. The same thing happened in 1996, following the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM, a smug reworking of genre clich√©s which allowed 'sophisticated' multiplex audiences to indulge an attitude of superiority over those 'crappy' old horror flicks and the 'unsophisticated' viewers who once supported them. The subsequent wave of teenage horror pics were flashy, sexy and ramped to the max, and - true to form - virtually all of them were (ho hum) trashed by critics and horror fans alike. And yet, most of them made a profit, perhaps BECAUSE they were flashier and sexier than those earlier pictures, and because they were designed for a wider demographic than 'mere' horror fans.Jamie Blanks' URBAN LEGEND is a case in point Most reviews ran the gamut from harsh dismissal to faint praise, yet the movie is a visual treat, as creepy and atmospheric as any of the films which inspired it. Furthermore, Silvio Horta's unassuming screenplay confounds expectations with its solid narrative arc, recognizable characters and dynamic set-pieces, not to mention a climactic 'reveal' which offers a robust motive for the killer's devastating onslaught. There are a few embarrassing lapses along the way (such as the murder which takes place in full view of heroine Alicia Witt, which she ignores because she thinks it's a couple having sex!), and Horta can't resist a handful of cop-out contrivances (eg. the killer slashes the wrists of a girl known for her depressive tendencies, causing authorities to dismiss her death as suicide, though a routine forensic examination would have revealed the cuts were administered post mortem, AFTER she was strangled to death!), but these occasional blunders are redeemed by the movie's fast-paced editing, neo-Gothic visual scheme and clever plot developments. Blanks orchestrates proceedings with consummate skill, but he refuses to indulge the kind of transgressive gore that once distinguished this downmarket subgenre (where's Tom Savini when you really need him?!).As expected, the talented young cast - including Jared Leto, Rebecca Gayheart and Tara Reid - is pleasingly photogenic, and there are lengthy appearances by TV favorites Michael Rosenbaum (Smallville) and Joshua Jackson (watch out for the terrific Dawson's Creek gag!). Major co-stars include Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger himself!), John Neville and an uncredited Brad Dourif, who features heavily in a powerful opening sequence where Blanks and Horta pull a major switcheroo on the audience (I'll say no more). Loretta Devine is amusing as the campus security guard who views herself as a modern-day Coffy/Pam Grier (her fantasy is rudely curtailed by a climactic encounter with the rampaging maniac), and there's a brief appearance by Danielle Harris, the former child star of HALLOWEEN 4 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS (1988) and HALLOWEEN 5 (1989), playing an adult character FAR removed from the angelic poppet of those earlier pictures! Beautiful, fairy-tale score by Christopher Young. Followed by the largely unrelated URBAN LEGENDS FINAL CUT (2000).

The murderer-at-large-on-a-college-campus formula was quite popular during the original period of slasher movies in the early '80s (movies like Pieces and Happy Birthday To Me spring to mind). This update is more polished, more logical and generally more watchable.Violent murders begin to take place a college in North America. Many of the murders are based on urban legends (popular spook-stories bandied about by word-of-mouth). First to go is a young girl driving her car through a rainswept night. An axeman leaps up from the back seat and chops her to pieces, in a terrific opening sequence which will have you checking the back seat of your car for the next month or two. From then on, it's generally a downhill ride as more and more of the college staff and students are picked off by a hooded killer. A kid goes for a pee in the woods and is hanged for his trouble; a teenged DJ is hacked apart in her studio; the college principle is run down by a car; the resident wise-ass has an unhealthy variety of toxic products poured down his throat. You get the idea, I'm sure.Many films of this type are awful Where Urban Legend remains tolerable lies in its all-round competence. The scary moments are quite well filmed and are genuinely nerve-jangling at times. The mystery, though contrived, manages to keep you guessing as the finger of suspicion falls upon virtually every character at some point. I must admit that the killer's identity is so well disguised that it caught me out (even though I usually figure out whodunnit in films of this type). Urban Legend is no classic, nor is it particularly fresh, but it does what it does decently enough. It certainly beats the hell out of the excrutiating low-budget exploitation items from the early '80s upon which it is based.

Let's face it, after the mega success of Scream which opened the doors once again after Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street, we needed a new classic. So naturally all the screen writers who were a bit scared to present their ideas on the table, thanks to Kevin Williamson, the clever writer of Scream and Dawson's Creek. After that, every teen slasher film was released the Scream sequels, I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, etc. But we didn't stop at that, we were now presented with Urban Legend.The film begins on a dark and stormy night as college student Michelle Mancini realizes she is near empty while driving in her car. There's someone in the back seat as Michelle drives, a figure in a dark coat with a fur trim around the hood sits up in the back seat and, with a swift blow from its axe, decapitates Michelle. The same night, on campus, a group of friends listens to Parker Riley tell an old story about one of the campus halls, Stanley Hall. According to the story, in 1973, an abnormal psychology teacher went crazy and killed all the students living in an on-campus residence hall. Paul, a school paper journalist thinks the story is bogus. Still, the story sticks in their minds, especially for Natalie, and Brenda. The next day, the front page of the campus newspaper has an article about Michelle Mancini's murder written by Paul but the papers are quickly confiscated by school officials. Later that night after going into a secluded area of woods to talk, Natalie reveals to Damon that she knew Michelle, but they hadn't spoken in years. Damon, playing on Natalie's vulnerability, tries to make a move on her but she rejects him. Upset, Damon goes into the woods to urinate but is attacked by the killer. He then is hung from a tree in a noose with the rope attached to the bumper of his car. The next day, no one believes Natalie's story due to Damon's penchant for pranks and tricks. Realizing both Damon's death and Michelle's murder closely resemble famous urban legends, Natalie goes to the library to read up on urban legends. Not realizing the terror has just begun to scare her and her friends even more.Basically, Urban Legend didn't stand out against it's competitors, it has every clich√© in the book. Not to mention no memorable actors that had the same chemistry as the cast of Scream. It's over written at times and has every predictable moment the friends don't believe in a ghost story, a couple people get killed off but everyone thinks it's a prank/fake death, a classic chase scene with a big breasted girl in a skimpy costume, the creepy janitor, the smart girl that no one believes is all of a sudden right about all the murders and of course a mega twist ending that no one will ever see coming! OK, Urban Legend isn't a horrible movie, while it has all these predictable moments and clich√©s, it's still actually fun to watch and a good part of the memory of good teen slasher films that came out of the 1990's.6/10 "},{"Title":"I really like it","Date":"7 January 2010","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Slashers are never good.

The mysterious killer targets a certain group of friends who initially do not realize, or even ignore, the upcoming danger and fall prey to   his clutches. They leave their rooms unlocked or go alone in the forest at night. The killer's main victim seems to be Natalie (Alicia Witt) a very typical gal, at least on the surface. The killer stalks her and harasses her continuously and Natalie not only tries to convince everyone about the danger in vain, but has to deal with melanic issues from her past. People soon start dropping like flies and Natalie and her friends are helpless before they all meet their fate. Many years before the incidents the college was rumored to have been plagued by an insane professor who flipped and invaded the students' dormitory killing many fraternity members at one single night. One of the few survivors is proven to be a sociopath weird janitor who is not willing to share his traumatic memories in order to help solving the mystery of this new killing spree. The murderer is much more than a freaked loser copycat who simply wants to rekindle the horror on the 25th anniversary of the alleged massacre, but has an obscure agenda.Maybe all these plot elements sound stereotyped and nothing special. The premise of a horror movie localized in a college is as old as it gets and has been done to death (no pun intended). Nevertheless there is a special originality in this film. The killer's modus operandi follows a unique pattern of an urban legend methodology. You probably all know what an urban legend is. Folklore stories which are always laying on the verge of reality and myth. Usually they are scary crimes and everyone seems to know or have heard or have read a similar crime although no one seems to have actually enlisted specific names. Stories like these are usually typical frightening tales. One example is the poisoned candy children are frequently treated on Halloween by insane people. Another example is the seemingly normal father who mysteriously brutally slaughtered his entire family over one night, preferably by axe, and disappeared never to be heard of again. The screenwriter plays cleverly with all the cliches and the fears of the dark. The urban legends provide fertile ground for some genuinely original and shocking death scenes. Urban Legend, despite an intriguing premise, cannot hide its  origin. It is a typical 90's horror film mixed with a whodunit subplot, recognizable TV faces and plenty of gore. The film succeeds in being a memorable and above average effort but if you are set to watch it you are bound to find all the stupid overused themes a teeny bopper provides (without nudity though that is the determinant between 80's and 90's). There are plot holes the size of a volcano crater. For example the police officers are so dim witted that they regard a clearly obvious strangulation which would probably have left distinct bruises on the victim's neck as a suicide. Moreover why, oh why don't they send officers during the climactic tragic events after all those murders. I can accept the fact that the phone lines were dead but couldn't someone just go and ask for help? When they do arrive it is far too late. The cast was also over-crowded and it was obvious that the protagonists were nothing more than screen fillers. It is too bad since their acting skills, which seemed promising, were withheld. For example Jared Leto and Michael Rosenbaum are Paul and Parker respectively. Although the film starts off interestingly with equal screen time, Natalie soon wins the absolute focus and their roles are so small that they end up being extras. Things are even worse for Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) and Sasha (Tara Reid) who also had shrunken roles and are wandering pretty faces waiting in line to be sliced and diced. Although the suspects are many, the final revelation of the killer is weak, the motives even weaker and of course we have the inevitable cat-lived nature of the killer-who-refuses-to-die escorted by the predictable cliffhanger epilogue with the TO BE SEQUELED sign.An extra detrimental element is the presence of Alicia Witt in an especially important role. Her acting is not awful but it is definitely misguided and fails. Witt is way too calm to convince as a realistic character. After a certain point it is clear that her psychopath stalker has not only killed her friends, but is after her, and she doesn't even show a trace of panic. She DOES try of course to warn the bonehead authorities and she does a little research on the urban legends. The bad thing is that even in the gruesome finale she doesn't seem to fear the maniac even a little bit and even worse she is not the willing-to-fight heroine that Sidney Prescott in Scream was. Now I don't want to be misunderstood, I wasn't looking for Jamie Lee Curtis's overblown vocal pipes but she could have more human reactions, especially after the deaths of her friends. It's as though Natalie had read the victim list and knew that she had a contractual commitment to survive until the end. The only one of the main characters with some substance is Joshua Jackson as Damon. This guy is a derivative from other horror films and strikes as a cardboard cutout a prankster who teases his friends and is slightly horny. At least Damon has a certain and sensible persona and Jackson is adequate. The funniest aspect of the film is that the cameos are far more successful and memorable than the leads!! Danielle Harris in a short role is the quite trendy Gothic young diva who is the incarnation of the Lust sin, the aged John Neville is the strict and by the rules Dean of the University and Brad Dourif gives an excellent performance in a role which I won't reveal. The best of them is Robert Englund as the clever and a bit creepy Professor who teaches folklore and introduces his students to the urban legends. Professor Wexler seems to be the chief suspect for this horrific situation and although there are sporadic hints throughout the film which point to other directions, Englund virtually dominates the screen even with his absence!!! Of course I won't omit Loretta Devine as Reese the guardian of the University who is very funny and adds the necessary comic relief. Who could have thought? A woman and indeed a black one as the cop/protector. It is another attempt to break a few cliches. Well done casting directors.Apart from some good performances Urban Legend has many other assets. The opening sequence alone was enough to keep me hooked on as I realized I would watch a great film. The rainy frames and the professional shooting with the distant take angles is enough to pose the threatening tone and warn us about what is to follow. The introductory scene is a stand alone masterpiece. The killer here doesn't have a costume but hides under a winter jacket with a cowl and this gives a realistic touch and a difficulty in pinpointing the culprit since many people have the same type of jacket. The best part of Urban Legend is the setting and the cinematography. The university buildings are bulky and old enough to support a medieval atmosphere which excites our imagination. Further, these baroque aged buildings give a much more scary climate and ensure that no matter how much they run, the protagonists will never get away since the corridors are so long that probably no one is going to hear them scream. But the greatest virtue is the photography which was dreary and gave a sense of a documentary style. The best example to describe the stigma the director tried to pull off are the library scenes. The leads are in a situation reminiscent of the Name of the Rose (lacking the religious undertones of course!!!) and are trapped in an infernal game they cannot escape. The whole point of view of the movie is clearly cinematic and the imaging techniques are much supportive. As I aforementioned the death scenes are fascinating and catapult the adrenaline to heights. Although the character development is bare you feel sorry for the victims (well, OK, for most of them). One surprise follows another as the body count increases. It comes as a great disappointment therefore that after a chilling 90 minutes period, the last 30 minutes go downhill. The action is very weak, the suspense retreats and we are left with overacting, inept and predictable plot twists, inadequate explanations and a rather disappointing climax . I mean how could anyone not wonder why the maniac wouldn't just kill Natalie and get over with this revenging mission instead of doing this wild carnage. So be warned the last half hour is extremely disappointing. Thus, if you are a horror fan who wants an entertaining thriller Urban Legend is a good shot. Despite some letdowns Urban Legend is yet another landmark in 90's horror genre.

It's also highly entertaining from beginning to end and rattles along at such a pace that you can easily overlook it's many flaws for the duration.At its very core you probably won't be at all surprised to know that Urban Legend is all about a killer killing people a la various urban legends. And that's the hook (pardon the pun) that makes the movie so much fun. It doesn't really matter how ridiculous the killer's motives are or how uncanny he/she seems to be at avoiding being caught, waiting to see the next attempted kill is always entertaining.The bright, young cast are all very watchable people doing a good job with the material. Alicia Witt, Jared Leto, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Michael Rosenbaum, Danielle Harris, Tara Reid, etc were all good names to use in the advertising of the movie at the time despite the mixed fortunes that the future would bring. With small, but decent, roles for Brad Dourif and Robert Englund this should appeal to fans of the genre. It's only really Loretta Devine's character that doesn't work but that's no fault of the actress, who acts gamely with what she's given and wrings some entertainment value from it.The script, by Silvio Horta, is decent. A lot of the urban legends are referenced before appearing as death scenes or discussed afterwards, in light of the cause of death, and the characterisations are all fairly decent, if also a bit stereotypical at times (with the main offender being Tosh, the sullen goth character played by Danielle Harris).Jamie Blanks does well in the director's chair (this was his feature debut, actually). The man has talent. I am one of the few who also enjoyed Valentine and I encourage all horror fans to check out Storm Warning, his little-known 2007 flick.From an exciting opening sequence, that really puts a well-known urban legend up there in all it's clich√©d glory, to a fast-paced and potentially grisly finale, Urban Legend races from set-piece to set-piece and keeps you so entertained that it's only after the credits roll that you start to pick apart every thread of it's frayed logic. It's got a fun, if predictable, punchline too. Great fun.

Signposting some of the urban legends would have been helpful (there's a urban legend about a DJ being killed on the air and people thinking it was a hoax???).  The cast is likable enough, but only Loretta Devine really stands out.  The movie could as easily have been called Horror Movie Cliche as Urban Legend (or was that subtitle spoken for by Scream?).  There are a few cute in-jokes (yes, one of the actresses was in a Noxema commercial).  It's generally an entertaining way to waste a couple of hours if you're a horror-slasher fan.

What little suspense there is comes from the anticipation of these scenes, since the surrounding story is almost as ridiculous as the film itself.If the screenwriters had concentrated less on incorporating the whodunit aspect into the plot and more on the legends themselves, they might have had something here. Experienced viewers will spot the killer's identity (and motive) early on, and those that don't will be fooled only because the conclusion is so completely ludicrous, not to mention mostly impossible.Of course, most of this would be easily overlooked if Urban Legend was scary, but time and again, director Jamie Banks telegraphs the surprises far ahead, and doesn't know how to time the shocks.  Over and over we get the sudden burst of loud music followed by a character running into another character, but it doesn't work. And that gets annoying after the third or fourth try. Occasionally Banks does get something eerie going, but the style is more suited to an action flick.Of the cast, most of the actors more or less get by despite a less-than-clever script, though it's disheartening to see a talented young actor like Jared Leto wasting his time with a nothing role as the reporter. Horror favorites Robert Englund and Brad Douriff pop up in cameos, adding a nice touch to their brief scenes.What we're left with is an intriguing idea undone by cliche after cliche. The legends are potent enough to hold your attention to the end, and horror fans will find a few gruesome goodies to amuse themselves. And even though the script needs to be about three times again as clever as it is, there is a great in-joke at the end about one of the actresses and a commercial.That clever scene might have been the first scene of a clever movie.  It's the last scene of this one.

Alicia Witt makes a fine heroine and director Jamie Blanks sure knows how to set the mood for edge of your seat creeps. He does far better here than in Valentine. He makes good use of rain storms. I think it rained throughout half of the movie, which is a good thing. My favorite scene in the whole movie is where the killer is chasing Tara Reid, who was in the middle of hosting her college radio show. There are plenty of other scenes like this one that remind me of 80's slasher flicks, not Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer. This one is more along the lines of Halloween and Friday the 13th. Note if you are the type of person who likes thinking movies, you will probably laugh at several of the going-ons in this film. The ending is hilarious, and for once I think it was intentional. I can even picture the director laughing while directing it and the writer laughing while writing. I was certainly laughing while watching it.

What I really hate is people comparing this movie to scream. Does this movie feature references to other movies? No. Does this movie have the killer killing people in the same boring way over and over? No. And finally, does this movie feel like a 90's teen horror movie. NO! The death scenes make it feel like it's a movie from the 80's. There are some great scenes in here like SPOILER! SPOILER! Sasha's death scene, the pop rocks scene, and it had the great killer in the backseat opening murder. END OF SPOILER. People think that just because it came out after Scream it's a copycat. Well Friday the 13th came out after Halloween and that was considered a copycat. But what about all of the horror movies that came out in the early 70's before Halloween. There were slashers.

That'll put bums in seats! Equally inevitably, he was right and Urban Legend remains one of the most successful slasher films of all time. Director Jamie Blanks, who would later go for a more old school approach with another slasher film Valentine, takes a dot every I, cross every T approach here, signing on horror alumni Robert Englund, Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris for minor roles, opting for MTV casting with the bigger roles with Tara Reid, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart (before her self imposed exile from the mainstream following a DUI fatality), Jared Leto and Joshua Jackson all signing on, and borrowing from the success of Scream with a script offering frequent winks to the audience along the way.The overall effect of Urban Legend is a rather silly, only occasionally grisly, trip through late 90s pop culture with some passable performances, a workman like script and some shrewd casting.Love it or hate it, the film follows a winning formula and it's not very hard to see why it trails only the Scream movies as the highest grossing slasher film ever. I found it to be inoffensive fun when it first came out and more than a decade later, nothing's changed.

Unfortunately, said premise is completely wasted on an otherwise ludicrous movie.In fact, after the first death scene, whose setup was so far-fetched that it makes elements of the Child's Play series seem almost plausible, Urban Legend actually CHANGES its entire premise! Instead of focusing on the interesting notion of the setup of these crimes, it digresses into a boring whodunnit whose entire (new) premise is that no less than seven people on the same college campus own THE EXACT SAME HOODED PARKA-- and it's not even an Abercrombie or an Old Navy parka; it's an old, worn-out denim thing that NO college students as visually appealing as those in this film's cast would ever be caught dead wearing.Even more frustrating is the fact that Zoe from Cybill (Alicia Witt) and Jordan Catilano (Jared Leto), Urban Legends central, albeit grossly underdeveloped characters, are unable to figure out who the person in the correct parka is, even though the killer's motives are so blatantly obvious that the 12 year old sitting in front of me in the theater knew who the killer was less than 45 minutes into the movie.Ultimately, Urban Legend is just INSULTING, assuming that its audience is every bit as dull and oblivious as its characters. In terms of horror flicks, it makes Halloween II and Worms appear comparable to The Silence of the Lambs or Psycho.Rating 1 out of 10.

First off, I am not a fan of the slasher movie genre. As RavenGlamDVDCollector, I do go after the pretty girls, though. My gripe with slashers is of course that blood and glamor doesn't mix. Who wants to see a pretty girl cut up? (That is, of course, a stupid question that I do not want to hear the answer to) I'm a big Rebecca Gayheart fan ever since her BEVERLY HILLS 90210 days, she was sorely missed by me when her character was killed off in that series, and so it came to pass that RavenGlam research showed the incredibly hot young cast of URBAN LEGEND. There are two sequels, direct-to-video, that seem entirely less promising, but URBAN LEGEND the original sure has a lot of pretty girls, with Tara Reid thrown in for good measure. Alicia Witt I knew from BODIES, REST & MOTION in a short but vivid sequence, aside from an absolutely vague memory of the kid in 90's sitcom CYBILL It is way beneath me to discuss the bloody scenes in this movie. They are extremely far-fetched, and as it turns out, FINAL SPOILER ALERT, committed by best friend Brenda. However berserk any human might get, and, yes, we all have it in us to kill, but come on! Rebecca Gayheart could execute that big blonde guy by hanging him? The bloody strangulation scene deemed as a 'suicide' is a symptom of a terminally-ill plot. And everybody wears that freaking abysmal style of coat. Even next to an indoor swimming pool when it was clearly shown to be a normal day, nobody else was remotely dressed for winter, and that thing was designed for Eskimos.The potholes in the plot are big enough for two army trucks to disappear into with no survivors.Best thing about the movie, Alicia Witt. Okay, I do agree, she wasn't scared enough, but in some scared scenes, she was just ooh-shame-what-a-beautiful-scared-bunny, let-me-hug-ya! Tara Reid was an absolute disappointment, I am very sorry to say, she could have done a lot better.

The whodunit aspect is also entertaining, there are so many red herrings thrown around in this movie. However, the climax is pretty disappointing. When you find out who the killer is in Scream, you're genuinely surprised it's a movie that's even more fun to watch the second time, because then you can puzzle it all together. The revelation in Urban Legend on the other hand makes no sense whatsoever, and you just feel cheated by the movie.

There is a mad killer on the loose wearing a parka even where it's too hot to wear a parka.

The deaths of professor Wexler (Robert Englund) and Parker (Michael Rosenbaum) are weak and unconvincing. The movie bounces back and forth between some really good set pieces and some clumsy ones. Blanks is going for a classy horror film here but he seems to be unsure if he is pulling it off. There are many times when the audience must throw logic completely out the window or the plot doesn't work at all. The scary looking killer wears a big coat with a hood, yet we see no less than 4 other characters with the exact same coat in their possession. This cheapens the movie and so does the lapses in logic of the script. The overall effectiveness of the film still works with above average suspense and some great kills. These nice moments are mixed in with cheap effects like a friend coming up behind another character and creating a false scare. This is Urban Legend in a nutshell.

Are we really supposed to laugh knowingly at these fossilised scenes because of the movie's desperate attempts to emulate 'Scream'? Yes we are and yes we are, and screw you, movie.The kernel of a good idea is in there somewhere - a serial killer recreates urban legends - but other than that it's a creative dead zone. The clunky dialogue is spouted by a cast culled from small screen teen drivel, and the film is so idiotic that it can't even pull off a competent false scare. For instance, the killer wears a hooded parka - scary! - and in one scene one of the non-characters sees a parka-clad figure enter a swimming pool building, walk purposefully towards a swimmer and stand there menacingly... you could cut the tension with a spoon... but not to worry, it's just someone with a swimsuit under the coat and not the killer after all! Phew! But why in the name of holy hell would someone walk into a pool room on a hot day dressed in a parka?The film is littered with similarly pathetic red herrings and false accusations. Half the characters own a parka with a furry hood to put us off the scent, but the only scent is the reeking BS that permeates the entire movie. The direction is lacklustre and the editing sloppy and apathetic, resulting in a movie so poorly structured that one scene just flops into the next, with no kind of impetus or momentum. That's what really gets me about this film it's incredibly lazy, it doesn't try. The brief flashes of so-called post-modernism are there only because Kevin Williamson gave the writers of these films licence to crib from every one of their predecessors and dress it up as some kind of witty homage.So we have a bland young cast, killings-a-plenty, a few in-jokes (Joshua Jackson turns on the radio, hears the theme tune to 'Dawson's Creek' and switches it off again), an arbitrary unmasking and loads of stupid dialogue that doesn't so much advance the plot as send it plodding round in circles.

In the Horror encyclopedia, Urban Legend wouldn't appear in one of the sub-genre's chapters, but rather in an appendix.The idea is, in my opinion, very original and very well portrayed. A killer who eliminates victims one by one in accordance with the scenery and background story of the famous urban legends we all know and love (and some that I personally have only learnt of through this film). However, Urban Legend is also a stereotypical 90's Horror in many ways... the characters being college students (and actors made famous by a then successful TV drama), the location being college/dorm/student apartment, the killer being a character we've already seen, even the little wink at parody (in this case - the radio playing Dawson's Creak theme when Joshua Jackson starts his car). Also, no gore but plenty of blood in the right places. All not unlike the two famous Horror brands of the time, Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.All in all, Urban Legends is a great film using a great idea. However, while not being able to point a finger to it, it feels like it lacks something. Perhaps a smarter twist in the end, or a more realistic ending. Perhaps the fact that the idea of using urban legends as inspiration has been the best part of the film, while the rest was not more than average. Perhaps the shortage of true Horror and fear. I'm not sure... Still, I've had a great time watching it, even it isn't the best Horror film in history, or even of its time.

Yeah, the opening sequence is *that* kind of good. But then it all goes pretty much as downhill as it can get from there on....It's sad to say that Brad Dourif may be the highlight of this feature, given that he is only included in one scene, but whatever. The rest of our cast is the typical montage of up-and-coming late teens/early twenties stars. Jared Leto would of course go on to make great things with 'Requiem For A Dream' two years later, Joshua Jackson has been in a handful of good movies and is recognizable, which is probably a good thing since he is probably the most recognizable face in the whole movie to me. However, Loretta Devine really steals the show here. Forget Rebecca Gayheart and the trying year she had with making not only 'Urban Legend' but appearing in 'Scream 2' also. The ending few minutes are predictable to say the least. But like I said, Loretta Devine makes the whole crap scenario tolerable. The entire movie pays more than enough homage to 'Scream' and gives us an extremely generous helping of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' worship. But, sadly for 'Urban Legend', we've all seen both of those two movies, and Kevin Williamson did it a lot better. The end sequence features one scene that throws 'Halloween' homages in your face, but it just doesn't work like how it did for John Carpenter.See 'Urban Legend' because it has a lot to say. However, it feels more essential than it actually is.URBAN LEGEND -----6/10.

It opens with a bravura sequence, sets up an intriguing premise and broadly stays true to that premise right through to the end. It's well written with a talented, good-looking cast and looks terrific. It walks the line between old-fashioned slasher flick and the post-modern tongue-in-cheek variety adeptly. I watched it when it first came out and enjoyed it. I watched it again, this time on bluray, a few days ago. It's still a much better than average campus horror flick. If it's a little less frightening than some others of the genre, it's a lot smarter than most. It's often compared to I Know What You Did.... Urban Legend is the better film.

But it's a low budget 98 film and the storyline is pretty good, despite being simple.There are plenty of horror films based on Urban Legends, but not many which are about Urban Legends. The killer isn't too obvious and even though I suspected them at one point, I then changed my mind, then went back to them.The only thing I would have liked in this film would to have been told more about the Stanley Halls murders, maybe by the survivor, and for a certain hot girl to not have been killed! She should never be killed in films.It's a good film if you're having a sleep over, or a certain someone round for the night. You can talk about it, say who you think it is, I'm easy to make jump but it made my boyfriend jump too so, it's a good film, especially for what they had to go with. I'd recommend it as a sleepover film or a pass-the-time film that isn't a waste .

However it does insult your intelligence sometimes like in the scene where Tara Reid's character narrowly escapes certain death and then runs into a nearby elevator when she could have just ran out of the front doors to safety. Also, there is a questionable scene in the beginning where a woman gets decapitated while driving a car and the killer miraculously survives and is even unharmed. But those are minor drawbacks which are present in almost every B-movie slasher.Still most of the viewing audience will probably discard this and consider it a trashy Scream rip-off, but for most of us die hard slasher-fans Urban Legend ain't too shabby. It's definitely not better than the Scream trilogy, but it's worthy of a viewing. I rate it 6/10. Avoid the sequel.

This entails some very interesting and very unique deaths that i have not seen before in other horror films. The story is very good and shy's away from the typical idea of teens getting picked off by some killer in a mask, the story leads to much more than that typical affair that has been set by the Scream franchise.Of course with every horror film you have to expect some stereotypes, and in this case it is the characters. The typical sex craving busty blonde's etc also the typical scream fest of the woman being chased down the dark hallways by the crazed killer. Now this can become tedious but thankfully this does not happen a lot in the film as it frequently does with others so your ears are spared.The film opens strongly although not as strong as say the opening to Scream, but this film opens with a kill that sets the tone of what is to come and also we get to see Brad Douriff play a small role with big assets to the film. Also Robert Englund makes an appearance as a creepy Professor who makes a couple of good jump in your seat moments and also Englund gives a unique performance way off from Freddy Kruger which isn't a bad thing really.The rest of the cast are not really memorable in any way, although i did think Jared Leto and Joshua Jackson put in a good performances although i do think Jacksons character was a little under used as he did have a good character.The look of the film is typical for the genre with the darkness and the low key lighting making it just the same as any other horror film you have seen before. The campus was a great setting and created some great opportunities for the atmosphere of the film.The direction is good in places and only very rarely does it seem to let up which is good and the director builds tension with ease but the final scare never really seems to come which is a shame because the tension is well built.Overall the film wont win any awards for being a fantastic horror film because the horror films of today never are as good as the classics and also these films will always be compared to the Scream franchise and films like I Know What You Did Last Summer but this films i think belongs up their with them, although not as good as say Scream this film offers new ideas to what is becoming a tiered genre and i think if you are a horror buff like me, just check it out its worth a look! ****** out of ********** "},{"Title":"urban legend review","Date":"29 October 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" An attractive young woman is driving her car on a dark country road and singing along to the radio. She's running out of petrol and so she pulls into a petrol station (run by a jittery, stuttering Brad Dourif), but then flees what seems to be an attack, only to find the real threat in her backseat a hooded killer with an ax who takes her head off with a well-aimed swing. I'm sure you've heard this story before. Not surprising, given that it's one of the more famous urban legends borrowed for Urban Legend, a post-Scream exercise in self-referential horror. The students at an ivy-covered New England college are turning up dead, the victims of a serial killer who murders in the fashion of the apocryphal modern myths. It's all for the benefit of good girl with a dark secret Alicia Witt, the sole witness to most of the killings. Rebecca Gayheart, her gullible best friend, and Jared Leto, the ambitious campus journalist who tracks down the secret that hangs over the school, lead a cast of pretty young women, good looking guys, and campus characters, notably the suspicious professor Robert Englund, a genre legend in his own right as the star of seven Nightmare on Elm Street films. The film has a direct link to the 1970s' rash of teen slasher movies, where sexually active teens are sliced, diced, and otherwise slaughtered in elaborate and ingenious ways. The increasingly preposterous film is no Scream, but the modestly stylish production has its moments.

Most notably 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and this movie.'Urban Legend' has clone written all over it, as almost everything in the movie has been borrowed from other slasher movies.  Take the plot, for instance, the movie wants to pass itself as being about a killer on campus that crafts murders according to the most known urban legends. But, the thing is that by the end of the movie, we find that the plot is a simple rehash of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. It really has nothing to do with urban legends.  Even the killer's costume reeks of deja-vu. However, despite its recycled plot and thrills, 'Legend' can still keep you distracted for a while.Rating (6/10) "},{"Title":"Blanks' best slasher to date...","Date":"18 February 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Spoiler First things first, there are a couple of things that I have to get off my chest before I begin my review of Jamie Banks' much-maligned slasher/whodunit Urban Legend. The thing that brought my attention to the film in the first place was the fact that it boldly states on the front cover that it's the `.Bloodiest teen slasherfest to come over from the states so far...' I then thought to myself that was one hell of a bold statement to make.  Could it be a film gorier than Nightmares in a damaged brain or Maniac?  Or could it even be a flick bloodier than Blood Rage, The Burning or the uncut Intruder?  If so how did it gain a certificate from the good ol' BBFC? Or could it be that the unnamed reviewer from The Sun who wrote that article was trying out some freshly picked highly hallucinogenic magic mushrooms?  I'm afraid that after watching this I found that the later is probably the closest to the truth because although Urban Legend has its moments, gore is definitely not one of the movie's strong points. As for it being one of the bloodiest of its kind to come over from the states so far, well lets just say that this must've been the first slasher flick that the journalist in question had seen, or he must have accidentally watched the wrong film.who knows? I think I'll change the subject before I pass out!Secondly before watching UL I was biased into thinking it was going to be really rather terrible after the amount of bad publicity it got from its UK release.  Almost every review I read was warning the viewer to avoid it at all costs.  But to anyone, who has got a video library filled with as many, how can I put it, 'matter of taste' flicks as me that is all the invitation I needed.It all opens familiarly on a dark raining night. A female teen (who we later find out is Michelle Mancini) is shown driving along some secluded country lanes and listening to her car radio. She takes her eyes off the road momentarily to insert a tape, and while her concentration is elsewhere she almost crashes into an oncoming vehicle. However after regaining control of her station wagon she manages to comfort herself by 'singing' along to Bonnie Tyler's 'Total eclipse of the heart' which pumps loudly through the speakers.  Now being a man of the world I have been to many a pub karaoke and even on a rare occasion (depending mostly on the strength of my alcohol intake!) I have even had the odd singsong myself, if not over the microphone then at least in the streets on my way home.  Oh yes, many a time of a late night I have been heard singing along to various Presley hits or something similar to that vein! But I can honestly say, never in all my years of visiting dodgy beered up sing alongs have I ever heard anyone with such a lack of vocal talent.  I mean it's terrible. She mumbles the wrong lyrics completely out of time and tune with the music, I'm telling you it is really, really bad. I had only been watching Urban Legend for 2 minutes and was already wishing the killer would hurry up and do us viewers (and probably the girl in question) a big favour and off her sharpish! Anyway, back to the plot and our hapless teen has just realised she has run out of petrol. Luckily she can see a garage in the distance and even luckier still she just manages to roll onto the forecourt.  On arrival the station attendant who stutters when he speaks and looks generally retarded and immediately has you thinking 'this is our psychotic killer' greets her! A fact that is enlightened by the girl looking decidedly disgruntled and muttering 'freak show' to herself.  He begins filling up the car and she passes him her credit card before he disappears into the cabin. Two seconds later he returns telling her the unlikely story that the Card Company is on the phone and they want to speak with her.  Clearly scared she reaches for what looks like a can of CS gas before following the somewhat disfigured worker into the shop.  She gets to the phone and picks it up to speak, but no one is there, she turns around to look at the attendant who is locking the door menacingly behind him. She tries to head for the exit but he grabs at her stuttering and trying to spit out his words.  She manages to spray his face with the gas and he falls to the floor in pain.  She throws the phone she was earlier using through the window, it smashes and she climbs out heading back to her car.  The attendant follows closely still trying to spit out his words.  Michelle manages to get in her wagon and start it up. She doesn't hang around and hurriedly spins away from the forecourt.  Just as she leaves, the garage keeper manages to spit out his words, which he had been trying so hard to speak `Stop.someone's in the back seat!' but his attempts fall on deaf ears.  Michelle tries to comfort herself once again by singing (oh, no!) but suddenly she catches a glimpse of a shadow moving in the back of her wagon, from the corner of her eye. She checks her rear view mirror to see a hooded character holding an axe on the seat.  She screams and at the same time the axe swings. As the hatchet smashes through the glass windows her scream is silenced. Urban Legend's first victim has been dealt with. We are now shown a very dreary looking college campus named Pendleton University and introduced to a few likely suspects or victims Sasha (Tara Reid) The somewhat bubbly radio host, Paul (Jared Leto) The ambitious campus journalist, Damon (Joshua Jackson) A practical joker and remarkable Eminem look-alike! Parker (Michael Rosenbaum) another good time guy, Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) yet another bubbly bimbo and Natalie (Alicia Witt) the stroppy leading lady. They sit round and discuss the recent murder of Michelle Mancini and the legend of the 'Stanley Hall Massacre', where 25 years earlier at that same college a professor was supposedly meant to have gone berserk and offed 'a whole floor' full of students before stabbing himself through the heart with a honey knife. In good old slasher tradition the kids decide to have a party to commemorate the aforementioned massacre, which you know is probably going to be a bad idea! Before long our Urban Legend style butcher puts in a few reappearances and starts working his way through the cast in some pretty imaginative ways. Natalie our over sulky leading lady witnesses most of these murders but of course, no-one else sees them or believes her, especially the somewhat suspicious Dean Adams (John Neville) and the college 'rent-a-cop' as she's so frequently called, Reese (Loretta Devine).  Before long the usual happens and she is left alone to confront the deranged killer.To be honest, and I'm going to be an individual here, I can't for the life of me see what is so bad about Jamie Banks' first attempt at a splatter movie.  Seeing how this was his directorial debut (previously he had worked as a camera operator on action flick The Huntsman) I think he's done a pretty damn good job. I was so puzzled when I had finished watching UL after reading such bad reviews and thoroughly enjoying it that I rang up two of my friends and invited them to come around and watch it with me and my girlfriend.  When it was finished I asked what they thought and all three of them agreed it was a good film, one even went as far as to say it was better than Scream!Each murder gets more and more imaginative than the next, the killer going too various lengths to stage his slaughter. I agree that when the butcher's identity is revealed you are left thinking how did he (or she!) manage to perform those killings unaided, but that is by no means grounds to say that the film is bad. There are loads and loads of good ideas and points that make Urban Legend far above average.  It is also benefited with a haunting score and a good strong cast, which were at the time of release really mostly unknowns.  Jared Leto has since gone onto earn roles in Fight Club and Black and White, not too mention The Thin Red Line and Rebecca Gayheart has also done a fair bit since including a part in From Dusk 'til Dawn 3. Tara Reid's exceptional beauty won me over and I really hoped that she would be the one that survived the massacre. However, Banks is quite ruthless with the cast and not many characters avoid the assassin's blade!Although it's not all that gory, there's at least one unwatchable scene. The assassin attempts a kidney heist on our hapless final girl, cutting her stomach open! Banks also manages a couple of decent jumps and false scares. The flick also gets 'edge of your seat' tense toward the end as you play the director's game of guess the killer's identity as he cleverly nails it down to the last couple of suspects and attempts to keep you guessing!So all said and done I think it just goes to show Urban Legend is a matter of taste movie, you either love it or hate it. I must admit that I actually really liked it and it remains far more entertaining than the miserable Valentine. Don't be dissuaded by the poor publicity that circled this one, its well worth checking out.

The characters are all paper thin and the lead mopes around for an hour and a half, so it gets to the point that you're cheering on the killer to end it all. And by the way, what is with the killer's disguise? A winter coat? Jeesh. That's digging deep. Obviously, since this came out in the wake of the Scream flicks, it's pretty predictable. The whole self-aware slasher formula was pretty played out by the time this movie rolled out. I will give the movie some credit, there are several disturbing deaths (i.e. the poisoning, the parking lot) and some pretty good rock tunes playing in the background (Stabbing Westward, Rob Zombie, Monster Magnet) as well. However, aside from that, the movie is very flimsy. Most people have forgotten about it by now. Rightfully so.

I even got a kick out of the first half of I Know What You Did Last Summer. I think Urban Legend was the first hip slasher that started to feel like enough is enough.Looking back now, the movie doesn't seem all that bad. Especially in comparison to the garbage that followed it (including its name only sequel). Visually it's quite good. The locations are interesting and make the film much richer. I mean, compare the campus in this film to the one in Scream 2. The combination of existing buildings and the way they lit and shot them gets them an A in that department. Director Jamie Blanks seems to be quite the fan of crane shots and he uses them to good effect several times.Populated by WB stars and other young talent, the cast is decent. Givent he material they're working with I think they all do an admirable job. The killer's identity is definetely a surprise but not an all together plausible one. The final I did it because... monologue bounces back and forth from being intense to over the top. The main character is pretty bland. Definetly the most forgettable of the bunch. Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, and Tara Reid all do well in their roles. Michael Rosenbaum comes off a little too much like a poor man's Stu for my tastes. Jared Leto's also pretty unlikeable as the love interest. Great small performances from Robert Englund, Brad Douriff, and that creepy guy that plays the janitor (Boo! LOL!!).I suppose the biggest problem is the script. Which is too bad, because a serial killer basing his murders on urban legends is a fantastic idea. But the story is filled with the typical slasher plot holes and lapses of logic. But even at its worse, Urban Legend is a lot better than the pre-Scream slasher movies. Unfortunately this, for me, was sort of the nail in the coffin as far as the new ones go. It was just a new gimmick used to show us the same scenes we've all seen before.

Urban Legends is just another teen slasher horror movie, that we all feel we've seen before, most noticeably in the Scream trilogy. But this time Urban Legends is one step ahead of the other horror movies, whereas the plot is no way original. It can be resumed in a single sentence. On a US High School, a killer starts slashing teenage students, based on the good old Urban Legends. Needles is to say what comes next big boob girls running away from the killer, the central character, who, by the way happens to be a girl, never gets killed, despite being stalked every now and then, and lots of gore scenes, lots of blood and jump scenes. This is the main essence of an horror movie, it could also be called Scream 4, the only thing you had to do is put Neve Campbell on the lead and a goofy best friend cop, and that was it. Oddly enough, after all these `qualities' that could also be called plagiarism, Urban Legends ends up being a surprisingly good horror movie, with a great Tv Show cast, and a plot full of hilarious lines. Also what is more than expected is that when the movie starts, everyone knows what's going to happen everyone gets killed except for the lead, a big twist in the end to reveal the killer or the killers, and also another twist in the very end that conveniently has to leave room for a sequel. That's probably where Urban Legends gets stronger the killer is the very last character you may expect (although clues where falling down like rain), the twist in the very end is not only surprising and interesting, not mention humanly impossible or improbable. Jamie Blanks decently directed providing chills wherever and whenever they are needed, gets the movie to be worth more for its horror and for its lines rather for it's deja v√∫ feeling. 6 out of 10   "},{"Title":"Fun Fun Fun!","Date":"24 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Urban Legend came at exactly the right time.

An interesting plot seems to promise more Scream-style fun. The film starts off on the right foot with a terrific opener but as soon as it begins to rely on that same sort of ripped-off, pretentious '90s teeny-bopper dialogue pioneered by Kevin Williamson (who himself had adapted from various other hip-talking films, one of which was without a doubt THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE), the viewer can see just how serious the crew is about this film. Not very much.Though it often benefits from it's carefree attitude toward fronting itself as a horror film, and there are some great one-liners, and the leading actresses Witt and especially, Gayheart are excellent, the movie falls short of delivering the goods for horror fans. And the majority of supporting characters serve up this hokey dialogue, so I end up rooting for the killer, who doesn't have much common sence which also makes it hard to appreciate the eventual evolution into an immortal Robo-killer.In conclusion, I like the killer's confession scene. Funny killer. But while the movie is mildly entertaining, it's too hokey and does go overboard a bit on the body count. Hopefully, the sequel will go further in length than this one stayed behind.

Winning @ WhereLegendsRule.cjb.netWhen I sat down to watch Urban Legend, I was ready to watch yet another Halloween imitator, trying to chip in on the success of Scream and make a quick dollar. I had heard many bad reviews from the main-stream critics, so I wasn't expecting much, despite my anticipation... But what I received was an original, scary, witty movie that was far more entertaining than any critics had made out. True, Urban Legend was undoubtedly inspired by Scream, but why should we see that as a bad thing?The use of the urban legends was handled extremely well - the writer picked out the most scary and disturbing of them all - and they were well integrated into story. Writer Silvio Horta was clever to pick both well-known legends as well as basically unknown ones to keep the unpredictability up. Also, the legends fitted the characters he created better than I had expected. A scene that is particularly effective is when Natalie hears her roommate's strangulated cries from her bed across the room but ignores them - thinking that they are cries of sexual ecstasy. To say she got a shock the next morning is a bit of an under-statement. Also cleverly handled is the idea that perhaps most of the murders are practical jokes or suicide cases (as Natalie's roommate is accused). This also, once again, shows how well the writer chose the legends.The acting is consistent and believable, particularly enjoyable performances come from Alicia Witt (a surprisingly unusual choice for a lead in a horror movie, but still an excellent choice), Joshua Jackson and Rebecca Gayheart - all respected actors and actresses in the teen commercial circle. A nice cameo from Robert Englund was also great, and he had a surprisingly small part, although he does manage to keep the viewer suspcious of where his loyalties lie. Although a couple of characters are annoying from the word 'go', that is just another believable aspect of this movie - wherever you go these days you are confronted by self-involved, obnoxious teenagers!The directing is probably the greatest aspect of the movie, and Jamie Blanks creates a claustrophobic and unsettling atmosphere - even in murder or tension scenes that occur in daylight. Despite the movies flaws, the dazzling direction makes up nearly all mistakes in it's stylish-ness. The director knows that in 'chase' scenes the viewer needs to know the full layout of a building to feel fear for a character's whereabouts (i.e if you know the door is only just around the corner the tension mounts when you know how close to surviving a characters is) - and so a lot of good, open shots are given on the screen.Over all, Urban Legend is a clever, frightening horror movie that boasts not only a good plot and original idea, but a brilliant score from Christopher Young.

THIS one is always going to hold a special place in my heart, and I'll tell you why.Three days before its release in 1998, it was broadcast, digitally, via satellite, to roughly 2 dozen colleges across the US.  It was not an isolated incident; previews have been brought to certain colleges in such a manner for nearly 10 years now.  My point, however, is that a free movie brings the kids out of the woodwork, and it was seeing this film with 500 screaming college kids that made it so great, in my mind.People yelled, they threw things, they made loud fun of the dumb white people that seem to populate every horror film ever made.  Don't go in there!  Look in the backseat!  Don't run UP the stairs, you pinhead!Whatever.  People were screaming and throwing things at the screen, which is what they should be doing.  I recommended it to a friend, and watched it again three days later, at an early showing with 20 people in the theater.  Suddenly the movie was bad, it was SO bad.  I didn't get it.Behold, the power of a community, visceral experience.  The movie was good for that; not for sitting at home alone to watch it, or watching it alone in a big theater (which is exactly how most paid film critics watch ALL movies).  It's not high art, but it was a great time at the movies that day, which is why, regardless of the IMDB, I still have to give it a 7/10.

The problem is the plotholes. Like how could the killer get in the backseat? How did the killer know where Alicia Witt and Josh Jackson were going? How could the killer talk to Danielle Harris on the net when he/she was in her room? The script is dumb, but thankfully grim and full of funny moments. I honestly wasn't sure who the killer was the first time around (it was painfully obvious the second) but the ending was just a disappointment. As a matter of fact, the movie was great up until it took a huge nosedive when the killer was revealed. Simply terrible. Thankfully the movie moves at a good pace and never gets boring.ACTING I loved Alicia Witt in this movie. She gets some bad dialouge, but does both emotion and sarcasm very well. Not to mention that she's absolutely beautiful. I was pulling for her to survive. Rebecca Gayheart is funny at the end when she gets to cut lose, but gives a terrible performance that really dragged the flick down. Her expressions always made me laugh...that's not a good thing. Tara Reid does okay, but we could've used more of her. Joshua Jackson and Michael Rosembeum are funny as hell as the comedic frat boys. They really helped the movie. Brad Dourif, Robert Englund, and Danielle Harris all have great cameos. Did I mention that Danielle Harris is really REALLY HOT? Little Jamie Llyod is all grown up...DIRECTING Jamie Blanks made a fan out of me here and continued to do so with VALENTINE. He does everything with lots and lots of style. He even does well building some good suspense when the weak script allows it. He didn't pull off ANY of the jump scares though. I liked how his murders were often intense yet showed little to no blood. The openner and the bathroom scenes stand out. I think Blanks could be the next big thing if he finally gets the right script. Maybe he should try writing his next movie himself...MUSIC Rob Zombie, Stabbing Westward, loads of other great stuff.

The idea of that sounded very cool to me, as I was quite sick of the teen slasher Scream clones at that point. So did we get the supernatural movie I was hoping for? Of course not. Sadly this film turned out to be just another teen slasher Scream clone, and a bad one at that. I was so disappointed that it was just another teen slasher the rating dropped two points in my mind just from that fact alone. They tried to make it a little different by giving the killer an urban legend theme to the killings but unfortunately it just boils down to the ever tired who done it teen thriller. We start off with a girl watching all her friends and people around her being killed off and we soon figure out the killer is pretty much just after her (sound familiar Scream fans?). We go through the whole list of the cast trying to figure out just who the killer is and why the person is killing people (still sound familiar Scream fans?). As I said this is just a badly done Scream clone.Acting wise it's ok at best. The main girl is not bad and Robert Englund (Freddy as we all know and love him for) is pretty good too. Sadly the other main person (the school news reporter) is really quite bad and very annoying. A lot of the other acting was pretty bad too but thankfully they were all in the background for the most part. You remember the little girl from the Halloween movies that Michael chased around? Well she's the gothic roommate here and also very annoying.When the end finally happens the killer isn't too hard to figure out and the reason this person is killing people is really rather stupid. And if they were going to make a movie about urban legends why didn't they use any of the good ones? To this day I can't believe they made a part two.  What scares me more is I heard rumors of a third part, if there really is a god he won't let this happen. If you are lucky enough to have not seen this movie go rent Scream again, it's pretty much the same.

Any movie of this type which suceeds in doing that deserves kudos in my book.     compare it to the Friday the 13th movies, which are basically Jason goes around and kills a lot of stupid teenagers plot, and you'll see how refreshing Urban Legends is, it actually has a well thought out script! of course it has cliches, but what are slasher movies without them, it's all part of the fun. The thing is it doesn't have TOO MANY cliches. It is better than I know what you did last summer, and comes really close to Scream. The direction deserves a word of praise, Jaimy Blanks first feature is extremely well done and stylish, he learned a lot from his mentor John Carpenter.The cast is uniformly good and believable, and it even has humor, as a self-concious modern flick should.

It's the legend about the young, naive woman with the unnoticed murderer lurking in the backseat of the car, but you've all heard that one. . .The cast contains all of the well-respected (by teens, of course) stars, few which are the product of popular TV shows centering around the lives of dazed and confused adolescents. Dawson Creek's Joshua Jackson is an ignorant and often innappropriate character, unlike his character in the show. His wittiness contributes to the overall comedic value of the film. However, his rude comments are made after another college student has been axed, and it's incredibly unrealistic that a person could be insensitive to that level, but his adorableness distracts viewers from the appalling qualities of his jokes.This film will appeal to all move-goers who have been dealt their share of urban legends. It contains the dog in the microwave legend, which proves quite disgusting, and probably the most common--- the bloody Mary legend. This does make several scenes in the movie quite predictable, but nonetheless, excitement and familiarity adds to the viewer's enjoyment. The stolen kidney legend is also featured, as well as the ridiculous rumor that pop rocks will cause explosion in your stomach when mixed with Coca-Cola.The conclusion isn't too predictable--it's almost surprising after your suspicions are laid on another mysterious character. It truly makes you wonder who to trust. . .Somehow, the movie manages to like all these legends together in an uncomplicated plot which contains stereotypical drunken college students who ignore all warnings from adults and just have fun. The students are forewarned multiple times of an event that occurred years before and left no survivors. Of course, they are cautioned on the anniversary of the deaths, fearing that it may occur again.I have seen this movie three or four times, and it doesn't become tiresome. The overall theme of urban legends is clever, and the movie is well-done.

Better than most of a slew of teen horror films that came out around the same time, Urban Legend takes an unexplored premise, what if all those urban legends that you hear about, actually came true?, and makes it work.  Taking place at the fictional Pendelton University, it revolves around a group of friends who start being killed off one by one in ways which resemble urban legends.  Now it is up to Natalie (Witt) to find out who is doing this before she is next.  Loretta Devine is hilarious as the security guard obsessed with Pam Grier and Robert Englund is good in what amounts to little more than a cameo appearance.

Yes, this is your typical teen slasher film, but the plot was kind of different. I liked *almost* everything about it.As I said, the plot and story circling around...urban legends was a different sort of dive from the other teen (horror) films. The writing wasn't terrific, wasn't awful. In fact, it was pretty enjoyable. The casting was all backwards. (I'll explain that in a minute.) The different murder scenes were a little off balance, and most of them I had a problem with.The opening scene with Michelle was interesting. I liked it for some reason and thought that the rest of the film would continue a good stream of killings. I don't sit there waiting for another character to be killed off but having everyone die the same death gets a little boring.~*Spoiler if you don't know who the killer is. I don't know why you wouldn't but I thought that I would announce this.~*The casting must have been done in about ten minutes. While I did enjoy the film overall, I did not enjoy the actors that were chosen to play the parts of a couple of college students. The cast could pass as college kids. I'll give them that much. The main part which I would consider Natalie, was played by a very funny actress. Not funny like ha ha, but funny because she definitely could not play the part as a poor little girl being chased by a killer. Most of the scenes that she was in where she tried to be serious, I couldn't help but laugh. Rebecca Gayheart's character, Brenda, was a little confusing. Here you have a girl that runs around like a princess but when it comes down to doing the dirty work, she seems to have no problem. I thought that it was very hard to buy that Gayheart's character could actually be the psycho who kills off a good amount of people. Jared Leto was okay but why was he listed at the top of the credits? He had a very small part. For the screen time that he was given, I could handle his character of Paul. The 'pretty boy' might want to stay away from so called horror films. The other main actors such as Michael Rosenbaum, Tara Reid and Joshua Jackson were pretty good as opposed to..say Alicia Witt. Rosenbaum had a very minor role but he probably did the best. He took what little he had and made it good to watch. Reid doesn't strike me as the radio host/whatever else she intended to be. I just want to note that her death was so over done. And Jackson who is always enjoyable to watch continued to add some funny lines, but again his death was ridiculously unbelievable. Anyone else who I overlooked must not have been that good if I can't even remember them. Cast partly well done, partly hilarious for trying to capture the roles that the actors could obviously not accomplish.While 'Urban Legend' had its share of good scenes, there was a number of bad things. One of them was the killer. Now we all now that it was the innocent looking little Brenda. Am I really supposed to believe that a girl like that was able to kill how many people, half if not more being guys who were easily twice her size? That part was a little too unrealistic but I'll try to accept it. The other thing was the murder/death scenes. Most of them were too drawn out. They tried to make a huge something out of something that wasn't even there. Most and probably the majority of the viewers of this movie found it as just another film with a group of youngsters who try to carry out the name of 'teen horrors.' I too had some problems with it but I would watch it again.

Sure, it has the same set up for all the teen slashers that have come up, guy/girl in a weird costume killing screaming college students. No matter how many new horror movies they are going to make, it's all going to follow this same setup. The plot is original, it's in no way like Scream. A killer  wearing a fur lined parka (ok, the costume is a bit blaah) starts knocking off students at Pendleton University based on urban legends. The murders focus around Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt) who tries to figure out why she is being stalked. Now if someone can tell me all the similarities between Scream and this movie based on the plot, I would love to know. The murders in this are creative, using legends such as The Murderer in the Backseat, the Hanging Boyfriend and the Slasher Under the Car, stuff we have heard about from a friend that heard from a friend, etc. There are some momentary jumpy parts, and a good chase scene in a radio station, and how can anyone NOT like that ending? The acting in this is good for the people involved, Alicia Witt sometimes stumbles into stone, but for the most part she is pretty good. Also, Tara Reid and Rebecca Gayheart are great, and yes, Gayheart definitely does overact but that is what makes her awesome, especially at the end. Rest of the cast is so so, although Loretta Divine is funny and we do care about her as the Chief of Security Reese (She also has one of the funniest lines in the film). Featured also is Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger himself) as a professor of folklore and John Neville (from The X-Files) as Dean Adams.Urban Legend doesn't rank up there with The Exorcist, A Nightmare On Elm Street, and other classics, and yes, it does have it's fair share of dumb moments (who exactly would wear a parka to a swimming pool?!) but it does have it's fair share of scares and jumps and suspense, and it is better than some of the other trash that has come out in the past 10 years (with the exception of Candyman of course!).

We have an interesting cast, some cool secrets learned, some interesting history, etc. What makes this feel like a Scream imitator is the use of suspense, slasher-chasing-victim scenes and the use of unpredictability among the cast.Suspense is good but not as many as I hoped. The slasher-chasing-victim scenes have expression but felt predictable. As for the use of unpredictability, I admit I kept on guessing who's the guilty one, ala Scream. The revelation of the guilty one caught me by surprise.The story of the film feels kinda weak when compared to Scream, but then again it's not the priority here. Alicia Witt is the only good performer here, and it's great that she's the lead. While nowhere as expressive or emotional as Scream's Sydney Prescott, Alicia fits well as Natalie, who at times, does not feel right as a victim. Robert Englund of Nightmare on Elm Street-fame is here, but his exposure is way too short.People who edited this film deserve a huge slap in the face. There was a part when the guilty one stabbed Natalie on her tummy with a small surgical knife, and it bled a good amount. Shortly after that scene, Natalie got untied, stood up and went on with the story...if you looked carefully, she does not look and does not feel any pain or injury. She should be getting weaker, wanting to go to the nearest medical center, holding her tummy more to stop bleeding, and there should be more blood from her!Overall, Urban Legend is a below-average film as it tried to ride on Scream's success.

Almost all of the comments that apply to Urban Legend can be applied to Scream but very few people criticise the latter but everyone seems to criticise the former. Don't get me wrong.. I was a big fan of Scream because it was simply entertainment - and good entertainment at that. There was no reason to analyse the script to bits or point out numerous things wrong with the plot. If you were to do that, I Know What you Did Last Summer would simply drown before it even had a chance, yet it was successful too simply because in both those movies, you could forget all these things and enjoy slash after slash. Who cares if it was feasible or not - they arn't the type of movies that need to be analysed since they often poke fun at themselves too; its all part of the ride. The plot twists in the film are definitely good but if you are going to watch the flick thinking its going to be a second rate Scream, then you're probably not going to give it much of a chance anyway.At the end of the day one word sums up what Urban Legend does - entertain, and IMHO, does it of course better than Last Summer, but also Scream. People will say that Urban Legend pretends to be horror while Scream was simply humerous but the introduction of Scream was far too horrific to be the start of a comic-horror flick; it also has an identiy crisis and its ending was far more ludicrous that Urban Legend's ending by far.At the end of the day, if Scream hadn't existed, most of these comments wouldn't be here in my opinion since this would have been its replacement. Although it loses marks for originiality since it was basically another 'Scream' movie, it seems to take everything from Scream and make it much better so whats wrong with that?Two thumbs up here  lets hope the second movie doesn't disappoint.

Loretta Divine is charming as the security guard whom says a silent prayer to  Pam Grier before she confronts danger. And Robert Englund is always a welcome addition to any horror movie's cast. The performance of our heroine, Alicia Witt, is a little stale, but the action more than makes up for that. The ending is of the type that makes you sit upright and say OHHHHH SO THAT'S WHY!!! Then, there's a twist. And it gets resolved. And then ANOTHER twist, then that gets resolved.

I Know What You Did Last Summer made a lot of money for Columbia Pictures, so this film Urban Legend was inevitable. Urban Legend takes place on a campus, where teenagers are being brutally killed in extremely cruel ways, and the murderer seems to kill people according to the urban legends, stories that are told to us by friends and parents.SPOILERS AHEADThe Acting pretty much terrible. Jared Letto, in his first big role in a motion picture, does a fairly ordinary job, and he doesn't have the charm to carry the movie. Alicia Witt was boring, and we didn't get to like her, nor care. Rebecca Gayheart is terrible as the psycho killer, in the end of the film her character shows to Alicia Witt why she is blowing away her teen friends. Gayheart, instead of suggesting danger, makes you laugh out loud, she exaggerates a lot and gives a terrible performance.The only good acting came from Tara Reid, sweet and outstanding, why she didn't get the main part of the film is beyond me.Robert Englund, of Freddy Krueger's fame, makes a cool cameo, Brad Dourif also shines in a small part.The Story this is almost a good point of the film. You really don't get to discover who is the crazy bastard killing the teens until the last ten minutes. But it has a lot of plot roles, illogical sequences and boring parts.However, the beginning of the film is great, and the end, even with Gayheart's bad acting, is also great.The Suspense well, this is a fairly poor movie when it comes to heart and suspense. It didn't have the same appeal of I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream, because you really know when something is going to happen.The only sequences that bring chills are the beginning and the ending.The Violence extreme violence. A lot of blood and guts, but if you want to see something really grotesque and violent, check Hellbound Hellraiser 2 out!In the end, what you get from this film is a mediocre entertainment. It had many chances to become an excellent thriller, but bad acting and bad director turned this into a complete mess. Two great scenes can't save the whole movie.If you want to see really GREAT horror films, you should watch Hellbound Hellraiser 2, Deadly Friend and The Hills Have Eyes.

Again the end product is a more or less poor attempt of making a movie with the quality of Scream. And again the film-makers tried to be original and again they failed for the most part.A killer that is imitating urban legends. Basically that's all the story is about. Nonetheless there are a few cool scenes (but I won't spoil them for you). The death scenes are sometimes inventive but can't make this film look any better. It is also weird at times. Suddenly all of the persons were wearing the same coat so that everyone could have been the killer (very original). And there is the final twenty or so minutes terrible. It starts off weird, then gets ridiculous and finally it is illogical. The actor/actress playing the killer did a poor job. Trying to act like a psychotic, freakish person he/she gets more and more ridiculous and I just couldn't help laughing at him/her. Then they were trying to be original (again this word) by showing one last surprise at the very end but even there they were unsuccessful.Another mistake is that nearly all the interesting (or at least not-so-boring) characters are being killed off in the first half of the film. The only highlight in this film is Robert Englund (whether he is killed or not you will find out when/if watching the film).But maybe I'm being a little hard. The film is still entertaining but the comedy elements are definitely better than the scenes that are supposed to scare you out of your Alicia wi(t)ts (hahaha, I'm so incredibly funny).

After many more college students and administrators are killed, it is later found out that the murderer at Pendleton University is mimicking the tales of commonly told Urban Legends. Excitement builds up as the audience anxiously awaits the moment in which the killer will finally be revealed.Brutal killings including heinous decapitation and deathly asphyxiation occur frequently throughout Urban Legend. One almost grows accustomed to the gruesome sight of a human cadaver. At one point in the movie, a college student `gets a call coming from inside the house.' `Scream' anyone? Of course after receiving the phone call, the young man within minutes dies an appalling death that should strike fear into the minds of any viewer.Believe it or not, on rare occasions, the audience is spared the display of what would have otherwise been a grotesque corpse.Urban Legend is a suspenseful movie that contains an ample amount of homicides, executed with a mild quantity of gore.

The plotline is that someone is killing students on a Northeastern college campus, by mimicing the murders in classic urban legends.The normally skilled Alicia Witt plays Natalie, a good girl with a slightly shaded past.  It seems that a couple years ago, a young man was accidentally killed while she and a friend played an urban legend prank.  She doesnt seem very interested in this role, and plays it as such.  Her fear is unbelieveable, and even her crying stinks of forced performance.Rebecca Gayheart continues to play ms. cute and cuddly.  Her character of Brenda also has a bit of a dark side, but to say any more would be foolish...The rest of the cast is either goofy or forgettable, with Joshua Jackson leading the way in both categories.  He is clearly out of his league in anything other than Dawson's Creek and even there he is outclassed by the rest of that cast. Tara Reid (from American Pie) plays a campus radio DJ whos main task seems to consist of wearing tight, very low cut tops, and unusually short skirts. Her show is also all about sex on campus, so we get the added thrill of her sexual advice...YAWWWNNNN.I think the reason most bad horror movies died out in the 80's was because that all the good holiday names were taken.

Maybe from looking at the comparisons I have made, you will come to notice how un original Urban Legend is. But, despite this, Urban Legend offers enough thrills to occupy the couple of hours of my life it takes up. Alicia Witt is very poor. I really hope that she wasn't looking for the same attention Neve Campbell received from Scream because she is going to be disappointed. Rebecca Gayheart is a very attractive, talented young actress who does well in this, despite the claustrophobia of her character. Jared Leto wasn't really given a chance to develop, but manages to do well in the small scenes he has. Tara Reid and Joshua Jackson are the great saviors. Their characters are both interesting, and well portrayed. Natasha Wagner and Brad Dourif provide the best scene however. Dourif is incredible as the stammering Gas Attendant who desperately tries to warn Wagner of the uninvited visitor in the back of her car. Although the characters are basically taken from Scream, the story of Urban Legend is brilliant. Jackson, Gayheart, Reid, Wagner and Dourif enjoy their scenes, whilst the others trail behind. Robert Englund puts up a lazy performance as the Urban Legend teacher, but still, I don't think that Urban Legend deserves the awful reviews it received from Empire and Total Film.

An urban legend is a fictitious tale which is supposedly based on a real-life incident...but with a shocking twist. Murder, frenzy, and eccentricity are the attributes of an urban legend. These urban legends are meant to scare people to death...and to discourage them from performing certain, immoral acts.At Pendleton University, the 25th Anniversary of the campus massacre by a demented professor is celebrated.  However, the festivities are about to be cut short...as the inhabitants at this college tremble in fear...  A student has been found decapitated, and this only starts a chain reaction...where the body count will slowly accumulate...  For a lunatic is taking these urban legends...and literally making them come alive!Natalie (Alicia Witt) is a new student at Pendleton University.  She is learning how to deal with her past trauma many years ago.  Enrolling in a course discussing about the nuts and bolts of modern folklore...Natalie is about to receive a life long lesson in hardship...A series of grisly murders have been reported at Pendleton University. What's even more taunting, these murders seem to be centering around Natalie's life.  Many of these real life murders that Natalie encounters are eerily copied from these notorious legends.  They include a death by hanging, a graphic torture scene, a hooded ax-wielding murderer hiding in the back seat of a car zeroing in on the kill, and the infamous charred poodle...Who is the killer?  Well, the probable suspects are either an overzealous student journalist (Jared Leto), Professor Wexler (Robert Englund) a renowned expert on modern folklore, Natalie's *jealous* best friend (Rebecca Gayheart), the college prankster (Joshua Jackson), or the college dean (John Neville).  Or could the murderer be someone closer to Natalie...The ultimate urban legend is about to unfold...I enjoyed URBAN LEGEND  a lot because it takes advantage of the same ingredients utilized in other recent stalk and slash hit features such as SCREAM (1996) and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (1997).  URBAN LEGEND manages to maintain high-octane suspense along with some dry black humor. The cast in URBAN LEGEND  is wonderful.  Alicia Witt in particular is great as a tough heroine who must unravel the clues in order to unmask the psychotic killer roaming around the campus.  Jared Leto and Joshua Jackson also provide a macabre sense of humor which is appropriate to the film's ominous tones.  Robert Englund also has a nice cameo as a college professor who is skeptical towards Natalie's allegations of these urban legends coming true.  Rebecca Gayheart is attractive as Natalie's seductive cohort.  The cast has a terrific time in this movie.URBAN LEGEND  is a tautly made horror film with plenty of scares, thrills, and gore.  Be forewarned, for the first 40 minutes of URBAN LEGEND  are deadly lame.  Be patient though, the film picks up the pace as the story progresses.  Although this film is not explicitly gory, it is sanguinary enough to please bloodhounds and to keep the squeamish screaming for their lives.As a slasher flick, URBAN LEGEND  is above average.  Your heart will beat faster and blood will rush down your body as you try to admonish the characters on screen to take certain precautions.  URBAN LEGEND  is surprisingly lightweight on the sauce department, but some efficient plot twists will keep most people captivated to the story.  Altogether, URBAN LEGEND  is a creative turn from the traditional killer goes on murder spree type sub-genre for the horror film category.   A substantively established fright show will keep you shrieking for more!  Ghoulish fun for fans.  Certainly better than your average psycho on the loose film.  The surprise ending is great!Next time, you better check the back seat of your car.  Who knows...maybe your fate will be sealed a lot faster than you think!RATING **1/2 out of ****.

Also there is some variation to all of the legends when they are acted out.

There was absolutely no hint of mystery whatsoever. None of the characters made any interesting theories about who the killer could've been (like Randy from Scream; by the way, Damon was a crap Randy) apart from Paul and what's her name accusing a certain character of being the killer when they find a piece of too hard evidence pointing towards him. Aren't these mysteries much better when you are following a main character who is trying to solve the case at a 'professional' level? e.g. Se7en (a serious film).These Guesswhodunnits are getting a little bit boring now. 'I know what you did.....' was OK but this is too ordinary. Just another Scream rip-off to me. I thought Scream was superior to UL because it was much more clever. Also, it actually had a killer that ran (what what what?) so it looked more realistic, not like the maniac in the parka jacket in UL that walked at snails pace and still managed to catch and kill his/her victims.

If you take it seriously as cinema or expect it to scare you, all but the young and inexperienced will be disappointed.  HOWEVER, there is a somewhat more subtle humor in the movie than one might expect, and the movie is certainly not as stupid as some of the reviewers have painted it to be (I could say something about insecurity in one's own intelligence in relation to some of the particularly scathing comments, but this is about the movie not the reviewers).  At any rate I highly recommend the DVD version, and in particular the writer/director/actor commentary, which despite the youth and inexperience of all three of them (this is the first movie for both writer and director) is by far the most informative I have yet heard as far as the filmmaking art and what kind of events go on behind the scenes that we rarely hear about.  They pack the entire movie with non-stop commentary on everyone and everything in the movie and several things not in the movie, as opposed to the U.S. Marshals DVD for instance, which asked me to skip ahead several chapters more than once because the director simply had nothing to say about the movie through those sections.  And I think accusations of plagerism from Scream are a bit unfair, since this is really just another movie in the same genre, and Scream is such a shining example of the tongue-in-cheek horror movie/dark comedy that everything else that fits the same genre for a while is going to be accused of copying.  I really don't see that this is a copy or rip-off of Scream any more than I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream2.  That said, the scripting is a little ham-fisted at times, and some of the humor isn't as intelligent (or as funny) as the niche they are aiming for demands.  The guys on the commentary track admit to quite a bit of the ham-fistedness in good humor, and give their own explanation of how it works with the theme of the movie. If you appreciate the visual quality of a movie as much as I do, this one is pretty impressive considering the youth of the crew and the relatively low budget of the film.  Much of the look was ripped-off from other movies (the movie is rife with homages to other movies, particularly in the horror genre, and these go right down to stylistic cues as detailed as camera movement), as other reviewers would say, but I am inclined to give the writer and director the benefit of the doubt and agree that these are appropriate homages to the cheap horror genre.Anyway, if you can't take a joke, or if you can't let go of your intellectual bloodlust enough that you can see the joke behind the camp, then do not see this movie.  If you can, get some friends and some beer and you may well enjoy this movie quite a bit.  At any rate you should definitely check out the commentary if the DVD ever comes into your hands.

Although it's not actually a great film, it's still definitely worth seeing. Plenty of bits made me jump, and although I had been told I would spot the killer and the motive early in the film, I didn't (and couldn't - some of the facts necessary to understand the motive weren't revealed until much later).Although I enjoyed _Scream (1996)_ a lot, I don't believe that from there onwards a horror film needs to be full of self-referential humour and in-jokes referring to other films to be good. What's happened here is someone has had an idea for a horror film, and then made it. If it was my first film I'd be pretty pleased with it.That out of the way, here's what I actually though of the film. The acting was, well, OK. I didn't watch it thinking Wow, but it did the job considering the budget was fairly low. And of course _Robert Englund_ made an appearance, to give it that authentic touch. The film was fairly sturdily directed (by that I suppose I mean uninspiring) - but again, it did the job. Spotting the pattern? In all, the film was entertaining and worth the money it cost to see it. Oh, and I didn't notice the in-joke about the commercial at the end, never mind get it!Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying this film is as brilliant as _Halloween (1978)_ or _Scream (1996)_, but I am saying it is far better than has been reported.

Neve Campbell), a soon-to-be-well-known script writer (a.k.a. Kevin Williamson), and a famous horror director (a.k.a. Wes Craven) than you might not call Urban Legend your typical horror film. Unlike the past Scream and I Know... movies, Urban Legend has its own, unique way of scaring you. Instead of ghostface popping out from behind a hidden door or the fisherman breaking through shower glass, the killer in Urban Legend doesn't just jump out and attack his victims, he makes them legends. He tends to put you in suspense almost making the movie come alive and feeling like reality. Just like the tagline says, just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't.The director chose well known legends almost everyone has heard of, such as the psycho in the backseat or the threatening phone calls to the babysitter which are coming from the children's bedroom. Since we know these stories so well it makes us feel like we are there and that we are the next victim. Even if you don't care for a character you almost feel sorry for them knowing exactly how they're going to die. The opening scene in the movie with Natasha Wagner in her car is by far the most suspenseful and scary part of the film. As you see the killer rise behind her, your heart starts pounding and you are hoping she turns around in time before he swings his axe. After this scene the legends are not as scary or threatening, but an action scene in which Tara Reid is pursued is rather gripping.As well as action, the film also has some funny and quite clever lines driven by Tara Reid's character Sasha while speaking over the radio with some freshman. This film was surprisingly scary and shockingly entertaining and I recommend it to all horror fans, but if you are a dog lover I strongly suggest to not see this film!

There were so many impossibilities in this film that one dosen't know where to start!  The killer was a joke- if *they* were so upset at the protagonist, they why oh why dont they just KILL THEM RIGHT AWAY????  I know.. Could it be because they needed a stupid excuse to drag out an otherwise good premise (a killer using Urban Legends as a motive) to an overwrought and over-the-top conclusion?   And as for the actors- what kind of college is this?  Are there any ugly people allowed there?  Alicia Witt looks drugged throughout the movie, which is probably the only way they could have got her to do the movie, Rebecca Gayheart needs to use some of that Noxeema she used to sell and wipe some makeup off her face.  As for the rest- I can't even tell who they were by name- it was sad..  They only existed as chum for the shark.   There were horrible cliches, such as the music jumps when someone would sneak up behind someone else (which, by the way were so loud that I thought my brains were leaking out of my ears by the end of the movie), a swimmer that wears a parka and combat boots to go to swim practice in, and so many others, not including the LAME-O ending that made me want to puke shards of glass rather than sit through a sequel.

The slasher movie has always been made, Scream was just clever enough to bring them back to the cinema.At the end of the day thay are all just slasher films about a crazed killer stalking and killing teenagers in a variety of fashions.Urban Legend goes for the 'killer on campus' area of the genre with a group of 'teens' falling prey to an unknown assassin and each getting murdered in highly imaginative ways (and I mean that)!Alicia Witt is the main star and although she is a good and very attractive actress, she is only minorly convincing.  She doesn't quite project her fear enough to get the viewer scared.  (Mariyln Burns was the last actress to achieve that with her relentless screaming in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - although Amy Steel came close in Friday 13th 2).There are a few impressive death scenes in Urban Legend, the hanging is particularly inventive and the opening scene is sure to make you gasp.Overall I enjoyed this movie, it is not trying to be clever and knows that it is just a run of the mill slasher flick. Some people criticised this movie, but it is still a lot better than the majority of the slasher films the 80s has to offer.

Had this film succeeded in developing the 'Urban Legend Serial Killer' concept, people would have been looking for psychos underneath their cars after leaving the theaters -- instead, they were laughing at how ridiculous this movie was.The most frustrating aspect of this movie was the incessant use of seemingly every horror cliche in the book (Well, not all of them. A Tara Reid shower scene might have at least made the movie interesting for a few minutes). I mean, the main character actually said, You know you'll never get away with this! The only thing worse than this cheesy dialogue is the cheesier dialogue recited by the actual killer in the final scene, which by the way is the worst ending to a film I've seen in years (If you have the patience to watch the movie all the way through, however, be sure to compare the dialogue, setting, and resolution to a recent Simpsons 'Treehouse of Horrors' episode.  Now you'll now where third-rate screenwriters get their ideas from.)There were some decent moments in the film, however, including a relatively exciting opening scene. Unfortunately, the highlights of the movie are the little inside jokes the director slips in. Had he spent as much time on on the rest of the plot as these in-jokes, I would have really enjoyed this film.The ending of this film will leave the viewer asking many questions.  For example  Why does the legend that surrounds this fictional university (and takes up a good 1/3 of the dialogue) have nothing to do with the plot? Why is the same 'eerie' chord played whenever anyone bumps into another character?  And why does everyone have the same stupid coat?!? These questions are never answered, and neither is the most important question of all -- why would anyone pay $7 to see this movie, when a 99 cent rental of a '70s horror flick with a $500 budget would be just as thrilling?One final note. There is a particularly gruesome scene involving a dog in the film. Therefore I would recommend that members of PETA stay away from this movie. For everyone else, I recommend that you join PETA so that you too can stay away from this movie.

Or what about the improbability that a person can fall many floors from a window, land on solid ground, but still manage to get back up and go for the kill again? Also, what made the stories scary, was very simple. The actual danger was not realized until after the fact. It was at that point when the characters realize how close they were to the danger.

I thought, Wow, they are really running out of ideas when they resort to KILLER ESKIMOS as masked murderers!!.  Needless to say I went into this movie with extremely low expectations.  Well, the opening scene was surprisingly suspenseful and well-done.  (I especially thought the use of the song Turn Around Bright Eyes at the climax of the scene was BRILLIANT!).  This opening scene rivals the openings of SCREAM and SCREAM 2.  Anyway, that was the best part of the movie for me.  There were some very original death scenes also and I thought Jaime Blanks directorial debut was superb.  You couldn't take the movie too seriously though... because if you did you'd be able to point out all the plot holes and realize that the revelation of the killer is ludicrous. (I actually guessed the correct killer 15 minutes into the movie though.  Honestly, I just picked the LEAST LIKELY person and got lucky).

Who cares what some people are saying about this one... those same people are the ones who only saw Scream because their horror loving friends talked them into it and only saw this one wanting to compare it to Scream anyway. Thus, their comments are worthless. The slasher sub-genre isn't for English Patient loving buffoons... so ignore what the critics say.

The movie was never boring, unlike the majority of I Know What You Did Last Summer and the middle of Scream 2.  The movie followed the simple rule of maintaining a consistently high body count in order to keep boredom from setting in.  I believe their was at least one death every 10-15 minutes.  The deaths were creative and twisted, the characters were amusing, and the guessing game was fun.  The killer was unbelievable, but was at least more interesting than the killers in IKWYDLS or Scream 2. If you like slasher films you'll enjoy Urban Legend.

After all, the plot of a killer utilizing urban legends to off his victims is brilliant. I left the theatre pleased with the movie I'd seen, but disappointed at how much better it could have been. This is definately one of those movies that seems worse and worse the more you think about it.The main problem with this movie is it tries so hard to be Scream that the story becomes tedious. The movie revolves almost solely around Alicia Witt's character, making her akin to Neve Campbell's Sidney. The problem here is that the deaths occuring in the movie are much closer related to Alicia's character. You can't help but stop and ask, If all your friends are dying off why are you staying in this freaky college? Alicia's character degenerates to being a paranoid, whinny, annoying presence.Another problem from having the movie revolve around Alicia Witt is that the other characters in the movie are way overshadowed. You never get the sense of who the other characters are. In Scream, you got to know Randy's (Jamie Kennedy) character very well. The same goes for I know what you did last summer.Finally, the movie is extremely predictable. I saw it with two of my friends and we each had the killer pinned half way through the movie. Its also very obvious who's going to die, making the only interesting part how they're going to die. Contrary to the movie's title, not all the deaths appear to be based on urban legends, and most of the ones that are turn out very lame. There is only one really good urban legend killing, and that's the very first one you see (which is probably the best part of the movie). The ending of the movie is also predictable, but is disturbingly appropriate nonetheless.All in all, this is Scream, except the killer isn't as interesting to look at, the deaths aren't as interesting, there's no mystery, its bloodier, there are more cheap scares, the characters are lamer, and the ending isn't as gratifying. On a horror movie scale of 1-10 (10 being Scream, 8 being I know..., and Jason goes to hell as 1) Urban Legend is probably a 6. If you're going to see this movie, try to get a discounted ticket.

Someone dressed up as an Eskimo. I'm aware of many of the Urban Legends that are mentioned in the movie and none of them have anything to do with arctic natives. The one thing I do like about this movie  it fits right into the category of 'slasher' movie.  I will quote a line from the movie 'Scream'  It's just about a big breasted girl who can't act getting chased by some psycho in a mask, and she runs up the stairs when she should run outside! It's insulting!  End quote. And I will say that the acting sucked, although one of them did an okay job.

But instead of doing something original with these elements, the film instead feeds us stale cliches, like a creepy janitor who startles people when they turn around (with aid from the film-maker in the form of sudden music and white flashes).The story begins with a promising, suspenseful murder. But once the action moves to Pendleton University, it collapses under its own weight.  An hour of suffering through the contrived, patchwork scenes full of stilted dialogue convinced me that the writer was making it up as he went along, and moreover, that he'd never been to an American college.  This is a school with one security guard, one dean, one professor, one student reporter and a huge building whose sole purpose seems to be to provide a good place for a murder.Instead of ending after the obligatory climactic party scene, the film runs from set to set for another half an hour, piling up murders and red herrings.

Instead of a killer fascinated with scary movies, this killer is more interested in bring urban legends to life. Though, unlike Scream, which brought together a lot of famous actors, UL takes actors who are just making a name for themselves (with the exception of course being Robert England, who has already established himself as a Grade A actor.) Aside from maybe a little overacting in the last two minutes of the movie, all the actor do an excellent job.  The writer threw in so many red herrings that the plot will keep you guessing. Although the movie is produced by the same people who produced I Know What You Did Last Summer, don't let that scare you away.  Some people seem to clump this generation's horror movies together, but UL is nothing like IKWYDLS.  UL keeps you entertained with excellent recreations of the urban legends we've all heard, instead of just showing victim after victim being killed by a man with a hook. If you're a fan or urban legends, or real-life horror/who-dun-it movies, then this is a high recommendation.  What I mean by real-life horror is a movie like Scream, which doesn't rely on supernatural elements (such as movies like Halloween, Hellraiser, Friday the 13th, etc...) If you're just looking for guts and gore, or an hour and a half of a heroin running from a ghostly killer who comes back to life in every sequel, look into one of the three movies in the sentence above.  But if you want entertainment, suspense, and violence without all the mess, then check out Urban Legend.

This is definitely one that brings nothing new to the life of the horror movie than an interesting premise.  I have read Ebert's review of the movie and discovered that I strongly agree with him on the movie's sole reliance on the clang effect for making the audience jump.  It's where the camera is close up on the character's faces and the viewer knows something is going to happen,  tension rises, and then...CLANG.  Everyone jumps and maybe the killer is there or maybe he isn't.  After an hour of clangs I stopped jumping.  Still, the ride is fun.  The movie is interesting until the end. I was a little disappointed in the way the ending evolved and concluded. But what can you do?  Most horror movies end badly, but this one has your stereotypical somebody's-gone-over-the-deep-end individual who needs to exact revenge.

Around my hometown, we had an urban legend where movies which were takeoffs of more popular movies were actually worth paying movie admission for.

Urban Legend is the movie to break the streak.        The movie is a standard who done it?, hack and slash movie with the underlying story taken from Scream, the plot a takeoff of I Know What You Did Last Summer and the plot twists resembling Wild Things. While I tried to take my eyes off the Claire Danes look-a-like on screen, I attempted to figure out who the killer was.  The only reason I couldn't figure it out had to do with the revealing material the Sydney Prescott wanna be was wearing. A brief appearance was made by Robert Englund, or Freddy Kruger as we know him better as.  Also Danielle Harris, the hot chick who played Molly, a girl that lived next door from Darlene on the TV show Rosanne, has a minor roll as a poser, err goth.  Lastly Joshua Jackson from Dawson's Creek makes a brief appearance accomplishing nothing. The only good thing about this movie is the ending, which made me vote it a 9.

And this they did... and Urban legends for the most part is a great film, full of suspense and clever twists and manages to keep you guessing and as paranoid as the characters in the film. But it is ruined towards the end by an unlikely conclusion and a stupid ending; the end products of a Titanic that just steamed ahead and sunk before it reached it's destination.Like many cynics, I approached this film not expecting a whole lot. Despite being a huge fan of the horror genre, and in particular, slashers, too often a time have I been disappointed, and found myself violated even, by an absolutely atrocious and dumb slasher film - and there are many! The list would exceed the length of my arm. But Urban legend was an exception... the majority of it, anyway. With a superb opening, involving - SOMEONE'S IN THE BACK SEAT - that sent such chills down my spine, this looked on it's way to be a great one. But could it hold up? For an hour at least... and then it began to get predictable I thought... but was it? After messing around with our heads for awhile, Silvio Horta then delivered his final twist - which essentially ruined the whole picture! I don't' know, maybe it was just me, but I just found the identity of the killer to be a complete let down and an insult to the audience. It was pathetic really, and the ending was just oh so typical. And thats how a film showing such potential and class all through, even managing to have me biting my knuckles and sitting on the edge of my seat, ended up with a rating of just 4. Sporting a great cast that includes Jared Leto (The Thin Red Line, Requeim For a Dream) in a brilliant performance as the live-in journalist who rats around the campus looking for clues and information regarding the murders, and an event known as the Stanley Hall Massacre which is an urban myth in itself - did it happen or not? on the campus all them many years ago. Tara Reid from American Pie also stars, alongside Alicia Witt and best of all - Robert Englund - Freddy Krueger! - in a brilliant performance as Prof. Wexler. Also starring is the very familiar Julian Richings, a creepy, charismatic guy who you'll recognise no problem if you see him in anything else. He plays the 'weird janitor', and when asked how long he's been working on the campus, his abrupt reply is Too damn long!. Maybe it was because they were the first words he spoke in the film, but that had me in stitches. That, and the deans remarks about the whereabouts of a missing student - He is probably shacked up in some motel somewhere with a girl - or a boy... or a farm animal! Weren't you ever eighteen? A decent film for the most part, but I just found the last fifteen minutes to be god-awful, and enough for me to drop it down to a rating of 4.

I find it an extremely effective addition to the horror genre. The monster success of SCREAM (1996) brought with it a resurgence of the teen horror slasher genre that had such success in the late 70s and 80s. URBAN LEGEND is the first one to come out after SCREAM. It is a simplistic tale told with solid doses of mystery, humor, and flair. An unseen figure in a parka is killing off students at the college campus of Pendleton, using ideas from urban legends to pull off the killings.The start of URBAN LEGEND is very scary and interesting as college student Michele Mancini (played by Natasha Gregson Wagner) is driving late at night and pulls over at a gas station run by a spooky attendant (veteran actor Brad Dourif who's done a lot of spooky roles). While Michele thinks the attendant is about to accost her and maces him to get away, he actually was trying to warn her that someone was in her backseat, our film's killer. Michele is killed.Cut to Pendleton College campus where we meet the film's 6 protagonists Paul, Natalie, Brenda, Damon, Parker, Sasha (played respectively by Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Michael Rosenbaum, and Tara Reid). They all seem to have a fun fascination with urban legends, but when they find Michele is killed, Natalie (the film's lead) takes it to another level and thinks there is more than meets the eye. But no one believes her. The campus dean doesn't want negative publicity (25 years before, there was a mass murder at one of the men's dorms).Actually more than the typical teen horror flick, it is a great forerunner to the the 21st century, with the 'urban legend' twist. It's one of those movies that has a high re-watchability factor. It's nice to pick up on clues that you might not have seen the first couple times. Also in the flick are Loretta Devine (very funny as campus security chief Reese) and Mr. Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger himself!) playing a college professor (rather well, actually).

However, this serial killer has a bit of a different intention. He/she kills people by way of old urban legends that were never really true... until now.Although the premise of URBAN LEGEND is much more interesting and original than that of most teen slasher movies, it's still a very mediocre movie. Some of the actors, i.e. Alicia Witt and Jared Leto, are actually good actors, but they're given nothing to work with and thus don't show their talent. The screenplay is bad and at times even ridiculous, especially Natalie's flashback sequence and the scene in which the killer confesses his/her motive. Speaking of which, those scenes are total cliches, and there are many more of those horror film cliches present in this movie, including the helpless, defenseless girls who get killed, the inevitable hookup, and the crazy old man at the gas station.However, this movie does have a couple of good points. The premise, as I said, is pretty intriguing and original, and there are a couple of good twists in the plot. One minute you're convinced that one person did it, then your mind gets changed in a matter of minutes.

For stories like this the mind is the greatest director, as it can create atmosphere and tension. Unfortunately, the film goes for simple slashings of college kids.

The atmosphere of the movie is a large part of what makes it so good. Picture a New England mansion while it's raining in the dark. That's the feel of the college - and inside a comfortable home like area where the central characters hang out. The beginning interactions with these friends make them all very believable and real. Not shallow or just there to scream, run and get killed. One of the classes is about urban legends so the theme of the movie is are these really just urban legends or are they real? It's the 25th anniversary of the school's so-called massacre. Most students don't believe it but as friends go missing or turn up dead, one of the main characters, Natalie, believes it is not only real, but someone after her. Watching it now, so many years later, it's amazing how well known most of the actors have become. I was shocked to read that Michael Rosenbaum from the TV show, 'Smallville', was in this movie as one of the main characters. He looks so different, I would never have made the connection. And I've seen this movie a lot. I read someone call it predictable but I didn't think so at all. It was suspenseful to the end. Not knowing who you could really trust. Even after knowing what happens, something about this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. The characters become real and the ominous looking school with grounds going towards the woods gives it a real feeling of a New England town.

Do you watch movies for the storyline? Or do you watch for who is in the movie. Now if you are all saying storylines, you are lying, why? Well because we see previews and are attracted to wanting to watch the movie based on who is in it. Which brings me to Urban Legend. Now sure Urban Legends are interesting myths, folklore but put them into a movie with, remember a big with, an attractive cast and bang, you have a successful movie. Horror movie mind you. Remember horror movies are always criticized by those older and mature viewers who always say, this is crap when thier movie collection consists of every hit horror movie from the 80's. Rebecca Gayheart is a sexy hottie, and all guys will agree no matter what. Tara Reid isn't? Ya sure guys, she is as hot as can be in this one and in American Pie. Throw in Jared Leto for the women and Joshua Jackson as well and it looks like we have a cast who is not only known but attractive. That is what sells a movie, and put them into a horror movie that viewers will relate to, meaning folklore myths..Urban Legends and we have the hook, line and sinker. SO all in all this movie is a good horror movie, regardless of it's rip offs. Almost all movies of any genre are rip offs of previous similar movies. this horror movie is not crap, is entertaining and that is the word so many people seem to forget when it comes to watching movies and tv.

Then they would spend their time getting high underneath the bleachers in the gym.I think the scriptwriter for this film went to that university.Urban Legend is the kind of uninspired film-making that makes me depressed. Here was an excellent opportunity for a creepy satire or even an ominous spookfest. Instead they have given us a bargain-basement Scream clone.I've noticed an alarming trend in the poster art for modern horror films like this one. They feature a montage of the cast member's faces standing around as if they are posing for a group shot at somebody's glamorous funeral. No smiles (this is a horror movie, after all), but damn are they trying to look sexy. Don't believe me? Look at the poster art for this movie, Halloween H20, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc. The art is as uninspired as the films themselves, and it represents the very thing that these films stand for a routine assemblage of nonsensical clich√©s and situations.For instance- the first murder features a character getting her head cut off with an axe while the killer sits in the back seat. Ever try to swing an axe from the back seat of a vehicle, especially hard enough to cut off someone's head?- the killer instigates an Internet IM chat with one of the characters and tries to set up date with her in order to lure her to her death. The girl types Where are you? and then illogically walks away from the PC to go put on her makeup. When she comes back, the killer has typed IN YOUR ROOM!!! and lunges at her. Gee, what perfect timing and foresight this killer must have, to have been able to anticipate that this girl would walk away from her PC before seeing IN YOUR ROOM!!! pop up in the IM box. But like...since the murderer was just gonna sneak into her room and kill her, why the pretense of IMing her, anyway?I guess some of this was supposed to be spoofy instead of spooky, but I found it to be witless, dull, and boring. The only memorable thing from the film was how utterly annoying and predictable the plot was. I particularly got a howl out of the conclusion, where the two surviving characters drive away from the scene of the crime in their car while reciting plot details just like characters in an old radio play. Boy Sam, I sure am glad we got away from that terrible serial killer and are now on our way to safety. I sure am glad we didn't accept that ambulance ride, I much prefer driving in our own car along a deserted road. Yes Jane, but you don't think the killer could still be alive & hiding in the back seat, do you??? AAAIIIEE!!!!!Honorable mention The security guard who idolizes Pam Grier.

Therefore, I had no beef with it.Of course, then came the clones.  And the second smearing of horror's name in the last two decades.  Whiles the eighties had such classics as the original Nightmare on Elm Street and Hellraiser, most eighties horror consisted of explicit gore and dead teenagers.  Nothing scary.The early to mid-nineties started off well for horror, I thought.  We had intelligent horror films like Candyman and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Well-written horror that was actually scary.  Then came Scream.  And all that changed.Scream ushered in a brand of horror that was self-referential, utilizing humor and gore over suspense and scares.  Every horror movie since has followed the same formula.  There's no such thing as originality anymore. Gone are the days of creative horror movies, such as the Phantasm and Evil Dead series.  In are schlock films such as Urban Legends, wherein teenagers walk around darkly lit rooms and bump into each other, screaming and spouting ridiculous dialogue until they're bumped off by the mad slasher. Films that, as I said, place gore and humor above scares.Is it so wrong to want to be scared by a horror film?  Is it so wrong to want to have the same feeling I got when I saw the original Halloween, taking in the creepy atmosphere, the suspense?  Is it so wrong to want to see a horror film that keeps me at the edge of my seat, instead of making me laugh at its complete ineptitude and self-referential story (or lack thereof)?

It's just a shame that the script wasn't polished up a little, as the ending should have been sorted out.The cast are great and nauseatingly beautiful, and the idea of an urban legend killer has to be up there with Ghostface, It's just the killers rant at the end of the film is so poor, it taints the rest of the film.It's not the performers fault, they are really good, the lines they spout are just too cringe inducing.With references to other films, not just horror, Urban Legend is one of those films you can watch, and then come across it a few years later and forgot who got killed and how.It's a guilty pleasure, good to look at, with some great editing, but the writers should have left out the speech and the fact that a lot of characters spend a lot of time running in the rain.

It came out after Scream when all of these sorts or movies were being shoveled off the conveyor belt as fast as they could be made with little to no thought. Initially I rated this as a five, but after a bit more thought I had to scale it back. I know this film is not supposed to be any sort of masterpiece and you need to watch it for what it is, but it is wrong for movies to be treated as lackadaisically as this. I mean, high school students can write movie scripts as simple as this. The addition of the killings following urban legends did add a little uniqueness to this film, but just a small amount. Although, instead of that quick fix, perhaps they should have made a better movie with better dialogue and done something outside of a cookie-cutter formula. If you're looking for a stupid movie that you don't need to think about and follows the Scream formula, this is probably one of the better ones (excluding Scream, of course).

Indeed it is almost like a hilarious screamer, but with less funny bits. It has the familiar story of a bunch of pretty (ugly) teens (30 somethings) being hunted down by a cloaked killer with some sort of vendetta. The main character is our lovely innocent heroine, but who is trying to kill her? Her boyfriend? Her crazy room mate? Her boyfriend's freakshow friend? The spooky teacher who just happens to be Freddy Kruegger? The petrol pump guy? Her best friend? The bin man? The Fonz? A ghost? Bin Laden? The slut? The jock? The nerd? The Greaser? The head master? The campus cop? Someone else? Some Thing else? Who knows? The killer seems to kill his victims in a way that recalls spooky stories we tell as infants, known in America as Urban Legends for some reason. For example. A babysitter is phoned by a spooky man who says 'I'm going to eat your babies!' She hangs up and phones the police to say a weirdo has been phoning her. The police phone back to say that the caller is phoning from inside her own house! She tries to escape but is eaten by a bear. Ironically, the babies have also been eaten. Such is the way the killer kills in this film, except he/she/it uses and axe and a microwave. I wish they had used my favourite Urban Legend- A couple are driving at night and listening to the radio. An emergency news broadcast is broadcast about a local maniac escaping from a local asylum, and is believed to be local. The couple are also local. The man needs a dump so he decides to go into a nearby house. The girl is scared but has a gun, so waits in the car, in the dark, in the rain. She turns on the radio only to hear What A Wonderful World. The sheer awfulness of the song makes her implode. Meanwhile the husband has entered a nearby house. He thinks it is a bit strange that the residents keep cocking their eyes to and fro and cooing at him, but is busting so much he goes for his dump anyway. Afterwards he opens the toilet door and finds he is stuck up a tree. Terrified he almost falls, but hangs from the branch. He realises that the pressure on his bowels made him hallucinate and that the house was really a nest, and it's occupants were pigeons. Just as he wonders if pigeons live in nests, a lighthouse which had recently collapsed on a nearby mountain rolls over the top of them, crushing them all. The car has been watching all this closely and decides to drive home by itself. On the way it sees a hitchhiker. He picks him up. Of course the hitchhiker is the local maniac. The maniac sees the girl's wrecked corpse and cries as he was the one who should have murdered her. Suddenly, the man and the woman leap up from the back seat and eat the maniac's brains, shouting 'We only pretended!' five times. On the fifth time they all vanish and several years later are found inside a mirror.That is my favourite story. Why it wasn't used I'll never know.Best Scene When the killer chases the girl into a room of barbed wire, cuts off her leg with a pair of hedge clippers, puts a firework into the stump, lights it, and she flies up into the air exploding, and the sparks spell out the message 'I'm coming for you next, Sydney!'

I'm definitely one experiencing a major nostalgia for the '90s, especially the late '90s. In addition to that, I had never seen this film before, and it features two actresses I happen to like, Alicia Witt and Danielle Harris (even though Danielle's character is short lived). The acting wasn't terrible in it, but I was never really scared by this film, so points deducted there. I was, however and quite embarrassingly, stumped as to who was offing all of the people. I liked the homage to Halloween at the end with all of the dead bodies popping up inside the abandoned residence hall as the heroine comes to the aid of someone she thinks is a friend in need, when Alicia's character finds her best friend laid out on a bed in the all too familiar image that Jamie Lee Curtis saw in Halloween, and when the killer is blasted out of a top story window by someone shooting him/her out the window. And one more homage the dead dog (killing a dog via microwave...innovative...but yuck...just in there for some shock value). The acting wasn't terrible, although I just couldn't stand Josh Jackson. He was okay in the Mighty Ducks films, but when it came to this film...uh-uh. What was with his bleached hair? Was he even thinking? Points deducted for that. Alicia Witt did a decent job of playing the heroine. And my hat goes off to the legendary Brad Dourif, playing Michael McDonnell the creepy but innocent stu-stu-stu-stuttering g-g-g-g-g-gasss st-sta-sta-station at-t-t-tendant, Someone's in the back...SEAT!.

The story isn't bulking with originality but the premise is pretty strong and interesting. After a brilliant opening scene ( the best in the whole wave of films) the film soon falls into a formulaic horror pattern, leaving the viewers disappointed and bored at times. Don't get me wrong, there are some thrilling slashing-scenes and fans of Scream ( like myself) will certainly get a kick out of it. There are a lot of plot holes but who cares about that as long as you get a scare out of it. The purpose of these films is nothing more than that so in that object it succeeds.The acting is above average for a horror film, despite the horrible Tara Reid, who has yet to produce one decent acting achievement. Joshua Jackson , Jared Leto and Alicia Witt ( who we can also admire alongside Mr. Pacino in the recent 88 Minutes) steal the show. Joshua Jackson is a perfect fit for his role and we can almost see the joy jump from the scream in his scenes. He has a really fun part to play and does so with a lot of liveliness. Keep your eyes open for the hilarious subtle Dawson's Creek gag.To conclude If you're looking for a thrill-ride and don't mind some plot holes, if you were a fan of Scream and I know what you did...it's a must-see. Probably the third best of the 2n slashers generation.If you're looking for something more than some thrills, avoid it. I'd recommend you rent the fantastic Zodiac. If you're a horror fan with high standards I suggest '1408'.C.

A journalist and his female friend try to dig deeper into the story.Despite being labelled as another Scream Rip Off, Urban Legends became one of the more successful ones and spawned 2 lackluster sequels, one being released straight to video titled Bloody Mary. This is a personal favourite actually even though I know that many people hate this movie. See, this didn't just have a masked killer, it actually tried to do something creative and have the killer base his murders on urban legends which, according to me, was an absolutely brilliant and original twist which made this flick stand out among all the slasher flicks that were released at the same time. Most people have probably seen this slasher so I figured that I really didn't have to describe the story too much. This is definitely one of my fave modern day slasher flick but I guess you've all ready figured that out. I love teen slasher flicks so it was a shame that the sequel for this flick became responsible for the death of the slasher wave along with the cool and sexy chick slasher Valentine. I can't see why some slasher fans don't like these high budget slasher flicks because I think that even though they are very mainstream, most of them are still very entertaining. If you still haven't seen Urban Legends, I definitely recommend you to check it out because this is one slasher flick that you should not miss!The acting I found was good, such as Jared Leto (Paul) does good, he acts well in teen films and other projects such as Fight Club and Girl Interrupted. Alica Witt (Nat)does OK as the female lead, Rebecca Gayheart was also great as Nat's best friend finally getting a chance to shine unlike her five minutes of screen time in her other slasher flick Scream 2. Joshua Jackson (Damon) shows up long enough to slap a few laughs in the flick and Tara Reid (Sasha) to show her ample cleavage bobble has she runs. We also get Danielle Harris (Tosh) acting like a beeyatch, having sex with too much makeup, Robert Englund (William) acting till the next Freddy sequel and Loretta Devine (Reese) was also great in her role.All in all, underrated by critics by labelling this as another Scream rip-off, the critics never took the time to realize that this has an original idea by using Urban Legends.

Urban Legend is a teen-age moviegoer's dream. It has familiar young television stars, familiar older stars with cult followings (Robert Englund as the aforementioned professor, John Neville as the dean), an edgy sense of humor, a tricky plot and characters too genre-savvy for their own good. Maybe there will be an over saturation of Scream-inspired horror films someday soon, but this one feels fresh. Someone at Pendleton University, the fictional safest college in the United States, is committing murders in the style of contemporary urban folk tales. There's an ax murderer lurking in the back seat of a car, a boy hanged in the secluded spot where he and a girl were parked, a killer on the telephone calling from within the victim's house, even a pet in a microwave. Alicia Witt (Zoey, the smart-mouthed daughter on CBS's Cybill) is Natalie, whose biggest problem at the beginning of the film is her creepy Goth roommate's active sex life. Rebecca Gayheart, of Scream 2, is Natalie's best friend, Brenda. Jared Leto (Claire Danes' dream guy on ABC's My So-Called Life) is Paul, the blue-eyed student reporter whom both girls are attracted to. Joshua Jackson (Pacey of the WB's Dawson's Creek) is everybody's pal Damon. Loretta Devine, from Waiting to Exhale, plays the only admirable adult, a campus security officer who likes to practice her pistol-firing stance while watching Pam Grier movies. Audiences may guess the identity of the killer, although clues point in several different directions toward the end of the film, but the original motive is skillfully hidden until the last minute. Appropriately, the final encounters take place on a dark and stormy night (although the rain stops mysteriously just long enough for Natalie and Brenda to run, terrified, through the woods for a few minutes). One clue to keep in mind in the chilly Northeast, lots of people own parkas with fur-lined hoods. "},{"Title":"Not good or bad...

The amount of teenager packed, pop culture filled horror movies that have been released in its wake is astonishing. Movies such as I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend are a direct response to the above movies success. Each involves fantastic looking people being killed one by one by an unknown executioner. They manage to include sex, comedy and popular music and the audience are subjected to clich√© scenarios and inevitable twists and turns. It would be so very easy to just dismiss them all as redundant, money making exercises, but to be honest, when they're done well they are thoroughly entertaining despite the obvious plot holes, unrealistic acting and overuse of cheap scares. Urban Legend is a very good case in point.When students at a fictional university are being slaughtered one by one, it becomes apparent that the killer is using common urban legends to take each of them out. The movie starts with a young woman having her head cut off by someone that had been hiding in the backseat of her car. It's a very effective scene utilizing a story most viewers would have been told at some point, with great camera angles, a thunderstorm to create the appropriate atmosphere and a suitably creepy Brad Dourif whom makes it work. You know what you're in for from this point onwards and while not all the scenarios work as well as this opening they are all reasonably well done. Over the course of the film, the creators manage to make just about every single member of the cast appear to be the assassin. A combination of red herrings and coincidences regularly come into play to confuse and sidetrack. I must admit that the first time I saw the film I had no idea who the killer was until it was revealed, which is a credit to the cast and crew involved.Urban Legend, as is the case with many modern horror films, doesn't take itself too seriously. There are clich√©s all over the place which I guess can be excused considering the theme of the film. It's a little difficult to make things seem fresh when most of the film is actually attempting to clone other well known stories. There are a few too many cheap scares for my liking. You know the ones! A girl walks into a dark library and thinks she's alone. She walks slowly around saying hello, is anyone there? Then she backs down a corridor only to wander straight into an innocent bystander while the music raises several decibels in an attempt to make the audience jump. Repeat several times throughout the movie and it just becomes really predictable. I guess directors of these horror movies that contain so much comedy really find it hard to build up creepy atmosphere so they simply have to resort to regular little shocks. The movie isn't excessively gory, yet it does include decapitations with axes, people being run over with cars and hangings. There's actually not a lot of blood and most damage occurs slightly off screen. It's also worth noting that a couple of horror legends get some screen time during all the fun. Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger) and the previously mentioned Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) are welcome inclusions.Overall I'd have to say Urban Legend is an entertaining horror movie with a really great premise. Pretty much none of it is believable (the killer seems to be in two places at once several times and the killer appears to be immortal by the end) but then it really doesn't try to be a serious and realistic film. Its purpose is to give you a fun night in, a few good jolts along with some awesome eye candy for both sexes. I believe it succeeds in exactly what it tries to do and therefore recommend it for those inclined. You know who you are.

The story works on a similar premise to the Scream films but is much darker. Maybe not the scariest horror film around but still highly enjoyable with a chilling menace throughout. Christopher Young's haunting score fits the atmosphere of the film perfectly, as does the lighting that the director uses. There are strong and entertaining performances all round, especially from Michael Rosenbaum and Rebecca Gayheart.Horror movie buffs might also find themselves looking at a few familiar faces. Robert Freddy Krueger Englund plays a creepy psychology professor. Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky in the Childsplay films, makes a brief appearance as the stuttering proprietor of a gas station. Finally Danielle Harris, Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4&5, plays Tosh, Natalie's goth roommate.The death scenes are gruesome and imaginative. The gore isn't OTT because the story is strong enough that it doesn't need to be - a couple of the death scenes are left up to the imagination of the viewer, which is perhaps even worse than actually seeing them. Finally, when the killer is revealed, the motive is interesting and there's a nice twist (or two) right at the end.Definitely worth either renting or buying if you're looking out for the best of 90's horror.

It's release was timed badly and resulted in it coming out at the same time two other teen-horror movie franchises were kicking off, Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer (You may have heard of them lol). Still, several years on and with the teen-slasher fad all but dead (check out Cry_Wolf if for some perverse reason you want to watch it's death throes P) Urban Legends stands up better to a repeat viewing than it's peers.Part of the reason for this is it's pacing. Although Urban Legend is smart and sassy enough to punch at the same weight as Scream, I'll cover that later. Urban Legend is paced in a similar fashion to the early slashers from the 80s, with a high bodycount, large cast (who are noticeably less numerous by the end ).) and very little time spent on overbearing witticisms. It's fast, it's punchy and it's one of those films that you enjoy enough that you don't really feel the time passing.It helps that it's also funny and self-deprecating without it getting in the way of the movie. Instead of setting up a 'and here's the funny...' scene like Scream does, Urban Legend builds it into the plot, saving valuable time for horror. In fact, a lot of the humour in the film is built into the horror sequences, again drawing on the movies of the 80s, especially the latter half of the Friday the 13th series.All well and good, it sounds fantastic, so why the 7 and not a 9 or 10? Well, despite all its advantages it is still a 90s style teen horror, and with that come all the genre stereotypes, dumb dialogue peppered with 'dude' and all the popular actors from sitcoms/teen dramas that you can muster. It isn't as achingly and offputtingly hip as the Scream series or I Know What You Did Last Summer (C'mon, Sarah Michelle Gellar and the Love-Hewitt at the same time? That's just plain wrong lol) but it is still a little overbearingly 'down wid da kids'.Anyhow, the fact is I still like Urban Legend and can see myself enjoying it for quite some time, whereas the need to rewatch Scream hasn't exactly gnawed away at me to be honest. It's the kind of movie that despite obvious shortcomings is enough pure simple fun that you'll keep it in mind over other films, and that's something I can say of very few movies. Oh, not to mention it has a good sequel to boot.

This film had its fair number of killings ,some pretty graphic and some not so graphic.The scene with the little dog was a bit too graphic for my taste and unnecessary in my opinion but that is only a minor quibble. Alicia Witt is a good solid heroine and the supporting cast does well.Joshua Jackson,from Dawsons Creek,is impressive though he is only in it for a short while before he is routinely dispatched by the killer. Robert Englund puts in a good performance as a teacher of urban legend folklore and it was nice to see him in a role that didn't involve him killing teens in their dreams. This may not be a purists type of horror movie but for someone like me who enjoys sitting down in front of a decent slasher movie it is a pretty decent flick.

There are some very talented actors contributing to this movie as well. I love being scared and this film is short of sudden thrills and jumps. It does keep you guessing as well you always look for the most unlikely person as the killer and your never right in all scary films that i have come across and Urban Legends is no exceptance.

Alicia Witt is good as our leading victim and Jared Leto as her love interest. Rebecca Gayheart does a nice turn as Witt's best friend. Tara Reid, Joshua Jackson, and Michael Rosenbaum make for some funny, if some what cheesy characters.

Natalie (Alicia Witt), a co-ed with a dark secret, realizes that the killer is mainly targeting her while a greedy reporter (Jared Leto) rallies to discover who is behind the costume.my thoughts In 1978, a slasher film called HALLOWEEN had so much success that it started a chain reaction of slasher films about a masked killer stalking a group of teens. One of those was Friday THE 13TH, which also had a chain reaction of a killer stalking teenagers in a camp setting.This happened again in the next decade. SCREAM had so much success that it started a series of slasher films where everyone is a suspect, one of those was I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, which was equally as successful. The first to come after the great SCREAM and the fun but unoriginal I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was URBAN LEGEND. Now when I first saw the preview to URBAN LEGEND, I was young and unaware of the 'SCREAM generation' and I figured it was a supernatural thriller about urban legends coming to life in a supernatural way (I have yet to see URBAN LEGENDS BLOODY MARY, but it seems to do that). But when I saw it on video, it was definitely inspired by SCREAM. Instead of using pop culture references like in SCREAM, URBAN LEGEND uses urban legend (duh) references. We even get grisly murders inspired by those legends.Being a slasher film, the murders are the most mentionable. I won't give them all away but they use some pretty cool ones, including the one where that girl is driving and someone is in the back seat (a great scene) and the one that ends with the words Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the lights? painted in blood on the wall. The rest of the murders are cool too, but mostly suggested. But even though it's not shown, that microwave scene was pretty disturbing.This also sports a fun cast. Alicia Witt (AMERICAN GIRL) actually didn't do so well because she seemed too gloomy and unenthusiastic. But Jared Leto is great as the greedy reporter (kind of like Courtney Cox in SCREAM), Rebecca Gayheart (SCREAM 2, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 3) is pretty good as the best friend with scary eyes, Michael Rosenbaum (tv's SMALLVILLE, CURSED) has great screen presence, Loretta Devine (also in the sequel URBAN LEGENDS FINAL CUT) is funny as the Pam Grier-loving cop who takes a beating and survives (kind of like Dewey in SCREAM), Tara Reid (AMERICAN PIE, THE CROW WICKED PRAYER) plays the usual blonde bimbo to a T and Robert Englund (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series) is creepy as usual. This also has quite the supporting cast with Joshua Jackson, Natasha Gregson Wagner and Danielle Harris.The director, Jamie Blanks, also knows a thing or two about directing a film. It is very stylish with great strobe light-like murder scenes. Christopher Young also gives us a creepy and subtle score which worked for the mood of the film.So if you love those typical slashers only with a big cast and some good style, definitely check out URBAN LEGEND!

This movie should probably be somehow horrific but I would put it in the same category as for example Scary Movie.First of all, the murderer is absolutely not human, since she always knows where the victims go, and on top of all that, her timing is also perfect. In the middle of the movie it starts bothering since she's always waiting in the bushes or waiting in the garage or whatever. Of course it's possible that she followed the victims all the time, but It's a wonder if they didn't notice anyone following them. In the end, when the cop shoots the murderer in the chest making her fall out of the window from the second floor, she remains alive, and without any bigger trouble she goes hiding on the backseat of the car. But when she falls from a bridge to the water, she suddenly dies (?). I'd call it pretty unrealistic.Second of all, how is it possible that so many characters are wearing/own the same coat as the murderer. Of course it brings along the excitement but still, in my opinion, is very poor. And when the massacre was mentioned, what does it got to do with the professor being let to keep his job if he shuts his mouth? Maybe It's just me being stupid but I don't think the idea was brought up very clearly.The last clitch would be the whole plot. I don't know if it was the same girl who killed all the people on the campus, but before she even knew that Natalie (or whatever her name was) was responsible for the death of her ex-boyfriend, she had already killed 3 or more people. So, was she doing it just for fun or what's the real deal? Obviously, as you can see, I didn't like the movie very much. The directing, special effects etc. were above average but the story itself was a fiasco.

There is an anonymous killer on campus who is knocking off students and basing the kills on modern urban legends, which are basically the stuff you hear about in horror movies or from someone who knows someone you know, you get the drift? Examplesthreatening phone calls coming from inside the house, an assailant hiding in the backseat of your car, a cry over the radio for help from a woman who is actually being killed... The premise is superb and very original and some of the cameos were great(Robert Englund Freddy, Brad Douriff Chucky, Robert Wagner's daughter... hehehehe). The radio station scene with a then-unknown Tara Reid is definitely one of the highlights of this film, and the unveiling of the killer at the end is kind of surprising...Most of the time I would enjoy this more than the Scream trilogy because when the day is long and I feel like chillin' out with some popcorn and a movie then 'Urban Legend' is worth the hour and a half because it is not very involving and I don't feel exhausted by the time the credits roll. However it does insult your intelligence sometimes like in the scene where Tara Reid's character narrowly escapes certain death and then runs into a nearby elevator when she could have just ran out of the front doors to safety. Also, there is a questionable scene in the beginning where a woman gets decapitated while driving a car and the killer miraculously survives and is even unharmed. But those are minor drawbacks which are present in almost every B-movie slasher. Still most of the viewing audience will probably discard this and consider it a trashy Scream rip-off, but for most of us die hard slasher-fans Urban Legend will eventually join the ranks with the best of them. It's definitely not better than the Scream trilogy, but it's worthy of a viewing. I rate it 6/10. Avoid the sequel, unless your a fan of Eva Mendes.

I would say Urban Legend is one of these. The film starts well with a good idea, a killer on the loose basing their murders on Urban Legends, and there just happens to be a course about Urban Legends being taught on Campus. Maybe it's just N.America, but do these modules actually exist?The film progresses, we meet a large cast, any of whom could be the killer, until the few survivors remain. The idea of the Urban Legend soon fades though, and the killer is just another psycho with a vendetta. Some of the deaths are good, others are awful- note to those in peril from masked murderer- if you don't want to die, don't sit in the corner crying, and covering your head with your hands. The film is full of today's, or yesterday's newcomers, some show talent, others are just supposedly pretty faces. Leto is good, Harris gets a rubbish role, but gives a good performance, and Gayheart does some terrifyingly bad over-acting.

Natalie's best friend? Yes, that girl. Ooh yes! Her name's Brenda! So anyway, Urban Legend is definitely better than its sequel...but it doesn't say much, because Final Cut is one hell of a bad movie. But that's not the point. I think what I'm getting at here is...how many times does Scream need to be remade until Hollywood is satisfied? I Know What You Did Last Summer is silly enough; do we need crap like Urban Legend and its stupid little sequel? I don't think so.Urban Legend not only has an incredibly hilarious plot, it has some hilarious acting to boot. But let's talk about its plot first. So some psycho college kid decides to go on a killing rampage (sp?) based on urban legends. That's great, really, but the next time someone does that again, please give him/her a believable motive, because the one provided by this movie made me laugh. I wouldn't spoil it for anyone, so I'll just leave it at that.The acting. Okay, Jared Leto, like I said before, is fine, as always. Ever since My So-Called Life I've been wanting to see more of this gorgeous and talented young man, and I think he was the best thing out of this mess that's called Urban Legend. My only real gripe (sp) I have with its cast is that girl who played Brenda. She annoys me. From her very first scene until her last, I kept waiting for her to die so that I don't have to look at her annoying face and hear her annoying voice and watch her annoyingly over-act. (spoilers) Who would've thought SHE was the killer? That came as a surprise to me, I'll grant you that, but why her? Why couldn't she be one of the victims? Why couldn't she take, oh, Joshua Jackson's place? Why did the film-makers have to put me through the agony of watching her??Another one is Tara Reid. She was okay, until her death scene. Her version of fear is really laughable; I've never seen fear being so badly acted out. The way she tried to convince the audience she's really scared is so pathetic, I found myself wishing the killer would get it over with and just chuck that axe into her.Urban Legend is really not that scary. Or rather, it's not scary, period. Unless you're really bored and like Jared Leto or Josh Jackson, don't see this. You'd want to bash your TV in if you do.2 out of 10, one for Jared, one for Josh.

While Halloween will never be an all-time great film -- its appeal is distinctly limited, after all -- it did become the standard for slasher films, combining gratuitous gore with a high level of suspense and terror.  The fact that Halloween still remains a scary film today for new viewers is a testament to its enduring strength. Then came Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street -- both good, scary films, although not in the same realm as Halloween -- and then came a horde of other forgettable sequels and series, each one worse than its predecessor, until the slasher genre had degenerated into a unmitigated pile of utter crap.Then, nearly twenty years later, Scream arrived in the theaters, and the slasher genre was reborn, arising out of the ashes like a reborn phoenix. A new cycle had started.Then came I Know What You Did Last Summer, which pushed this new cycle onto the downward spiral towards the toilet.And now, we've arrived at Urban Legend.  The toilet.Still want to know what this awful film is about?  Fine.  A psychotic killer is re-enacting a slew of urban legends, myths about killers and murders that seem to be whispered lore in high schools and colleges all across America.  The killer in question is stalking the young, attractive co-eds of a college campus.  In a half-hearted nod to Scream, the co-eds are smart enough to recognize the urban legends and realize that they comprise the killer's modus operandi . . . but not smart enough to use that knowledge to keep themselves from getting killed.  Lots of blood, gore, and co-ed sex ensues before the killer's identity is finally  revealed.As a fan of the horror genre, and as a fan of slasher films, I don't have particularly high expectations for a slasher film.  I expect to see one or two imaginatively engineered death scenes, I expect to jump out of my chair in surprise/shock at least once, I expect one or two characters to have some funny, sarcastic lines spread out through the film for comic relief, and I expect maybe one gratuitous, well-shot sex scene between the Handsome Jock and the Pretty Troubled Girl.  That's it.  Yes, that's formulaic beyond nearly all belief, but that's also the formula for a decent slasher film.Well, Urban Legend lives up to none of these expectations.  The direction is dull and plodding, the scenes produce no sense of fear or tension, and the gore is uninspired.  All the big `surprises' can be seen coming from a mile away.  Considering there's actually a promising set-up with the use of urban legends as the catalyst for the death scenes, this is incredibly disappointing.  (Ooh, the killer's got . . . a butcher's knife.  Gee, that's original.) There's also the obligatory scenes of one character tapping another on the shoulder at what's supposed to be a tense moment, the character trapped in the darkness with nothing but a flashlight, the killer sprinting past the unwitting characters in the background as they helplessly moan about their plight . . . unfortunately, these scenes are so ineptly scripted, and shot with such lifeless direction, they don't serve any purpose except to make you check your watch more than the movie (or TV) screen.  It's typical, ordinary, obligatory scenes like these that can be tweaked into something special into the better-than-average slasher film -- but in Urban Legend, these scenes are only typical and ordinary at best. At worst, they stink.  And they usually stink in Urban Legend.The cast is undeniably good-looking, but apart from that, they also don't do very much of interest, apart from either brooding, whining,  pouting, asking incredibly stupid questions, having sex, or getting butchered like sheep. Sidebar  the three main female leads; namely Natalie (Alicia Witt), Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart), and Michelle (Natasha Gregson Wagner), are completely interchangeable in this film.  You will easily confuse their names throughout the film -- indeed, you will easily confuse THEM throughout the film, because they are all the same character.  The producers of this film could've saved some cash by only hiring one of these actresses, and by having that one actress perform some extended monologues.  Absolutely nothing about Urban Legend is scary, interesting, or for that matter, worth watching.Not even a brief appearance by Robert Freddy Krueger Englund is able to resuscitate this rotten, insipid waste of film.  Avoid Urban Legend (and its sequels . . . shudder) at all costs.

Many characters are given (very) brief roles and (very) small personalities. Then they are killed. Like they are just teenage meat that are killed for our pleasure. I thought Hollywood had stopped making conveyor belt movie like this, but obviously not.When will filmmakers realize that horror films should be surreal, elaborate, scary, daring and manipulative?

Brad Dourif is a horror veteran first of all ( the voice of Chucky ) but further more he is a great actor ( Mississippi Burning, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ) but what really makes the beginning work is not so much who is in it, but how it is directed.There is true terror in the beginning.  There are false scares and then just when you think the person is safe, WHAMMO, she gets it.  That is what the rest of the movie is missing.  There is no real suspense.  And that is what made horror films so popular in the 70's and 80's.  You can talk about classics like Psycho and Halloween but you can even go into mindless, quickie films like The Prey, Pieces, The Forest and any other 80's film that we saw as teens.  They are really not that good, but what they did is they scared you.  Horror directors emulated what they knew from guys like Polanski and Carpenter.  They had an icon to look up to and even if their films left quickly, at least they scared us as teens on video in the basement on a Saturday night.  This film is like every other recent film ( with the exception of Scream ) that has tried to be a horror film.  It just doesn't get it right.  There is no blurry image of the killer lurking ominously and imminently in the background.  There is no fancy camera work to make you think the killer is coming from one way and then all of a sudden just when you have no idea what is going to happen, someone gets a machete in the head and they roll down a flight of steps.What we have here is a bunch of good looking actors that are killed off one by one in ways that really didn't scare me.  They were actually laughable. And the other thing that really bothered me in the film is the identity of the killer.  There is no way that person could accomplish some of the feats they did.  They were not  The Undead  like Jason.  They were not dream characters like Freddy and they weren't as mentally unstable as Michael.The idea behind this film makes for an intriguing story, it's too bad that maybe Sean Cunningham or Steve Miner from the early 80's couldn't have done something with it.

The massive cast of characters, each person possibly the killer.  The surprise ending.  And so on and so on.Jared Leto's main character is a bland, arrogant doofus.

While talking, she finds out the true nature of Damon's advances and kicks him out, only to see him killed by a mysterious figure in a black hooded jacket. When she gets back, no one believes her, since he also has a convenient alibi for being away. As more people disappear around campus, Natalie and Paul find out that the killer is basing their crimes on urban legends, and that anyone can be behind the hooded mask.The Good News Back when this movie came out, the gimmick of using the deaths based on urban legends allowed for some pretty inventive and original kills. The dead boyfriend suspended over a fleeing car was an expected one, and one that you can see coming from a mile away, but several others are quite original. The sex/strangulation misidentification death is really cool, and the backseat driver decapitation is a great one to open a film on. That sex/strangulation death is my favorite, mainly because the circumstances needed to make it true are so astronomical in their probability that it simply becomes a nice surprise. To have the back-story needed to make sure Natalie couldn't see anything, the killer gaining access to the room without violent means, and the actual sounds of the incident are all mixed together and it makes a marvelous scene. The hanging car death is also masterfully excised to create some wonderful suspense scenes, as the killer is revealed in the early part of the movie, and does away with a likable character, Damon, right away. Their ensuing chase of Natalie adds extra juice as they try repeatedly to break into the car, setting off the events that lead to Damon's death. Only one non-death scene was really effective for me to prove an old urban legend, two woman stand in front of a building and say Bloody Mary five times. From inside the building are the ghostly screams of supposed dead souls from an old massacre twenty-five years past. Gasping in shock, they back away, only to bump into someone. A cheap gag, but the effect worked because it comes from the unexpected source. It isn't the screaming ghosts, but the bump afterward that gets the scare. Also of note is the identity of the killer and how their secret is kept is some great writing. The way there are so many different red herrings involved, and all of them given good alibis to clear them, so by gaining more clues to their identity, it broadens the suspense by making a extra clue for the people to solve. One great scene, where Natalie watches someone in the killers know attire stalk one of her friends in a swimming pool, while she is helplessly trying to get her attention. A great little suspense scene that mainly works because we know what the killer is dressed like, but its effective.The Bad News The main problem with this film is that it was aimed for the masses to consume, so it has a lot of toned-down gore. Many of these killings should've been a gorier, and it will probably disappoint the many out there looking for a good gory slasher film. It also falls into the realm of those post-Scream films, where they're trying to poke fun of the genre at the same time as trying to scare you, and here is one example that people can point to as having a ton of cheap scares that aren't frightening. What makes it worse is that many of the jokes aren't funny, so it is a bit flat in some places. Also, two of the murders aren't based on urban legends being dragged by a car onto the tire spikes in several buildings, and being chopped up by an ax. Not real urban legends, so it has a false title. One last thing this scene is so stupid I have to comment on it. After surviving a vicious car crash, Natalie rolls down the car's window and opens the locked door to get out. The window was already down; you didn't need to open the door! That's just letting the killer catch up to you.The Final Verdict While certainly not for everyone, this is a far better flick than its reputation would have it. It has some fresh kills, a couple nice suspense scenes, and a new gimmick at the time. Slasher fans will want to give it an open-minded look, but post-Scream horror film haters will think a little harder than others will.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, some alcohol use, a scene with a dog drinking and a brief mild sex scene "},{"Title":"Even after 7 years this movie is still a classic to see.....","Date":"27 September 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" This movie is just as good if not better than scream.

The plot has an interesting premise and the movie starts very well with a suspenseful sequence that's well built and executed! Brad Dourif is fantastic and his presence is a big bonus and a pleasure for the horror fans and especially Chucky freaks as I am! Freddy Kruger himself, Robert Englund is also on the cast even if he is wasted in an empty, paper character! Very nice to see him too! However these appearances while pleasant are also cruel since it reminds us of original, frightening and cool horror, something Urban Legend is not!The cast is filled with somewhat famous young actors! It's funny to see how today still no one has really exploded into stardom! Alicia Witt has what it takes to be the heroin, good looks, innocence and strong screams She carries the movie with no apparent difficulty! Rebecca Gayheart unfortunately overacts to the point where her acting turns ridiculous! Not convincing, too over the top, too bad! Tara Reid, a real pleasure to the eyes, has an easy drop dead character! No talent needed!Again, it's a shame the director didn't take more advantage of the beauty of his female cast! Jared Leto is way too good for his weak character but he pulls it off with class! Joshua Jackson has charisma and lights up the screen with his brief appearance! Michael Rosenbaum is perfect for his role and the veteran John Neville is very amusing with a strong presence on screen! Loretta Devine is the only real miscast! She's annoying, irritating and manages to ruin every scene she's in! God, what a bad, uninteresting performance! Oh the pain!The music is horrible, with really high notes and no personality!  The director has nice moments with some interesting shots and he achieves good levels of tension in some key moments in the movie! Good cinematography too!The script however is dull, formulaic and lazy! There's nothing remotely original in it! The characters are walking clich√©s. The Urban Legend idea is appealing but then we fall on a boring death spree with nothing happening in between but a laughable investigation that leads nowhere!   Every clich√© in horror movies is used! We have the killer chasing the hot girl sequence, people not believing the main character, the boyfriend being a big suspect and so much more that I cant say without going into spoilers! And the ending is just so stupid, illogical but at the same time predictable it's just sad! There's not the smallest effort in the story! And of course there¬¥s the giant plot holes that after a while you just stop caring about!Urban legend is a politically correct teen slasher, with nothing new and no real reason to exist! Its not exciting, it doesn't have the smallest reality feel to it and it's almost an embarrassment to the true horror fans! Not even the deaths are cool! Its not scary, it's not sexy, it's just a pathetic attempt at being entertaining! A mediocre copy!

Having watched TV since the knowledge of the On/Off button of the TV-set there are not that many movies exciting me and surely this one is not eliciting the slightest extrasystolic stroke of my heart.Hollywood movies, are what they are. They devour money like a hungry bear and the outcome is the same as the worthless bear¬¥s.Now a small dissection of the movies anatomy.The Surface After examining everything for a while you come to the conclusion that that the plot outline is the same as many others you have seen before, or just a mixture of them. ( Scream, Helloween, The Simpsons...)The Character study There are dummy-characters, you know they gonna die during the next half an hour ( let¬¥s title them canonfodder ). They are normaly either timid or crazy or easygoers. Then you need characters to distract the moviegoers from the real evil guy. Two types of them the really suspicious ones ( often hunchbacked, one-eyed, three-legged or whatever -->let¬¥s classify them as cheap-suspects) and the more decent ones ( they always seem to be your best friend--- In 95 % of the Hollywood movies the real murderer is hidden in this group ). Then you need one or two main characters ( normally hero and heroine ), who will survive anything in 99 % of the cases. Furthermore you need some assholes ( doing always the obvious WRONG thing, but still persisting that they are right-- In 50% of the cases they will meet their doom ) and a lot of happy people around.The Inner Parts 1. Why for god¬¥s sake everybody in that movie wore the same overcoat ? Megasale or what ? 2. Why would someone go to a swimmingpool, dressed like an  Eskimo, just to take the coat of near the bassin ? 3. Why a murderer is always near you, all the same if you are in the desert coincidently, ran for ten hours into the wilderness in whatever direction, closed fifty doors behind you and when you take a rest the murderer is already there. A rabbit and hedgehog paradoxon ? Teleportation ? A case for Stephen Hawking ...? 4.If you call someone, no one will answer you, but instead sneak towards you, put his hand on your shoulder and frighten you to death. Maybe I should treat my friends like this too. 5.Instead of defense, move towards the corner of a room sit down and cry Oh, dear evil person please don¬¥t kill me Effect a 100% dead sure. 6.Being a woman, eating two bullets, falling down at least five meters to the ground, opening a car and hiding there ( of course  after you have taken your axe with you ) for let¬¥s say an hour ( still bleeding !) until your last burstout of energy, which will bring you into the most fortunate situation of falling down again 20 meters from a bridge ...Wow what a spectacular death for such an evil woman !! 7.In almost every horror movie during the climax-phase there have to be a thunderstorm, and when it happen that you urgently call the police, they tell you, that they are all out. Why ? Why everyone ? What may be the reason for it ? Coordinating the traffic ? Saving kittens from a sure thunderbolt-death in the trees ? A murder is normally not that important. But I believe, this the special time for all murderers to commit their crime and therefore chances are bad to find a free policeman in an emergency. Yeah, I believe so. Especially if all Hollywood movies show you, that it is the best time, it must be the best time. 7.If you here faint sounds of sirens, that means the evil person is dead and you are rescued, at least for that sequel (... but at last... strange ?!...police?.. here ? Thought they were somewhere else in mission ?)

Ten years later everybody's ripping off Saw and now the teenage crowd is flocking to see torture porn at the cineplex. Movies like Scream made the late nineties kids feel trendy while these newer films make them feel both trendy AND hardcore.Films like Urban Legend are now (mostly) a thing of the past, so I decided that maybe now is the time to go back and see what I missed the first time around and my conclusion is that the thirty-year old Bill owes the teenage Bill an apology. This movie is a complete waste of time and a total piece of crap!Slow and stupid is a phrase that perfectly describes both this film and all the characters in it.

"},{"Title":"Urban Legend Should Keep Horror Movie Junkies Squirming.","Date":"8 February 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" The fun of watching creepy slasher movies is to see how many clich√©s the films can trash without trivializing the conventions of the horror genre. Alfred Hitchcock launched this dreadful but adrenalin-laced genre back in the 1960s with Psycho. Halloween, Friday the 13th, and the Nightmare on Elm Street epics along with their sanguinary sequels carved out a cinematic niche for themselves in the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer sagas have pumped fresh plasma into the slasher genre for the 1990s.As axe-wielding, serial-killer, whodunits rate, Urban Legend takes its cues from Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and features more than enough get-up and gore. Sadly, lacking a credible plot, Urban Legend adds only a creative stab or two, but never twists the formula enough to distinguish itself. Ultimately, the film relies on the usual quota of clich√©s, shocks, and cleverly staged homicides to conceal its flaws. Conspicuously missing are the lusty interludes that punctuated Halloween and Friday the 13th. Sexual activity is confined to the Kama Sutra sex chat of a late-night, campus talk-radio host, and an Elvira coed who reams out her roommate for walking in on her during sex with her guy. Unlike earlier slashers, Urban Legend doesn't punish its participants for their carnal urges. Thrill-thriving teens, may salvage a shriek or two, but veteran, old school horror-goers will scoff at the less than legendary treatment that the filmmakers afford their promising premise.Rookie film director Jamie Blanks and novice scribe Silvio Norta had a novel idea. An anonymous homicidal maniac is killing students, faculty, and administrators at Pendleton University, a prestigious New England campus. What sets these killings apart from ordinary homicides is that each slaying reenacts an urban legend. Urban legends are contemporary folklore spread by word-of-mouth that contain a modicum of truth. Alligators prowling the sewers of Manhattan and metal tooth fillings that transmit radio broadcasts exemplify urban legends.Scenarist Silvio Norta's predictable but abrasive 'cry wolf' screenplay paints paranoid college student Natalie (Alicia Witt of TV's Cybill) into a deadly corner. She keeps warning everybody about the serial killer but everybody ignores her. Paul (Jared Leto of The Thin Red Line), a scoop-hungry journalism major, refuses to believe that urban legends would inspire a murderer. Meanwhile, frat boy Parker (Michael Rosenbaum of Poolhall Junkies) exploits Pendleton University's own urban legend. Twenty-five years ago an insane professor slashed the throats of several undergraduates in their dorm. Parker commemorates this heinous occasion with a party. When Paul sees the truth in Natalie's 'cry wolf' stories, the campus security chief (Loretta Divine of Dreamgirls) reminds them that The U.S. News & World Report named Pendleton as the safest campus in New England.Urban Legend sticks closely to the horror formula in most respects. Urban legends like the babysitter who gets harassing phone calls from within her house, axe-murderers waiting in the back seat, and trying to get the car cranked before the lunatic smashes the windshield are skillfully woven into the fabric of the plot. Just about everything spooky happens at night, and everybody has a nasty habit of sneaking up on each other. The killer walks, while the victims run! Not only does Natalie have a tough time convincing her friends about her serial killer, but the filmmakers also have their own problems convincing us that their murderer could commit such crimes.Blanks and Norta imitate rather than renovate the classics. Looking like Nanook of the North, the villain wears an ominous but nondescript fur-lined parka. The serial killer is literally faceless because the hood obscures all facial features. Wisely, the filmmakers have complicated the identity crisis. Just about everybody in Urban Legend sports an identical parka. Unhappily, their efforts to distract audiences with red herrings about the murderer's identity misfire.Urban Legend opens with an exciting scene set at a back roads gas station on a stormy evening. A college student, Michelle Mancini (Natasha Gregson of Lost Highway) runs out of fuel. At the gas station, a stuttering attendant (Brad Dourif of Dune) who intends her no harm scares Michelle. As she spins her wheels to get away, the poor guy warns her about a person with an axe in the backseat. Indisputably, Urban Legend qualifies as both mischievous and mean spirited. The vicious killer wields a razor-sharp axe and enjoys swinging the bloody thing.Director Jamie Blanks choreographs each killing for maximum visual and aural impact. He doesn't really do anything innovative that previous horror directors haven't already done. He gets more mileage out of shocking than scaring. At least five times, he uses the old trick of having somebody grab someone else from off-camera. When he can neither shock nor scare, he resorts to sadism, like the dog in the microwave. Altogether, Blanks is a competent enough technician who never lets the momentum lag in Urban Legend. A capable but unknown cast bolsters the mystery. None have gained a reputation for portraying villains so the baddie is more difficult to spot. Sadly, these characters are too sketchy and stereotypical to win our sympathy. Robert Englund of Freddie Krueger notoriety raises a few hackles as a suspicious folklore professor with a closet of grisly weapons. Waiting to Exhale's Loretta Devine excels. She is cast against the grain as Pendleton University's Security Chief. The scene where she practices her gun-wielding speech to an old Pam Grier movies is cute. Nobody can say that Urban Legend doesn't smash racial stereotypes. Apart from its bizarre premise, Urban Legend spouts none of the ironic humor that highlighted the Scream movies.Urban Legend boasts a few surprises, and villain's slide show explanation for murder seems obligatory. Of course, the film leaves itself wide open for a sequel as the antagonist survives several gunshots and a night-time plunge into a deep, icy river. Nevertheless, Urban Legend should keep horror movie junkies squirming until the next slasher movie unspools.

Brad Dourif (Child's Play) as the gas station attendant, Robert Englund (Nightmare on Elm Street) as the suspected murderer, Joshua Jackson (Dawsons Creek) as the corky horny teenager, Tara Reid(American Pie) as the sexy radio host, and The lovely Rebecca Gayheart(Dead Like Me) as the raging serial Urban Legend murderer. Miss Gayheart's beauty can only be surpasses by her madness in this new-aged Urban slasher flick. I highly suggest seeing this climactic theatrical masterpiece.

Most of the slashers of this time weren't great, but this one was one of the better ones. The film centers around college students who have been passing around urban legends. Natalie, a student, begins to suspect that a trail of murders are all linked to urban legends. As the anniversary of a supposed series of murders that took place on campus nears, some of the frat boys are throwing a party to have some fun... but as the mysterious killer closes in on Natalie and her friends, people begin to die one by one.I like this movie because it uses hints and clues to the killer's identity, although it doesn't really give it away. I was really surprised when I discovered who the killer was. The actors are all pretty good, and we also get horror veteran Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare On Elm Street) as a folklore professor, and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky in the Child's Play films) as a strange gas station attendant. Another thing I'd like to mention was the killer's mask. Well it wasn't really a mask, it was a fur hooded parka and the hood was so large that you can't see the face of the person - it's just a black hole. I thought it was kind of original. There are many instances in this film were major flaws and clich√©s are present, but overall you have to take the film for what it is, and put those aside to be entertained by it. Overall, I'd recommend this movie to all horror buffs, but don't waste your time with the sequels unless you're really interested - this one is much better.

As the murders continue fingers point at everyone.One of the many bad things about Scream was that it made studios start making teen slashers again.  Some were OK and many were terrible &#150; in fact Scream 2 and 3 mostly fall in the latter category.  Here this starts with an interesting premise &#150; that all the murders are carried out to mirror urban myths.  This creates interest despite the fact that the cast are all irritating teens and the gore and scares are low.However halfway through the killer starts&#133;well&#133;just killing people, and not always in the line of a myth.  This loses the principle, and although it tries to get it back, it's has become another slasher with a gimmick movie.  This evens fills the screen with so many red-herrings that the whole cinema smelt of fish.  Right from the very start we are given a cameo by Brad Dourif who then goes missing and so on&#133;..literally everyone could be the killer.  How original!!!Happily the film manages to show that it has it's tongue in it's cheek &#150; and this saves it.  For example the casting of Englund shows a use of post-modern wit, as does other in jokes such as a car stereo playing the Dawson's Creek theme music.  Unfortunately bits like this are few and far between and the film kills it's way to a typically silly twisty conclusion.The cast are all beautiful people &#150; the out-of-glossy-magazine look!

One hippy-like guy says, You know...maybe we could do something with contemporary folklore...you know, urban legends...and somehow relate that to a psychotic killer that kills based on these urban legends.  Another listener says, Sure, we can make it at a college campus...that lets us use a lot of actors and actresses with great looks and hot bods...and little talent or expense.  Still another adds, Yeah, we can get that Robert Englund guy...you know Freddy...if he is still around and make him a red herring(alright I doubt they know what this means, but play along)as to who the real killer is.  Such, sadly, is the basis for the film Urban Legend.  It is a very VERY typical slasher film from the 80's and 90's style...a mad serial killer kills every nubile teen within miles at a college based on urban legends.  A girl has her head axed off, a man has his dog microwaved, a woman is brutally killed while another girl doesn't turn the lights on, and so on.  At the end of the film, the script-writers try to convince us that their story has some logic and reason, but they were never farther from the truth.  The plot of this film is ridiculous, implausable, derivative, and inane.  The actors are all pretty boys and girls with little(and in many cases) no talent whatsoever.  They are nice to look at(especially Tara Reid), but that really is not...or should not...be the basis for a film.  There are some older veteran actors like John Neville as a somewhat smarthy dean of the college, Robert Englund(doing a pretty good job I might add) as a professor teaching a whole class on contemporary folklore(?), Brad Dourif in a cameo, and a real nice, although incredibly silly, performance by Loretta Devine as a security guard who wants to be like her idol Pam Grier.  The killer isn't too hard to guess...I was going a bit without assurance, but in the end the final veiling and resolution are so ludicrous as to make you no longer care.  The film fortunately doesn't take itself too seriously...neither did I.  Not bad for mindless entertainment.

For example, critiquing Scarface or Goodfellas for use of excessive violence or profane language would generally be a pretty silly thing to do. They're not family movies, and they're not targeted at children. The same typically goes for horror films (or films from any genre, for that matter). Who are most of the horror movies geared towards? Teenagers. And let's be frank the majority of teenagers don't give a hoot about quality. Guys take their girlfriends to see horror movies for obvious reasons; the girlfriends generally scream out loud at the screen and try to warn characters not to do certain things (Don't go in there, girl!). They don't really care if the movie is comprised of laughable dialogue unless they're picky filmgoers -- like me.I hate horror movies.Not all of them. I respect when they're done well (e.g. Psycho or even Halloween), but the tiresome reign of repetitive sequels and clich√©d storylines have gotten very old very fast. Urban Legend is basically just another Halloween knock-off; there's a serial killer going around scaring people and jumping out at the screen. But oh, how Halloween was masterfully crafted, and Urban Legend is...well...not.This one has a twist it's about a serial killer who mimics urban legends. You know, those old stories that always contain hidden morals. I've recently become familiar with most of them via snopes.com -- the babysitter who finds out the killer is upstairs/downstairs in her own house/the house next door. The woman whose car is pursued by a crazy driver, only for her to find out that the driver was trying to warn her of a serial killer lurking in the back of her vehicle.I'll admit that this could have made a splendid, quite original horror film -- but Urban Legend resorts to clich√©s of the worst kind. Filmed in the era of self-aware victims (e.g. Scream), Urban Legend's characters are aware of the old myths that they are being confronted with. Too bad all of them are too stupid to avoid them. (If a killer were running around campus murdering people in a ritualistic fashion, would you ever wander into an empty dorm room located within an empty college? If you just said, Yes, then you're as stupid as the characters in Urban Legend.)Busty, ditzy female heroines are always so damned stupid that it makes me yearn for a heroine as smart as Sarah Connor or Laurie Strode. And don't get me started on the heroes! Freddie Prinze, Jr., anyone? Ryan Philippe? And now, Jared Leto? Puh-lease. Who's next Joshua Jackson? Oh, wait...never mind.Considering how idiotic and naive the recent heroes and heroines have become in the horror genre, it makes me wonder (and fear) what will appear ten years from now. Yes, every once and a while the delightful horror film comes along that is surprisingly good (Signs, The Ring, The Sixth Sense, etc.). Urban Legend is not one of them.P.S. Note the cameo by Robert Englund, a.ka. Freddy Krueger. His efforts at self-parody are completely wasted here.1.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer "}{"Title":"A Failure","Date":"22 March 2004","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Ah yes urban legends a folklore story that is supposedly true .

Like many of the best slasher films, this one has a method to its murders, and that method takes form of the fascinating idea of urban legends. The plot is your basic slasher fare, with a bunch of dumb, but good looking, college kids finding out that there's a killer on campus. Only this killer doesn't kill people any old how, they're all dispatched in the style of the aforementioned urban legends - and includes such ideas as a wet dog being dried in a microwave, and the classic 'kidney heist'. The film is quite annoying, however, as it delivers it's best sequence right at the start and never manages to top, or even match it's opening - which is hugely disappointing.It has to be said that the murders in this film are mostly very well put together, and it's obvious that director Jamie Blanks (who also directed the rubbish 'Valentine') was more interested in the murder scenes than most of the rest of the film - which is fine considering what type of film it is. There's enough suspense generated to keep the audience interested (even though the target audience is the same bunch of moronic teens that star in the film), and there's also a big part of the film dedicated to the idea of red herrings, and just about every single character comes under suspicion at one point. The only problem with this is that while the script is busy making us think that the murderer is any number of characters - it becomes obvious in the end as there is only one person that hasn't come under suspicion yet. The cast is dotted out with a bunch of young actors; along with performances from eighties horror 'icons' Robert Englund and Brad Dourif. It all boils down to a satisfying silly conclusion, and while this is hardly great horror; it's certainly not bad.

Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt) is studying at Pendleton University, after attending Professor Wexler's (Robert Englund) mythology class she lets the annoying Damon (Joshua Jackson) take her out in his car. Unfortunately his motives are of a sexual variety which Natalie doesn't take too kindly to, he steps out of the car to take a whizz when Natalie is attacked by a duffel coated maniac who has murdered Damon. No-one believes her & her friends try to convince her it's Damon playing a practical joke but when her roommate Tosh (Danielle Harris) supposedly commits suicide Natalie knows something sinister is going on, she becomes increasingly irrational as she thinks the killer is after her...This American & French co-production was directed by Jamie Blanks & I happen to think it's maybe the best post Scream (1996) slasher that tries to ride on the success of Wes Craven's flick & the sudden return to popularity of the 80's slasher flick. The script by Silvio Horta which is played pretty straight has the neat gimmick of basing it's on screen kills around urban legends although some of them clearly aren't based on any such thing, the slitting of Natalie's roommates wrists for instance. I thought it was a pretty neat hook which makes Urban Legends stand out just that bit more than the usual slasher, I thought the teenage cast of character's were better than usual as well with a fairly likable set of protagonists. The dialogue is alright, there's a couple of decent red herrings in here to try & confuse you & the inevitable twist ending is rather good without being too predictable. So it's all good news so far but Urban Legends isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination as it's perhaps ten or fifteen minutes too long & there's an absolutely scandalous lack of blood, violence, gore, naked chicks & exploitation. In fact I'd go as far as to say Urban Legends is one of the driest & tamest slashers out there which isn't good as it could have used a couple of really big gory set-piece kills, then again nothings perfect I suppose.Director Blanks does OK, the film has a very elegant & professional look about it. While it's not the most stylish or flashy film ever it's always nice to look at. There's a nice enough atmosphere to the whole thing, the stalk & slash scenes generate some tension on occasion & it tries to throw in a few genuine scares as well. Urban Legends is one of the few films I have on DVD which I actually bothered to listen to the director's commentary & I have to report that the lack of blood & gore was entirely intentional on the filmmakers part. In fact Blanks says there wasn't even a special make-up effects artist on set at any time, I simply don't understand why you would want to make a slasher film & totally ignore the boob & blood potential as surely that's what any fan of the genre is looking for, right? Anyway, forget about any gore as there really isn't any apart from a few after-the-fact dead bodies & an exploded dog in a microwave. The only real disappointing aspect of the film.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 Urban Legends is well made with good production values & has that Hollywood polish about it, this was actually shot at the University of Toronto in Canada. The acting is pretty good, the cast look nice enough both the boys & girls although I'm only really interested the ladies. You know, I hate Dawson's Creek (1998 - 2003) so I was absolutely delighted to see Josuha Jackson not only get killed but killed very, very early on. Tara Reid is suitably attractive enough as the films main looker.Urban Legends may only be another dull slasher to some & if I'm totally honest that's exactly what it is I actually rather liked it, sure the lack of blood & boobs don't help but there was something here that I liked & enjoyed. Followed by two sequels, Urban Legends Final Cut (2000) & the straight-to-video Urban Legends Bloody Mary (2005).

One of the most annoying trends in cinema ever, since these clones and rip-off's merely are dreadfully uninspired excuses to show attractive girls screaming. Every once and a while, a reasonable effort comes out of this (like `Cherry Falls' or `Final Destination') but the majority are just a waste of time (`I know what you did last Summer', `Bloody Murder' &#133;). Urban Legend also surely belongs in this last category, although it could have been better. The idea of mixing urban legends into a horror tale to itself is far from bad, yet the execution is downright lousy! Perhaps it would have been better if they focused on a slightly more solid script, but then again&#133;perhaps not! We'll never know and, frankly, I don't want to. Fact is that this piece of junk only has one good moment, near the beginning, with a small (uncredited) role of Brad Dourif. Hardly worth a viewing, is it? Urban Legend isn't gory at all and there's no nudity (at least the 80's slashers showed some ravishing meat) so why would you even consider watching it? I'm sure you got better things to do than seeing how the careers of former `Beverly Hills 90210' and `Dawson's Creek' stars evolve in the wrong direction?   "}]
