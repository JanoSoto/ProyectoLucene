The jury is still out on how much of the autobiographical details of the life of Chopper read are real and how much is fake... but it does make a compelling story either way. Eric Bana gives a great performance in the lead... nothing else I've ever seen him in prepared me for how good he really is. The character he plays is nasty, repellent, scary, ill-tempered... and still full of charisma. After a violent stint in prison (his motto appears to be do unto others before they do it unto you) Chopper is sent back out into society. With no other skills besides his knowledge of crime, Chopper offers himself to the local police as a special undercover agent. They, of course, want nothing to do with his boneheaded scheme but he pretends that they do anyway. Inflicting pain (on himself *and* others) seems to be what he is best at and he gets plenty of opportunities to show his stuff. Amusing though it may be at times, the movie is not a glorification of violence... the ferocity and suddenness of it keeps the audience constantly on edge.

Chopper is an amazing piece of filmmaking in nearly every regard and goes beyond the limitations of vernaculars.  I had to laugh at the review that dismissed it as sophomoric tripe and attempts supporting his argument citing the film's lack of realism in violence.  Although based on a real man this is storytelling cinema not documentary.  There is an obvious element of gross exaggeration in most of the scenes of violence in Chopper, which serve a purpose (or, more specifically, several purposes).  Chopper is obviously incapable of telling the truth &#150; or even hearing the truth. It is, at first, difficult to figure out why so many are drawn to Chopper (and not at all difficult to see why so many wish him dead).   Within the first few moments Eric Bana establishes Chopper's character in a way that reveals the off kilter charisma that some simply cannot resist.  Those Chopper seems to get along with best are those on the periphery, those who don't invest too much whom he seems intent on impressing.  Those too involved with him are locked into his doom because simply no one is able to keep up with the mythological figure Chopper has created himself (or tries create himself) into.  Darkly humorous, brutal, yet not without pathos the film rightly focuses on its central character and lives up to the unlikely hero's motto never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn.  Chopper is a fascinating film filled several amazing performances even in smaller roles (e.g., Jimmy's chain smoking, junkie, white trash, pregnant fianc√©e stumbling to the floor to pick up a sawed off shot gun in the hallway). Not for everyone, but those who get this sort of thing will be richly rewarded.

Andrew Dominik, the director, did a splendid job.  The film seems so realistic, the brutality, the dialogues, the places, the characters, it's all so well adapted to the kind of movie that Chopper is.  The acting is really amazing, especially from Eric Bana, who plays Chopper.  This man has the talent to make every single feeling of his character visible, and realistic.  The violence, while being pretty graphic and brutal, isn't gratuitous or exaggerated (except for some scenes with too much blood letting).  The violence hits the viewer, just like he was feeling the pain, it's very well reproduced.  The character of Chopper is interesting, as a man who's trying to be a real tough criminal, but still has some feelings...it's Natural Born Killers with nuances...With funny moments, great acting, nicely-written scenario and one very interesting character, Chopper delivers that Dark humor, attaching characters, great scenario, violence (for the people who like it), and it's a very nice movie.  Eric Bana has a lot of future in acting...and Andrew Dominik is a great director that should definitely continue in this business.  Chopper is very enjoyable.  I give it 8/10.

The film is still great!","Date":"6 April 2006","Score":"27 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Mark Brandon Read, nicknamed Chopper, was a notorious criminal in Australia who after spending most of his life in prison, went on publishing books with anecdotes of those years becoming a successful writer of Best-Sellers. While he has been accused of exaggerating things about his life in his books, the stories presented still are realistic and shocking, and give insight about the mind of this complex and often-troubled man, regardless if if they are real or fiction. Chopper, the movie, is not based exactly on Read's life, but in the series of anecdotes he wrote in his first books.Eric Bana plays Chopper and gives one of his best performances to date, capturing the very essence of the living legend Chopper has become now. It is not a surprise that this film gave him recognition out of Australia and turned him into an international star. but even when the movie is centered around Chopper, Simon Lyndon and Kate Beahan's performances shine in their roles as Chopper's cell mate Jimmy and Chopper's girlfriend Tanya respectively.Like Read's books, the movie is not exactly a biography, but a collection of tales surrounding the now-mythical figure of Chopper, presented in a way that perfectly mixes strange surrealism with harsh realism. The gritty semi-documentary look the film has enhances this feeling as well as the cold way the violence is presented. Like the real Chopper, the film walks the fine line between fact and fiction, and that's what makes it very appealing and interesting.It could be said that Director Andrew Dominik painted an accurate portrait of Chopper the legend, not of the real person; and that's probably what the real Chopper may prefer. Domink plays with the moods, going from serious drama to awkwardly funny scenes in this character study that presents us a charming yet dangerous man, who probably has been through more than what we would like to do, yet less than what he would likes us to believe.The film is very intense and tough, and very good at it; Bana is perfect as Chopper and shows great promise as an actor. His characterization makes very difficult to don't like this common man with a very uncommon life. Director Dominik makes a straight-to-the-face film that stays true to Chopper's persona (fictional or not), and does it without being pretentious or manipulative. It basically lets Chopper's charisma speak for itself playing with the audience's fascination with crime and violence.If as flaw was to be found, it would be that it never tries to go beyond its goal or push too much the envelope. It is not much of a flaw, as the results are still brilliant, but leaves one wondering at how far could it had gone considering the talent of those involved. Anyways, Eric Bana and Andrew Dominik are set to a bright future and this film is a brilliant start for these two new talents. 7/10 "},{"Title":"A well directed and written film with a balanced view and a great performance from Bana","Date":"16 May 2004","Score":"30 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Mark Brandon Read, aka Chopper, is a small-time criminal who is violent and unpredictable. During one of his many stays in prison he is betrayed by his friend Jimmy &#150; who stabs him repeatedly in an effort to kill him for a bounty. When Jimmy fails, he claims Chopper attacked him and Chopper does the time while Jimmy gets free. Released years later Chopper leaves prison still his jovial, friendly, brutal, violent and unpredictable self.In this review I will not even bother getting into a debate over whether or not it is right or not to make a bigger celebrity of Chopper than he already is &#150; the book is out, the film is made and it's a moot point. The film does a good job of being reasonably balanced &#150; it shows Chopper's action in such a light that it is hard not to be disgusted by him and his sheer disregard for human life. There is of course an element of the film liking him, but in fairness that may be the truth &#150; he may have been the nice bloke at heart that the film presents him as; most of us will know people from clubs and pubs who are salt of the earth and will call you 'mate' all the time until they take offence at any little thing then they'll be fighting before you know it. The film is amusing and shocking in equal turns and manages to be engaging even if the plot is more of a character study than a plot.In this regard it really works, because the film captures a great deal of his character and not just his actions &#150; he must be a horror to know and it is this that stops it really glamorising him. The script is really well done and it allows us to feel a strong fear and dislike for this man without ever being turned off him to the point that we stop watching or stop being interesting. Bana is a big part of this and he is really good in one of his earliest roles on film. He manages to make this man both a monster and charming in a blokey sort of way, but he also brings out the inner fear and loneliness that Chopper has &#150; and the sheer basic immaturity that drives him.This is not glamorisation, this is a fair look at a man who few of us would want to ever meet. The support cast are also good but it is Bana's film and he shows why Hollywood picked him up in the first place.Director Dominik may be a little taken by his subject, but he makes it balanced and actually presents a character rather than just a hyperkenitic comedy killer that Chopper could have become in someone else's hands. Certainly if this had been a Hollywood film it would have made Chopper much more of an anti-hero and would have dropped the character a bit in favour of stuff that targets the Tarantino teenage 'killer-cool' audience. He does add a great deal of style as well and there are plenty of scenes here that are fun and stylishly directed &#150; however his biggest contribution is bringing out the bad side of Chopper rather than just making him a killer who is funny.Overall I wasn't sure what to expect from this &#150; I'm not generally morbid or interested in people who are just thugs, even well known thugs, but I did enjoy this film. The direction is cool and stylish but the script brings out a Chopper who is unpredictable, childish, lonely, insecure and brutally violent &#150; if you met him in a pub you would run if you had any sense. Bana takes this and gives a great performance to keep him charming but never hide the fact that he is a dangerous and thoroughly unpleasant man.

I thoroughly dislike being asked to identify with murderers and criminals and to treat organised criminals as anti-heroes. With this in mind I was quite surprised to find that I really enjoyed Chopper.As previous reviewers have said, this is essentially a character study rather than a story. The reason it works so well is that Mark Brandon Read is a compelling character beautifully impersonated by Eric Bana. Anyone who's ever seen an interview with Read himself can appreciate what a close impersonation Bana achieves; his sudden guffawing laugh and light-hearted way of talking about his really unpleasant deeds being perfectly copied. The movie manages to do what I'm sure Read himself has achieved in real life - it tricks you into liking him before revealing that his hair-trigger temper and propensity for paranoia and violence make him a dangerous person to be around. The thing that keeps you watching is Chopper's jovial nature but also his unpredictability. In circumstances where other gangsters would have gone on a killing spree, Chopper just shrugs and takes it in his stride. But likewise, in throughly innocuous circumstances, his paranoia can kick in at any moment and send him on a violent outburst.

No, he was not the handsome, dashing Aussie fellow that American females have been drooling over since his role as Prince Hector in the cheese-filled film Troy, but instead he showed us that he really can act and take on a very difficult role and do it with real grace.

That, in and of itself, it quite impressive. I've always been a fan of the demented and dark comedies, and love movies like Pulp Fiction, but Chopper takes the cake. This movie has all the comedic violence of Pulp Fiction, but portrays it in a grittier and more subtle way.

After seeing him as Mark Read in CHOPPER I was totally struck by something - Eric Bana is gonna be a megastar very soon Watching CHOPPER is somewhat like watching the young Deniro in TAXI DRIVER Bana`s performance more than makes up for the flaws in the movie , he`s not an actor playing a character - He is that character , he is Mark  Chopper  Read . Chopper puts on weight so Bana puts on weight , and I`m loathe to ask what Bana did in order to er ... how can I put it , that scene in the bar ! Did Mr Bana get a surgical extension ?

One thing`s for sure but - His bestsellers can`t be half as bad as anything JK Rowling has scribbled . I also liked the poem sequence at the end though I guess just as many people will loathe it as like it I do admire the producers honesty in pointing out that much of this screenplay is invented and I do wish more producers would do this , a pity that those of us such as myself who had never heard of Chopper Read have no idea what bits are true and what bits are fiction though . I guess that the way Chopper is written and played our sympathies should go out to him though we can`t condone what he`s done in life . I found it difficult to sympathise with this violent nutter myself but I guess anyone who asks Who did you f*** while I was inside ?  only to be met with the reply Everyone . I work in a brothel don`t I ?  can`t actually be responsible for much of their own actions . Indeed Chopper is painted as a sad pathetic idiot though thankfully not as some type of victim So I found CHOPPER to be violently disturbing and laugh out funny in equal measure , just like the first time I saw TAXI DRIVER .

The fact that the character's exploits have made him a best-selling author is nothing new. Such material has been presented to us twice already by Scorsese (Taxi Driver, King of Comedy). The icy, blue depiction of ironically performed acts of bloody horror dates back at least to Cronenberg's Dead Ringers.

Chopper doesn't quite work out as a biography or even a character study, but it's an intriguing document on violence and violent people, and about what makes the same people land in trouble again and again.On top of that, it's also pretty entertaining. Eric Bana is terrific in the lead. Not being from Australia myself, I first became aware of Bana as a leading man in American mainstream films like Troy and Hulk, where he always struck me as dull and uncharismatic, but finding out that he was a successful comedian is his native country first makes a lot of sense after seeing his disturbing, layered and very funny performance as Chopper.

There's a scene where he is shanked by his confidant, and continues appearing to be in no pain at all. His lack of concern is shocking. He looks down at blood pouring from his torso like someone else has been injured, and then up at his assailant as if conveying sorrow that it should've come to this. Then there's another scene where he shoots a drug dealer and then considerately drives him to the hospital.The movie, which I'm completely unsure it finds what it's looking for, is either 1) shrewd or 2) too eager to get to the prurient in not depicting an elucidation of Chopper's aggressive depravity. Regardless, it does give a hint in the way he's separate from criminal gangs and has no partners. He's not a gangster, if that word entails a line of work, but a brutal psychopath taken by impulsive frenzies. There is a surprising moment during a passing stint on the outside of prison, when he re-examines old hangouts and old friends and appears gracious and appeasing, until his rabid side lashes with unrestrained wrath. The earlier amiability was not a put-on to throw people off their guard. He actually was feeling welcoming, and did not essentially expect the blasts of rage out of the blue.How this initially shocking, then bleakly funny, then merely repetitive cult biopic uninflectingly illustrates its subject is as a row of disturbed emotional states and thought processes. Perhaps a clinical mood disorder case reared in a society not bound to notice or care, or equip him with the ability to do either himself, he's just seized by these agitated episodes flanked by comparatively normal behavior despite being a violent, oversexed criminal. Nevertheless, the rapid alternating, which is sometimes played for perverse laughs, or suspense, or surprise, though it's more fascinating portrayals occur near the beginning as mere exposition, sometimes leads to what is either delusion and hallucination on his part, or stylistic flourish by Dominik.I'm guessing the latter, though I enjoy Dominik's fascinating use of camera speeds in depicting the influence of cocaine, or the multiple perspectives of Chopper's shooting of a man and the intentions of both later on. But around the time of this shooting, there begins to set in an unforeseen sorrow that elevates this flashy cinematic drill, which, if nothing else for sure, is certainly a revelation of Bana's talent.

They're watching a programme about one of the three men; that man is Mark Brandon Read, an Australian made somewhat famous for his infamy and who goes by the nickname of Chopper. Eric Bana's steely gaze as the convict dominates the sequence, the film lingering on his expression in close up format as he himself remains locked on a TV programme detailing his very exploits. Through lingering on Read's expression, a sense of glee at his actions as one of his victims explains how the very onlooker once harmed him, the audience are invited to realise a viewpoint, or perspective, of the man; one from the point of view of a victim whilst systematically cutting to the guy for what he is, sitting there in the flesh and watching on. The film is more interested in the figure of Chopper than the news report, essentially setting up what Andrew Dominik 's 2000 film is all about the getting to know what made Chopper who he is away from all the television and the media opinions.The film is mostly all of one long flashback, one that'll begin in 1978 therefore allowing us to observe ourselves mostly everything that made Chopper who he is up to that point in prison, circa 1991. In introducing Chopper as a jail-dwelling; steely eyed; tattooed individual whom watches accounts of men he's maimed in the past on TV informing everyone of how bad/evil/nasty he is, the film sets up a pretty stone-wall image of the man during the early exchanges. What follows is a film that doesn't' excuse what Chopper did or what he is, but rather explores how he came about obtaining both his physical and media-driven image and aura. When the film has come full circle and we end up in the prison cell again, there's a moment one of the guards appears sad that the time has come for the TV report to conclude; both guards to leave and for the door to be slammed shut and locked. The guard looked sad, but there was an additional degree of acceptance in his face - Chopper Read may well be a funny, charismatic and involving guy but he's done what he's done in the past and that time which arrives that'll see the jail house door slam shut is a sad realisation that he's there as a result of his flaws more-so his enthusiasm for what he does.When the tale of who he is, why he is begins in Pentridge Prison in the late 1970s; the film waits for all of about five minutes to use this frightening and unhinged aura about the man it built up by way of all the talk in the opening. Chopper's a violent man and the film is accordingly so, with one of its more gruesome scenes playing out in the tough manner that it does because it's blood-letting and maiming which is self inflicted by way of a third party. Whilst not a direct action of one character on another, Chopper's drive to get out of the prison division he's in and get relocated sees him take measures that see him loose parts of both ears.Chopper is the sort of film that'll see a person stab another, several times whilst in prison, before have the pair of them sit down some years later in an apartment and just talk. Chopper's like that, there's a really odd atmosphere about it; a brooding sense that there'll be an emoting of anger just around the corner all put across by way of an odd blue tint that drowns out most other colours and emphasises the grime and the dark most locations possess. The film presents Chopper as a distinctive figure, whereas most of his prison inmates in the early scenes sport long hair and huge moustaches; Chopper doesn't have any of anything. His shaven head and minimal facial hair aid in our association with him as this alienated figure from everyone else, to the point it appears his own friendships have run aground. Chopper's physical appearance in his hard, muscular and tattoo-clad body further pushes him away from his fellow inmates as this tale of how a society; a culture; a nation eventually bordered on a kind of infatuation with the man.Just as Chopper's body is put through a wringer of stab wounds and ear mutilation, his mind goes through a similarly rough period of anguish. Once out of prison in the 1980s, and out with girlfriend Tanya (Beahan), he eyes a man named Neville (Colosimo) who he believes was seeing his partner during his time inside. The camera sticks with Chopper's face complete with stare, again in close up format, as a series of strobe lights flash across his face &#x96; a storm brewing on the inside, a series of explosions built on rage going off behind the steely face. The film will use the three primary colours of red, green and blue to blend together to create a spectrum of hate; threat and supposed forgiveness at various times; maintaining a blue tint throughout with, later on, a mini-bar at Neville's home being drowned out by some blood red lighting as further tempers fray and hatred reaches a peak. This, as Chopper's conversation with a former best friend-turned-betrayer and consequent enemy is covered in a green tint, suggesting calm or neutralness as they sit amidst drug infused squalor and talk uneasily. Chopper's an interesting film; a combining of smut and grot with some odd sequences of a post-modern sort channelling an aesthetic akin to something like 1996's Trainspotting. Dominik would later revisit this idea of studying a menace to society in his 2007 Jesse James film; but Chopper's detailing of a guy with a bizarrely attuned celebrity status plus violent streak is worth seeing by itself.

Bana in the title role completely owns this character and goes through a gaudy transformation, producing one of the most fascinating performances you will ever find. A performance that should be as legendary as the real life character in which it based on, is sadly overlooked and missed by many. A movie this low budget and this relatively unknown hinders the level of praise it will receive from fans and critics alike, but it's one that should be sought out by anyone with the least bit of interest because it doesn't disappoint. Bana gives the performance of the year and one of the best the decade has to offer. He truly captures the charisma of Read. He's also convincing when he puts a bullet in someone's knee or head, or stabs them to death and leaves them in a pool of their own blood. Completely driven by paranoia, jealousy and speed, Chopper corners himself into a room and finds a nice cozy spot all by himself. He's pitted against anyone and everyone, which is beautifully captured in the films final moments. Out of fear he's forced to kill or be killed. He has no friends, and the friends he does have attempt to kill him because of the dire circumstances he puts himself in. He has a sense of charm and infectious attitude that attract people to him when he's sober. He's seemingly incapable of murder, until he's struck the wrong way at the wrong time, then anything is possible. Whether it be the guards in the prison, the media, or the people of Australia, Mark Chopper Read is as fascinating as they come.Dominik really has shown to be extremely interested and captivated by the art of storytelling, and how fact and fiction can become blurred or distorted. We see multiple scenes where an event will unfold, then we'll hear Chopper tell the story of what happened, then we'll hear someone else tell the story in a completely different manner. One thing Chopper loved to do was tell a story. He loved to fascinate and make people laugh. Sometimes he had to bend the truth and make certain events a little more entertaining, or more intense, because that's what storytelling is Bending the truth and amplifying certain facts while downgrading, or disregarding others. This is way when Chopper tells Read's story the audience feels all the emotions he felt during that time. Dominik captures this beautifully. One great scene portrays Chopper getting stabbed by his own friend, and the pure shock that he felt by getting stabbed by his friend is illustrated in a way that's incredibly unusual and surprisingly hilarious. Like Chopper, we can find humor in some of the most odd and unexpected places. Chopper is one of the best films of the year, and Bana gives the performance of a lifetime.

Being based on Reads own writings the story does not follow a traditional arc, which is both a strength and a weakness.In my opinion the producers have gone a bit overboard with the bleak/grimy blue, green and red filters, and to me it becomes distracting rather than providing the mood intended.All in all Chopper is well worth the watch just to see how good Bana can be when he is actually challenged.

In fact, it is one of those movies that even though you know what is coming up, the scene itself is still very amusing.I am sure everybody in Australia knows who Uncle Chop Chop, or Mark 'Chopper' Brandon Reid is, but for those international people who don't believe that there is anything of relevance outside of their borders, he was basically a Melbourne standoverman who pretty much made a packet (legitimately) by writing a series of books while he was in prison. As he says in the movie, he is a best selling author, and he can't spell, so there are probably a bunch of university graduated English majors who are fuming. My thoughts are more power to him, particularly since what he writes about (and shame on me for not actually having read any of his books) are things that people actually want to read.The question really is whether the events in this movie are true or not. Well, to be honest with you, as Chopper says himself, the movie is 100% true and 100% rubbish. The one thing that crims, especially those like Chopper Read, is to take a true story and embellish it so much that nobody can actually use the story itself to prove that what actually happened is true or false. Mind you, most of the scenes in Pentridge (with maybe the exception of the stabbing murder of one of the Painters and Dockers leader) are probably true, namely because there are corroborative sources, but then most of those scenes do not implicate him in anything anyway. Still, the murder probably did happen as described, but then again we will never know.However, there are parts of this film that are not true to form. Granted, Bana plays his role brilliantly, right down to the fact that you can actually believe that he is some paranoid, drug crazed, standoverman, however Chopper actually took offence at the suggestion that he actually beat up women. To be honest, there are aspects of the criminal world that would not stand for that type of behaviour. They say that there is no honour among thieves, but that saying is actually as flawed as some of the stories in this film.As is suggested, Chopper never went after or assaulted an innocent person, and this is very much the case among the professional underworld. They are not interested in innocent people. Those who commit muggings and break and enters of random houses then to be young street kids, those that the professional underworld considers expendable. The professionals actually don't care about these people, namely because there are more important fish to fry when dealing with the underbelly of society. Mind you, while the criminal underworld intrudes into every aspect of our lives (you can be assured that the local pub is probably paying protection money to somebody) those of us who are not involved in it, probably don't need to worry about having some professional killer come gunning after you.

It was much funnier than the disappointing Wog Boy.

Alongside him are a great bunch of actors, a list in fact too long to mention. We follow Chopper, a few years before his release back in 86 (where he takes his share of knifings in the cell) to his next stint back in prison in the last ten minutes, when he has a big interview, such a show pony. His books have sold millions, his success an enigma. This unexpected comedy is a hoot all the way through, mostly on Chopper's part. The violence is very realistic, some of it, quite hard to take, the ear hacking scene, and the repeated stabbing of Chopper's arch enemy, Keith George. Chopper's story is one hell of a tale. The story is formulated brilliantly, and so is it's writing. The actor who plays Jimmy Lachnlan is great, and Vince Colosimo, isn't bad either, as Choppers ex friend, Neville Bartos, where him and Lachlan conspire to have him wasted, only it doesn't work out the way they wanted. Bana totally absorbs the character, one moment sane, the next, a full blown nutter, a performance he won't ever surpass. If as a tease, one shot, has the real chopper being escorted into a police car. A hell of a night's viewing of comedy, rent Chopper, although you might not find it in the comedy section of your local DVD outlet.

Bana is magnificent in this fierce and inglorious film","Date":"12 April 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Andrew Dominik writes and directs this film adapted from the semi-autobiographical books by Mark Brandon Read - nicknamed Chopper by the Melbourne underworld because of torture tactics he used to employ while interrogating and collecting money from drug dealers. Chopper is a dark, brutal and often times funny film about one of Australia's most notorious criminals. Read has since left his life of crime behind, and as the film states at the end, he is one of the best selling writers living in Australia at the moment (And I can't even spell!). Chopper Read himself recommended that Eric Bana be the actor to portray him... and what a choice he made. He couldn't have picked anyone better. Bana spent time with Read and gained loads of weight for this truly manic and searing performance. It's like nothing I've ever seen before... he is truly magnificent. The make-up for the transformation of Chopper from a young man in prison in 1976, to an older and bigger man in 1991, was amazing. Bana is unrecognisable because of this. The film begins in 1991 with Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read sitting in a small cell watching himself on TV talking to an interviewer about his life, and she interviews some of his old friends and enemies. The arrogant and cocky Read boastfully laughs and applauds himself, while the two guards watching it with him watch on in amusement. We then go back to the 1970's, at a maximum security prison, where a young Read is having an on-going feud with another inmate. Read brutally murders the man, and it isn't long before he has no friends in the prison, and a bounty is put on his head. His request for a transfer to a different part of the prison prove to be futile, but he cunningly hatches a disgusting and awful plan - he gets another prisoner to slice his ears off. This sets the atmosphere of the film to come... and we are then brought up to the 80's, when Chopper enjoys his freedom. The man is truly crazy... he states that he doesn't inflict pain on normal civilians... only scumbags and drug dealers. Which brings him back into the brutal Melbourne underworld, where he begins working with the police, who give him a 'green light' to exterminate scumbags.I never thought I would enjoy this movie. Probabably because I had seen a similar film called Bronson which I thought was a diabolical, self-absorbed and glamorous portrayal of a lunatic. However, watching Chopper, I realised that Bronson was a sorry wannabe. Chopper is superb... It's dark, brutal, often times violent and also quite funny. When I say that it is funny, I mean that Chopper himself is quite a character. Bana delivers many memorable one-liners. Chopper is funny, but he is a man I'm sure many people wouldn't want to meet. In the film, he is unpredictable. He could be talking all nice and calm to someone one minute, and the next minute he could have a gun drawn aimed at them. Dominik never attempts to glorify the man. All he does is attempts to add some humane aspect to him, which I'm sure, despite all his short-comings, he still had. Bana plays him well; in a role that inevitably got him to Hollywood later on. Chopper is a dark and disturbing film that wouldn't be suited for everyone, but if you enjoy films about psychopaths and gangs, then it's worth watching. From having his own ears sliced off to driving a drug dealer he shoots in the leg to the hospital (Which he denies doing later on) Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read is certainly an interesting and crazy character.

Mark Brandon Chopper Read was an Australian criminal who extorted money from other criminals, basically by being more dangerous and psychopathic than anyone else. He wrote a book detailing his life in the Melbourne criminal underground during one of his prison terms which became a massive bestseller in Australia. In fact, Read became the bestselling Australian author with his series of violent yet comedic books and when a film was to be made of his life, he recommended Bana play him, based on a recurring character Bana had been doing on his sketch show, an obnoxious macho ignoramus called Poita &#x96; yabbo-speak for Peter.The choice was inspired. Bana is magnetic playing the complex Read, witty yet terrifying, intelligent and sadistic. His behavior is so extreme and button-pushing, it really forces you to examine Western ideals of masculinity. Is Chopper admirable or horrifying? He is fearless and seemingly impervious to pain. At one point, he has another inmate cut his ears off in order to be transferred to another wing of the prison. He is a really funny and likable guy in a brash in your face sort of way. Yet he is a cold blooded killer who makes his living terrorizing other people, who just happen to be criminals, specializing in cutting their toes off to compel them to pay his extortion, or killing them outright. He justifies his behavior through his code &#x96; he claims he does not hurt civilians &#x96; only other crooks.Not for those with a weak stomach.

Eric Bana is utterly convincing as real-life standover man Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read, and he gained a substantial amount of weight in preparation for this role.There has been quite a bit of debate as to whether Read's numerous gruesome anecdotes are actually true; perhaps we will never know. But he never comes across as arrogant or as someone suffering from a severe case of narcissism. I was watching him in a documentary the other day entitled 'Fatbelly' which was very interesting. He is a charismatic man who does not glamourise or excuse the things he has done (or allegedly done). And he likes to paint! 'Chopper' is a very bloody affair but, like 'Goodfellas', the violence is contextual and never violence for the sake of violence. Chopper inhabits a dark and sleazy underworld peopled with shady characters such as weaselly junkie Jimmy Loughnan (Simon Lyndon) and gangster wannabe Neville Bartos (Vince Colosimo). As soon as the film begins, it is clear that we are in for a decidedly rough ride within the first ten minutes, Chopper - who is incarcerated at the beginning of the movie - launches a frenzied attack upon fellow prisoner Keithy George (David Field), stabbing him repeatedly in the neck.There are quite a few memorable scenes in this film. The aforementioned opening attack upon George is one; another sees Chopper have a fellow prison inmate hack off his ears with a razor blade so that he - Chopper - can get a transfer to another part of the jail. Upon release, Chopper pays a visit to Neville Bartos and extorts money from him. Later Chopper, his body covered with scars and prison tattoos, calls upon Jimmy Loughnan, who is living in squalor with his fianc√©e and young daughter. Chopper's avuncular approach to their daughter sends a chill down the spine. Looking around the filthy flat, Chopper remarks to Loughnan, 'Well, this is swank, mate. This is plush. Who says crime doesn't pay, eh?'. Then there is the shooting of Sammy the Turk (Serge Liistro) outside the Bojangles nightclub, for which Chopper gains a very odd, sick kind of fame when fans of his come from all over the world just to be photographed outside the notorious nightspot. And then there is the scene in a pub in which Chopper demonstrates a very to-the-point method of getting a desirable young woman's attention.'Chopper' is just another reason why Australian film is so great. It is up there with other dark and graphic Australian films such as 'Ghosts of the Civil Dead' (which also starred David Field) and 'Head On'. Andrew Dominik went on to make the brilliant 'The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford' with Brad Pitt as James and Casey Affleck as the socially inept but ambitious Ford. Like fellow Australian director Alex Proyas, Dominik has made the transition to Hollywood; both directors continue to excite and challenge. Check out 'Chopper', but only if you have a strong constitution.

It is funny, stylish, witty, well-acted, well scripted and very entertaining.It begins in a bleak Australian Prison (where I believe Chopper spent most of his 20's incarcerated) for abducting a judge. Here we are greeted by a youthful chopper minus the weight and the beard. We learn that he is just as troublesome in prison as he is outside. He continuously picks fights with other convicts and these other convicts normally belong to bigger and dangerous gangs. He is always wanting to prove that he is bigger and better and more dangerous than every one else. This culminates in Chopper stabbing another prisoner which in return turns choppers friends against him. The section following this based in the prison provides a delightfully funny and insightful look into the mind that is Chopper Read. We find out that he seen as a parasite and hated by the general prison population. But he has a friendship with the wardens and the governor. In this part we witness one of the events that leads up to Chopper slicing his own ears customizing his head forever. On the outside of prison we also get to see another side of Chopper that is quite alarming. He is constantly angry and is prone to violence on petty whims and this violence does not stop with drug dealers, but other loved ones in his life feel the full brute force of it too.Andrew Dominik's script and direction are superb and is one of the best from a first time director and writer. His experience before this involved music videos and certain scenes in this film reflected this. His handling of the violence brutally honest and at times very disturbing. However with his use of lights and crisp dialogue and stylish camera work we really get a good insight into Brandon Reads mind and we never leave that once the entire time we are watching this.Eric Bana was an actor that I had never heard of before I had seen this film. I have read that it was on Chopper Reads own advice that Bana was cast. Bana is fantastic in the role of Chopper he gives it his all and he is not afraid to love the flamboyancy of such a notorious real life character. He is also not afraid to give 100 percent to the violence at the start of the film. He really gets into the skin of the character and to separate Eric Bana from Brandon  Chopper  Read. He has many fine scenes and his is backed up by a fantastic supporting cast who also give 100% to their roles.Chopper is a great viewing for any one that has an interest in real life crime figures or just crime stories in general. It is not in the same vain as Scarface or Goodfellas but it is very entertaining and original. It is to be honest the kind of gritty and realistic film that I would expect from Australian film industry and it does not disappoint me.

Eric Bana takes hold of this role, as the real life Mark Chopper Read did with the Aussies' attention. The film begins with Read incarcerated for an attack on former friend Neville Bartos, played by the equally engaging Vince Colosimo. Moving back in time to his first prison stay, the character development of Chopper takes place through various relationships and violent encounters. What stays with us is the ironic guilt Chopper holds for his actions. Always remorseful, ever charming Mark Read commits acts of aggression against himself and others with an unusual penchant for humor. Whether with the flick of a pistol or the switch of a blade, Chopper moves through life with what he perhaps believes is control. All evidence would prove contrary as space only exists between his times in jail and not in-spite of them.Skewed and out-of-sorts, the film along with its main-character bounce through the tumultuous crime riddled years of his infamous career. Overwhelming at times the picture achieves success through following Read closely, revealing his nuances and tastes... which seem to end just beyond animal instinct. Though that's the Chopper Read you most certainly love to love! And we do love him. In a very up-front and honest way his character is precisely the type of criminal one would hope to know, if one had to know one. Forthright with his intentions we are never lead to think he wants anything out of life... excluding loyalty, and your money of course. Perhaps the only thing getting in the way of him being the nastiest of Australian thugs is his need to amuse those fans he has found by default. Ultimately leading to a best seller on the Down-Under book shelves, Read is refreshing in that he admits to all his crimes. Though he's only ever prosecuted for one of them.Chopper is a terrific film for the independent fan. Winner of the Sundance film festival, and catalyst for Bana's current popularity here in the US Chopper is at times too much for the average movie-goer... though if you're on the look for a movie in the way of Reservoir Dogs or any ultra-violent, black comedy then Chopper is for you.

Some focus is given to his popularity, perhaps another comment, by showing how his idiotic fans travel to the venue of his most notorious crime and pose with toy guns.Eric Bana's extraordinary performance in the title role keeps you watching but as the closing credits rolled, I knew no more about Chopper than I did at the opening titles.

Mark Brandon Chopper Read is a well-known, larger-than-life criminal/author who's roots in Melbourne's underworld scene go back to the 70's. Read's notoriety has long been legend in Australia, while his unlikely success as a best-selling author irks some who feel he has profited from the pain of others and the crimes he's committed. Yet his pithy crime-tales still sell like hot cakes. Read himself has often countered that the type of people he has inflicted his psychotic tendencies on in the past are the very people that the 'average' man and woman fear and loathe in the first place, fellow criminals, particularly drug dealers...Andrew Dominik has brought key events and moments from Read's 'career' to life in a stylish and entertaining way. The script is more 'case study' than a cohesive plot, but Dominik's understanding of the material allow's him to stitch together a series of scenes focusing on a genuinely psychologically complex person to produce a well-rounded view of Chopper, the man and the myth.Eric Bana has rightly been praised for his work in this film, and I honestly don't think he's done anything better subsequently, but to overlook the contributions of the support players would be to sell them way short; Vincent Colosimo is hilarious as high-rolling drug dealer Neville Bartos, Simon Lyndon excellent as shifty Jimmy Loughnan and Kenny Graham comes across oddly chilling as Read's father, with his humourless laugh. Skye Wansey steals all her scenes as heavily-pregnant and heavily dosed Mandy, she is the very definition of 'Bogan Moll' in her small but hilariously observed role.Dominik's stylistic touches are clever and not overdone, sickly colour washes dominate the Pentridge Prison scenes, whilst garish neons and orange filtered light permeate the nightclub scenes - Jimmy Loughnan's flat is a nightmare, lit with a nasty fluroescence... A number of IMDb reviewers have noted and appreciated the fact that the use of amphetimines was visually augmented with time-lapse photography, another neat trick ...Dominik's dialogue sparkles and is dead-on; his use of Prison Slang, Bogan-talk, Aussie colloquialisms and pitch black humour is clever and avoids cheap parody.Examples of the p iss funny dialogue Chopper  Beethoven had his critics too Keith, see if you can name three of themExamples of pitch black humour Choppers slightly over-ambitious plan to 'ice-pick the spines' of every inmate in his H divisionChopper head-butts his girlfriend Tanya's Mother, then chastises Tanya Have a look at what *you've* gone and done without a hint of ironyJimmy Loughnan asking smacked-out 'fiance' Mandy to put her little girl Shazzy to bed, and a half-unconscious Mandy irritably snaps but I don't wanna go to bed ! - Not *you* Tanya !! Chopper's nonchalant comment to the Prison Guards that Keithy seems to have done himself a bit of a mischief after they arrive to find inmate Keith George lying in a biiiig pool of blood.A reporter asks Chopper what exactly he 'likes' about cutting people's toes off - Choppers reply  'oh, I dunno, I just like the way they pop off' ....

There has long exsited a tangled relationship between fictional and actual crime, with real crooks basing their behavior on fiction at least as often as the other way around. The Australian film Chopper is particularly relevant to these issues, for it depicts a real-life criminal who has become a sort of twisted media personality Down Under by writing a series of bestsellers about his violent exploits. You could say that a movie like this is profoundly immoral in how it publicizes a scumbag like Chopper, who is said to have gained his nickname by cutting off his victims' toes. To the degree that the movie avoids this, it is due to the visual scheme and Eric Bana's performance as Chopper. Chopper makes Joe Pesci's psychotic GoodFella Tommy look like a model citizen. Bana was a stand-up comedian before being cast in the film, and he brings to the role a likable, jovial heartiness that makes Chopper's sudden shifts to savagery all the more chilling. Chopper often apologizes to his victims after attacking them, and the most bizarre- and funny- thing about his apologies is that they're sincere. In a prison scene, after mutilating another prisoner, he then tries to justify his actions to the man, who is lying on the floor in a puddle of blood. Later, when Chopper's best friend repeatedly stabs him in retaliation, he doesn't even react to the pain, and instead acts emotionally hurt by the betrayal. Not just Chopper himself, but the whole criminal subculture shown in the movie, is sleazy and repulsive, without a hint of glamor. Though the movie's sordid quality, paradoxically enough, is morally satisfying, it also isn't very entertaining. The director, Andrew Dominick, employs flashy visual tricks to effectively limited use, while filming most of the action in a restrained, austere style that reinforces the banality of the characters. Consequently, the movie starts to feel somewhat repetitive and dull. Dominick shows some talent, but in the end, it's Bana who carries the show.

It shows in unflinching detail why Mark is still one of Australia's most notorious criminals, as well as the fact that something is seriously wrong with Australia as a society. Australia likes to tell itself that it is the greatest country on Earth, and every citizen has everything they need. The mere existence of Mark Brandon Read, as well as the confirmable facts of his life story, is a direct slap in the face to people who buy this myth.Kudos are also due director Andrew Dominik. A lesser director would have portrayed Read in more glowing terms for fear of angering the man himself, but this film elevates itself by sticking to the facts between certain birthdays that occurred and can be verified, portraying them with an objective viewpoint. The film is neither pro-Chopper nor anti-Chopper. It is just, as the title indicates, Chopper.The film covers three distinct periods in Read's lifetime. The first is one of his early incarcerations as a young man. Here, a gang war turns nasty when Chopper kills a rival in the daily power struggles that constitute prison life. Anyone who thinks that Quentin Tarantino has a clue about depicting violence of any kind, leave alone an ear-removal, would be well-advised to catch this section of the film. The accuracy with which stab wounds and impromptu amputations are depicted is really quite frightening. The second part of the film depicts Chopper on the outside, and it is interesting to see how just because he doesn't live behind bars anymore doesn't mean he doesn't behave like a caged animal. The third phase shows Read back in prison, closing the film with a rather despairing shot of Read, as impersonated by Eric Bana, sitting el solitary in his prison cell. They say crime doesn't pay, but this is the first film to make the message so hard-hitting.The only real problem of Chopper is that it doesn't go into enough detail about who the characters are and why they do the things they do. Everyone in the Australian audience knows who the title character is, but the other characters, and by extension the reasons why Chopper kills some of them, are left vague. This is okay if you know who these people are and what they did, but to understand that under any other circumstances, you would probably have to read the books. It is also important to remember that a lot of the characters in the films are combinations, rather than renditions, of different people from Chopper's accounts.Still, if I can go through an Australian film and only find a single fault, it's amazing. Chopper is highly recommended as long as you don't take it seriously (as some of its critics seem to be doing). The man himself says never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn, and I am inclined to agree. I gave Chopper a seven out of ten.

Regardless, the film is mostly fiction and very simple-minded in its approach with the Dominik obviously getting off on having people get hurt without the expected reaction. EXAMPLE Chopper gets stabbed several times and the hugs and consoles his attacker. EXAMPLE A guy gets shot in the head point blank with a 4-10 gauge shotgun and wanders around with a hand over the wound before keeling over. EXAMPLE Chopper has part of his ears cut off while he sits calmly bleeding like a stuck pig giving instructions since he apparently can't do it himself. Etc. In the final analysis, Chopper is a dumb movie with poor production value and little going for it as it flounders near the bottom of the B-flick barrel in that vast wasteland called broadcast. Recommended only for Aussie crime junkies or fans of the players. (D+)  The whole idea of Chopper consoling his victims,or suffering ridiculous pain is part of the mystery and many contradictions within the man-and is likely embellished, something that is made clear throughout the film.Never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn.This is a man with little if any consideration for human life-do you expect his recollections to be exactly as they happened? It heightens the drama of a good story,so that's what he does when recalling his life.And that's what Mark Chopper Read enjoys doing.The contradictions displayed within Read's character make an incredible performance even better,in that they could have merely portrayed him as a mindless,one-dimensional thug.However,Read is not that and this film clearly illustrates this notion.Simple-minded? Hardly. Poor production values? Mate,this is an Australian film we're talking about.There's hardly the Hollywood $$$$ available,and it's gritty style perfectly fits its themes and characters.The film's sets and characters appearances are right on the money.It captures the Australian underworld better than any other film I've seen.    Only for crime junkies?

Bana made the character his own only occasionally mimicking the half giggle half laughter that generates so much fear and hostility. While most people who knew Reed and author himself has already claimed that truth was never allowed to come in the way of a good yarn, the writers cleverly placed Reed's habitual lying trait into the story that evokes even more unpredictability confusing the audience as to what to believe as a fact and what is not. It would have made Indian film makers proud or even inspired by the attitude of the protagonist in an initial ambush scene.Chopper is loosely based on the autobiography 'From the Inside' written by Mark Reed when serving time which is again loosely based on events in his life. This is not a Shawshank's redemption kind of story about survival in the harsh prison conditions for a crime you have never committed, but about one of Australia's notorious criminal who embraces the prison life often being the troublemaker. He claims more crimes than he is accused for, made more enemies than friends (an understatement) and still in the end came out the winner.Eric Bana must have worked a lot to get his mannerisms right since it does not come naturally to him based on most of the other characters he has played where he comes off as a mild mannered, less talky serious person. Here, he wouldn't shut up. Always up to something, doing bad for someone and habitually lying on every event that takes place. Though the gore and graphic violence is pretty frightening and plays as an advert to stay off prison, the screenplay is very mixed - a lighthearted exchange is followed by an intense cruel episode. A sequence when Reed and some of his acquaintances get high was innovative unlike similar scenarios dealt in other movies. All supporting actors do an excellent job.

There's no way this could happen if Bana hadn't seen and known the real thing sometime in his real life. This explains a lot. I frankly didn't understand why he was winning as many major roles as he has. But this one early role (2000) is so masterful it's in a league of its own. The setting is Australian, and for me that means putting the captions on. Bana is at least 30 pounds heavier than you've ever seen him but there's not one false move, look, or gesture out of him the entire film which is a sort of chronicle of the middle part of this criminal's life. I was completely flabbergasted. and ultimately in awe of this film. I did not expect this at all. This is not a humorous take, or a showy action-packed one. It's a straight on view into the life of a famous Australian criminal that you will never forget. I'm going to assume its available on DVD. Rent it one night when your neighbors are making too much noise.

It would be easy to have forgotten that it was a mere nine years ago at the turn of the century that the similarly themed Chopper hit cinema screens. A character study of one of Australia's most notorious and consequently, revered thugs. The dubious legend that is, Mark Brandon Chopper Read. The film helm-ed and penned by native Australian film director Andrew Dominik. It also had the distinction of being the cinematic work that initially brought actor Eric Bana to a wider world wide consciousness inevitably bringing him to Hollywood. And with his jaw dropping magnetic, metamorphic performance in Chopper It's not hard to see why. Opening with a grim, cold exterior view of Pentridge prison to the strains of Frankie Lane's melancholy rendering of Don't Fence me in, presenting immediately an indication of Dominik's, subversive technique which is partially utilised within the film. It's from there on that the writer/director is pretty expedient in establishing the complex walking contradiction that the man is. An unpredictably, violent, reprehensible show boat. As well as openly conveying a bemusing remorse or apologetic nature for his actions. It's with this in mind that with brief shots of newspaper articles as well as the recognition that the man receives. As well as the eventual testament of his notoriety and fandom, through fan mail that the unlikely celebrity, inwardly validates his flagrant self promotion. Having, no other motive, for his mind-less, actions other than to make a name for him self. As well as a shallow, pathetic need for adulation or love. Which is hinted at upon the release of the older although arguably not so much wiser Read, which affords us to view his prickly relationship with his, at time's verbally acidic, morally reprehensible father(Kenny Graham). A man with which Read seems to have a pseudo loving, relationship with, mirroring slightly the unconventional affiliations and relationships he has with the supporting antagonists/protagonists. His prostitute girlfriend Tanya (Kate Beahan) with whom the Aussie crook has a more, prickly and verbally abusive co-existence with. Small time drug baron, Neville Bartos (Vince Colisimo) and his cronies as well as two members of the local constabulary, (Bill Young, Peter Hardy) who Read is covertly recruited and employed by as an informant. While not forgetting the roguish sociopaths visit to former prison cell-mate and recruit turned turncoat and now junkie Jimmy Loughnan (Simon Lyndon). Now married to the heavily pregnant and obnoxious, loud mouth spouse Mandy (Skye Wansey). All characters and actors effortlessly bounce of Bana/Read, their reactions to the man reflecting the audience's bemusement. But how much is fact and how much is fiction is something to some extent isn't of too great importance. As Read quite knowing points out early on. Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. And it's something that Dominik most likely adheres to. Conceding that with the man,(who himself wrote several auto-biographies)you never quite knew how much truth behind the myth there was, which lends a nice, ambiguous touch and contrast to the man. The duplicity which is the man that is Mark Brandon Read, and his dubiously, legendary personae. With the inevitable conclusion that Reads unpredictable nature eventually makes him public enemy number one (look out for a wickedly sublime moment where Chopper attempts to extort money from Bartos in his luxury home). It also cement's the bizarreness of Reads contradictory personality in a sublime moment of eccentricity, the rouge aids in spiriting the drug baron to seek medical attention at hospital. True or false it is part and parcel of the folkloric image behind the villain. Shot in mainly dark, dim lighting which beautifully evokes the mood of the movie as well as the murky morality of the man as is the media attention he receives. And It's to some extent that the movie in It's self is not above scrutiny. After all, although not necessarily attempting to glorify Read there is something questionable about basing a movie around a person who is for the most part without any real ethics or moral code other than to bathe in the light of his permissible celebrity. Not to mention that several light hearted moments, namely a scene where a subversive moment where in the events of a shooting are retold. Recited as a black nursery rhyme by three cast members, to the strains of Old Lang Sine. It's professionally orchestrated and yet with some of the black laced humour of the movie. It is in danger of being misinterpreted as flippantly playing down the severity of Reads actions. An error which it can be argued can be easily made in other cult movies which chronicle the actions of protagonists with questionable scruples. I.e. Trainspotting, The Krays.The end result is a film that is both at turns a fascinating insight, all be it a flawed one in to the mythological as well factual account of one man. One who arguably should be exempt from any attention or interest he may receive. But in a world where the media and the skewered perception of certain people hold's sway. Sinners can quite easily be turned in to saints and vice versa. In this respect Dominks film is quite apt and in some small way as in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killer's. Is something that the writer/director is striving to highlight.

It proves once and for all if you have a good script you don't need a high budget. The film was obviously made on the cheap but it hardly matters. Even though its not flawless, Chopper essentially has a story to tell and tells it very well. The films only flaw is that it seems to rush his rise to fame towards the end a bit (for once I wish the filmmakers had added on a half hour). Still, it manages to fully develop its infamous protagonist. This is as much a character study as it is a crime drama.As Chopper, Eric Bana is revelatory. Bana perfectly delivers the hilarious script by Andrew Dominik. He alternates between childlike naivety and extreme brutality. Bana makes the character believable despite his intense and unpredictable mood swings and manages to avoid going over-the-top. Giving a ludicrous portrayal would be very easy to do for Mark Read, who is a larger-than-life individual. Fortunately, Bana is completely perfect. Its obvious from the start the man had talent.The direction and writing by Andrew Dominik are very good also. The film is always entertaining and quickly paced and the dialog alternates from hilarious and charming to chilling and dangerous, just like Chopper himself. As I said earlier, the film seems a bit too condensed and should have been longer, but what we have is still one of the finest films of the decade. I'm looking forward to Dominik's future projects.

I am Australian and live in Perth and if you aren't Australian and want to watch the best Aussie film ever made-this is it.For those of you who aren't in the know, and i will assume thats anyone who does not live in Australia, Mark Brandon Read (Chopper as we know him) is an infamous Australian criminal. Less well known for his actual crimes, he made a name for himself by having his ears CHOPPED off whilst in prison. He also is hard to miss, having extensive tattooing all over his body. Lastly, most well known after writing around 10 best selling books again whilst in prison.This movie is a semi-biographical look at Chopper and his life. Many of the things in the movie are mixtures of real events that Chopper claims to have happened, however, the things that he says happened are open to discussion as he has no proof. Usually the most shocking parts of the film are the ones that have actually happened.To understand Australian culture is to understand this movie. I will say that yes, in some circles Chopper is a legend. he is definitely an Australian Icon whether Australia wants him to be or not. Brief history of Australia will cement the fact that we look up to criminals-look at Ned Kelly. So yes, Chopper is a part of Australian culture.After seeing the film and having read several of the books, i was interested in meeting him. Many people who live in Melbourne have met him as he lives there usually. Luckily i didn't have to wait long, as he toured not long after, and he still tours every now and then. Well his tour consists of him going to the local pub to talk about his life, share some stories, answer some questions and then sign Chopper memorabilia. (books, dvds etc) After getting my autograph and having a quick hello, my image of the man was shattered as yes the real thing is a disappointment. He does not like women. I am a woman. Otherwise he was true to form, everything Eric Bana portrays is to a T!Speaking of Eric Bana, he is an amazing actor, a great export from Oz. See the movie, it is sick and funny and scary.

This is not a film for everyone, which is a shame, because its one of the best films (if not the best) of 2000, and anyone interested in film and acting must see it. This is outlaw cinema for real, and I have to wonder what the hell Andrew Dominik the director & writer of the film will do as a follow up. To me on the basis of this first film of his, Dominik appears to be one of the more original filmmakers around, but I fear that like many of his fellow Australian movie makers he'll be gobbled up by Hollywood,which might be exactly what Mr. Dominik is hoping for. Based on the life and career of the bigger than life criminal and murderer Mark Chopper Read, the film begins in prison where Chopper is serving jail time for trying to kidnap a judge. The raw and shocking violence begins here, and continues as the film follows Chopper after he gets released from jail. At one point he tells his low life junkie whore girlfriend that he would like to have a normal life and watch the sunsets like everyone else, this is said right before he goes into one of his rages, and beats Tanya to a pulp, and knocks out her mom when she tries to get him to stop. This is just one example of the stuff Chopper pulls, and is one of the milder scenes in the film. You laugh as you cringe. Dominik uses short and taunt scenes to tell this strange fierce story,he doesn't want to bore. The editing is sharp and fast, the acting is fine and Eric Bana as Chopper gives a great and stunning performance, this is a star is born role, he's that good and new.

Brilliant performances by Eric Bana (Chopper) and Simon Lyndon (Jimmy Loughnan) and moments of brilliance from the director (Andrew Dominik) make this film well worth seeing. I would say this is the most visually violent film I have seen in many years and honestly made me turn from the screen on several occasions (Reservoir Dogs hasn't got a look-in for the ear chopping stuff compared to this!), however the brilliance of this film along with it's performances is it's clever script and sharp dialogue - the most stubborn viewer will find it hard to resist  laughing at some of the most shocking scenes in the film basically because the dialogue and characters are so funny in this film.

But so long as you go into the film understanding that you are about to see a film based on actual crimes, people and events, then the extremity doesn't seem to exaggerate nor detract from the story at all.A fantastic film, full of quirk, wit, action, and a whole lot of tattoes... 10/10!

As written and directed by Andrew Dominik and portrayed by Eric Bana, Chopper is a monster, a rogue, a tell of tall stories, a killer and altogether fascinating. Bana delivers a tour de force performance, possibly the finest by an Australian actor in the last 10 years. This is a violent, confronting movie that will shock and dismay. It is also extremely funny and moving and it delves into the psyche of this at times terrible individual. Those concerned the movie is a glorification of a criminal need have few concerns.

It's rare that a film based on books can get that weird, idiosyncrasy that comes with autobiographical writing, but I think that's what was so entrancing about the film.

So it was with some trepidation that I finally sat down and watched Chopper about six months ago.  I've watched it two or three times since, and it's only since Eric Bana has become the latest Hollywood it boy that I felt compelled to comment.  Because, very simply, Eric is the star of the show.  It's a masterful piece of acting.At the end of the day, career crim Mark 'Chopper' Read it presented as a bit of a sad git.  He's paranoid and has a serious anger management problem.  In Pentonville prison, he stabs one of his many enemies in the face with a pair of pliers, then offers him a cigarette by way of apology.  In the movie's most disturbing scene, we watch as he instructs a fellow inmate to hack off his ears.  There is no rhyme or reason to Chopper.  He dances to the beat of his own drum.When he's released from prison, he has a few scores to settle.  Or does he?  It becomes impossible to separate fact from fiction.  Chopper is a teller of tall tails!  He spreads rumours about himself, then denies them.  Is he working for the police?  Do half the drug dealers in Melbourne have a contract on his life?  Or is Chopper just some sort of paranoid schizophrenic?This is Eric Bana's movie.  Supporting characters come and go, we aren't given enough information to care about them.  Bana's screen presence is incredible.  He IS Chopper.  Whenever he's on screen, he commands attention.  A lot of detail is left out- the screenwriters seem to assume that the viewer will be familiar with Chopper's story.  Most of us here in Oz are, but I can imagine overseas audiences being a little mystified.  His writing is thrown in ten minutes from the end as almost an afterthought.  His connections to half the people he antagonises aren't fully explained.Something that surprised me is how funny this movie is.  I was laughing out loud for most of it.  The most amazing part of Bana's performance is that his Chopper is likable.  You're actually rooting for him!  He's portrayed as a bit of a larrikin, a genuine down to earth Aussie bloke.  This is a man who punches his girlfriend in the face, then headbutts her mother.  He's fond of waving his gun at people.  He exposes himself to women in bars.  The fact that we don't find him completely reprehensible is a testiment to the subtlety of Bana's performance.  He has Chopped down pat.  His voice.  His mannerisms.  His genuine but slightly off kilter charm.  You're invited to almost feel sorry for him.  He loves the media circus he has created, but the final scene is of him sitting in his prison cell, alone and cut off from a world in which he is really nothing but a novelty.It's not pretty.  In fact, in places is downright disturbing.  But the comparisons to movies like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels are justified.

I heard of the film but I had never seen or even knew what it was about.  All I knew was how extreme it and funny it was all at the same time.   Eric Bana was also a name that I had never come across apart from what I saw of him in black Hawk Down and even then I didn't know him but Chopper was his big break.    The extra's on the DVD are just hilarious when you watch the real Mark Chopper Read in action and when he was demonstrating to Eric Bana how his ears were cut off and what he was saying when it happened.   What was most funny when the real Chopper couldn't believe how long it was going to take for the actual film to be released.   In the eyes of the public and Chopper of course  movie take a year or so but the interview took place in 98 and was told that the movie was to be officially released and his words `The Year 2000, I'll be dead by then'.   That's how he is, just a big paranoid schizophrenic. From watching Mark Read in the extras Eric Bana plays him down to a tee. The Violence is top notch and just as disturbing as any other film but it's the dark humour which keeps you from thinking that this really happened but it did and that's what scary about the film.   If you come across Chopper then don't think about watching it just do it because you will not be disappointed and you will laugh your ass off all the way through it but for the wrong reasons.

Eric Bana exudes charisma as Read, his crimes may be horrifying but when he drives his victims to the hospital after getting what he wants, how can you not like him?  And though I found it enjoyable, that's also the problem with it.Chopper is portrayed as a real life Mr Blonde, glamorised as a witty killer (the commentary track suggests that having had his own ears cut off, he should have been Tarantino's Ear Cutting Technical Advisor &#150; `They don't stop bleeding') but the thing is, Mr Blonde is fictional.  The film follows the trend of West end gangsters releasing books that recite with pride the gory details of their crimes and the ethics behind them, as if `I only killed other criminals' should validate cold blooded murder.  When tall tales are told in Big Fish, they don't do any harm.  Here, Choppers theory of `Never let ting the truth get in the way of a good yarn' isn't sufficiently conveyed to an audience that might well take it all as gospel.   It would be obtuse to complain about the violence in a film about the life of Chopper Read, he is unrepentant, in fact proud of his crimes (convicted or not), so you must expect and accept a certain level of bloodshed, which I do.

The criminal underworld, the police and even the media takes notice of Read, thus propelling him into an unorthodox celebrity.        The docudrama fails to show Read's modus operandi, how and why he enters the criminal milieu.  It purposely begins with his incarceration in the seventies.

Eric Bana takes hold of this role, as the real life Mark Chopper Read did with the Aussies attention. The film begins with Read incarcerated for an attack on former friend Neville Bartos, played by the equally engaging Vince Colosimo. Moving back in time to his first prison stay, the character development of Chopper takes place through various relationships and violent encounters. What stays with us is the ironic guilt Chopper holds for his actions. Always remorseful, ever charming Mark Read commits acts of aggression against himself and others with an unusual penchant for humor. Whether with the flick of a pistol or the switch of a blade, Chopper moves through life with what he perhaps believes is control. All evidence would prove contrary as space only exists between his times in jail and not in-spite of them.Skewed and out-of-sorts, the film along with its main-character bounce through the tumultuous crime riddled years of his infamous career. Overwhelming at times the picture achieves success through following Read closely, revealing his nuances and tastes... which seem to end just beyond animal instincts. Though that's the Chopper Read you most certainly love to love! And we do love him. In a very up-front and honest way his character is precisely the type of criminal one would hope to know, if one had to know one. Forthright with his intentions we are never lead to think he wants anything out of life... excluding loyalty, and your money of course. Perhaps the only thing getting in the way of him being the nastiest of Australian thugs is his need to amuse those fans he has found by default. Ultimately leading to a best seller on the Down-Under book shelves, Read is refreshing in that he admits to all his crimes. Though he's only ever prosecuted for one of them.Chopper is a terrific film for the independent fan. Winner of the Sundance film festival, and catalyst for Bana's current popularity here in the US Chopper is at times too much for the average movie-goer... though if you're on the look for a movie in the way of Reservoir Dogs or any ultra-violent, black comedy than Chopper is for you.

There is this real life person/criminal Mark Chopper Read of whom life this film is based on even though this is not a biography as we learn at the beginning of the picture. The film is pretty close to Natural Born Killers and although these films are not masterpieces, they are not definitely bad and uninteresting either.I was pretty annoyed with the violence in couple of scenes. The brutal stabbing at the beginning of the film and the hitting of a lady later in the film are gratuitous scenes of violence and do nothing to the story and to the film itself. I can't understand why they had to make those scenes so brutal and disgusting; that's why I'd like to hear the DVD's commentary track by the director so if he could say something about those scenes. It seems like they only wanted to throw some fake blood as much as possible in the first scene and it becomes too repellent, even though the film tries to be funny during that scene. Brutal and horrific violence can be an important element in a piece of art, if violence is used wisely and it has a meaning and a message can be seen through it. Films like this are for example Kazuyoshi Kumakiri's Kichiku dai Enkai, John McNauhgton's Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer and Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal√≥ o le 120 Giornate di Sodoma. Those films are disturbing in their imagery but they are one of the greatest pieces of art among cinema. But Chopper is not all bad film definitely and the message during the film is that how society can allow this kind of thing to be entertainment and why this sells so much and interests people? The same themes as in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. Chopper is also genuinely funny at times but I would've rated this film higher if it had had more brains instead of gore and (sometimes stupid) laughs.Also, worth mentioning are couple of extremely original cinematic styles and techniques which show that the first time director Andrew Dominik has talent and is an interesting new film maker. The colours during the whole film are incredibly beautiful and effective and it adds to the potential the film has. So I think that the director deserved all the directing prices he had but the film itself is not worth prices, I think. Now I'm waiting to see more from that director/writer and wish all the best for him.But I'll recommend this slightly to people who want definitely to see this (as I wanted) but don't expect it to be too intelligent or outstanding. And for gorehounds who only want to see shocks and intestines, this is not THAT gory as you may have read but to the mainstream audience, this may be too much to stomach.Great potential, but a minor disappointment, but definitely not a bad film, so 6/10.

I had no idea this was based upon fact, nor did I expect the movie to be this entertaining and frankly, such an engaging portrait of a very dangerous, schizophrenic guy.  Chopper's mood swings are titanic, and I found it fascinating that after committing a hideously violent or near-violent act, he would withdraw and realize what he'd done, begin to feel bad for it, then simply move on.  Every now and again you meet folks who come on like this, and your best instincts tell you to stay the hell away from them.  Here we follow one of these fellows around for a while, in prison and on the street in Melbourne (yeah, we Yanks know that it's Mel-Burn already).Like other crime movies of the last 10 years, Chopper does a stellar job of putting a human face on very bad, twisted people, and at the end (spoiler), when Chopper is back all alone in his cell after the television program, without an audience, without anyone to intimidate, without anyone to have a paranoid reaction to, I kind of felt sorry for him.  Okay, I did feel bad for him.  I really wondered what the guy was going to do next.Lots of good moments (here come more spoilers, watch out!) too.  Very funny when he gets his wang out in the bar while carrying on his conversation with the police (?), and it's an odd twist that though there is some bloodletting involved in the story, most of that blood is Chopper's (well, except for that nemesis of his at the beginning).  The sped-up motion during the brief scene involving cocaine was clever and funny in a shameful, familiar way, and what's better than a young, pregnant junkie stroking a shotgun, then spying on a murder in the wrong (!) parking lot of a night club. Well...truth, fiction, you know.Eric Bana is in every frame of this movie and he's terrific...I just saw him in Ridley Scott's outstanding Blackhawk Down (which did a fine job of staying true to what happened and what was in the book...an acquaintance of mine was a Ranger in Somalia in '93 and wounded in that operation) and I thought that Bana's Delta character had all the best and appropriate lines in that movie.  I mentioned it to my buddy and he told me to check out Chopper.  He gets a beer.I don't recall this being out in the States at all, but I'm sure it wouldn't have made a dime.

It was one of the highlights of my trip to the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival.  I'm a connoisseur of movie villains (good guys get the girl ... bad guys get the one-liners) and am happy to announce that star Eric Bana (a stand-up comedian by trade) has earned a place on my elite Scum of the Earth All-Star Team with this role.  It's a bravura over-the-top performance about one TWISTED fast-talking career criminal who eventually became a best-selling author despite being functionally illiterate.The film is set basically in two chapters ... one of them during an early prison stretch, the other years later, when he was out of prison for one of the few times in his adult life and facing a contract death for being a police informant.  The framing device is him doing a television interview from prison, recounting his various exploits.It's hard to know where fact and fiction part ways in this film, because Read was a notorious B.S. artist who was only too happy to engage in colorful braggadocio to enhance his notoriety.  (Never let truth get in the way of a good story, he quips at one point.)  But there can be no doubt that he was one colorful cretin, and Bana captures him as such perfectly. The film is not for the squeamish but if you could appreciate previous classic scum performances (Michael Gambon in THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER, Dennis Hopper in BLUE VELVET, and Benoit Poelvoorde in MAN BITES DOG, to name three), it's WELL worth checking out.  I hope that the film can find an American distributor or at least get released on video.  I'd certainly like to see it again sometime.

The over the top performances of De Niro in Cape Fear and Pacino in Scarface are a case in point. The need to underplay characters especially those prone to sudden outbursts of violence can be a tricky banana skin to avoid.  Pleasingly this has not been a problem for Eric Bana who gives a bravura performance as Aussie criminal cult figure, Mark Chopper Read.With a stare, twitch, eyeroll or fidget, Bana displays perfectly the idiosyncrasies common to those members of our society who can erupt at any given moment into displays of savage intensity. He both repels and attracts as the audience, especially those not familiar with the Chopper Read tale, shifts uneasily in their seats.The cinematography in the Bojangles Nightclub effectively adds to the uneasy tension which emanates from Chopper's presence. Equally creative was the speeded up sequence which appeared to come from under a corpse's body, showing the different law enforcement officers approaching for examination.However, Chopper is far from a perfect movie. The real (if we are to believe what was written in Mark Read's first book)life of the man is colourful enough without making artificial links between characters and subsequent events. Moreover, there was little evidence provided as to what Chopper Read had actually done prior to being in prison for the opening scenes of the movie. This would have been extremely helpful to explain his paranoia on being released from prison. We needed to see how he had created terror in the Melbourne criminal fraternity to know why he was such a marked man later on. The scene with the painter and docker in prison alluded to this but wasn't enough.Ultimately, the strength of Chopper lies in the performance of Eric Bana and on the creativity of the director, either of which make it a must see movie.

The dialogue in here was extremely hard to understand at times. Oh, you get the gist of things, but sometimes the dialogue may as well have been in Chinese. Chopper is in jail acting like the Big Man on Campus, and next he is getting stabbed by his friend Jimmy. Chopper just stands there and doesn't fight off the stabbings. What is going on? I thought it was a ploy to get him to the infirmary. Next up is a hearing of sorts. Next thing you know he is out of prison and going after people who he thinks did him wrong. He shoots some people and acts like a man out of control, then he becomes somewhat stable. Last scenes show him back in jail and apparently he writes about his life and becomes a famous writer in Australia. Choppy, choppy, choppy is all I can say. Okay, to be fair, maybe the book wasn't as choppy as this movie. Now, how much of all this is true and how much is made up we have no way of knowing, but we don't really care. At first when we see Chopper in jail and the bizarre language he uses, I briefly had the thought that this was going to be a comedy of sorts or a satire, but this was not any of those. There could have been some comedy when Chopper tries to get the police to let him be an informer so they would look the other way for his crimes. Those scenes with the cops could have been funny, but alas, they were not. There is no flow to any of this. We watch Chopper and cannot figure out what he is going to do next. Is this suspense? No. Apparently, the Editor of this didn't know what to do next either. Chopper doesn't commit any crimes except to Off or WOUND his&#x85;&#x85; let's call them associates, not friends. And, calling them associates appears to be too chummy. So really, what we have here is a man out of control, who writes about being out of control, becomes famous for that behavior and everyone says Great Job. I don't buy it. The acting by all is fairly good. Eric Bana does do a credible job as Chopper. He's the whole show but to be honest, it's fairly easy to act like a person out of control and some would call that excellent acting. I am not one of them. And, if you look closely at the scenes the cast was involved in, most characters are in mortal fear of their lives from Chopper and again, those are easy performances the way I think. Is this tension? I didn't feel any. Australian movies used to be very, very good (Picnic at Hanging Rock, Master and Commander come to mind) but somehow they seemed to have lost their way and have become almost non-existent and maybe have run their course. Maybe they are working on learning Mandarin. Violence Yes. Sex No. Nudity Yes, and Chopper exposes himself in a night club. Language Yes.

They had really made it out to be a violent and over the top movie showing the life of one of the most violent criminals there has been, and that's not what I saw.It was a good movie, but it felt quite loose in structure and seemed to leap a lot of the life of Mark Chopper Reid and go straight onto the latter years. It also portrayed him more as a man battling with his anger and paranoia than a criminal. It even tried to show him in a more appealing light as a likable, bur clearly violent rogue.None of this worked for me, and I really want to read the book to understand what the real story was and where the film went wrong in it's portrayal. There seemed to be no real progression or development to the story, and other than a few earlier scenes it concentrates on an already developed character who is just falling apart.Saying that, the acting by Eric Bana is fantastic. Watching the real Chopper on the DVD it was quite astounding how close Bana had managed to make his portrayal and capture the quirks of the character.

Bana is a whirling dervish of violent emotions that frequently crossover into the psychotic, but he's careful (complicit with Dominik's spare, simple but well-constructed script, based on Read's books) not to reveal too much verbally about his character, letting only the occasional existential thought slip out. Instead he lets Read's violence--which includes self-mutilation as well as murder and maiming--do the talking because as random as it appears, each violent act has a point, a means of moving Read's life forward toward his goal of superstardom--it's almost as if he's a man who considers violence his job. Bana is galvanizing--appealing and frequently hilarious--but doesn't allow respect; it would be a disservice to his character, because though he inspires fear in those around him, everyone's looking to get even and while they don't succeed, they keep on trying. Dominik spans two decades of Read's life with strong pacing and a great sense of place, and while he frequently gets a little tricked-out (Danny Boyle is the obvious influence here) he still has made a mature, thoughtful film about violence and how it's seen by the perpetrator.

It's true the film is extremely difficult to watch at times - especially the ears bit - but it is also evocative and really brings home the futility of crime.

The pre-credit sequence shows us Chopper in prison watching, with initially unidentified mates, Chopper on television, bragging flippantly about his latest criminal outrages.  Two Choppers.  Later, he tries to explain his violent, paranoiac outbursts to his girlfriend as schizophrenia - these two Choppers, one literally media-ted, the other 'real' in the world of the film seem to confirm this.  But is this second Chopper real; in this scene, as throughout the film, the mise-en-scene is highly stylised, in terms of angles, Chopper's bravado, and the queasy colour which veers from dull blue, to neon olive to blood red to sickly green, but never into something recognisably 'real'. Indeed, the most realistic scenes  seem the most stylistically contrived; for instance, when a jealous and paranoid Chopper finally blows his top at a nightclub.  Any nightclub will have this kind of jagged strobe lighting, it's perfectly realistic.  And yet, this realism produces the utmost stylisation, seeming to hyperactively chop up the action, perhaps an expression of Chopper's unhinged mind, just as he colours the other, less realistic scenes.  Is this what that credit sequence was, then, a visualising of Chopper's mental unbalance, someone who can't see the world clearly, calmly, but as a seriously perverse Tex Avery cartoon; alternately trapped, locked up, literally when he is in jail, but also in his paranoia, his personality and persona, his violent instincts; and free, capable of transforming his environment, his dead-end identity, nature itself, the society that would see him (censoriously or not) as a psychopath.  Because ultimately Chopper is free - we will never know how many people he has killed, we will never be able to sift the 'truth' from the good yarns Chopper spins; the colour and stylisation in the film never pins him down.  This is not necessarily the freedom he wants.The best bits in Chopper are those that emphasise performance,  Chopper playing a role, whether in action, or in telling stories, replaying scenes differently.  In the case of shooting the Turk, for instance, there seems to be a 'true' account, the first shooting, followed by three differing accounts, all subjective and motivated by hidden agendas.  But if the film takes place in Chopper's head, than even the first is totally unreliable.From friends, reviews, and trailers, I'd gotten the idea that 'Chopper' was some kind of black comedy, so I was surprised to find it so grim.  No matter how stylised, the violence is quite shocking, and Chopper's character quickly becomes monotonous.  There is enough trickery to keep one intersted throughout, and any scene with the lame Neville is hilarious.  The prison stabbing scene is beautiful and homoerotic - stab-stab-stab; hug; lie down; post-coital cigarette.  There is an interesting dichotomy between Chopper's paranoia and the seeming lack of surveillance in the prison. But I could have done without the Freudian-Oedipal stuff and the violence-and-the-media cliches.  It is very important to tell stories like Chopper's, I guess; I prefer 'Taxi Driver', from which this film borrows heavily, except its sense of narrative; or 'Seul Contre Tous', a real nauseating trip down the 'wild' side.

Some thug.  That's all I knew when I walked in, and that's all I know now.  If you think there's something morally wrong about modelling a work of fiction on a real - and still living - celebrity criminal, you're absolutely right - and I don't buy the defence that it's okay because it's not meant to be sensationalist.  It's not MEANT to be sensationalist...  But even if it really isn't, I don't see why they couldn't have made much the same film about someone who DIDN'T exist.  It's not as if Chopper's story, in all its precise detail, is such a good one that THAT'S the story they had to film - in fact the story is rather ordinary, so much so that it's doubtful there's any story at all.  Nor do they adhere to precise details in any event.  Before the film begins we're told that it's based LOOSELY on Chopper's life, that it isn't a documentary - a cowardly thing to say we KNEW it wasn't a documentary; this is just the film-makers waving a get out of critical scrutiny free card in front of our faces.Anyway, this aside, it's painful to watch.  That wasn't a compliment.  (Well, OBVIOUSLY it wasn't a compliment, but I'm afraid the film-makers might take it as one.)  It's not the subject matter, it's the presentation.  Every other scene is filmed in such a way as to make us look away.  (Rather defeats the purpose of the cinematographers art, I would have thought.)  The first half hour is just a repulsive - and creative, which makes matters worse - bloodbath, recorded on that cold, grimy, high-contrast, high-resolution film stock that makes human flesh look like animated wax.  The blood-letting more or less ceases after half an hour, but it's still not very easy on the eye.  Too many scenes take place in a nightclub under the intermittent glare of a strobe lamp - somehow this is even harder to endure on film than it is in real life.  Then there's the scene where Chopper and friend snort cocaine - in itself, something to avoid looking at - and everything moves jerkily.  There's also an ugly moment with a syringe.I struggled through all this looking in vain for a narrative thread, or a point.  When it suddenly ended I didn't know whether to feel relieved or cheated.  By the way, there's something dishonest about that final scene.  Chopper is chatting away with some prison guards in his cell, having a merry old time; then the guards say they have work to do, say goodbye, and (naturally) shut the door behind them.  Suddenly the light temperature drops to a dismal blue, and the camera pulls out to show Chopper sitting there - alone.  How sad, we're meant to think.  But ANYONE who has just bid his guests goodbye and is about to go to bed will be left alone like that - it's an everyday occurrence, not a penetrating comment on the nature of Chopper's existence.It's obligatory for Australian critics to mention how surprised they were by Eric Bana's masterful performance as Chopper.  Previously he had been a comic on a (dismal) sketch show called Full Frontal.  One of the reasons he was so unfunny was that all he, or the show, ever did was mimic things; I never thought he was particularly good even at that.  I STILL think he's a lousy mimic.  But it turns out he's a first-class actor.  It just goes to show...Not that the acting, or the moments of humour here and there, can redeem Chopper.  Even if the film had been good it shouldn't have been made, and it isn't good.  It's positively rotten.

But after a while you realize that it's not meant to be funny.One the one hand, not knowing anything about the real person Chopper I wondered why anyone would want to make such a non-judgemental movie about someone who was obviously very messed up.  Then after watching the bonus material on the DVD I realized that the movie makers were just cashing in on his notoriety.  Apparently Chopper was very popular with the low brow types who are entertained by weirdo misfits out in left field.  And the pseudo arty types love to think that doing movies about misfits is true art; it's so much easier than doing something that requires true creativity.It's a great movie if you love tabloid tv; Oprah interviewing some messed up person who was sexually abused by her parents, Jeraldo interviewing neo Nazis, etc.  It's not a movie that makes you think; it simply titilates those who like to sift stuff out of the gutter of life.

The title character remains inscrutable from beginning to end. Perhaps you could have a better understanding of him by reading one of his books, but watching this movie will get you nowhere. The script is very limited in its perspective, giving you only a small glimpse of Chopper's life, and the director's stylistic tricks, although often interesting, offer no insight into the character. However, there are some individual scenes in the funny/bloody Pulp Fiction mold that do grab your attention (like the early scene in which Chopper gets stabbed and at first doesn't ever realize it; I had to watch it twice!), and certainly none of the movie's faults can be blamed on Eric Bana, who does his best with a poor script.

I thought it would be a lot more violent, but the violent scenes seemed more comedic than anything else. Like Chopper gets stabbed several times by his bud in jail, and he just stands there. I mean, I think someone would fall over after that.  And then the guards at the jail act like they don't care  and aren't concerned when there is an attack in the jail.  I mean, that was just unrealistic.Eric Bana played the character well. But in most of the movie, it is like he's wearing a fat suit and some kind of prosthetic on his face to make him look like a chipmunk.  Also, I'm sure I would have thought it was better if I was from Australia and had heard of this guy Chopper before. The movie would have made more sense then.  Plus, I didn't like how one moment Chopper is in jail, then after getting his ears cut off, it jumps to him out of jail. Well what happened. Was he sent to another part of the prison for a couple of years before being released or what. The movie didn't explain it.FINAL VERDICT  This was OK. At least it is better than some mind numbing explosion filled brainless action flick.  I would recommend it to those who like unique independent films. It does have its good points.

Basically the film tells the intense story of legendary criminal Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read (Hulk's Eric Bana) sentenced to prison for 16 and a half years, and in that time making more enemies than admirers. After his own childhood friend Jimmy Loughnan (Simon Lyndon) stabs him, to be transferred out of H Division, he cut his own ears off, gaining recognition, and eventually release. Being out of prison, he visits both friends and old enemies, with not much difference between the two, and reuniting with former girlfriend Tanya (Kate Beahan), who he suspects of being involved with someone. He is killing pretty much anyone in his way and on his tail, this only results on being sent back to prison, where he writes a best selling book and a television interview. Also starring David Field as Keithy George, Daniel Wyllie as Bluey, Bill Young as Detective Downie, Vince Colosimo as Neville Bartos and Kenny Graham as Keith Read. It should be mentioned that the real Mark Brandon Read suggested Bana, then a stand-up comedian, Bana lived with Read for two weeks to get a better understanding of how to play him, and he spent two weeks eating junk food to gain the extra weight needed, extraordinary details to make a film happen. Bana is brilliant as the film's protagonist, he actually makes the character quite likable, even with the ultra-violent outbursts, which by the way make this film even more watchable. Very good!

Regardless, the film is mostly fiction and very simple-minded in its approach with the Dominik obviously getting off on having people get hurt without the expected reaction. EXAMPLE Chopper gets stabbed several times and the hugs and consoles his attacker. EXAMPLE A guy gets shot in the head point blank with a 4-10 gauge shotgun and wanders around with a hand over the wound before keeling over. EXAMPLE Chopper has part of his ears cut off while he sits calmly bleeding like a stuck pig giving instructions since he apparently can't do it himself.  Etc. In the final analysis, Chopper is a dumb movie with poor production value and little going for it as it flounders near the bottom of the B-flick barrel in that vast wasteland called broadcast. Recommended only for Aussie crime junkies or fans of the players. (D+) "}]
