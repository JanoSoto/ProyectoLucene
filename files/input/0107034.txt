Macaulay Culkin's brilliant psychotic acting in this movie was totally brilliant. Both of these 2 young actors made this movie work, the bridge scene is totally awesome.

It's not very comfortable watching a film that shows sociopaths-- people born without the ability to feel guilt and empathise with others-- are born, not made and their dangerous traits are apparent even in childhood. 'The Good Son' revolves around Mark, a motherless boy of twelve who is sent to stay with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan and two cousins, twelve-year-old Henry and six-year-old Connie. At first, Mark revels in the visit that takes his mind off his recent bereavement but he soon starts to realise that Henry is a sociopath whose parents are blind to his dark, violent side. It is a film that pulls no punches in just how malevolent Henry is and how easily he will pick off anyone who dares to interfere with his twisted sense of fun.Macaulay Culkin was excellent as the angelic-looking Henry whose boyish cuteness hide his true nature and his performance here proves he could have been one of the few child actors who graduated into a successful young adult actor had his personal life not been such a mess. It really was chilling seeing the child I was so used to seeing in comedies being so emotionally cold. But it is Elijah Wood's Mark who gives the film heart. Young Wood, only eleven years old when he filmed this, delivered a great performance as a young boy faced with the awful truth and desperate to stop Henry while juggling his grief over losing his mother. The scene where Mark is convinced Henry has poisoned the food is a perfect example of how Wood portrayed Mark's desperation, hysteria and helplessness in the face of his cousin's evil.However, one of the flaws of the film is that is a bit choppy, jumping from scene-to-scene without giving you a feel for the other characters, which is a shame because this is one film where you do need to have an understanding of just how Henry's nature affects all those around him and how he gets away with it all. I read the novelisation of the film by Todd Strasser before seeing the film so it's all the more noticeable for me. The book not only gives greater insight into Mark's budding fraternal friendship with Connie and his need to seek a mother in Susan but it also shows Susan's growing awareness to the monster Henry is and how she feels when she is made to choose between Mark and her murderous child.Overall, this film is enjoyable enough for a psychological thriller (although a few TV detective shows have done this idea in a slicker way) and it is nice to see a film that doesn't take a softly-softly attitude when dealing with the matter of children who kill. However, the ending was a bit of a cop-out as there could have been so many other avenues to explore had things ended differently for Henry (what should be done with sociopathic children? How do decent, loving families deal with such a child?). Those who do expect a bit more from their films will probably be disappointed.

How I loathe the word thriller.  It suggests roller-coasters; and the genre it denotes, at its best, deals in quiet tension.  Where was I?  Yes standard thriller.  A is really an evil person, intent on performing great harm in the future; B knows this but can't convince anyone else.  I heard that sigh.  But make A and B children, on the verge of adolescence, and not only is this tired formula invigorated, but it makes a great deal more sense.  (Especially if B is in the slightly awkward position of a cousin on an extended visit.) The creaky old scenes where B goes to the police and either he is strangely incoherent or the police are strangely obtuse, are gone.  There is now a perfectly good reason why B can't go to the police, or indeed anyone.  Nor is there anything strange about the obtuseness of A's parents.  The rotten adult seems so commonplace that we scarcely bat an eyelid; the rotten child, who is in fact far more commonplace, we like to pretend doesn't exist.So I'm glad Hollywood took this step.  I also, for the most part, like the way the step has been taken.  B has no accomplices - he must battle A alone - and his plight is keenly felt.  There's an air of plausibility about it all.  Elijah Wood is an unusually good boy, Macaulay Culkin is an unusually bad boy; both look perfectly real.  (Wood, who has the harder task, does especially well.)The climax - or what is meant to be the climax - is HIGHLY contrived.  It will probably come as a shock that the writers chose something at once so obvious and so ludicrous.  The mood of the audience I saw this with - it may just have been my mood - was one of grudging acceptance, granted only because we had been treated so well in the events leading up to it.

Believe it or not, such a situation is not uncommon. And Culkin does an excellent job. His coolness, his sudden changes of approach without any apparent shifting of gears, his complete lack of emotional reaction - which have been interpreted by some reviewers as poor acting - are actually very realistic. Personally, I find his calm and apparently effortless demeanour more frightening than the ravings of the lunatics in many other horror films.Unfortunately, the plot lacks all credibility. Certainly psychopaths are excellent con-men (in fact, they are the most typical con-men) but it is absurd to believe that a child like this could have covered his tracks so well that his parents do not even suspect that there is something wrong with him. Even more ridiculous is that his behaviour towards his little sister - whom he hates enough to try to kill her - has been so good in the past that she trusts him completely.  The cliches of the over-dramatic ending are also a bit much. A pity, because there is much of value in the film. "},{"Title":"Surprisingly enjoyable!

However, Mark learns that Henry is twisted and evil, whilst his mum and dad reckon he's a good boy.Although Henry is twisted and evil, Culkin shows another side to him which shows that he wants attention. After killing his younger brother Richard and attempting to kill his sister, I can only lead to one conclusion that Henry was once the oldest and had all the attention and became jealous when his brother and sister were born. And then Mark comes along and Henry feels threatened with his mother comforting another boy. A very different role from the Home Alone series and surprisingly brilliantly done!Elijah Wood is brilliant as Mark who feels guilty for not being able to save his mother from cancer. At the same time as grieving, he has to protect Henry's sister from Henry and also try and convince Henry's parents that Henry is not as good as they like to think.What I did not like about the film is the ending to have a mother given a choice on which child should fall........ its a bit sick.Also, the film was too short. It would have been interesting to actually see how Richard died and also see what made Henry become evil. That part can only be theorised- it should have been put on screen!8/10!!!

Kevin is, however, a good kid. This is what Kevin could be like if he was evil. Why do I say this? Because the diabolic kid of this film is portrayed by the same boy, Macaulay Culkin. If Kevin was like this, he would have killed his family and Harry and Marv...Ironically, the movie's title refers precisely to Culkin's character instead of Elijah Wood's character (who really is the good son). And why is that? Put it this way because that's the image his family and people in general have of him and because they don't know his disturbing nature.Mac shows his other side as an actor - that is, his dark side. And he is excellent as Henry, a child who can be described as a sociopath, a psychopath, a cold-blooded murderer and mentally ill. Henry is also a perfect actor - he manages to keep his true nature in secret because of his angelical looks and apparent love and respect for the family and others. This is a completely different role for Mac, setting it apart from the others and leaving behind his 'Home Alone' image.Mac, who we are more used to see as a comedy actor with a beautiful smile, here he does some extremely cold facial expressions of dark jealousy. His character Henry also displays aggressive and violent behavior, as we see in some scenes.Elijah Wood is great as Mark. Here we see a younger Elijah Wood (when he was a kid), years before 'becoming' Frodo Baggins. Elijah was a cute kid too. Quinn Culkin is equally good as Connie and she was cute too.This film is quite short, which is a good thing. But it shares the same problem of 'Mikey' we never really get to know how did Henry become so bad. We have an idea when he says «It was mine before it was his» (refering to the rubber duck) and that he became very jealous of his brother Richard and killed him, but is that all? I doubt that's all.It's always shocking to see a child doing the horrible things that Henry does, but this movie is considerably less violent comparing to 'Mikey'. Henry is also less dangerous than Mikey, but don't get me wrong - that doesn't mean that Henry isn't dangerous - he is. It's like they say for this movie - «Evil has many faces» - and the headline for 'Mikey' could be applied here as well - «With evil, size doesn't matter».The ending is an unexpected surprise for those who watch this for the first time. Henry pays for all his crimes by being dropped off a high cliff and then we see his dead body being swept away by the sea waves.The soundtrack is entirely instrumental and consists of beautiful and soft pieces of music. Plus, the sceneries of this movie are a must. We see many beautiful settings and landscapes full of snow (this takes place somewhere in Winter time). Not to mention that Henry's house is lovely.Overall, an okay movie, but not one with enough attributes to become a classic.

I'll just give you a quick review of what I thought were the best and worst aspects of this movie. Bad aspects; the storyline was lame and poorly portrayed as the script was lacking and the pacing off. Macauly Culkin said everything in the same monotonous tone, to watch it you'd think he was just passing by the set and had reluctantly agreed to stand in for the real actor and read the lines off a board. The woman who played the mother was just plain irritating to the point where you wished the evil son would just get it over with already! The ending was lousy and a let-down for the partially promising tension the young actors (Culkin and Wood) had previously established. **SPOILER** no mother would ever do that! **SPOILER FINISHED** You're maybe wondering why I watched this movie then, well one simple factor; Elijah Wood. I borrowed the tape off a friend because I had heard he was on it and being a long-time fan of his I was eager to see it. I was not disappinted, he played the part with such rare innocence and sweetness you had to go 'awwww' as soon as he appeared your eyes were drawn immediately to him and he carried the film remarkably well. Having seen this film I am more convinced than ever that Elijah is going to be the actor of his generation and I am sure that his work in the masterpiece LOTR will soon go rewarded with an Oscar in either 2003 or 2004. He takes a film which could have been a total loss and turned it into something oddly unique and touching. Apologies for gushing but I cannot resist, even at the age of 12, Elijah had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen, I wish him the very best because any actor that could take this film and turn it into something I would be happy to watch again deserves all the credit and praise going. I can't tell you whether to see this film or not, if you are an Elijah fan it's unmissable but if not I am unsure whether this film will draw you in enough and hold your interest long enough. Conclusion; film 4-5 out of 10 Elijah Wood-10 out of 10 Good luck Elijah!!

The next day Mark is introduced to Mr. Highway-Man, a stuffed man the same size as a real human, and Henry acts out Highway-man's pretend suicide, shoving the fake man over a bridge and causing ten cars to crash. Mark becomes especially fearful for his cousin Connie, and also learns of the reason Susan likes him so much... she had a little boy of her own, Richard, who mysteriously drowned in the bathtub years ago. The Good Son appears to mimic the 1956 classic the Bad Seed. Henry acts sweet and innocent at times, but alone he becomes a monster. It was rather funny seeing Miles, the little boy who hung around with Buck in Uncle Buck, as a psychopath. Henry killed Richard, his own baby brother, over a rubber duck! Wow, kid, they sell those at the Dollarama! The music was a bit sappy at times, but is still a good soundtrack. The plot is pretty solid, though it never really explains Henry's disgusting behavior. Mark's last moments with his dying mom were very sad. The acting was excellent throughout the whole film. The Good Son was remade in 2009 as Orphan, where a Russian adopted girl wrecks a seemingly picture-perfect family.

Maybe I was missing some pretty horrible aspects to the movie. So I watched the movie again and I read the reviews. I think one of the interesting things was that people rated this movie really low because they didn't like the concept of an evil child or they added, there was no WHY concept to the reasons why the character did the things he did. I think I was mostly surprised at the Why concept. Did people really not understand that this kid felt really powerful controlling the fate of others? It was quite clear that the mean kid did not like being undermined. It was in my opinion very well introduced. At first, his enjoyment in his actions were very minor due to his first time. It seemed to me that the first time he performed his bad deeds to his brother, he might have actually been scarred or stunned. Because for a while when little Frodo enters the scene, nothing has actually happened to indicate he is a terrible child. Its not until his mother treats Frodo like her own child that Macually starts to use his will to force things the way he wants. I see similarities with how kids these days press their parents into getting what they want. I think its important to recognize the scene where little Frodo goes to the therapist and asks her about why someone could be bad for no reason, just because he likes to be bad. I think this is where people kind of go, yeah, this movie is flawed, there's no such thing. But remember, little Frodo wasn't looking down the staircase at his mother hugging another son. Its all about perspective. It can be concluded that the bad son is probably the spoiled child, and acts up in extreme ways to get what he wants because it worked before. We have two polar characters. One character is completely helpless and his fate is controlled by the other characters in this movie, where there is Culkin, whom has deep control of his life and his wants. On another note, kids doing horrible things to animals or killing other kids is not a unheard of concept. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that there are certain mentalities that cannot be explained but diagnosed with mental disorders. People in our age have been brainwashed into thinking that kids are completely innocent in the world. Which is funny when you reflect how many times in your younger life you have laughed at someone and probably made them feel really bad, even though you didn't want to. As kids we actually hurt others more than we'd like to admit, we just choose not to admit it.

Though one of the story lines focuses on what Henry has done to Richard, throughout the whole movie it seems like Henry's behavior was only coming out when Mark came in to the picture. No-one seemed to have noticed anything weird about him before, not even his little sister. Now, a sociopath can be very manipulative, and they are often charming people, but one would say that his sadistic strikes would not have been totally unnoticed, especially towards his sister. It's not completely unbelievable though when you see Mark as the trigger, suddenly being competition for Henry, as Richard was, so OK, the movie can get away with that.What I think was less forgiving was that the movie was all just far too predictable. Watching the mother standing where she liked to come to rest; you do not need to be psychic to understand that this is the place for the final part. To me; all the clues in the movie were far too obvious. It just never surprised me. An other thing is that it lacked in depth. All the elements are there, but it never goes deep. It's like a bow with the potential for a good shot, but the archer just doesn't pull the string back enough to give it real power. The acting was mediocre, though I was pretty impressed by a young Elijah Wood. His big eyes are gorgeous, and his acting, compared to that of Macaulay Culkin, really stood out. Elijah was the one carrying this movie and I'm glad they put him in the role of Mark, and not Macaulay. Macaulay did a reasonable job, especially at the beginning of the movie, but like many things in The Good Son, he lost his strength throughout. At the end, he really did not convince me anymore. All in all, I think more could have been done with the potentially interesting theme of this movie. You don't necessarily have to make a thriller out of it; you could also focus on it being a drama, but The Good Son tried to do both and unfortunately it failed on both sides. It wasn't scary enough, it wasn't dramatic enough. I just can not give it more than a 5 out of 10.

Coming off their breakout performances in Radio Flyer and Home Alone respectively these two proved to be great young actors with potential. It is furthered here, although it now seems only Wood has taken it to the next level with Culkin not acting for some time.Wood is exceptionally good in the several emotional sequences he has throughout and Culkin really does bring his evil character to life. The supporting cast, particularly Wendry Crawson is also very good and make this film better than it could have turned out.The film builds up the tension and suspense as it progresses, leading to an well-executed climax.

They rush to the hospital where Mark's mother lay dying. They had a little talk then she passed away. After the funeral, Mark's dad was called away on business and he would go so he'd never have to leave Mark again. Mark's Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan agreed to take in Mark while his dad was away. So they venture up to the house the next day. Wallace and Susan have two kids Henry and Connie. They did have another son, Richard, but he sadly died by drowning in the bath tub. He was only 3-years-old! Henry was a real rambunctuous youth. It seemed as though he would be the perfect friend for Mark. The next day, Henry and Mark go into the woods and climb up Henry's high treehouse. Then they go to an old abandoned factory and find tremendous fun throwing rocks through the windows. A foreman yelled at them so they ran. They ran into an old wishing well where Henry showed Mark some cigarettes he'd been stashing. They talk. Henry crosses the line when talking about Mark's mother and he threatened to hit him but Henry said if he did, he'd push him down the well. He then apologized. When they went to bed that night, Henry promised twice as much fun the next day.        In the morning, Henry showed Mark a gun he had built. It fired steel bullets. He tried shooting a cat and luckily missed. Then they got chased across a bridge by a fierce dog. Henry got out the gun, aimed for that same dog, fired...And hit him! Mark could not believe it. They toss the carcass down the well. Henry then shows Mark his shed which was filled with all sorts of odd things. One being a mannequin Henry built and called Mr. Highway. Henry asks Mark's help in carrying it to the overpass above the highway. It was then that Henry revealed why the mannequin was named Mr. Highway Henry pushes it off the overpass and right into oncoming traffic! A giant automobile accident occurs. Mark was speechless but Henry claimed a portion of the accident was Mark's fault, because he had helped. Mark's father had set up a meeting with Mark and psychologist Dr. Davenport. Mark was enjoying staying at his aunt and uncle's, but he deeply missed his mother. He believed that when someone dies, they come back in some other form so Mark thought his mother had come back as Susan. One evening, Wallace and Susan go out to dinner, leaving Henry, Mark and Connie all alone. Henry suggests a game of hide and seek in the dark. He seemed as if he wanted to hurt Connie so Mark had to find her quick.         Henry was pure evil, but he hid it all behind his big smile and his insipid manner. He then began telling lies about Mark, making everyone think HE was the crazy one. Henry takes Connie ice skating and tosses her onto thin ice. She falls in and is hospitalized. Mark tries to tell Susan about Henry and she doesn't believe him. Susan finds Richard's rubber duckie in Henry's shed and she finally begins to suspect him. She also suspects that perhaps Richard's drowning was no accident. They go for a walk to the cliff Susan often stands on, thinking of Richard. Henry tries to push her off when Mark comes to stop him. The two begin wrestling and roll off the cliff. Luckily Susan caught them but they were both slipping. She would have to let one go to help the other. She finally let's go of Henry and brings Mark up. The demonic Henry falls to his death and Mark ponders over if Susan had to do that over again, would she do it the same way?       An interesting movie. It's chilling. Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone stars as the psychotic little cretin, Henry. Elijah Wood (North) is Mark. Wendy Crewson (The Santa Clause) is Susan and David Morse (The Green Mile) is Jack. This movie's beginning is a real bummer when Mark loses his mother. It's so sad. Now about my summary line. I said that First he was Home Alone, but now, nobody's home. If you don't get it, I'll explain. See, we all know that Macaulay Culkin was in Home Alone and in it he played a kid who was home all alone. But now nobody's home. That's an expression about crazy and fargone people that means they're crazy or fargone. When you're referring to a person by saying nobody's home, you're saying he's got no sense, no reason, no actual consciousness or care of what he's doing. Thus, nobody's home! I sure hope you get it now. But anyway, this movie is no comedy and it isn't for children! Unless you want them having nightmares, but if not, I recommend The Good Son!

The movie has elements of all those films, but its disturbing factor, which should be the selling part of the movie, is focused upon so much that many other elements in the story are ignored entirely as the movie progresses. What results is a mess of a movie that, at the time of its release, appealed to the wrong demographic entirely.Macaulay Culkin got the headlining credit, even though Elijah Wood is really the lead actor and the moral compass of the story. For those who don't remember the early '90's, Culkin and Wood were the top child stars of cinema who were compared frequently. They were like Pepsi & Coke, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, Britney & Christina, etc. You would think the first movie they would star in together would appeal to kids.That's the bad part The Good Son, as a result of incorrect marketing, appealed highly to kids upon its release in 1993, even though it was rightfully rated R. Being a fan of the two actors, particularly Culkin, when I was a kid, I remember seeing the movie's poster with Culkin's face displayed prominently, & thinking Cool, another Macaulay Culkin movie! I have to see this! I was later bummed to find out that the movie was rated R. I have no doubt, however, that millions of kids my age felt the exact same way I did.It was just wrong to cast two well-known child actors in these dark roles. It would be one thing if the child actors were unknowns, but since Culkin made a name for himself with the hugely popular Home Alone films, kids wanted to see whatever movie he was in. It was the equivalent of casting Miley Cyrus in Requim for a Dream and putting a large poster of her face above Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's faces. Kids would want to see it regardless of the subject matter, and adults wouldn't want to necessarily see it because it has a kid's star in it.I saw it years after it came out, when I was old enough to watch R-rated movies. When I saw it the first time, I admit that I liked it. After seeing it recently as a mature adult, the movie has some major problems.Elijah Wood plays Mark Evans, a child whose mother has just died. His father (David Morse), immediately following the funeral, goes on a business trip and promises his son that he'll return and spend more time with him, thereby creating a giant plot hole nearly ten minutes into the film. Why didn't his father take time off after the death of his wife? Why would he leave his grieving son alone!?!Regardless, his father takes him to his uncle's house to stay until he returns. Mark's Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) seem normal, which is why you wonder how their son Henry (Macaulay Culkin), who is Mark's age, became so messed up. You learn as the film progresses and Mark & Henry spend so much time together that Henry is one unbelievably sociopathic 10-year-old. He kills innocent animals with a crossbow he made himself, throws a mannequin off a bridge into traffic just to see the cars crash, and repeatedly tries to kill his younger sister Connie (Quinn Culkin). All the while, Henry's parents, while they are good people and not abusive or inattentive, manage to be completely oblivious to their son being a reincarnation of Ted Bundy.It's not unbelievable that a kid can act like this. I'm sure there are kids this messed up, but they probably have far less attentive parents. My problem with this film is that in a town as small as the one they live in, how could no one besides Wood's character see Henry pulling these dangerous pranks? The movie really loses its credibility in the last 20 minutes, when Henry's true intentions come to light by way of (and I am not making this up) a rubber duckie! It goes without saying that when the favorite bath toy of Ernie from Sesame Street is the primary motive for Henry's madness, there is just no room for method.After that part, the climactic show-down is just entirely contrived, not to mention hokey and completely stupid! The voice over at the end then leaves the movie on such a questionable note that it's incredibly unbelievable that the movie was made in the first place.It was one of the MPAA's smartest moves to rate this movie R, but it was absolutely wrong, not to mention immoral, of the production company to market Culkin as much as they did. It's a dark film, but that's really all it is. It could have been so much better, and if someone else beside Culkin (and maybe Wood too) had been cast in it, the intended audience of this film would not have been distracted. My guess is, however, that 20th Century Fox, who released this movie, worried less about an audience and more about money. They probably didn't care that some parents managed to succumb to their kids' demands to see this movie, and probably regretted it later.

Mark's father Jack (David Morse) has to go away for a two week business trip to Tokyo shortly after his wife's death. Thinking that the blustery Maine environment will do him good, he drops Mark off with the family of his Uncle Wallace (Daniel High Kelly). At first, Mark is withdrawn, but soon he begins to warm to his Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson), his cousin Connie (Quinn Culkin), and particularly his cousin Henry (Macauley Culkin). Mark and Henry pal around together, but Mark begins to notice some of Henry's ideas of fun differ significantly from his own. For example, Henry demonstrates his homemade crossbow by killing the neighbor's pet, and shows Mark his dummy (called Mr. Highway) that he drops from an overpass onto a highway, causing a big car pileup. Mark begins to suspect that the death of Henry's baby brother wasn't an accident, and it appears Henry is now making plans to kill his sister. But when Mark tries to warn Henry's parents of their son's homicidal tendencies, they refuse to listen to him. The Good Son got bashed a little and understandably so, Culkin wasn't the best choice for this, but I hear he was forced into this role by his father so you can't blame Macauley that much. I thought the Good Son was still decent entertainment, but could have been so much better if the cast was a little different.

So it was perfectly fitting that he play an evil boy who is obsessed with violence and death. A semi-remake of The Bad Seed, Culkin does his best at being terrifying and even says his first on-screen f**k (Don't f**k with me!), but falls short too many times to be believable. Elijah Wood steals the show, an accomplished actor as a character who is taken from one desperate situation (his mother has just recently died) and thrown into another (trapped in a house with his psychotic cousin). He has more scenes than Culkin, steals every scene from Culkin, and is a very likable character. The same can't be said for Culkin, who if anything annoys the viewer. Word has it that he only got this role because his crazy father blackmailed FOX by saying Culkin wouldn't make Home Alone 2 until he made The Good Son. Culkin does seem very out-of-place and uncomfortable in some scenes, letting us know that his forte is comedy, not horror. A few good chilling scenes (the frantic skating on the lake, the cliff-hanging (literally) finale), but overall, nothing to shout about. Culkin's sister plays Culkin's sister and Culkin's brother plays Culkin's dead brother in a picture, if you care.

One of his cousins is a boy his age, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). Henry turns out to be a psychopath and is determined to do anything to stop Mark from telling anyone else.This movie originally had a different director attached to it who (understandably) did not want Culkin in it. Culkins' father made it clear that if Macaulay didn't get this movie he wouldn't do Home Alone 2. So, the studio bowed to pressure--the original director quit--and Culkin destroys what could have been a great movie. As we now know, Macaulay was treated like dirt by his father and forced into projects, so he can't be blamed for this entirely. Still he's just lousy. He says all his lines in a monotone and has a blank look on his face all through the movie. He really weighs this movie down. Still, this isn't totally worthless.It's well-directed; contains three very good performances by Wood, Wendy Crewson and David Morse; has just beautiful locations (most filmed in Cape Ann, MA) and has a lush, sweeping music score. Also it seems to have been cut down to its bare bones--it's only 84 minutes long--and moves very quickly.Still, I can only give it a 6 because of Culkin.

I don't mean anything legit, just an entertaining movie to watch one evening. Siskel and Ebert panned this wondering why it was made and how it could be considered even remotely entertaining. The first reason why it is entertaining is because Macaulay Culkin's character is simply evil. There's lots of psychopaths in the world much like Culkin who were simply born that way. So in a way, this is a good sketch of a psycho. The second (and probably the biggest) reason this is entertaining is because Macaulay Culkin plays his most chilling role to date. Unlike Party Monster which had him playing a similar role, The Good Son was around the time he was doing The Pagemaster and Richie Rich--when he was still on top. Seeing somebody pull off a completely different role is always a ton of fun to see. Culkin happens to play an insane villain, so it may come as a bigger shock to, say, Jim Carrey in The Truman Show.Elijah Wood plays the protagonist named Mark who's mother just died and is sent to live with his relatives for a few weeks after his father (Morse) is sent away on business. At first, he and cousin Henry (Culkin) have fun, but soon sees what Henry is really about. Nobody believes Mark, but he must reveal Henry before his father comes to get him. The character of Henry is your classical case of a a naturally evil human smart, cunning, manipulative, and senseless. And Culkin steals all the scenes he's in. The subplot with Mark and his mother is pretty interesting and it is nice to see it tie in with the main plot. Both Culkin and Wood are dynamite.

Let's tackle them first. Could the directors please decide how much snow was on the ground. One minute it was fairly deep snow even in the woods. The next scene you saw mostly grass. It became so inconsistent that it actually bothered and distracted me. Would parents really allow a boy to have a tree house quite as precarious as the one shown? The third issue I had was with the physicality of the conclusion. I do not believe a normal human could have not fallen all the way down off the cliff. I do not believe an average woman could have climbed back up the cliff.Okay, so those are the problem around which you must suspend belief. But then again, how many are out there where you don't have to suspend belief? So, that's okay.I suppose there are people who wonder if any 12 year old could be as intellectually evil as Henry. As a retired principal of a junior high/middle school, let me assure that in that regard this film is not that much of a stretch.I think this film is a great thriller. It shows how helpless children can be when adults don't listen. It shows how even at a young age a mind can be terribly messed up.Elijah Wood is top notch here in his child-actor years. Too bad he hasn't remained as cute as he was back then, but then again he's done okay with an estimated net worth of $30 million. Macaulay Culkin turns in a truly creepy performance, although not as creepy as the rest of his real life turned out being.Wendy Crewson is very believable as the mom; fine performance. David Morse is one of those dependable character actors that does nicely here in a rather small (though key) role. Same for Jacqueline Brookes -- quite dependable as a character actress; I always enjoyed seeing her on screen.I'm going to give this film an 8, which is unusual for me, but it is so far above the recent crap that has come out as thrillers. This is a winner; forget that Culkin messed up his later life and enjoy him from his brief golden years as a child actor. But you'll probably enjoy Elijah Wood's performance even more.

These kids are pure evil wrapped in the guise of innocence. They can usually get away with whatever they want and no one suspects their cute little angel of being a monster. Even if they are caught, what can anyone really do about it anyway? If that's not frighten enough, think about the fact that every serial killer on earth was at one time a child, and films like The Good Son represent a story that could be happening right now. The film begins when young Mark (Elijah Wood) losses his mother in a traffic accident. Mark's father is so distraught that he needs some time to himself and sends his son to live with his brother's family in the country. Both families think it will be good for Mark to be around someone his own age, his cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin), but what they didn't know is that Henry is pure evil and has killed before. We see stories like this from time to time, but never one that is so realistic. When you think Killer Kids, movies like The Omen come to mind, but this is different as Henry isn't possessed, he's just a psychopath. This was Macaulay Culkin's first role after Home Alone and he is beyond terrific. At his age, Culkin is asked to play two roles, the innocent kid with the face of an angel and the demented psycho with the heart of the devil. How a pre-teen, who'd only been in two films prior, could accomplish such a feat, is nothing short of astounding. Elijah Wood is also great, showing that some people are just naturally talented. I've seen Wood in dozen's of things since The Good Son and his eyes still creep me out, it's almost like he can see right through you, and that might have made him a better choice to play Henry. While Wood might have had the look, you'd be hard pressed to find any kid who could do a better job than Culkin did here. The Good Son is mysterious, creepy, and a whole lot of fun to watch.

He is obsessed with death and may have killed his little brother.This was big news to see young Macaulay Culkin play a bad guy. He shows that he has great range as a child actor. I just think that the movie works better as a straight up horror. Director Joseph Ruben who just filmed 'Sleeping with the Enemy' is using a similar style. This has a little too much of that movie-of-the-week feel. There is a good creepiness about this but that's all Ruben achieves. Every adult is an idiot and the movie strains under that construction. Why doesn't Mark call his father again? Why doesn't the father call the psychiatrist? The movie bends over backwards to come up with that ending. I don't have a problem with evil kids in horror. It's a try and true subject, but this is not a good example. "},{"Title":"Macaulay is a PSYCHO!!!

Mark and his father, Jack (David Morse) are both saddened by this, but Jack has some important business in Tokyo. So he decides to leave Mark in the care of Mark's Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) and Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly). Mark quickly becomes friends with his cousins Henry (Macaulay Culkin) and Connie (Quinn Culkin).After staying in their home for a while Mark starts to notice that Henry just might be somewhat demented. Henry acts strangely, creates weapons, and almost drops Mark from, what seems to be, the world's highest tree house. Mark tries telling the adults, but (as always) they refuse to believe him. Henry even finds ways to make Mark seem like the insane child.This movie was enjoyable to see, because I think the world was tired of seeing Macaulay Culkin as just the typical child actor, who plays pranks on people. In The Good Son he tries to murder people. That's very uncommon when it comes to child actors. Elijah Wood also did a great job as Mark. He and Macaulay did a great job working with each other.This movie really made you think of Macaulay as this really creepy little kid. He goes on to do horrible things, throughout the movie. Henry went ahead and did whatever made him happy. He caused a very destructive car accident, by throwing a dummy into traffic. He also takes this weird gun thing that shoots screws or nails, which he created, and kills a dog. He even tried to drown his little sister, in a frozen lake. He didn't feel any remorse at all when he did these things; he just had this creepy little smirk (like in Home Alone).Elijah Wood was perfect for the part of Mark. He looks like the most innocent child in the world. And was the last person you would expect to see try to stop Henry. Mark seemed innocent, but when it was necessary he put up a good fight against Henry (Not as good as he did in Sin City, but pretty good).What I found disappointing about the movie is that the parents never realized something was wrong with Henry. They shouldn't have needed Mark telling them. They live with him they should've noticed that he was a sick twisted little child, who was pure evil.I also didn't like the fact that Mark's father went to Tokyo right after his wife died. He didn't even seem that sad about it. But he should've put more consideration into how his son might be feeling at a time like that.Overall it was a good movie, despite the horrible parenting. It was great to see Macaulay Culkin take on a new type of role. It was just as great to see a counterpart as good as Elijah Wood.3 out of 5 stars "},{"Title":"I totally Disagree","Date":"28 July 2007","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" That's some Bull.

This increases the immersion & effect of the movie & its characters.I've seen this movie quite a few times but macs good performance still keeps on reminding me that these kinda kids exist and this is why good psychologists are needed.Wood performs very well especially with the genuine tears & lively acting. One would argue that he outshines Macs performance but I disagree, they both complement each others good acting and work with great synergy. The Good Son is a strong movie, what elevates this fact is the landscape imagery and portrayals of the beautiful surroundings in different states on the car trip to the mansion.People should not rate this movie too harshly(IMDb scale, should be a 7-8) based on its child actors but more on its contents. Afterall, the actors could be anybody, but the movies heart would stay the same. The movie tries to show us how a psychological conduct disorder can manifest itself age -independent and how hard it is to realize the disorder before there is damage done by these individuals.This movie gets compared a lot to a movie called ''Bad Seed'' and i don't there should even exist an attempt to directly compare and judge ''The Good Son'''s quality as a movie based on the first one quoted. The truth is that these movies are certainly different.Again, I safely recommend this movie as one of the best movies for intelligent & observant people, interested in psychology.

The excellent child actor, Elijah Wood, was thrown into this Culkin star-vehicle(with his sister and brother also having cameos) as the good kid that no-one believes and he's fine in the movie. Culkin and the story, though, are predictable -- as I said before. Sure, he can play evil, but we knew that from the Home Alone movies. The title is kind of confusing because the movie is about a child(who is not a son), played by Wood, who's mother dies and he has to live with a cousin while he's away on a business trip. The kids play like mischievous young boys initially and then the Culkin character kills a neighborhood dog with a rigged together gun and everything begins to fall apart. Woods' character then starts suspecting that the Culkin character is going to take out everyone that's left one by one(as he did his younger son) and he starts trying to do that. The Culkin character tries to pretend that the Wood character is the confused one and gets a few adults to believe him but the mother eventually figures everything out.

Ruben does an adequate job directing, but the one that really shines in this film is Woods, playing the young boy scared for the life of himself and his adopted family. When his character gets scared, you can really see the fear in his eyes. It is apparent when this film begins, that one of the child actors has a future ahead of him.Culkin on the other hand, is sub-par. He carries out the character well, but he shows little emotion for what he is doing. He just seems to amble from scene to scene, mumbling his lines, and looking serious. And when he looks serious, he looks goofy.There are several intense and suspenseful scenes, but all in all, the film does little to scare.

The Good Son is about Mark (Elijah Wood), a young child who recently lost his mother to cancer. During the winter break, Mark goes to stay with his aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson), his uncle, and cousins at their large seaside house on the chilly coastline of Maine. The oldest son, Henry (Macauly Culkin) befriends Mark and the two become fairly good pals. But Mark begins to become suspicious about Henry's true self when he begins to display murderous intentions, especially toward his younger sister. Not to mention that Henry's infant brother drowned under mysterious circumstances a year earlier. With nobody willing to believe Mark (dismissing him as a troubled boy who is suffering the loss of his mother), he finds himself responsible to stop Henry from trying to take the lives of his family and reveal the true dark side of his manipulative sociopathic personality.An intriguing thriller in the vein of the 1956 horror film The Bad Seed, The Good Son is a very smart and inventive horror/thriller. The plot is really interesting and I liked the film's set up to begin with. There aren't many movies out there dealing with psychotic children, so seeing this is really interesting and refreshing. The main characters are children, so the actors who play these characters need to be believable enough to carry the film, and both Culkin and Wood achieve this very easily. The supporting cast consisted mainly of Wendy Crewson as Henry's mother (who is also very good) and Culkin's real life little sister, playing his little sister on screen. The cinematography in the film is very nice, and the cold, rocky, gray-toned Maine landscape benefits to the film's overall atmosphere and gives it a very dark and menacing feel.The suspense factor is very strong. It builds up fairly slowly until the finale, which is a real cliff-hanger, literally. There are some pretty eerie sequences in the film that will have you on the edge of your seat (especially the hide-and-go-seek game in the pitch-black house that takes place between the kids). Culkin brings the evil character to life, and does it well. After seeing him in his sweet role in the Home Alone films, this is quite a contrast, but he proves that he can play versatile characters. His character is probably the most interesting thing about this movie, and the film is really just an insight into the mind of psychotic children. We know he's evil, we don't know when he's going to strike, but we know that nobody knows about his true evil self besides Mark. The character study is very interesting and the chemistry between the two is great.Overall, The Good Son is an excellent thriller that won't disappoint you. It has plenty of suspense, some great shock moments, breathtaking cinematography, and all-around good acting. Not to mention the very good (and believable) writing also. Definitely recommended, one of the better thrillers you'll find out there. 8/10.

As it is, it's just a rather uneven, suspense-free misfire with the added flaw that it's also in howling bad taste. Elijah Wood plays a young boy who has to spend a few weeks at his aunt's house. Here he befriends his teenaged cousin (Macauley Culkin) and the two of them are soon up to the usual pranks that young boys entertain themselves with. However, Wood gradually learns that Culkin's pranks are neither good natured nor harmless - in fact, the teenaged tearaway is a raging psychopath who gets a buzz from his acts of cruelty. Just as Wood prepares to tell his aunt the truth, Culkin realises that his sadistic secret is out, so he issues young Elijah with a stern ultimatum - tell anyone the truth and you're dead....literally! Culkin is very unconvincing as a teenaged murderer, but that's not the biggest flaw with this thriller. As mentioned earlier, it's a very uneven film and this is the main weakness with it. It starts out as a nostalgic look at mischievous youth but suddenly turns very nasty. The change of tone causes all kinds of problems 1. It makes the film seem terribly jarring; 2. it renders the events in the film's first half pointless; 3. it transforms the film from a drama rooted in reality to an unbelievable and over-the-top melodrama; and 4. it makes the structure of the film seem clumsy and amateurish.

One of the best ever!","Date":"24 November 2012","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" One of the best things about being a Horror freak is discovering these little Easter egg surprises in old films. This time, I had the pleasure of finding Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood as little kids, playing in one of the most disturbing, unnerving and well made Thrillers I've ever seen.Not using any cheats at all (I mean none - no sudden loud music that would force the audience to jump, no nude shots, no cellphone without a battery or signal and no cars that won't start), The Good Son derived its Horror aspect from pure reality. There's nothing supernatural or involving esoteric theories. Just a blunt and slightly exaggerated case of Psychopathy in children. Good ol' fashion uneasy horror!The acting is wonderful and almost flawless! David Morse (Mark's father Jack) and Daniel Hugh Kelly's characters weren't given enough screen time to really have depth, and I found Morse's acting to be slightly unconvincing (he didn't really make me feel like he was a recently widowed father). Besides that - nothing but praises. Wendy Crewson was excellent as Susan Evans, little Quinn Culkin (Macaulay's sister) was quite impressive as Connie Evans (especially the pond scene, that took some talent and probably lots of practice), and Jacqueline Brookes really managed to portray the elderly kind-hearted and empathetic psychiatrist Alice Devenport. As for the two stars - Elijah Wood seemed to have been made for the role of Mark, the kid who had recently lost his mother. His big round eyes, when wearing a sad expression, are a secret weapon for any director. His laughter immediately made me think of his role as Frodo Baggins, and reminded me of his great talent of depicting the full spectrum of emotions (although for that one must also bear in mind his role as the cannibal killer in Sin City). And for the grand finale - Macaulay Culkin. Dear God, I'll never be able to view Home Alone/Richi Rich/The Pagemaster the same way! Talk about a talented kid actor with many faces... Culkin's acting as evil Sociopath non-caring Henry Evans was creepy and disturbing to the point of being truly horrific! Try to count how many time he really smiled, and in which situations. Macaulay Culkin was the single most disturbing evil child I've seen so far, more that any of the Children of the Corn or The Children cast.The story was also profound, and the events that described Mark's relationship with Henry were realistic, reasonable, clear and horrifying. None of the scenes felt redundant or forced in any way, and some of them were as sad and touching as the others were creepy and bone chilling. My only slight small problem was the with the final scene. Without giving any spoilers, it simply felt unrealistic and I didn't think it could happen that way in real life. Though you might disagree.All in all - I don't think I have anything bad to say about this film. I'd have given it a 10 had I not felt biased due to Culkin and Wood's other roles which I've seen prior to this film. However, even if you haven't seen any of them in action before - if you're a Children Horror/Thriller fan you simply cannot let yourself pass on this one. Extremely highly recommended!

It was very interesting to see a modern thriller that felt more like a classic Hitchcock tale than 'Die Hard'.The Good Son has very little violence directly on the screen, and is far more interested in implying danger and violence, which is ultimately far more effective. No matter how graphic a scene is, it's never quite as scary or thrilling as what 'could' be. By merely implying the violence, and hiding it away from the audience, we feel just as trapped and helpless as the main star.In the end, The Good Son was quite impressive, and although it's not always realistic, neither was Psycho, and when you consider the fact that all the main actors are children, it's downright impressive how good a performance each of them brought to this competent thriller.

Still, it's no kid movie. .","Date":"2 August 2013","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" This movie is one of my guilty pleasure. I just love the inner battle between two of the best child actors of the 1990's. Both, Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Woods are wonderful in the roles, they play in this film. Some critics might hate this movie because of the controversy of having the 1990's Home Alone play such an evil role. I didn't mind, because it's shows how great Macaulay Culkin can act. Who knew that the Home Alone kid could be so creepy? And the horrid part is that he looked so natural playing a scheming, serial-killing kid. Directed by Joseph Ruben, the movie starts with 12-year-old Mark Evan (Elijah Wood) having to move to Maine to stay with his Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) after one of his parents has die, and the other is on an oversea trip. While, there he meets with their son, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). They slowly become good friends, but after a series of sinister acts by Henry, Mark starts to question their friendship as he thinks that Henry might be more dangerous than what he seems. Too bad, that none of the adults believe him. Elijah Wood is just amazing actor when he was younger. He is a winner early on in his career and the proof is in this role. His eyes convey such fear and concern that you really feel his performance is for real. The two stars have great chemistry together. They work with each other so well, I thought this story could have been a real life story. Trust me, why the movie might not seem real. I heard news stories of very evil children doing awful things to each other, without the adults knowing. So it's not so far fetch like some critics panned it to be. The settling in Maine, makes it seem like the movie was written by Stephen King. Surprising it wasn't. A tie-in novel was published alongside the movie's release in 1993, written by Todd Strasser. That explain more about Henry's backstory. The book also concludes differently from the movie that interesting to read. The screen writing by Ian McEwan might be a bit over the top and pretty exaggerated in the film. Even if a child is a sociopath, it still has a child's vocabulary, intelligence, etc. Just being a sociopath doesn't mean you sound like Hannibal Lecter right from the womb. Also, they tend to master the art of acting and sounding normal, which is how they make their way through life without people cluing in. Granted Henry is pretty young and may not have learned those skills yet, but this movie really stretches reality with how obviously unsettled he is and the fact that even people trained to recognize a disturbed child can't see him. The actions he did doesn't seem too far from what an evil child might have done. It's hammed up, but it's no different from any other evil bad seed film like 2009's Orphan and 1956's Bad Seed. Yes, the film was inappropriate for children, but it never was for kids. It's a thriller, and a scary movie. So for Robert Ebert to call the film a creepy, unpleasant experience. I think the movie did its purpose. It's not supposed to make you feel lovely, it's a horror movie. I don't understand why people think this movie is any different than other horror films. At less, this horror movie was smart. I love the final action scene at the end of the cliffs. In my opinion, it's one of my favorite fight scenes in the 1990s. It's get more intense, when a hard choice was given to one of the main characters. I wouldn't spoil it for you. The music by Elmer Bernstein was chilling and works for the intense moments. In my opinion, this R film isn't that bad. Yes, it has children fighting, harsh language, and smoking, but it's not as gory as 1984's Children of the Corn, and 1976's the Omen. This movie could had been rated PG-13 with a few edits. The DVD transfer is good. So it's worth finding this movie, it's has a lot of DVD extras worth checking out. Overall This film isn't for the faint of heart conservative watchers. You have to open to anything, even if it's seems odd for a child to act this way. Once you get pass that, you will realize that this movie isn't as bad as what some critics say it is. You find yourself, cheering Elijah Wood on with this thriller as the story takes you in. You find out that the film is badly overlook and panned by critics just angry because at the time Culkin was American darling at the time and they believe that he shouldn't play a bad seed at the time. It's like watching 1930's horror movie with Shirley Temple as an evil daughter. People are just typecasting the child actor to only family friendly roles. The Good Son is a rare gem of a horror movie that needs to be check out again. It's a good movie, and it's good enough for me.

It was just very disturbing to see him in this kind of role, playing as an evil kid no one but his cousin suspected evil.This movie, I thought, was both good and bad. The good points about it was the plot and how both the actors, Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin acted in it as good and evil. I thought they were excellent as children. They said their lines as how their character would say it and they really got into it. However, the bad points were how Macaulay Culkin had to play an evil little killer, some of the scripts, ratings, and ending. In one part, Mark Evans (Elijah) tells Henry (Mac) that his mother's soul is in Henry's mom. I thought that was completely stupid, because it sounds like possession, not as though cute and grief-stricken. And how Henry used a cigarette and cursed Don't f*ck with me, I was shocked. Why let him say that? Now that really surprised me.The movie is rated R. Why? Because of violence and language. Well, I only counted one cursing, but that's it. The violence was off-screen, so the movie should have been rated PG-13 or at least PG.The ending made me so mad, because Susan (Henry's mom) had to let go of one child when she was holding onto them at the edge of the cliff. I know it was right of her to let go of Henry, but did they have to make that scene? After that, I cried because no matter how evil that child was, it was sad to know he died so young.

I was watching A&E and I saw an ad for it, so I decided to give it a chance. The first like, 20 minutes of the movie were somewhat boring, but I left my TV on, and the movie caught my attention again when it got to the part where Mark almost fell out of Henry's tree fort.At that point, I began watching it again, and the rest of the movie was pretty good! Strangely enough though, the first time I saw the movie, I didn't even know that Elijah Wood played Mark, even though he is an actor that I really liked from seeing him in The Lord Of The Rings and stuff. But later that night, the same movie came on again, and I noticed how well he did. McCauly Culkin did a pretty good job too. I remember seeing him in the Home Alone' movies when I was a bit younger. It's kind of funny how his little sister played his actual sister in the movie, and his little brother was in it too.Basically this movie is about a boy named Mark (Elijah Wood) who finds out from his father that his mom is dying from cancer in the hospital. After having a few last words with her, she passes away, and Mark goes to stay with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan, and his two cousins Henry (McCauly Culkin) and Connie (Quinn Culkin.) At first Mark and Henry have lots of fun together, but after a while, Mark notices something about his cousin. Although nobody except Mark realizes it, Henry is actually evil and does all kinds of bad things. He kills a dog by shooting it with a steel bolt, drops a dummy onto the highway causing a huge collision, tries to drown his little sister, poison his family's food, and lots more, but nobody seems to even notice. They all think Henry is the perfect child. When Mark tries to tell His Aunt and Uncle, and even his Dad, everyone thinks he's crazy. One day when Henry's mom takes him for a little walk to question him about his little brother Richard's death, he pushes her off a cliff, and is just about to drop a big boulder onto her when Mark runs up and knocks it away from him. The two begin fighting by the edge of the cliff, while Susan manages to climb back up. Then the two boys roll off the edge and Susan grabs each of them by their arm. She knew she could only save one, and let her evil son drop into the rocky bay below.I guess all in all The Good Son was a fairly good movie.

It is artistic in displaying Henry's attraction to violence, how no one had ever picked up on his mental deficiency, and how it is already to late.

After a violent hap with Caulkin's character, Elijah's character must warn his new aunt/mom about Caulkin's character's show of no emotions and violent tendencies.This movie is, in my opinion, a great movie, but not one of the best.

It got sandwiched between two movies that I do like on the same cassette, so I never taped over it.Like a lot of people recently, I've been digging out stuff that Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and John Rhys-Davies were in before LOTR. I gave this movie another go...and I was amazed. Mac is just pulling the strings, but Elijah WAS his character! He shows so much of the vulnerability, determination and nerve that he does as Frodo! And I swear he doesn't look a day older now!That said, however, this movie is just too pat. Everything's set up so that there are no obstacles to Henry's plans, and there's no way for Mark to succeed in foiling him. The last third of the film moves too fast, without enough connection between events.Start with Henry saying, What are you gonna do? Watch her all night? Cut to Mark waking up on the floor next to Connie's bed in broad daylight. So he did stay there all night. But that plays like the punchline to a joke. What did he really do? Did he TELL Connie he was going to stay there? If he had, then he would also have told her WHY he was doing it. Then she would have thought twice before going skating with Henry. Or if he didn't tell her, then when she woke up, she would have said, Eek! Mark's in my room! Then the parents would have charged in, thinking HE was the one with evil intentions. But that still would have put a crimp in Henry's plans, or at least Mark would have known where they were going. The way it plays out just makes no sense. And the mom never really believes Mark until Henry tries to kill *her*. And it's because of her, not Mark, that Henry dies.

The subject of 'The Good Son' is kind of disturbing and also somewhat unrealistic.The plot is basically as follows. Elijah Wood plays a young boy who's mother died and his father leaves him with his uncle and his wife's house in Maine. There he befriends his cousin, played by Macaulay Culkin. Soon Wood discovers his cousin's homicidal tendencies (kills a dog, causes a pile-up, etc.). It comes to a whole new level when Wood finds out Culkin's character killed his baby brother several years ago, and plans to kill his younger sister. He threatens to tell his aunt and uncle, but Culkin makes it clear he won't allow that.Overall, 'The Good Son,' is an average thriller. Some chills here and there and a decent climax, but the film has many flaws. First, the script isn't that great, and the dialogue is unrealistic (esp. Macaulay's character, which seems more like an philosophical serial killer than a disturbed child). The plot itself is unrealistic (I doubt there have been very many homicidal children). The acting is also mediocre, neither of the leads show any real talent in their roles.My biggest problem with this film is that it's subject matter is extremely disturbing. Who really wants to see a movie where a young boy - that could be their son, nephew, grandson, etc. - kill off his siblings? I'd have to wonder what disturbed minds in Hollywood thought out this film. I could've probably forgiven this film's poorly thought-ought plot, had everything else about the film been good.Want to see a great thriller? Check out Hitchcock or something along the lines of 'The Sixth Sense.'

He plays a bad seed son, and his cousin warns people but no one believes him.I didn't really find this to be a good film, since it feels there's about a half hour or so missing. Culkin's mom gets suspicious without enough evidence really, and his parents never really have it sink in (the father remains clueless the entire film).However, if you view this film to see Culkin act like a very disturbing kid, and to see him say lines like don't f**k with me, it's a pretty funny movie. When he casually takes out a cigarette and starts puffing, what can I say, it was hilarious. Watching him play dumb and dead-pan his way through situations to avoid being suspected of wrongdoing makes for great laughs.Even Elijah Wood has his share of funny scenes, with his bulging eyes and acting crazy (the food massacre scene is great). And his trading barbs with Culkin's Henry is decent.They do a good job, it's just that the film again, really isn't good so you have to enjoy it for what it turned out to be, an unintentionally hilarious romp for Culkin.

Most of these could be easily categorised by the type of person who was the villain, i.e. 'bad cop' (UNLAWFUL ENTRY), 'bad neighbour' (PACIFIC HEIGHTS), 'bad husband' (SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY). THE GOOD SON is, as you'd guess from the title, about a bad kid.Said kid is Macauley Culkin, a wonderful piece of casting against type by the producers. So long we've had to put up with Culkin in his sickly-sweet roles but here he portrays somebody very different indeed and, inevitably, this turns out to be the best performance of his career. Culkin is excellent, truly portraying a character beyond his years, and he helps to make the movie.It helps that everything else is right, too. The script focuses on realism throughout, and there's plenty of characterisation to make the viewer feel truly grounded in the experience. Aside from the ending, things don't get over the top with the style or direction. There are a handful of set-pieces which really work (like the bit with the bridge), and some incredible stunt work that left me breathless, like the whole bit with the tree house. As somebody with a fear of heights, such moments turned my legs to jelly.Elijah Wood made a point of appearing in plenty of twee kid's films during the 1990s (FREE WILLY anyone?) but this is one of his most interesting movies from that decade. David Morse is typically good as Wood's father. The script stays grounded throughout, the psychological insight is as interesting as the thriller aspects of the story, and it all finishes in a satisfying way that goes against Hollywood convention. Good stuff.

On one side he appears to be a reasonably good boy who occasionally gets into trouble, but deep down, he is wickedly evil. We explore the psyche of the good son, Henry (MacCauly Culkin), through the eyes of the child Mark (Elijah Woods). Mark recently lost his mother, but his father had to go to Tokyo to conduct a business deal. He arranged to leave Mark with his brother while he was away, and thus Mark came to know his cousin Henry.The first time you glimpse the evil of Henry is when Mark slips and Henry grabs him and says If I let go, do you think you could fly. This statement is important for it shows us the nature of Henry. He says that he came to realise that there were no boundaries and thus you could do anything. He kills animals without remorse, but this is nothing compared to what he does with Mr Highway.This movie tries to question what evil is, and if it exists. Henry is definitely evil, but also incredibly intelligent. His intelligence is what makes him evil for he is able to manipulate the situation so that he is always in control. Yet he is not for there is a essence of doubt in his mother's mind, and it is this doubt the slowly reveals Henry to be what it is.The Good Son has the makings of a brilliant movie with brilliant themes, yet it is not there. I knew that Henry was responsible for his brother Richard's death, and it was not a surprise when the evidence arose. There was a rubber duck which plays an important role in the movie, but only exists for a few minutes. Henry's character is brilliant, but the ideas and the images in the movie don't exist. They speak of flying twice in the movie, yet it seems to be major aspect of Henry's evil nature. This movie was not suspenseful, nor did the plot twist. It was open and predictable and probably only good to watch once and forget. I would not even suggest this movie for die hard Macauly Culkin fans for his character is incredibly different than he is in his other movies, such as Home Alone I & II.

Now, if this was a recent movie it would be a much more believable film, seeing that Elijah Wood (let's face it here) mostly plays wussies and Macaulay Culkin, well... looks like a psychopath. But this movie came out in 1993, thus Elijah was about twelve and Culkin about 13 years old (even though he still looks like he's going to put his hands on his cheeks and deliver an over the top scream at any moment throughout the whole film), so you can imagine how that works. It doesn't, I would say if it didn't, but it strangely does.Now, don't get me wrong, I was never really frightened by Culkin in this movie, but firstly whoever expects of someone to make Macaulay Culkin look bad ass, has a big freaking faith in mankind and secondly Joseph Ruben manages to make him at least a little intimidating throughout most of the movie (you have to give him credit for that, whoever that guy is) and by most of the movie I mean roughly the first half. But I think that's because of the human nature. Man, at some point had to realize that this guy who threatened to pull down his loincloth all the time was just a plastic puppet, made by big Hollywood corporations to make money. In other words; at some point in the movie that varies from human to human Macaulay Culkin stops looking intimidating and just starts to annoy the f**k out of you, until you just want to strangle him to death. And you know why? Because you CAN! For granted if you showed this movie to a six-year-old, he will most likely get scared, but anyone older than eleven is just too much. I mean what would you do if Macaulay Culkin just came over to your house trying to play sick games with you? That's right! You would give him a punch in his god damned face and that would most certainly shut him up for good. So, I'm sorry for talking about Culkin for so long but it just has got to be addressed what a miscast this is. Giving a boy who's one and only strength is to look cutesy in front of the camera a role in which he has to do anything BUT looking cutesy in front of the camera is something that should be reconsidered before you wake up after a long night with various contract assignments nobody can remember and you notice it's too late.So how about that Elijah Wood guy? I heard he was in this movie too! Well he is and he is our main hero. The whole story is told from his point of view (which left many people to think that in fact Macaulay Culkin was the good son and Wood just changed the story to his advantage, although the writer never confirmed it and there would be some plot holes if this was the case) and he's pretty good in his role. He's not great, but he sure as hell is not bad. He's supposed to be the innocent one, who gets drawn into the s**t Culkin produces, but oddly enough he has his psycho moments too. I won't spoil it for you, but you will definitely know which scenes I mean once you get there. He is kind of shallow, but you still care for him. Nothing more to say than a nice main character, but nothing more.Okay, now on to the story. I can imagine that writer and great novelist Ian McEwan did not have the face of Richie Rich in mind when he wrote the script, so I guess he did a great job. The ones who screwed it up in that part were the filmmakers. This could have been a real gripping and horrifying movie, but instead they just went up to the first hobo they saw on the highway who did not have a shotgun with him. I think Ian deserved better, because he couldn't have known that the cigarette would be smoked by every momma's dream Culkin and would become my wallpaper for the next five years.So anyway, the story itself had real great potential, mainly the ending is really good and it actually did translate well to film, but it has some things to it that stand in the way for a real coherent movie experience. For what it is you get a good, entertaining movie, that's neither too short nor too long and that's while not being gripping throughout the whole movie partially really intense. I'd say give it a watch!

Similar films include The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and Sleeping With The Enemy. Macaulay Culkin, fresh from doing two Home Alone films which made him famous Home Alone 1990 and Home Alone 2 Lost In New York (1992), flexes his versatile acting muscles in the role of a maladjusted, duplicitous, murderous son, Henry. Elijah Wood plays Mark Evans, the good son, whose lost his mother to cancer. He is sent away to live with his uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan. Their son Richard dies mysteriously in the bathtub. Initially, Mark and Henry get along and become playmates. But Henry has twisted ideas of fun, such as threatening to throw Mark from the top of a high tree house, throwing a dummy Mr. Highway from an overpass into a highway, killing the neighbor's dog with a crossbow. Eventually, Henry confesses to Mark that he killed Richard in the bathtub, jealous that the parents were spending more attention to him. When Henry's sister Connie nearly suffers the same fate, Mark tells Wallace and Susan that Henry is not the innocent, sweet boy they think he is. They don't believe Mark as they believe he's only acting out his frustrations after his mother's death. But Susan discovers the rubber duckie that was lost the night of Richard's bathtub death, proving that Henry is the possible killer. There is much to admire about this disturbing film about sibling rivalry. The cinematography is a mixture of gorgeous seaside landscapes with steep cliffs, as if to represent the precarious and wild nature of Henry. The secret tree house is a corruption of his childhood. The music by Elmer Bernstein is effectively dramatic and dissonant in the right moments. Even if at the end of the day, this film is typical of the thriller-trash prevalent of films of the early 90's, it is still highly dramatic and compelling. Look for Macaulay Culkin's own siblings- Quinn Culkin who played Connie and Rory Culkin who played Richard- make cameos. The climax comes on in the end, when Susan must decide what son to save from death, this coming after the discovery of her own biological son's evil nature. This film is rated R, and should not be viewed by young children. The film borders on sensationalism but Macaulay Culkin does a fine job at his age and the nightmarish movie does evoke a haunting what if premise. 10 stars well deserved.

Culkin just doesn't have the acting chops to pull it off. Wood might have been able to, but not Culkin. And you'll notice who's a big star today and who has disappeared from sight. Need I say more? Enjoy SON for Wood's very believable performance and Rubin's steady hand at the directorial wheel.

He plays most of his role in an expressionless manner that is supposed to give the audience the subtle impression that he is a cold-blooded killer.This may have served adult actors like ALAN LADD well when they handled grim material with those expressionless steely-eyed glances and tight lips, but Caulkin merely looks like an angelic child going through the paces of pretending to mean every word of his dialog. He never changes that sweet choir boy look, even when he is about to pounce like a predator. It undermines any dramatic tension the scene should have.On the other hand, some genuine acting is offered by eleven year-old ELIJAH WOOD, as the visiting cousin who gradually comes to see that his cousin is not the good son he's pretending to be. The biggest rift comes when he unwittingly joins in the fun of carrying a dummy to a bridge overpass which Macaulay then dumps onto the highway below, causing a pile-up of crashing cars on the speeding lanes.After this, the theme darkens as the boy becomes aware that deep seated jealousy is causing his cousin to destroy some of the people close to him. The next victim is Macaulay's younger sister, playfully tossed onto the danger zone of an ice-skating pond, falling and getting no help from him until rescuers cut through the ice.The final section of the film concerns the mother's awareness that something is definitely wrong when she enters the boy's playhouse and finds evidence that he was hiding from her with relation to another accidental drowning.But the film's big set piece is the cliffhanger of a climax, photographed with great dexterity from helicopters giving aerial shots of the steep cliff and the drop below. It's a stunning and fitting climax to a film that is paced a little too slowly despite its brief running time and must have required some skillful stunt work.This doesn't have the sting of other stories about child psychopaths, notably THE BAD SEED, partly because MACAULAY CAULKIN lacks the dramatic skill to really inhabit his role. He was better, of course, in lighter material such as HOME ALONE, but here he is out of his depth in a role that would have been more chilling in the hands of a better qualified and more serious young actor.

This when he meets his cousin Henry who's about the same age. After the first day Mark seems to getting along and enjoying himself, but suddenly everything changes for the worst when he discovers that Henry is a real disturbed little boy who has a tendency for violent behaviour. When Mark tries to convince everyone what Henry really is, Henry pulls the all too sweet and innocent act and so no one we believes him.Tame&#133; yes, this thriller is really uninvolving and tame to the bone. That's not to say it wasn't remotely entertaining even with its shortcomings. Just that it looks like most of the attention went into the glossy set-up than that of the actual material, character depth and building any sort of tension. I also had a hard time believing that of Macaulay Culkin's performance. Sure he was star back in his hey-day, but those Oh look at me I'm so evil expressions was pitiful. He was far from creepy in the role! While his limited acting abilities really showed. Although, that's the opposite for Elijah Wood in his role. He was nothing outstanding, but he made the most of his character. From what I read I hear it borrows elements from the film 'The Bad Seed', but I can't go too much into as I haven't watched it myself. Although this flick I have and I can tell you that the plot starts off like a boy's own adventure. The way it begins you'll be thinking your were watching a different picture when you come to the second half. You'll be asking yourself throughout is this suppose to be a thriller because you won't be biting your finger nails at all, as the flatness of it hits you like a tonne of bricks and the shocks are too few. No real feel of pain or heartache, it's emotionally empty and when it tries hard to be disturbing, it can't hold a candle in the wind in that department. Everything is telegraphed from the twists and turns, where the supposed conflict and mayhem doesn't create any real impact. When it was coming up to the film dying minutes it got all a bit too tiring, but the film's climax is definitely the best moment, if you know what I mean.All the treatment went into the very solid production values, as you definitely will tell. The atmosphere is has a stinging coldness to it and the scenery is simply irresistible, that especially goes to scenes involving the cliffs over looking the sea. Stunning images! What made that evident was professional camera-work with its many spiralling and high crane shots. There was such control and ease throughout. Too bad it had to hit a bad spot with its distracting score, which bellows too much attention by flooding certain moments. The script plods about without any real conviction and makes way for too much chin-wag that doesn't add anything more the picture. The plot basically plays on the Good vs. Evil themes with pretty predictable consequences. There's also moments when the script examines if there's true evil(?), that when you free yourself you take sudden risks without a flinch and blah, blah, yeah there's more to it, but the film might think it's answering that query, but it's far from it. Although it tries for such more, by thinking, lets question ourselves at the end to make sure it looks like there's a deeper meaning to it all&#133; no thank-you! Not bad but not terribly good either.

I had the idea I was watching a thriller for 8-year olds. The whole film is too slick and too easy. Camera work and scenery are fine, but Elmer Bernstein's theme music is really overdone, seems endless and is too prominent all the way through, especially when you take into account that hardly anything happens. A 1950's horror movie is scarier than this! And if anything happens, we can see it coming from miles afar. It's amazing how the characters can't. These characters, by the way, are dreadful stereotypes, lead by Wood, who is highly annoying as the heroic and thoroughly good cousin. He finds himself all alone in believing Culkin forms a threat to his loving, warm family. Let's just hope Ruben is not displaying his own visions on good and bad here, for if so, The Good Son has some rather extreme implications people are simply born 'good' or 'bad'. No wonder Ian McEwan wanted his name removed from the credits.Even if we are to look upon this film as merely entertaining, Ruben did not succeed. The Good Son has little value other than that it features Macaulay Culkin, who -as opposed to the charisma and radiance he displayed in John Hughes' films- does not seem to be enjoying himself at all. If you are going to watch this film, though, do so until it's finished. In the end you may have some good old laughs! (...that is, of course, if the dialogues did not yet cause you to die laughing).

I could never imagine myself being put into such a harrowing situation. The fact that the killer is such a nasty and horrible kid really adds to how horrible it is that nobody believes it when he's told that he's a murderer. What bothers me the most about the film, however, is not the plot and the situations that the characters put themselves in. It is the way the very movie ends. It involves a child being dropped off of a cliff. I will not say which of the two kids dies, nor will I bother to describe the series of events leading up to it. However, the decision involved in the murdering of the child and who has to do it just really freaks me out. I really don't know how on earth I would be able to live with myself if I were a parent and had to go through with what happens at the climax of the film. What bothers me even more about the ending is that, after the child is killed, the music, the tone, and the reactions are totally inappropriate and over-the-top to the situation. I don't think a film has left such a horrible taste in my mouth since MYSTIC RIVER. The climax made me angry and frightened. It left me so angry and frightened that I have a hard time recommending the film to anybody because I don't think even my worst enemies deserve to feel such a bad feeling after a film.

While some may see his lack of emotion in the more intense sequences as bad acting, in truth it's the most intelligent and unnerving decision he (or the director) could make. I thought the subtleties they used to progress the audiences awareness of Culkin's character without fully alienating Wood was very good and kept the viewers attention, however, that did slip a little further into the movie. So, in the end, I really had only one problem with it. The ending. Not because I thought it was boring or anything, I don't think that at all. But I have a problem with inconsistency. And throughout the movie Crewson showed that she was the average mom, in other words she would do anything for her son.

Like many I though he should've chose a better part than this, regardless of how well he pulled it off. The real thing that's scary about this movie is not the chilling performance by Culkin, but the way it reinforces the anti-youth hysteria that was plaguing the United States in the 1990's. The scene where Henry Evans(Culkin) confides in his cousin Mark (Elijah Wood) that his youth and innocent demeanor makes it easy to do anything is just one example of this message. They think that just because kids get shorter jail sentences that they have an easier time there and have a better chance of being rehabilitated than adult criminals, so we have to be outrageously harder on them than adult criminals. They also think kids who have run-ins with the law are automatically guilty, and overlook issues like self-defense or the idea of kids being driven or forced into lives of crime, and even dismissing the idea of giving them a fair trial.This movie along with Wag the Dog(1997) a few years later, proves it's not kids who believe everything they see on television and in the movies, but us adults.

It wants to be 'The Bad Seed,' but it more resembles late-eighties/early-nineties thrillers like 'The Stepfather,' 'Sleeping With the Enemy' and 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.' And why shouldn't it? It was directed by the same guy who did the first two, and it really is the last gasp of that school of trouble-in-suburban-paradise Hollywood pictures. This one's not set in the suburbs, but rather on the rocky, windswept Maine coast; still, all the requisite elements are there--the BIG BEAUTIFUL EXPENSIVE HOUSE, the HAUNTING TRAGEDY FROM THE PAST, the ANGELIC NEW FRIEND/SURROGATE PARENT/LOVER/BABYSITTER appearing on the scene (with an ominous, overdone score tipping us off about his or her TRUE NATURE), the WELL-MEANING-BUT-DUMB-AS-STUMPS LOVED ONES who don't realize the truth until the NICK OF TIME, etc. The list goes on and on. This time it's little pop-eyed Elijah Wood who's the only sane person in the world, left with dull relatives after widowed dad David Morse (whose appearance amounts to little more than a cameo) high-tails it for Japan, and pop icon Macauley Culkin is the blandly blond cherub with Satan's heart. Culkin's actually not at all bad in this (even if his lipstick's a bit heavy), and we come away wishing that he had been able to overcome his 'Home Alone' association (and keep his sh*t together in his personal life) enough to still have a career. Wood, on the other hand, may have grown up to be a passable actor, but here he does little more than squeak his lines, usually with a look suggesting he's just taken it in the small of the back with a cow taser. Quinn Culkin has literally none of her brother's screen presence--in fact, I barely remember her speaking--but we do feel bad for her when the little rat pushes her onto the ice. From their acting, the actors playing the parents seem to think they're in an antihistamine commercial, or maybe one for Campbell's soup.I don't mean to suggest I went into this movie expecting it to be good, but the problem is it really isn't entertainingly bad either. And it refuses to commit, too. Don't get me wrong, it's plenty unpleasant (in the knee-jerk way these pictures always are), but it never takes its ugliness to the next level. It can't--it's too afraid of offending its lazy middlebrow audience.So we see little Macauley cause a ten-car pileup--but it's OK, nobody gets killed. So he pushes Sis into the frozen pond--no big deal, they pull her out just in time. So the parents think that ELIJAH is actually the dangerously disturbed one--it's okay, because all they do is send him to his room, basically. Then, after the hasty, melodramatic, and disturbingly hollow climax, we are treated to a delightful image of a little broken body down there on the rocks; as far as dead-child-movie-moments go, it ranks right up there with poor Piggy's demise in the 1990 remake of 'Lord of the Flies.' But it's really the only place where the filmmakers show any kind of guts whatsoever, and it comes far too late to turn 'The Good Son' into a truly scary (or, failing that, a hilariously tasteless) work. 3.5 out of 10.

Mark likes the time that he spends with his family because at first, they seem picture perfect, and that's what Mark wants at a time like that, a feeling of being part of a whole family again. But, Mark soon comes to realize that everything is not as picture perfect as it seemed when his strange cousin, Henry Evans (Culkin) starts to reveal his sociopathic nature. Of course, in a movie like this, no one believes Mark that little Henry could be a bad kid, so Mark takes it upon himself to protect Henry's unsuspecting family (and especially Henry's mother) from their twisted little boy when they would not do so for themselves. And Henry has a grand old time, trying to psyche Mark out with all the nasty things he hints that he may or may not do (or have already done).I saw this movie a lot when I was a kid because I was so in love with Elijah Wood at the time.

Could it be that his acting truly sucks and that it was about time he was paired with someone his age to proove it?  This is a good movie and well worth seeing.  However, I believe that this movie finally displayed to those too blind to see past Culkin's so called cute looks how much his acting abilities sucked! On the other hand, hats off to Elijah Wood (a truly talented child actor) for a job well done.  I'm sure that this was the film that set his career in motion.

And thus it begins.The story is a young boy (Elijah Wood) has just lost his mother to some sickness. His father (the incomparable David Morse, totally wasted by not being in more than the very beginning, maybe five minutes) drops him off at his brother's house, while he goes to make a business deal so the two can be financially satisfied and be together again. It starts off somewhat sentimentally, but with a kid with a face like Wood's it's kinda hard not to be. Oh yeah, his brother has a kid (Macaulay Culkin) who gives one of the 90's best performances as Satan himself. Well, he doesn't play Lucifer, but that's basically what he's asked to act like. And damned if the two boys aren't good (I love talking about child actors as if they're kids, even when, as is the case here, they're older than me). Too bad the movie isn't.(For example Mark says to his father that his mother will come back, maybe in another form. And whaddya know, about five minutes later his beautiful, kind aunt comes into the picture. As far as subtlety is concerned, this isn't exactly winning awards.)Culkin was a part of my childhood and the childhoods of most people my age. His Henry sounds intelligent beyond his age without sounding very phony. In place of phoniness comes a creepy smarminess. Henry's an evil little freak, a precocious young boy with a penchant for blackmail. And he plays the character with an impassivity that's equally annoying as it is frightening.Henry's playful with Mark. He helps him deal with the pain of his recently lost mother by doing rough, childlike things. They engage in typically destructive childhood activities like throwing rocks through the windows of old buildings and shooting bolts at animals. You know, the usual.Along with movies like The Land Before Time, The NeverEnding Story, The Secret of NIMH and Flight of the Navigator, (though I grew up in the early nineties, I guess my mom looked for the classics of that wonderful decade -- the 80s) this film is a part of my nostalgic childhood memory vault, so I was worried that it might be hard to be objective. Ha ha. I wanted to re-watch the film and be able to prove Roger Ebert wrong, who basically called the movie sick. I wish I could argue with him.The big contrast in the movie, of course, is between the good Mark and the evil Henry. For Christ's sake, there's even a discussion with a psychiatrist about what evil really is. Mark thinks his mother dying of a sickness was somehow his fault and is ready to take full responsibility for it, while Henry, that little devil, takes pleasure in causing death.The film episodically moves from bad act to worse act (that's act as in deed, but the film does get progressively worse, so the double meaning of screenplay act is strangely appropriate). By the end, it turns into an actioner complete with sounding horns and wild African drumming to make sure your heart is a-pumping.Early in the film, before it got ludicrous and asked her to completely debase her character, I thought the mother Susan (Wendy Crewson) was interesting. I checked her out on IMDb and while she hasn't been in anything really noteworthy (although playing the wife in Air Force One is probably why I recognized her), I found out that she's from my Canadian city and went to a school I know! (I do get joy from the little things.)After about forty-five minutes I really wanted David Morse to come back. After him, the most interesting and plausible character was, at least I thought, the psychiatrist, who's in the film for maybe five minutes.It's not just that the movie doesn't work, it's that it combines not working with that conspiratorial cliché of the good guy being framed by the evil guy and the good guy trying to prove that he's being framed by the evil guy and having no one believe him -- and topping it all off with a dose of immorality. (It doesn't help when we've got cheese ball lines like I guess I'll always wonder, but I know I'll never ask.) This stuff happens in life, but why make a movie about it for entertainment purposes? (Cause it sure as hell isn't art.)What's really upsetting is that when the credits roll, with the theme music that suggests the promise of the opening moments, we realize that had the director scrapped everything after the first five minutes with Morse and Wood this could have been one of those great little movies, in this case about a child grappling and coming to terms with the death of his mother. Something in the vein of What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Nobody's Fool or even that other one Wood was in, The Ice Storm.Instead we've got ten year-old Macaulay Culkin saying, Don't f--- with me.*1/2 "},{"Title":"Foolish, jaw-droppingly irresponsible variation on The Bad Seed","Date":"24 October 2005","Score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Slickly-made but overwrought, brainless thriller has young Elijah Wood mourning the death of his mother, going to stay with relatives and falling victim to cousin Macaulay Culkin's twisted pranks. After suffering first-hand through a (suspicious) death in the family, Culkin's parents don't even think twice about leaving the kids home alone, nor do they seem cognizant of their child's dark side (is he that good an actor?). Culkin does well with a showy role, although his version of evil is to talk slowly in a quiet monotone; Wood is dignified and pretty believable, which is really saying something for a movie as outlandish as this. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Should be retitled The Bad Mother","Date":"30 April 2002","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Really it should i mean what kind of mother lets two ten year old (???) boys that are under her care run off into the forest or wherever??!?!!?

Henry acts like a total spas, it's not even scary, just stupid, it doesn't even seem real being played by Mac. Henry tries to kill people. His hobbies seen include, killing dogs, and cats, causing car accidents (but no one died) trying to kill his sister on thin ice, and etc. Unlike Domestic Disturbance, or What Lies Beneath there lead no clues that are seekin by anyone but Mark.The end happens without much letup, and there's no time anyone, thinks, what's going on? and when it's too late, H-H-Henry's trying' to kill us' his innocent was a mask all along, were were complete jerks for not listening to you, and cussing and yelling when you tried to tell us about Henry, disappointingly, the only person other than Mark that we see find out is Susan (Wendy Crewson) Henry's mom. The movie is too depressing. The psychiatrist, despite not believing Mark, is the most understanding, loving person ever, who thinks there's a reason for everything. The movie is not hardly violent there's not much bad language, but there is an F-word, and 0 nudity, I don't see why it couldn't of been PG-13. I hate how there are no psychological issues, Psychos are always formed by, a traumatic childhood etc. and are discovered, but we never find out why henry is so evil.

What am I saying? it doesn't have any! I don't want to buy into whether it's Culkin's best, worst or whatever film ...it is easily his most unpleasant. As young Henry, Culkin runs the gamut of evil child in an outwardly nice little boy package. I can live with Jason, Freddy and Michael Myers slaughtering the cast - that's their thing - it SUITS them, but whip me and hang me out to bleed, I don't get off on watching little kids who having killed their infant brother, shoot dogs with nail guns, toss their sister through some thin ice then move up in class to try shoving their mother off a cliff. The conclusion when a mother is forced to drop ONE of her children to save the other, does not rate highly on my entertainment scale either.Ok...Elijah Wood handles himself well, Culkin is okayish in a total role reversal for him. Aside from that, the flick just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Has all the appeal of a documentary on 12 year old prostitutes!

Not only is it stupid, it's disturbing seeing filmmakers having an eleven-year-old kill people.The film starts out with Elijah Wood going to live with his Aunt and Uncle after his mother dies, because his father has a business deal in Japan (or something like that). Upon arrival at his relatives' home, he meets Macaulay Culkin, who makes a startling appearance in a mask.The boys become friends, but Wood starts to see things happening. Culkin kills a dog with a nail-gun he created. And then he tries to kill his sister (numerous times). And then we find out that years ago, Culkin's little brother drowned in the bathtub while Culkin was looking over him (we find out later he killed the boy because his brother got one of his toys--a rubber duck--and he wanted it back). So then Wood has to convince everyone that Culkin is a homicidal maniac with serious problems before the sister dies.I read a review of Roger Ebert's on this film, and it's exactly what stuck out at me when I originally watched the film What kind of filmmakers have a small child in a role where he is killing people? Especially when the film has with a kid killing off his family members. It's just wrong to do when children are at that young an age.And furthermore, why cast Culkin? Macaulay Culkin is one of the worst child actors I've seen in a long time, and luckily his reign has ended. Now we have Haley Joel Osment, who actually has gained the honor of being a good child actor. Let's contrast between the two, shall we? In The Sixth Sense, Osment delivers many speeches where he cries or acts frightened. In The Good Son, Culkin delivers a speech to Wood while they are standing at the refrigerator. He mumbles every badly-written line helplessly. He stares at Wood, motionless, without facial expressions. He looks like he's reading his lines off the top of Wood's forehead.Now, you could say his part calls for no emotions, but this kid ALWAYS has that look on his face in ALL his movies. I mean, other than his role in Uncle Buck, the kid just can't act. Home Alone was a good film...but not because of him. That was due to a great script and great supporting cast. And that's it. The Good Son is not only disturbing, but very mediocre in what it is. It's just like all those eighties so-called thrillers that came out that were no more than 90 minutes of basic chills. The script is awful.But one of the worst things about this film is the fact that it seems written for/by children...yet it is in no way suitable for children. At all. It's a sick, twisted film that tries to be both a thriller/chiller, and a kids' movie. It's neither.1/5 stars - "}]
