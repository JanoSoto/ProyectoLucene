Don't you people remember being kids? What would you do if you found out there were no parents anywhere around? Yep-the same thing they did, party until you're constipated.THEN wonder where your parents are. Kids like burp and fart jokes because they're kids. How many times can you recall in your childhood when a well-timed burp would disrupt a class for the remainder of the day? And just to add my son't two cents the part where Poultra is conked on the head by the getaway ship and is going to fall on the audience... my son finds nothing funnier than the thought of a chicken with butt cheeks. Why don't you people see the movie for the entertainment that it is and not pick it apart like some Oscar Nominations Panel?  I have two words for you people... UN PUCKER.

I laughed and thought it was great but when I played it for the second time, with a couple of little kids in the audience I was disappointed that most of the humor went over their heads. All of a sudden, the film wasn't as great as I had remembered (and told them it was). So.....what you think of this film, I guess might depend on your age, for one thing.There's a nice message here for the kids, though you can't do without your parents. Speaking of kids, the nerdy-looking fat kid obviously was the funniest in here. Everyone in the audience likes him.One bit of warning to the older folks keep the audio remote handy. This gets very loud in spots and needs to be turned down here and there.

The premise sounded way too kiddy and the fact that it was going to be a TV show made the whole thing scream, Marketing! Thankfully I just caught it on video and was wonderfully surprised. The animation is very good and nicely detailed, the humor is simple and G-rated for kids, which will please adults, and the story is fast-paced and creative. I liked all of the characters, from the whipped-cream hair sporting Jimmy to his nerdy friends and the evil booger aliens. There were some genuinely cool touches too, like the fight between a tiny teacher and the deadly apple worm or the detailed alien chicken. My only real complaint is the fact that the soundtrack is packed to the brim with dumb pop songs that pop up at the weirdest times and basically interrupt the flow of the whole movie. Also, any movie with Aaron Carter singing in it quickly gets a few points demoted from it.  You can stick around after the video's credits for some music videos, one with the C arter kid and another with some girls singing We're the Kids In America. They are not spectacular extras, which makes me yearn for a DVD player even more, now. All in all, though, Jimmy is a pleasant, short flick that won't keep adults in a coma and will definitely get the kids quiet for an hour. It may not be up there with the Pixar films or Shrek, but it is decent nonetheless. 3/4 stars.

A previous reviewer described it as something to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon and that sounds like an adequate description. There are a few reviews on this website of the film though which feel a bit harsh. Ultimately, theres no denying that Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is a kids film, that's what it was meant to be, that's what it is. That's not a bad thing though. Whilst it may not have the adult humour of other animations (mainly the greatest animation of them all, Shrek), it does still have the occasional funny joke that will make people of all ages laugh. Whilst the plot is a bit wafer thin and the animation a bit simplistic at times, I'd like to see most of the reviewers on this website try and do better. Ultimately, I can understand that to some people, this film may not be their cup of tea, and for a long time I avoided trying to watch it. Once you sit down and give it the time of day though, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Not the best animation of the last few years, but definately worth a viewing.

Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius was a surprise Best Animated Feature nominee in 2001 (the category's first year). It seemed to be the oddball production in a group which included Shrek and Monsters, Inc. (there were only three films nominated in that category that year). Overall though Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is on par with Shrek (one of the more over-rated films of the past few years) and stands tall with the superior Monsters, Inc.. Admittedly the movie is excellent for children, but only fair for hardened adults. It lacks the charm for wide audiences that most other animated features have these days. Still, Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius serves its purpose to the paramount and continues to be a money-maker for Nickelodeon (there is a regular series airing now on that network). First-rate animation (that has that striking aquarium-style appeal to it) and good voice characterizations (Martin Short and Patrick Stewart in particular as the comical aliens) make the movie one of the better films of 2001. 4 stars out of 5.

I was thirteen, too old and mature for kiddie pictures. I had seen what Nick had done with their movies in the past and couldn't believe some smart kid picture with the usual fare of gross jokes could be remotely entertaining. I also refused to watch the T.V. series. That it, until I caught an episode one afternoon and realized what an entertainment gem I was missing. The plot of JN is fairly simple- Jimmy is a ten year old genius who wants nothing more than to hang out with his friends and fix the wiring on his shrink ray. However, his inventions cause chaos and his parents want him around for a few more years-restricting him from going out late. Easy enough, but we learn that earlier Jimmy made alien contact, and now the aliens have abducted all of the Earth's parents. Sure, it's a party for a day or so, but soon its up to Jimmy, Carl, Cindy, Sheen, and Libby to save the day.To risk sounding like a clich√©d robot, the genius of the film is in the unique characters. Carl, Jimmy's best friend is a llama-loving dunce while Sheen is Ultra-Lord obsessed-an EXCELLENT parody on the fan boy generation. Of course, the best character interaction is between Jimmy and his nemesis Cindy-the second smartest kid in school. Cindy's a tough girl who's hard on him simply for being what he is-a geeky smart guy who's got a slight reputation for knowing it all. Yet, when Jimmy's self-esteem fails, he'll only believe Cindy to tell him what a great guy he really is.I'm sure you've noticed the recent trend in cartoons for adults over the years. Jimmy is no exception, tossing in the mandatory kiddie fare with some sharp references and unique character play. Movie fans may hold Shrek as their holy grail of animated comedy, but in my opinion, Jimmy Neutron can more than stand up to the jolly green giant. In conclusion, don't miss Jimmy Neutron simply because its a Nickelodeon kid's movie. This film is smart and funny with more than enough intelligence for everyone.

What stood out immediately was the animation, the coloring, the bold attention to detail, and the fact that none of it was lost on the DVD. Occasionally, you find yourself watching an animated film wondering how many drinks the animators may have had while attempting to create artwork, which suddenly becomes even more visible in the comfort of your own home. There has been, in my time reviewing these films, one film that has been animated flawlessly. That was The Incredibles, and while Neutron is not that film, the two do stand very well together. Aside from the standing ovation animation, the rest of the film is actual a fun watch. Going into this film with no knowledge of the character Jimmy Neutron or his history, I found myself eager to enjoy more of his adventures and further deeper into his world.One of the enjoyable elements of this film has to be the pacing. While some will argue that you cannot judge a film by the mere merit of time, for Jimmy Neutron you can. I didn't want to get bogged down, I didn't want to loose my attention span, and thankfully &#150; with the skilled penmanship of one Steve Oedekerk &#150; I learned to sit back and thoroughly enjoy what Jimmy had to offer. I wasn't distracted by small, insignificant plot alleys or forgettable characters; with Neutron what you see is what you get. For approximately 82 minutes we are packed with one exciting element after another without getting sidetracked. From the opening pull sequence to the center amusement park transformation, all the way to the final climactic scene which incorporated all the themes and elements from earlier in the film, Neutron honestly didn't let you down. The humor was crisp, the characters were actually enjoyable to watch, and unlike other films of this genre, you knew what was going to happen, but you weren't quite sure how. I think that is what kept my attention the longest, with the brain power of Neutron; I was never quite sure what he was going to combine next. The opportunities were endless, and I enjoyed seeing them unfold right before me. Laugh all you want, but Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius was an enjoyable experience.Why is it that women can do pre-pubescent boy voices better than anyone else? I loved the voices in this film mainly because it didn't focus on trying to give you the who is that voice quiz game, but rather employ unknowns and allow the film to do the talking. While I have to give the entire cast excellent marks on their work with this film, it was Patrick Stewart and (I can't believe I am saying this&#133;) Martin Short's comical combination that did it for me. They aren't big stars, so I didn't hear the voice and immediately see the actor, I saw the Martian counterparts that they were trying to portray! Coupled with the fact that they looked hysterical (humorous physical depictions of alien life), I found myself laughing at this pair more than I imagined. Stewart controlled his voice and delivered (with ease) some of the best one-liners of this film, while Short added the final punch needed to make the kiddies in the audience laugh. For me, the two worked brilliantly together and could honestly carry a show of their own together. Short wasn't over the top, and the two created a strong balance which coupled well with the seriousness of Neutron's quest.Alas, I cannot give it the full five stars, mainly because of an issue of redundancy. Perhaps that isn't the right word, but what I am trying to say is that this is a show that prides itself on the genius of the main character, Jimmy. What makes this show work is that he is by far the smartest child on the Earth, yet his parents keep him grounded (which creates likability for the viewers) by making him do chores, get in trouble, and create boundaries. Yet, for all the inventions that Jimmy creates, for all the tests that he passes in school, he seems to forget that there is no air in space and therefore the entire plausibility of all the children in his town flying to this obscure planet is debunked. I realize that this is a cartoon, a-hem, an animated feature and that I should just accept the fact that in this world there is air in space, but I couldn't buy it. Without the masks or helmets, I felt cheated and was pulled away from the truth, thus forcing me to realize I was watching a film. Make sense? I was deeply involved with this film until the kids rallied together and shot into space, because of the fake nature of it. I couldn't move past it, and was a discouraging element to the film.Overall, I would strongly suggest this film to families, and in fact, friends. I thought this was a very funny, very smart, and exceptionally well animated film, especially during the age of Pixar. The voices were perfect, the pacing (as mentioned before) was a slice of perfection, and the overall molding of this film was nearly flawless. Outside of the scientific elements that should have been caught (due to the intelligence of our main character), there were moments of pure Oedekerk that made me grin from ear to ear. I liked Jimmy Neutron, and while it may get me laughed at on the playground, I thought that for what it was worth, it gave a good 92% -- and that is still an A isn't it?

Not that &#145;Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius' has the wit, intelligence and dark edge of a Calvin and Hobbes comic, but it is blistering with a loony imagination and is much smarter and more genuine than anything else found on the network on in it's parent movies to date. JN feels like it was made independent of any meddling from the suits at Nickelodeon and - all except a disappointing final scene that pushes scatological humor into lame &#145;Shrek' territory - is surprisingly free of the general stupidity these movies (and shows) are known for.This movie effectively introduces us to Neutron, and his friends Carl and Sean (whose nasally voice by Jeffrey Garcia I found just intrinsically funny) and gives them an epic cinematic adventure to deal with.  When Jimmy launches a toaster-satellite into orbit he attracts a race of gooey aliens in flying half-glass eggshells (a sight) who abduct the town's parents.  Predictably the kids go nuts without supervision, and predictably they miss their parents and travel the stars to retrieve them in the process learning about family and authority.  However, under the direction of John A. Davis and the pen of Davis and collaborator Steve Oedekirk &#145;Jimmy Neutron' approaches it's material with a respect for the characters and their audience and in a few patches &#150; as in when Neutron explains, in not so many words, why he dreads puberty &#150; is smarter than it's target audience will probably credit it. The animation is an eye-poppingly in it's simply designed beauty. In many ways I prefer this surreal, purely cartoony style to the painstaking attention to detail of the Pixar movies.  It just goes to show the difference in styles in animation between animated films and movies that are still unabashedly cartoons and 'Neutron' proudly resides. The score jumps with a pop soundtrack as vibrant as the visuals - featuring the Go-Go's, Jimmy's own theme and Lil' Romeo redoing Will Smith's Parent's Just Don't Understand all of which sounds amazingly lame on paper but comes off quite good. Davis is able to maintain it's ridiculous fun and creativity throughout. Davis and Oedekirk ('Neutron' is by far this guy's best movie) have made one of those few distinctly children's movies that adults can be proud of too. A strong, worthwhile entry in the small arena of great non-Disney animated movies...and no, that doesn't include &#145;Shrek'.

Our Hero Jimmy starts and ends the film being a self-confident brat. His personal battle with his own height is trite because of this, he should have started the film with more self-doubt.Also, there is no kid/adult device to endear us to him. Most family movies play on a theme of `good heart wrongly accused' or similar such romantic notion. No such convolution here, our hero Jimmy learns `not to talk to strangers' for a very simple morale.HOWEVERIt is obvious the creators did not bother being the `cutting edge' of CG. This is a good thing because instead of boring studies into the treatment of hair and fabric they concentrated on getting a rich image. The bold use of colour, texture and lighting affects comes together in a very appealing visual style.Also, I personally found the musical sequences to be a lot more fun than the generally adult centric Toy Story and Shrek sequences (O.K `Jessie's Story' from TS2 still wins).The ultimate compliment for this film is that my children (5 and 7) thoroughly enjoyed its fast pace and cartoon style.

Before I saw it, I was surprised that it was nominated for Best Animated Feature...now I think it's as good if not better than Shrek.

I haven't been a child in a long time but think any kid who's ever felt like he or she didn't fit in cause they were different or smarter will more than understand this movie.  If if they are now adults.  I loved all of the sly references and send ups of the sci fi or anime type conventions and genres.  The effects were great the animation seamless and it didn't depend soley on them either. The kids were natural and well filled out as believable characters with understandable motivations.  And let's face it, Jimmy's robot dog, Goddard practically stole the entire movie. First class voice talent, as well as a good story and believable characters made for a movie that gets better with each viewing.  I would love to see more of them made.

A garbled signal from space sees him trying to locate the source by heading out of Earth's atmosphere but without any success. Jimmy's parents try to encourage his genius but a boy needs rules and they still have to be a bit strict with him. Naturally this doesn't stop Jimmy and sneaking out to the Future Fair is only one of the ways he shows his independence. However when an alien fleet kidnaps all the adults from earth, Jimmy and his friends have little time to rescue them (after initially enjoying a bit of freedom of course).With a cool, if overly computerised look and feel to it I thought I'd give this film a go while a little bored over the Christmas period and, although not anything that great, I must admit that I quite enjoyed it. The computer animation is technically impressive but some other viewers might struggle with how very polished and computerised it all looks &#150; I wasn't looking for realism but I had hoped for a little bit of warmth or a human touch wouldn't have gone amiss. The plot is simple but quite enjoyable &#150; obviously you have to buy into it to go along with it but it will certainly engage children easily enough. The jokes match the animation in that they are mainly childish, colourful and harmless, however they are still easily enjoyed by adults as well as having basic stuff for children. There are some nice touches aimed at adults but if you're expecting the wit or intelligence of Toy Story in either the humour or the narrative then you'll probably be disappointed.The voice cast mainly match the harmless tone and nobody really does badly but nobody is able to make much of their characters via their performances. Derryberry is OK as Jimmy while all his friends' roles are well enough done by people like Garcia, Lawrence and Milo. DeCarlo is amusing as Jimmy's dad but the star guests are not quite as good as I would have liked. Stewart and Short both benefit from amusing alien characters but I thought that more could have been made of the semi-amusing Star Trek gags involving Stewart.Overall this is a colourful and entertaining film that will amuse children and at least be viewed by adults with some air of interest. Just don't expect anything approaching the quality of things like Toy Story etc and you should be OK with this.

"},{"Title":"Exercise your right to dream","Date":"1 January 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure","Review":" Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius was one of the biggest gambles Nickelodeon ever took and it paid off immensely. Making a film entirely off of the quick-witted shorts that the network aired in between programs frequently and off of one brief TV pilot isn't something every company jumps at the opportunity to do, but Nickelodeon bravely took a risk and it paid off by launching one of the network's most beloved cartoons.Personally, I was never a big fan of The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, which ran on Nickelodeon from 2002 to 2006 and spawned a spin-off in 2010 based on one of its side characters. I was big (and still am) on programs and movies that had relatable characters, and I couldn't much relate to an unsung genius who concocted little mechanical machines in his bedroom to use to benefit every day life. The show's main theme was the theme of being under-appreciated for a talent one boldly possesses and how one can go under the radar when they're potentially making a big difference.Yet at seventy-seven minutes, the official introduction we get of Jimmy Neutron, an incredibly advanced ten year old kid who has a knack for inventions, a super-powered mind, and a mechanical canine, isn't half bad and zips along with its free-spirited, relatively easy-on-the-eyes animation and cute, charming little premises that teaches the youth of today the importance of parental influence and societal order. Just don't tell your kids that going into it. Jimmy Neutron (voiced by Debi Derryberry) has been trying to make contact with alien lifeforms for weeks now, yet to no avail. He winds up sending them something of a care package with a video showing his parents, himself, his dog, and his life on earth.There is a new theme park opening in town and Jimmy and his friends Carl Wheezer (Rob Paulsen), a chubby asthmatic and Sheen (Jeffrey Garcia) are denied permission to attend the grand opening because of it being on a school night. They decide to rebel against parental authority and sneak out anyway, returning just in time before being caught by their parents. They wake up the next day to find all the adults removed from planet earth, leaving nothing but a generic note saying that they have gone to Florida. The kids are initially thrilled, free of the shackles of discipline, and commit acts they assume to be inconsequential such as having a contest to see who can eat the most cotton candy and who can wreak as much havoc.It soon backfires, with an influx of owies, boo-boos, tummy aches, and constipation (another reason I was off-put by this film when I was young was the thought of losing my mom and dad, who I preciously clung to like a magnet on a refrigerator; the scenes of the kids hurt in some way, crying for their parents deeply upset my wimp-self). Jimmy investigates and learn that giant, spherical aliens housing mysterious green liquids have kidnapped their parents and plan to make a surprise launch to space, using amusement park equipment as their rocketry.This is silly, innocuous fare that isn't as substantial as a Pixar endeavor, but light-years more effective in terms of escapism and imagination than anything currently on the primetime Nickelodeon lineup. The animation here replicates a more unpolished feel that improved on the typical hand-drawn animation pioneered by The Walt Disney Company, yet not refurbished to look like something along the lines of Monster's Inc. or Shrek (the animated competition during the original release of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius). The story depth is slim and slender too, which will definitely not be a burden to kids or adults, who should take time to appreciate and recognize the highly imaginative material at hand here. Reiterating that my liking for the show, even growing up, was small and concise, and my memory of the film's plot sour and not wholly positive, this was a pleasing and successful romp, emphasizing on what kid's need to do more of; dream.Voiced by Debi Derryberry, Rob Paulsen, Jeffrey Garcia, Patrick Stewart, and Martin Short.

However, the plot seems to lack continuity and there is a bit of this is a story for kids theme, that the best movies in the genre don't have. I've always secretly thought that this is for kids is code words for its not good enough for adults but we've got to sell it.Regarding the computer graphics (I've done a bit of computing myself), its O.K. (not quite Pixar level, but not bad).  The songs in the sound track aren't too bad (although a lot of stuff is recent remakes, with the newer recording artists than people my age are likely to listen to).So, its not a bad effort, but rather than ducking some hard issues and putting in some pandering stuff to try to appease the kids, it is better to let the kids deal with some hard issues.  If you want character development, more interesting story line, then Shrek, Babe, and Toy Story are far better movies (these are classics).

The little kids would just laugh at the corny jokes. Overall, the special effects (computer animation atleast) were fairly ok.

The movie opens with Jimmy Neutron and his buddy Carl flying a homemade rocket to the upper atmosphere to place a communications satellite, made from a toaster and a spatula, into orbit.Got it?  Good.Now the great thing with opening the movie this way is that from the very start, all bets are off.  This is obviously going to be a little kid's dream.  If you can't handle that, then get up right then because it only goes much further from there.  For me, the opening scene clicked me into the right frame of mind (of suspension of disbelief) and never jarred me out of it.Listen to any sentence that starts with Wouldn't it be cool if we had a... from the mouth of an 8-10 year old boy, and you would get the description of things that Jimmy Neutron makes  homemade rocketships, plants that eat girls, Burping Cola (a burp with every sip), or a robot dog. Much of the screen time is taken with Jimmy and pals playing with these, and other, things.The plot is simple, aliens take all the parents and Jimmy Neutron and the other kids go get them back.  But again, the thinking of an 8-10 year old boy is perfectly presented again.  Jimmy Neutron doesn't just make any old spaceship, he turns rides from an amusement park into interstellar ships to fly off to save the parents.This is a fun movie and just short enough to keep from getting to be stretched thin.  It is not as technically beautiful as the contemporary Monsters, Inc., but, unlike that souless movie, it much more fun.

Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is about, umm, a boy, named Jimmy Neutron who, in a surprising twist, is a genius. Jimmy Neutron (James Isaac Neutron to his mother) is an inventor, of course, and we are treated to dozens of his crazy inventions throughout the movie -- stuff that only a kid could possibly come up with! After trying to make contact with an alien civilization, all the adults in the neighbourhood are kidnapped, and Jimmy and his friends have to use his inventions to go get their parents back. Definitely a kid-friendly (ie. simple) plot, with plenty of eye-candy and bright colours for the little ones, but never gets 'dumb' either. There are plenty of in-jokes for the adults, and heck, even a few for us science geeks. So get out there, borrow a kid for an afternoon and check out Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius.

Davis et al.'s JIMMY NEUTRON BOY GENIUS is a well-done film that older viewers may find funnier than kids do There  are a number of nice little sight gags the kids will miss.   What bothers me is that kids will see the film on their own and not discuss it with elders, for the film has a strong MORAL (like the moral of a fable), a debatable one that they should start debating.   	The film teaches children that, with cops the only exception, strangers are not to be talked to-not even intergalactic strangers trying to make First Contact.  Or, especially not strangers who are truly alien, since aliens will kidnap your parents, possess them, and try to eat them.   Such a message may make some kids safer, but it's dangerous for community community is based on trust, and for any community beyond a very small village, that means trusting strangers.  	Older kids might follow JIMMY NEUTRON with renting TERMINATOR II, for the suggestion that even cops can be a threat-and older kids and younger should be talked with about the necessity for both caution and trust, in dealing with cops and other strangers.   Younger children should watch  E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL.    	There is an SF tradition, most famously shown in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951), that if aliens did arrive from space, some American would try to shoot them.   Americans aren't more xenophobic than most people, just better armed than most people.  Don't talk to strangers is one lesson kids must learn.  But the Jewish morning prayers rank Welcome the stranger as an obligation right up there with Honor father and mother, and there's a whole lot to be said for welcoming strangers, too.   JIMMY NEUTRON is a good place to start discussing with kids such conflicts.

And when I came out of the theaters, I wasn't at all near disappointed.

Carolyn Lawrence gives Cindy the perfect girly additude voice that can change from know-it-all to serious to caring to in love. Jeffrey Garcia gives Sheen that perfect voice that tells us when he's afraid or when he's brave or thinking of Ultra Lord. Crystal Scales gives Libby a smarty voice like she is, Andrea Martain gives teacher Ms. Fowl the perfect nonosense teacher voice as well as living to the name Fowl as she gives a great chicken voice. Megan Cavanagh gives Jimmy's mom that great motherly voice that goes from caring to you know better than that, Mark DeCarlo gives Jimmy's dad that famous not quite smart dad voice. To make a long story short, the people who did the voices did an awesome job.The Animation Ok, this is why I think the animation is so great,it isn't overwhelming, it's colorful and bright, it doesn't distract you from the story, and the way the characters are designed isn't realistic, no one can have Jimmy's head or hair like his! What really struck me as awesome was that the people who made this used what is called Off the shelf animation in other words, you can buy the stuff they use to make the movie from Best Buy.To make this long story short, this is one of the best animated movies of all time!

They go to the opening of the Ultra-Lord Theme Park, where they ride rides, get sick, and touch llamas. When they are walking home, they see a shooting star and Jimmy makes the wish that parents would just go away. They all go home and when they wake up in the morning no parents! At first they think this is great, running around doing anything they want (this makes for a great sequence where they all run around to the tune of the Ramones' Blitzkreig Bop.)But, after one day, they realize that they want there parents back. Meanwhile, Jimmy is tracking his toaster satellite that he sent out to space. He picks up a signal from a slimy green egg type of alien. He finally realizes what happened to his parents. Aliens have kidnapped them! Jimmy and the rest of the neighborhood embark on a journey across the galaxy to get their parents back. The leader of these aliens is King Goobot (Patrick Stewart) who is accompanied by his bumbling servant Ooblar (Martin Short). Their plan is to sacrifice the parents to their god, a giant chicken. Can Jimmy and his friends stop these evil aliens in time?The thing I loved about this movie is it plays like a cheesy space opera. Jimmy Neutron is a lovable character with his Ace Ventura haircut.

CauleyJimmy Neutron is a boy genius whose adventures are lackluster to say the least.  This is a cutsie computer generated film that seems more cartoonish than anything.  This is no Shrek, it's not even a Monsters Inc.  The tots may enjoy themselves but parents will find themselves more entertained by their watches ticking away than Jimmy and his little friends.The plot is simple enough  all the parents are abducted by aliens and boy genius, Jimmy Neutron, is the only one with the brain power to get them back.  Maybe it was too simple.  The entire story was unimaginative and quite frankly, boring.  The key to a successful animated film is keeping the adults entertained as well as the children it's designed for.  In this, Jimmy Neutron  Boy Genius fails miserably.We're lead through a typical day in the life of Mr. Boy Wonder.  Being the shortest boy in his class, Jimmy takes a lot of ribbing from classmates. He gets a little too much grief from one girl in particular, Cindy Vortex. Jimmy is surrounded by his two best friends, Carl and Shane and his faithful mechanical dog, Goddard.  Carl is an overweight asthmatic and Shane is a little too obsessed with his favorite action figure, Ultra Lord.  Together with their classmates, they set out to take their parents back from the evil King Goobot and his idiot sidekick, Ooblar.This film couldn't even be saved by veteran actors, Patrick Stewart and Martin Short who voice King Goobot and Ooblar respectively.  Both were gobs of green goo with eyes, who traveled in hover vehicles.  Even the evil doers were unimaginative oafs.  The only thing I found remotely entertaining about Jimmy Neutron  Boy Genius was the soundtrack which included several '80s songs like She Blinded me with Science, We Got the Beat, and Kids in America.  Why?  I don't know.  But since there was nothing else to be entertained by, I didn't knock it.Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius lacks a lot of things.  Bite for one.  Walt Disney always knew that even children have to hate the bad guys.  He also knew how to create a plucky hero.  Jimmy just doesn't cut the mustard. Humor is another ingredient Jimmy Neutron is lacking.  One of the things that makes Disney movies so entertaining are the clever in-jokes for adults as well as the kiddie jokes that make the tots laugh out loud.  Jimmy Neutron was lacking both.  While your kids may get a few mild kicks out of it, you can only hoped to be kicked out of it.

Firstly it is beautifully animated, the backgrounds are audacious, the colours are lush and the character act and move convincingly. Secondly, the score is great, I love a good score in films and this succeeded in that department. Thirdly, while the plot is a little unoriginal and corny, I loved how fast it moved and how it drew me in.

First, the characters seemed to have a little more depth than they do on the show. Hugh is funnier and more interesting and even Sheen isn't quite the dolt he is on TV. Carl is still Carl. I found Ms. Fowl to be extra annoying. Still, it's more kiddie fare than it is family. There's less for adults to relate to than say, The Incredibles. While adults are important to the story, they aren't seen often. Jimmy's parents are more human and like real parents, though. As far as animation goes, it's a little too CGI, more like GameCube graphics. You can see how it improved over the years on TV. Overall, it's a pretty good movie. Another posting refers to it as a rainy day film, that's about right.

This certainly helps explain why it fits so perfectly on the small screen, not least due to it playing like a cross between Dexter's Laboratory and Cubix.Dexter - er, James Isaac Neutron - is a little boy with a huge brain in the town of Retroville (a town so retro that the soundtrack includes versions of We Got The Beat and Kids in America) whose toaster satellite, launched to make contact with aliens, is more successful than he planned and brings an entire race of unfriendly aliens to Earth. And only one person can save us... step forward Jimmy Neutron.The movie's more concerned with entertaining children than catering to knowing adults, which is no bad thing; it's just not very exciting without any real attempts to be out of the ordinary in its plotting, characterisation or even in John Debney's Elfman-meets-David Newman score. BUT the movie gets better as it goes along, it's colourful, amusing and pacy, and Patrick Stewart's vocalisation of the king of the aliens is a campy treat; there are also some genuinely effective moments in the eighty or so minutes.In the end it's by no means a bad movie, but Nickelodeon can and has done better.

The whole appeal of this kind of childish humour is that it's forbidden fruit.  If it's NOT forbidden fruit - if it's sanctioned - then it's simply boring, and (in the context of this kind of fantasy) it kills the mood.  At least, that's the kind of effect I suspect it would have had on me as a child.  It certainly has that effect on me as an adult.The animation is not simple or even (by, say, Pixar standards) particularly stylised.  It's just bad.  There's nothing clever or expressive or anything much about the way these overly-caricatured oblongs and ovals MOVE.  The title character is hard to take and neither he nor anyone else is real enough the adults are cardboard figures built to be contemplated by children, but the children are cardboard figures built to be contemplated by adults; as a result, we're constantly watching two sets of cardboard figures set at right angles to one another.

I guess I might as well let it be known that I don't like Nicktoons. Nickelodeon used to have good stuff, but I've long since lost all respect for them. Jimmy Neutron is more of the same Nicktoon pandering garbage. Jimmy is whiny and unconvincing, and the only reason for any attachment with the audience is the fact that he's a geeky outcast that nobody loves. This makes him seem fake, like he's less of a character and more a bunch of stereotypes. The other characters are flat, two dimensional, stereotypical jokes. None of this would be too bad if the characters were bouncy and interesting. Unfortunately, they're not even half alive. Many of the characters are rude and unappealing. The villains, if you can call them that, are especially stupid. The humor is occasionally inventive, but many times it's boring, childish, and too straightforward. The message about the importance of your parents is simplistic, pandering, and crammed down your throat, rather than being worked into the movie cleverly. Even then, it's nearly drowned out by the segment that seemingly condones bad behavior. Late in the running, the movie tries to go for heart, but it feels forced and simplistic, sticks out like a sore thumb, and comes much too little too late. Finally, the animation, especially the background, has no sense of art or fun. Quite frankly, it's unimpressive. While one notch above the pathetically lousy Osmosis Jones and several notches above such fare as the Pokemon movies and the Rugrats movies, Jimmy Neutron is just one boring, sugary, pandering been there, done that fare. Even though the dvd is out, skip this dog of a movie and just go check out The Powerpuff Girls, which this movie is vastly inferior to.

He has a robotic dog named Goddard and brings a shrink ray to school for show and tell. And part way through the film all of the parents are abducted by aliens.The preview looked entertaining, but the worry was that the rest of the film wouldn't hold up or the whole premise would get old.

(Not having to chose at all would be the ideal option, but this isn't an ideal world.)  Since I'm an animation buff, I already had the Jimmy Neutron movie on my must-see list, and this week seemed like a good time to see it.  Yeah, it was fun.  The question is, was it ENOUGH fun?As befits a movie about a boy genius, JNBG shows off a lot of intelligence. There's a lot of wit, both visual (most of Jimmy's homemade gadgetry) and verbal (well, I liked the Blair Witch reference, anyway).  The characters and objects are animated like puppets, but it's senseless to complain about it since this was so obviously an artistic choice.  On the other hand, the outer-space sequences were genuinely wondrous.  (More about this later.)As for the characters and the plot, that's where things get sticky.  The story idea (aliens kidnap all the adults in Retroville, and while the kids have fun for a while they realize it's up to them to rescue their parents) is intriguing, but its execution feels like a genre exercise, giving the characters plot coupons rather than choices.  The characters themselves come off as either comic relief (Jimmy's friends Carl and Sheen) or plot functionaries (the villains, Jimmy's parents, and his nemesis-turned-ally Cindy Vortex), with only Jimmy himself showing much individuality.  (This is not intended as a criticism of the voice cast, by the way; everyone from Debi Derryberry on down does a fine job.)  Most of the character detailing occurs early on (Jimmy's preparations for school, Cindy's tai-chi-and-soda-pop exercises), but there's not enough of it.About those space visuals I noticed that two Hugo-winning artists, Bob Eggleton and Don Maitz, were credited as conceptual designers.  This indicates to me that more thought went into JNBG's visuals than its plot. (By the way, I don't mean to slight the other artists who worked on JNBG by singling out the two Hugo-winners, these are just names I know and I'm familiar with their work.  I suppose it's too late to hope for an Art of JNBG book by now, alas.)  The writers-director John A. Davis, plus Steve Oedekerk, David N. Weiss, and J. David Stern-have a substantial list of credits between them, but none of them appear to have much experience with either space movies or adventure movies.  Not that their conception of the movie was bad, but they let the plot swallow up the characters without giving much back in return.Still, even if JNBG is no Monsters Inc. or Shrek, it does compare favorably to Osmosis Jones and Atlantis.  However, if I haven't scared you off and you still want to see it, you might wait for its run in your local dollar theater.

It's like drinking a pot of coffee or consuming sugary products-you get the instant buzz, but it wears off fast and the long term results are minimal. Instead, why not consume fruits and juices, which will give you sustained energy and healthy nutrients. Or, in this case, watch a movie that will entertain beyond the external exuberance.Jimmy Neutron is the sugary junk all kids love. With colorful images and high-spirited enthusiasm, what youngster would not like it? They will get a 82 minute thrill, but when the ending credits appear they will probably never think about the film again.The film does identify with kids well. We meet a boy genius, Jimmy Neutron, who has moronic parents and lots of homemade gadgets and gizmos. He is not the coolest kid on the block, but he is really smart and is kept company by a chubby friend and a mechanical dog.One day aliens abduct all the neighborhood parents. The kids jump for joy. Who needs those annoying, restrictive, old fogies who won't even let them go to concerts on school nights? But soon enough, Jimmy and the rest of the kids realize they need their parents, and it's up to Jimmy to lead the army of children to save their folks.Jimmy Neutron was first introduced in a 1995 animated short as Johnny Quasar. He's everything every kid wants to be creative, resourceful, genuine, and energetic. I might have enjoyed this character as a kid. But then again, I might have enjoyed this entire movie if I was10 years old. But I'm not. And I didn't.The movie is heavy on enthusiasm, color, spirit, imagination, and action, but it never puts those variables to use. It attempts to unitize its strengths on a comic level, but it lacks a punch line. Although there is plenty of silly material here-parents do the chicken dance, alien creatures do strange things, a massive chicken attacks the kids-but none of these things evoke laughs. The material is prime for comedy, but the movie never tells the joke.For instance, the kid's have an old granny, teacher with a very strange voice. At one point, this woman shrinks and becomes the target of a worm. This situation could be funny, but the ideas themselves are not. It's not enough to have a teacher with a strange voice-the movie needs to tell a joke about her strange voice. Laughs need perfect timing, and this movie's watch is off.And we don't really care about anything that happens in the film. Although, on an external level, the film will entertain younger viewers. This is the kind of movie that kids could watch once a week. Well, I guess that's one use for this movie. Parents, here's the thing you've been looking for to keep your kids occupied.
