[{"Title":"As far as King adaptations go, this one is ace","Date":"11 March 2005","Score":"56 out of 63 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" The Dead Zone is one of the few King novels turned into really good movies. It is very true to the book in its first two thirds and integrates some nice new elements in the last. Making Sarah a supporter of Greg Stillson was a brilliant idea that adds a bit more intensity to the finale. Some details of the novel are only hinted at or cut out entirely (Johnny's mother's religious delusion, his first accident on the ice, the Wheel Of Fortune, etc), but compromises have to be made when turning a book with 500 pages into a feature length movie and I think the right editing choices have been made.The Dead Zone is not only an overlooked gem when it comes to Stephen King adaptations, it's also one of Cronenberg's best directing jobs, not very typical of his work, but pretty timeless. Sure, nowadays the accident at the beginning, Johnny's visions and the shootout at the end would be made more gripping and spectacular, but those minor flaws don't really make the movie seem all that dated.Of course, having read the book I enjoyed the movie as a portrayal of events I had pictured in my mind before. I don't know, if The Dead Zone is thrilling to first time viewers, too, since the plot leaps a little, being a series of episodes rather than one continuous story. After all, I believe that Christopher Walken's performance is strong enough to carry most of the story and make you care about this character and his fate. In fact, all the roles have been cast pretty accurately to my personal imagination.This movie is an artifact of the times when Hollywood's most important directors would fight for the opportunity to adapt one of Stephen King's novels. It's every bit as enjoyable as The Shining as a movie, it's just based on an inferior model. Still, The Dead Zone can be recommended to King fans as well as those who are indifferent to his work.

One of the very best Steven King adaptations.","Date":"22 May 2003","Score":"51 out of 59 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  I'm a great admirer of David Cronenberg, and The Dead Zone' could well be his most underrated movie. The problem is that it's just not very Cronenbergesque, and being Deprave Cronenberg's first mainstream Hollywood movie, and coming hot off his provocative and mind blowing 'Videodrome', many people regard it as some kind of sell out. I really cannot agree. If you forget your preconceived idea of what Cronenberg movies SHOULD be (and let's not forget his other career oddities 'Fast Company' or 'M. Butterfly'), and just accept it for what it is, you'll see that it is a very well made and well acted thriller, and is almost impossible to fault. In my opinion it joins Kubrick's 'The Shining' and De Palma's 'Carrie' as the most effective Steven King adaptations to date. Christopher Walken is on top form here, and I think gives one of his very best performances. The supporting cast are also excellent, the lovely Brooke Adams ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers'), horror veteran Herbert Lom ('Mark Of The Devil'), Martin Sheen ('Badlands'), Tom Skerritt ('Alien'), Anthony Zerbe ('The Omega Man'), and Cronenberg regular Nicholas Campbell, who is involved in the movies most unforgettable sequence. I've lost track of how many times I've watched 'The Dead Zone' over the years, but it never fails to hook me in, and I always get something more out of Walken's performance every time I view it. This movie may not be typical fare from David Cronenberg, but it is one of his most straightforward and entertaining films. Highly recommended.

The Dead Zone centers around young schoolteacher John Smith (the awesome Christopher Walken) who leads a pretty normal life in a small town in Maine. John is a nice young man with a classroom full of students who like him, a pretty girlfriend he wants to marry and a good relationship with his mom and dad. But late one night, a horrific car accident takes all of that away from him...and replaces it with the gift - or is it the curse? - of precognition. John awakens from a five year coma to find his girlfriend married to another man, his job long gone and his parents much more feeble and shaken. But the one thing he does have - and isn't sure he wants - is a powerful ability to see both into the past and the future. Everyone he touches is an open book - the nurse whose house is burning down, the doctor whose mother escaped Nazi occupied Poland, the reporter whose sister killed herself...and a brutal serial killer who is raping and strangling young women. But the worst is yet to come. John meets an eager and ruthless politician (Martin Sheen) who is determined to get into the White House and declare nuclear war in the name of God. John finally decides to make use of his harrowing visions and sets out to change the future, even if it means he will not live to see it for himself.This is an emotional, sorrowful tale of loss, grief and sacrifice. John is no superhero, no butt-kicking killing machine out to stomp the bad guys. He's a sad, lonely man with a limp and a terrible case of bad luck. The pain of John Smith haunts the expressive face of Christopher Walken throughout the entire film, and the rage he feels at the rotten hand that life has dealt him is understandable, believable and shattering. This is a man who has suffered every pain and loss that a man can suffer, yet is still determined to make the world a safe place for those he loves, even if it means losing them forever.John is indeed one of screendom's saddest heroes - accessible, believable and heartbreaking. Christopher Walken is thoroughly convincing in his performance here very likable and, at the same time, frighteningly intense. The cold, eternal winter in which the film takes place just reinforces the sense of loneliness and alienation. The violence is brief, but shocking, and the images are so powerful that they remain with you long after the film ends. Martin Sheen is also incredibly good as the dangerously psycho politician, and Brooke Adams is the dark ghost of regret as John's true love, Sarah. This is a powerful, unforgettable film, whether you consider it a mystery, a horror-thriller or a tragic love story. Don't miss it, if you can help it. 10 huge stars!

And how he does it, is through the use of touch. But life has changed within that time with his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) being married; he's basically crippled and no longer having a job. So now he uses his abilities to help a sheriff (Tom Skerritt) solve a murder case, to save a child's life and predicting world's fate from an evilly corrupt politician (Martin Sheen) who plans to be president.It's definitely one of my favourite King adaptations and you could say Cronenberg at his best. This time around Cronenberg has taken a more mainstream (even though depressing) approach with none of his grotesque and disturbing visuals evident, but that doesn't take away from the experience - as on show is good story telling, performances and film-making. Visually the film does hold strong imagery (especially the vision scenes) and also the picture truly captures the unsaturated colours of the wintry backdrop, which makes the bleak atmosphere such a dour affair. Though the sharp stabbing sounds when Johnny gets a vision truly knocks you, but it's the stinging outcome that made the film for me. Distinctive photography by Mark Irwin was beautifully constructed and pretty smooth in the detail of the settings. While, the driving score stood out and was particularly on the spot with capturing the right mood. Sound performances are given by the likes of the sympathetic Christopher Walken and the innocent Brooke Adams. Martian Sheen delivers a rather hammy performance and Tom Skerritt's performance is the total opposite, being rather toned down. Cronenberg's solid direction paces the film swiftly and also creates some well-staged sequences of tension that stick in your head. In all you can always expect dashing film-making by Cronenberg and that's what you get in this picture.The story is what I had some gripes with. At times it felt like writer Jeffrey Boam was trying to squeeze too much into the story. Some interesting and intelligent sub-plots (murder investigation) felt hurried and rather contrived - it was like it was concentrating and building more towards the final act instead. But then again time is money and it didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of this film. The plot is basically a portrait of a man coming to grips with his pain and accepting the fate his been chosen and also throw in some social commentary into the mix. Also added is the occasional dabbing of dry/witty remarks, but for me it was uncomfortable humour. That being pretty much the state of the film. One thing I noticed, but don't know if this symbolism was intended but the way Johnny is always wearing the black coat reminded me of death (fate). Especially with touch his can see into the future and actually alter what can happen (say death). Maybe it was just I? It isn't gut wrenching stuff (visually speaking) we've come to expect by Cronenberg, but still he nails down a well drawn up and gripping drama/thriller.

It holds up as well now as it did on its premiere over twenty years ago. Among its strengths are Jeffrey Boam's screenplay -- this adaptation catches all the essentials of King's story (losing only some of the mood-setting backstories), cuts some of the novel's dross, and adds a few spot-on creative tweaks of its own (e.g. the references to Poe and Irving, quite appropriate given hero Johnny Smith's profession).The acting is excellent throughout, from the starring roles down through smaller parts such as the hero's parents. I also love the moody, haunting score by Michael Kamen, which is a masterly adaptation of, and variation on, a theme from the second symphony of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.Be forewarned, however, that The Dead Zone is no horror movie in the sense of featuring vampires, ghosties, werewolves, or zombies. It might be called a thriller or even, loosely, science fiction, in the sense that it operates from the hypothetical what-if? premise of precognition, or seeing into the future. It could even be called a tragedy. There is certainly a terrible sense of loss over the star-crossed love of Johnny and Sarah at the end of this doom-laden story.

Dead Zone is such a masterpiece.Owing in no small part to the subtle yet compelling performance of Christopher Walken, who in the same year would star in one of my most beloved films of the genre, Brainstorm, Dead Zone may well be one of King's best. Almost certainly based to some extent on real-life psychic Peter Hurkos, Dead Zone shows the master, King, taking an already well known premise to a new and thrilling conclusion.The theme developed here is a common one for King. An innocent victim, through no fault of his own, is thrown into a paranormal world that will lead to an ultimate test. The idea is classic literary tragedy at its best, and is represented with equal aplomb in King's contemporaneous work such as Firestarter and Christine.Director David Cronenberg, smoking hot at the time with masterpieces of his own &#x96; Scanners and Videodrome, delivers a film that resonates perfectly with King's book, with pacing and tone that capture what was best about King in this period. King himself was experiencing his golden age, with Cujo, Firestarter, Carrie and The Shining rounding out his catalog within a few years. In other words, this is the best of the best for some people who gave us some pretty good stuff.The supporting cast is brilliant. Martin Sheen, Tom Skerritt, Anthony Zerbe, and the lovely Brooke Adams are all exceptional. Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam, who also penned such classics as Lost Boys, Lethal Weapon 2 and 3, and the Witches of Eastwick, crafted a brilliant treatment that works absolutely perfectly from start to finish. Michael Kamen's brilliant score is but one jewel in the crown of his many achievements, and was said to be so disturbing that overhearing him practicing it gave his neighbors nightmares.I suppose I could try to think of more ways to say it, but there is no need. It can be summed up once and for all in a single sentence. Dead Zone is perfection.

One film which doesn't fit that rule is The Dead Zone. In the hands of David Cronenberg, you may expect this to be a gore-filled affair, but it is actually a very well-made, subtle film which emphasises the psychological sense of fear rather than settling for blood-spattered mayhem. There isn't a moment in the film that will make you jump out of your seat, but it is still an effectively scary film because it plays on your mind. Normal, down-to-earth everyman Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) is involved in a terrible car crash which leaves him comatose. Four years later, he miraculously awakens. To begin with, he is devastated to learn that his girlfriend has moved on, marrying and starting a family with another man. But soon he realises that this is the least of his problems. He soon discovers that the accident has left him with remarkable powers, which enable him to see into people's futures just by touching their hand. And Johnny is in for one hell of a nasty shock when he shakes hands with potential senator Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) at a political rally.... An intelligently paced and very well-acted film, The Dead Zone is also full of unpredictable plot developments. Walken elicits great sympathy as the normal guy who rapidly learns that his new gift is actually a curse, and there are fabulous supporting performances from Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Brooke Adams and the terrifying Martin Sheen. The film has several tremendous moments, but the climax in particular builds to an emotional crescendo. The premise of The Dead Zone is probably rather silly if you stop to think about it, but other than that it is a most impressive film - and still ranks as one of, if not THE, best adaptation of a Stephen King story so far.

While the horror elements (including a suicide via scissors) carry an appropriate impact, the core of The Dead Zone is Walken's performance--he portrays Johnny as a recluse who regards his visions as a curse, and taps into a sensitivity and vulnerability that is rarely seen in male film characters; his interactions with others carry a down-home, plausible feel that gives the film a strong emotional resonance.

Who can forget the shambles that was Bonfire of the Vanities.In this case, having read both the book and seen the film, the differences between the two are negligible in my opinion. Although it was reported that there were several attempts at writing a screenplay due to differences between Cronenberg, Stephen King and others, the end product isn't too far from the theme and subject of the story itself.Walken was one of the few actors of this time that could envisage the pain and torture of having such a gift as second sight. The line he delivers - You know what God did for me.. while speaking to Skerrit who comments that God has seen fit to bless him with this gift shows Walkens true acting prowess. You can taste his bitterness and depression through this line alone. One cannot underrate this job for Walken as the book is far more descriptive and indulgent into the spells which Johnny Smith goes through as well as the roller-coaster that is his emotions.With the sub-plots in full swing such as tutoring the young boy, the castle rock killer and the eventual showdown with the soon to be president Sheen, the film flows in a nice even pace. This is interspersed with the delightful performance of Herbert Lom.If you haven't already seen this, you are in for a treat. It is far superior to other similar films such as Unbreakable.

Add Chris Walken near the top of his game, and the results should be fairly predictable - either an esoteric morasse of horror-poetry illustrated by Walken's incredible physical expressiveness, or powerful, disturbing and smart film. Fortunately, the Dead Zone is the latter.Johnny Smith (Walken) lives in Castle Rock Maine where he teaches school and is engaged to a nice local girl (Sarah - Brooke Adams). On his way home one night his Volkswagen is flattened by a jack-knifed truck. Smith experiences a severe brain trauma and slips into a coma which lasts several years. WHen he wakes up, it doesn't take long for him to slip into a deep depression because of all that has happened since his accident, nor does it take long for him to realize that physical contact with others often allows him to see their future.As with many of King's 1970s and early 1980s stories, halfway through the story, it is not clear whether the protagonist is to become a hero or a very very bad guy. Cronenberg uses this ambiguity perfectly and Walken (greatly aided by the script) makes his character both edgy and sympathetic.Walken gives this film everything he's got, and his performance is spot-on. The supporting cast is also excellent - especially Herbert Lom and Anthony Zerbe. Cronenberg, to his credit, sticks to the story this time around - apparently King gave him more than enough to work with and the uncontrollably creative director reigned himself in so that he could give the story the treatment it deserved. This film fits better among Cronenberg's later works such as A History of Violence and Eastern Promises than among Naked Lunch, ExistenZ or Videodrome. Even the cinematographic technique is unusually straightforward.The Dead Zone's script was written by the very talented Jeff Boam, who unfortunately succumbed to a rare disease at the age of 53 in 2000, after achieving a nearly unbroken nine-year streak of hit screenplays from the Dead Zone (1983) to Lethal Weapon 3 (1992).

Cronenberg plays director-for-hire as he adapts the novel with his own vision in mind. Even though he was only a hired gun, his trademark is everywhere. The movie has a cold and clinical feel to it. The book is the opposite of this movie, but it makes a interesting companion piece. Christopher Walken stars in the lead role as Johnny Smith. He's a school teacher who one day (after a terrible accident) is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to for see a certain future. Herbert Lom co-stars as his doctor and Brooke Adams co-stars as well as his former love interest. Martin Sheen plays in what's nothing more than an extended cameo appearance. He plays Greg Stiltson with restraint but with an underlining madness. Tom Skeritt co-stars as well as the constable who seeks out Johnny's help.The movie follows the book somewhat but there's something missing. Cronenberg takes the story and adds his own coldness to the overall film. The cinematography is very Norman Rockwell (in an interview he told his Director of Photography to accomplish this feat with his lens). The performance of Walken is also cold and clinical. I don't know if this was done on purpose or if that's just the way he acted during this time period.Despite the lack of involvement with writing the screenplay, this film has Cronenberg written all over it. But many of his fans (such as myself) will feel conflicted if they're fans of the book (such as myself). So it's up to you to decide how to feel about this movie. It's an interesting movie for horror fans in general but not necessarily for fans of Stephen King. All depends on one's taste I guess.

Five years later Johnny wakes up from his coma and discovers he has the psychic ability to see the future and the past and also change a person's outcome.The year 1983 was a great year for Author Stephen King because not only were his novels were bestsellers they were also being adapted for the big screen. In 1983,there was John Carpenter's effective and underrated haunted car adaptation Christine,Lewis Teague's entertaining Rabid dog tale Cujo and last but not least David Cronenberg's The Dead Zone. The Dead Zone is an amazing film that was the first and only time that Cronenberg and King collaborated on a film and but it was worth it because the movie is effective from beginning to end giving viewers a dark psychological Thriller,a tragic character driven Drama,a powerful Mystery and an intense Horror film all in one. This film is very suspenseful and intense in asking the question what if a human being were to have psychic powers and was able to see the future and change a person's outcome and the movie answers those questions with the greatest of ease giving viewers a film that is like Twilight Zone. This is a film that harms you not only physically but mentally as well and never letting you go. The film will disappoint Horror fans because despite The Dead Zone being directed by David Cronenberg and being based on a Stephen King book the movie isn't much of a Horror film in the traditional sense of the genre it still is but there's no gore or scares but TDZ still continues in the tradition of the Body Horror films like Cronenberg's Scanners,The Brood,Videodrome and later with The Fly but instead of focusing on the human body TDZ is about what goes on inside of the human mind. The atmosphere in TDZ is truly effective,somber and tragic using the Winter snow to great effect reflecting not only the main character's state of mind but isolation and sadness and having to deal with his new power. One of the things that is also wonderful about TDZ is the story and episodic nature because we not only see Johnny having to deal with his new power and trying to not only get back in society and see his old girlfriend Sarah(Brooke Adams)but we also try to see Johnny help a Sheriff(Tom Skerritt)solve various murders,Johnny trying to tutor and help young student Chris Stuart(Simon Craig),then Johnny has to deal with a politician named Greg Stillman(Martin Sheen)but despite the movie being episodic and having different subplots The Dead Zone never becomes uneven. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is amazing with Boam taking the task of adapting King's 400 page novel and doing it flawlessly keeping some of the key moments from the novel in the film while having the dialog real tight and the main characters feel real and memorable. The main character Johnny Smith is one of the greatest and saddest characters in a Stephen King film or book because when we see Johnny wake from his coma everything has changed and he's got this great power to see the future it's a blessing and curse to him and as we see Johnny recover he becomes more isolated and alone which adds to the tragedy and sadness of the character. We relate to Johnny because even though he wants to use his powers for psychic abilities for good he's in pain and is dying inside because of his amazing gift and as the movie goes on you will feel for the character. Johnny Smith is a classic and unforgettable character that you will remember after the movie is over. The ending of The Dead Zone is terrific,intense,tragic and surprising and is a fitting conclusion to the film. An amazing ending.The cast is terrific. Christopher Walken is excellent and at his best as Johnny Smith,with Walken bringing depth,sadness and sympathy to the role. Brooke Adams is wonderful as Sarah,Johnny's former girlfriend. Tom Skerritt is terrific as Sheriff Bannerman,a lawman asking for Johnny's help. Herbert Lom is outstanding as Dr. Sam Weizak,Johnny's Doctor. Martin Sheen is fantastic as Greg Stillman,a corrupt and sleazy politician. Anthony Zerbe is great as Roger Stuart,a man that hires Johnny to tutor his son. Simon Craig does a fine job as Chris Stuart,Roger's son. Nicolas Campbell(Frank Dodd),Colleen Dewhurst(Hennrietta Dodd),Sean Sullivan(Herb Smith),Jackie Burroughs(Vera Smith)and Peter Dvorsky(Dardis)give good performances as well.The direction by David Cronenberg is brilliant,with Cronenberg bringing a dark,haunting and tragic style to the film. Fabulous direction,Cronenberg.The score by Michael Kamen is outstanding,beautiful,dark and tragic matching the movie's tone to perfection. Powerful score,Kamen.In final word,if you love genre films,David Cronenberg,Stephen King or Christopher Walken,I highly suggest you see The Dead Zone,an excellent,suspenseful film that is Cronenberg,King and Walken at their best.

Furthermore, he realises he also has the power to change the future.This Stephen King adaption was one of the most mainstream efforts from Canadian director David Cronenberg. After the problems he experienced with the release of his previous film Videodrome, Cronenberg decided to be a director for hire for his next feature and in the process relinquished writing duties, while reigning in his more visceral tendencies. He wanted to just get a film out there without the problematic distribution issues he had with his previous film. Adapting a King novel was just the ticket as far as that was concerned, as at the time King was probably the most popular author on the planet. So, unsurprisingly, The Dead Zone, while admittedly more of a sleeper than a smash hit, did a lot better business than Videodrome and it gave Cronenberg more commercial leverage. It's a much more watered down Cronenberg film in fairness, much less personal. Nevertheless, it is still noticeably a fusion of Cronenberg and King. Because while it is true to the ideas of the writer, it has aspects of the director as well, such as the cold Canadian setting (despite being set in the USA it was filmed in Canada), the way that the psychic phenomena is dealt with in a serious way and the idea of a man trapped in a body that is changing uncontrollably.Christopher Walken is excellent in the lead role. He contributes a huge amount in what is a fairly in-depth character. At its heart, the Dead Zone is, after all, a sad story about a man who suffers loss in a very unusual way. It looks at how he copes with waking up from a coma to find everything has changed and also with the manner in which his strange powers are a curse to him. Walken really gets to the heart of this character and is the emotional core of the film. The cast generally, is a better one than Cronenberg had been used to. The larger budget meant that we also have Herbert Lom as Walken's doctor, an understated Tom Skerritt as a policeman and an over-the-top Martin Sheen as a corrupt politician.It's a far less visceral film than any of Cronenberg's earlier work and, for me, less interesting overall. The supernatural plot-line is not something you would associate with the director who always goes for a more science fiction based approach, although the film often feels more sci-fi than supernatural as a result of Cronenberg's overall approach. It is sometimes quite inventive visually though, particularly the vision sequences. Walken finds himself in the scene itself as he observes it, which lends a strange dream-like tone which works really well. The plot is made up of several self-contained parts within an overall whole. The best was the murder investigation sub-plot which was quite chilling and could have been expanded if anything, while the least effective for me was the final part involving the corrupt politician. Sheen is too one-dimensionally evil and clichéd a character for this movie and the whole sequence of him initiating nuclear war seemed strangely poorly done. But this criticism aside, The Dead Zone still remains a quality 80's sci-fi thriller. It lacks the sheer originality and directness of Cronenberg's best work but by most other directors standards it's a pretty good one.

Both movies take silly thriller material and make something poetic out of it. Psycho is essentially a black joke; The Dead Zone is a love story.That's what I take from it every time I see it. It's a movie about a high school teacher named Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) who emerges from a coma after five years with psychic powers. He later crosses paths with a serial killer, still later a megalomaniac capable of blowing up half the world. And yet this is a movie about people, and it's a love story.How did they do it? In the first reel, with just a few deft touches, this movie establishes that Johnny and Sarah Bracknell (Brooke Adams) love each other. And we really feel it. Is it the dialogue, the performances, the music? Is it the way it's shot and edited? It's all these things, I guess. There's a scene where Johnny and Sarah stand at her doorway. It's pouring rain. She invites him to stay the night, but he says, Better not. And later, Some things are worth the wait. Why such diffidence? We figure out later that it may be his strict religious upbringing. But the movie never says so explicitly.Many things in the film are implied. This fosters the illusion that the people and events exist somewhere outside the confines of the frame. Does Johnny have latent psychic abilities before the car accident? Well, he has a weird headache while riding a roller coaster with Sarah. Is he predicting what's about to happen to him on the road? Probably, but the movie never hammers the point.Is Johnny's mother latently psychic, too? The movie makes a couple of very tiny suggestions to this effect. She feels his pain very strongly in one scene; in another she's either having an hallucination or a psychic vision when she sees Johnny in the hospital room not as he is now but in the house, wearing boots and tracking in snow.Walken's performance is so important to this movie. He's a quirky actor, as we all know. Here all his choices are unpredictable, yet invariably and uncannily right. And despite his creepy persona, he's enormously sympathetic. He's an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation; we believe it and feel strongly for him. (After discovering this movie, it will be hard for me to watch him again in later movies, caricaturing himself.)Brooke Adams is an appealing actress with an enormous smile. Most importantly, she, as Sarah, convincingly loves Johnny. She runs out into the rain just to grab Johnny and say, I'm so crazy about you. The music swells, and it's all so terribly corny, except &#x85; it isn't. It's a lovely moment, and we believe it.David Cronenberg, who directs, wrings deft performances from all his actors &#x96; from the major supporting players like Herbert Lom, who plays Johnny's doctor, and the low-key Tom Skerritt, who plays a sheriff &#x96; to the tiny cameos. There's the nurse with the saucer eyes whose daughter is in unexpected danger. There's the physical therapist who encourages Johnny to chug chug. There's the great Colleen Dewhurst playing the small role of an evil mother. There's Sean Sullivan and Jackie Burroughs playing Johnny's parents; he is naturalistic, she stylized, an odd but oddly appropriate pairing. I wish I had the space to keep going.The one character and performance I don't like is Martin Sheen's Greg Stillson. He seems like a caricature created by someone inordinately frightened of evangelism, the kind of person who quakes in his boots every time a Reagan or a Bush mentions God. Nevertheless, his effect on Johnny and the plot are important. And caricature or not, his fate proves to be very satisfying; and it paves the way for the ending, which is rightly about Johnny and Sarah.Cronenberg handles suspense so deftly, it's inspiring how good he is. I'll just point out two things. One is the device of the handshakes &#x96; sometimes one will cause a vision, sometimes not. Cronenberg and his scenarist, Jeffrey Boam, wisely fill the movie with plenty of handshakes, always keeping us on edge, wondering, Is it going to happen this time, is it, is it? Two is the scene when we don't know if a certain character is still alive or dead. The camera pulls back from that character's father, and we look around the room for him. Where is he? Is he alive? We're in agony. Hitchcock could not have handled it better.As in Psycho, the music score is essential. It's impossible to imagine either movie without it. Michael Kamen's score is alternately mournful, romantic, creepy. He adds special excitement to the vision sequences, and gives each one its own particular quality. For the gazebo murder, for instance, it somehow sounds as if the music is going backwards.Nothing replaces or supersedes Hitchcock's nightmarish masterpiece. But this movie, for all its sadness, horror and tragedy, has a less cynical nature. It's about love and doing the right thing.

A lot of scenes are obviously shortened, like starting in the middle of a conversation, or ending abruptly without being properly resolved. Best example here the last scene, where Sara's I love you, Johnny is obviously voiced-over. (Several sources claim that Cronenberg had shot an ending similar to the one in the novel, with Sara visiting Johnny's grave and suddenly having a kind of vision of Johnny standing next to her, but he had to cut it, because otherwise the film would have been too long.)The editing, too, looks like someone tried to speed up the movie instead of using the original pace. It's a shame, with all the creative input by the great cast and Cronenberg himself.17 years after The Dead Zone, King-movies like The Green Mile run for about three hours and thus perfectly capture the mood and the pace of King's novels.Production executives out there, if you read this - give novel adaptations the time they need. - give us a Director's Cut of The Dead Zone.

Although his performance in `The Deer Hunter' is breathtaking in `The Dead Zone' he had the extra challenge of the supernatural. This is where the new show on USA goes awry.  The new TV show deals purely with nearly intangible plot material whereas the original movie was based solely on Johnny's inner torment. He hated his newfound vision.  He hated the fact that he was now different- that most others deemed him a freak.  I can see how this character's life could be stretched into a TV series. The brilliant original film is in its nature episodic.  However, the modern interpretation of Johnny Smith is incorrect and too hopeful.

Well-crafted but oddly COLD (as are many of Cronenberg's films), THE DEAD ZONE DOES boast one unforgettable scene the scene where Sheen snatches up the baby to use as a shield. It's a quintessential Political move- especially in this Day and Age. Like it or not, we live in what Norman Mailer, writing in CANNIBALS AND CHRISTIANS, called a world whose ultimate logic is war, because in a world of war all overproduction and overpopulation is possible since people and commodities may be destroyed wholesale. THE DEAD ZONE suggests, too, that a Psychological Evaluation of potential Political Leaders might be in order. Politics, wrote Mailer, was the place where finally nobody meant what they said- it was a world of nightmare; psychopaths roved. As for World War Three (there've been so MANY World Wars, from Vietnam to Iraq to Afghanistan to what-day-of-the-week-is-it?, that it's hard to keep track), said Mailer One's own suicide might be lost in a national suicide.

He is suffering from headaches. After dropping off his girlfriend Sarah Bracknell (Brooke Adams), he gets into a car accident which puts him into a coma. He wakes up 5 years later to find Sarah married with a child. He discovers that he is clairvoyant when he touches some people. Sheriff Bannerman (Tom Skerritt) seeks his help with some murders. The case leaves him shot and disabled. He tries to live in isolation. He has a vision of a boy falling through a frozen pond and is able to change the future. It's a dead zone in his visions. Then he sees politician Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) as a President starting total nuclear war and it becomes a moral question of what he should do.This is not actually a horror or has any scary moments. There is one pretty bloody scene with a grotesque suicide. This is more of a thinking Stephen King tale. Christopher Walken is able to come across as creepy as well as sympathetic. Without him, this movie wouldn't work. Director David Cronenberg injects good tension and good creepiness into this simple story.

Foreseeing the future appears to be a 'gift' at first, but ends up causing problems. Roger Ebert wrote The Dead Zone does what only a good supernatural thriller can do It makes us forget it is supernatural. Like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, it tells its story so strongly through the lives of sympathetic, believable people that we not only forgive the gimmicks, we accept them. There is pathos in what happens to the Christopher Walken character in this movie and that pathos would never be felt if we didn't buy the movie's premise. The Dead Zone is an excellent, suspenseful film that is Cronenberg, King and Walken at their best.

Most of his novels that are made into movies are failures, but not this one. The movie captures your attention from the beginning until the very end.

Christopher Walken takes you through a wide range of emotions as a reluctant psychic. The key to this film is the wonderful acting by all the players. Brooke Adams as the ex-girlfriend exudes the emotion of a woman with a confused heart in a way rarely seen on screen. The scene at the gazebo where Johnny Smith (Walken) might see the killer with his psychic abilities is astounding. The movie flows smoothly and gives you a clear understanding of how this type of psychic power affects moods, emotions and lives. Although not a big role, Martin Sheen as the sociopathic political wannabe is hands down his finest character. The savior-like ending that precipitates world history is brilliant and mind blowing. Movies combining sci-fi and heart felt drama are hard to come by. This one has it all. Keep it in your DVD library. The DVD picture is decent but the sound could use improvement. A special edition containing the original movie poster artwork and many extras is greatly needed. You will enjoy it.

It's absolutely hilarious as he parodies those intense moments when he grabs someone's hand and goes into a visionary trance. That's one of the reasons I tuned into this flick the other day, just to see Walken once again do his 'Dead Zone' thing.I actually like the film as it has a pretty good set up for entering the realm of the paranormal and then expanding on Johnny's abilities to see and then impact the future. I didn't much care for the accident scene that put Johnny into a coma; it didn't seem all that realistic given the technology movies have now, but no use crying over spilt milk.The finale was very well done to the extent that even though it looked like Johnny failed to kill a would be megalomaniac like Stillson (Martin Sheen), he did in fact accomplish his mission to stop Stillson from getting elected. That was a subtle twist that made the ending more satisfying than if he had outright eliminated the would be Senator. What made no sense at all though was the utter lack of any kind of security or police presence at the rally, especially after the shooting. To me, that's even more unbelievable than accepting someone having Johnny's uncanny ability to see what happens next.

The movie was very engrossing and kept you riveted right up until the end. The production was masterful - very well-directed, well-paced, and intelligent. The dialog seemed all too real - not like anything that seemed stilted or manufactured. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a first-rate drama that is free of clichés.

Considering I haven't read the book version, I'm not making any comparisons. The Dead Zone tells a story about a guy who wakes up from coma, after five years, with the power to see the future. Nowadays it wouldn't sound any original, but I realize it was for the time it was released. I admit there are some poor moments in this film made in a rush, without much development for the characters. We just can't know if Johnny was a good or a bad guy until the final twist-- which was, in my opinion, just BRILLIANT. Even thought Christopher Walken plays the main character, I think Martin Sheen just STOLE the scene with big portrayal of the shift politician that intends to incinerate American's population for no particular reason-- in a first sight, at least. To sum it up, I agree the movie isn't that great, but it's undoubtedly GOOD, mostly because of the surprising ending that I don't care who wrote-- King or filmmakers.

One night he is involved in a terrible car accident and spends five years in a coma. He wakes up to find himself weak and hobbled, his job gone and the girl he loved married to another man. He also finds he has the ability to read into a person's past and future upon touching them. He successfully warns a nurse of a house fire and correctly sees his doctor's mother, long thought to be dead in war-torn Germany, to be very much alive.Johnny finds his gift is very much a curse, as each episode drains him physically and he is regarded as a freak. Despite initial resistance, he agrees to help the town sheriff solve a series of serial murders in town known as the Castle Rock killings. He successfully reveals the sheriff's deputy to be the culprit and is shot by the deputy's mother during his attempted apprehension. Scarred from the event, he moves to a neighboring town.While here, he sees Senator Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen)at a campaign rally. Upon shaking his hand, Johnny sees Stillson as a fanatical politician aiming to win the presidency and start global warfare. Knowing from past episodes that he not only can predict the future but also PREVENT it, Johnny realizes it falls upon him to try and stop Stillson.The Dead Zone is an effective, yet terribly sad movie. Christopher Walken is excellent, portraying Johnny as a lonely, shattered man terribly hurt by the past. He is a good person whose world has fallen apart due to tragic circumstances. Watching him see his old girlfriend- a pretty young woman he was prepared to marry- now married to another man, is heartbreaking, as is his solitary existence. Fine character work is turned in by Martin Sheen as the ruthless Stillson, and Herbert Lom and Brooke Adams as Johnny's doctor and love interest respectively.

It retains its heart while remaining an interesting and subtly spooky story.Christopher Walken is nicely cast in an Everyman type of role - he is named Johnny Smith, after all, a generic name if ever there was one - a teacher who lives through a horrible traffic accident only to spend the next five years in a coma and to wake up with a newfound ability to predict the fates of others by making physical contact with them. He comes to regard it as a curse, wanting only to left alone, until coming into horrifying knowledge of the future, and realizing that he can do something about it.The film is well acted all the way down the line, with Walken creating a well rounded character who earns our sympathies. Brooke Adams is likewise endearing as Sarah, the love of his life. Tom Skerritt appears as a sheriff faced with a series of murders who turns to Johnny for help. Herbert Lom is great as the kindly doctor who cares for Johnny. Anthony Zerbe is fine in the role of a rich man who hires Johnny as a tutor for his son. And Martin Sheen is memorably scary as the pushy politician whom Johnny comes to regard as dangerous.Folks who love the more outré and gruesome horror of King and Cronenbergs' other works may be surprised - pleasantly or not - at the more serious and mature nature of this story, which is absorbing every step of the way. It includes some great twists and turns and makes the viewer what will happen to Johnny from scene to scene. The pacing is so good and the tale so involving that the time just flies by. It was a credit to Cronenberg then, and remains so, that he could spin a yarn with such a heavy emotional quality (prefiguring The Fly by a few years). There are many arresting scenes, especially when Johnny is experiencing his psychic visions. And everything builds to a shattering conclusion that will have the audience on the edges of their seats.Overall, this is a very good film, more a drama with touches of horror than the typical horror movie. It's well worth a viewing. It was the second of three King adaptations to hit the screen in 1983, preceded by Cujo and followed by Christine.Eight out of 10.

He decides to help a sheriff (Tom Skerritt) trying to find a serial killer who has been terrorizing the town. At first this power is used for good but soon he sees something that will make him face a moral dilemma. David Cronenberg's THE DEAD ZONE remains not only one of the best Stephen King adaptations but I also think it's one of the director's best films. The movie is part drama, part horror, part political thriller and everything adds up to a very satisfying movie that has a lot going for it. I think the film works on whatever level or genre it's tackling and the start of the film is perfectly handled by the director as we see what kind of impact this ability has on the main character. We see and really get to understand what it would be like waking up five years after an accident and not being able to move on in that time like those around you have been able to. The middle portion of the film dealing with the serial killer is masterfully done and contains some of the best suspense you're going to see from any film of this era. Then, the final act dealing with a dirty politician (Martin Sheen) has a twist at the end that is just downright perfect. It certainly helps that you have such a strong cast with Walken leading the way. I thought he was extremely good here and especially early on as he struggles to get on with his life after the accident. Of course, he also handles the downfall of this character as well as all the negative stuff that comes along with this gift. Sheen is perfect as the evil guy and you can just see in his eyes the cold nature of his character. Brooke Adams is also very good as the love interest and we also get a strong performance from Herbert Lom. There are a few slow spots in the movie that keeps it from being a great film but these issues are certainly minor enough not to spoil anything too much. THE DEAD ZONE is certainly one of the better looks at this gift some people have and I think Cronenberg and King fit each other very nicely.

Told in essentially four chapters, each woven into the story of Christopher Walken's character whose near-fatal auto accident propels him into a foreboding state where he can (reluctantly) anticipate tragedy, an affliction that consumes his existence and purpose until he foresees an event that he's compelled to prevent.Stellar cast includes the always-intense Walken, who becomes almost a reclusive freak as his clairvoyance gains notoriety, husky-voiced Brooke Adams as his pre-accident girlfriend and a top-drawer supporting cast that includes Martin Sheen as a megalomaniacal presidential candidate, Anthony Zerbe, Herbert Lom, Tom Skerritt and Colleen Dewhurst.To attract a cast of that calibre, you either need to possess a potent product, or be filming somewhere exotic and while the Canadian locations are distinctive, I daresay it's the quality of the production that has lured the impressive talent. Gripping and eerie, it's the King-Cronenberg collaboration to renew your confidence in holding out great expectations of such partnerships, throw in a cast of substantial depth and enough suspense, super-naturalism, horror and heroism to fulfil the promise.

This is because the story is a biography of the Walken character, and Walken brings the character to life.Walken is a schoolteacher and normal guy ready to marry Brooke. He has a car accident, not his fault, and goes into a coma lasting 5 years. When he awakes, he has a psychic power. By touching someone, he can see what is happening elsewhere to their loved ones or has happened to them in the hidden past and what will happen in the future. The ability depends on imponderables. To have this happen all the time would be very wearing on a person and take possession of their mind.The story is not really one story, except that it's the story of how he responds to and handles this curse or gift, as he views it. The movie is broken into distinct parts or episodes. Only one of these keeps running in the background, providing a bit of continuity, and that's the story of Sheen, who harbors a demented personality that could become president and set off a nuclear war. The Brooke Adam romance also continues, but it's secondary, even though it does involve the viewer.The episodes involve his sight regarding a nurse, Lom, a serial killer, Zerbe and his son, and finally Sheen. Sheen, by the way, is a standout, his part affording him ample opportunity to inhabit the role of a populist candidate with a high degree of hatred and simple-minded thinking. The story grinds to a halt mid-way when Walken helps resolve the serial killer case, but one doesn't really notice this because it goes back into deepening Walken's personal reactions to his power, and that's the real story of the movie How does such a power affect a person?King's work here is a work of imagination and pointing out a possibility and then exploring its human consequences. I like Walken's natural style of acting and underplaying, and he has the charisma to get one involved in the implausible happenings. There is not much suspense to the proceedings, or even horror thrills. It's neither one of those kinds of movies. It's more an exploration of normal people facing the abnormal. It provides a satisfying look at that. People handle it well.

The set up is pure science fiction thriller, as Johnny Smith (the worst name in cinema history) awakens from a coma to learn that he has a psychic ability. Smith, portrayed by Christopher Walken, is able to capture glimpses of the horror in people's lives when he touches their hands. This gift is able to bring joy to the lives of some, but being a film it naturally produces mostly conflict.The premise would set itself up for a relatively traditional narrative structure, but I found it interesting how the film was more episodic than you would expect. Smith comes into contact with several people, from his doctor to a local boy whom he begins to tutor, and with each new encounter comes another crisis for him to attempt to reconcile. It's more of a character study than anything else, initially focusing on the anguish of a man who awakens from a five year coma to a world much different than he remembers, and later becoming about the emotional damage one with such a gift, or curse would have to face.The local people have varied reactions to Smith's newfound ability, from the Sheriff asking for his help in serial killings, to others refusing to go near him out of fear or disbelief. It puts Smith into a secluded state, where even the people he cares about view him as something not quite human anymore, and Walken portrays it all with a touching vulnerability. Eventually the story works itself around to a more centered focus, as Smith enters into a confrontation with Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen), a senatorial candidate who is using fear as his main motivator to gather votes.The film works primarily as a character study, but there's an interesting political commentary that is achieved through the Stillson character that added yet another layer to it all. In writing the character of Stillson, they were smart to make him from a third party, thus allowing the film to be not a propaganda of one political party but instead a chastising of politics at large. Stillson is a diabolical villain, played with excellent malice by Sheen, and the film uses him as a way to tear down the fear mongering that can drive political candidates. Cronenberg's The Dead Zone is a film that starts out with relatively conventional roots but slowly evolves into something much more intelligent and intimate than you would expect. "},{"Title":"Cronenberg most conventional film is still fantastic thriller!","Date":"18 December 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" David Cronenberg is undeniably one of the greatest directors who was ever active in the genres of horror, thriller and cult cinema. Especially from the mid-70's until the late 80's, he made some of the most unbelievably fascinating and original movies there are to find out there. And even though I do think that The Dead Zone is also a truly fantastic movie, and perhaps still one of the most shamefully underrated thrillers of the 1980's, it's definitely Cronenberg's most conventional and simultaneously least personal accomplishments ever. The Dead Zone is a fine adaptation of Stephen King's graphic novel, and up until then Cronenberg always wrote his own scenarios. The script of this movie is also a lot less extravagant, weird and psycho-nightmarish as his previous efforts. And yet, as said, this is a solid and absorbing thriller with a continuously unsettling atmosphere, multiple genuine shock effects and mesmerizing acting performances. Christopher Walken, in one of this most illustrious roles to date, plays a sympathetic school teacher who gets involved in a dreadful car accident one rainy night. He awakens from a coma five years later and, even though he sadly lost his fiancée to another man, he did obtain some peculiar psychic powers. Through physical contact with someone, Johnny Smith sees visions of what (tragic) fate will overcome this person. Although initially a curse, Johnny eventually uses his powers to help solve police cases, prevent personal dramas and even &#x96; in a way &#x96; save the world. After a downright perplexing first half hour, The Dead Zone sort of becomes a mini-anthology. The film reaches its apex during the first episode, in which Johnny helps Sheriff Tom Skeritt with the unmasking of a perverted serial killer. This part of the film is almost indescribably grim, gripping and suspenseful. After this, the script weakens a bit because our protagonists adventures become more sentimental and political. Still, Cronenberg and company nevertheless keep a tremendously great finale in store. Christopher Walken can depend on a strong supportive cast, including veterans like Herbert Lom and Martin Sheen.

In the midst of this, his girlfriend has married someone else though she still loves him, he develops a friendship with a boy he tutors, and we follow him trying to deal with the changes to his life that especially the power he now has(and the religious people in his area react to it) causes. All this is well and good, except we don't particularly care. On the whole, this is not as emotionally involving as it should be. The story lacks drive, and the characters don't go through any real changes. This is a brilliant concept, and it raises important ethical questions. It deserves a better execution. I haven't read the novel or watched the show. On the plus side, you can still tell this is Cronenberg. It has an effective eerie quality to it, it's beautifully shot, edited and scored and there is real tension to portions of this. The acting is great(this may be the best performance by Walken), for all in this(even the kids), with Sheen as a stand-out with his intense portrayal of a Senator candidate. This has OK humor. The FX are well-done, and seeing Christopher go in and out of the second sight is genuinely chilling, done with sound, close-ups and cutting, rather than gratuitous visuals. There is a bit of disturbing content and bloody violence in this. I recommend this to big fans of the idea who want a film version of it. 7/10 "},{"Title":"King Plus Walken Plus Cronenberg Equals Win","Date":"12 October 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" A man (Christopher Walken) gets in a car accident and goes into a coma. Upon awaking five years later, he has lost his job and his girlfriend, but has gained the ability to see hidden events from a person's past, present or future. Of course, these may not always be good things.Here we have a trifecta of greatness Stephen King, David Cronenberg and Christopher Walken. King's work can go either good or bad, but in the hands of Cronenberg and fleshed out by Walken, this really is a great film. Not just a great horror film (it's not much of one) but a great film in general.Howard Maxford calls it a slick psychic thriller with strong performances, and I agree wholeheartedly. With supporting cast members like Martin Sheen, Herbert Lom and Tom Skerritt, how could this not be talent pushed to its limits? The gore is very limited, as are the scares, making this almost more of a suspense thriller than a flat-out horror. But it does contain a very nasty suicide scene that is not to be missed. (It's not as explicit as it could be, but enough that you'll get the drift of its painfulness.) This film had been sitting on my to see pile for a long time now. Christopher Walken's starring role made me want to see it, but when I realized Cronenberg was behind it, it was a must-see. And i was not disappointed... you really do need to see it! (Besides, if you don't see this, you won't fully appreciate one of the skits from SNL's Best of Christopher Walken.)

Directed by David Cronenberg, the 'Master of Body-Horror' shows the interesting aspects of interior torment with a great Christopher Walken leading on. The film's preoccupation with the deeply involved Walken works definitely to its benefit, the actor turns out a heartfelt performance of a man whose life changes radically after an incident; it's off course his telepathic abilities, but also the way he returns from a coma after five years and finds his true love married with children. Later on, the film also presents a political arrow of a crazed senator who aims for president. A great film.

Did Cronenburg really make this film in between Videodrome and The Fly? And what happened after the Dead Zone? Why nothing for three years? Don't misunderstand me. I really enjoyed the film. It's very accomplished directing, but it is so mainstream! It's all a bit wholesome. Christian metaphor of the chosen one laying down his life to save the world - even though the predictable, typically American take on this includes assassinating the evil one. It's almost as if Cronenburg was proving he could do conventional if he had to. But now it just looks like an aberration in his output. Thank goodness he didn't decide to continue ploughing this furrow. Walken, Sheen and Adams are all superb. I couldn't help laughing when Sheen has to say that he has had a vision of becoming President.

I can say that I would like to read the book someday as the movie was rather good. Not the best story in the world, but then the book would probably flesh out more details and such that would have made the plot more entertaining. However, what makes this one particularly good is the characters as it stars Christopher Walken and lets face it, even in a bad movie he is totally cool and great. This movie is not bad, just not all that great. In this one a dude has a brush with death and develops a psychic power that he uses to try and stop things from happening. There are a couple of good little flashes one involving a bloody bath tub and another involving and nasty fire. However, the story kind of loses its fast and frenetic pace as it bogs down on this one guy vying to be president. I just think that the film was at its best when our hero was first discovering his powers and going from one vision to another rather than the whole political thing. Still, it was not a total loss as I enjoyed the ending to this one as despite what happens the hero gets the peace of mind that he did what he could. It would be interesting to read this though one day and find out more details of some of the character's lives that one can only gain insight from by reading the book.

The Dead Zone is a very much underrated and unheralded movie - never do you hear it been mentioned in the higher echelon of films. Maybe it is my own personal twisted choice of what films are good or not - but this certainly should be considered a classic.Cronenberg is a strange director and I must confess - I am not really a fan. But this is sublime - the atmospheric approach to the film is brilliant, the camera-work exquisite and the direction spot on. No cheap thrills here - just solid story-telling and direction. I think this was his first foray into main-stream movie-making - and for me it remains his best by far.The acting too is tremendous. Walken is on top-form here as Johnny Smith - a common name for a guy with uncommon powers. His presence on screen is unquestionable. In this film he is not an actor playing a role - but he quite literally IS JOHNNY SMITH. A great turn by Martin Sheen and good back-up by Herbert Lom, Brooke Adams (looking great) and Tom Skerrit as Bannerman. My only quibble would be that Skerrit and Anthony Zerbe (who plays the dad of a boy whom Johnny is tutoring) look very alike on screen making it hard for me to distinguish them. A tiny quibble.The Stephen King story is brilliant - and with Walken at the top of his game here (Check out 'The ice is gonna break' scene for sheer intensity) and this film is near perfect.I gave it 9/10 .... before I wrote this comment.....Now I cannot remember why I knocked a point off. Well worth a watch - brilliant. "}{"Title":"Dead man Walken?","Date":"24 September 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Based on the superior chiller from Stephen King, The Dead Zone was perhaps more surprising for horror fans upon it's release for showing a previously unseen restraint and impressive delicacy from director David Cronenberg (best known at the time for the likes of Scanners, Videodrome and other body horrors).It also, for better or worse, cemented Christopher Walken's reputation as THE guy to play edgy and intense characters. Here he is Johnny Smith, an accident victim who gradually realises when he awakes from his coma that he can sense things about people as soon as he touches them. It's a gift/curse that comes and goes but when it hits him as strongly as it can then he has to do something to affect change in the lives of those affected, be they potential victims of tragedy or potential harbingers of doom (in the case of Martin Sheen, playing slippery Greg Stillson).It's simply a great adaptation of a great novel and, while purists may complain about changes to the source material, remains one of the best movies about premonitions, fate and the sacrifices that often have to be made to instigate great change.Walken is superb in the lead role, arguably one of his most memorable, and while the rest of the cast all do well things lead to a head with the situation between Johnny Smith and Greg Stillson, allowing Sheen to give a fantastic performance that perhaps suffers slightly from the lack of subtlety that King can instill in some of his characters but that still makes for a great showpiece for Sheen.Seen as a horror movie it works well, seen as a Stephen King adaptation it's up there with the best, seen as a movie of import in director David Cronenberg's oeuvre it's definitely worth high praise indeed - much like Peter Jackson's The Frighteners this movie provided an essential stepping stone for a director to stay working within a genre often looked down upon while also showing they could make a product that could appeal to audiences in great numbers.See this if you like The Medusa Touch, Patrick, Donnie Darko.

It is terribly sad and introspective. What does a man do who has lost five years of his life? A man who should not be alive. A man who has been given the power to foresee the tragic consequences of a person's placement on this earth. Christopher Walken plays the part with reserve and sympathy. He knows what is going on. He knows what five years can do to relationships. He knows that he may want to end his life because there is nothing for him. He goes through the standard raft of attempts to use his powers positively. The exhaustion of not being believed like Cassandra wears at his soul. Then we have the politician whose powers will unleash mayhem on the world. He has to do something, but how? What can he do with his limited effect on the world. This has one of the best concluding scenes of any movie. The sadness comes from a fine person being dealt this kind of hand. I think of John Travolta's character in Phenomenon. You become part of someone else. You become a gift to society. You become a tool. Considering what John Smith goes through initially, he shouldn't be answerable to anyone. This is a well done, captivating film.

It would have taken 4 to 5 hours to get all of the detail of the book into the movie, but certain aspects of the book could have been focused on more. The one thing that did stand out in the movie was Walken's performance, which was the best dramatic performance of his I've ever seen. So the movie is worth the purchase just for that. Oh, in closing, this is not a horror movie, nor was the book horror. The book was the closest thing to a comic book style story that King has ever written, with the message of With great power comes great responsibility dominating the story.

As for overall creepiness, this film isn't one to scare your socks off... but it is very enjoyable in that nobody could really sit there and laugh at it and predict everything going on. Cronenberg shoots the film more in the style of Kubrick's King adaptation The Shining, rather than imposing his own brand of sick horror onto the story.All in all, a very enjoyable experience, with nice cameos by other Cronenberg regulars like Les Carlson, Peter Dvorsky, and Herbert Lom playing a psychiatrist, reversing the role that he had in so many of the Pink Panther films.7/10 "},{"Title":"The ice is GOING TO BREAK!!!","Date":"13 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  Excellent movie.What would you do if you could affect the future?

It is restrained, elegant, and contains no sexual overtones and minimal blood and gore.  It was the movie that made me really appreciate Christopher Walken.  This came out the same time as another film featuring him as a sympathetic, tortured individual (Brainstorm).  In that movie, he played a scientist; in Dead Zone, he's a school teacher, but they are more or less the same character.  The film is not particularly scary, but it is extremely suspenseful, and seeing Martin Sheen as an evil Presidential candidate may be hard to take for his West Wing fans.  The book was episodic, and the film has a tendency to be that way too (no surprise that the book was adapted again for a cable TV series a few years ago).  But the performances--Walken, Sheen, Tom Skerrit, Brooke Adams, Herbert Lom, Anthony Zerbe--make up for this minor fault.  It's interesting to note that both Walken and Zerbe would play James Bond villains later in the decade, and Walken would play the Headless Horseman in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, which is the book he assigns to his class in Dead Zone, before his tragic accident.

The first one frightened me so much I couldn't watch that sequence again.After seeing the vision of Stillson starting a nuclear war, Johnny must wrestle with the question of whether or not he should use the power he has to alter the future by eliminating Greg Stillson. He ultimately chooses to do so by gunning Stillson down at a rally in the next town. Unfortunately his plans go awry when he misses and is gunned down by Stillson's thugs. Stillson, however, had grabbed Sarah's (Brooke Adams, as Johnny's former fiancee) infant son and used him as a human shield. What none of them had seen was a photographer taking pictures of Stillson's despicable act, and when Johnny touches Stillson's hand he sees the photo on the cover of a U.S. national magazine. In a second he realizes he has succeeded in stopping Stillson. Sarah comes over to Johnny and whispers, 'I love you', just before his death, in a very touching scene.One of the visions that appeared in the novel was that of a grad party which included a boy Johnny had been tutoring. In the novel, the boy had attended the party only to be killed in a fire started by a lightning strike on the restaurant where the party was being held. This was replaced in the film by Johnny seeing his younger student drown while playing hockey. As in the novel, Johnny manages to prevent his student's death by talking his father out of it. While the sequence in the movie was well done, I would have liked to see the original from the book. Nevertheless, the movie's most powerful line is delivered here by Walken in a shattering manner 'The ICE is gonna BREAK!' Michael Kamen's alternately sad and terrifying score is excellently woven into the film, especially the sequences involving Johnny and Sarah.Walken's portrayal of Johnny is amazing as a man whose life has been turned upside-down by the loss of so many people he loved, not to mention losing 5 years of his life and gaining an unwanted psychic ability. This was a different role for him than his ones as the twisted Max Zorin (A View to a Kill), or Frank White (King of New York). It was nice to see him as the good guy for once. Martin Sheen also does a great job as the vile Stillson, in another sharp contrast to his current role as President in 'The West Wing' TV series. Brooke Adams is also stellar in her role as Sarah, torn between her love for Johnny and a need to move on with her life.The Dead Zone is an excellent film; for a Cronenberg movie it has surprisingly little gore. However, what gore there is is essential to the story. It is an alternately sad and genuinely scary movie that seems to contain at least some of the elements of a classic literary tragedy.

And for the first fifty minutes The Dead Zone doesn't disappoint. The plot involves Johnny Smith (Walken) who after a very bad road accident is left comatose for five years, when he finally awakes he realises that he has been cursed with second sight. Originally Johnny uses his new found power for good, helping Tom Skerritt's local sheriff catch a serial killer, but whilst on the hunt, Johnny is wounded once more and decides to leave the crime fighting to the police. This is where the plot gets a little dull, I would have liked to see Johnny solving more crimes, and the idea of the serial killer hunt was very appealing. The second act I mentioned has Johnny working as a tutor to a young boy whose father has connections with Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen). This leads us into the much more interesting third act, as Johnny realises Stillson's true ulterior motive, giving us a very satisfactory climax, Johnny must face the fact that his condition is never going to allow him a normal life, as he comes to terms with the sacrifice he must make. The Dead Zone is an interesting and at times brilliant film, with only that one nagging flaw in the middle. 7/10 "},{"Title":"great movie","Date":"24 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  this is a movie witch should get an 10+ the story is well written and the characters are very good. especially christopher walken is playing very well. its a pity that his performances are not noticed in holland that much. but anyway...he's a good actor. hope to see a lot of movies of him.

Christopher Walken's performance is great; he gives one of the most convincing portrayals of anguish that I have seen, particularly in the scene where Brooke Adams comes to visit him, and when he mocks the proposition that the motor accident that injured him was a gift. I also think that Brooke Adams, who is one of my favourite actresses and who barely gets a mention in the comments that have been posted, is excellent; it is easy to see why Walken has never lost his love for her.But the movie is not perfect by any measure. The ending is melodramatic (I am referring to the attempted assassination of the politician and its aftermath) and hurried, and the staging has a look of cheapness about it. Also the histories of the characters do not seem to add up; for example Walken, who is a teacher and an educated, intelligent man, was engaged to Brooke Adams, who eventually marries a very working-class man. And it is too coincidental that she and her husband end up on stage with the politician at the crucial moment-- with their baby, what's more.I rate it 7.5 out of 10, or 2 to 3 stars on the Halliwell scale.

Some of the visions were so terrifying that I couldn't breathe for a minute.Walken is great here in the lead role and he is supported by a durable cast (Brooke Adams, Herbert Lom, Tom Skerritt, Anthony Zerbe, Simon Craig, and Martin Sheen).  Out of the supporting cast, Lom and Sheen emerge as the best ones.  Sheen is devilish wicked here as Greg Stillson, who is running for the U.S. senate.Director David Cronenberg (The Fly) serves up a genuine, old-fashioned masterpiece even though he doesn't use his trademark (weird special effects) here like in his previous films (Scanners,Videodrome).  Screenwriter Jeffery Boam conducts a well-crafted story.

And coming from David Cronenberg no less!  Anyone familiar with Mr. Cronenberg's works will be surprised at how understated this movie is, and the gore is kept to a bare and necessary minimum.  I thought many of Cronenberg's early works, while promoting interesting notions were simply too gory and in a way too emotionally and/or sexually repressed to garner serious comment.  Many of Cronenberg's later works, particularly Dead Ringers and Naked Lunch are excellent as well.  But Dead Zone is special.  Of course you have Christopher Walked who adds an 'edge' lacking in the original character portrayed in the Stephen King novel.  And then there is the supporting cast Colleen Dewhurst, Herbert Lom, etc.  Tom Skerritt, who I had never thought of as a particularly great actor, truly steals the scenes that he is in.  And of course Martin Sheen. Long before West Wing we had this wonderfully acted demagogue running for Senate with Presidential ambitions who our 'gifted' hero manages to foil.

The dilemma Smith faces is that, in stopping Stillson, he must alienate his campaign co-ordinator, Sarah Bracknell (Brooke Adams) - the only woman Smith has ever loved.In creating by far and away the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel, Cronenberg delivers and incredibly engrossing (and un-gross!) story of a tormented soul called upon to save others without ever being able to save himself.  Michael Kamen's hauntingly melancholic score perfectly graces this frequently moving film and acts as an overture to an excellent ensemble support (the underrated Lom being particularly fine as Smith's doctor). The film however belongs to the sublimely cast Walken.  His portrayal of a man tormented equally in head and heart is at times mesmerising in it's sincerity and it is to his eternal credit that what could so easily have become an interesting fantasy yarn in lesser hands is crafted here into a beautifully tragic fable.

"},{"Title":"Cronenberg's adaptation of King results in the most understated film of his career","Date":"20 August 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  There is nothing in David Cronenberg's pre-1983 filmography to suggest the remarkable understatement and restraint shown in THE DEAD ZONE. His previous works (SHIVERS, 1975, RABID, 1977, THE BROOD, 1979, SCANNERS, 1981, VIDEODROME, 1983) were marked by the unusual combination of stomach-churning gore and genuine intelligence. His films were monuments to ingenious screenplay construction and bizarre, mindblowing (sometimes literally) special effects set pieces. THE DEAD ZONE gave Cronenberg a chance to adapt someone else's work for the first time, and the change of pace serves him well. Working from a screenplay by Jeffrey Boam (based, in turn, on Stephen King's 1979 bestseller), THE DEAD ZONE is the first (as thus far only) film Cronenberg has directed without having written it himself. A young New England schoolteacher (Christopher Walken) awakens from a lengthy coma only to discover he has been blessed (or cursed) with the gift of second sight. His powers bring him into contact with an elusive serial killer, a withdrawn young child and, ultimately, a megalomaniacal grass-roots politician (Martin Sheen, in a riveting performance) bent on absolute power. Walken gives a wonderful performance as the tormented Johnny, a man who wakes up five years out of step with the world he knew. He allows Johnny to be frightened, lonely, and even selfish. The scenes where Johnny revisits his lost love Sarah (Brooke Adams) are heartbreaking. Cronenberg skillfully builds suspense, and the film has almost none of his trademark gore (one suicide scene excepted). He concentrates on atmosphere and characterization instead, bringing the wintery New England landscape and small town ethos of King's novel vividly to life. Cinematographer Mark Irwin captures King's New England better, perhaps, than anyone since, and Michael Kamen contributes a piercing, haunting original score, leagues better than his recent, non-descript work in big-budget action films. Rather than serving up a shocking, roller-coaster King blockbuster in the vein of Brian De Palma's CARRIE (1976), Cronenberg crafts an eerie, highly effective thriller light years removed from his own, more self-indulgent projects. If this is what selling out does to low-budget horror talent, then I'll take it. "},{"Title":"Great supernatural thriller.","Date":"26 July 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  If there is a thing that can be said about movies adapted from novels written by Stephen King it is that they cam in three different waves. In the beginning from the 70s to mid 80s there were well made suspenseful thrillers/horrormovies like Carrie, Shining, Cujo, Salem's Lot and this one. Then there was a long wave of utter crap, like Cat's eye, Children of the corn (less so), Sometimes they come back, Graveyard shift, the Mangler,the disappointing made for tv miniseries The Stand and so on (Misery was a diamond in this mud). And finally we have very well made movies from the late 90s until now, that however can hardly be called horror anymore. The Shawshank redemption, although a fine film, was no horror, the same goes for Dolores Claiborne and now the Green mile.The Dead Zone is a perfect example of how a Stephen King adaptation should be chilling, suspenseful, very well made and acted, and even emotional at times. This is only possible when dealing with three dimensional characters and in turn, they can only be played by actors ranging from good to wonderful. Any movie that manages to have three plots and one sub-plot and be this great is a major achievement. There's Johnny trying to keep a friend from sending his son to an ice-skating gang, because he has forseen that the ice will break and the kids will drown. Then his help is required to track down a serial killer, and finally we have Johnny trying to stop a presidency candidate from achieving his goal, because he had a vision of this megalomaniac destroying the world by starting a massive nuclear holocaust. In contrary to most Stephen King adaptations, it even has the guts to wipe the floor with Hollywood conventions and let the movie end the way it should.One of David Cronenberg's and Christopher Walken's best.

Relying only on a minimum of shocks and visual surprises, the film focuses instead on the excellent plot and the faultless performance from Walken. There is also quite a 'moral' feel relevant to the time, highlighting the gap between early 80s film-making and modern day. And the ending?

Example  In an early scene in The Dead Zone, Walken's character tells Herbert Lom's Doctor Weizak that his mother -- whom he thought had perished in the Holocaust -- is still alive.  Dr. Weizak phones her, but cannot bring himself to speak to her.  Reading that set-up, one would rightly predict a compelling, painful scene, but Cronenberg shoots it and edits it in such a way that the audience is whisked along before they get to feel anything.This practice, along with a suppression of most other things that make Cronenberg films into Cronenberg films (i.e. gore, yucky stuff, weird fetishes), makes The Dead Zone an eerily vacant piece of work; sort of like a USA Original Movie with realistic gunshot wounds and one really, really icky suicide.That aside, this is a great film for actors and for one unjustly overlooked D.P. named Mark Irwin.Actors include the always reliable Christopher Walken, who first captured my attention as the psychotic Drill Instructor in Neil Simon's less-than-stellar Biloxi Blues.  He's made a career out of many great, mostly thankless, performances, in such films as The Deer Hunter (his Oscar, and to date his last stop at any awards shows), Batman Returns, Pulp Fiction, and True Romance.  Here he's given leading man status, which he handles with grace and aplomb.Also there's Brooke Adams, who's sort of like a down-to-earth version of Karen Allen.  Martin Sheen gives one of his very best performances as Senator-to-be Gregg Stillman, and Tom Skerrit is also quite good as Sheriff Bannerman.The Dead Zone was photographed by Mark Irwin, a frequent collaborator with early Cronenberg films, such as The Fly, Scanners, and Videodrome.  Lately he's shot all three of the Farrely brothers' comedies, as well as recent films by the kindler, gentler Wes Craven (New Nightmare, Scream). With The Dead Zone as well in those later works, he adds a crisp, polished visual sense that makes the bad films he works on seem O.K., and the good ones better.

But in The Dead Zone, everything that makes King great came to fruition, in spades. It was quite simply a perfect movie, starting out rather blandly, then morphing into a roller coaster ride that doesn't let up until the very last frame. I have always told my actor friends that this was Christopher Walken's single greatest dramatic role of his entire career, and was recently glad to see that Mr. King himself had said the same thing. But any role, not matter how well performed, needs an equally great cast to support it, and on this point, again, King got it right, pulling together a stellar cast that would be the envy of any production, featuring some of the best actors in the business, starting with the often under appreciated Brooke Adams as his long suffering fiancée, in another brilliantly understated performance. Same for the subtle but always great Tom Skerrit, one of our best American actors, always going for the quiet truth in the scene, never grandstanding. Then the marvelous character actor Herbert Lom as the world wise psychiatrist, bringing a level of pathos and heft to the film that was the perfect counter to the lost and confused Johnny Smith (Chris Walken). Finally, Martin Sheen in an unusual star turn as the psychotic senator, a total departure for his usual roles of all-American purity. He brought a level of chilling coldness and evil to the role that was to be admired. But any great film requires an equally great director, and the master of blood splatter, David Cronenberg, really stepped up to the challenge, bringing a level of human emotion and values that was to be admired. He turned what could easily have been just another tale of the supernatural into a true world of art, a movie with dare I say, heart. It was deeply moving on so many levels. ADDENDUM Just recently, I watched a documentary featuring Stephen King doing a retrospective on his own movies and his personal favorite classic horror films. I wasn't surprised to learn that he, too, felt that The Dead Zone was his best picture. An actor myself, years later I had the distinct pleasure of working with the superb stage actor Colleen Dewhurst, who played Walken's mother in the film, and remarked how much I enjoyed her performance. She was quite a broad, a real grande dame of the theater. When I mentioned her role, she told me Of all the big roles I've done in my life, the only time my son told me how much he liked me is when I get shot by the sheriff in the movie, and die a grisly death.

When the media whiffs a story out of it after he warns a minor accident and help catch a serial killer, he is shown as a freak after which he mostly keeps to himself. But when he sees the disturbing future of a crooked bully of a candidate running for Senator (Martin Sheen), Johnny decides to alter the future .Walken's performance is highly inconsistent. Thats not exactly right, his performance is actually very consistent and same despite the scenario where it feels like he is extremely suited and good at times, out-of-place and mediocre otherwise. Haven't seen a lot of Brook Adam's work, but she comes off as a subtle actress with a confident and mature voice. Action sequences, at times editing felt quite amateurish and there are many rogue threads in the screenplay which does not contribute to the central plot. Cinematography is excellent especially in capturing the quite and scenic backdrop, background score heavily relies on a single note but very pleasant. Since this is an adaptation, I cannot comment much on the way the story has been dealt (I found it a bit too flat), but a few fixes to the screenplay could have added a lot of value.Just about manages to get past a B-movie feel, inconsistent screenplay and unambitious script might have played a part.

He awakens five years later to discover his former fiancée Sarah (Brooke Adams) married with children and his life in quiet ruins. Partly crippled due to muscle atrophy John suddenly enters into a new reality - for him just a day earlier he was happily committed and essentially satisfied with his life. Now however everything lies in tatters, not helped by the revelation that the accident has afforded him the special gift - or curse - of paranormal vision...One of Cronenberg's mildest movies it is also his least adventurous. Despite being gifted by a strong Stephen King novel and a distinguished lead in Walken, the overall feel is B-rate horror fare, where lowered expectations may offer heightened appraisal. Several fetishes of Cronenberg do appear (albeit none in the form of body horror), such as an obsession with death as a moment bound to the future or human detachment. The movie does embark on the journey very lazily with predictable dialogue and sub-par chemistry between Adams and Walken (who otherwise is glorious in this movie), throwing in a lame self-fulfilling line just before the accident (something in the mold of Watch how your driving). The story delivery coupled with unusual camera angles and a relatively engaging and unpredictable story holds up well. That said several scenes carry a camp quality to it (most notably Martin Sheen's president sequence), which lowers the bar significantly.Several more contemplative issues do feature, less hidden in the story than in normal Cronenberg pieces. One of them throws in the age-old time-travel question about the morality of killing Hitler before the Nazi reign, but these concepts are pretty shallowly dealt with to forward the story. The biggest commentary itself however deals with Smith's decision to detach himself from the outside world, hiding in grief of the life that was and never was, as well as taking his gift away from humanity, deciding to focus on his downfall, not on the possibilities it offers.

First off, Walken is involved in a horrible accident and is comatosed for five years. As he awakens he finds his life has slipped through his fingers, his job and love are gone and he'll have to adjust to a completely new life with one major difference; his psychic powers, mostly dormant before the accident, have reached full force and he can see past and future events.Then we're into serial killer territory ala Stephen King (in Castle Rock, no less). A vicious killer roams the streets and the local sheriff manages to convince Walken to use his powers to locate the fiend.After successfully helping out with the Castle Rock killer, Walken leads a reclusive life, keeping contact with people at a minimum. However, soon he's faced with a huge responsibility when he learns of a future disaster and he has to make a tough choice; Should he intervene or let things happen naturally.Cronenberg makes some big changes from the book and they're all good. Added weight is given to Walken's solitary existence and, if anything, the supernatural aspect is reduced. Less is made of The Castle Rock Killer and the final third gets more attention. All of this is good, making The Dead Zone an extremely appealing drama and suspense film. Walken's relationship with Brooke Adams is thoroughly involving and moving and the final minutes are extremely suspenseful.Performances are first rate as well. Walken is just perfect as Johnny Smith, a surely damned individual with the weight of the world on his shoulders (literally). Never before or after has Walken been this likable and moving. Brooke Adams, Herbert Lom, Martin Sheen and Anthony Zerbe provide solid support.As for Cronenberg, The Dead Zone is easily his most accessible film. His earlier efforts, while very interesting, are either acquired tastes or demand at least two viewings to fully appreciate. Here, everything is kept relatively low-key and the film is all the more powerful for that.Highly recommended.

His one time love of his life is now married with a child and as Johnny tries to come to terms with that and also his new found ability, he's hurtling towards confrontations with monsters that literally could have consequences for mankind.Director David Cronenberg's first dip into in the waters of mainstream cinema, gone is the weirdness and goo sodden traits, in their place comes a great adaptation of a wonderful novel, and a triple pronged sword culminating in a shatteringly brilliant ending. Amazing that some Cronenberg fans missed a trick by pouring scorn on this picture during its original release, for the theme of alienation figures heavy in the piece and Cronenberg, coupled with a brilliant Christopher Walken performance (as Smith), has crafted a most excellent piece of dramatic cinema.It would be outrageous, and wrong, of me to over tell of the monsters and inner turmoil that Johnny Smith confronts, suffice to say here is a picture that if you haven't seen before then you really need to stay clear of any potential spoilers. The plot summary is in place for all to read, you just need to sit back and enjoy the serial killer strand in the piece, and in this day and age of political monsters, get involved with the excellently Stephen King written political finale that impacts royally the more the years roll by. Backing up the wonderful Walken is the under praised Brooke Adams (as love interest Sarah), Herbert Lom, Tom Skerritt, Anthony Zerbe and a very memorable weasel turn from Martin Sheen, all of whom excel at being given meat to chew on from Cronenberg.Great story, great cast and very astute direction, so what you waiting for?

The way of storytelling really means that the movie shouldn't work but yet it does.Never have been too fond of Stephen King adaptations. His horror stories are always too formulaic to bring them to the screen and deliver a fine and original genre movie, although there are the obvious exceptions, this being one of them. Still the movie heavily suffers from the book elements. It of course is always hard to turn a 500 pages book into a feature length movie is always hard. You have to drop a lot of elements and story lines but still keep the spirit and essence of the story. The story keeps switching plot lines in basically every 15 minutes. It's ridicules! It shouldn't work! But yet it does work out fine, with as a result an original fresh thriller/horror movie.This is an early movie from director David Cronenberg, that differs quite a lot from his normal style. I think he wanted to stay true to the novel and tone thing down a little. Nothing is forced and it has a realistic approach. So just don't expect any 'scare' moments or things like that but simply expect a well constructed and made movie, without any big production values. Just like the story, the movie is kept overall simple and close to home. It provides the movie with a good atmosphere and it are the actors of the movie that really take the movie to another level.Christopher Walken is a great leading man and its fun to see that his style of acting has very little changed over the years. The movie further more features Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Anthony Zerbe and Martin Sheen in some good and smaller roles.The movie features many different events and linear told plot lines, such as the first one focusing on Johnny Smith's own struggles after his accident, the one that concentrates on the serial killer, the one with the Stuart boy and the final one with congress candidate Greg Stillson. As the movie progresses things start to develop well and take more and more form and it becomes obvious were the story is heading to. This isn't clear yet from the beginning on. It makes the ending work out all the more well and fitting.One of the better King adaptations and also one of the more accessible David Cronenberg movies.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"An incredible piece of film making, one that simply must be seen.","Date":"24 September 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" This is by far David Cronenberg's best film, and a truly great piece of film-making.

Christopher Walken is one of the finest actors alive, and he is at the top of his game in The Dead Zone. His Johnny Smith is so real, and vulnerable, that the viewer almost wishes he could reach out and comfort him as his life's tragedies escalate.This film can also be looked at as a strange sort of superhero story. Johnny is the victim of a terrible accident which bestows great power upon him, and even though he is suffering, he finally chooses to put himself in great danger to save the world.All in all, this is a movie I would recommend to everyone.

There's something about the notion of the reluctant hero, an everyman caught into a situation that he wants to get out of, as forces of the unnatural come out in spurts. But unlike the dual-nature of the lead in the other film, in the Dead Zone Johnny (Christopher Walken) isn't necessarily living down his 'curse' for the whole story. His is one that gets the viewer involved not just because of the strength of the character that Cronenberg is able to convey, but through his choice of an actor. One might think at first Walken has a presence already established as a character actor of villain roles (then again his list of credits makes the mind reel), but there's a characteristic that he conveys through Johnny that works so well it's a contender for one of his best and coolest even (if not as talked about as the Deer Hunter or the King of New York).The story is fashioned in a somewhat given style of King's, in that it starts out with a real, solidly founded and actually compelling dramatic situation and then turn the screws with a darker, supernatural. Johnny Smith, a schoolteacher, gets in a coma after a traffic accident, changing his personal life first (no more in-love girlfriend), and something else- psychic abilities by touch. In the course of the film, which at times is perhaps more episodic than straightforward (no pun intended with Johnny's condition), he reluctantly assists a murder investigation, sees the future of a lonely boy he's tutoring, and then has the darkest premonition when in contact with a shady senator (Martin Sheen), leading him to an unexpected fate. This story is told with some melodrama at times, some that works and some that is maybe a little weaker than with Cronenberg's other work. However, the liabilities in some of the scenes is forgivable given the perks.And the perks of the film amount to something that's, in a way, more of a drama with some moments of terror, violence and dark-as-an-alley sense of humor more associated with the director than with the original novelist's over-the-top descriptions and macabre. Still, I think that King fans shouldn't see this added, subliminal style of the filmmaker as something to turn away from, as it has enough going for it to overlook some of the minor flubs. After all, you have Walken in a performance that few others could do, with his little moments of enraged outbursts quite entertaining (i.e. the ice is gonna break!). And Sheen is in quite the career-choice performance, playing completely against his real self (or rather the type associated with the West Wing) as a megalomaniac politician. In short, it's an efficient, engaging movie delivering just enough for the supernatural crowd as well as those looking for a drama with believable, sympathetic characters (some of them anyway).

Even though the movie is billed as a thriller, it is more than that. Christopher Walken plays a school teacher that has a serious car accident and after waking from a coma after 5 years discovers that he has psychic powers. He can see the future as well as the past. The movie has the set up of a thriller, he is asked by the goal sheriff to assist in a murder investigation, he has visions that save lives. The movie focuses more on the effect that this has on Walken's character. Being Walken, he brings a creepiness to the role, but also a sadness and a 4realism that makes one care for him. His character is a victim of his gift, he tries to isolate himself from the world to avoid the pain of his visions. When he meets a politician eerily played by Martin Sheen, he has a vision that brings him to realize that he must act to change the future. All of this is done with skill by David Cronenberg, a solid director that showed he could make an effective thriller without much gore.

Besides that Johnny soon discovers that he has awoke with heightened psychic ability after correctly predicting a nurse's house would set on fire & endanger her young daughter who as a result of his premonition is saved. However the gift of second sight quickly becomes a curse which ruins Johnny's life & turns him into a circus act to the point he has to hide away in his house all day. With both emotional & moral turmoil eating away at Johnny he has to make some tough decisions...Directed by David Cronenberg & based on the novel by Stephen King this is not as horror orientated as those two high profile well known genre names would lead you to believe, sure it has aspects of horror but it's as much a drama & thriller which ask's questions as anything else. The script is as much a character study of Johnny & the effect his new found psychic abilities has on him both emotionally & physically & the way it completely changes his life, the way it changes how those around him view him & how he deals with it. In that sense The Dead Zone is successful as Johnny is a well written & fleshed out character who I became interested in as a person & wanted to see where his story went. The film certainly engages & it's fairly absorbing as well & the time passed quickly while I was watching it. However, the film does feel a bit fragmented, it goes from a murder case to Johnny helping a young boy to Johnny wrestling with his conscience in order to decide whether assassination for a greater cause is the right thing to do in a series of subplots that come & go a little too quickly. Some modern day audiences might be put off by the dialogue heavy script & the slightly sedate pacing which often forgoes action & gore for exposition, character study & drama.There's some intense psychic visions suffered by Johnny as seen in flashbacks which are well staged. The film looks good but is maybe a little forgettable & doesn't have much in the way of Cronenberg's style or visceral visuals. There's a bit of gore, a few gunshot wounds are seen & a guy with a pair of scissors stuck in his mouth is also shown. There are one or two unsettling moments as expected but the scares are generally absent in favour of solid drama.Apparently this had a budget of about $10,000,000 which sounds like a lot of money especially when you consider it was made in the early eighties, it's certainly well made with an eye for detail but I didn't think it was anything spectacular. Filmed in Ontario in Canada. There's a great cast here including the always reliable Christopher Walken, Tom Skerritt, Brooke Adams, Herbert Lom, Anthony Zerbe & Martin Sheen who put in fine performances to add even more dramatic weight to an already dramatic story.The Dead Zone is a solid supernatural drama thriller that I enjoyed but the slightly slow pace means I probably wouldn't want to see it again & to be honest I prefer films with a bit more incident. Followed by the TV series The Dead Zone (2002 - 2007) which ran for eighty episodes over six seasons & an edited film compilation of the first two episodes was released as The Dead Zone (2002) on video/DVD.

Another plot-line.. oh no, that was just to explain a little bit more about his psychic powers, and by the time everything really starts after being led into dead-end alleys a few times, the film is almost finished. I understand that the several unrelated plot-lines which lead to nowhere is just to show how he lives with this curse/ability, but it doesn't add any value to the film, is incoherent and absolutely completely kills any momentum.

Cronenberg seems to be the best director to handle this sort of premise, but the result is rather lame and restricted. There's none of that grotesque power that he is known for - the early effects involving Johnny being literally transported into a burning house and that open-jawed bloody corpse of the murderer policeman have a little promise, but even that is censored, and we don't actually see the act itself. Gunshot wounds materialise with an obvious unmistakable bloodiness on bodies like some B-movie, sex becomes unbuttoning the top two buttons and dry hugging, and Psycho-inspired sound effects pipe up whenever he has one of his horrifying visions. It's all very unconvincing. There's so many moments that seem to threaten the horror and seriousness of this movie, but it seems the script is unaware of this. The romance sideplot starts off corny as you like with the girl running back and a kiss in the rain. After 5 years, where it seems logical that this sort of love would subside, it pricks up again, and for a moment her husband is non-existent. And in the final moment, she weeps unashamedly and they reconcile again...even though from any rational perspective it just seems like he's tried to assassinate a politician. This ending could very well be a comedy skit, but the soundtrack and Walken's morbid whispers of the future seem determined to make it dark and grim and tragic. Martin Sheen's presidential candidate is the most hammy and over-the-top character of them all, saying Hallelujah and celebrating a nuclear holocaust, and the way he holds up a child as a shield...but I'm sure the intention is not to make the viewer burst out laughing. The dialogue at times betrays itself and makes it very clear that this is a Stephen King adaptation. God forbid Sarah move on with her life she is referred to as someone who has turned her back upon Johnny and 'cleaves' onto another man like some hell spawn. The officer's mother refers to Johnny's abilities as though he has struck a deal with the devil from hell itself. The creaky house is bathed in green light as if to enhance its supernatural atmosphere. There's a little junior rainman character that speaks cryptically and much more advanced than his age suggests...this mystery of course goes nowhere. They recite Edgar Allen Poe as if this is something they just do everyday for fun. This might have worked if the world created wasn't so fake and facile with all its super serious yet hilarious horror visions...unfortunately there's nothing fresh or tense about this movie at all.

There are exceptions, of course, namely genre classics Carrie (1976) and The Shining (1980). The great directors Brian De Palma and Stanley Kubrick managed to turn King's often plodding narrative into a gripping visual spectacle. Canadian auteur David Cronenberg does something similar with The Dead Zone, and although it lacks the greatness of the aforementioned masterpieces, it is a wonderfully made and solidly-acted film.It follows Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken), a happy schoolteacher who is madly in love with girlfriend Sarah (Brooke Adams). After suffering a headache on a roller-coaster, he declines Sarah's invitation to stay the night and drives home. On his way, he has a car accident which leaves him in a coma. When he wakes up, he discovers he's lost 5 years of his life and Sarah is now married with a child. After touching a nurse's hand, he sees her daughter trapped in a burning house and warns her. It turns out the coma has left Johnny with the ability to see people's past, present and future, and also the power to change the future with foresight. News of his new gift spreads, and his abilities are called upon by local sheriff Bannerman (Tom Skerritt), who asks Johnny to assist in solving a series of murders.That is only half of the plot. Characters seem to come and go and eventually the film switches focus to corrupt Senatorial candidate Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen). Cronenberg and screenwriter Jeffrey Boam do their best to streamline King's sprawling plot, but without a focused narrative, the film can sometimes be as sketchy as King's novel. But Walken is great, helping create a character to really care about, and the supporting actors just as good. Rather than offer lazy jump- shocks, Cronenberg is patient and careful to drum up an atmosphere which makes the supernatural themes feel oddly naturalistic. It's far from the Canadian's best, but The Dead Zone is finely made and greatly entertaining.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Good adaptation, not so good screenplay and acts","Date":"15 September 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" This is one of the better Cronenberg movies and although I won't give it an award, I really liked it. The original novel is one of the best King books so no wonder the movies based on such book should follow closely specially since there is no science fiction and cheesy special effects to distant audience from the original book experience. Fact is, writing a book is different than writing screenplay. Screenplay writing follows some strict rules and to maintain the entertainment factor of the movie, it should be restricted to an acceptable cliché no wonder why so many adaptation do not closely follow the original books. I would say a movie adaptation should be a more entertaining version of the original script. In terms of cliché, screenplay almost followed the rules for the first 30 minutes but after that, movie enters into an static and rather boring state which lasts for almost 40 minutes. At 25% mark, the hero does not start to follow his outer motivation, he is totally lost and at that point, an audience who had no prior exposure to the story does not know what he should expect out of the movie. Good thing is that the script is full of conflicts, enough to elicit emotions in audience to follow the movie despite the lost state. Hero starts a minor goal in the 45% mark and that's when he decides to help sheriff to find the murderer although this goal resolves quickly without too much conflict. The real movie starts at 60% mark when he is hired to tutor a rich kid and through that phase, he meets the senator for the first time who I cautiously recognize him as the nemesis because he would not know the hero till very last moments of the movie but still he is the closest thing to a nemesis in the story. Also through that rich kid, he learns about his ability to predict and change future events which leads to his final goal... assassination of the would be devil leader. In terms of character arch, it really starts moving at this point so the whole minor goal of catching the murderer has nothing to do with the final resolve of the movie and also do not contribute much to the character arch. It was good for the novel but to adapt the story for big screen, I would just ditch that part and try to extend the main phase more, probably give it some more conflict, work more on character development and etc. Probably because of the murder resolving phase and attempts to trim the movie in 100 minutes time frame, screenplay fails to do enough character development for the main phase. Would be senator (played by Matrin Sheen) is an example of crude character development. The whole thing about Greg Stillson (would be senator) feels artificial and awful play by Martin sheen makes it much worse. Specially the scenes that he forces president to launch a nuke or something like that as the speaker of the house (that is a guess because he calls someone else vice president) is extremely cheesy and baseless. When I say they had to ditch the murder phase out of the movie was to have more time to develop such scenes more elaborately. Basically nothing surrounding Greg Stillson makes sense. How can he openly forces the president of the united states to do something, where is the security, why his bully assistant presents at that meeting and worse than that, where is security? Can a person in real life just sneaks into a meeting place of a candidate, hide on the balcony and then start shooting? Why didn't he load the gun before the meeting begins? Movie also had some production defects. The tanks in the Polish war scene appeared to be American M3 Stuart tanks with German logo so at first glance I taught it was Normandy and I told myself what all those horses are doing in western front? Overall it was nice movie and it's not fair to rate it less that 7 out of 10. Despite all the mentioned problems, screenplay was generally good and the atmosphere of the movie was awesome. This is a movie I would recommend to watch.

The man is Johnny Smith played by Christopher Walken in one of his most memorable lead performances.Indeed, the movie strikes by its simplicity, from a basic but intriguing plot device, it opens the door to a series of episodes where the only noticeable evolution is Johnny's state of health, worsening as his power gets more important. The question is less in the 'how' than the 'what', how he got the power is pointless; the key is to know what to do with it. In a certain way, the movie deals with an existentialist issue of a man who lost his girlfriend, his mother, his job, and questions his own utility to the world, the world that can be reasonably reduced to the little town of Castlerock from his modest perspective.The answer is satisfying as it doesn't insult our intelligence by trying to depict the gift in a negative way. Johnny saves a little girl from a house fire, he reveals to his doctor that his mother survived the Holocaust and in a later emotional scene, the doctor realizes its true but can't find the strength to speak to his mother. This moment helps to understand the limits of Johnny's power in its ability to provide happiness, is the relief to know that someone we learned to mourn is actually alive worth the awareness of a wasted time? The story intelligently deviates to highlight the practical usefulness of Johnny's gift as it helps to put an end to a series of atrocious crimes during an investigation lead by the Sheriff Tom Skerrit's. The resolution leads to a particularly gruesome scene reminding us of the horrific aspect of the film.The killer's suicide scene indeed invites to consider the significance of horror in The Dead Zone. The movie doesn't feature many bloody scenes, it surely is more a fantasy thriller than a horror film, but gore and violence are not the only basis of horror. Strangely, the doom of Johnny is to foresee not the present, past or future, but the horrific events wounding one's heart or about to destroy a life. Johnny's mind is like a Pandora box carrying the whole torment and catastrophes that can destroy a person as a metonymy for human lives. He relives human tragedies, World War II, murders, natural disasters; Johnny witnesses with his eyes the darkest side of humanity.And the worsening of Johnny's state indicates that the weight of these sufferings and this pain is getting heavier and more unbearable on his shoulders. Somewhat, he's condemned to death, but something is still missing. He helps people because it's his true altruistic nature but his reputation as the local freak is getting more and more on his nerves and somewhere the question is still asked what can he do with his power? This is where the antagonistic presence of Greg Stillson, plays its role. Martin Sheen, in a scene stealing performance plays the role of a demagogic politician hose devouring ambition inspires both people's respect and fear. He's the kind of born-to-win leader and extremely talented tactician who'll never allow anything or anyone to block his road for destiny, for the White House.Johnny will foresee the devastating effects of Stillson's ascension to the power and how it would lead to a nuclear holocaust. Asking a strange question to his doctor, Johnny wonders if he would have assassinated Hitler if he had the opportunity. This question reveals two important points the meaning of Johnny's power, and of his unique condition. He's got the power to change the future for the best, and he was meant to stop the ascension of Greg Stillson, to spare the world from his cruel actions. Johnny Smith is a Christ-like figure, and will sacrifice himself by saving lives of millions of people.Stephen King has a strange fascination for these persons whose actions benefit to humanity, exceeding the limits of their modest condition, John Coffey is one of them. The kind of ordinary setting of Castlerock that we'll find again in Stand By Me reinforces the ordinary aspect of these heroes, everyday men in quest for a meaning to their lives. And of course, there is a supernatural power handled with a tactful intelligence, no special effects, no over-dramatization, the gift is not the end but the mean of its hero to save people's lives, and speaking of hero, Johnny Smith is an extremely likable character, inspiring our most profound sympathy, a man whose physical torment is due to his power to save people, Stephen King's mind provided not just memorable villains, but extraordinary and universally appealing heroes.And the movie invites us to think about these men who accessed to the power by cheating, lying, and providing a positive image to people, with an indecent capability to cover their hideous, heinous or cowardly natures. Life is a hazardous lottery where the most deserving don't necessarily win, innocents die and evil people succeed, and as a reminder of the infamous butterfly effect, The Dead Zone proves that many tragedies can still be avoided if we had the ability to see through the heart, what a cruel fantasy, highlighting our vulnerability.David Cronenberg's direction, and the cinematography of the film is cold and austere but contributes to create an efficient intimate feeling, to the limit of claustrophobia, as to make Johnny Smith, an even more isolated character. We don't exactly what this dead zone the film is referring to is, but probably to an inspiring, yet extremely chilling state of mind.

There are some questionable changes in the story (why the kid Johnny tutors is so young instead of a teen, losing the connection of the tiger stripes in the Stillson vision, etc.), but overall I thought it kept to the heart of the original novel. Although I must admit the Frank Dodd stuff seemed very rushed and could have probably been taken out without hurting the film.Anyway, Walken is tremendous and it's nice to see him shy and romantic instead of just going for creepy like he does these days. And you believe the love between he and Brooke Adams, because they actually look like small-town teachers and not movie stars. And I love crazy Martin Sheen. This and The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane are great (nearly) forgotten Sheen performances that his more mainstream audiences are missing out on.In summary, The Dead Zone is a quietly terrifying little film that shies away from typical Cronenberg grossouts but still says a lot about human isolation.

The Dead Zone confiscates your mind for its full runtime leading you on an enjoyable and unpredictable excursion right through the closing credits. Although the movie is by no means flawless (Brooke Adams' atrocity of a performance will have you cleaving your eyes out at times), the film is strong enough to convince you that its few shortcomings are intentional.Christopher Walken truly shines as Johnny Smith (a young schoolteacher whom awakens five years in the future from a coma after having his car annihilated by a milk truck to find he has lost his almost-wife to another man), allowing viewers one of the rare opportunities where his performance is impressive enough that we forget we're watching another Walken movie. Given the nature of Johnny Smith's situation, emotions are obviously soaring and you'll believe every second of it. As things become further complicated when Johnny begins to learn secrets about people through physical contact with them, Cronenberg makes sure to avoid going too far over the edge of believability by highlighting the very human attributes of his cast rather than taking an easier route by exploiting the very supernatural aspects of the script.Rather than using his illness for something selfish, Johnny meets up with Sheriff Bannerman (Tom Skerritt), to help with a series of unsolved murders while also finding time to tutor a socially awkward thirteen year old. We're also then introduced to the typical, up to my ears in bullshit politician, Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen); Sheen delivers a prodigious and underrated performance in his senator/future president role (perhaps foreshadowing his future on The West Wing). Johnny soon learns through a premonition that Stillson's presidency will result in a nuclear holocaust and makes it his mission to save civilization. While all this sounds like a recycled plot from a series of unaired sci-fi pilots, the film manages to find innovation through its narrative anyway. Cronenberg manages to subjoin viewers unconcerned with the story itself to the characters' fates as we grow more and more curious how this film could possibly have a happy ending. The Dead Zone is not your typical Cronenberg film nor is it your typical film in general but these are two reasons why it's worth watching. Fans of the television show might want to stay clear of this one but then again it is eminently possible there are no fans of The Dead Zone Television Series anyway.

The most famous King adaptations are Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980) and Brian De Palma's Carrie. Both great films, of course, but David Cronenberg's The Dead Zone of 1983 easily deserves equal respect. David Cronenberg is a unique and great director, and while The Dead Zone is not necessarily his most typical film, it doubtlessly ranks among his great ones. The film delivers in all aspects, with a fascinating story, an, as usual for Cronenberg, greatly menacing atmosphere, and a brilliant leading performance by Christopher Walken. A car-accident puts teacher Johnny Smith (Walken) into a coma. When he awakes he has to discover that five years have gone by, and that his fiancée has married another man. But this is not the only discovery he has to make. Ever since his awakening, Johnny has clairvoyant abilities. What seems like a gift soon turns out to be a curse, as the future he sees is a menacing one... Christopher Walken is one of my favorite actors. Hardly another unites versatility and distinctiveness as brilliantly as Walken does, and his leading performance in The Dead Zone is another proof for what a fantastic actor he is. The film's cast includes several other great actors, such as Tom Skerritt as the town Sheriff, Martin Sheen as an aspiring politician and, my personal favorite, the great Herbert Lom as Johnny's doctor. Even though not quite as bizarre as some of Cronenberg's other films (such as Scanners for example), The Dead Zone sure has crazy storyline, and this story is delivered in a typically ingenious and menacing Cronenberg atmosphere. In short The Dead Zone is a film that no lover of fascinating cinema can afford to miss! A must-see!

Now his ex-girlfriend Sarah (Brooke Adams) is married and has a child and he needs to be under the care of Dr. Weizak (Herbet Lom) to can walk again. Soon Johnny will realize that he can see the past, the present or the future of the people that makes physical contact with him.This is the main plot of The Dead Zone, based upon a novel by Stephen King, as usual. The film begins with a little introduction of how the life of Johnny was and soon after that we have the impressive car accident that leaves him in coma. I love how since the accident, the film focuses in Johnny's mind making a really interesting study of this character and not just the usual sci-fi story with a character that has an unusual ability that uses it for being good or bad. First we see how Johnny face the situation that his girl is now married and how, after he discovers his new ability, he feel the pressure of the press feeling that his ability is a curse. When he feels that he can make a good friendship with Sarah he decide to use the ability for helping other persons, in this case for finding a murderer and although they find the murderer, Johnny have the sensation that he could stop him before he committed the murders. So again he feels that the people are abusing of him and he decide to return to his work as a teacher. The last part of the film is just the best with this little kid who is the proof that Johnny can change the way of the things and also with the political factor with Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) that ends in a great way, specially the very end that is full of suspense and with a great and fair conclusion.Well, I recently re-watched Videodrome and now this film and both were released in 1983 so for me David Cronenberg was just really inspired and although both films have similar things, in the end both are quite different from each other being this film much more accessible. In fact this film is the most accessible film that I have seen in the entire career of Cronenberg.Anyway, Christopher Walken is really young here and really great just as Martin Sheen who also looks really young. Walken steals the film but the support cast is good too.Conclusion The Dead Zone is just another great film of Cronenberg. I haven't read the novel; I think I haven't read complete any book of King but I do have seen many films based in his work and definitely this is one of my favourites. 9.5 out of 10PS is funny and strange to see Walken talking about The Legend of Sleepy Hollow a couple of times in the film. Of course you know why.

Of course, he had Christopher Walken as the star. What a brilliant choice.This movie requires a soulful loser at its center. Walken more than fulfills his duty. He's a down-on-his-luck, head-damaged school teacher with second sight.

This film was his first time working in a large studio production and became the movie that opened him the gates to larger budgets and critical acclaim worldwide, as the success of The Dead Zone took him to film another of his masterpieces The Fly.The film retains the same plot of the novel, with Christopher Walken playing Johnny Smith, a teacher in a small town who plans to marry his beloved girlfriend and colleague, Sarah Bracknell (Brooke Adams). However, luck is not on his side, as one night he has a terrible accident that puts Johnny in a coma for 5 years. Now, he finds himself alone (as Sarah moved on and got married) and without a job, but with the strange curse (or blessing) of being able to predict future events. Now he'll have to learn to use that power as apparently, he can alter the future too.The Dead Zone is an interesting thriller with supernatural elements that really involves the audience thanks to its cleverly written screenplay (by Jeffrey Boam) that successfully captures the spirit of King's novel and delivers a character study of a man learning to cope with his new found power. Through several episodes, we follow Johnny in his attempts to use his new abilities for good, as well as his attempts to find a new purpose for his life now that he has lost everything. It's not a surprise why Cronenberg accepted to work in this project, as his familiar themes appear in The Dead Zone, albeit under a whole different light.Famous for his obsessions with change and disease, director David Cronenberg finds the way to explore those subjects in a psychological level in The Dead Zone, as Johnny's powers are at the same time a curse and a blessing that begins to have a change in his mind as he adapts to them. In a bold move at the time (and one that surprised many of his fans), he choose a less graphic, classier and slightly more elegant approach to this film. Despite being working as a hired-gun, Cronenberg manages to put a lot of his own in this project and along with Videodrome, it can be seen as the final steps in the development of his style, and the film that earned him critical recognition as an auteur.Christopher Walken really becomes the heart and soul of the movie, delivering one of his best performances and helping to make this supernatural story believable and thrilling. He is truly a joy to see and completely owns every scene he is in. Brooke Adams is an effective counterpart, and even when Walken is the star she manages to shine in her limited screen time. Realism seems to be the constant in the film, as this helps the movie to be closer to us despite the supernatural elements. Herbert Lom delivers a dignifying performance as Johnny's doctor, but is Martin Sheen who almost manages to steal the film as Gregg Stillson.The Dead Zone is an excellent horror/thriller and is probably among the best Stephen King's adaptations, however, I found the episodic way it was conceived a bit too similar to TV series, as if the film had been done specifically for Television (no wonder why there is a TV series based on the same book) instead of theatrical release. It's a minor complain, as I think that at times this nature is helpful, although at others the closure of an episode just breaks the mood and the atmosphere created.Despite this, The Dead Zone is a very recommended film and not only for Cronenberg or Stephen King's fans. It packs a terrific story, remarkable performances and the masterful direction of one of the most creative directors of the last times. The quiet atmosphere it evokes and the familiar mood it has make it the perfect film for a rainy evening. 8/10 "},{"Title":"A Tale Worthy of Poe and Irving, a Tale of Our Era","Date":"25 February 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Greg Stillson The missiles are flying. Hallelujah, Hallelujah! 1983 was still a pretty-good year for horror and genre fans, and a bad-one for ordinary people. Director David Cronenberg did this film back-to-back with his other political film, Videodrome, and they both compliment each other in their statements on the rightist threat to liberty in North America. The Reagan revolution's effects were being-felt by Latin Americans, the urban-poor, small farmers, minorities, women, deinstitutionalized inmates of state asylums, the working-class, and the Cold War was heating-up again with the Soviet-invasion of Afghanistan. Reagan was never truly popular, but managed to sneak into office due to voter-apathy. The rest is bunting and chest-beating by his backers. The arms race (reignited by Carter) was being accelerated by Reagan to a frightening-degree, and we were funding death-squads in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Those who noticed the insanity were watching the skies again, just as they did during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Things were pretty grim, and there was a recession. In this context, The Dead Zone did well at the box-office, and is still remembered fondly as one of the best King movies.Politician Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) is a progressive, seemingly Populist politician, but only in-appearance. In-reality, he is a ruthless criminal who uses intimidation, blackmail, and any means he can use to achieve-power. This is a very grim-portrait of North American politics, and at a time when Reaganism was sweeping-through the culture; all of it still resonates-strongly, even today. King's and Boam's allusions to Washington Irving and Edgar Allan Poe are powerful, and fitting for such a fateful and psychological tale, which gives the film a wider-sense of scope. It has something important to say about North American culture that defies any simple-explanations--I could write an entire-book on this film, and still be left with more to explain, it is that rich a tale. Above everything, however, it is a tale of loss and of what could have been. Americans know the tragedy of this all-too-well.Jeffrey Boam and David Cronenberg took Stephen King's Rip Van Winkle retelling, and made it much-much more--a parable of 1983, but also of our common era. Like most good-literature, nothing-is-as-it-seems in the Dead Zone, but entering into this is the character Johnny (played beautifully by Christopher Walken). Without any supernatural-explanations, Cronenberg gives us a character who is somehow able to penetrate the deceptions in life and what is hidden in the lives of the people he encounters (and touches). Basically, Johnny is an instrument of fate. His role is to stop a local-murderer, as well as to stop Greg Stillson from attaining power, and here, all of the authors suggest that destiny and fate limit the structure of our lives. It has been remarked (apocryphally, by Steven Spielberg, a director who fears Cronenberg's depth) that the film's storyline supports the notion of assassination--it absolutely does. For many Americans--and one can suppose, Canadians too--someone like Stillson reaching the pillars of power and authority is impossible, unthinkable. It shouldn't seem impossible after George W. Bush, a phony Populist if there ever was one. Boam, King and Cronenberg insisted in 1983 that this is quite-possible, and that only an ordinary man, poised-by-providence, can affect the course of this path-to-destruction. Will the evil end entirely? Cronenberg and Boam don't answer-this, but Stillson's and Johnny's journeys and destinies have. This is because they were intertwined. Evil never truly-ends, but neither does the resistance to it. This movie was a hire job for David Cronenberg, and yet it so-resembles the political and social-implications of all his work from his early-period, it's a strange fact. Often, the adversaries in his films are faceless, or murky, only showing-themselves at the right-moment to strike. His adversaries are often social-forces, and trends, often disembodied and invisible.The 1980s were simply an ugly and vulgar era, with a lot of submerged-politics--like Iran-Contra, where even drug-running was alleged in funding Reaganite allies in Nicauragua. Reagan said, We don't negotiate with terrorists, and did just-that! Today, it is safe-to-assume that much-worse is being done in our names, and only needs uncovering by the bravest amongst-us. Johnny shows that there is a price in this ability; he dies-a-piece with every revelation he is privy-to, he is almost like a missionary or a Civil Rights worker, or a saint. Most of the philosophical-arguments and implications are dealt-with in the dialog between Johnny and his rehabilitation counselor (Herbert Lom, in one of his greatest-performances). What would you do if you knew who the next Hitler was, and could do something about-it? Lom has the perfect answer I am a doctor...I love people...but, I would have to kill the son-of-a-bitch. The politics of the film are very clear, but so are the consequences of the sacrifice.This is why so-few people rise-to-the-occasion to fight an encroaching-evil. It is easier not to. Even nonviolence is basically a cop-out when you're facing an enemy who proves we're in a universe without morality. Johnny Smith is a messianic-figure, and a revolutionary one, and must eschew an ordinary life (this is where some of the loss figures-in). The subtext of covert political-activity is always there, waiting to be discovered, and fought, by ordinary people. And so, the horror of this film is a political horror, our political nightmare. It is the revelation that flies-in-the-face of homespun, North American values of fair-play and hard-work--that many of those who wish to govern us do not wish us well, but quite-the-opposite they wish us death, ultimately, the logical-conclusion to the will to power. This was a post-Watergate lesson we have conveniently forgotten, but are now reawakening-to, and that is the horror we face. Cronenberg made a classic that will continue-to affect caring people profoundly, it speaks-to our hopes and our fears. The Dead Zone also speaks to our regrets in this vale-of-tears.

Engaged to marry his sweetheart Sarah, Brooke Adams, he spends some time with her at her home one night and when he leaves her house to go home it starts raining very heavily. Driving in a blinding rainstorm his car crashes into a tractor trailer that jack-knifed up the road in front of him. Johnny lives but he paid a very heavy price for his survival. Being in a coma for five years when he wakes up out of it he finds that he lost his job his sweetheart to another man and his ability to walk normally but he gained something that for many would be considered a blessing but for johnny it turned out to be a curse. Johnny developed a power, due to his mind being in a five year coma, to see future or past events by getting the feelings of any person that he touches. The Dead Zone has gotten better and better with age since it was released back in 1983. Modestly made but packing a far bigger wallop then any of the movies blockbusters about psychic phenomenon which cost the Dead Zone a fraction of their hundred of million dollars budgets. Feeling that he's being exploited by people because of his strange powers Johnny becomes very introverted and does everything he can to avoid people. One night after watching the TV news about the latest victim of the Castle Rock Killer Johnny, who at first turned down Sheriff Bannerman, Tom Skerritt, to help in the case, gets in touch with the Sheriff to assist him in finding the killer. After examining a clue that was unwitting tampered by the Sheriff Johnny struck pay-dirt which led to the killers identity and resulted in his suicide. Trying to get his life back to whatever normality that he could Johnny gets jobs tutoring children who have trouble at school learning and getting along with other students because of, in most cases, their extreme shyness. One of the children that Johnny helps adjust to his teachers and classmates is Chris Stuart, Simon Craig, who's father, Anthony Zerbe, is a big political campaign contributor. One day while helping Chris with his homework Greg Stillson,Martin Sheen, drops into the Stuart house to talk with Chris' father about helping him in his campaign for getting elected to the senate. Stillon is planning to uses his election to the senate as a launch-board for his future run for President of the United States. When Stillson sticks out his hand to shake Johnny's he has a campaign button it in thus Johnny can't get Stillson's vibrations and see what he's all about.Later putting his arm around Chris Johnny gets vibrations that he'll drown when the ice breaks from under him in the hockey game that Chris is going to be playing with his school mates later that afternoon. Trying to get Chris' father to postpone the hockey game the enraged Mr. Stuart fires johnny form teaching his son. Johnny made such a deep impression on Chris about what was going to happen at the lake that he didn't go and later that afternoon the ice, like Johnny said it would, broke and two of Chris' friends fell through it and drowned. Johnny shook up with what happened to Chris' friends at the lake walked into a campaign rally for Greg Stillson and this time when Stillson put out his hand for Johnny to shake he had nothing in it. Johnny felt Stillson's vibrations and saw what the future held for him as well as everybody else on the planet if he ever got elected president. Powerful and unforgettable film about one knowing the future and if it's possible to change future events for the better.The Dead Zone is what I think is Christopher Walken's best movie with Walken's acting in that film is better then in any movie that I ever saw him in.

Exactly why or how he acquired this ability is anybody's guess. If it was explained in the book, they skipped over it here. This ability leads him into a crises of conscience when faced with the knowledge of a future event he feels he must prevent at any cost.Actually 'Dead Zone' is one of the better Stephen King horror adaptations (though 'paranormal' would probably be be a more accurate category than 'horror'), and certainly one of the best of the early ones.  Christopher Walken seems to be incapable of acting badly, and can always be relied upon to make the most of weak material- and for once Paul Verhoeven manages to make a relatively normal film without conspicuous directorial flourishes, and things oozing and decomposing and people pulling guns out of their stomach (though to be honest, I did prefer 'Videodrome', released the same year).There are some rather silly plot coincidences in this movie, and it really doesn't stand up all that well by the modern standards of something like 'Sixth Sense', but on the positive side, it stomps all over some of the other early Stephen King adaptations.

This leads to a breath-taking sudden ending which contains a good twist within the final scene that leaves you with a little smile of logic.Walken is excellent as the haunted teacher forced to cut himself off from people to protect himself from unwanted while Martin Sheen is hammy in his role as President-elect (more interesting when viewed beside his very liberal president in The West Wing). An interesting thing to note is Walken quoting the book Sleepy Hollow, interesting as he later played the headless horseman in Burton's film.A good adaptation (although I don't know how it compares to the book) but you do get the feeling that the film is just hanging around for the middle section until the Martin Sheen storyline is brought in.

The Dead Zone is not one of them. This film is lackluster and devoid of any real emotion. It's very slow paced, which I can respect in a thriller, the problem being that this movie is not suspenseful or thrilling in any way. It is the story of a man named Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) who gets into a horrible car accident. He wakes up five years later from a coma with the ability to see people's futures. He is struck with the moral debate of whether to help people with his newfound ability or to let the future be and hide away. The whole films strikes with an interesting concept, but unfortunately it is executed very poorly, and the whole idea becomes very mediocre and uninteresting.This film is very stale and static. It seems to never change tone or mood, staying at the same level of dull stagnancy. The plot seems to drag along with very little actually happening, and I found myself gradually losing interest. The characters follow the same pattern as the plot. There is little in the way of character development and I lost interest in all the characters by the end of the film. In fact, the characters don't do much to help the story along. The supporting cast is very weak, and most of the focus is on Christopher Walken's character. Walken does a decent job in his role, except that he has little to work with. His character only slightly changes throughout the film, and not for the better. He only gets less interesting and his psychic ability ends up boiling down to a neat trick that isn't really exciting anymore after the second or third time.The Dead Zone seems to be missing a spark of interest and intrigue that you would expect it to have. Everything here seems to be highly underdeveloped and it would have had a lot more potential if it had been properly executed and thoroughly fleshed out. This film is missing key elements to be a good film, and it could have been so much more. There isn't much use in watching this film.

His films are never loud or fast-paced or brisk, but they are strong and emotionally involving, no matter how fluffy the story is. Stephen King, being one of the most prolific writers of the last half-century, has often churned out sci-fi fluff written solely for entertainment. The Dead Zone is an example of this class of Stephen King fiction. A guy awakens from a coma and suddenly when he touches someone's hand, he can detect distress in the present and later the past and future, and later learns that he can alter the outcome.The charm of the writing and its projection through Cronenberg's direction is that it does not focus on one mystery for him to solve or one villain for him to catch. Walken is essentially Ichabod Crane, an unforthcoming character enclosed by the snow of New England, stricken with a blessing and a curse. It focuses on the character himself and his graceful segues in and out of a handful of vignettes wherein he eventually plays a large part in the altering of someone's life due to his personally frightening and yet hugely applicable power. The film provides prophecies of its own in imagining a WASP tyrant launching missiles with a jovial hallelujah.One of the things that can make a Cronenberg film so moving is its pulsing, lavish, sad orchestral score, usually written by Howard Shore, possibly the greatest film score composer of the 1980s and '90s. Michael Kamen substitutes him here, and Cronenberg's feeling for the story and the moods he projects upon it affect Kamen's music in the very same way as Shore's. The Dead Zone is far above the average sci-fi/horror film of the 1980s.

However, Cronenberg's film version of the novel excels where film versions of other King stories by the likes of Kubrick and a dozen other B-film directors fail - it treats the source material with a modicum of respect.Christopher Walken plays a brilliant Johnny. He has the right sort of characteristics that make him endearing when he needs to be, and downright creepy when the story requires it. Such a talent is rare in the actors of modern horror films. He also manages to act out the scenes in which Johnny is having a vision of the future in a manner that is completely convincing, rather than the pantomime that this sort of concept usually descends into. Walken's performance really lets you into Johnny's isolated world and gives you the story from his perspective, which is what makes the film so enjoyable.Other standout performances include Tom Skerrit's performance as the sherrif of Castle Rock, and Martin Sheen as the dangerously motivated man described in the blurb of the novel. Again, these characters are played with the right level of acceptance and disbelief to make the story convincing and involved. Both of the characters initially have no idea what Johnny's powers are or how they work, but both actors play out the way in which their lives are affected by said powers in a way that makes the audience accept the premise just that little bit more. The lack of any explanation of how being in a coma for five years could give Johnny the ability to see glimpses of the future also helps a lot - it shifts the focus from how Johnny got his powers to how he copes with having them.All in all, this film stands out from the pack because, like the recent adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings, it was made with faith and respect to the novel upon which it is based. If you have any doubts about the difference that this makes, then I urge you to read The Shining and Needful Things, see the film adaptations, and then do the same with The Dead Zone. At least The Dead Zone makes sense if you haven't read the book from beginning to end (at last count, I was halfway through it), unlike The Shining (which even King himself has given the thumbs down).

One senses that director David Cronenberg had no desire to make this film. No desire to tell this tale or refine this script.The plot is simple a man has an accident and wakes up from a five year coma to find that he has psychic powers. He uses these powers to solve a murder, save a boy and kill an evil politician.It's an interesting idea, but the screenplay was written by Jeffrey Boam, a talentless writer who gave us such horrible scripts as Phantom and Tales from the Crypt. The only worthwhile script that Jeffrey Boam wrote was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and even that managed to severely dumb down what was already a pretty simple series.And so The Dead Zone plays out like a really bad TV movie. None of the characters are developed beyond the superficial, the plot is predictable, the direction ugly, and the acting, with the exception of Christopher Walken, pretty cringe worthy.Luckily David Cronenberg would use the success of The Dead Zone and The Fly to launch a series of far more personal and interesting films.6/10 &#x96; Television has effectively rendered this movie obsolete. TV shows like The Medium, X-Files, The Mentalist, Ghost Whisperer and even The Dead Zone TV Series, have explored all these paranormal tales from every possible angle. As a result, Cronenberg's film now seems bland and unimaginative. The film packs no surprises, and is at times laughably ridiculous. 80's audiences may have found this interesting, but we've now seen it all before and done better. Brian De Palma's Sisters faced a similar problem, its tale of evil twins now a cliché absorbed by everything from Sesame Street to Baywatch. The reason Sisters is still watchable is because De Palma relies on visuals and camera wizardry. Cronenberg, however, is a man of intellect and is largely uninterested in aesthetics. The result is a badly shot film which is unfortunately also very stupid.

Now, I really don't think it being an 80's film has anything to do with my disappointment with it, the terrible acting on the other hand might. Seriously, I don't know how they managed to pull this off with so many bad actors in one film, nearly everyone's performance was terrible, excluding Walken himself who is the reason I didn't give this film a lower rating than 5. Brooke Adams as Sarah Bracknell performance literally made me cringe each time I heard her voice or saw her facial expressions, her ridiculous attempts at being emotional or even passing as a normal human being (rather than say, a psychopath who's trying to fake emotion) were just so out of place I ended up feeling bad for Johnny Smith almost immediately. And it's not just Adams, the way the old doctor calmly accepted the discovery of Johnny's ability as if he found a new soda brand rather than a mind blowing super human power, the way Mrs Dodd died when being shot or Johnny's mother having a stroke and later dying was the kind of performance you'd expect from community theater at best, and it was standing in contrast to Walken's own performance which was in my opinion pretty decent. Martin Sheen as Greg Stillson was too over the top and didn't seem like a believable character at all. Acting aside, everything else was perhaps what people would say you should expect from an 80's film - slow pace and underwhelming direction, I disagree. The way I see it, this film's creators were relying mostly on the plot of the book to fulfill the part of being interesting, that they felt they can skip on effort, direction creativity or good acting, and that's a shame, because this film could've been so much more.

And he discovers that he can grasp someone's hand and sometimes intuit something about the other person's life -- past and future. When this paranormal ability gets around, he's deluged with blandishments from the ambitious and forelorned.Walken is swept up into a local serial murderer case. These serial murderers are all over the place, even small towns in Maine. If we didn't have them we'd have to invent them. We HAVE invented more than actually exist. Where was I? Please don't interrupt again.Anyway, it's all driving Walken nuts and he moves to another tiny town where he sets up shop as a tutor and tries to live a life of quiet desperation, quiet being the operative term, in the middle of an election involving an ambitious, bloviating candidate played by Martin Sheen.But it's no use. Two canvassers for Sheen visit his house. They are Brooke Adams and her husband, with their little child. When they leave, Walken weeps against the wall and frightens his student.Somehow Walken winds up at a gathering of Sheen supporters and manages to shake hands with the candidate. VOOM! Another vision. Walken sees Sheen as president of the United States, thoroughly demented, initiating World War III without reason. Enough is enough. Walken's life is in ruins anyway and he decides to assassinate Sheen.As usual in Stephen King story, there is a satisfactory ending although it involves the loss of the central character's life.The plot seems patched together of two stories, with the psychic abilities forming the expected background. Story One Psychic solves serial murder mystery. Story Two Psychic saves United States from a political madman. There's a palpable rift between the two plots, which don't hold together all that well.Not that it matters. King's stories don't depend much on inexorable logic or impeccable structure. They depend on moment-to-moment suspense and thrills, and some exploration of character, and David Cronenberg makes sure all the ingredients are there.Christopher Walken provides what glue there is in the narrative. He's an exceptional actor. I can think of only one movie in which he was unable to live up to the demands of the screenplay -- and the screenplay was so bad that it wasn't worth living up to. I can't remember the name of it. It involved Walken flapping around in a robe and sucking on a huge cigar. In Dead Zone, Walken's is the only character that changes. The others, even the important ones, are pretty static.This script isn't poorly written, as we move from scene to scene. Each scene is entire unto itself. But the scenes themselves don't always match each other very well.The budget seems to have been limited too, though there's not much to be done about that. The climactic speech by the man who will become president is held in some kind of school classroom. It doesn't carry the ominous poetry of, say, The Parallax View. Still, it's diverting enough and in no way insulting. Worth a watch if you don't feel like being challenged.

But a Walken fan as I am, I kept watching, but nothing turned to the better, it just turned to the worse. Not even Walken, best among actors, could make this movie bearable.

There is nothing to look forward to in this film, no mystery, suspense, drama, romance, action, or anything else. I was very disappointed with this film since most King adaptations from novels to films are great to watch. This one, however, was a shocker. I genuinely could not wait for the credits to come up and to go to bed. I'm also at a loss as to why this film has an R rating when there is virtually no violence, sex or swearing. As for extras on the DVD? Well, my version doesn't have any but even if it did, it would not increase the enjoyment of the film for me one iota. I cannot stress it enough keep clear, keep clear, keep clear..... "}]
