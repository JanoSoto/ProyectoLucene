Americans yawned or laughed this off the screen, for the most part, but if you dig Godzilla you should dig this, his most respectable film since the 1954 original.Yes, it's not that fast paced. No, Godzilla doesn't fight with other creatures. So what? After about twenty lurid, cheap movies that involved Godzilla in mortal combat with rubberized foes, it was nice to see him get back to menacing basics here. While the special effects are not quite up to the Hollywood standard, they're still entertaining and reasonably convincing. American critics who slammed the film's look were being just a tad intolerant - all foreign films tend to be cheaper than ours, so inferior effects are a given. My bottom line for judging SFX is not, are they realistic? but are they fun?, and the shots of Godzilla laying waste to Tokyo are indeed fun.Godzilla fans often complain about the film's overtly political concerns and somber mood, but I have to disagree with them; I like a bit of realism, a bit of credibility. I do think that there are several better, faster-paced Godzilla films (Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, GMK), but this is still a standout entry in the series. Who knows when we'll get another solo vehicle for the big G? The upcoming Godzilla Final Wars will apparently feature a total of ten monsters. At least in this movie, Godzilla had the spotlight all to himself.

The Tokyo natives think up all sorts of goofy plans to get rid of Godzilla, one which involves a highly advanced flying tank called Super-X, the other involving the use of birds to activate an often unused portion of Godzilla's brain that resembles a bird's to lead him out of Tokyo and into a volcano, where he remains until the sequel, Godzilla VS Biollante.The 1985 American version includes scenes of us damned Americans trying to figure out what do and features Raymond Burr reprising his Steve Martin character from the American version of the first film. However, his first name is never used on account of comedian Steve Martin's then hot popularity. This version also gives Russians a bad name because they made the Russian commander launch the missile before he died when in the original version he died heroically trying to stop the missile's launching but failed. The death of the tramp is also shown in the original version.Maybe it's the lighting or lack there of, the smoke, or just the dated quality of my VHS tape, but this is a very dark and atmospheric monster on the rampage epic and one that I hold very close to my heart for reasons I can't quite explain. Special effects run the usual gamut from good to ridiculous, and the music is pretty good. Whether or not the original version will ever be released in America remains to be seen.

It looks the least like any 'real' reptile and more like a maddened, nuke-scorched monster. Or maybe just a big, green charcoal briquette with eyes. Anyway, it's feral and mindless, which is what Godzilla originally was. None of this superhero-friend-to-children-single-dad B.S. He's indestructible, he's angry, and he's going to destroy things. Why? Because.I agree with the criticism of the FX. Even though we don't expect miracles from a Godzilla movie, this one had some rough spots that typically didn't appear in even the cheapest of the series' offerings. One scene in particular comes to mind when Godzilla does a firesweep of the military equipment firing on him as he comes out of Tokyo bay, the angle of the animated firebreath doesn't match the aim of the monster's head.I also agree that there isn't enough city-smashing. Some people prefer monster vs. monster battles, some prefer monster vs. military, I'm one of the group that likes to see major metropolitan areas levelled. Frankly, this movie didn't fully satisfy ANY of the three groups, as far as I can tell.All that said, this is my second-favorite Godzilla film, after the original King of the Monsters and before Godzilla vs. King Kong.

When I was a little kid, I was a dinosaur fanatic. My mom used to rent a dinosaur cartoon movie (made by some unknown studio) and I would watch it all the time. However, when that movie was unavailable for rental, my mom introduced Gojira to me. The film was titled Godzilla 1985 and understandably, as I didn't understand subtitles back then, it was the US version of the Japanese 1984 film (the one with Raymond Burr in it). Though I heard the original Japanese version contains numerous scenes that were cut from the US version, the US version is still pleasant to watch. I would never have thought that this movie would lead me into years of collecting Godzilla and other Toho sci-fi movies, and even soundtrack CDs. The video version of this movie I rented included the short Bambi Meets Godzilla cartoon. Poor Bambi!I think Shuichi Nagahara wrote a nice screenplay, depicting suspense, humor, power, and politics. Koji Hashimoto did a good job directing(keeping the plot intact), and Teruyoshi Nakano did great on the special effects (probably his best work). Reijiro Koroku provided a terrific music score, creating what I think is one of the best non-Ifukube scores.Even though this movie features Godzilla only, it remains one of my all-time favorites. The scenes of Godzilla rising out of Tokyo bay, rendering the military helpless, and causing a path of destruction in Tokyo as citizens run for their lives are powerful. The scene where Godzilla derails a train with people still in it is still appalling for me to watch. I used to fast-forward the sea louse scene, for it scared the heck out of me. Now, the scene it pretty tamed to watch. The part where Godzilla falls inside the volcano was sad to watch, and aroused my sympathy in the monster. When the character Professor Hayashida said that when mankind falls into conflict with nature, monsters are born, I think it is a really moral message (thinking back that it was nuclear bombs that brought Godzilla's wrath). And, the part where Burr said at the climax of the film that hints Godzilla is a natural force better explains Godzilla's purpose.Overall, a great way to revive the Godzilla series after a 9-year hiatus, and a great introduction to the Godzilla Heisei series, which ran from 1984-1995.

Instead of making a sequel to 1975s Terror of MechaGodzilla, he decided to reboot the series. This film takes place directly after the 1954 Gojira taking place 30 years later, ultimately ignoring the sequels from the 50s to the 70s. In Japan, the movie was called Godzilla, in the US it's known as Godzilla 1985, but I like to call it by its international title, The Return of Godzilla.The story may be simple, but it works. It's essentially the plot of the first movie with some differences. For one thing, this is the second Godzilla creature to attack Japan. Another thing is the addition of the new flying weapon, the Super X used to stop Godzilla and ultimately failed. The major difference is the setting, the first movie was in 1954, this one is in 1984, a whole 30 years since he original attack.The acting is really well done, and the effects look spectacular. My only minor nitpick has to be the animatronic close ups of Godzillas face. It's a unique idea, but it suffers from the fact that the head doesn't resemble the suits head.Speaking of the suit, I love what they did with is suit, it resemble the 1954 Godzilla minus the ears and tiny pupils that made him look more like an animal.I can safely say it's one of the best Godzilla films I've seen in a while. It really is worth watching. Only problem, like most American fans, it's very hard to see this film mostly because it never got a US DVD release, it was released theatrically in the US and was released on VHS in the US, but never got a DVD release. Thankfully I own a bootleg of the movie which also comes with the US release, Godzilla 1985.Now my quick thoughts on the US release, it's the same as the original release in Japan, but with a lot of differences. One major difference is the inclusion of Raymond Burr, returning as Steve Martin from the US release of Gojira (Known as Godzilla King of the Monsters). There were also minor scenes cut from the film I.E. Goro calling his editor from an island, and Hayashada and Naoko making a wave generator. The most controversial change was the scene where the Russian submarine officer Colonel Kashirin valiantly attempts to stop the launch of a nuclear weapon. New World edited the scene (and added a brief shot of Kashirin pressing the launch button) so that Kashirin actually launches the nuclear weapon.It's an OK release, but the Japanese version is much better.My Rating - The Return of Godzilla (Japanese Release) - 10/10.

Instead of continuing the story from the Showa era, Toho decided to make this as a direct sequel to the 1954 classic, ignoring everything in between which was a wise decision. The result was this great classic.Thirty years after Godzilla's rampage in Tokyo and his apparent death that came after, a fishing ship goes missing. The survivor tells that he saw a massive monster come out near the volcano Mt. Mihara located on a small island with mutant sea lice that killed his crew. Soon enough, more strange incidents have occurred and soon enough the culprit reveals itself Godzilla himself! With everything thrown into chaos, can man's more current weapons stop the legendary King of the Monsters? To some degree, this is Godzilla at his scariest. Everything in this movie emphasizes that effects, music, action, suspense, and even low camera angles. It truly makes Godzilla live up to his reputation as an unstoppable force of nature and this gives chills to my spine. There's a scientist in this movie that sympathizes with the monster king who makes a few scientific discoveries that also make Godzilla as more of an intelligent being rather than a mindless beast, which makes the monster more interesting. The action scenes are just awesome, especially Godzilla's final fight with the flying tank, the Super X. Explosions and buildings crumbling everywhere are what it's all about. The U.S. version recasts Raymond Burr as his character Steve Martin who basically tells the U.S. military all he knows about Godzilla and advises NOT to fight the creature for it would be a useless move.The only real disappointing thing about this movie is that Godzilla doesn't fight any monsters, but that's a minor complaint. Overall, this is definitely one of the best Godzilla movies. Check it out and try to avoid being stepped on. Hail the King of the Monsters!

Let me start by saying you haven't truly seen this film if you saw Godzilla 1985. The American cut of this film is a plain molestation of the original cut. King of the Monsters was a not too shabby flick, but this is horrendous. 12 minutes were cut out, which took away from the story. It went from a serious Cold War epic of an G-film with dignity and excellent dramatic tension to a propaganda film portraying Russians as terrorists. Plus those added American scenes are pretty much useless to the story . Raymond Burr returns as Steve Martin, who simply just sits there and watches the destruction of Tokyo on a big screen TV and gives an occasional line of dialogue that, again, doesn't contribute anything to the story. Actually, he tries to confuse us with what Godzilla wants, when it is made clear in the story his goal is to feed off nuclear energy. There's even a whole scene about this! To make things worse, he also from time to time pulls out this serpent medallion and stares down at it, making us wonder, again, WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE STORY?! Complete garbage!! If you see the Japanese cut, then you'll stop butchering the film and realize what I did; this movie is great! My top reason for loving this movie is, after nearly ten years of being a campy good guy, Godzilla has finally returned to being a malevolent yet symbolic creature.The SFX were spectacular for their time and his rampage was very well done. The rampage was just as haunting and dark as the original Gojira actually, and you get the true sense Godzilla is a nightmare straight out of hell. Speaking of which, Godzilla looked realistic and I love the snarling feature given to the animatronic head. It gives a lot of emotion and realism to the Monster King. The Super X was a nice edition and was as great as any monster foe. The battle between it and Godzilla was very cool. The story was well put together and didn't go too far. The human characters are involving and the drama is well played. There's a hell of a lot more deep and thought-out characterization in the original cut, as if that even need be said. Plus the music was dark and terrifying, and also gave a feeling of awe to the Monster king. The tone of the film is also dark and pretty serious, even cleverly taking on the issue of the Cold War and nuclear weapons. My favorite two parts are when Godzilla takes out that helicopter, causing it to crash right into traffic, causing in turn a huge explosion. And when Godzilla knocks that building onto the downed Super-X, destroying it permanently.Anyways, this movie brought back Godzilla as a towering menace, and it is no doubt one of THE best G-films, one of my favorites. My spent much of my life with a VHS tape of the American cut and truly had no real idea what this film actually meant. I am more than glad to now own the Japanese original cut in all its glory.

It wasn't until much later that I realize I was watching a butchered, practically raped version, of a classic allegorical monster movie.The original, Japanese version, called The Return of Godzilla is by far superior. It just has so much more power than the Americanized version, symbolizing the horrors of nuclear war and violence in a fresh new perspective almost as powerful as that achieved in the very first Godzilla film. First of all, it has a lot of more scenes involving the characters, thus leading to more plot and character development. So many questions are answered, including the origins of the giant sea louse on board the ship, and most importantly of all, why Godzilla would suddenly appear out of the blue after thirty long years of absence. And acting is a plus, a rare thing found in any Godzilla film.And as for the main star himself, Godzilla, he looked great! True, he didn't look perfect in every single scene (he is after all a man in a rubber suit). So to make up for this, Godzilla was only shown in two scenes of the movie and to make it more dark and terrifying, they were both at night. Throughout the rest of the movie, as a result, it brings this more chilling feeling where you know the monster's out there and that it truly is dangerous. It's not the old feeling where monsters appear almost every day. The graphics used for Godzilla's death-ray are perfect, just as realistic as the effects used for the plasma beams in The Terminator which was made at the same time. Godzilla's final attack on Tokyo is spectacular, also with great new scenes, and no longer is Godzilla stomping through a cardboard city!The music score, conducted and composed by Reijiro Koroku, is arguably the best in any Godzilla film to date. The soundtrack is a collection of pieces of all emotions horror, emotional, love, tranquility, sadness. The ending theme is heartbreaking, even to non-Godzilla fans.The Americanized version had scenes of Raymond Burr and other American actors (who were terrible at their job) inserted and they ruined the overall power of the film. And also, subtitles spoken by the Russians were altered in the Americanized version, to make the Soviet Union seem like the enemy of the world. But in the original masterpiece, nobody is the enemy. Not even Godzilla, who is just an innocent creature trying to survive and is bringing the world together in an ironic way.There are only two aspects to the Americanized version that were good one, a replacement of sound effects. I have to agree that some of the sound effects, mostly explosions, needed replacing. Including the scene where Godzilla fights the jets in Tokyo Bay. That, and also Raymond Burr's somber speech at the end. Although this is a cool feature, it really wasn't necessary. And the original, silent ending of the Japanese version is by far better.Overall, The Return of Godzilla is an underrated classic and it definitely deserves more recognition in the U.S. Critics and audiences just need to put the campy Godzilla films of the 60s and 70s behind them and learn that the series had changed. This 1980s classic is definitely one of the best monster movies ever made and it has everything a Hollywood movie has. Highly recommended.

Terror of Mechagodzilla was to be the last Godzilla film for a while, but there were actually a couple of proposals between it and Return of Godzilla. Godzilla vs Gargantua was proposed for 1978 but never happened, and Godzilla vs Asuka Fortress was to be for 1979. I think Toho made the right decision. If nothing else, it certainly created quite a build up for this film in 1984 (or 1985 for us Americans).If you disliked the campy and more child-friendly Godzilla flicks that had succeeded the dark original, you'll appreciate Return of Godzilla greatly. The dark, somber theme coincides with a much more menacing, far less campy Godzilla. Godzilla is bigger and looks ferocious. His atomic ray (along with other special effects) have been upgraded considerably, although there are still the oft-mentioned quirks with the mechanical head and other here-and-there's. The earlier part of the film with the Shockirus, a mutated louse that feeds on people by sucking them dry, adds a jumpy scene or two and tells the audience right away that this isn't your kid-friendly Godzilla's Revenge movie.The plot is also fairly topical, something that couldn't be said for a lot of Godzilla movies. No goofy looking aliens, no underground communities, but we do have the Cold War and Russian-American tensions. The only somewhat larger flaw I found with the American version as compared to the Japanese version was the cut explanation for the Shockirus. I suspect it would have been nice to have that scene, but you can't have everything.Toho did a pretty good job, both in the movie and in returning Godzilla to his roots. They continued this excellence with the film's sequel five years later, 1989's Godzilla vs Biollante.

In fact through the entire Hesei Series Godzilla is a villain. I like to think that by making Godzilla a villain that the people in charge of these films are admitting that Godzillla is better as a villain and the whole concept of him being a hero to japan made his popularity decline a bit. Godzilla looks pretty good, he has fangs in this one so he looks pretty scary. There is nothing comical about Godzilla in this one, he is a villain and shows no sympathy for anything in his way.This film is very similar to Godzilla King of the Monsters. It is just Godzilla, no other monsters are in it if you do not include a species of sea lice that appears briefly at the beginning. It is just Godzilla going after Japan, not much more to the story. I do like how it flashes back to Godzilla King of the Monsters, that lets viewers know that it is not a re make.

After re watching the original version, I have to say it was much better than the re-Burred(his 2nd Goji film I might add)film I saw.The movie is a sequel to the original film, and ignores all the cheesy(though fun)sequels before it.It goes back to Godzillas dark, destructive roots. No other monsters in here (besides the Shockilas)just Godzilla destroying Tokyo again.Great music, location (for 1984 Tokyo, NYC and LA now still didn't look caught up.), and action.See this movie now!

This is one of those movies.One thing I have to comment on is the suit design. In my opinion it is perfect. The Beasteal image, the menacing features and the sense of immense power. All this is conveyed by the suit alone which puts it in the number one spot of suit Godzilla designs.The soundtrack is mesmerising. It adds to the intensely dark atmosphere and the gloom. It adds to the dark atmosphere and the emotion, I love a bit of emotion, it adds an extra dimension to the characters and a film.As for the acting what to say. Each actor and actress puts their heart into the performance.Another thing I feel I have to mention are the sets. They are the best out of the whole series. In most of the millennium films the sets seem rather slap and dash and not much effort has been put into them.Overall a masterpiece and should be praised.By the way I think I should mention I have never seen the American version. So please do not be surprised that I have not made a comparison.

As absurd as Godzilla is, you feel for the Big Guy in this one. You really do. And Godzilla was more powerful and more menacing than I ever remember seeing him in any other film in this one. This was what Godzilla should look like.I think this is one of those films, that over time may dwell a sort of cult following.

In the US version, Burr reprises his role as reporter Steve Martin (although they didn't state the name directly due to the existence of a certain wild and crazy guy).Another thing that I notice is that the diverse filmographies of the cast members. Everyone knows Raymond Burr from his TV roles and from Rear Window. Eitaro Ozawa starred in Ugetsu and Taketoshi Naito starred in The Burmese Harp, both of which dealt with the effects of World War II on Japan. Dubbing Goro Maki is Tony Plana, best known as the dad on Ugly Betty.But above all, the movie is about the monster himself.

This time they bring in American and Russian military to the scene. A Russian submarine gets attacked and they blame the Americans for the happening. When they figure out that this is Godzilla returning back they want to use atomic warfare on it. But like the original Godzilla movie from 1954 the Japanese still have not forgotten the Hiroshima bombing and refuse to let the Russians and Americans use atomic bombs on Godzilla. They want to find another way to stop him.Actors These actors are not the best I have seen but did a fairly good job in this movie. Ken Tanaka have not been playing in any big things that I think people outside of Asia would know of. Yasuko Sawaguchi have acted in a bit more known works, like Godzilla vs. Biollante (1989), she have also been in another Toho Company monster movie called Orochi the Eight-Headed Dragon (1994). Yosuke Natsuki on the other hand may be the one who have played in most notable movies of these actors. The most well known movie he have starred in may be the Akira Kurosawa movie Yojimbo (1961), He have also been in other monster movies like Beauty and the Liquid Man (1958), Dagora the Space Monster (1964), Gihdorah the Three-Headed Monster (1964). Keiju Kobayashi have also been starring in a lot of movies but most of them not very well known outside of Asia. Maybe most known for his role in Kurosawa movie Sanjuro (1962). I actually think he did the best performance of the actors in this movie as the prime minister. Cinematography The sets here are all good like you expect from the Toho Studios when creating monster movies. The charming fact of the movies they make is what I mean is good cinema when you keep away from CGI at most. Like rockets from military wagons and planes they have created it themselves and it does not look very real but it looks cool. When you see they fire on Godzilla it is very cool scenes. The only CGI in most Godzilla movies are the radioactive breath that comes out of the mouth of Godzilla. I don't know if we should call it CGI actually but it is the closest to it you get in these movies. They create miniature versions of the cities and then the monster can go rampage there and it looks cool. And take note of what I say, it is not very good looking like wow but it looks cool and charming effect. Outside of all these bad CGI effects we get from Hollywood movies. One cool thing to take in mind before seeing this movie is a scene where a helicopter gets blasted down you see a billboard in the background of the Ghostbusters logo.Music/Sound The music is nothing very special in this one but the sound in Godzilla movies is always a treat. The roar of Godzilla is the best monster sound ever. The only thing that comes near may be the sound of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, and that sound was inspired by the sound of the original Godzilla movie. Costume/Make-up In costumes I guess the only thing that can be mentioned is always the costume of Godzilla. It is a man inside that monster and that is what I love so much about the monsters in Asian monster movies. Not a computer generated monster but as close to the real thing that you can get and the costume is very good and detailed. The only other costumes to mention might be the ones that the military uses and well they are as they should be.Summary This is the first real sequel since the original Godzilla movie from Toho. And the first Godzilla movies since the original where he do not meet another monster to fight. The directors of this movie Koji Hashimoto and R.J. Kizer have not done much in main directing but many other movie related jobs. This movie is very good in the way that they wanted to take Godzilla to where he started if they succeeded or not is for each and everyone to decide. It may be a better watch for those loving the concept then the normal viewer. If you want the typical Hollywood way of movies stay away. If you like monster movies and foreign movies go for it. I liked it very much so this review may give you a bit of what to expect. Or point you in direction of other movies in the same genre.

Anyway,I'll get on with the review. I had mixed feelings about this film. There are elements of this film which I like, and others that I don't.I'll start with the things I do like. For one thing, the soundtrack is brilliant, perhaps on a par with Ifukube's music. It is dark and foreboding, giving the movie a real ominous feeling. Next is the effects work. I'm a longtime fan of suitmation, which I feel is an unappreciated special effects style. Not to mention the intricate Tokyo set. I love miniatures, and the mini Tokyo in this film is a doozy. I really love the opening, and also the first time we see Godzilla, emerging from the mist, growling threateningly, and subsequently destroying the power plant. It's a truly brilliant moment, especially with that tense and creepy music playing.Now for the things I don't enjoy. For one, when Godzilla finally does show up in Tokyo, it's a bit of an anticlimax. Big G doesn't really destroy much, he just walks around a bit. Don't get me wrong, the rampage isn't the only reason for watching the movie, but it is an integral part of many Godzilla movies (I say many because in some of the films there is very little city destruction, as they focus more on the combat of the monsters, which is fine for films with two or more monsters, because you don't need the city destruction as much when monsters are fighting), and the fact that Tokyo is left largely intact is disappointing to me. This one only applies to the bastardized version only, and of course, that is, the added scenes of American actors. Pointless, dull, bad acting and annoying. So that's my two scents on Godzilla 1985, or The Return of Godzilla, or just Godzilla. Whatever you want to call it.

The Japanese version of this film is certainly much better than what would be done with the American version, which turned into a complete disaster for the studio when released in 1985. However, this Japanese version actually stays closer in tone to the original film from 1954 and I think it's rather interesting that the filmmakers pretty much overlooked every other Godzilla movie except for that original. For the most part I think the film is a success, although there's certainly some flaws to be found including the 102-minute running time, which just has a few too many slow spots. This is especially true early on as we keep waiting for the big guy to appear. Once Godzilla does finally show up we're treated to a pretty good monster flick. Thankfully the Godzilla costume is a lot better than what we had previously seen up to this point with the mouth really benefiting from being more flexible. I also thought that costume design was good for the most part. The special effects on the other hand weren't any more impressive than they were in 1954. The entire stomping on buildings isn't exactly grand work but I think fans will enjoy the charm of them. Performacnes were decent for the most part but do we really come to these movies for acting? Again, I think the film would have benefited from being trimmed down some but there's still no question that the film is fun for fans of the series.Godzilla 1985 (1984) ** (out of 4)This is the American version of the 1984 Japanese film that had the beloved Godzilla returning to the big screen. It should go without saying but overall the Japanese version is the one to watch and it's easy to see why American critics ripped this thing to shreds and why so many people stayed away from the theater. For starters, this film runs just 87-minutes whereas the Japanese one ran 102-minutes. I really don't mind the shorter running time because I found the Japanese version to be too long but the added scenes with Raymond Burr really don't bring anything to the picture except for a connection to the original American version. You can check out various websites (including this one) for the alternate scenes here and there are a few funny changes including the bit with the Russian sub. The biggest problem with this film is obviously the extremely bad dubbing job, which just brings the film down several levels. The seriousness of the Japanese film is pretty much lost through the dubbing.

Of course, in Godzilla 1985 (which is 1984 in Japan time), Godzilla returns to his old stomping grounds of Tokyo. He first attacks a fishing boat and kills everyone on-board except one, then a Soviet submarine, a nuclear reactor (which is where we see the glorious Big Guy for the first time), and finally has his eyes set on Tokyo. What hinders this film big time, especially in the American version, are the ugly Cold War-era politics that played into many of the film's changes in order to accommodate polarized audiences in the United States. Russians are portrayed as being inherently evil and the Japanese are shown as being weak and totally dependent on America. But by making America the hero in this picture, Americans are shown as being quite pigheaded and arrogant and stupid, with the exception of Raymond Burr, who also appeared in the American version of the original Godzilla (1954). (So it looks like the American producers really screwed themselves big time with this transition.) This seriously makes the movie dated and draws attention away from the stronger, more relevant issues the original Japanese screenwriters had envisioned. On the plus side, Toho created a rather terrifying and truly menacing Godzilla, whose presence is made all the more frightening by those blood-red eyes and thunderous roar of his. This Godzilla is the embodiment of true screen menace, in a return-to-form from the previous incarnation in the '70s. Even though he is the villain in this picture, one could shed a tear at the film's ending (which you wouldn't need to do if you care to watch the superior 1989 sequel Godzilla vs. Biollante). The special effects are magnificent, though dated; one of my particular favorite sequences is Godzilla's showdown with the Super X attack fighter and his attack on the nuclear reactor.I'd recommend this entry only if you're a die-hard kaiju-eiga fan; if not, you should probably skip this one and go straight to Godzilla vs. Biollante, which is my personal favorite Godzilla film from the second generation.

Ergo, without the Raymond Burr scenes and the hefty changes made (why do those yanks always insist on messing with Japanese originals?). The box called it the Return of Godzilla-As a kaiju film on it's own, it's nice enough. As a big 80's-90's return to the screen for Goji, it's dreadfully underwhelming. There are quite some good things in here; the film does a good job of establishing a more dark and menacing atmosphere. Godzilla is a proper monster in this movie in that he should be feared, and with no other big monster to battle against him around, he's suddenly lots more tricky to get rid of. Alas, he's also a little dull on his own in this film. There's a long and slow build-up before the destruction actually begins. But when Goji does finally reach Tokyo, the city-stomping that ensues in much more sedate and uneventful than what the viewer's been hoping for, and doesn't manage to really satisfy one. Instead, Goji spends a lot of time just standing around, and leaving lots of large buildings simply untouched (while you very badly -want- to see him smash them up). Once he's killed off in a rather daft way, you're left with a pretty empty was that everything? feeling.Furthemore, the Godzilla suit doesn't look all that slick and modern. In facial close-up shots, his eyes look painfully plastic-like, for instance. The numerous scenes of people excitedly running about, trying to avert or escape from more catastrophes do add suspense (there's the whole atomic missile subplot as well), but we were hoping for a good new Goji flick, not a cold war drama story.Although disappointing on the whole, as a curiosity, it's worth a go for kaiju fans, and shows an interesting darker, more menacing side of Godzilla that rarely surfaces outside of the original 1950's film (and perhaps Godzilla vs Destroyah). One really has to feel sorry for the over-stressed prime minister in this movie. The man deserves a good vacation in Okinawa after all that ^^. Despite it's shortcomings, kaiju die-hards can still enjoy this more or less (others needn't bother, there are better giant monster flicks for them out there). And of course, even this rather low-level Goji entry can still wipe the floor with that pathetic Tri-Star Godzilla travesty any day. Granted, that's not saying very much, but oh well...

Sure, they look awful cheesy nowadays as they're either polystyrene monsters or a man in a rubber suit, but I'm able to empathize with the audiences of that age and realize that back then they were the real deal. Ultimately the most highly regarded among fans is the 1984 movie entitled The Return of Godzilla (though in Japan originally called Gojira, but later re titled to avoid confusion with the 1954 movie). The film is also set in Japan during the Cold War and attempts to return Godzilla back to his more horrific roots, as a reminder of why nuclear weapons are bad. There's a lot to love about this movie but there's also just a tad too much to hate about it, which is why I find myself split down the middle on this one. It is no secret that the 1970s/1960s Godzilla movies were truly bad at times but were guilty pleasures- but to see this film try to make Godzilla a terrifying natural disaster again is very refreshing. With the dark atmosphere enhanced by its Cold War setting and obvious allusions to the tensions between the US and Russia, sadly what really squanders this film's potential is the horrible direction. The plot is simple and effective, but there's too much of a dissonance between the writers' script and engaging storyline (the government discovers that Godzilla is attracted to birds calling and sets up a sound signal to lure him to a volcano for him to fall into), and that's a problem. In fact, it's almost as if the director thought he was directing a different filmThe attack scenes have tons of potential to be terrifying and sadly they're ruined by threadbare and lazy direction. When Godzilla takes his stroll through Tokyo, we don't get the impression that this event is terrifying mostly because while it's obvious that so much detail went into the suit and the miniature sets, the scene as a whole feels static. In fact, there's also an animatronic Godzilla used for setups and it's easy to tell which scenes use the animatronic Godzilla. Those scenes look oddly too mechanical. And while the finale will jerk some tears from the audience, it's really the only scene that has any impact. Which is a shame because the film could be terrifying. In fact, luckily the goal of making us scared of Godzilla was achieved five years later with Godzilla Vs. Biollante, which is a truly exceptional film.

Both USA & USSR offer to annihilate Godzilla using atomic weapons. The Japanese refuse & they seem to concede, but would we trust commies one inch? No way. They have an undercover missile launcher in orbit and a tracker ship right in the Tokyo bay. Worse comes to worse & the bad guys in red launch atomic warheads against Tokyo only Americans can save the day launching a counter missile. c) G's eyes look like Terminator, although it still maintains the teddy bear looks of the 60's, although more rugged ( this movie is supposedly a direct sequel to the 1954 movie ). This is not your typical low budget monster movie it's a decent mid-carder with decent SFX and another cameo for supa-X, some flying war machine soon to be replaced by mechas. There are a few character subplots as well... survivor from the slaughtered crew saved by reporter, who in turn falls in love with the survivor's sister; a scientist understanding how waves/noise by some birds can attract G's attention; cold war reunions, etc. Not bad but not a movie you'd watch twice.

On the positive side it is a return to the darker, more serious tone of the original film.  It also contains some good ideas, such as the fact a Godzilla 'body louse' would be big enough to regard human beings as convenient junk food.  But it seems to run out of steam halfway through, is very badly edited, Godzilla doing nothing but standing about for long periods of time.  The Dr Pepper scenes just turn the whole thing into an excuse for commercialism.  Certain scenes have also been re-done to cast the Americans as peace-lovers and the Russians as missile-loving war-mongers (funny how I seem to remember them being the other way round in real life).If you liked the original Godzilla then you'll maybe get something out of this as it's intended as an alternative sequel, but otherwise personally I'd look to the 1991 Godzilla Vs Ghidorah if you want updated Big-G.

However, I was extremely disappointed that they would ignore all the films that came out after the first film and make him evil once again.  I guess I'm in the minority when I say that I prefer Godzilla as a hero.  Also, after this film was such a hit, the series went back into its old handicap of bad effects especially due to the fact that the old master Eiji Tsubaraya was by now deceased.

H3 tried the devious step of taking the HALLOWEEN series away from Michael Myers and into a new direction of Halloween-themed horror movies. It could have been a great idea, but the film (while sporadically awesome) wasn't that great and angered many fans.GODZILLA 1985 (or 1984 if you are a purist) tried to radically shift the Godzilla series away from the goofy superhero Godzilla and back to his roots of being an evil menace 2 society. It could have been awesome, and it is in bits and pieces, but the overall film was too lackluster to continue the trend. All the subsequent Godzilla films went back to the campy monster vs. monster theme, but have wisely decided to keep Godzilla more malevolent, though they lack the dark tone of this film.The special effects are definitely a huge improvement over any of the previous Godzilla films and are really the highlight of this film. The finely detailed miniatures are certainly more realistic than any of the overdone cartoon CGI of newer movies. There's a few really standout sequences from a pyrotechnic standpoint - such as when Godzilla battles some Mitsubishi F-1 fighters, then the Japanese army on the docks, but especially his fight with the Super X attack craft. The little hover-tank manages to kill Godzilla, but he reawakens and boy is he P*SSED! The subsequent battle is the highlight of the entire Godzilla series, with the Super X desperately trying to get away while unloading everything it's got on him with lots of nifty explosions. It made me feel sorry for the actor in the Godzilla suit.The US and Japanese versions differ pretty dramatically. The US cut is a lot shorter and edited a little more excitingly with added music from DEF-CON IV (1984), but has absolutely useless new scenes with Raymond Burr. The Japanese version is much longer and has a lot of new dialog, exposition, special effects shots (including a horrible full-size Godzilla foot), and is arranged so that there's a lot more overlap in subplots. As to which one is better is a matter of personal preference. I actually prefer the US version, just because Godzilla's scream at the end is really, really shrill and creepy, giving the ending a much-needed emotional punch. However, it doesn't have the poignant ending theme song Goodbye Now Godzilla, in heavily accented English.

The rather bizarre decision was taken to ignore all the other Godzilla films before except the very first one,and have this one as a direct sequel to that film. More commendably,it was decided to return to a more serious style and have Godzilla as a menace again. Therefore there is no wrestling with other monsters or such like,this is as much a remake of the original as well as a sequel.Sadly,the film is still somewhat disappointing. The pace is extremely slow,and while this was fine in the original due to the dark,brooding atmosphere of that film and the fact the fact that it's human characters were interesting,here,there is little atmosphere and the humans are boring. This is one Godzilla film that could actually be called dull at times. Scenes of people sitting down and talking sometimes go on forever,although the political dimension does give the film a little depth. Effects are generally good,the new suit is impressive except for the ping-pong eyes,and there are a few great action scenes,such as a battle between Godzilla and the 'Super X'machine with both of them on either side of a skysraper. However we are sadly denied a big destruction sequence like in the original,and Godzilla is vanquished in the most pathetic way imaginable,although there is a touch of poignance in the last scene.The US version is a mixed bag. Having Raymond Burr return was a good idea,but he has nothing to do. The pace was quickened,but the political aspect was crudely simplified such as having the Russians fire a missile on purpose rather than by mistake,some scenes were oddly edited,and the less said about the Dr Pepper plugs the better. It's certainly not a great Godzilla film,but it deserved better treatment.

Yes, this one was mainly made to reinvent Godzilla as one bad destructive monster rather than the one that helped man for no apparent reason.  This one awakens and of course proceeds to destroy Tokyo.  For some reason they felt the need to splice in Raymond Burr footage that is not part of the Japanese cut and adds nothing to the flick.  The reason I don't like this one is that I have always preferred to see Godzilla fight something, anything rather than just toy tanks and stuff.  Of course, everything that gets thrown at him is tossed aside like the toys they are and the Japanese have to devise another more tricky way to kill him.  To bad he isn't like the American version...they could take that one out with a pistol.

The effects are nearly identical to the original; the weaponry is a touch more advanced and the gunfire, etc looks more polished, but it's hard to tell the difference - i feels re-hashed. As the story does. Once again, this Godzilla film is simply an excuse to show a rampage through Japan; it lacks the *story* that the original few films had. There wasn't *much* of a story, but at least it was there.Raymond Burr is cool, as always, but he's under-used. And his dialogue is over-preachy; it lacks the strength of the original.The American and Russian military men are portrayed as power-hungry, violent rednecks. Okay, not *that* far from reality, but was *way* overdone.All in all, this would be absolutely horrid if some of the others weren't so much worse. At the same time, at least most other Godzilla films had *really* cheezy monsters everywhere to take our minds off of how bad the films were;) This is just a second-rate Godzilla; nearly identical to the original in all ways save quality-wise. 4/10.
