[{"Title":"Death Wish 3 Unintentionally the Funniest Movie Ever?","Date":"27 July 2004","Score":"83 out of 100 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point Ms. Davis says, I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make, to which Kersey deftly responds, Chicken's good. I like chicken. If that's not English Grammar 101, I don't know what is.Another thing about this Ms. Davis character Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells him she wants to see him one last time(this being only the fourth time they've ever met) before she moves to her sister's house in Binghamton,NY to get away from the creeps; then he really doesn't even bat an eye while her corpse is burning in the street only minutes later. Kersey never even says her first name through the entirety of the film. Not once. Never a Get over here, Katy, or a That's a nice dress you wearing, Kathryn or a Be careful, Katie, or the creeps'll get ya!And while this 'love' is developing between the two, Fraker(Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps his ever-watchful eyes on them. It's almost as if Kersey is using her as bait to get to Fraker, much as he uses the camera or the car. Sure enough, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites back hard...in the most incredible sequence of events ever caught on film! The final fifteen or so minutes are possibly rivaled only by the final thirty minutes of Delta Force in their brilliance. And that's giving Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other film can you see Ed Lauter take out Alex Winter in order to get Charles Bronson's back, a troubled gang leader seemingly calling a hotline to summon neo-nazi bikers to come to his aid, and nimble Broadway dancers wearing mesh halter-tops posing as street punks, all laid down to a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If that's not the highest of high comedy, then nothing is funny.Truthfully speaking, there are a thousand ways to state the unintentional comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to watch it and judge for yourself.

I must have watched this movie dozens of times, yet each time it is just as ridiculously funny. From the outset the movie explodes with laughs. Kersey's trip to jail, where he is threatened by some thug, who apparently high on goof balls, decides to attack the most giant guy in the jail for no reason and is bloodily beaten down. At this point he turns back to Kersey and curses him like it is his fault! Make no sense? Don't let that stop you, there is more where that came from. Next the police inspector beating Kersey up, then abruptly out of nowhere saying, `you see, I'm a big fan of yours'! . There are so many other hilarious plot inconsistencies. Mr.Kaprov saying `Mr.Kersey, it's 90 degrees outside!' as he is wearing a full shirt and thick sweater! Or Kersey's friend Charlie, who somehow managed to smuggle back two massive machine guns from Korea. Did he take that in his carryon luggage on the trip back? Add to all this lame romance that Kersey and the public defender have and you have the making of a masterpiece. For whatever reason, the desperate woman wants a date with Kersey. The romance that ensues is epic, until unfortunately, like all women that Kersey dates, she is horribly killed.  The final piece of the puzzle is some of the best one liners in any movie. Some include, `it's your wife, she is sick or... something' Fraker, `bulletproof just like yours asshole' Fraker, `they call him the giggler, he laughs when he runs' Bennet, I'll kill a little old lady for you. Catch it on the 6 o'clock news! Fraker. I could go on and on. You owe it to yourself to rent this extraordinary film. Truly one of the greatest ever made!

That kind of says it all really. Why bother with laws, why bother with a constitution and why bother with a police force &#150; they only get in the way. What you really need to keep the streets safe is a big gun&#133;and lots of bullets&#133;and maybe a machine gun&#133; and perhaps a rocket launcher too. Because, hey, if those liberal pinkos have their way there will only be anarchy.Paul Kersey's day starts off really badly. Not only do synthesisers, weeping saxophones, twangy guitars and a smarmy piano accompany his trip to New York, but by the time he gets there his best mate has been killed. How unlucky can you get? Well, to make matters worse, one of the people that kills his best mate is Bill S. Preston, Esq. Oh, and when he gets there, just as his friend is dying in his arms, he gets arrested for his murder. Damn. But then, after getting beaten up by the police, ramming a fat porker's bulbous head through prison bars and enraging the head of a local gang, he gets unofficial approval from the stupid chief to go on a one man killing rampage&#133;which is nice.Death Wish 3 is a guilty pleasure. After all, it's dumb, it's fascistic and it's badly filmed, but a number of people greater than the population of San Marino get brutally killed, so it rules. I mean, how can you not dig a film where people are set on fire, thrown off buildings and shot at point blank range with a rocket launcher? Anyone with a penis should enjoy this. So if you don't like it, you're probably either a woman or Dale Winton.Where do I start when it comes to the best death in Death Wish 3? The rocket launcher killing is a classic, but the firebombing is probably even better &#150; the punks firebomb the flat of an elderly couple and they come running out, in flames, and then get mowed down with Uzis. But then there's death by broom and all the machine gun slayings. However, I also dig the bit when a bunch of bikers, in leather daddy gear, get blasted to pieces by a bunch of disgruntled neighbourhood residents. An armed society is a polite society.But this praise for other characters takes away from the Bronsoninator's contribution. Never before has one man killed so many people. He mows down punks with his mate's Browning and then he blows them away with his unfeasibly huge Magnum &#150; normally I'd suggest that Bronson was making up for certain shortcomings, but there's no way the man wasn't hung. And it's his Magnum technique that impresses most. He can dodge a hail of bullets simply by slowly crouching down on one knee. Genius! And then there are the people he kills. One man, who's trying to rape a black woman, is the spitting image of Freddie Mercury. Another, who he throws off a roof, is Frost out of Aliens. And he even kills The Giggler! They killed The Giggler, man! They killed The Giggler! But perhaps the best Bronson killing is the one where he coolly kills a couple of punks who are trying to nick his car. At the time he's having dinner with a Jewish couple, but he politely excuses himself, shoots the punks and finishes his grub. What a gentleman.But it's not all fun and games. Bronson's lady gets killed. But the woman should have known better. Any woman that gets close to the Bronsoninator is immediately doomed. It's the James Bond rule. I mean, we can't have our bloodthirsty heroes suddenly become happy and content, can we? So she has to die. And at least she goes out in style. She gets a headbutt for her troubles and then succumbs in a car crash. Of course, just in case she might survive, the car spontaneously blows up. You've got to make sure.Not that any of this seems to bother Bronson. He merely goes along with his bloodthirsty rampage, squinting at the targets he's going to blow into bloody pieces. And what of his targets? Well, the gang he takes on is isn't especially formidable. In fact, they're rather camp. They wear bandanas, headbands, string vests, fingerless gloves, sleeveless shirts, leather jackets, chain belts, lots of studs and one even wears a cute little cut off vest so that he can show off his rock hard abs. Actually, now that I think about it, they dress and prance like a bunch of failed Fame auditionees. Perhaps that's why they're so mad. They just want to be in a chorus line but they can't get a gig. Maybe that's why they kidnap, rape and kill the Mexican lady. They want to get their own back on any tang they can get their hands on. The way they emerge from their hiding place &#150; the bushes, of course &#150; certainly suggests this. They leap out like coked-up ballerinas. But they all get brutally killed, so their Broadway ambitions go unfulfilled.But hey, who cares about the punks? Not I. Indeed, Death Wish 3 has made me see the light. All we need to keep the streets safe are viscous vigilantes, dispensing their wonderful brand of arbitrary justice. Only then will we be free from the tyranny of punks, hoods and lowlifes. I never knew that a Jewish food critic could be so delightfully fascist.

And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil. Bronson, at least the older version, is truly at his best.I'm not saying DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. Indeed to the discriminating eye it has a plethora of imperfections. The characters are generally made of cardboard. The violence is over the top. A man well into his 60s outruns and outspooks dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original DEATH WISH and later films such as FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, it has a definite crowd-pleasing charm. Who doesn't want to see gangbangers get their due? There are also some great cheesy moments and one-liners so common in 1980s films. When a tenant of his apartment building sees Kersey setting up a booby trap, for instance, the vigilante lightheartedly says he's thinning the herd. A line only Bronson can truly make work.So you see, the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It ain't Spielberg and it ain't art. So throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it.

In my opinion, this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever.  This movie doesn't take itself seriously, because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans, not for the critics, and it works.  DW3 has been unfairly criticized as trash and a weary entry in a worn out series.  These statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement, but it wasn't.  If you take it as what it is, DW3 is just a fun, action packed romp, with Charlie doing to street punks what we all wish we could do.  The action is non stop, the atmosphere is great, and the movie is just out and out the best Bronson flick ever made.  You can tell that the penny pinching Cannon group spent a lot of money on this one.  It is believed that Bronson thought this film was too violent, and that was the reason why Winner didn't direct any of the following entries.  I can understand his concern, but as is always the case of sequels, you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry.  In any case, this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time.  What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite film ever (not the best, just my favorite), is the action, Charlie's presence, memorable villains, and it's ability to get the viewers to jump on the bandwagon.  The first film may be the most technically well made, but this one is the most fun.  For once, Charlie actually has some clever lines (although he doesn't say much)and a halfway interesting story, photography, action, and direction to back him up.  Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one.  Yes, it's exploitive, maybe it does promote stereotypes, and maybe it is the same story as before, but Bronson's films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see.  Many argue that the DW series manipulates its' audience, my reply is that the movies don't manipulate us, the fans are the ones in charge.  We demand that Bronson blow away deserving scum, and in turn Winner and Co. deliver the goods.  And for those of you who still want to put it down, remember a few things.  DW3 was the #1 movie in America when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics, they just have to be fun. **********/10 You can't get any better.

I do so love the violence when the East New York neighborhood awakes and throws off the rule of punks.After roaming the streets of New York in the first film and going back to Los Angeles in the second, Charles Bronson as the legendary urban vigilante Paul Kersey returns to New York to visit an old friend who is found murdered. He's questioned, but let go, but the police captain of the beleaguered 75th precinct which in real life does include the East New York area of Brooklyn, Ed Lauter, let's him go with a promise to unofficially do his vigilante thing in that neighborhood. It's getting so that the punks are seriously challenging the citizens in population growth.Back in the day the East New York area was this middle class neighborhood of homes and churches that so typified Brooklyn. It became a prime example of urban decay. I well recall a local Assemblyman Vito P. Battista who also ran for Mayor of New York several times, declaring that it looked like London after the Blitz. Vito wasn't far wrong. And that is the real East New York you are seeing, lots of blocks of abandoned buildings and empty lots.As in all Death Wish 3 films Bronson gets himself a woman and it's her death that galvanizes him into action. In this case it's Deborah Raffin who the punks set up in a fiery car crash. That last half hour of Death Wish 3 is an urban fantasy when the whole neighborhood becomes a battleground as Bronson leads an aroused populace to clean up the neighborhood. Can't describe it, you've got to see it to believe it. More urban slime gets eradicated here than in all the other Death Wish films put together.You have to see Death Wish 3, it's trashy, it's one of the most politically incorrect films ever made and great fun.

So Kersey takes up residence in his late friend's apartment, befriends those living there, starts seeing the public defence attorney and goes to work to finally rid this neighbour of their out-of-control mugs.Talk about over-the-top! The first two films were searing thrillers that realistically exploited its leering material with scathing pot shots or gritty intensity. Instead this addition (which would be director Michael Winner's final outing in the series) goes for an all-out action romp that's excessively cheesy and outrageously delirious. With that on mind. Most of the fun is to be had with this particular item of the franchise. The seriously dour nature of the earlier films don't really evolve within this one, because Winner favoured more of a tongue-in-cheek style of mayhem that basically parodies (don't know if it was intentional, though) what he done before. Suspenseful thrills are replaced by bigot action looking for nothing more than a large body count. This really does let loose in the film's cracking climax, where no one is safe from the colourfully cartoonish onslaught. What can one say? It's an urban jungle out there for some&#133; but Kersey sees it as a shooting parlour. And his well equipped (carrying a Wilbur Mangum and holding onto a rocket launcher) this time to take out the trash! Sadly though, Charles Bronson is looking terribly downtrodden in the role. He might be sleepwalking it, but what he brings to the table a resourceful character that you can't help but cheer on. Even though the feeble script doesn't emotionally pull you into his compassionate plight like the previous two. The contrived story is pretty much bare bones and very stereotypically (like the multi-race living in the apartment building who finally stand up for their rights as citizens) plotted. The police really do get a touch up in their incompetence of how they do things and their lack of actions. It really does leave a sour taste in your mouth, which I'm sure that's what it was aiming to do.While, the obligatory romance sub-plot is beyond forced and only there to give Kersey more motivation when needed. An adorable Deborah Raffin plays Bronson's love interested, but with her talent she's wasted in a throwaway part. Ed Lauter trumps in with a quality performance of the cutting, hard-nosed NY detective. Gavan O'Herlihy perfectly cooks up a storm in his nasty role as Fraker the gang leader. With features like his striking hairdo and cold-stare, he managed to reek of brute fear and be sufficient in leading the chaos. Making an appearance as one of the wild punks is a young Alex Winter (who'll be best known for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). The rest of the supporting cast are reasonable. Winner's direction is durably crafted and tautly laid out in its no-bars framework to shove it in your face. Again for such a lesser sequel, Winner makes it look reasonably up to par despite it being a flawed technical production. Although it is being set in NY, it was basically shot in London. Its stays on a few locations and at times they come across as purely sets. An impressive array of camera-work is on the ball by John Stainer. Attached to the music score was Jimmy Page again. Instead of the sickening riffs presented in number 2. It's oozing with a more sweepingly funky and overpoweringly scorching rhythm. Not as effective this time, but well suited.A different breed that might be considerably toned down in its rough exploitative nature, but the gung-ho violence does run freely and you got Bronson walking the walk&#133; of death.

The film has a crazy high body count, mercilessly killing easily over a hundred people, (He even kills the Giggler!

Mr. Kersey (Bronson) this time is heading back to Brooklyn (Sutter and Belmont to be exact) to visit an old war friend named Charlie, well Mr. Kersey gets a little more than he asked for once he arrives a dead friend, a false murder rap, thrown in jail (no bail), but all of the sudden the Chief really needs a 'Mr. Vigilante' to clean up the streets over the six block radius of Sutter and Belmont that has just exploded into chaos. So, guess who the chief turns to? Mr. Kersey sees this proposition as an opportunity to get out of the slammer and he surely takes it. From here, the action never lets up, this film is a lot more action-packed than the two previous outings, the machine gun rampage at the end is enjoyable and laughable at the same time. Oddly enough, the soundtrack is the same as the one used in Death wish 2, which was done by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin fame. These thugs are ugly, mean, nasty and give Mr. Kersey every reason in the world to blow 'em all away. Watch out for Kersey's best friend Wildey, he makes a nice guest appearance. A very watchable and laughable film, I enjoy every viewing the same.

First, Charles Bronson's character, Paul Kersey, would have a relative or close friend murdered by street scum. Further mayhem would befall ancillary characters so as to goad Kersey into a righteous killing frenzy. One significant variation that this formula allowed is that in each succeeding movie the weaponry Kersey will use to blow away assorted miscreants will get more and more elaborate. From the hand pistol Kersey used in the first Death Wish movie, we now get enormous elephantine hand guns that could actually kill a real elephant as well WWII Browning machine guns as well as grenade launchers by the third film. Also, the criminals Kersey is up against aren't just assorted street punks as in the first Death Wish film but now a criminal army with enough firepower to take on the Iraqi insurgents in Baghdad.What is truly striking in the last 30 minutes of the movie is that with the mayhem going on, the government didn't force the issue and send in the US Army to restore order as the Union Army did do in New York during the Draft Riots of 1863 while the Civil War was going on. Another priceless moment in the film is the ease with which Kersey is able to receive serious ordinance through the US mail. If it really was as easy as shown in the film, Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations really missed an opportunity in arming themselves in the US.Like I said, the film defines improbable to extremely unlikely. It's a revenge fantasy of truly baroque extremes and frankly enjoyable on that level. In the Death Wish world, there is no moral ambiguity. There are good decent people and then there are street scum. Here, the street scum harass, maim and kill the decent and the police are oddly helpless. Even though the criminals are dressed so garishly and distinctively from the characters who are good and decent, no one seems able to obtain any evidence against them. So, the only solution is just to shoot them dead. It's nice that the criminals in these films are all unredeemable psychopaths who dress quite distinctively so even a child could kill them with a clear conscience(as a few do in one of the many disturbing scenes at the end during the big shoot-out). In sum, not total trash, not really good, fascistic in a really simple-minded way (for a more complex pro-fascistic perspective, I recommend viewing the Depression political fantasy film, Gabriel over the White House, from 1933) that doesn't go beyond offering shooting street scum like turkeys as a way to solve crime but undeniably exciting.

In a single afternoon he witnesses more felonies than most of us will see in a lifetime.Paul's new neighborhood is a checkerboard of cinder-blocked windows, bodegas, flophouses and piles of rubble.

In the face of danger, its citizens brazenly (or ignorantly) go about their lives.

So instead I'm just going to list reasons why this picture rules. 1) Charles Bronson as the ever-unflappable Paul Kersey is the very epitome of stoic, laconic and unflappable vigilante cool; this guy not only kills countless low-life criminal scum with a winning mix of style and ingenuity, but also sports one hell of a snazzy mustache to boot. 2) The street gang featured in this flick is a pretty mean and colorful bunch Gavan O'Herlithy as vicious leader Fraker (you just have to love his gnarly reverse Mohawk haircut), a pre-Bill and Ted Alex Winter as the sleazy Hermosa, Ricco Ross as speed-snorting psycho Cuban, and, best of all, the incredible Kirk Taylor as swift, maniacal, chortling klepto the Giggler. Moreover, the gang is multi-racial, which enables the filmmakers to treat us to the touching and inspiring sight of various whites, blacks and Hispanics gleefully engaging in rape, murder, robbery, extortion, destruction of private property, and other such no-count nasty antics. 3) The dialogue is sheer cut-to-the-bone terse and eloquent poetry. Martin Balsam as tough World War II veteran Bennett Cross bellows the following heart-shattering lines as he watches his beloved place of business go down in flames My shop! My shop! That's my shop! 4) Deborah Raffin as feisty public defender Kathryn Davis supplies some mighty fetching eye candy. Alas, after Raffin becomes romantically involved with Bronson the poor gal gets bumped off by the bad guys. Boy, now isn't that a shocking and unexpected plot development? 5) This no-holds-barred fierce and unflinching flick declares open season on everyone pretty young women are raped (including foxy future Star Trek The Next Generation TV series regular Marina Sirtis), little old ladies are brutally butchered, countless evil street slime are blown away, folks are set on fire, and Fraker even gets blasted into the next dimension with a rocket launcher. If raw, savage and over-the-top violence is your thing, then this movie is your crack, baby! 6) The acting is truly Oscar-worthy. Special kudos here to Joseph Gonzalez as Rodriguez; the scene with Gonzalez punching a table with tremendous angst and fury after he's told that his wife has just died is positively gut-wrenching in its stark poignancy. 7) Bronson packs plenty of heavy artillery. Besides the aforementioned rocket launcher, Charlie also uses a Wildey automatic and a vintage Browning machine gun to waste the villains left and right. 8) Legendary rock musician Jimmy Page whips up an exceptionally funky-jammin' jazz-rock fusion score. 8) Director Michael Winner treats the laughably ludicrous material with deliriously misguided seriousness, thereby ensuring that the cartoonish carnage rates as often sidesplitting and always entertaining high camp at its all-time most gloriously absurd and wildly implausible. The last third with the already cruddy urban cesspool neighborhood degenerating into an all-out war zone is the hilarious stuff total kitsch is made of. A true 80's action masterpiece.

In the original Death Wish, Bronson used a snub-nosed pea shooter to take out the trash. But in this one, he used a variety of military grade weapons, including the .475 Wildey Magnum, surely one of the most iconic handguns ever, which he made famous with this movie (to this day, he is featured very prominently on Wildey's website). He also used a belt-fed Korean War era heavy machine gun and mail order rocket launcher, among others!! Pure '80s take-back-the-streets fantasy, but it's oh so fun. New York was a virtual war zone in the '80s, so the desire to simply blast the creeps and clean up the neighborhood was very attractive to many. Since you can't really do that, just let Paul Kersey do it!! By all conventional means, a terrible film, but I love it! Between the comically stereotyped characters such as the cartoon gangsters, the elderly Jewish couple, etc and numerous cheesy lines, there is no way to justify liking this other than pure BRONSON. Bronson's unflinching delivery is so simple and direct, and he has no moral objection whatsoever for example to baiting two punks that were trying to steal his car into a deadly showdown, which he wins of course.Highly recommended for Bronson fans!

So many scenes just make you go 'huh?' Not much makes sense.There are no developed scenes just constant cuts between such things as gruesome murders, gratuitous rapes, pointless violence or shots of Kersey (Bronson) building up his gigantic arsenal.These key weapon-accumulation scenes are Death Wish 3's equivalent of Rocky building up his muscles and one almost expects to hear getting strong now being sung in the background. Apart from two massive machine guns which a neighbour has stashed in a wardrobe (as you do), he gets most of his weaponry via mail order. Quite who is selling him this stuff is never revealed, but one suspects that it is the Acme company who supplies Wile. E. Coyote with his over the top gear. From this source, Kersey acquires a Wildey magnum used for blasting elephants (it makes a hell of a mess he says) and later a LAW rocket launcher.In addition, Kersey creates a lot of giant mousetrap-like contraptions to inflict pain on potential burglars. These consist of spring loaded floorboards designed to smash the faces of anyone entering a window or door. Later models have knives hammered in. Nice to see Kersey's old profession of architecture being used to good effect.Things only appear when needed by the plot and then disappear never to be mentioned again. Some lines of dialogue are poetic gems of badness, worthy of William McGongagil. Too many examples of both to be mentioned here, but you can find many in other reviews.The absurd cast consists of A bald and bitter cop, the main villain Manny Fraker who sports a weird and ridiculous haircut, a thief called the Giggler, and various gang members who look like extras from fame.Add to that awful 80s music, a laughable and unconvincing romance and a ludicrous final urban massacre with a stupendous body count and you have one the great unintentionally funny films ever made and is worth watching in that light.The violent 15 minute climax, in particular, with Kersey strafing the streets with his huge machine gun while his vengeful Latino sidekick feeds in the bullets in, is a joy to behold. As is the final team up between Kersey and the bitter cop walking the street side by side shooting down everyone.There really is too much delight in this film to explore in a short review. It really deserves a scene by scene examination.Watch for yourself.As a serious film, 0/10 but as a comedy 7/10.

The script is forwarded by a series of non-sequiturs and jumps in logic, the plot is generic and by the numbers and the direction is get-the-job-done. Fast and tight but largely unimaginative. DW3 however stands and falls with the iconic character of Paul Kersey and the badassitude he's capable of inflicting on no-good punks. Charlie Bronson for the most part sleepwalks his way through it but give him a magnum hand-cannon and he's as good a badass as there ever was, then and now.One might find the first hour bland but stick with it, for the final thirty minutes are a literal blast. The movie becomes so far removed from reality and so fully embraces the comic-book sensibilies at its heart that everything that transpired up to that point is forgiven and even makes sense as a means of easing the viewer in. See Charlie Bronson coldcocking a colourful assortment of badly dressed thugs by the dozens in broad daylight using a WWII machine-gun and I dare you not to revel in the white-hot, blistering chaos of it all. Squarejohn residents, fed up by the local gang, take up arms along with Bronson and all hell breaks loose.Hoodlums throw grenades through windows, old men are set on fire, ordinary women fire double-barreled shotguns at punks, cops run through the streets shooting at thugs perched on windows and rooftops who fire back using semi-automatics, this is the universe DW3 takes place in. Eighties cheese (complete with eye-of-the-tiger-ish synth score) meets Bosnia Herzegovina. And it's supposed to take place somewhere in East NYC. You know it is an outrageous all-out-war action extravaganza you're watching, when Bronson fires an anti-tank, anti-personnel, armor-piercing rocket launcher inside a living room. Everything leading up to the climax is forgettable but action nuts will get a major kick out of the final thirty minutes.

It had worked for those, especially as the first was a bit rough, feeling a bit like trying to find one's way in the darkness, and the second almost perfected the formula, even if that meant stumbling into a contradictorily attractive sewer. Of course, Death Wish 3 still basically a revenge flick featuring Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey, an oddly charismatic architect turned vigilante taking out hordes of theatrical punks, but Winner expands on the previous films here, bringing in allusions to other genres and films, and giving Death Wish 3 added thematic and emotional dimensions.One of the new dimensions may have been somewhat unintentional, but it's one of my favorite modes, so it worked extremely well for me--an absurdist humor that stems from the context of all three Death Wish films as a continual story. By this point in the series, Kersey has such incredibly bad luck--it seems that to be or become chummy with him in any way is virtually a death sentence--that it is hilarious. This aspect is amplified by the fact that Bronson deadpans his way through the film. So when he expresses hesitation for a romantic relationship because of past events, and both reassurance and disaster quickly follow, it's as funny as tragic in context of the three films. Winner also incorporates a lot of intentional humor and irony as the film progresses.Winner doesn't caricature his crime-ridden city as much as he did previously, but his gangs, or at least some gang members, still have a bit of Broadway to them. However, it's much easier to take the setting's anarchic state seriously, especially since Death Wish 3 is set in Brooklyn (the East New York section) during the tail end of its worst crime period. There is a bit of the feel and probably an influence from The Warriors (1979) here.The major way that Winner breaks his previous plot template is that this time most of Kersey's Brooklyn neighbors join in the fray. The idea is a lot of fun. It not only gives us a couple handfuls of attractive, new characters to root for, but it gives Death Wish 3 the opportunity to mix its usual mood with elements from both war films and westerns. The Mad Max films (1979 and 1981) also seem to have been an influence, and Aliens (1986) was to expand its plot in a similar way the following year.To make the war-like scope of Death Wish 3 believable, Winner also makes the smart move of putting the head of police, Richard S. Shriker (Ed Lauter), on Kersey's side, after a pleasantly gritty and surprising opening that first has them at loggerheads.Winner was also smart to retain most of Jimmy Page's score for Death Wish 2. That it's the same score isn't at all a minus, as Page primarily composed a series of leitmotifs for characters and moods, so they serve to give Death Wish 3 a more solid continuity from the previous film. The additional music here, which wasn't by Page, isn't nearly as good, which is making me a bit anxious about Death Wish 4, because Page's music was dropped there.For me, this is an odd series to this point because of the continual rise in the series' quality. I still have never watched Death Wish 4 or 5, so it will be interesting to see if the series can continue the trend. There isn't much further up to go.

And yes, this movie has that and more, everything you loved about the 80's action shlock....its here. The movie revolves around Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) and his return to New York City after ten years away from both it and his daunting past. He was a self-styled vigilante who, after the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter, took the law into his own hands. In the previous installment, see Death Wish 2, he had moved to LA to resume a new life with his daughter, however once more he's faced with punks raping and killing his housekeeper, and kidnapping and causing the death of his daughter. This movie takes us back to where it all began, New York. Unfortunately bad dialogue, poor music scoring (by Jimmy Page of Led Zepplin!), and even worse are the unrealistic deaths portrayed (a dummy falling off the roof and even though it hits a car the guy continues to scream!), this movie scores well below the previous two. However, it does manage to entertain, at least if you watch it only once or twice. This movie finds Kersey thrust into a position to help out a detective, Ed Lauter, in cleaning up a neighborhood where gangs run rampant and crime is escalating. Sadly this is also where one of Kersey's best friends from the Korean War was recently killed. So, grudgingly, he accepts the job. What follows is about 80 minutes of some of the funniest action on film. If you're an action aficionado like me, or just a plain movie buff, like me, then you'll love to spend an afternoon watching this movie. Sure, it sucks by today's standard, but then again don't most movies made in that day and age do. But as I said, it deserves a 5, because to me its in between.

Instead of putting up some bars over the window or giving the folks a new gun, he rigs up some board-spring contraption to hit intruders in the face as they enter. My question would have been, What if two of them break in? The other guy might use this board to beat me! Another thought, If the robber loses his two front teeth, will he abandon the robbery or just come in and kick my ass for putting up the springy-board thing in the first place? This movie is so fun to rip apart because it is so easy! In the final war zone scenes of the movie, a group of motorcycle riders meet their end when residents raise a chain up across the road. What if these were good guys on their way home after getting word that somebody was running around with a heavy caliber machine gun shooting up the neighborhood?

Crime has picked up again & is even worse than it was before. Once again he is forced to pick up his gun & aid himself with some heavy artillery when he finds his best friend, an old war veteran, dead in his apartment upon his visit to see him. With the help of a few of the tenants living in the apartment who decide to fight back, Paul sets out to annihilate several gang members who enjoy, rape, robbery & murder & who's sadistic leader has plans for Kersey. DEATH WISH 3 is a pretty entertaining action picture, who's story was really just created in order to do another sequel to the pretty good, but pretty violent DEATH WISH series, which like this film, was directed by the same man MICHAEL WINNER, who still knows his stuff when it comes to handling action pictures. You see unlike the first two, Kersey doesn't go after the punks because they murdered his family (both his wife & daughter bit the big one quiet violently in the first two) now it's his friend & a few of the tenants that were badly raped, beaten or killed that he seeks revenge for, which I guess is an okay reason to make another unnecessary sequel. There's plenty of action to quench the thirst of action buffs & some pretty decent acting by all the actors, especially by the guy who played the leader of the group, what a talented actor he turned out to be & really made his character believable. But like I said above in my review for this movie, the story & characters is nothing new to those who seen the first two, once again we get a none to helpful & none to bright police force. Bad guy villains who are basically the same characters with the same traits, attitudes & likenesses to the villains in the first two, loads of violence & plenty of dead bodies which yes, does include a woman whom Kersey falls in love with (Poor Kersey can't he ever find a lover that won't get shot at & killed by sleazy punks & villains?) but it's reasonably well done for it's type & one fans of the series, fans of action, or fans of Bronson should love. In other words, this movie worked for me.

Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how quickly the punks give up after Fraker is killed. I'm laughing just thinking about it.I also love the death scene of Kersey's girlfriend. He just *walks away* after seeing her get blown up. It's little things like this that make Death Wish 3 such a bad movie. And I'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack.I watched this movie because of Martin Balsam, who I seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever (and who's own getting beaten up by the scum scene is hilarious) and I walked away with a new favorite movie. Thank you, Death Wish 3 for making me laugh so hard.Some other things I forgot to mention 1. The weird sound effect after Kersey says Cash! when buying his used car. Ha! It's so evil sounding. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Did the writers run out of tough guy names? 3. The fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease thug exchange program I need some more guys. And that Mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building. 4. At the end of the movie, after Kersey blows up Fraker is it just me, or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as they're giving up? Just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop signal. I love this movie. Nothing cheers me up like Death Wish 3!

It makes Commando look deep and Cobra look like an candidate for Best Picture. It takes the concept of mindless violence to the perfect limit of stupidity. The characters aren't one dimensional, they're zero dimensional. We care about them (good and bad alike) about as much as the aliens on the old Space Invaders video game. The Good Guys/innocent victims serve mainly to be picked on by a gang of total scumbags, that is, until Bronson shows up. Then the aforementioned scumbags get to serve as targets as Charlie (helped out by some of the victims) mows them down with machine guns, automatic .44 Magnums, rocket launchers, booby traps, and anything else that happens to be handy. The scumbags have no motive or purpose at all, they just go around killing, raping, mugging and looting for the fun of it, and as Charlie exterminates them by the dozens, like roaches, new scumbags just keep popping up to be hosed down in turn. There's no plot, no acting, no moral of ANY kind (unlike the 1st one), Bronson's not avenging a wife or daughter or anyone else, he's just on a one man extermination mission against a bunch of utter and complete human waste products. There's no romantic involvement (a la DW2), no complexity, no distractions of any kind. It's just an hour and a half of pure and utter senseless death and mayhem. In short, this movie scores a perfect bullseye in the stupidity dept.  "},{"Title":"Bronson goes berserk","Date":"19 November 2005","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Charles Bronson reached new heights of fame in 'Death Wish,' the story of a Manhattan architect who hunts down felons after his wife is murdered and daughter is raped. While very much a potboiler of its time, the film tosses around serious issues, including vigilantism and options of the average man in a society filled with crime.The image of Paul Kersey aiming an imaginary gun in Death Wish's epilogue prepared us for a line of sequels that defined Bronson through the 1980s. 'Death Wish II,' co-starring his wife Jill Ireland, hit the screens in 1982 and grossed $5 million its opening week. Then came 1985, when Bronson and director Michael Winner had another go-around in 'Death Wish 3,' a film whose content stands light years apart from the other episodes.By 1985, the public had already been treated to new styles of action film-making. 'Rambo II,' 'Commando,' and 'Invasion U.S.A.' typified this period when a lone warrior stormed through contrived, over-the-top situations. Character development and logic had almost no bearing in these films, with emphasis placed on a hero wiping out as many bad guys as possible. 'Death Wish 3' uses this model, but in a deliciously sarcastic way. Cannon Films regular Don Jacoby, who wrote screenplays for Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce' and 'Invaders from Mars,' created a vigilante send-up that draws from numerous movies of the past.'Death Wish 3' opens with Kersey visiting his army friend Charley (Francis Drake) in the East New York section of Brooklyn. Kersey finds Charley on the brink of death in his apartment, just after he was beaten by forehead-painted goons demanding 'protection' money. The lowlifes are members of a gang run by Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy), who holds the neighborhood's decent citizens prisoner (including Bennett Cross, played by Martin Balsam). The police arrive at nearly the same time as Kersey and arrest him on suspicion of murder. While in holding, Kersey draws the attention of Lieutenant Shriker (Ed Lauter), who was an officer in Manhattan at the time of Kersey's original crusade. The police seem hopeless in dealing with this band of morons, so Shriker offers Kersey a deal to mop the streets clean in exchange for his release.If you're looking for any signs of Death Wish 3's predecessors, you can forget it. Except for loose references here and there, 'Death Wish 3' makes a complete break with the reality of Winner's first film and the semi-reality of his second. Writer Don Jacoby, replaced in the opening credits by a pseudonym ('Michael Edmonds'), drums up a nutty pastiche of apocalyptic films, biker films, police dramas, and actioners that were en vogue for the mid-1980s. Obviously, the writing doesn't compare with Shakespeare - dialogue is kept to a first grader's level ('Chicken's good. I like chicken.') and 'plot' is only used in figurative terms. 'Death Wish 3' is the human embodiment of a video game, with action film-making reduced to its lowest common denominator roll out the scum and let's finish them off.'Death Wish 3' reaches heights of bad taste in its final twenty minutes, when Kersey launches open warfare against Fraker's men and bikers called in as reinforcements (?). The sequence uncorks with Kersey firing a Browning machine gun from Bennett's fire escape while his Latino friend Rodriguez (Joseph Gonzalez) supplies ammo. All hell breaks loose and for some reason, the National Guard isn't asked to quell the violence. The carnage must be seen to be believed, as buildings explode, cars are set on fire, punks fall from rooftops, and many are buffeted by Kersey's .475-caliber magnum.Filmed in East New York and on abandoned hospital grounds in London, 'Death Wish 3' was the last episode directed by Michael Winner, who probably sensed that the franchise was reaching its breaking point and decided to throw in the kitchen sink. This is the worst Death Wish sequel in terms of acting, direction, and continuity, but the film may actually rank as one of history's great satires, incredible as it may sound. The film defines brainlessness and insanity with capital letters, which helps to make 'Death Wish 3' the laugh-triggering romp that it is.Charles Bronson tore the film apart in later interviews and broke off his relationship with Winner; that should provide a good sense of the enjoyment Bronson had while shooting 'Death Wish 3.' Bronson was unhappy with the script from when production began, was suffering from a cold while in London, and was far more concerned about the health of Jill Ireland, who was diagnosed with cancer at the time. Still, Bronson's rugged demeanor keeps the film in gear and you couldn't imagine anyone else filling the role of Paul Kersey. The supporting roles of Lauter, O'Herlihy, Balsam, and Deborah Raffin (as Kersey's ill-fated lover) offer nothing to work with, but their actors are recognizable names who supply the film with grounding.Although 'Death Wish 3' is comical, Winner keeps to the photography that gave his first two episodes a somber look; cinematographer John Stanier ('Oxford Blues,' 'Rambo III') supplies plenty of the zooms and odd angles that typify Winner's quirky style. The effective soundtrack is a rehash of Jimmy Page's themes in 'Death Wish II,' with composer Mike Moran arranging his cues for synthesizers and a string orchestra. Efforts were made to design London sets after East New York, but I can easily say that the London architecture and organization of its streets are too obvious.'Death Wish 3' is nowhere close to being a good movie, but the seeds are sown for its cult following. Anyone with a poor stomach or who winces at the idea of Rambo is advised to steer clear. If you are a fan of Bronson or exploitation cinema, this is a film you shouldn't miss.-Turkey- (0 stars out of 4)&#133;LOL "},{"Title":"What about the cops! do they do anything?

Paul is arrested by the police for Charly's murder because he had a handgun on him, even though Charly was beaten not shot to death, and thrown into a lock-up at the local police 74th precinct. Paul is later attacked by both the prisoners, for standing up to them, and the Police Chief Richard Shriker,Ed Lauter, for giving him lip. Released because of the hard work done for Paul by civil rights attorney Kathryan Davis, Deborah Raffin, with Chief Shriker then planing to use him, clandestinely, against the local neighborhood thugs. Paul then goes back to East New York to see what he can do to help those friends of Charly still living and having to put up with the record crime rate there. By the time that the movie is over there won't one one street gang member left standing and making trouble for the people of that ravaged locality. In the most ferocious and explosive Death Wish movie of them all Paul Kersey, who for some reason calls himself Paul Kimble in this film, takes on an entire army of New York street gangs in the burnt-out and devastated battleground of East New York with an arsenal that has just about everything, short of nuclear weapons. The action in Death Wish 3 is reminiscent of the battle of Stalingrad during the fall and winter of 1942/43 with street-to-street house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting that left the borough of Brooklyn looking in 1985 like the city of Berlin did in 1945. With hundreds of street gang member civilians and cops dead and wounded in it's smoldering ruins. The local police who were not up to the job to stop the ravaging street gangs on the loose in the streets of Brooklyn gave Paul the green light, through Chief Shriker, to take on the gang members by himself; That's as long as they, the police, get the credit for Paul's successful combat operations against them. Taking out a number of vicious street gang members notably The Giggler, Kirk Taylor,things turn bad when Paul's lady friend and civil lawyer Kathryan gets killed by gang leader Fraker, Gavan O'Herlihy, and a fellow thug. The two thugs knock Kathryan out and then shove her car into a busy intersection where she was killed in a head-on collision. Paul escapes after he was put into protective custody by Chief Shriker from the re-enforced street gangs after Fraker got hundreds of fellow gansters from all over NYC to join him in his war against the good people of East New York. Back in the Hood Paul inspires, through his heroic actions, the entire neighborhood to rise up and take on the gangs and even, for once, the totally useless police joined in the fight. Increidable final sequence that rivals anything that you'll see in any major war movie made in or out of Hollywood as full-scale war rages on the battered and bloodied streets of Brooklyn. Paul and his friends and neighbors, as well as the cops, take on the massive hoards of New York street gangs with everything from nail-boards to sticks and stones to heavy machine guns and anti-tank and armor piercing rocket launchers.The final confrontation in the movie has head gang leader Fraker at first surviving a barrage of bullets from Paul's .38 police special, by wearing a bullet-proof vest, getting pulverized into smatterings by a blast from Paul's bazooka. The rocket launching bazooka that Paul used to pulverize the startled Faker was a WMD, weapon of mass destruction, powerful enough to take down a giant B52 bomber!Charles Bronson as the big city vigilante Paul Kersey showed again, like he did in his two previous Death Wish films, that when you mess with him and those dear and near to him you've opened the very gates of Hell on yourself.

Bronson is back, the vigilante, behind the trigger. This one sees him return to New York, where all the mayhem began in the original. He's come at the request of a friend. But it appears, he's all too late, after he gets beaten to death by these gang members, the leader, a real ugly scumbag Bronson first clashes with in a jail cell, when he's arrested and charged with his friend's murder. Bronson wins the first match with this guy, propelling him towards these cell bars, where he's head gets stuck between two bars. Is that even possible? After watching this and the violence of his murdered friend, earlier, which was a little sick, I was beginning to see why this flick was initially banned, but I'm glad it wasn't. There is a way out for Bronson here. And this you'll love. The interrogating Lieutenant gives Bronson a ultimatum, as well as a gun and puts him back on the street, a free man, provided he blows all this scum away. Bronson declines the offer, but it only takes him a couple minutes for him to play ball. How crazy is this? It would great to believe in that world where us good citizens could get the go ahead to do this. But back to Bronson who takes up residence in his dead friend's place, which is the gangs turf, where robbery and rape is a daily occurrence. Anyone with half a brain would vacate this place. No one deserves to live in fear. That's what I couldn't understand about this movie. Is pride really worth dying for in some cases? Death wish 3 is unintentionally funny as in Bronson's remarks after he exterminates thugs who try to steal his car, and other instances, some involving a little sick violence that occurs here and there. Scenes of gore are not constant throughout. If you really want sick, check out DeathWish 5, the real stinker of the lot. Unfortunately it reaches desperation stakes in it's resolution climax that has Bronson and some team residents taking down as many of this scum as possible, whether by pistols, rocket blasters, and other fancy hardware, courtesy of his dead vet mate. The surviving ones just resign and call it a day. As if. We also meet Bronson's friend, Mr Wilby who comes in handy to stop those muggers who can really outrun you. And how our main gang leader gets it, is another shocker. Not counting the fifth installment, this is the silliest out of them all, but is a lot of fun and is the funniest Deathwish too. It's actually my favorite, but I wouldn't feel correct saying this is a good movie. It's just a great way to wile away or kill 90 minutes. Sorry about the pun, Charlie.

Kersey agrees & sets out to clean up Charley's neighbourhood & dish out some death wish style justice to his killers...Directed by Michael Winner this was third entry in the Death Wish series which up to Death Wish 3 had all been directed by Winner but he left the series after this one, made by the infamous Cannon Group this has it's admirers but I didn't think it was as much fun as it could have or indeed should have been. Here in the UK a TV channel is running a Death Wish season (how desperate is that?) although for some reason it is starting at Death Wish 3 & going through to Death Wish V The Face of Death (1994) so I won't be able to say how they compare to the original two. Anyway, as a vigilante film most of the clichés are here, a seemingly powerless police force, the helpless victims bullied & brutalised, your typical bad guy's & a no nonsense hero who dishes out some justice. Not that much happens here, Bronson & the main bad guy play off against each other for the majority of the film with me sitting there just thinking why don't one just shoot the other dead? Then there's a silly climax in which a war breaks loose on the New York streets between the bad guy's, the cops & Kersey. There's a very abrupt & unconvincing romance between Kersey & his lawyer & not that much is made of the relationship between Shirker & Kersey. Despite it's faults, or maybe because of them Death Wish 3 is never nothing but entertaining & is fun in a bad sort of way, it's just so bad & funny you can't take your eyes off it. Not a masterpiece but it's good fun if your in the right mood.Unfortunately Winner can't direct action scenes & all the set-pieces are badly shot in a really dull & lethargic way. The violence is quite tame with little in the way of blood or much pay-off for the villains although Bronson gets to play around with some seriously big guns. There's a rape scene although not as graphic as those seen in the previous two. The opening theme music is absolutely terrible, the photography is flat & there's not that much style either. Writer Don Jakoby had his name removed from the credits for some reason although it is still seen on the original promotional trailer.Although set entirely in New York at least of Death Wish 3 was shot in London for some reason. The acting isn't great & Bronson really is very wooden which comes across especially when he's got a romantic bit to act out.Death Wish 3 is entertaining but for all the wrong reasons, it's a laugh if your in the right mood but I really couldn't describe it as a good film.

The first sequel was way more exploitative and sure no masterpiece, but definitely still a highly entertaining film that was not to be missed by any fan of Charles Bronson. After the ultra-violent Death Wish II, the series becomes irrevocably absurd in Death Wish 3. This second sequel, which does not at all bother about realism any more, introduces an arsenal of new, bigger weapons and has the death toll rise to enormous numbers. Even though this third Death Wish film is extremely dumb and not nearly worthy of its predecessors, however, it still promises a very amusing time for my fellow fans of the great late Charles Bronson. This is the last Death Wish film directed by Michael Winner, and he sure is missed in the last two entries to the series.Paul Kersey (Bronson) returns to New York City to meet an old army buddy, who is subsequently murdered by a gang of thugs (It had to be a friend this time, of course - It is not like Kersey still has any surviving family members). This, of course, makes good old Paul get out his guns again, in order to follow his old habit of cleansing bad neighborhoods of thugs, this time of a huge gang of thugs. The film doesn't focus on logic too much. Kersey, who is, by the way, still the nicest guy in the world as long as he is not messed with, doesn't even bother about cleansing the streets in secrecy any more - he just goes out and shoots evildoers in bright daylight (while the neighbors cheerfully watch). The guns grow to the extreme (Kersey even gets a Rocket Launcher via mail-order), and the body count subsequently rises enormously. Also, nobody seems to bother about Paul's vigilante activities any more - on the contrary, a police captain even requests him to take the law in his own hands... Death Wish 3 is an incredibly stupid film, of course. All this film offers is extreme violence and Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey. But for me personally, that's enough for a film to be highly entertaining. The only group of people I would recommend the film to are true Charles Bronson fans (like myself). The two films to follow are simply bad, but this is still bad in a highly entertaining manner. Death Wish 3 is about as dumb as it gets, but hardcore fans of trash and/or Charles Bronson should still have a good time.

It's a ridiculous film -- and it's notable that Death Wish 4 and 5 tried to move away from the comic book violence. But get your friends around, have a few drinks and put this on. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll remember Bronson the way he would have wanted you to -- tough, killing the baddies and not saying much.

As always, the film is high on violence but low on quality. Bronson resumes his role as vigilante Paul Kersey. Having lost his wife in the first film and his retarded daughter in the second, Kersey returns to a tough New York neighbourhood to visit his old buddy. However, upon his arrival Kersey finds his buddy dead, having been beaten senseless by a gang of local thugs. In fact, it isn't long before Kersey realises that the whole neighbourhood is controlled by crooks, thugs and murderers, with the few remaining decent folk too scared to stand up against them. Repulsed by what he sees, Kersey takes arms yet again and proceeds to wipe out the army of scum-bags ruining the neighbourhood. For well over an hour, this film is awful. It's boring, vicious and unjustifiable. However, the final 25 minutes or so is worth tuning in for simply because it contains the most extraordinary street battle you'll ever see. The sequence isn't very good in the traditional sense - it's too implausible, tasteless and reckless for that - but it is remarkable for the level of graphic mayhem it manages to cram into such a short space of time. People are shot, nails are rammed through foreheads, buildings are smashed to pieces, vehicles are wrecked, baseball bats are put to violent use, and one nasty villain is even bazooka-ed into a wall! It's an incredible action sequence for all the wrong reasons, but it does at least make Death Wish III stick in your memory.

One of the shots of the gang all running clearly shows a member to be brandishing a plunger, yes thats right, the big tough man choose a toilet unblocker as his weapon of choice. 2. Over 200 people are killed and there is no remorse felt by either side, Bronson is just murdering people indiscriminantly and is as bad as the gangs in a way...The locals cheering the deaths is something to behold. 3. There are tonnes of continuity errors, my particular fav. being the Jewish couple telling Bronson they live on the ground floor then half hour later the Jewish bloke looking out his window which is at least 5 floors up. 4. They killed the Giggler Oh how I laughed... 5. Parts of the plot seem to go nowhere. For example the Jewish couple lose their gun but then nothing more is said or done about it. 6.

No sooner has the magnificent actor - who could have played Lear at Stratford judging by his performance here - got off the NY coach, than his friend is beaten to death. Instead of killing crooks, he should top himself - everywhere he goes there's a murder.However, he has another mission, and so, as a 1991 video release promised, one which only destruction, death and violence can achieve. What is it with Michael Winner's direction anyway? His camera angles are reasonably well thought-out, but there's always something so rigid, so staid, so blocked-in about the whole thing. Maybe it's the rapid editing by Arnold Crust this time, which makes the unusual angles resemble a badly dubbed 70s porn movie. Or is that the music?Contrivances run thick and fast to build up the story. Arrested overnight, Kersey is placed in a cell with a gang leader who takes the time and trouble to tell him where he lives. Later, an old friend of a friend calls out to him and gives him a Browning machine gun. Mind you, as this is a Kersey that can outrun a Uzi then screen realism isn't exactly the order of the day.The stakes are higher this time around, as Kersey takes on an entire gang rather than one or two individual criminals. As this gang is made up of Bill from Bill and Ted and the rapping ringmaster from Doctor Who then it's not that scary a mob. Particularly as their leader happens to be the campest man in the history of creation. Quite why all fifty of 'em don't rush Kersey at once is beyond me, but instead he's allowed to bump them off practically one by one.The gang is a group of racial stereotypes, but as their victims include full on Jew Eli, and Deanna Troi as Latino Maria, then they're evenly matched. For the only time Kersey drops his cover, becoming quite a social animal with his fellow tower block residents. Each night they seem to regale in his tales of wine, laughter and premeditated murder. The idea of Bronson organising a townsfolk to defend themselves against marauders could be a crafty nod to The Magnificent Seven, but then the phrase intertextual, self-reflexive discourse is not the sort of thing you normally associate with Michael Winner.One thing that is similar is yet another wooden love interest for Kersey. Probably the least successful dynamic in these films, the character's much more suited to the loner mould. And how does he always pull so many women? His charisma? You don't have to be a genius to realise she's only there to get wiped.The budget is relatively high for this one, with huge explosions (and a psychic fire service who arrive the second a fire starts), yet this big is more mentality makes it seem so far-fetched. When Bronson kills not to distorted, eerie music, but to a full-blown action chord, you know this is the movie where Paul Kersey changes from distorted avenger to cartoon superhero.Dramatically, this is probably the best of the series, with some genuinely tense scenes as the odds are against Kersey. But what little ambiguity the series had (and it's little) is now totally non-existent. I did enjoy this one in a trashy sort of way, though, and Winner's misogyny isn't quite as overt as usual. That said, the equation is simple rape victim = there to make a point against men and the mistreatment of women. Topless women there for gratuitous titillation. Combine these two and you have a highly dubious kind of entertainment.One last thing - look out for the Benny Hill-style dummy that drops when Kersey throws Ricco Ross to his death. But despite all this, it's a rare kind of film series that actually gets WORSE when Michael Winner leaves it. Yet that was the case with Death Wish, which plunged yet further into the mire from hereon in...

And, the gang itself is very politically correct. Black and white guys together in the same gang (like that happens). Then in the end, when the leader calls in for back-ups-- this huge entourage of bikers (black & white) comes cruising through New York wreaking havoc. Lighting fires, blowing things up, breaking windows, and such and where's the police? Are we to believe that the cops are totally helpless against this scary group of hooligans?Also, remember Bronson's first victim (he shoots this Latin-looking guy on the street after he steals his camera while eating ice cream) The bad guy's gang gets all p***ed off cause Bronson killed The Giggler.

However, Death Wish 3 was the very interested film. The well-known vigilante, Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend, Charlie but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died, because of Charlie didn't pay the protection to the huge and infamous underground gang leaded by Manny Franker. After some altercation during his time in jail, Kersey learned that Franker, who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the New York City in the hellfire (and also his influence) by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time, everywhere and everyday. Due to the chance given by Insp. Richard Shriker who know his profile well and like him very much. Kersey decided to set the war with Franker and his gang.I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most straightedge and extreme violence action film which I had seen from the past. This movie used the very straightedge way to tell the story. No ponderous story-telling and less unnecessary scenes which was the one merit of the movie. On the next issue, Violence was used pervasively in the film. I believed that many of viewers could like the action scene of Death Wish III because it showed the crude, extreme and blast of action for every minutes of the movie, especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of Manny Franker which I thought that it was the maximum action scene.For about the cast, I think everyone was good and get through their role. Charles Bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like the big old cat, but the great vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very good. His main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this movie was pathetic. She didn't look like the main character. I thought that she was appeared only two or three scene before she was killed by Franker and his follower to make a heat on Paul Kersey. She could have more role to appear.For my comment, the straightedge style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action film fans. Fast-paced with back and Forth style made this movie very interested to watch. Nevertheless, this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help, it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money. Haha! that's like a joke! Although, I liked the plot twist when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey because at first, Shriker looked like the villain very much due to his act to Kersey, but when the movie went to the climax, everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with Kersey.In another case, the ending scene of the movie set back me. It stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy. Franker's gang members looked unbelievable after they found that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out from his town before the police caught him. I thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many Cannon Film's movie, but I dislike it.For the summary, I am OK with Death Wish 3 due to my explanation I typed first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even it had some scene I don't like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence could be the best short description of this movie.

Just as the man dies, the police arrive, and they arrest Paul, believing that he did it. So Paul is then put in jail. However, the head cop makes him a proposition. He can kill as many bad guys in the area as he wants, provided that he report any activity in the area to the police.The third installment of the Death Wish franchise has more action then before. It's more exciting, more tense, and more thrilling than before. However, I don't think that it is better than the first two movies, as this film does have some flaws with it, particularly the writing in a couple of instances. And also, the movie has a much higher body count than the previous movies, with Paul killing about 50 or so, which is definitely higher than the number that he killed in the first two movies. But nevertheless, while not as good as the first two, this third movie has several things going for it, and it's always great to see Bronson take down bad guys.Like I mentioned in this movie, the film has a couple of problems with the script. There's one scene in particular. In this scene, Bronson and his girlfriend are going to have some dinner. She says I hope you like chicken, it's the only thing I know how to make. And then he replies Chicken's good, I like chicken. I don't know about you, but to me, that kind of sounds like the first lesson of Grammar 101. Think about it, Chicken is good, I like chicken. When I saw that scene, I couldn't help but laugh, because it was so lame, yet at the same time, it was funny.And as I said earlier, this movie features more action than the first two films. In this film, Paul brings out big guns and it all leads to a climactic battle in which he singlehandedly kills over 50 people. But you know something, surprisingly, he made it work. Bronson was getting along in years by this point in his career, and I don't exactly know how he did it, but he performed everything in this movie like a master, the way he handled the action sequences, he truly was something. It takes a lot to do something like that, but it takes even more to do it at somebody his age. Very well done Mr. Bronson, very well done.Like the two previous films, the supporting cast manages to do good in their roles. Ed Lauter was good in his role as Richard Shriker, the cop who Kersey finds himself involuntarily recruited under to take down bad guys. Gavan O'Herlihy, who played the main antagonist, Manny Fraker, was quite surprising. There where many instances where he could rather intimidating. There are a few instances where he will nonchalantly shoot and kill people, all while laughing like a hyena. O'Herlihy and Lauter were good in their supporting roles, but as you might have guessed, Bronson once again comes out on top of everybody else.This film was again directed by Michael Winner. It was Winner's last film in The Death Wish series, and it was also the last film that he an Bronson worked on as a team. While not the epic finale to a long collaboration, they manage to go out on a good note. Winner again doesn't give this film the edge that he gave the first film, but at least he still managed to do a good job, and that's all that matters. While I did enjoy this one, out of all of the collaborations that Winner and Bronson did together, I would have to say that the original Death Wish was probably the best one.Is this movie one of the best movies I've seen? Not really, it's far from that distinction, but it's good nevertheless, and it delivers what it promises. Death Wish 3 may not achieve the same level of success as the original, or even the second film for that matter, but it still is an exciting film that will definitely please you if you are a fan of the series, and if you want to see Charles Bronson do what he's best at, then you'll enjoy this.8/10 "},{"Title":"Simply a WHOLE lot of fun!","Date":"12 September 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Provided the viewer goes into this movie knowing it is a bonanza of cheesy acting, corny dialogue, handguns that fire 46 rounds without the need to reload, and bad-guys who can't shoot worth a damn, Death Wish 3 is an enjoyable journey through a mid-1980s environment of urban blight, multi-racial criminal gangs, incompetent police, and helpless civilians who couldn't protect themselves from a larger-than-average bumblebee.

A weird experience for me since I'm a big fan of the previous films and I found myself scratching my head thinking why someone thought that humor could be used in serious topics such as brutal attacks against elderly and women in abandoned neighborhoods. Or worst since when Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson), the vigilante who lost his family in the previous films of the franchise could have some humor inside him. Kersey worked better as his most bittered and bloody-thirst while doing justice with his own hands.Golan-Globus surely ruined the franchise (the second Death Wish is way over-the-top but still in the dark mood it becomes something good to watch). This instance has a poor neighborhood composed of Jewish elderly, Latin and blacks terrorized by marginal types who enter their homes, use of violence and sexual assaults to get money which they call paying for protection. One of the groups' victims is Paul's friend from their Korea War days and the moment he gets there, Kersey is arrested accused of the crime. Lame but understandable. Let's move ahead. While on detention, the former architect turned vigilant is offered a nice proposition by the police chief (Ed Lauter, simply awesome) who knows about Kersey's past killing muggers and rapists Kersey is given the chance to clean the streets and remove the bad guys from view. Obviously this chief is being pressured by the mayor and others about the high levels of criminality, but Kersey can be of help. Unorthodox but acceptable in terms of films. The problem comes when the movie decides to present a bad guy. Kersey always fought groups of thugs, never masterminds or nemesis of some sort. Here, the bad guy is Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) who practically controls the city and even share a jail cell with Kersey and they talk as if they were old buddies from other movie (not really). But of course, it's not only Paul versus Fraker; it's Paul against Fraker's gang members who literally outnumber the old folks who live there and who also will try to help Paul. Here comes another stupidity all the old residents possessed guns but somehow they never used against used them against the invaders (only Paul's friend tried to but end up killed), and an old couple almost got arrested because they owned a gun. The police took their gun - even with the man having a permit - but they cannot see all the robberies, the rapes and the deaths around the building. That's just ridiculous. Death Wish 3 is manageable even with all those problems I mentioned, and besides when Kersey goes in action that movies gets where it needs, proving to be exciting, tense and creating nice scenarios, even though the humor seems completely out of place - except when our hero shoots a mugger and the whole crowd begins to cheer. It's all fine until the movie provides a female companion to Kersey, a prosecutor who wants him to press charges against the police for his outrageous detention. Their affair escalates very quickly and for no good reason. She sees him and she likes him immediately. If only life was like that. I could accept that. But when her character gets killed by the group I could connect with the film anymore. Kept watching but wasn't in it anymore. The amount of absurdity, goofiness and unexplained things was too troubling for me to handle. It's fun to watch but it doesn't have any iota of what is trying to be, or trying to do. And have in mind, this was the first Death Wish to be released after the Bernhard Goetz incident on the subway in 1984, and you have Charles Bronson advising people to not imitate the film, don't become a vigilante BUT the whole movie goes the other way, killing bad guys is fun, get your neighbors, grab your guns and start to kill. Some may wonder but wasn't the original Death Wish about the same thing I just pointed out but without the laughs? No, not at all. Michael Winner's earlier film was a loud cry of the society against criminality and police inefficiency, deeply surrounded by lousy politics not doing their job, and as was current with the 1970's cinema movement many characters simply went mad as hell and couldn't take it anymore. Time to set standards and do justice. And Kersey was very conflicted before turning into a justice warrior instead of the guy filled with Schwarzenegger's like punchlines whenever the writer thinks he ought to do those (After killing two guys robbers stealing his car, he's asked asked what happened and he says he was just giving those guys a message). Disappointing and very low, Death Wish 3 can only be enjoyed for its brainless moments if you are looking exactly for that. Those who seek to find more of the same from the previous films will be dead on the water. We all need laughs but it only works without falling into ridicule if the topics brought on are meant to be funny. Or simply label it as a comedy cause no thriller was found in here. 5/10 "}{"Title":"Death wish 3 Better than the 2nd movie","Date":"18 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Death Wish 3 (1985) 92 minutes 18 - for graphic violence and a sexual scene Plot - Architect/vigilante Paul Kersey arrives back in New York City and is forcibly recruited by a crooked police detective to fight street crime caused by a large gang terrorizing the neighbourhood's.

Off course no one had, no one with a acquired taste for the cinematic arts will ever want to watch Death Wish 3. But i am standing by my statement. Death Wish 3 is the best movie ever made; it is better than citizen Kane; it is better than 10 citizen Kane's together. A movie with a quality like Death Wish 3 will unlikely ever be made again. This was cinema's finest hour. A one and a half hour wild cinematic pleasure ride filled with cartoon like mayhem; a wild ride into the ultimate bizarre, a completely overwhelming dreamlike adventure of violence, rape, revenge, a one and a half hour delve into the depths of a world where we find out that a clockwork orange was not the best film about violence. Death Wish 3 gives us a world where we get mugged or killed the moment we leave the house, a world where we get our throats sliced when we have dinner, a world where all women get constantly raped and a world where only one men single handed kills 574 punks with a wild range of weapons. The end where Bronson stands on a rooftop a machine guns down a leftover punks from the streets is so bizarre and so over the top is has to be seen to be believed. Do not take this movie serious; it is funny, overacted, violent but in a cartoon like way. This is an unreal bizarre world, this is a movie with a statement more clear than any other movie ever made. This movie is the movie that tops all other movies ever made. This movie is the ultimate cinematic master piece. Although Bronson himself hated this movie; I doubt if he was still alive he might have actually come to appreciate this one as his finest movie.

Part 2 capitalised on the success and is seen as a good film too (although how often are sequels ever revered as being better than the first?). Then came part 3 and everyone suddenly hated it.I suppose Death Wish 3 is to parts 1 and 2 like Aliens is to Alien. DW1 and 2 were slow and creepy, building up tension before each of the (surprisingly few) kills. Part 3 just has Kersey mowing down muggers with a machine gun.Okay, so it's kind of lost its social commentary aspect, but it's still a great action film. So what if some of the creeps are kind of stereotypical and a bit dumb. Since when was a street hood a criminal mastermind? Death Wish 3 is probably the most far-fetched of the series (so far - I won't get on to parts 4 and 5), but if you're tired of soft justice for criminals, then you'll be nodding your head to the sound of Kersey's 'Wilby' Magnum going off.

What this movie DOES manage to be is entertaining, fun, and violent--at the same time. The last thirty minutes alone is worth sitting through the filler dialogue and laughable villains who get their kicks from stealing purses and running away (and getting shot in the back), and managing to destroy entire buildings with just a handful of grenades.The bad Lieutenant Richard Shriker (played by Ed Lauter) is a douche; dialogue is clearly filler to give some sort of plot; the main villain's rage-inducing smug face isn't punched enough times.This movie is stupid.

The first two Death Wish movies kept the body count relatively low, mainly because having an aging Charles Bronson fight and kill an entire army of street punks would just be stupid. But then the third one came around and they figured screw it, let's do that anyway. From this part on they're just going for the so-dumb-it's-entertaining feel, and I've got to say they're succeeding. Infinitely more violent and infinitely less shocking than it's predecessors, Death Wish 3 is basically one cartoonish action set piece after the other. The logics of this movie universe also never cease to amaze me. How would a bulletproof vest protect you from a stabbing? How on Earth can you order a missile launcher through mail order (I know it's America, but still)? Why doesn't he bother to use said missile launcher until there's barely anyone left standing, wasn't the entire point of buying it to kill a lot of thugs at once? Do you really need to bring an unarmed guy with you to a battle with hundreds of street punks just so he could carry along your ammo? Why does everyone who gets shot fall in the wrong direction? Do street gangs really have a hotline to order more guys if a battle is going down? I really didn't know they stuck together so well. Death Wish is a ridiculous B-movie, but it's a mighty fine ridiculous B-movie. It's a unique experience, just don't expect anything that made the first two into classics.

Yep.","Date":"27 April 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Death Wish 1 and 2 are truly 70's/80's classics in the truest sense. They were violent, gritty and exploitative. But the message behind them was political and very clear. It opened a can of worms when discussing vigilantism and crime rates. Death Wish 3 casts off any sign of political undertone and goes right for the blood splattering exploitation of a drive inn classic. Quentin Tarantino probably loves Death Wish 3. It is light on the story this time around and it is really just 90% Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) blowing away bad guys one after another. The fortunate thing for Death Wish 3 is that somehow it endears itself to you in the most guilty way. As a red blooded male at least you find yourself wide eyed and your blood pumping watching our favourite vigilante take out ridiculously violent revenge against the most insane and over the top group of thugs yet. The first two films managed to avoid being campy or cheesy but Death Wish 3 definitely crosses that line. The neighbourhood that Kersey finds himself in is the definition of living hell and the thugs that dominate it are ridiculous but it makes it more fun to watch them being blown away.Charles Bronson is the pinnacle bad-ass. He endeared himself to us from the very beginning in his plight for justice and self-peace. He hasn't found either and now he's cornered into cleaning up the worst neighbourhood on the planet. Bronson rumoredly didn't like the script for Death Wish 3 and I think maybe it shows in his very unemotional, stone cold performance. Fortunately, it works because he is often like that. He just doesn't seem himself this time around but he still kills like no ones business and looks cool doing it. Ed Lauter, a great character actor, plays a cop who is tired of doing things the legal way and corners Bronson into doing his dirty work. He isn't a villain per se and he is the one last remnant of the whole political/moral debacle that Death Wish has dealt with. Lauter is good but underused until near the end. Deborah Raffin is an unfortunate addition to the cast, nothing against her. She does a fine job in a very empty and pointless character. They try to force a ridiculous romance into the story that seems out of place and pointless. Its like a story thread that doesn't go anywhere and gets left behind in a hail of bullets. Martin Balsam, Gavan O'Herlihy, Kirk Taylor, and Alex Winter are some of the more noticeable performances either for being campy or for at least driving the story. The addition of a single villain a big-bad if you will is completely different for the series. It shows that film makers trying to turn Death Wish into a mainstream action flick. It isn't a bad move and the villain is decent but sort of underdeveloped. His final death scene though is truly 80's action awesome.Michael Winner returns for his third and last time at the helm of the Death Wish franchise. Honestly, this doesn't even feel like his style and I wonder if someone else took over as it sounds like there was a lot of animosity on the set so much so that Winner and Bronson never worked together again. Sometimes when a film goes through behind the scenes chaos like that it shows in the final product and I think Death Wish 3 is an example of that. However, they are fortunate enough that Bronson and Death Wish are both iconic in their own way and I think Death Wish 3 came out at a good time to be considered an exploitative classic. I certainly didn't hate watching it, but rather I felt disappointment for the direction of a shockingly intelligent series thus far. It had always been exploitative and violent but the purpose, moral ambiguity, and political side has been cast off for sheer balls to the wall violence. Fun and guilty pleasure? Yes for sure.

The 2nd unit must have been drunk getting those. We begin as our aging hero's friend is brutally murdered by a crazed gang just as Bronson is on his way to NY to meet him. Naturally the cops think he killed his friend and off to jail he goes. Once there the captain gives him immunity to go out and kill as many scumbags as possible. And with that simple premise quickly set up, the film delivers one creep after another with a slug blown through them. We also get a half baked love interest that has two close ups of Bronson kissing her, in which his mouth appears to be completely shut and it's just a mustache touching a woman's lip. The guy from the store said this wine is very good. That's his only line beyond a 'yes or no' answers during his date - which appears to last about 2 minutes. Women here are simply plot devices to be killed or raped, not developed characters - which really keep these films from rising above the gutter. But entertaining trash they are.

Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) has supposedly left his vigilante days behind, but we all know that ain't gonna last. He returns to NYC to visit an old friend, only to find the friend about to expire. He's erroneously arrested for the friends' murder, only to be recruited by police detective Richard Shriker (the great character actor Ed Lauter, in the last of the four movies that he did with Bronson) to do the vigilante thing anyway as Shriker's police force can't handle the gang violence problem on their own. Kersey displays some real ingenuity in this one, ordering his extremely impressive arsenal through the mail (a man named Wildey really deserves to take a bow here) and also going to the trouble of setting up booby traps. Director Michael Winner returns to the franchise yet again, also editing under his pseudonym Arnold Crust, and keeps thing delightfully cheesy and silly, very well paced, and action packed. The dialogue is full of some absolute gems (They killed The Giggler, man!; Chicken's good. I like chicken.; What am I gonna do with you, dude?; My shop! My shop!). Things blow up REAL good, and here and there are little trashy details like a potential rape victim flashing her breasts for all of us to see. The supporting cast does what they can, although truth be told, the public defender character played by Deborah Raffin (who'd acted for Winner in The Sentinel (1977)) coming off as a rather weak love interest, and Raffin and Bronson don't really get any chemistry going. Lauter makes up for that with his own high level of awesomeness, even working side by side with Bronson during the climactic action. Martin Balsam is pretty good as an angry resident, and in small parts fans can see the likes of Bill S. Preston, Esquire (a.k.a. actor Alex Winter) as a thug, Marina Sirtis (Troi from 'Star Trek The Next Generation) as a victim, and Ricco Ross (Frost in Aliens) as The Cuban. Kirk Taylor is fairly memorable in the role of creepy gang member The Giggler, who laughs while he runs. Death Wish 3 also proves the adage that often movies like this are only as good as their villains, as actor Gavan O'Herlihy (son of Dan O'Herlihy) leaves a big impression as sneering gang leader Fraker, reverse mohawk and all. The music (once again credited to rock legend Jimmy Page) isn't as effective and experimental as the one for Death Wish II.

Add Ed Lauter, who basically plays Ed Lauter, and that adds to the charm. Roaches be damned! There are too many funny moments to write here, but it's the only reason I watch it to this day. I have to laugh when Jimmy Page's guitar makes an angry sound when the camera pans to Kersey preparing to do battle with the hoods. Watch for the final battle and Paul and the police chief walk down the street(western shoot 'em up style), and mow down all the thugs, even though their outnumbered by about 50 goons.

The police seem powerless or useless to stop the gang of teenagers and young adults who are all clearly deranged or under the brainwashing control of one. Everybody in the neighborhood has guns because they have already been terrorized by the youth. They remind me of the Children of the Corn. Anyway, Kersey returns to avenge his friend Charlie's death. He befriends his neighbor and friend played by the wonderful Martin Balsam. If you look closely enough, you will Star Trek's Marina Sirtis and Bill & Ted's Alex Winter in small roles.

Paul is arrested for the murder, but police chief Richard S. Shriker is like Paul with a badge -- he's a big fan of Paul. Shriker offers a deal Paul can kill all the punks he wants to kill, if he keeps the cops informed about the death count. Shriker releases Paul to go after Fraker. Paul moves into Charley's apartment in a decaying building in the middle of a bombed out gang war zone. The building is populated by a group of elderly tenants who are absolutely terrified by Fraker and his gang. Among the tenants are Charley's friend Bennett, an old watch repairman who keeps a couple of machine guns in his closet. There is also an elderly Jewish couple who live on the first floor. The neighborhood is ruled by Fraker, who wears a reverse Mohawk He keeps his hair on the sides, but shaves down the middle, to make room for a gang symbol in war paint. Paul buys a .475 Wildey Magnum with exploding big-game cartridges, spends an afternoon planting explosive charges in the bullets, and loads up for war against Fraker.This is one of the most coolest, but laughable comedy ever made.

In fact, if it weren't for the graphic violence, it could even be labeled as a slapstick comedy.  I mean, how can you take a movie seriously when the hero (Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey, back in New York City after a brief stint in LA) buys an expensive camera to use as bait for a street gang, tells his buddies I'm now going to get some ice cream...it's a free country, isn't it?, and then slings the camera over his shoulder.  Let's just say the bait worked and violent action results.  And how can you forget Paul Kersey eating dinner with his friendly Jewish neighbors who, despite having thugs jump through their first story window to steal their TV sets, still have time to fuss over stuffed cabbage rolls?  Last and definitely not least, Jimmy Page's musical score--his guitar sounds like an electric violin, and always at the most dramatic moment (the aforementioned ice cream comment is followed by his intense score).   This was a movie I watched repeatedly in college for the laughs.  I am not quite sure whether Charles Bronson was in on the joke (and possibly not, as he made two other Death Wish movies after this, neither as memorable as this one).  In all seriousness, the first Death Wish was basically a western set in New York City, and was a relatively intelligent and thought-provoking crime film.  Death Wish 3, just by having the words Death Wish in its title, is an insult to the integrity of the first movie.  But besides this point, the movie is a howlingly good time.

The whole thing is so mind-bogglingly stupid, all you can do is sit there in stunned disbelief. Paul Kersey, the put-upon protagonist, demonstrates once again what a jinx he is. Having seen his immediate family (and his maid) wiped out in the first two films, he returns to New York City - or, at least, a little-seen area of London mocked up as a hellish inner-city district of the Big Apple - and not only does his old army buddy (fresh from a beating by Bill from BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE) die in his arms, he's also arrested by the local cops on suspicion of killing him. This is a run of bad luck that would even test the patience of Tex Avery's Droopy. Kersey is taken down to the station where he gets roughed up and locked in a communal cell with some hardcore thugs, none of whom are a match for the 65-year-old vigilante. After a quick bit of chatter about the rising crime rates, the Chief decides to spring Kersey (I'm a real fan, he explains helpfully) to do his dirty work for him. And all this happens in the first fifteen minutes! This is a film that doesn't so much stretch credibility as forget about it completely. Kersey returns to the besieged apartment block and finds out first-hand what a hellhole it is. The residents live in fear of thieves, vandals, muggers, robbers and all kinds of human scum under the loose command of a Willem Dafoe lookalike with a kind of reverse mohican, so our erstwhile hero gets to work, setting boobytraps, punching out speed-addled goons and blowing the creeps away. This plods on for about an hour, but Kersey is doing his job too well, stealing the police force's thunder, so he gets locked up again. This lasts about as long as it takes to have a shave, and the scene is set for a pulverising twenty minutes of cartoon carnage with a sky-high body count and some genuinely hilarious deaths, none moreso than the demise of the gang leader. And, this being a Winner film, there is one (unseen) rape and one attempted rape, but thankfully the focus is on pyrotechnic violence, of which there is plenty. It's all entertaining, in a cheesy, no-brainer kind of way, the production values are cheap and cheerful, the script is atrocious and there are more laughs here than in several comedies I could mention. If this film wasn't made under the influence of a blizzard of cocaine, then I fear Winner and company have the shakiest grip on reality this side of Howard Hughes.

He slits an old lady's throat, calls up her husband to relate the news to him and his reason..the guy kicked one of Fraker's guys out of his store! The city streets in this film resemble Beirut for crying out loud and the scene where Kersey walks down blocks firing off rounds from a Browning machine gun like some sort of geriatric Rambo has to be seen to be believed. It's positively surreal. Oh and to see Ed Lauter's police chief, Shrinker, side by side shooting human garbage with Kersey is rather amusing as well. There seems to be a limitless army Fraker had recruited, they just keep coming and coming, dying and dying. Buildings and cars bombed with Molotov cocktails and grenades. Kersey covering a wide area of East New York as he unloads bullets from his Wildey Magnum, quite the crack shot, evading, miraculously, gunfire aimed right at him from the opposition. It's a wild ride and if you are an undemanding action fan who can allow himself to completely align with the absurd plot that unfolds before you, then DEATH WISH III is the ticket. Just a word of warning. This is a Michael Winner film, so the innocent and evil equally suffer. The gorgeous Deborah Raffin is a lawyer who falls for Kersey, a major no-no in DEATH WISH films. Martin Balsam brings some class to this utterly classless film as a neighborhood mechanic for taxi cab parts. I guess the finale covers about 30 minutes of carnage..the city blocks in this film mirror a war zone one might associate with a torn apart Iraq or something. Buildings crumble, women with sack groceries are interrupted rudely and violently, innocent bystanders beaten with chains..it's all eye-popping and bizarre. Most people will consider a film like this an insult to taste and intelligence. For the rest of us, it's jawdroppingly awesome.

Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of West Side Story with a new twist. Not even the recent flick Gangs of New York can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its gentle, romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only the James Bond love-interest scenes would do much better.And, in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey gun packs a big punch and when Kersey kills with it, he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it.And that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader? Well, that is something. Kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weapon....that is way too military for him.

Multiracial gangs dressed like Little Rascals, led by Nosferatu with a backward Mohawk &#150; barber misunderstanding the guy and I'm sure he was killed shortly thereafter. Extortion at will, an elderly thug picking at plaque with the barrel of a .357 and everyone listens to Jimmy Page. This the milieu and here we go &#150; our hero, once Conscientious Objector, now a bold Black Angel of Death arriving just in time. Bronson What about the cops, they do anything? Rodriguez, nice Rican neighbor Yeah, they enforce the parking laws. Nefarious miscreants bust into respectable senior citizens' homes through the fire escape at any given time of day &#150; ex-architect Bronson fortifies apartments in much the same way young Kevin will the family house in Home Alone Marty What're you doing? Bronson Thinning the herd. Culminating in a full-scale uprising bearing startling resemblance to the L.A. riots &#150; brutal beating of a Caucasian male passerby, stoning of police vehicles, looting, pillaging, buildings on fire, flames eight-stories high. One of the best American films of the '70's, the original belongs with Taxi Driver, The Exterminator, and Bad Lieutenant as mad (insane), sad, urban fever-dreams, sharing a same sensibility, one both distinctly New York (paranoia, sense of irony, knowledge of neighborhoods, subway lines, history and general way of city life) and male. Anti-hero myths, Movie movies masquerading as social commentary (unlike, say Norma Rae or Serpico). It can further be categorized, along with Electra Glide in Blue and Easy Rider, as time capsule for The Way We Live Now and Why. Acting (Bronson &#150; less an actor than a presence &#150; attempted a performance, his character subtle and nuanced; something like Clint in Unforgiven, coming at it with all that tough guy, man-of-action baggage and flipping it, making it mortal), score (Herbie Hancock), direction (Brit Michael Winner would pimp the next two sequels, but here his work was sound; unflinching, satiric &#150; a handsome shot of a clean, sunny New York and the camera zooms out to reveal it's a postcard, the picture-perfect tourist facade portrait sitting there in the midst of the cesspool that is the real one), script and locations conjoined to form a solid, satisfying slab of concrete. Plus that killer parting shot, rivaling another '70's New York classic, The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3. By Death Wish 3, we've an invincible automaton, downright psychopathic, dispatching vengeance in a clinical manner with nary a quip &#150; not Bronson's style, baby. Exterminate with extreme dispassion. No conflict or complexities here, the message simple early on, a shot of a cockroach scurrying across the floor, the corrupt police lieutenant on whose side we're supposed to be stomping it with his shoe and saying, Cockroaches &#150; I hate em. Later, he'll smash one against the wall with bare fingers and ask Bronson to cool it for a few &#150; too much heat coming down, y'see &#150; which Bronson will refuse, saying, It's like killing roaches &#150; you have to kill em all, otherwise, what's the point? Bronson now a vigilante by profession, blackmail-hired by aforementioned police lieutenant to take out the trash his men cannot. Tools of trade including a Wildey Magnum (bullets the size of your middle finger) and a couple heavy-duty vintage machine guns need two strong arms to hold. Plus a missile launcher. One long commercial for the NRA, by the film's climax, all formerly terrorized residents will have procured guns &#150; some pried from the clutching hands of dying thugs they themselves have killed &#150; and used them without trepidation, running rampant through rioting streets, shooting indiscriminately at minority youths, ostensibly taking back the night. Page's nervy, wall-to-wall score (lifted from part two) lending the only edge to a cynical venture. Yet, there is also something to be said for cold simplicity. Produced today, you can be sure them three seconds it takes Bronson to load would be drummed into its own action sequence &#150; two-thousand cuts deep, shot from every angle and with a glossy sheen so beautiful you'd want to eat or screw it. Each punk shot receiving his own thunderous movement, jacked up camera in constant motion, low-angle tracking shots, triple-extreme hand-held close-ups cascading into a climax with said punk's towering body and Bronson's ejected cartridge inter cut as they descend to the ground, bouncing twice before lying still, crashing music score quelled to silence, followed quickly by a throwaway quip, bring us all back from melodrama. Bruckheimer bombast, sound and fury signifying Peckinpah spitting out his cigar and rolling in his grave. All the carnage occurs here, it's the women who suffer most; Rodriguez' wife, for example, despite having zero lines, will be kidnapped, beaten, gang-raped and murdered, making it personal for our once cheery, now devastated token Rican (who weeps in his sombreros-ridden apartment &#150; no joke). Females are victims only, occasionally used as pawn &#150; you're a hoodlum and an old guy threatens your rep, your very manhood, you rape his lady, maybe punch her in the face, blow up his car while she's passed out in it. Thus the message of Death Wish 3 (Screw complicated Roman numerals, said marketing) is simpler, even more Republican-American than an eye for an eye/ stomp all minorities and liberals. Said message I am here to make money, and exploiting your basest fears and fantasies is how I'll do it. At one point, Bronson chidingly asks fellow Korean war vet Marty, This is America, isn't it? while concealing the massive Magnum behind his back. Marty's look is troubled, but in case there be cast doubt, the American flag hung (droopily) in the corner of Bronson's bunker confirms it.

This entry in the long-running Death Wish series easily brings up the tail end, and commits the unforgivable action-movie sin of being a complete and total BORE. Michael Winner (who directed the previous two entries) and Charles Bronson (again reprising his role as architect Paul Kersey) are the names that technically defined this type of movie, but this time out there's an ominously present apathy and indifference that bleeds through the screen and into your brain. Death Wish 3 plays like 5 crumpled, coffee-stained pages of script ideas somehow inflated to a feature-length film, and it shows from the underdeveloped, unnecessary, and absurdly contrived romantic subplot to the faint supporting cast to the final reel, in which Bronson mows down a seemingly endless parade of scum (bodies are propelled backward by gunfire; stuntmen fall off roofs), it's as if everyone sighed and said I give up! before the cameras even started rolling. In any case, this comes across quite disturbingly in Bronson, who can manage expression behind his steely trademark look, but here seems weary of the whole venture, draining the joy out of his rampage (this also isn't helped by his unconvincing motivation for it); the idea of Kersey mobilizing the harassed residents of a crumbling tenement doesn't help lift the gloom, and comes across as idiotically as a man in a green half-shirt. Additionally, the film contains gaping lapses in logic that are present only to accommodate the plodding pace--if, for example, friendly neighborhood clock repairman Martin Balsam has functional WWII artillery in his apartment, why the hell does he wait until Kersey comes along to use it? This question, like many others in Death Wish 3, will elicit a resounding WHO CARES? from those who make it that far...

It turns out that the neighborhood has been taken over by a gang of ruthless murdering thugs so to protect the building his friend lived in Kersey straps the guns back on and prepares for battle.DEATH WISH 3 has become one of the biggest cult action films of the decade and it's very easy to see why because you're not going to find a more over-the-top or insane picture. The final twenty or so minutes of this picture contains some of the wackiest and most outrageous action scenes that you'll ever witness so it's easy to watch them while drinking a beer and cheering along.What's always been so shocking to me about this series is how drastically different the films are from one another. The first film was a very dark and disturbing picture that asked political and social questions about killing. The second picture was a downright cheap exploitation movie. This third film seems like an out of control video game where Bronson is just given a wide range of weapons and we see him use them against some of the craziest group of villains that you'll ever see.DEATH WISH 3 is certainly a very weird movie but it's also a very entertaining one. Again, the main reason to watch this film is just to see Bronson back in action. I know he said in several interviews that he hated this picture but it really does look as if he's having fun. He's given some creative ways to kill people and there's even some humor thrown in from various traps that he sets up. Again, the real highlight comes in the final action sequence where an entire town gets blown up. This final sequence ranks as one of the wildest in cinema history.As I said, I think Bronson is in fine form here but we also get nice supporting performances from Martin Balsam, Ed Lauter, Deborah Raffin and Gavan O'Herlihy. Michael Winner does a good job at not taking anything too serious and he certainly manages to deliver a fast and loose picture.

Charles Bronson is back as Paul Kersey, creaking into action when his friend is murdered. The crime rate has risen in the area thanks to a gang terrorising the neighbourhood, you see, and there's only one solution send in Kersey's loose cannon vigilante to exact bloodthirsty revenge, or, as the makers of this movie would have it, justice; this time Kersey is the personal killing machine of the police chief.Director Michael Winner and writer Don Jakoby bend over backwards to make Kersey a hero whose actions are justified and condoned the useless cops enter the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection, and in one scene Kersey's response to his camera being stolen is to shoot the thief in the back, to applause from onlookers. This is the alternate dimension in which the movie operates. To the film's characters this is the ideal solution, and the intellectually dishonest way they cheer Kersey on and back him up is insulting. The film doesn't want its audience to have opinions about Kersey's actions unless they're positive, it wants to tell us what to think.Oddly, the beleaguered residents don't fear reprisals from the gang or blame Kersey for any of the violence, which is strange as one character is killed precisely because of his involvement. At the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and join in with the massacre, never stopping to think about the consequences or the emotional toll of taking a life, which might have been interesting. I get that it's all a revenge fantasy, but does the damn thing have to be so cheap and nasty and uninterested in believable human reactions and the issues it pretends it isn't raising?Bronson's shallow performance doesn't help, as he has literally one facial expression throughout and can't put inflection on the right words. New heights of idiocy are reached here &#x96; a machine gun? A rocket launcher?? Well, okay. Worse, the movie reaches new lows of misogyny even for this series the plot contrives to desecrate every female character in sight, whether by rape, explosion or a slashed throat, and sets them up in supremely stupid fashion, like one victim who ventures alone into the crime-ridden, gang-controlled neighbourhood at night to ask out a stranger.

Unbelievable bad luck keeps happening to a simple working man who in turn goes out and just kills a lot of street scum. In the first film (Death Wish) Bronson was someone you really felt for and his situation. And you were cheering him on as he takes to the streets and enforces his own sense of justice. But it is getting old now and the point has been made. Plus the fact in the first film he did all his killing in New York then in the second film he is in LA killing a bunch of bad guys, and then it is back to New York again. This man has a grudge he needs to let go of just like Rambo does. As good of an actor Bronson was in his early days in film I can't believe he really enjoyed doing these sequels.

Well enough shot this seemed tired at the very beginning and just never really got going. I know there's lots of action, people running about getting shot to pieces but this is like watching a fairground ride, not being on it. The two earlier outings were dirty, sleazy little things that nevertheless had you urging the stone faced vigilante on to even more violence and revenge. Here we just seem to be comparing gun sizes. It's laughable and whilst the dialogue is so bad it's as if someone made it up the morning before the shoot. Poor Mr Bronson can't speak one line with any conviction and that may or may not be the writer's fault. Tedious and best avoided if you enjoyed 1 and 2, probably only for those not adult enough for the earlier films.

Is it just me? Or have you noticed that on any evening after the nightly news, you can channel surf and the odds would be that you will find a Charles Bronson movie?  It's the same thing all the time with this guy...the wierdo synthesizer music...(what looks like) the same crummy brown jacket...the 20 minute stretches where he doesn't say a word.  Enough already.I got suckered into watching this dog the way people get suckered into slowing down to look at a traffic accident. I got a perverse thrill at seeing how bad it would get. I am not really familiar with the company that produced this, but in reading some of the other comments, I gather that they have to look skyward to see Castle Films. Production value was nil.Take a London neighborhood that looks like it hasn't seen urban renewal since before the blitz, add some out of date vehicles (were there ever Ford Fairmont Police cars?), throw in some gang members that look like they were on a break from Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' video, sprinkle with 'clever' one-liners, Let half-bake for 2 hours and what do you have? A recipe for disaster.To say that the acting was wooden is an insult to toothpicks. I've seen more depth at an 8th grade play. Continuity takes a holiday as street punks are cut down during early evening (do you know of any stores in a neighborhood like that that stay open past 8pm?), only to be 'discovered' in broad daylight! The gunplay was laughable. Martin Balsam had better luck with weapons in Psycho! Yes Marty, the gun will jam if the shells are loaded backwards.I was surprised to see that is went to theaters instead of video. The riots of outraged movie goers probably beat any action in this film. Hey, I know that it's supposed to be fantasy. I just think that they should work a little harder at it. Not recommended, unless you've already seen the WWF wrestling match that's on.

It was an interesting film to watch,somewhat thought provoking, but it wasn't a thrill a minute, nor a piece of high art. In the second film,lightning does strike twice,and the vigilante returns,this time in Los Angeles. This film was even more violent and sexually explicit than the first,but also a little more action oriented. Any seriousness or credibility the first two films might have been garnered can be thrown into the dung heap with the third installment. Bronson battles a racially diverse gang of motorcyclists, street hoods, and road warrior extras and the film darn near transmutes into a comic book. Hollywood's ugliest leading man kills dozens of young punks, shoots people in the street with impunity, seduces some woman who is far better looking than him (again), and even manages to blow someone away with a rocket launcher. With no insult intended to graphic novelist Frank Miller, this movie reminded me of a Frank Miller comic books, minus quality dialogue. I enjoyed this film because I like explosions, fighting, and Bronson, but this is not a quality film, at least not using traditional criteria.Richard MonroeSee my associated content article Analyzing the Appeal of Death Wish Danger or Diversion.

He arrives only to find out that Brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. Kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond attorney, blows away numerous villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, there's no more point in defending the Death Wish series after seeing part three. The 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and, even though it was pure exploitation, part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first. Number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise. Apparently, Kersey isn't an architect anymore, he's ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody, not even the police, is against vigilante actions anymore? All these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their Death Wish success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series, with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode, armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier, sleazier, meaner and a lot harder to kill. However, the gentlemen didn't seem to realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to Death Wish 3 as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation. This description couldn't be more spot-on, as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next. Particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete orgy of gunfire, explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures. Yi-Haaa! This entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast, including Martin Balsam (Psycho, 12 Angry Men) as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter (Family Plot, The Longest Yard) as the slightly unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.

The first half I witnessed during one sitting, the second half a month or so later. I was unable to handle the entire epic at once.As I sat back and witnessed the mess, I wondered what Charles Bronson must have thought of the finished project. It wasn't his only bad film during his long career. Maybe he had gotten used to making such pictures to the point where they no longer embarrassed him. Ironically, I actual recommend the original Death Wish. No classic, but it was okay. But if you want to see a good film from the last half of Bronson's career, dig-up Hard Times, co-starring James Coburn. Bronson at his best in a legitimately good movie.

One, no mayor of a major city, and New York is certainly as major as it gets. Would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. All of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At 62-years of age, I have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. Even Escape from New York, which was fictional, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn't resort to such deep-seated violence. In this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. Also, in this movie and I have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the Escape movie. Secondly, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be. On the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed. Yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. Outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack Bronson's character? This was not a great movie and I could go on, but I won't.

The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. The plot is something out of an episode of Highway to Heaven and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys.

Kersey agrees & sets out to clean up Charley's neighbourhood & dish out some death wish style justice to his killers...Directed by Michael Winner this was third entry in the Death Wish series which up to Death Wish 3 had all been directed by Winner but he left the series after this one, made by the infamous Cannon Group this has it's admirers but I didn't think it was as much fun as it could have or indeed should have been. Here in the UK a TV channel is running a Death Wish season (how desperate is that?) although for some reason it is starting at Death Wish 3 & going through to Death Wish V The Face of Death (1994) so I won't be able to say how they compare to the original two. Anyway, as a vigilante film most of the clichés are here, a seemingly powerless police force, the helpless victims bullied & brutalised, your typical bad guy's & a no nonsense hero who dishes out some justice. Not that much happens here, Bronson & the main bad guy play off against each other for the majority of the film with me sitting there just thinking why don't one just shoot the other dead? Then there's a silly climax in which a war breaks loose on the New York streets between the bad guy's, the cops & Kersey. There's a very abrupt & unconvincing romance between Kersey & his lawyer & not that much is made of the relationship between Shirker & Kersey. Despite it's faults, or maybe because of them Death Wish 3 is never nothing but entertaining & is fun in a bad sort of way, it's just so bad & funny you can't take your eyes off it. Not a masterpiece but it's good fun if your in the right mood.Unfortunately Winner can't direct action scenes & all the set-pieces are badly shot in a really dull & lethargic way. The violence is quite tame with little in the way of blood or much pay-off for the villains although Bronson gets to play around with some seriously big guns. There's a rape scene although not as graphic as those seen in the previous two. The opening theme music is absolutely terrible, the photography is flat & there's not that much style either. Writer Don Jakoby had his name removed from the credits for some reason although it is still seen on the original promotional trailer.Although set entirely in New York at least of Death Wish 3 was shot in London for some reason. The acting isn't great & Bronson really is very wooden which comes across especially when he's got a romantic bit to act out.Death Wish 3 is entertaining but for all the wrong reasons, it's a laugh if your in the right mood but I really couldn't describe it as a good film.

Bronson is still quite a sight calmly removing a rod from his sport coat and blowing away two sneering car thieves; though when he's forced to chase a mugger down the street, one has to feel a little sorry for him. Bronson was one of the biggest stars of the early 1970s, rivaling even Steve McQueen for box-office favorite, but here he looks beat out, another struggling celebrity paying the bills. Deborah Raffin adds a little class, but Ed Lauter is still doing his police sergeant bit (talk about paying dues).
