Edward Norton's character gives Bob the most grief because he isn't sure if Norton will fly straight.

Robert De Niro, as Nick Wells also was good to watch. De Niro rarely is boring. The third major player here is the even-more famous Marlon Brando, who only is referred to as Max. This certainly isn't one of his more appealing roles but then, how many did he play since the '60s anyway? He - like Norton and De Niro - always grabs your attention regardless of the role, too.Set in Canada, there were great shots of Montreal in this film, and a sharp DVD picture to show off the city.

A narrow escape convinces him that it is time to pack it up and settle down with his casual girlfriend Diane.  However his middleman Max comes to him with a big score worth millions each and begins to try and convince him to do it.  Acting as a downside to the job is Jack Teller, the guy with the insider information who Nick must work with as partners on the job.  Even as trust is built between the three men, little things begin to be revealed that could put the whole job at risk.Very few films are excellent in every regard, some have great plots but low production values where others have multimillion budgets but awful stories.  The Score is rightly sold on it's cast for it as little else to offer an audience other than that.  The plot is overly familiar and, while not bad, certainly doesn't hold any great surprises for anyone who's seen any `one last job' movies before.  The telling is a little slow but holds the attention pretty well, while the job itself is unspectacular but enjoyable.What makes it worth watching over many other similar twisty heist movies is the cast, who manage to make the material seem better by their inclusion.  None of them really have anything special to work with but they all do well and do professional jobs.  Norton is probably the standout of the film as he plays several types of character and is good in them all.  De Niro does a reasonable job without being flashy or looking like he's making too much of an effort.  Brando is OK but now always seems to have a half smile on his face to suggest he isn't taking anything seriously.  I don't understand why Bassett bothered to be involved as her part is very small and doesn't add very much to the film &#150; maybe it was a bigger part in the script?Overall this film is basically nothing new and can be seen in many different forms at video stores world-wide.  The thing that helps lift this a little above the rest is not the plot but the talented cast that have been assembled to run it.  I enjoyed it and think it is worth watching for that.

The object of this particular heist is a 17th Century royal scepter from France that happens to be languishing in the basement of the Montreal customhouse just asking to be taken.  One of the would-be takers is Nick Wells (Robert De Niro), a seasoned heister dreaming of the quiet life of retirement but compelled to do this one last job as a favor to Max (Marlon Brando), an old buddy in hock to some pretty dangerous mob figures. Completing the triangle is Jack Teller (Edward Norton), a brilliant but brash young criminal mastermind whose high-risk temperament is placed in direct counterpoint to Nick's cool, levelheaded demeanor.Perhaps the most amazing triumph for director Frank Oz is his success at pulling together this impressive cast of stellar heavyweights who cut across three generations of movie acting.  Of course, one might wish to see them in roles more demanding of their thespian talents, but we moviegoers will take these three superstars any way we can get them.  And `The Score' is certainly very entertaining on its own terms.  The technical elements involved in the planning of the heist are beautifully detailed from start to finish.  And Oz generates genuinely nail-biting suspense in many sequences involving close quarters and close calls.  In addition, the Montreal setting is novel and fresh and it is enhanced by some very impressive wide screen photography.A film like `The Score' lives or dies based on the intricacy of its plotting and the expertise of its craft.  In both cases, `The Score' excels as an outstanding example of this noble and time-honored genre.  And watching these three acting giants doing their thing in a movie together is OUR well-earned reward.

It's an absolute pleasure from start to finish, just to watch and study these men -- but then, they could probably be taking turns reading the phone book and make it seem  fascinating.

Meanwhile, Nick is figuring out how to bypass the ironclad security system and crack the uncrackable safe. DeNiro doesn't have a lot to do with his character, but what he was given, he runs with. He not only makes you believe the clich√©s, you like them, dammit. Brando is clearly having fun with his role -- one tailor-made just for him. I wrote the part specifically for Brando, said co-writer Kario Salem.

Brando nails it all the way.

The pace quickens, a bunch of conflicts put you on the edge of your seat, and you actually start caring who comes out ahead in the end.Until then, however, this is a very one-sided heist film. It's supposed to be intriguing because of the mechanics of it. You watch as Robert De Niro and Edward Norton (with the occasional prod from an aging Marlon Brando) plan to steal something worth a lot and heavily guarded. Their motivation is just money, and there is at first a trust issue to solve, but eventually it's all about them figuring out the problem.And so you don't really worry about it. I was vaguely curious, of course, because some fancy thinking and timing was involved. But unlike the granddaddy of these kinds of heist films, The Asphalt Jungle, this lacked both the impeccable timing and pace required, but also some convincing characters. Here we have only two. DeNiro is playing himself, basically, and he's good, though he has a girlfriend and a jazz club that makes for nice backdrop but feels patched on. Norton is another story, because he plays young schemer pretending to be mentally disabled. It's disarming and charming.If you can enjoy the first hour or so and watch the slow building up, and enjoy seeing Brando in a role that seems made for him and little extraneous, you'll eventually get to the heist itself, and it gets complicated and interesting. And intense. At last there is conflict. At last the good guys get in on the act, adding tension. And at last the incipient rivalry between the older and younger crook gets going.The director, Frank Oz, is known mostly for being Miss Piggie and doing other puppeteering stuff over the years. But he's been involved in scores of films and done a lot of directing and this feels well made and shows control if not imagination in the way the story is shown to us. It's more the story itself, a committee affair, that holds it back. And the ideas are mostly well-worn ones from other heist movies (cutting the cameras, getting someone on the inside, discovering infrared beams, getting clever about cracking the safe). But if you have some patience, give it a go. There is a treasure in it somewhere.

DeNiro plays Nick, a veteran break-in artist who is forced to do one last score before his plan to fade into blissfully obscure retirement with his clich√©d girlfriend, and who doesn't like the entire set-up from the beginning. Norton plays the characters of Jack (the man who investigated and set-up the heist from the beginning) and Brian (the man who works as a janitor at the building where the priceless scepter is kept, and who pretends to be mentally challenged to avoid drawing attention to himself). You can't help comparing these performances to his similar roles as Aaron and Roy in Primal Fear, which was Norton's second best performance ever, second only to his role as Derek Vineyard in American History X and followed closely by his Jack in Fight Club. Marlon Brando is back to remind the world of what a gigantic, gigantic man he has become. He plays the role of Max, the aging crime lord who has become wealthy and powerful enough so that he can preside over break-ins and take a cut of the final profit without doing any of the actual breaking and entering. The film follows the set-up and the execution of the heist, in which the three men plot to steal a French national treasure, and the plot becomes necessarily thicker as the movie goes on. It is a sign of skillful filmmaking when a two-hour film spends the vast majority of its screen time setting up a heist that we don't see until very late into the film, and it still manages to move along briskly and keep the audience's attention.(spoilers) The heist itself is particularly well done, with several new difficulties coming up even as the heist is in progress (they've already had to deal with the sudden addition of motion detectors and cameras in the basement, after it was finally discovered how valuable that thing is that they found in the leg of the termite-infested piano), including new revelations about the characters themselves. There is a scene where Jack leaves Nick hanging upside down from the ceiling in the basement, and there is really no apparent reason for him to have done this other than to let us know that Nick seems to have some questionable intentions. The heist itself is obviously the most exciting portion of the film, and the tension escalates more and more with every passing minute. First we are on the edge of our seat because Jack is downstairs, turning cameras on and off for Nick, while we know that his janitor friend Danny is waiting for him upstairs, growing increasingly suspicious. Then Danny comes looking for him, and Jack locks him in a basement room, leaving the rest of the night crew to grow suspicious about both of them. The point of no return was passed a long time ago, and it seems at several points that something is going to go horribly wrong and force them to abort the entire thing, but we know that it's too late for them to be able to do that. The film's finale is truly respectable in that it avoids the traditional high action and manipulative shootouts, and we get a great twist involving Jack and Nick.Nick assumingly goes off into the sunset with his girlfriend, who is played by the under-used Angela Bassett, and everyone lives happily ever after except for Jack, now the subject of a massive manhunt, and Max, who presumably gets nothing from the whole deal. We know that this is a focused action film, even if only from the fact that no one in the film has a last name, but it manages to have an interesting and involved plot with several colorful characters, and an ending that is not exactly original but is made to work very well.

He has had a rather ho-hum directing career, but the cast makes him look outstanding. Brando and Bassett are perfect in somewhat limited action (neither has more than 15 to 20 minutes of screentime). Robert De Niro continues to dominate the industry as he has since the mid-1970s and Edward Norton just continues to grow as an actor with each film credit. An excellent film that should be recognized come Oscar season. 5 stars out of 5.

Whichever it is, sometimes it can get really interesting-- to say the least-- especially when it involves a couple of interesting guys; one who just doesn't know enough, while the other violates a cardinal rule he's already learned but chooses to ignore.  And the fact that they've been brought together by a third party who has his own agenda makes it even better, which is what happens in `The Score,' directed by Frank Oz and starring Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando and Angela Bassett.  	Nick Wells (De Niro) owns a jazz club in Montreal; he's a solid, tax-paying everyday citizen.  He's also never met a safe he couldn't crack.  At least in his own territory.  Part of his success is that he's smart-- his extracurricular activities always take him across the border, to either the U.S. or Europe.  At home, he's clean.  And that's his cardinal rule  You live in your own country, but take down scores elsewhere.  It's one of life's lessons that has served him well.	One day, however, his associate, Max Baron (Brando) approaches him with an offer he can't refuse.  It involves the Customs House right in his own backyard, Montreal.  Max, it seems, has an inside guy there, Jackie Teller (Norton), who knows the layout and also knows of a certain item kept in a certain safe that if appropriated could set the three of them up for life.  Or perhaps send them up for life.  And that's the rub.  When does the value of the score finally outweigh the risks?  It's a question Nick has to answer, and quickly, because he's the key to the whole operation and Max is in a hurry.  Jackie can get them in, but Nick's the only one who can open the safe.  So the ball is in his court.  But the risk is huge, and Nick's got a lot at stake-- like everything he's worked his whole life for, as well as the woman he loves, Diane (Angela Bassett), whom he's been keeping in the wings for too long already.  It's a tough decision, but this one more score would set him up for life, and it's practically a sure thing.  And who can pass up a sure thing, even if it is one of the basic lessons life teaches everyone somewhere along the line  There's no such thing as a sure thing, and If it looks too good to be true, it always is.	Working from a clever and exacting screenplay (by Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs and Scott Marshall Smith), director Oz (with some uncredited help from De Niro) sets the stage for the caper nicely, giving you time to get to know the characters and what makes them tick.  From the opening he sets a deliberate pace which works perfectly for this character and dialogue driven story, because it's the people and the decisions they make that gives what they do an impact, and ultimately heightens the tension that builds quickly as the crime is being played out.  Throw in the fact that there's a couple of unexpected twists along the way, and it makes for quite a show.  Of course, having one of the most exciting casts ever to be assembled for a movie didn't hurt Oz's efforts either.  Having three of the greatest actors of their respective generations together in a film, then supplementing them with the beautiful and talented Angela Bassett takes this project to a level for which a category hasn't even been created yet.	With another impeccable performance, De Niro continues to delight and amaze.  He can take a basically regular guy like Nick (okay, he's got some interesting habits, like cracking safes, but other than that he's just another guy) and make him unique and interesting, beginning with the attitude and working his way from the inside out to create a complete character, emotionally and physically.  It's that chameleon quality, that ability to disappear so completely inside the character that sets De Niro apart from just about every other actor you'll ever see.  And, ironically, one of them just happens to be his co-star here.  His name is Brando.	Since he began his career, Marlon Brando has been larger than life and an actor's actor.  He's always been a character actor in leading roles, but now, with age, his ability to create a genuine character, to bring someone to life on the screen, is better than ever.  There's a richness to his portrayal of Max that is totally affecting; he's become the Sydney Greenstreet of the new millennium, and hopefully we'll see a lot more of him in roles like this one.	And proving that he can more than hold his own with the giants of his profession, Edward Norton turns in a credible and totally convincing performance as Jackie.  Of all of the stars of this generation, Norton just may be the heir apparent to his co-stars here.  It's a rare treat to see three actors of this caliber together, and that alone qualifies this film for a footnote in cinematic history.	Angela Bassett makes the most of her limited screen time, meanwhile; her scenes with De Niro really click, and there's some undeniable chemistry between them.  Her part may be fairly small, but it's the relationship between Nick and Diane that enhances the drama of Nick's final decision, and that makes it a big part of `The Score,' and one of the reasons this is one film you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.

The question here is did anyone even remotely connected with 'The Score' remember a guy called Dassin and a movie called 'Rififi'? Or even the original version of 'The Thomas Crown Affair'? Answer no - otherwise this witless effort would never have made it to the screen.Of course, it's already famous in its unique way the first film ever to give a credit to a handbag designer. Lana (who she?) Marks, apparently. Handbag Designer To Angela Bassett. Well, there's something to talk about anyway. That and the fact that whoever green-lighted this dross for production must live in a round glass bowl and eat small dry pellets three times a day.There's no story. There is, however, an unending chain of clich√©s. An old hand at the game teamed up with a young up and comer. An old hand who is going to make it his Last Job. A lady who says I cannot love you unless you pack it all in. Oh, and a twist in the tail (actually, it's less twist time as desperation time, as if everyone has suddenly awoken to the fact that the film has had nothing to say, done nothing to entertain. . . and it's, er, over).What Robert De Niro is doing in something that might once have played as a Made for TV outing - though would hardly make the grade now - is bewildering. Ditto Edward Norton. Yet neither seem aware that they're in service to a script so devoid of meat it wouldn't even upset a vegetarian. And as for Marlon Brando, well. . . As for Marlon Brando. Long ago there was a great actor living within a fine and vital physique. Now there's a mumbling self parody, devoid of grace, wit and dignity. A large black cloud passing overhead might not cast as big a shadow over a movie as Brando does but the effect is the same. Witnessing Welles' peculiar decline was bad. Brando's is well-nigh unwatchable.The plot, such as it is, concerns the theft of 'a priceless sceptre' - well, it would be, wouldn't it? - which has somehow turned up in Montreal (never clearly explained) and which Edward Norton has learned all about (again, never explained). Someone else wants to buy it (er no, never explained, nor how you can put a price on the 'priceless') so cue an exhaustingly lengthy pre-robbery build-up in which nothing happens except you realise how much better Bogart had it in 'Casablanca' (oh, sorry, de Niro is running a jazz club. Well there you go. That's plausible then, for a fulltime safe cracker. Isn't he stiffing enough out of the drinks?)As the narrative sags lower than even Mr Brando's belly, there's a sudden rush to introduce a new dramatic element suspense!! Because it now turns out that Brando has to have De Niro get the sceptre otherwise Brando won't get any money and so won't be able to pay off his debts to a wicked mobster.That this script element was drafted in at the last minute -- though remained just that a draft - is apparent from the investment made in fleshing out the visual elements of Brando's motivational setup. Enter a big Mafia boss played by a major league star? Well, no. OK. How about Brando being tormented by a minor league star (but still a Big Mobster). Sorry, wrong again.Instead, here's $10 for the cost of a scene with two men sitting in a parked car outside Brando's house. And that, er, is that. No expense spent. The heavies don't even get a speaking part. Perhaps they were handbag designers.The saving grace of all this might have been the robbery itself, but it isn't. Norton breaks off from Dustin Hoffman Rain Man impressions to control a computer keyboard - well, there's a crucial scene witnessed in only 50,000 movies before this one - whilst De Niro hangs around like a bat doing Tom Cruise impressions above a safe that's uncrackable but obviously isn't.In fact, it has to be easy to crack because everything else so obviously is in this movie to get the Top Secret unlock codes to the huge and vastly complicated security system protecting the safe, De Niro and Norton have to go as far as. . . meeting a man in a park and buying the information off of him.Excitement? Phew. The sweat will pour off you.(And how did they get to meet the man in the park anyway? Well, guess what. De Niro is in telephone contact with a computer geek who sits in a room surrounded by PCs and does nothing but hack into other people's systems all day long. Original? Gosh. That's only been in 30,000 movies before this one).'The Score', then, is trite and tired from beginning to end, an embarrassing waste of time for all concerned and especially any viewer daft enough to have paid to see it. Linear of construct, it proceeds from A to B and then runs the full emotional gamut to, well, C, stopping off en route to prise free as many clich√©s as possible from as many movie safes it can find in the picture's 26 hour running time (or so it feels like).The music's pretty awful as well composer Howard Shaw evidently fell asleep after the first bridge, so that the score is as bad as every other score chronicled in this film -- monotonous, repetitive, unoriginal. And Frank Oz's direction matches it all the way.Strangely, some of the critics liked it.

The Godfather deal was a walk, not an adventure for him. And since then, an empty husk. It is sad to watch him here.De Niro is a disciple only, not an innovator. He has successfully filled a narrative space a few times, but in the relatively simple case of playing a tough or disturbed guy. He's long over the hill too. Not a matter of burnout in his case, but laziness. De Niro still breaths fire, has good rhythm, but with no magic.Norton is not only of a new generation agewise, but a practitioner of a new method, one which fills the narrative space with irony, not the direct perspective of the other two. More sustainable because he can reflect us into the space. De Niro depends on putting himself in that space, and he is just not an interesting enough man to fill the dozens and dozens of roles he passes through.`Fight Club' understood this new method, literally building it into the narrative. The writer and director of this mess have no clue. Brando discovered this on showing up and refused to participate. Both he and De Niro know what is going on and gracefully give Norton leeway.One sign of a good actor is what he does when the director or writer is so weak. A good one will fill the spaces that the director cannot see with presence that we can. (The best recent example of this in my experience was Gwyneth Paltrow (!) in `Duets,' directed by her Dad.)

The second half of the film is much better than the first.

The reward...a priceless French scepter which is being kept under lock & key at the Montreal Customs House. Jack Teller (Ed Norton) is Max's inside man for the job and has been working at the Customs House as a mentally challenged man who goes by the name of Brian.

The story develops nicely as the film goes on, building up suspense and tension for the main heist scenes.De Niro and Norton are excellent together here, especially when Norton plays his two characters going from Jack to Brian and back again. De Niro plays these parts superbly also (well, he plays any part superbly really) and plays them in such a way that even when his character isn't saying anything, you can see that he's calculating things out instead of just sitting there with a blank look on his face.Overall, this movie is a must watch and if you love heist movies and movies like Ronin, Heat, and Usual Suspects then you will love The Score.

Exposition takes forever this prologue (about 6 minutes, but it is actually stretched over the credits and beyond the 12min mark) only establishes De Niro's character. That is simply unbelievable. Maybe some brilliant filmmaker can come up with ideas to make this kind of exposition interesting, but here it is so pedestrian. We only stop short of following De Niro to the loo. But to me the worst is the overblown character played by Marlon Brando who is introduced right after we know exactly who De Niro is. Brando is hamming it big time, totally on the loose, and De Niro just waits for it to end, knowing he has much more screen-time anyway.By the time you get to meet Edward Norton you already wonder if someone around ever learnt about ellipses. Fortunately Norton does a great job of fleshing up a character that is just landed here to help with the story. In a way we are fortunate they did not start to unwind a couple of back-stories... well, there is the one with Angela Bassett. Seriously, I don't know why this flimsy script was picked up by this bunch of otherwise talented people, but without them it would have gone direct to video.Heist movies are pretty formulaic. The heist itself can take up only 10 to 30 minutes, so creativity lies as much with how you build up things around as with the idea for a somewhat original robbery. Throwing in the mix a seasoned safe-cracker, his agent, his girlfriend and some random wannabe is not enough, it makes it to much look like a version of everyday life.

Nonetheless The Score is still very entertaining, but it's a nothing new story, hiding behind style, and that, to make it look better than it is. We know the story and where it's going, save for that twist at the end, that gives it a bit more merit. This was Brando's last pic, where to be honest, from the physical state of this weathered and wrinkled man, it was almost a silent goodbye signature to a legend. And Norton too helps in the humor department with his little dog and pony show was fun.

On the downside, the actors don't seem that interested in the movie they are playing in.As a Montrealer, my main interest in the movie was seeing how the city that I love and live in was filmed by director Frank Oz. I was impressed. The movie depicts a very accurate portrait of the city and its culture. We are treated to beautiful shots of the Old Port and the downtown skyline. The maps of the city (read at some point by the main characters) make sense. Overall, the film doesn't make any noticeable mistake concerning the look and feel of the city. However, the viewer should note that even though it is the main part of the city that we see throughout The Score, the Old Port is only a small neighbourhood in Montreal. Those brick roads and old buildings don't stretch on dozens of miles! Nonetheless, it makes a lot of sense that a rich American businessman lives there and not in some other parts of the city. Overall, we are far from some other movies that merge shots of Montreal and Quebec City and pretend it's the same place when these cities are about 200 miles apart.On the culture side, characters switch from English to French back an forth, which is very common in some parts of Montreal. De Niro, Norton and Brando speak a very good French, even if they don't do it often. It is nice to hear many side characters speak French. I do have a few gripes. Albert and Jean-Claude are not common names at all among Quebecois men, except those that are ages 50+, so it is kind of weird to see two young waiters in the same bar bear those names. And I don't really understand why two francophone security guards would have a conversation exclusively in English. My guess is that it is to accommodate the majority of the film's audience.I would recommend this movie if you are in the mood for a simple, pure heist movie. There is not much drama nor much character development but one the action kicks off about halfway through the movie, it is pretty entertaining.

If the producers had saved some money on Brando's salary - he is wasted here - and spent it on a writer who explored the characters more thoroughly, a better movie might have emerged.Incidentally, I am not sure the plot ending hangs together. Could Nick really get away so cleanly? Assuming the authorities ultimately catch Jack, won't they cut him a deal where he splits on Nick to reduce his time? How is Nick going to explain where he got the funds to pay off his loans on the flat and club (the only motivation offered in the film for his participation in the heist)? This loose end could have been avoided by letting Nick escape the scene of the crime without leaving evidence of a second thief, thus setting up Jack as the sole suspect.At a deeper character level, will his girlfriend really believe he's given up criminal activity for good this time, seeing as he's just clearly put it above his relationship with her? You can say these are misguided questions about a heist action movie, but my point is that The Score could have been a cut above this.

He has no real persona, he's too Mr Average. Sure, he can't be menacing psychopath in everything but one's gaze on him isn't glued, like it should be. Edward Norton, though is and in a way it's his film.The scenario, set in Montreal, concerns Nick (De Niro) an OK off jazz nightclub owner who has a chequered past and his lady, Angela Bassett, wants him to mend his crooked ways and retire from his dodgy dealings. Nick's business partner, Max (a suitably named Brando) wants Nick to pull one last big one, snatching a rare French antique sceptre holed up in the City's Custom House. On the inside is Max's young prodigy, Jackie (Norton) who fools everyone there that he is retarded and thus gets their acceptance that he is of no threat.Now, there are seemably loads of heist movies and this is just another one of them, unless you're really into such. Unless so, it's just nerdy guys hacking into computers and things going wrong. Then, they meet up and decide to have another go and this time it works, but gets complicated. One of them runs off with the loot, but which one? The end. 'The Score' is much like that except it has a more thoughtful edge and of course the acting keeps it buoyant.Frank Oz, the director, is more usually associated with comedy, including What About Bob, In & Out and Housesitter. The Score is quite a departure for him but is soundly directed and would probably rate as one of his better movies.My score is 6 instead of 7/10, mainly because it's a fairly average film, that's bolstered by heavyweight names that nudge rather than trail-blaze the story through.

As usual DiNiro is menacing without doing anything more than being pro at what he does, Norton is in fine form in what may be his best performance outside of Primal Fear.Frank Oz surprises with his ability to milk the most out the suspense, until the very end we aren't sure exactly what is going to happen.

It pairs Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, who famously play old and young Don Corleone in the Godfather I and II respectively, both roles iconic ones. It's actually the only time the two would ever appear on screen together, and it is Brando's last role. It also features Ed Norton, at the time one of the rising leading men, in sort of a tri-generational meeting of major stars.I'm sure people who don't even like caper films will watch The Score purely because of its cast. And why not? All deliver good performances, even Brando, whose interest in serious acting was often questionable in basically any of his roles after Godfather. It's not Oscar caliber stuff, and not the best any of these guys have done, but when you think about the barely two-dimensional roles the script gives them, they do about as good of a job as you could expect playing them. It's hard to imagine anyone else doing a better job, in other words.de Niro plays Nick, who runs a jazz club and subsidizes his cushy upper crust life by occasionally doing high-end heists for Brando's character Max, a rather clich√© fence borrowing from Sidney Greenstreet's famous work in _The Maltese Falcon_. This movie falls victim to the biggest clich√© of heist movies Nick wants to retire but Max talks him into breaking a few of his rules to return for One More Job. To pull this one off they'll need the help of inside man Jack (Ed Norton) who is posing as a mentally handicapped assistant janitor at the facility where the thingie-to-be-stolen is being guarded.Okay, there is nothing innovative at all about the overall plot. At best it's a hodgepodge of ideas that worked well when we saw them in earlier movies, in some cases 60 years before The Score came out. It is a sleek big-budget production, though, with competent direction, fine acting, eye-pleasing visuals and a nice (lower-case) score, and it can't help but have some redeeming values.The result is a movie that shouldn't fail to entertain fans of heist movies. If you like movies that are all about guys staging elaborate thefts of valuable thingies, this movie is some solid entertainment and belongs in your DVD collection. If the basic idea of a heist movie doesn't do much for you, and you don't want to see the movie just because of the three famous actors, this movie probably isn't even worth renting.

The fun is in watching and appreciating the two masters, DiNiro and Brando, applying their craftsmanship to this film. They make it look so easy to be in front of a camera and become the characters once the director says, action.The young Ed Norton holds his own with these two legends of film and one can sense a star in the making as the movie unfolds.Miss Bassett is a fine actress but we only capture some brief tastes of her abilities in his particular film.The setting and location of Montreal was also a nice touch, giving the film a slightly different feel and flavor that I liked. I sometimes grow weary of movies like this being filmed in big American cities with the  tough urban atmosphere  that we have seen many times before. Filming in Montreal gave the movie a classy and quaint foreign feel to the overall proceedings.Save some of your dollars this summer by not spending it on some mindless and forgettable schlock at your local cinema and rather check out The Score on one of the cable channels or DVD.

Three of my top actors in a movie together? I couldn't resist renting the movie at all, didn't even read what the movie was about. But I hate to say this, I ended up being disappointed. The Score is definitely by no means a bad movie, the acting is decent and the story is something different from every clich√©d heist movies that we've seen with a lot of violence or car chases. This was more of a character study vs. your typical action movie. The main problem though is that it's a bit slow paced, as incredible as these actors are, even they didn't look to interested in this film. They looked tired, which what I was after I saw this movie.Nick Wells is a top of his game heist man, he performs his last heist and barely escapes. When Nick presents his stolen jewelry to Max Baron, his employer and fence, he learns that the money man who was supposed to pay him for it is now deceased. To make matters worse, Max does not have a replacement buyer. What he does have is an inside contact at the customs house where a rare, centuries old scepter is stored that would fetch enough to pay Nick $6 million for stealing it. Nick is ready to retire from the business in part because his flight attendant girlfriend Diane will not move in with him unless he quits his criminal escapades. She makes it clear that she will not be worrying about having to talk to him through a glass partition. Brian is Max's inside contact, who works as a janitor in the customs building. He has the building blueprints, including the underground sewer system, and knows where the scepter is being held. Brian has people overlook him because he assumes the role of a mentally handicapped worker. Because of this the guards and co-workers tend to dismiss his odd behavior, which includes being in certain places where he does not belong. Brian and Nick don't get along and when Nick sends his bodyguard to teach him a lesson, we find that Brian is not the lightweight bozo that he appears.Now I wanted to love this film, I really did, like I said, you see this cast you automatically assume that it's going to equal gold. Sometimes I guess that's not always true, you really do need the script that's well written and the actors really have to embrace the movie as well. I would say that if you want to see The Score, be prepared for more of a drama vs. a typical action heist movie. I think it should have just been trimmed down a bit and Frank Oz, who is a great director when given the right script, I'm not sure if this was a movie that was meant for him to make. The tone felt a little uneven at times; but with the sets, the actors, the over all story, The Score is a mild recommendation for me.6/10 "},{"Title":"Very Well Done with a Superb Cast","Date":"1 May 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Like every other film in the caper genre, The Score has its share of improbable plot elements, verging on the impossible. But, if you enjoy these movies, as I do, you have to avoid examining every moment under a magnifying glass. You must appreciate the film for what it purports to be -- in this case, a daring crime committed by an accomplished thief in difficult and challenging. circumstances. As in all caper movies, the plot is intricate, suspenseful and studded with unexpected twists and turns. In short, it combines every hallmark of the genre. What makes The Score a very absorbing and successful variation on the usual formula is, first of all, the quality of the cast (Robert de Niro, Ed Norton, Angela Bassett and Marlon Brando) and the air of conviction imparted by the director, Frank Oz. Without giving away any plot essentials, De Niro is the experienced burglar, accustomed to working alone and to taking few risks; Brando is the old fence who offers a proposition that will make them both rich (stealing a precious object from the Montreal Customhouse); Ed Norton is the young and daring inside man, casing the joint by working nights in the Customs House as a none-too-bright janitor with Asperberger's Disease or something similar; Bassett is the stunning girlfriend of De Niro's character who will marry him only if he retires from the burglary business. De Niro is De Niro, minus the shtick of his more recent roles; what more needs to be said? Brando, on the hook to a gangland figure for $4 million, displays panache at the start and cowers in fear toward the end. Norton does an amazing job shifting between his two personae -- the stupid, spastic janitor and the clever, athletic thief. As for Bassett, think Beyonce, gorgeous and smart. Frank Oz's direction puts The Score in the company of the best caper films. Enjoy it. Just don't think too hard.

The character (and performance) of Edward Norton was, I thought, particularly good and De Niro gave a solid enough performance but, as the other commentator says, Brando's part could have been played by anyone (or discarded) and Bassett's part would have been better left on the cutting room floor (It's not always necessary to have a sexy love angle).

Not surprisingly, a gifted, powerhouse casting of Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando, and Angela Bassett make The Score both interesting and easy to watch. Oz depicts the crime of safe-cracking in fairly realistic, down-to-earth terms, in his version of the oft-told tale about the professional criminal that wants to quit the rackets and settle down. Nothing in The Score struck me as implausible. Anybody over age thirty who suffers from attention deficit disorder might find it difficult to endure both the quieter, contemplative moments and the deliberate, suspenseful pacing. Not surprisingly, too, Edward Norton excels as a lawbreaker modeled on Kevin Spacey's Keyser Soze character in Bryan Singer's first-rate epic The Usual Suspects. All performances in The Score are above reproach, even Brando's flaky Sidney Greenstreet stock character with his Truman Capote wardrobe. Scenarists Kario Salem of The Fast and the Furious, Lem Dobbs of The Limey, and Scott Marshall Smith of Men of Honor have crafted a derivative but solid nail-biter based on a story by Daniel E. Taylor. Never do they let these thieves off the hook, and they confound their every move in an intricately woven yarn of disasters and double-crosses. The Score reminded me of those classy, high-stakes European crime thrillers from the 1950s, such as Jules Dassin's Rififi (1954), and Topkapi (1964), Giuliano Montaldo's Grand Slam (1968), Henri Verneuil's Any Number Can Play (1963), and The Burglars (1972), Antonio Isasi-Isasmendi's They Came To Rob Las Vegas (1968), Peter Colllinson's The Italian Job (1968), and Michele Lupo's The Master Touch (1974).Sure, Hollywood has pulled off its share of these sagas, such as John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Phil Karlson's Five against the House (1955), and Lewis Milestone's Ocean's Eleven (1959), but they don't compare with these classics. Ironically, The Score qualifies as the flip side of Oz's earlier comedy Bowfinger, but the latter boasts a more upbeat ending. Where Steve Martin struggles to produce a movie around Eddie Murphy's nutty actor in Bowfinger, Robert De Niro must outsmart Edward Norton's devious miscreant during a complex heist. The conflict in The Score boils down to an account about the survival of the fittest. The worse criticism is the writers have visited the well once too often for inspiration.Robert De Niro of Ronin plays Nick Wells, a world-weary professional safecracker who owns a jazz club in Montreal when he isn't pulling jobs out of the country for Max (Marlon Brando of The Island of Dr. Moreau), his longtime friend and fence. Nick has survived over the years because he rarely takes chances. Nick recites a speech that sounds like the speech he gave in Michael Mann's superlative Heat about knowing when to walk away from a job. The opening scene brilliantly demonstrates Nick's imperturbable under pressure in tight spots aplomb. As he is breaking into a safe at a mansion during a late-night party, two young lovers interrupt him. When they cuddle, Nick conceals himself behind a couch. When the girl prefers to smoke a joint before having sex, her boyfriend leaves the darkened room in disgust. Nick grabs the hapless girl from behind when she spots his safecracking tools. He threatens her if she doesn't keep quiet, and then coolly finishes the heist. Once again, Hollywood warns us smoking pot can get you into deep trouble you never imagined. Anyway, Nick gets away without being discovered because he believes in discipline. As he later tells an accomplice, Talent means nothing. Lasting takes discipline. Max delivers the bad news the day afterward, the person they had planned to sell the jewelry to has died. Nick is upset because he had to finance the jewel heist with $20-thousand of his own money. Max calms him down and tells him about a new job.Nick wants to settle down with his flight attendant girlfriend, Diane (the lovely Angela Bassett of Music from the Heart), but she refuses to marry him if he continues his life of crime. Nick and Diane are seriously contemplating marriage when Max offers Nick a job that will pay $4-million. During their opening dialogue sequence, Nick and Diane discuss what sounds like a crime that Diane participated in with a partner who didn't make it back from Istanbul. This plot point is left dangling; making it sound like Diane resembles the Pam Grier stewardess in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown who smuggled in money. As much as he loves Diane, Nick has second thoughts. He wants to wed Diane, but the prospect of a $4-million paycheck and the potential for paying off the mortgage on his club appeals strongly to him. When Nick reveals his illicit plan to Diane, she walks out in a huff. Meanwhile, things grow complicated because Max tells Nick that the job is in Montreal.Despite the obvious loopholes in the script, director Frank Oz gets away with this crime caper for the most part. He generates considerable tension during the logistical planning scenes when Nick searches for a safe entrance into the Customs House from the Montreal sewer system. Oz knows how to induce anxiety, especially when Nick and Jack have to bribe the computer hackers. Dressed from head to toe in commando garb, De Niro's Nick Wells looks like the saboteur plumber from Terry Gilliam's Brazil when he breaks into the Customs House. Moviegoers who like to hear the explosions of uncooked popcorn kernels hitting the floor of a cinema during the taut crime sequence will relish this atmospheric white-knuckler. If you thrive on gratuitous nudity, sex, and violence set to the tune deafening rap music on a soundtrack, The Score is not for you. Jazz lovers will appreciate the cameos Mose Allison and Cassandra Wilson make in Nick's nightclub.

Frank Oz, wise and unpretentious like Yoda himself, is the wizard his name seems to point at. A realistic representation of the activities of an intelligent safe breaker (again unique since Thief) and ***Spoiler follows*** a beautiful lesson in physics Nick (DeNiro) uses Pascal's Principle to open the safe, making water transmit the pressure of the explosion to the door (air would not do this, and that's why the scepter isn't crushed it is separated from the part of the safe filled with water, as you can see when Nick opens its compartments).***End of spoiler***Film heists are not an apology of crime (its usual audience is too clever for that consider Agatha Christie's novels and their success). The perfect robberies of cinema are metaphors of intelligence, and as such they must be realistic, complex and with surprises that, once analyzed, seem unavoidable.

It is said that the two hardest roles to play as an actor are characters of altered mental states, be it drunk, high, or, in this case, a severely retarded individual. The difficulty lies in the ability to not over-act the part. It is too easy to exaggerate the demeanor and physical actions of an intoxicated or mentally handicapped individual (ie, Juliet Lewis' abysmal performance in The Other Sister). Too often, actors rely solely on slow, slurred speech, and fail to master the intricacies of their physical performance. Norton, and a few others (Leonardo DiCaprio as Artie in Whats eating Gilbert Grape, Sean Penn in I am Sam, and a few others) have mastered this complex form.Though the film was rather predictable, and overall not the best, despite the powerhouse abilities of its lead characters, it has its moments.

A young hotshot played by Edward Norton brings him the news of a jewel encrusted ancient medieval scepter from France that is now in the Montreal customs house. Norton is working there as a janitor as part of his undercover act and I have to say his imitation of a retarded man is really something.Brando wants old pro DeNiro running the show, but he has to talk DeNiro into it. DeNiro and Norton grate on each other's nerves, it's a generational thing.After that the film gets into nothing more than what we've seen in a lot of good films from The Asphalt Jungle to Topkapi to The Hot Rock. Of course it's in the hands of some of the best players around.Marlon Brando didn't go out with something as good as the Shootist, but it was far from Cuban Rebel Girl. The Score is also the final of what I call his Christian Brando defense films. That horrific series of events that resulted in the imprisonment of a son and the death of a daughter drained him dry of resources. The films Brando did in the last decade were just to pay the lawyers. He traded in and successfully on the power of his name and talent. What father wouldn't have.

My feeling was it is OK, but with problems. Now I am thinking, it is flawed but well worth watching if you like Heist movies or even if you don't.Hesit films normally involve a group of people stealing something. Why they are doing this is very simplified, they want revenge, justice, the big score or the adventure.The Score is the first heist movie that I have seen that bothers to actually examine why intelligent people would engage in such crimes. This can also be extended to an understanding of why we as humans prefer to fight each other with dire consequences (eg Iraq, or China wanting Taiwan) or rip each other off (all those corporate scum bags know who you are).We have the normal range of suspects...the financier (Played by Marlin Brando) who needs this job done because of his own desperate situation. Here Brando is at his best. The pivotal scene was shot at an incomplete swimming pool within a mansion at Brando's suggestion. De Niro is the super professional criminal who would never take the risk of doing a job in his home town of Montreal. But he takes this job to help out his friend. His dream is to retire with his Jazz Club. Then there is Jack, the young criminal genius who sets up the job, who desires the big score to prove that he is the best.Here we have characters who are different coming together to do this brilliant crime. The journey to the crime is brilliant, but slow and perhaps too tedious. What we are really seeing is the mind of the criminal and it may not really be a mind we like, even if we also see it in ourselves and other people.Perhaps this study of human character is too simple and so ultimately the story falls flat. For me, there was the overwhelming desire to see the task as something that binds people together rather than make us enemies.A movie that will make you think, but enough. Entertain you, but too slow.

Robert de Niro is always good, Edward Norton has become one of my all-time favourite actors and I keep becoming a bigger fan of him every time I see him. He pulls off the fake mentally handicapped role extremely convincingly, and switches back and forth between characters seamlessly. And Marlon Brando is classic.The down sides? The movie started slow. Angela Bassett is completely wasted on a two-dimensional peripheral role as a love interest that really has no business being included in the movie.

I don't know if agent is a good word for it, but he finds work for De Niro in the same way an agent finds work for actors or athletes.The first reaction I had before anything was, wow, look at this cast. We have arguably the best actor ever, Marlon Brando, who I thought really wasn't into making movies anymore, in a supporting role!? I have no idea why Marlon Brando would come back after all these years just to play second fiddle to Norton and De Niro. Brando's fine in his part, but it's a small part, and most of the time I was just like, Marlon Brando?! What's he doing there. We have Angela Bassett as a woman who has as much appeal among African-Americans as Denzel Washington for her defining roles in films such as Waiting to Exhale. She's paired up with Robert De Niro here, which produces a big question mark in me as well, especially since the two really have zero chemistry on screen.At the center of the story, Nick (De Niro), are Jack (Norton), are two people who don't really like each other that much but it's a two-person job and they're both good at what they do, so they'll split it three ways (Marlon Brando gets a share, cause he's Marlon Brando). Nick lives in Montreal and this is a kind of an oxymoron, is a nightclub owner in his day job. He's very careful about what he does, he only steals things if there's little risk and he doesn't rob in Montreal cause he lives there, and either he just feels civic pride or he thinks it's too risky, I'm not sure which. As Nick tells Jack once, he's survived so long because he's just careful.On the other hand, Jack is just a lot more enthusiastic in general, about stealing this jewel, maybe cause he doesn't have a day job to look foward to, and wants to take risks all over the place. In order to tap into the security network, he works at the site under the cover of a retarded cleaning assistant, Danny. Personally, I think Danny's coworkers talked down to him too much, even taking into account his mental state, so I enjoyed watching Jack screw his janitor superior over in one scene.De Niro and Norton really play their characters to type here. Jack is like Norton who has played the edgey bad guy in a few movies, and is pretty overconfident in himself. Nick is a guy like De Niro who has  been in a million critically acclaimed movies as a tough guy, so he doesn't make a big deal out of this anymore. Of course, De Niro is a better actor then Norton, at least in my opinion, and as a parrallel in the movie, he can put half the effort and do his job as well as Nick.From Nick's point of view, there's just not a lot of drama in this job, for him, it's pretty routine and easy, and Jack, as I said before makes a big deal out of this job. I think the movie intended for me to be as excited about the movie and engaged in the plot as Jack was about the jewel heist, but I think I felt a little more like Nick. The movie's plot didn't get me that worked up, I was never really that glued to my seat by what would happen next, even if it had a few cool plot turns.

Marlon Brando is helpless with the trite role assigned to him. Though De Niro plays the lead role in this flick, even his performance is limited by the action-oriented role, he plays. The starry-cast fails; but the suspense, the gizmos, and of course, Edward Norton save the day.Edward Norton is full of life, zest, and enthusiasm. The dual role played be him, as a retarded housekeeper and as an adept thief, is pretty convincing and smartly enacted. The gadgets seem like con-jobs, but are however, pretty well-done and detailed. The computer-hacking part and the part about stealing the codes regarding the security system are overdone, and seem factitious and fatuous. The hacker-geek with a baneful mother is a lot more baneful than his squalling mother herself. Amidst of the many imperfections in the movie, it builds up steadily and interestingly to a well-written and well-directed climax. More than anything else, it is the climax of the movie, which makes it complete as an entertaining thriller.With the kind of the star-cast it has, the movie is deceptive It doesn't have substance, it doesn't have style, and it lacks maturity. If watched with keeping the brain aside to rest, it is thrilling and entertaining, and can be savored at best. Along with its healthful entertaining value, the score itself, of THE SCORE, by Howard Shore is good music for the ears.7/10               "},{"Title":"A stellar cast is entertaining and enjoyable.","Date":"4 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  A fantastic film with a positive and intriging representation of a Canadian city, which is refreshing in modern Hollywood where the American hero who shoots the bad guy and saves the world is so common.

What ends up happening is an interesting and surprising tale of trust, loyalty, and just about crime in general. As Nick, De Niro adds in more substance then style and he is more concerned with getting deep into the character instead of making him look cool. His performance is a noteworthy one for it combines emotion with brains well. Edward Norton plays Nick's new partner, Max with extreme diversity. He blends in a sort of mystery yet sympathy as Nick seems to order him around quite a bit. In support to these two exceptional leads is Marlon Brando as Max, who does a solid job even though his role is quite minor and Angela B. as Nick's girlfriend, who wants him to quite before pulling of this last job. Nothing is what it seems as bit by bit details come together to unravel certain details about the character. The direction is a bit of a cliche type approach, not really showing colorful images of the city like 2002's The Good Thief did. The script builds things up well, but it ends up going the easy route out and skips over some things. A surprising twist occurs near the end of the movie, but everything ends up feeling a bit too hollow. Sometimes, the story feels a bit cliche of the aging great thief hired to do one last job and a multitude of different twists happen along the way. However, the performances combined with the solid direction end up in an enjoyable movie, it's a bit slow at times and occasionally boring but it builds off well enough to be recommended. 8/10 "}{"Title":"Nicely done","Date":"11 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This movie totally caught me off guard.

The story is kind of lightweight, and could have been much, much better in many ways - but the directing, and the talent on screen manage to carry this 'one last heist' type film.Brando is okay, but we never really get a sense of the pressure he's supposed to be under.  De Niro is set up as a very intelligent safe-cracker / club owner - although with scant explanation or development in either role.  Angela Bassett plays his girlfriend, and is totally under-used.  And Norton is a similarly sketchy character (even though he is magnetic on screen), with no real explanation for his behaviour either.  The heist is, by today's Hollywood standards, incredibly unremarkable, with almost no real tension or build-up..In fact, with all these things under-performing, you may wonder why I liked this film at all.  Sitting here writing this, I'm beginning to wonder myself..  But it's really in the performances.  Even when under-written, De Niro is incredible.  Norton is simply excellent, particularly in his 'undercover' guise.  And the small supporting cast are low-key and just right (with the sad exception of the two horribly over-cliched 'computer nerds').Although an unexceptional film in many ways, it just feels like it was written by an intelligent adult, for intelligent adults (in fact, it feels a little like it was a book, and they may have had to excise large portions and characters to bring it to the screen).  And the 'ah-HA!' moment at the end is neat, which is always a huge plus.I'd say it's worth an hour and a half of your time, just about.

It paces De Niro in the role of Nick, a professional thief who is fast approaching the uncomfortable end of middle age, and hopes to retire with girlfriend Diane (played appallingly by Angela Bassett).But before he can say going straight Nick is approached by buddy Max (Brando) to do 'one last job' with a seven million dollar paycheque to tempt him.

The authorities are holding a priceless french sceptre there and between them the two hatch a plan to snatch it - a plan which becomes progessively more complex, as the once simple job begins to look increasingly dangerous. The heist itself is satisfyingly clever, and certainly the film makes for gripping viewing. The problem is simply that it has been done before and better.

What amounts from an effort involving these three impossibly large acting virtuosos and helmed by a timelessly humorous Hollywood sage is a surprisingly modest picture. The trailers do their best to supe things up and make the movie look cool, but The Score plays out like a rebirth of the classic &#145;caper' flick, featuring characters of limited capacity facing heightened stakes with sad and often humorously fallible dispositions.De Niro portrays a professional thief considering retiring from the business and managing a Montreal jazz club that he formerly used as a front for his activities. When he's tempted into one last score by longtime associate and fence, Max (Brando) he faces a world of diminishing odds and increasing suspicions as the circumstances surrounding the heist continue to change, making its successful completion progressively more difficult.Norton's character cons the security and janitorial staff of Montreal's customs house into believing that he's retarded, scoring a job as a janitor that allows him to case the place. This isn't the first time that the actor has played duel roles in a film, but the retarded bit is unique, giving him a solid and sustainable comedic platform. He plays it through with total authenticity, making his plan seem as plausible as it is humorous. And like virtually all of the understated comedy in The Score, Norton's breed of funny is character derivative, relying more on personality traits and dispositions than punch lines.Initially, The Score moves slowly and predictably enough, but as its subtly humorous tone prevails, underscoring the setup, the character exposition, and the narrative ins and outs, the movie becomes alluring in an unexpected way, hitting you with a refreshing sort of earnest integrity. De Niro gives a solid and subtle performance, adding shades of a world-weary, and trade-veteran's humanity to his character. Brando colors his role with a similar flare, providing a light-hearted comedic spark that warms his scenes and makes you happy to see the man so lively in the August of his career.As the stakes grow, the pace of the film quickens, ending in a climax that has punch due more to the progressive editing than the actual, final revelation. But it is punch that works nonetheless, leaving you with the feeling that you've been had by the guy you were rooting for, and making the movie a subtle, well-crafted and worthwhile experience. Granted, Brando, De Niro and Norton have all seen better roles, but they muster performances that earn The Score big points.

No films have highlighted this fact any other than the first two Godfather films. In the first, Pacino plays son to Brando's Don Corleone, while in the second, de Niro plays the younger Corleone. While Pacino never appeared with Brando again, de Niro gets to be paired with the old master of Method in The Score, a slightly lethargic but exciting heist caper. Imagine, movie buffs, the young and the old Vito Corleone in the same scene! I was excited, of course.In addition to these casts, we have Edward Norton, a hotshot young actor, and since this is a genre film, everybody is more or less just enjoying himself or herself. Of course, I have got to mention this; Brando had problem with the director Frank Oz, and wanted de Niro to direct all his scenes. This news is debatable, and personally I don't care. Scenes with and without Brando worked very well. Heist movies have mostly worked, and I believe The Score should be listed as one of the classics, simply for the last forty minutes when the actual heist takes place. There, remains the problem. It takes time to develop its story, introduce the character and build the suspense. The latter is not realised until the final part and fans of action may be disappointed with it. I sat through the whole thing mainly for its actor. The most amazing thing about this movie is the fact that the plot depends entirely on old worn-out clich√© of heist flicks &#150; the hero retiring, wants out and pulling off the final score. The story is built around it and gave ways to twist and turn. You might have seen some of them, but Frank Oz and the cast manage to keep us from cringing. I cannot take my eyes of Brando and de Niro. Those two guys defined and redefined acting for Hollywood, and probably anywhere else. Both have gone to the extend very few have gone and many have imitated. Here, both are relaxed, and mostly, enjoying themselves. Only of recent, both of them have involved themselves in commercial genre films, considering that in the past, most of what they did were award material. Here, there is no need for Method, just follow the script and everything will fall in place. One must congratulate director Frank Oz for the good build-up towards the climax.As usual, lighten up and enjoy it. You might find plenty of problems during the first half. There is still suspense here and there, but a trifle on the clich√© side. If you are patient, you are in for a big treat. There is plenty of hardware involved, and even if they look a bit fancy, they are, like the characters, very believable. Sooner or later you will understand what is going on. It is simple and doesn't need the audience to crack theirs or other's head. The final scene had me literally on the edge of my seat. It has been a long time since that happened.Again, fans of action need to back off. No explosions, no car chase and no fights. Just plenty of suspense and edge-of-your-seat thrill.

I am not sexist in any way but this movie did not need a woman in it, watch it and you'll know what I mean.  All she did was unnecessarily protract and upset the rhythm of the storyline.

Placing characters at either ends of the frame are a feast for the eyes. The screenplay lacks originality, but not a bad job.

It could have been; it certainly had the acting talent.  The film doesn't have quite enough gripping scenes and isn't consistently great throughout.        However, that all being said, this is one of the top movies of the year thus far (only A.I. is arguably a better picture, but I think The Score is more enjoyable).  Building off of a sufficient but relatively weak opening which establishes De Neiro's character, the film introduces Brando and Bassett who both turn in excellent supporting roles.  Bassett for some reason is getting crucified for her role in this movie, but she plays out her role well.  Film-goers must remember that she is not playing lead here (which she has proven she CAN do), but she is playing a role, and she plays it very nicely.  Brando is entertaining as the big rich guy for lack of a better term; he doesn't steal the show, but helps contribute to it.      That brings us to Norton and De Neiro, who prove in this movie that they are each at the top of their respective generations of actors.  Norton is nothing short of breathtaking to watch as he plays both a mentally challenged janitor and an arrogant young thief.  On par with Norton is De Neiro, turning in a great performance in a role he knows very well - the tough, crafty, fearful veteran who runs the whole affair.  Seeing these two stars interact with each other - whether it be live, over a phone, or over a two-way radio - alone makes this movie worth seeing.

However, this one was close to the so-called victimless crime, because the object was a priceless 17th century coronation staff from France, and being held in the Ontario Customs building. Thus we can watch for two hours and enjoy the planning and execution of the heist, including coping with last-minute changes in the security system.The cast is heavy, probably in payroll too. DeNiro, Brando, Norton, and Angela Bassett as DeNiro's girlfriend. Bassett's was the most disposable part, requiring no special acting skills, it could have been done by any actress between the ages of 30 and 50. Brando's is simply the fence, the excuse to pull off the heist, a man who is in debt and needs this one to survive. DeNiro want's to retire, is very hesitant to pull this one off in his own neighborhood, but the lure of $6Million (Canadian, or American??), the ability to pay off his club, to retire and to marry his girl, are too much for him to refuse.Norton plays the inside guy, a security guard pretending to be differently-abled, who is able to get all necessary details for planning the heist. Norton is the best actor here. He has a style about him, both in physical expressions and delivery of lines, that makes watching him very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the scene where DeNiro's large thug shows up at Norton's, tries to push him around, but Norton turns the tables on him. The character he plays is wise and competent, if a bit cocky. So much that he tries to double-cross DeNiro at the end, and ends up with nothing. DeNiro was better prepared!As often is the case, critic Ebert has the most accurate professional review. Not a great film, but interesting and exciting, especially where thay are planning the caper.

I found this to be a very strange film, as it features both moments of high intensity and moments that are painfully slow. Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, the best safe cracker you could find, but as he's getting older and seeking more stability in his life. Considering retirement, Wells is asked to be part of one last big score, that will have him, and his fence, set for life. Wells reluctantly agrees, before finding out there is a catch, he'll be working with his possible replacement, an arrogant and cocky young man, who could wind up getting them all caught. As far as acting goes, you may never see a better trio of leading men, De Niro, Marlon Brando, and especially Edward Norton were absolutely terrific in their roles. The film however doesn't really take off until the crime actually begins. For over an hour they are in the planning stage, painstakingly going over every detail, and it really is as bad as it sounds, in fact, I almost turned it off, until the wheels were set in motion. From that point, the film really is terrific, with an ending that will leave your jaw on the floor! I was very happy with the last forty minutes of the film, and all three actors were fantastic, but so much of this film moves at a snails pact that I really couldn't give it a higher rating. This is a two hour film, that could have easily been shortened to an hour and a half, without losing any of it's integrity. All the detailed plans and unnecessary back and fourth make the first hour of this film painful, but if you can stick with it, the second hour is certainly worth it. "},{"Title":"The Score is Low.","Date":"29 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" The Score (2001) Dir Frank Oz / Cast Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Angela Bassett, Marlon Brando, Gary Farmer Here is so much potential that manages to score very little in the appeal rate. Here is an action film about possession or level of crime committed by two men who measure each other's capabilities. Opening bares nothing to what follows. It stars Robert De Niro as an intelligent safe cracker given a final assignment from his boss that he doesn't wish to undertake because he doesn't desire to commit a crime in his home town. Edward Norton is faking downs syndrome at a customs house where a scepter is uncovered. He mapped out the inside and needs De Niro to crack the safe. One can be sure that it will not conclude lawfully. Directed by Frank Oz with a standard plot gives way to formula but this is a different project for someone who has made Bowfinger and The Indian in the Cupboard. So much potential is wasted here by talent who are so far above it. De Niro, Norton and Marlon Brando are typecast with Angela Bassett unnecessary as De Niro's girlfriend. Normally having their names on any advertizing poster would be deemed positive, so how unfortunate that they are reduced to such shabby writing. We have seen films like this many times before and we will likely see dozens more with even lesser talent. It has an empty screenplay that never scores. Score 2 / 10 "},{"Title":"Top marks","Date":"24 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" I love this smartly made caper movie. In fact, I think it is one of the best of its kind, and it has a clever ending.Caper films are sometimes pitched too lightly, more comedy than caper, or have too heavy a back-story, but The Score gets the balance just right. Although we have seen many of the elements before, they are put together here in a way that seems quite fresh.Veteran safecracker, Nick Wells (Robert DeNiro), agrees to do one last job for his long-time associate and fence, Max (Marlon Brando). The job involves a complex robbery as well as the need to partner up with Jack Teller (Ed Norton), a young hotshot who Nick doesn't totally trust. However, the job is worth millions and it's a chance to retire and head off with Diane (Angela Bassett), his air hostess girlfriend. The movie winds up with a great robbery sequence and a few unexpected developments.Ed Norton holds his own against the two ex-Don Coleones, but Marlon Brando steals the picture. Although he is in only a few scenes, his fat, stressed out old fence is unlike any other character he ever played.Frank Oz has made some impressive movies including a couple of brilliant comedies &#x96; who can never forget Michael Caine's run-up with the cane to test the feeling in Steve Martin's legs in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.The Score has a sharp script and some amusing dialogue, especially in the character of Steven (Jamie Harrold), Nick's geeky computer expert. Steven has an interesting relationship with his mother. When she asks from the kitchen if he wants some lunch, he screams back affectionately, I'm on the phone bitch! The score of The Score is by Howard Shore. You have to be impressed by this guy's range, which goes from dark scores for Seven and The Game, intimate and atmospheric ones for A Dangerous Mind and Hugo to soaring orchestral opuses for The Lord of the Rings. Twenty years before, somebody like Lalo Schifrin would probably have done the score for this film, and Shore has given it a certain Schiffrin-esque quality with propulsive, jazz influenced themes.The Montreal setting also gives the film a point of difference, but by and large, it's the straightforward telling of the tale plus a crisp script and editing that amps up the pace and tension. "},{"Title":"Three generations of terrific method actors in a tried and true heist film","Date":"21 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" It's so rare to see heavily hyped or fabled dream teams of actors or actresses in films be successful, let alone play out, but the pairing of three generations of incredible method actors Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Marlon Brando in Frank Oz's The Score is something truly noteworthy. For one, you got two different faces of Don Vito Corleone coming together for the first and only time on screen in the same motion picture to deliver roles in which they nestle themselves so comfortably. Then there's Edward Norton, easily the underdog or the unassuming soul up against two indisputable acting greats who still manages to hold his own ground and, in some ways, echo the sentiments of these two veterans in their early days.The Score's relative obscurity in the modern day is baffling because this is a film that is precisely the kind of film that isn't made anymore, and if it is, it's made to further along an actor's career or ubiquity, meaning the exterior quality of the picture generally suffers or the budget is so pathetically low that any hope to witness a shred of realism is a lost cause. This is a tried and true heist film, taking a liberal two hours to really formulate its story, the motivations of its characters, their personalities, and their plans before plunging them into a mission that is essentially a field of landmines waiting to be tripped by the wrong move. Have fun and good luck.Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) is our main character, an aging crook who has made a comfortable living for him and his lover Diane (Angela Bassett) by working for his boss Max (Marlon Brando). Of course, just as Nick's about to hang up his hat and enjoy retirement with Diane, Max contacts him for one last job because no shyster, hit-man, or CIA agent can rest easy without one more job that's impossible to carry out. Max informs Nick of a job that would result in a $4 million payoff for him if he were able to steal a sceptre, a priceless national treasure belonging to France. The sceptre is hidden inside the leg of an antique piano, which was smuggled through Canada into the United States. Eventually, it was discovered and now lies in the heavily secured basement of the Montr√©al Customs House.Nick must work with Jack Teller (Edward Norton), a young, ambitious slickster who has managed to infiltrate the Customs House by pretending to be a mentally disabled janitor named Brian. Nick is furious to learn he is not only working with someone on the job, but someone he has never met prior to this job and someone he's unsure if he can trust. However, Max's increasing debt and forces Nick to continue to take on the job and work with Jack to obtain the beloved sceptre.The Score's relatively basic plot is enough to hook virtually any fan of crime dramas in from the beginning, but the real treat is the narrative craft the trio of writers (Scott Marshall Smith, Daniel E. Taylor, and Kario Salem) have cooked up. Rather than relying on a series of banal subplots, worthless characters, or, worst of all, a convoluted plot that disconnects the viewer just as quickly as it could've grabbed them, the writers work to keep The Score rooted in being precisely what it should be - a heist film with shady characters with self-centered ideologies with the element of deception being so present it disappears quite frequently amidst what appears to be complete honesty amongst the characters.Yet, despite this narrative simplicity, The Score wouldn't be a fraction of what it is without the immense amount of talent here. De Niro, during the time he was starting to exit the crime dramas and the loftier dramatic roles for roles that required a bit less effort and complexity, proves once again why he's hailed as an American great. The mannered sensibilities he conveys for Nick are nothing shy of believable, and just the way in which he speaks reflects a seasoned veteran of the crime field. Brando, in the limited scenes he's in, always finds ways to captive thanks to his soft-spoken aura and his character's ability to persuade. Seeing De Niro and Brando work off of one another, especially in one later scene that takes place in a pool, is a rousing good time.Then there's Norton who, as stated, will inevitably get the short end of the praise-stick with the two veterans commanding the screen. However, Norton gets at least three times as much screen time as Brando here and achieves the greatest goal of all when bearing that kind of pressure; never did I once wish that Brando's character was De Niro's character's sidekick whilst watching the film. Norton stands his ground here, being a smug, dictating soul one minute and a charismatic charmer the next. This duality proves that, even at a young age, Norton knew the kind of character he could play, and the fact that he played alongside two great men without slipping up is something I'm sure even more seasoned actors would have a difficult time doing.Finally, Rob Hahn's gloomy, industrial cinematography works wonders for the film as well, providing the picture with a refined sleekness that breeds corporate ugliness rather quickly. Any film that can work off that in addition to balancing the rich talents of three generations of performers and keep a straight-forward story deserves immense credit in my mind and The Score creates something from very little throughout the course of its runtime.

Overly complex and contrived plot. Only watched this because it has the rare combination of two of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro. (The only time they have starred together in a movie? There is an interesting trivia question. Plus the interesting fact that they have both played Vito Corleone). Also worth watching in that it was the great Marlon Brando's last movie.Brando doesn't have much screen time, but he doesn't disappoint. De Niro is his typical solid self.

It doesn't even have a lot to do with their acting, which is solid from each. De Niro is a more cautious version of his cool, professional persona, Brando is enjoying himself as an easygoing late-career mobster, and Norton handles a character whose quirk involves acting as a mentally challenged individual skillfully, managing to be completely inoffensive and uncannily convincing when the plot calls for it.The conclusion of the film unfolds swiftly, especially when compared to the film's two hour length (I felt that, with respect to the small number of characters and the focused nature of the plot, this could have been reduced to 100, maybe even 90 minutes). Norton's character, impressive due to his skills despite being inexperienced, is perhaps slighted by the screenplay at the end, but I'll leave that up to you.The main characters are fairly well written. This, combined with the faces that we see speaking these lines, make the film interesting, despite being a little long and lacklustre in the suspense department.

The story involves master safe-cracker Nick Wells,(De Niro)decides to retire from a life of crime and focus on running his jazz club. His girlfriend, Diane(Bassett),encourages this decision, promising to fully commit to their relationship if he does indeed go leave the life of crime.However,he is lured into taking one final score by his fence,Max (Brando). The job is to steal a valuable French scepter from the Montr√©al Customs House.Max promises a $6 million playoff to Nick and introduces him to Jack Teller (Norton),an ambitious, albeit foolhardy, thief who has infiltrated the Custom's House and gained access to security systems by pretending to be a high-functioning disabled janitor named Brian. It focuses on the relationship of the four main characters and the events leading up to the theft of the scepter.Although the film has been a familiar storyline for many movies,the performances of De Niro,Norton,Brando and Bassett is what make this film fresh and original.The cinematography should also be given credit as shots from the classic city of Montreal and its exterior locations added beauty to the film.The cast of characters,major and minor,adds color and drama to the story as well.The direction of Oz was also masterful and brilliant as he used patience in unfolding to us the story which added suspense to the crime thriller.Overall,it is one major motion picture that one can truly appreciate.It was Marlon Brando's last film and he will surely be missed by movie fans world-wide.

So why is this more than just another heist movie? Many reasons - the Montreal setting, three quality lead actors from across the generations, the dialogue, the script, the lighting, the direction, Howard Shore's wonderful score etc. This is almost a flawless movie. Having Norton reprise his dual persona trick reminded me constantly of Primal Fear and the bit part computer hacker who was portrayed as a clich√©d geek were for me the only minor negatives.

And - last but not least - there's a bit of totty for the rather inevitable love interest/conflict of desires hokum.And there's a heist that's nicely done in the 'Topkapi', 'Heat', 'Ronin' style as the terse one-word title would suggest. The idea's been dusted-off more times than Auntie Maude's favourite heirloom.But it's all good stuff. It's just hard to be surprised or impressed.

The end product is a more tame affair though, too light and generic a project to really let the cast build up a head of steam.Essentially a heist thriller with a substantial side role that involved Edward Norton acting as a mentally challenged security guard, The Score bears the weight of it's decorated cast in the ponderous feel of the action. Norton is very good as Jack/Brian but distractingly so - his role as Brian is within the film and not it's main draw. De Niro clearly bears more than the weight of his character's misgivings - he's also carrying the slurring Brando through a rather anonymous appearance.Ultimately, Frank Oz does a commendably professional job in putting together something more than coherent but thoroughly serviceable.

Also, after you see the movie for the first time it takes a lot of the thrill out of seeing it again.Brando, De Niro and Norton could make even the worst written and ill conceived movie work.

De Niro and Norton deliver a great performance, the direction is nothing special, but I respect Oz for Bowfinger. It's also one of those movie where the characters are positive for some and negative for other. After all the characters are really interesting and colorful.

Edward Norton does a fine turn as as Deniro's partner in crime, and his ruse as a retarded janitor is more proof of his abilities as one of the best of the Hollywood crowd. Marlon Brando,s role as the initiator is great casting and I was pleased to see him doing such a good turn at careers end.All of the setup scenes leading to the heist were paced in such a way that was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat.

DeNiro has several problems with Norton but comes around and agrees to the job.  I love heist movies and this has everything you want.  You're in on the plan, you get some roadblocks thrown in, and of course their is underlying distrust among the players.  It might sound like Im describing a cookie-cutter story here.

The score of the title is a priceless scepter being stored in a customs house in Montreal. Robert DeNiro plays a professional thief who is looking for that one last score before hanging them up and settling down with the lovely Angela Bassett. Along comes Marlon Brando with just such an opportunity. Into the mix comes the inside man Edward Norton who has convinced Brando to include him in the job. The rest of the plot involves the preparations for the job and of course the score itself. DeNiro and Brando kind of spar with each other. It's too bad that we don't get to see more of them together. Norton takes the acting honors in this one, particularly when assumes the guise of the simple-minded janitor. Angela Bassett is basically wasted here. She is a very fine actress and could have more than held her own against such formidable talent had her part been bigger. This film is also noteworthy in that there is no sex or violence to speak of and no glitzy special effects. The acting carries the film and the direction by Frank Oz keeps things moving along nicely. Imagine the challenge of directing BOTH DeNiro and Brando. The Score, although predictable, is still a very entertaining film. It's great to see Marlon Brando again. It's a pity that he deprived us of his considerable talents for so long.

When I saw how powerful the casting was, I feared for Frank Oz and I feared that it would be the typical flat performances of an under-directed cast. I was DEAD WRONG. Frank Oz did a fantastic job in allowing these great actors plenty of space to do their thing and yet he got some great performances. Basset wasn't quite believable in her role as 'thief's girlfriend' but she had such a minor role that it didn't detract too much. In fact, the big surprise here was Ed Norton. He turned in the most convincing performance of them all! Way to go Gen-X'r!!! I voted this film a 7 primarily because of the Sloooowwww start. not much action and LOTS of Basset scenes made for a weak opening. In fact, even the exchanges between De Niro and Brando were missing something in the beginning. Overall, I definitely feel this was a better film than the recently released, Oceans 11 in that 'Score' offered at least SOME tension which draws you into the crime scene and opens you up to a world that you never knew existed (Oceans 11 offers ZERO tension but is nearly identical in plot to this picture) "}{"Title":"A nicely crafted caper flick","Date":"4 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This is a nicely crafted caper flick with a talented cast and a well conceived story.  The heist genre has been heavily sown over the years, so it is difficult to come up with a truly fresh storyline.  Still, there have been so many bad heist films that to see one of this caliber is a treat. Robert DeNiro plays Nick, a thief who wants to do one big job to get out of the business.  Marlon Brando is Max, the fence who brings Nick together with Jack (Edward Norton), the inside man who conceived the job.  This standard setup is far from original and is a staple of this type of film.  What makes it excel is the way it unfolds.  Director Frank Oz, steps out from his outstanding career with the Muppets to take on a completely different type of project, performing quite admirably.  Oz unwinds the tale deliberately, taking time to develop relationships and motivations usually missing from heist flicks.  The result is an extremely believable yarn with characters whose behavior is consistent with motivations revealed throughout the film.The story, which is a collaborative effort by four writers of little renown, is very tight.  They do a good job of creating a story that evolves effectively, adapting ingeniously to each little wrinkle they introduce.  While the probability of a double cross is pretty transparent, the ending twists a couple of times, first giving the viewer what he has been set up to expect and then delivering the unexpected.  That is good storytelling.The acting is uniformly good from a cast of accomplished actors.  DeNiro doesn't break any new ground with this character, but Nick is so familiar to him that he can't help but deliver a terrific portrayal.  This may not be a career performance for DeNiro, but there are few actors I can think of who could have played this character any better.  Marlon Brando is a legend, of course, but he has not done anything of consequence since `Apocalypse Now' (1979).  Even that was a kind of grotesquely twisted character that came nowhere near some of his great performances starting with `A Streetcar Named Desire' (1951) through `Godfather' (1972).  This is the first film I have seen him in since 1979 that shows a glimmer of his true acting ability.  Though it is a small role, Brando interprets the character with subtle undertones and a raw power that we haven't seen from him in many years.The new kid on the block (by comparison), but no less talented is Edward Norton.  I have been impressed by Norton's audacious style with each new film he has made.  Once again he adds to his range with this film, delivering a fantastic imitation of a palsied man as a cover for his inside work.  However, this is only a footnote to an otherwise powerful performance.  He conjures a seething arrogance and cunning resolve in a character determined to show the old timers how he is really the best and smartest of them all.  This is a fine addition to a growing resume of Norton's exceptional performances.Though Angela Bassett's character is really superfluous, I must give her credit for an excellent job.  Bassett infuses great emotion and sincerity into a character that is little more than a motivational point of reference for Nick's behavior.  Still, she plays every scene flat out, making the most of a limited opportunity.I was very impressed with this film on a number of levels.  I rated it a 9/10 on the strength of how it compares with the genre.  Even taken in a broader context, I would give it a 7/10 or 8/10 because it is such good filmmaking.  Though a bit slow for the action junkie, it is an engaging film with plenty of entertainment value.

Like all really good crime dramas, there are no cops. The scores to be settled are between the bad guys. Plot summary - Nick (Robert DeNiro) is a Montreal jazz club owner, who sides as a high end heist operator. Max (Brando) is a crime boss of some sort who wants Nick to take one last job, with newcomer Jack (Norton), also a heist man. The score is to steal a priceless sceptre from inside the Montreal customs office, a seemingly uncrackable building. Jack is working as a janitor inside, posing as a mentally handicapped man that everyone likes.The problem - how do they work through the guards, the security codes, the maze of tunnels below the building and everyone's genuine mistrust for eachother to pull this off. Deniro is his usual reliable self. He has played a bad guy so many times so competently, that I am beginning to believe that he is a career criminal rather than a Oscar Winning actor. Edward Norton has emerged as one of , if my, my favourite actor of the new generation. He somewhat reprises his role from Primal fear, playing a criminal posing as a handicapped individual. Brando and Angela Basset perform well in completely disposable roles - the movie would have gotten along just fine without them.Frank Oz takes a quantum leap from pie-in-the-face comedy and voicing muppets to make a patient, sprawling Michael Mann style heist movie, with a film noir look and feel. In the director's commentary, he mentions trying to invoke the shadowy feel of A Touch of Evil, and not to put the two films in the same league, I think he succeeds.This is not a classic or even a Ten Best of 2001, but a very enjoyable rental, targeted for crime fans. *** out of ****.

As far as I am concerned, the scenes with De Niro steal this movie. One thing I noticed, was the interaction between De Niro and the girl in the room at the beginning of the movie mirrored how Norton treated the old janitor in the utility room. With the exception of course, to having the old man look at him. Norton does an acceptable job but not earthshattering. Maybe they should have offered his role to Johnny Dep?

Not that The Score is a great movie; it's a good movie, entertaining with competent direction, enjoyable dialogue and solid acting.  Some have commented about the slowness of the film and the lackluster performance of DeNiro.  I disagree on both counts. The slow pace was perfectly suited to building up suspense on a psychological level.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is of DeNiro hanging upside down for what seems like an eternity, wrapped in his thief garb and sweating profusely.  He doesn't say a word, but you can see in his eyes that he is thinking I need to pull out.  (I actually wish he had pulled out - that would be an interesting twist on the genre).Marlon Brando playing the flamboyant aging backer was effective and the scene of he and DeNiro in Brando's master bathroom was one of the best moments of the film.  It was in scenes like these where I really felt that DeNiro, however, proved his mettle as a great actor.  He doesn't ever wave his hands or raise his voice.  He just has a way of turning out a phrase and making it come out believable.  Here he is tempted to back out of the plan, but caves into a desperate plea; again I think the film would have taken a more interesting route had he backed out and the story could have gone on from there.Ed Norton is a decent but highly over-rated actor.  I'm not sure why so many were so captivated by his performance in this film; I'm assuming it was his retarded act, but I still don't see what was so wonderful about it.  He plays his role well enough, and nothing more to say about it.  Angela Bassett's character as the token girlfriend was a complete waste and was almost as lame a female character as Julia Roberts' character in Ocean's 11.  I think we need some smart women to make movies in Hollywood, cause the guys are living in 1950.I liked the scene at the park... nice tension.  I didn't like the computer-geek hacker.  He seemed like a character out of Ocean's 11 and totally out-of-place in this more serious film.  If only Ocean's 11 had one or two good characters like this geek, it might have been a tolerable film.That brings me to the inevitable comparison with the other score films (Ocean's 11 and Heist) and why The Score is much better than both of the others.  Heist, like the Score had a core of good veteran actors that keeps your interest.  But it also stars two horribly cast young performers that simply cannot keep up with the likes of Gene Hackman.  David Mamet's dialogue is so self-consciously trying to be cool, but only comes off as corny 90% of the time.  As far as Ocean's 11 is concerned, there's not much to say about that monstrosity.  It is the movie equivalent of a frat party, and like all frat parties, I can't imagine anyone but the members of that frat enjoying it.  What a waste and insult.  Hard to believe that Steven Soderbergh could make a remake of a bad film that's even worse than the original.See The Score and enjoy the ride, but even though you have good performances from greats like DeNiro and Brando, don't expect this to be a classic film.  It follows many conventional formulas of heist movies, it has the requisite twist at the end, and the actual job is full of holes.  But it's entertaining in its convention and done well, and with modest expectations, it delivers. (7/10) "},{"Title":"Caper films are all the same. Or are they?","Date":"19 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  First off most people are commenting on the script as being unoriginal. It is a caper flick folks. Most genres follow a specific plot. Look at most westerns for example. The Score was to me an excellent caper film. Set in Montreal (what a change of pace that is. Guess what country I live in?) DeNiro plays the role of an aging thief willing to take one last job for a big reward at the end of it. (Just like he did in Heat) Norton plays an up & comer added to help. Brando is the one who brings them the job. Basset well quite honestly isn't really needed. For me the best thing about this film is the technical aspects of it. So few films Day of the Jackal & the aforementioned Heat are two that come to mind where we are brought into the world of the characters as opposed to viewing the from the outside. The film almost makes one feel like you are there in the Montreal Customs House with both Norton & DeNiro as the heist is going down. Sure Norton does an almost spot on Rainman. Only Dustin Hoffman can do it better. While others may call it slow I call it engaging. The people who find this slow are the people that need something exploding every 5 minutes or some kind of assinine car chase. There is a twist of course, but what is a caper film without one? Now for Marlon Brando. What a treat it is to watch him. The guy has still got it. To see three of the best actors of each of their respective generations is really a joy. Do yourself a favor & rent this one on DVD. The added footage has one scene done 3 ways as Brando & DeNiro just kind of improvise.  That alone is worth renting this film. All I can say is watch this film with the vision that you have never seen a film in this genre & you will love it. I'd easily give it 8 out of 10 stars.

It does take a while to get started and much of the first half hour is a waste of time, but as it plods along it has some interesting elements, particularly once the heist begins. Edward Norton's role was well played. And Robert De Nero did a creditable job. Marlon Brando was okay too, but didn't have a great deal to do in this film. Elderly Canadian character actor Paul Soles did a fine job with his janitorial role. While the acting wasn't a problem, the script was. The problem is that the caper wasn't quite believable. Norton is smart enough to plan the heist, but not smart enough to see the outcome which, although part of his plan, appeared to backfire in a surprising conclusion. He should have known... We're left to wonder was De Nero just lucky or really cunning as a thief? The Score is worth viewing, but better films in this genre include Ocean's Eleven and The Thomas Crown Affair (only the recent remakes, not the originals). Likewise, a better De Nero vehicle, though darker, was Ronin. Just as The Score takes place in French Canada (Montreal), Ronin uses Paris, Arles, and Nice as its French backdrops. Ed Norton was also much more sympathetic in the funny and touching Keeping the Faith. If you see The Score that's fine... but see these other films as well for better entertainment value. Overall, a 7.5/10.

The Score is his first entry outside of the comedy genre, and he's done a fantastic job creating an intelligent, absorbing, and refreshingly different kind of crime flick.Robert DeNiro stars as a brilliant, skillful thief who wants to settle down with his girlfriend, a perfunctory role played by Angela Bassett.  Problem is, he is sucked in by temptation and a huge payoff into doing one last job for retired thief and friend Marlon Brando stealing a priceless scepter from thr 1600s.  Enter Edward Norton, who works at the customshouse being targeted for the robbery and feigns mental retardation, enabling him to get info and access about the security system.Perhaps the most attractive, engaging aspect of The Score is the variety of its three lead actors, arguably the best actors of their time.  Each brings uniqueness and individuality to their roles, all the while bouncing off each other and creating a mesmerizing powerhouse of ensemble acting.  DeNiro is calm, collected, and ever so professional as the tired, eager to withdraw thief, Marlon Brando is believable as the seasoned, retired thief with a been-there, done-that attitude. and Norton comes off as both arrogant and knowledgeable as the rookie.  Angela Bassett, a good actress, has little do here besides dote on DeNiro; her role is severely underwritten and could have benefitted from more development.  The Score is also an usual crime movie in that there are no grandiose shootouts, no car chases, and no climax culminating in huge fireballs and explosions.  The screenwriters have wisely chosen to let the talent of the actors and the complexity of the caper take center stage, and director Frank Oz slowly and laboriously paces the film as it leads up to the heist. relying solely on dialogue and clever plot twists to build suspense. While The Score may sometimes seem to tread familiar ground in its plotting, the bevy of talent bursting from the three lead actors more than makes up for story lulls; in fact, it makes The Score feel more like an authentic, old-school thriller than an explosion-filled, testosterone-fueled heist flick.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Norton, Deniro at their finest","Date":"11 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This movie contained great actors, acting greatly to provide the film with everything it needed.

He uses the sewers. I mean, not to mention that city sewers starting from very close to surface dive _at least_ 4 floors below the ground, im sure that custom house security wont notice the trapdoor from sewers to the most secure area of their warehouses. 2) The security guards. Cameras go out in house. Guards watch tv. Cameras go out second time. Guards still watch tv. Noise from offline cameras starts annoying guards, so they call tech support. WTG. Not that they should check the reason or something. Also, guards fail to notice that the janitors radio is about twice heavier with gun hidden inside than normally. 3) Passwords. 4 numbers, security ) Also, no cameras, no motion detectors in main control room. 4) Logic behind the young guy actions. Whats the point to smuggle in the gun through metal detectors if he is going to get stash of things from other source later? Why did he leave witnesses who could identify him? 5) The piano the treasure was hidden at the first place. It was infected with termites, so custom workers encaptured it into polythene.

Weak pun, I know.  But, I needed a way to start off this review, and couldn't think of a way to start it off with a &#145;bang'.	Still here?  Good.	The Score is another good summertime movie.  It doesn't try to bend genres around; it doesn't try to be something that it's not.  It's a movie about a heist.  Not a heist with aliens, not a heist with talking animals, not a heist with a Will Smith song about it, just a heist, plain and simple.  Knowing that, you know what to expect, and that's what makes it good.	One of the fun things about heist movies is trying to see what will go wrong.  I'm not spoiling anything here &#150; things falling apart is one of the staples of the genre.  It's seeing how and when and why the plan falls apart that keeps us going to these movies.	That being said, here's a rough breakdown of the plot Nicky (DeNiro) has been in the business for 25 years, and is thinking that it's time to &#145;retire', live with Diane (Bassett), and run his jazz club full-time.  Max (Brando) offers him (you know what's coming) One.  Last.  Score.  A score that will pay Nicky $4 million.  Now, for something this big, it's gotta be tough, and an insider will be needed.  Enter Jack (Norton), who as &#145;Brian', a developmentally disabled part-time janitor, has unrestricted access to the Montreal Customs House where the heist will go down.  From here we connect the dots, try and out-guess the crooks, try and figure out what will go wrong, make mistakes, watch the plot twists, and enjoy the show.	This is a strict genre piece.  It's not breaking any new ground here.  It's not Reservoir Dogs, and doesn't try to be.  There are some Tarantino-esque bits of dialogue (not so much with the sailor talk, but with the terse bits of detail), but, that's to be expected.  With the massive footprint that Quentin Tarantino made on American cinema, it's nearly impossible not to steal from him, especially in movies about crime.  The actors are all stock characters, but the actors who are playing them represent 3 generations of the best actors American cinema has ever seen.	Marlon Brando may be a big fat man now, but his acting is still top-notch.  His eyes are incredibly expressive, and you can still see elements of the animal magnetism that made him a star.  Robert DeNiro... well, he's Robert DeNiro.  He's not charting new territory like he did in Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, but, it's not like he's going to turn in a bad performance.  Besides, it's not like he's acting for Martin Scorsese.  Edward Norton is so good that it's scary.  His portrayal of &#145;Brian' might be better than Kevin Spacey's &#145;Verbal Kint' character in The Usual Suspects.  Angela Bassett is there as a plot device &#150; not quite a femme fatale, but as a motivation for DeNiro's character.  But, in order for a character like that to be able to hold her own against the likes of Brando, DeNiro and Norton, the actress would have to be good.  And, she is.  	And, what about Frank Oz?  You know that you've seen that name somewhere before.  Oz was &#145;Miss Piggy', &#145;Fozzie Bear', &#145;Yoda', &#145;Grover' &#150; yup, a Muppeteer.  He's done acting without a Muppet, too (as the man who gives Jake Blues his belongings back when he leaves prison in The Blues Brothers, for example).  Now, after having worked with George Lucas, John Landis and Jim Henson, Oz has clearly learned something about directing.  He's not a notable director, he's not prolific, but he puts out good work, and he can handle actors who really know their stuff (Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss in What About Bob?, Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin in Bowfinger).  This makes him almost ideal for directing a film like this.  He's not out to make a huge artistic statement; he's here to make a good movie.  And, he has.	Is The Score a classic?  As a film, probably not.  As a chance to see three truly gifted actors on screen at once (and the first time they share the screen together is electric), it just might be.  Odds are, this will wind up being a sleeper hit, either in the theatres (like The Usual Suspects was), or on video (like The Shawshank Redemption was).  Either way, you're not going to go wrong with seeing this movie.

I didn't go expecting much originality in terms of a plot, or directorial techniques, etc. and thus was, alas, not disappointed.The plot is simple - Let's rob something that's really difficult to get to. In The Score's favour the film doesn't irritate by introducing trivial sub-plots to pad itself out. The whole film is based around the heist and it doesn't bother to deviate. Good. However the plot itself doesn't contain much. It's a fairly mellow affair - no big blazing gun battles, no huge body counts - which would be grand except what there is isn't enough to quite sustain the pace. You're never exactly bored by the movie, but neither are you ever excited. The movie failed to draw in this viewer too often.I feel that I must now mention the plot twist. When the twist occurred I started praying nearly that it wasn't as obvious as it seemed. I nearly shouted at the cinema screen. I hoped they wouldn't do the twist, that there would be no twist. I was wrong. This was one of the most disappointing twists I've ever seen in a movie and just made me feel disappointed they felt the need to be clever and introduce it at all (and yes it could be argued its consistent with the nature of the characters but, in some ways, it's also very inconsistent).What saves the movie from falling into extreme averageness? The performances. Brando's is nothing to particularly notice - it's perfectly competent. De Niro is good, as always, and, as always, he seems to be playing the same sort of character. There's nothing quite wrong with it - he's excellent about it - but we've come to expect it. Nevertheless he makes watching the film enjoyable because he is consistently good. The acting performance of Edward Norton however is highly commendable. I'm in awe of his performances. He seems to merit the label as the best actor of his generation. His dual role as a thief and the handicapped janitor are both portrayed excellently, particularly the latter character of Brian. He can switch from being the cock-sure young thief to the amiable simple young man with admirable ease. Watching him here made me able to enjoy The Score whereas another actor in his place would most likely have made me begun to tap my fingers.In short The Score is quite an average movie in terms of everything but acting. If you can appreciate the actors qualities then you should be able to enjoy yourself for a couple of hours watching it. "},{"Title":"Hmm.

While viewing the film at a local theater, I couldn't help but notice how well the plot flowed. To say the least, it was very linear, yet unpredictable at the same time. There were no annoying sub-plots taking over the story, the cast was supreme with top-notch acting and the thrills came not from blood-soaked violence, (The Score is probably the least violent heist movie I've seen in a long time, furthermore making it wonderful to watch)but from the intellectual turning points of each of the characters.      When the movie starts out, we learn that Robert De Niro (in a fabulous performance) is a jewel thief and has been recruited by his old friend (Marlon Brando) to do one more favor for him before his retirement. He wants De Niro to steal a scepter from a museum, where it's been hidden in a...... well I'm not going to actually give it away. It's your job to see the movie first.

You know a film is good when it's not slapped with some completely incomprehensible violence/gore, which is why The Score is excellent. Even though the F-word is uttered quite a bit, I can't quite see what the heck kept this movie from getting a PG-13 rating. Some people in the MPAA are just paranoid I guess. But honestly, there is no violent content in the movie that deviates greatly from the story-line, (or no violent content AT ALL for that matter) which puzzles me further about its rating.

Now that's a good cast, especially if Brando flexes his acting muscles.Add a good script, a concentration on character rather than action, perceptive and careful direction from Frank Oz (In & Out, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Little Shop Of Horrors and countless Muppet stuff), and there we have it, a very good heist flick.The plot has many of the classic elements. Crack safe cracker Nick (De Niro) is lured to do one last job by crime boss Max (Brando). The heist has been initiated by new kid on the block Jack (Norton) who's been casing the possibilities of a very big payout for a very acceptable risk. Jack has infiltrated the building where the item to be stolen is kept under tight security.Now Max has to get Nick in on the job. The film had opened with a safe break that nearly goes wrong. We see Nick perform exceptionally well under pressure but we also see the sweat on his brow. We've been introduced to an older, careful thief, getting tired of the risk. The camera and the story centers on high tech, especially crafted, safe cracking equipment but mostly on the personality of the man using the gear.Brando and Norton enter the picture and again we're enticed by character and plot rather than action. Take the bullets and chases out of the Mission Impossible films, add much more capable acting, and we enter The Score.Frank Oz's direction of The Score is tight and economical. The film mixes the aridity of excellent drama with the tenseness of a tantalizing story. It's not great art but it's engaging. It's terrific to see Brando actually making an effort. With the exception of the charming Don Juan DeMarco (1995) Brando has appeared to have been pretty lazy in recent decades. Edward Norton and De Niro continue to never let us down.The Score does have some lapses. Angela Bassett as De Niro's girlfriend is pretty cliched and I'm sick of nerdy, mad computer freaks. Would criminals use mobile phones as much as we see in this film and what of the lead in to the discovery of the item to be pinched?But those are pretty petty items in relation to a film that's enthralling and very satisfying. Get in and see it.

But what makes this movie worth seeing is a few differences.First the pro (Robert de Niro) owns a jazz club, so we get to hear a little cool music. Next the location is French-speaking Montreal and we usually only have Canadian locations when Toronto is set up to be an American city because Canadian technicians work for lower rates. Above all, though, there is the intriguing casting of three terrific actors from three generations. Young Edward Norton is excellent in the most demanding of the roles; the eminently-watchable de Niro gives the kind of performance he can deliver in his sleep; while there is a rare opportunity to see the now physically inflated, but still commanding, Marlon Brando. Not anything like as good as it could have been, but still superior fare.

It follows Nick (De Niro), a night club owner by day and safe cracker by night who is persuaded by his business partner (Brando) to execute one last big coup before finally retiring. He maintains his uneasy decision, even tough it forces him to contradict his own principles, to work with a young hot shot (Norton) whom he doesn't know nor trust and to face an increasing number of complications as he comes closer to reaching his objective.As an unmistakable `heist movie', &#145;The Score' showcases technically ingenious ways to overcome the obstacles that safeguard the prize coveted by our protagonists. That alone, though, would not be sufficient to raise it above the level of other movies with similar themes. What distinguishes `The Score' is the superb realization of the movie on a number of levels the cinematography, which for example in the first part of the movie features a number of scenes against gates, portals and doors, as if to portend what the protagonist must face before getting his trophy; the dialogue, which most of the time flowed quite naturally even if a character said something unexpected; the acting, especially by De Niro and by Norton, who was quite credible as a thief impersonating a mentally handicapped janitorial assistant; the simple but effective story line; and the three dimensionality of the characters, who as criminals not beyond trying to trick each other nevertheless retain a high degree of likability.To be sure, there are a few technical flaws that were essentially ignored. For example, none of the main characters seem to consider that the meeting in the park to purchase the security codes might just be a setup; or that the same `laws of physics' that eventually force the Main Safe door open would have likely crushed or at least deformed the scepter and the container it was in. These are likely no great concern to most viewers, nor do they need to be, as the rest of the plot, particularly with its punch at the end that illustrates the tagline more than makes up for them.On a final note, this film is proof that movies prominently featuring criminals in their professional activities do not need a high body count to be suspenseful and exciting to an adult audience.

Only the presence of Edward Norton and the liberal use of the f-word link it loosely to the present.  It's also very obviously targetted at a lately adult born in the 60s audience.  It screams sophisticated adults only, from the big name cast to the cod-jazz soundtrack to the faux-european setting (Montreal doubles for what probably should have been Paris or London).  To its credit, with the exception of The Crimson Rivers it is the only big-budget film this year with a plot that keeps working all the way to the end of the 3rd act, and where the French film's plot finally collapses into the improbable this one stays true to its self-imposed reality and delivers an obvious but effective double-twist.

In the intermittent period,Robert De Niro's reputation as one of the finest actors of hisgeneration has remained unblemished. Time for a rethink. Afterthe unenviable hat-trick of Flawless, 15 Minutes, and, mostbizzarely,  The Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle, the sour-facedmaster of Method has once again opted to star in a movie thatneglects the most basic elements of storytelling and requires himonly to scowl a bit. And play with some cool gadgets.De Niro plays Nick, a veteran smooth criminal whose day jobinvovles running a Montreal Jazz bar, and whose extra-cirricularskills include breaking into a safe faster than Houdini could breakout of one. Asked by his eccentric middle man Max (a whale-sizedMarlon Brando) to endeavour on one...last...job for a cool $6million, his initial reaction is to refuse the prospect because of therisk. But after some persuasive encounters with the  up-and-coming young heister Jack (Edward Norton), he changeshis mind and - guess what? - the con is on.Director Frank Oz (In & Out, Bowfinger) has never tackled a thrillerbefore, and it shows - his lengthy, steady, shadow-shadedphotography is so concerned with mimicking noirish cinema thathe forgets to build up any tension for the first ninety minutes. He isunaided by a shocking script that allows for no conflict, noback-story, and no comprehensible understanding of what theobject they are trying to steal actually is. And our hero's motive? Ifhe does the steal, he gets to pay off the mortgage. Genius. If Ifinish writing this review, I can go to Starbuck's and get a coffee. Tobe fair, things do step up a gear for the final reel, but to say that aheist movie has a good heist scene is like saying that KarmaSutra has some sex in it. Of course it's not exactly De Niro's fault that it all turned out thisway, but, considering the influence he must wield in Hollywood, itsurely wouldn't have been difficult for him to demand scriptchanges that might actually have made himself and his co-starsshine in the way that they ought to. Movie fans all over the worldshould join hands and hope that he has now learned his lessonand can return to form.

Brando, DeNiro and Norton, performing SO badly in such a badly written movie is something that is definitely worth seeing. First of all, Norton's part bears a striking resemblance to his debut role in Primal Fear. It seems that he has a talent for roles that include faking a retarded/disabled person. And where Primal Fear was original and well performed, this role is not. Forgetting about the fact that the character he played was -- in many respects -- similar to the character in Primal Fear, his performance is definitely less appealing than the one in other movies, showing a more 'relaxed' stance on his role. DeNiro is a master of any role that has to do with Law Enforcement/Shadowy types/spies/master criminals etc. He has performed in a large number of movies at many different levels of realism/comedy and is universally accepted as a great actor. I am not so convinced only because his performances always revolve around the same type of person/character and adventurous situations. Even though I personally like watching Robert DeNiro's movies, I think this performance was disappointing. He does however stand out of the remaining cast. I will not comment about Brando since his role is fairly limited in the movie. The movie as a whole is a sheer dissapointment. It could have been a milestone, having three of the most respected actors of our time in its cast list. It is slow, badly written, predictable and it seems as if the actors are bored performing their parts. On the plus side, the photography (especially the way Montreal is depicted) is very good and was the only thing I enjoyed during the film. But then again there are so many more movies with DeNiro with more qualities and better photography than this one.

However, I must admit the usual goosebumps I feel before every movie got more intense when I went to see this one. Too bad I wasted my goosebumps on something so regular.There is nothing bad I can say about the acting(there rarely is with such a cast) even though Angella Basset, who is otherwise a superb actress seemed pretty lost in the action(perhaps due to her role).Anyway, it was pure joy to see young and old Vito Corleone back together(they never were together, but...). On the other hand, I have never been disappointed by Edward Norton's work and he once again proves to be a young, talented actor of a rank almost equal to his companions in this movie. He might not be as convincing as Kaizer Soze in his crippled act, but he comes pretty dang close. The Score has a pretty nice plot, but don't expect anything too complicated or anything brilliant. It's a nice crime story that leaves you happy, but doesn't affect you in any other way(as opposed to the Usual Suspects for instance). The Score relies on the sparks that fly when the three actors confront each other. Well, there are sparks, but they certainly don't light up a flame. The Score is a litttle dark, a little slow, a little not up to the competition. However, it is also a little genuine, a little pure, and contains just a little magic. It's a shame to see just a little magic when you have Harry Houdini, David Copperfield, and young Mr. Harry Potter. Better luck next time, magicians.

But I give him credit for keeping in the business, as he's one of the only classic actors still alive. As far as the plot, it was fair but predicatable. Ed Norton did a good job, but he's getting typecast for playing such dual roles, although he's quite good at it. Angela Bassett, who was billed as De Niro's leading lady, was a bit abesnt from most of the film. I would have given her a few more scenes, perhaps involving her in the final action bit somehow.

I am at a complete loss as to how this movie was so disappointing.  I left the theater spouting off things I heard idiots say about the Blair Witch Project; what a rip off!  what was the point of that? and things along those lines.  The movie was a little on the weak side to begin with, but the ending just killed it.While I was able to avoid any real information about the movie to avoid ruining it for me, all I heard was that the end was great, and I should see it before everyone started talking about it.  I have never been so misguided in my life (and I'm including my parents telling me that there was a Santa Claus).When Ed Norton's character pulls his double cross in the vault and DeNiro's character starts to almost cry, I knew something was up.  DeNiro throws down the bag, and Norton picks it up and doesn't look in it.  I figured right then and there that it was that fake one that we saw in a none-too-subtle shot earlier.  This didn't bother me.  I continued watching the movie waiting for the big surprise to come.  It never did.  I honestly can't believe that Frank Oz expected us to fall for that and act all surprised at the very end.  I normally expect more from my Jedi Masters.This movie finally made me realize that these kinds of movies are pretty boring.  Heist movies are either stupid and unbelievable (3000 Miles to Graceland) or realistic and boring (The Score & Heat).  However, Heat is one of my favorite movies.  So what separates realistic heist flicks between wonderful and insulting?  The only thing I can come up with is style.  A realistic heist movie is all about planning and executing with extreme caution in order to remove as much risk as possible.  In 'The Score,' that's all the movie is.  A rather straight-forward presentation of the job with a sorry excuse for a twist at the end of the movie.  This also points to people's moronic feelings that a twist at the end of a film equals brilliance.  Anyway, a film like Michael Mann's 'Heat' has a lot better character development (more in depth than spending a half hour establishing that it's one last job), an actual theme (DeNiro is constantly being pulled in two different directions), and the best police shoot out ever at the end (where the music stops st the firing of the first bullet).You have to avoid using too much style though.  If you pile it on, you'll end up with something that looks like Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, and Spike Lee exploded in one giant crap-fest.  I like those guys, but when they miss, they really miss; (U-Turn, Four Rooms, and Clockers).Of course the acting is good in this one.  Anyone who says otherwise is nothing more than a Steven Seagal loving freak who thinks that Leonardo DiCaprio should have won Best Actor for his guest spot on Growing Pains. Brando is Brando.  DeNiro has been better, but this performance was better than 15 Minutes.  And Norton never fails to amaze.  But why are we so quick to forget CopLand?  All the good actors in the world don't make up for a lousy script.  This is just plain dull.

Perhaps I am being a tad harsh but how is it that an inexperienced and unproven director in the field of drama/thrillers assembles an all star cast that composes Robert De Niro, Edward Norton and Marlon Brando? Not only does he assemble this great cast, but he delivers and unbalanced, poorly written, bland piece of filmmaking that is laughable at best in terms of its' standards as a heist film. Simply put, Director Frank Oz (&#145;Bowfinger', &#145;In & Out' and the voice of Yoda in the &#145;Star Wars' films) cannot master the fine art of suspenseful filmmaking as demonstrated in his film &#145;The Score'. Even the best directors have the toughest of times assembling great actors such as these in this film &#150; yet Frank Oz does. Why him? And what does he have to show for it? Nothing. &#145;The Score' has a lot of negative traits that find one will find simply unforgivable. How can one assemble such a great group of actors and have an end result that is dissatisfying and brutally disastrous? The only fantastic thing about the film is its' acting. Brando has been absent from the silver screen since John Frankenheimer's &#145;The Island of Dr., Moreau' in which he played a barely recognizable mad scientist. In this film he displays a comedic yet brilliant improvisational style that only Brando can get away with. Although he shares only a handful of scenes with his costars they are among the most funniest and poignant scenes in the film. Edward Norton does all that he can do with an underdeveloped character whose alter ego is a mentally challenged night janitor that allows &#145;The Score' to happen at the Montreal Customs house. Finally, De Niro is De Niro. Bobby D's style will never be boring in my book but something tells me that even he was unhappy with the direction this film was taking during filming.Yet, no matter how superb the acting is &#150; it is but only one of the important elements needed to deliver a great film. As for this film, there are many other elements that lack which drowns &#145;The Score' into a tiresome film. Once again, If I am being harsh, forgive me. Yet, let me remind you that it is not everyday that De Niro, Brando and an actor who is worthy to share screen time with these icons such as Edward Norton are all cast in the same film. Expectations were high and the result is tragic. The story sets itself in Montreal and it is great to see that for once the city is playing itself instead of standing for a New York or Chicago. These three men are drawn together to retrieve a heavily guarded ancient scepter worth millions of dollars. The film in essence is the activities that prepare these men for this daring heist. Such adventures include meeting De Niro's computer geek sidekick who hacks into computer systems and who has an eerie relationship with his mother. Or how about an exchange of computer codes on a bright sunny day in a park with a gun pointed to Edward Norton' s gut.  All these activities seem pointless if they are not developed nor shot in a manner that is gripping and comprehensible.From the opening scene where we see De Niro at work in a pointless display of his kindness yet aggressiveness, the intelligent filmgoer will quickly grasp the notion that this is a poorly made film with some of the greatest actors that ever graced our screens. Director Frank Oz starts the film off with a painstakingly slow pace that the film seems never to recover from. It seems that he does not have that style that must be developed over time and through experience that is a prerequisite to truthfully capture and convey the notion of danger and deceit. Want proof &#150; watch the climactic sequence in which an alarm goes off and witness the sheer disaster of about four minutes of film that is simply terrible to watch. Cameras are shaking as if pretending to convey the notion of fear and the editing is horrible and although our main character must elude danger &#150; we do not care.Simply put  - this film is a terrible waste of talent in terms of its' ability to gather three great actors in one film. Yet, the result is a disastrous and misfired attempt at creating a classy, elegant and stylish &#145;caper' film that does not score at all.Giancarlo's Rating *1/2  "},{"Title":"slooooooow, then a good finish","Date":"13 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This movie was very, very slow.

Some people want something expensive. They decide totake it. The thing is protected. They try to take it anyway.Really, by keeping the plot simple, the makers of this film are givenmore time to develop the characters, which they do rather well. DeNiro plays the stereotyped aging criminal mastermind looking todo his last job before retirement, but he does it with a ratherendearing and believable quality. It should be a tired role, but itisn't. Ed Norton plays the witty, mouthy, young criminalmastermind without experience which also isn't an entirelyoriginal concept. But the movie shines in developing a relationshipbetween the two that is surprisingly interesting. The quality of theacting makes it work. Marlon Brando is likable as an eccentric,slimy, but amusing enough contact between the two maincharacters. Angela Bassett is pretty much a time filler. Thecharacters, as written, aren't anything we haven't seen before, butwhat makes it good is that De Niro and Norton are playing them. There isn't that much to complicate the story here, and that is agood thing. It doesn't require you to strain your frontal lobe trying tofigure out what is going on. With that out of the way, the viewer cansit back and appreciate the subtleties of the suspense of theplanning and robbery itself.   The ending itself isn't incredibly surprising, (Norton seems to betypecasted in the role of character that turns out to havecompletely different side in shocking finale) but because of theaudience's attachment to De Niro's character, the viewer leaveswith a smile.  This isn't the Usual Suspects or other great robbery films of yore.But it keeps it easy, and doesn't tie the plot up in knots. In the end,it's just a story about two guys taking something that isn't theirs,and that proves to still be an absorbing film idea.

Look no further than The Score.  This film, which features a pedestrian screenplay riddled with predictable movie cliches, is still fun to watch . .. but mostly because of its stars.  Edward Norton, Robert DeNiro, and Marlon Brando take this dead-on-arrival film and turn it into something decent.  It won't be nominated for any awards, but The Score manages to succeed where so many other supposed 2001 summer blockbusters have failed -- The Score is entertaining.The Score is about an accomplished thief named Nick (Robert DeNiro), who's looking to leave his life of crime and wants to go straight.  His fence -- and friend -- Max (Marlon Brando) gives Nick an opportunity to commit one last score -- steal a $30 million dollar scepter from a heavily guarded vault in Montreal.  With his take from this job, Nick would be able to retire and live in peace with his girlfriend Diane (Angela Bassett) . . . but there's a catch.  (What a surprise, huh?)  In order to steal the scepter, Nick must work with the cocky young thief Jack (Edward Norton), who is the only person who can provide Nick with access to the vault.  Nick, who normally works alone, is forced to put his trust in Jack -- and Jack isn't exactly the most trustworthy of souls . . . .The Score is one of the most conventional movies ever written.  The second that Nick announces to Max that he'll be retiring after this one last job &#150; that he'll be going straight from now on &#150; the floodgates of movie cliches are thrown wide open.  (A movie about a criminal's last job?  WOW!  Hey, that's never been done before . . . yes, these words are dripping with the proverbial sarcasm.)  An older man saddled with a younger partner, tense sequences involving digital countdowns . . . the elements of the film are nothing new.  Even the `surprises' and `plot twists' in the film come across as stale, simply because they've been used verbatim in dozens of other thrillers and action films.  The only genuine surprise might be the ending, just because the film is wrapped up with such surprising speed.  After watching `The Score', you might find yourself scratching your head and wondering, `Gee . . . is that all?'Despite its banal nature, though, `The Score' still manages to entertain, if only because its cast and its director lend their best efforts towards giving life to this tired material.  Director Frank Oz takes `The Score' in a direction rarely seen in modern film thrillers &#150; instead of jacking up the testosterone and the volume of the film, and turning the film into an orgy of quick camera cuts and bizarre camera angles, Oz instead lets `The Score' move along at a leisurely, unhurried pace.  Moving at the slower pace lets some smaller moments unfold (watch the background for the way certain characters float in and out of a scene) &#150; it's refreshing to see scenes build at a gradual pace instead of having them jammed whole down the throat. Certainly, not every thriller or action film should have this laid-back approach, but it's a genuine pleasure to see every once in a while.  Under Oz's careful, calm direction, watching `The Score' becomes like sipping at a glass of favorite wine &#150; the taste is very familiar, but it's excellent nonetheless.The flavor of this `wine', though, comes from Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton . . . and they're outstanding.  Marlon Brando is only featured in a few scenes in this film, but he manages to steal every one that he's in.  Considering that he's usually on screen with either DeNiro, Norton, or both, that's no small task.  If anything, I found myself marveling at Brando, and wondering why the man doesn't do more films &#150; he's still so talented, it's almost obscene.  DeNiro and Norton both do a great job with their respective roles as well.  They both give their characters little nuances and subtleties that make even the most innocuous scenes stand out.  In evaluating performances, I usually ask myself, `Could other actors have played that part as well?  Or played it better?'  Well, with `The Score', I think there's only one or two in Hollywood who could've played the parts of Max and Jack as well as DeNiro and Norton . . . and there's no one who could've played them better.  `The Score' is a out-and-out clinic on outstanding acting, and for that alone it's worth watching.`The Score' isn't a great film, but it does contain some great performances, and it's presented in an unusual enough manner to provide some genuine entertainment.  Just don't be surprised if this trite, worn-out story seems familiar.

It is a heist movie, we've seen it before in different variations, but this movie was compelling nonetheless.  DeNiro plays his character straight down the middle, and slips into his role seamlessly.  He is a Montreal jazz club owner and also a professional high stakes burglar, who approaches his craft with caution and professionalism.  Edward Norton is the cocky young guy who has the inside info of a great treasure in the Montreal Custom House.  Marlon Brando is the man with the connections who is like the producer/fence of the whole operation.  In lesser hands Norton's role could be a generic one, but Norton once again proves himself as the man to watch in films, he simply walks away with this movie (with no disrespect to the other 2 greats).  As for Brando, well, I could say The horror, the horror, but he does lend his personna to his few scenes and it's fun to see him again.  Angela Bassett serves merely as decoration, her role doesn't flesh out DeNiro's character very much.As for the plot, it is very riveting after a methodical buildup, and certainly the ending was well worth the wait.

It didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it certainly turned out to be a great suspense film. Robert Denairo stars as a professional thief who has been in the business for 25 years and is looking toward retirement to settle down in his hometown, Montreal, and maintain his restaurant. His partner in business, Marlon Brando, approaches him with an offer to steal a sceptor in the Montreal House of Commons worth more than Denairo has ever stolen put together. With the aid of the cocky and devious Edward Norton, Denairo reluctantly agrees to take the assignment. Basically the rest of the plot revolves around the characters and their quest to pull off the scepter heist. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. There are not many elements to complain about other than I wish there were a few more scenes of suspense. There were a few parts in which I wished that there was less plot development and more suspense (unusual coming from me, seeing as how I feel movies today require much more plot development to be good). I also enjoyed the setting of Montreal, instead of the usual New York or LA setting (or even London or Paris for that matter). The ending was very enjoyable and did not drag on too long, but left me feeling satisfied. It did not try to play games for too long like the movie Entrapment (which wouldn't end!). The element of the movie I enjoyed most was that it did not turn the story into a shoot-em-up, 2 hour action scene with twenty heavily armed gaurds running down a hall getting picked off in bullet time by the main characters (which is a problem most movies recently have given in to). The movie was very entertaining and is one of those under-hyped summer movies I hope makes out well in the box-office.

Mr. Brando still controls the flow of the film whenever he is pictured.  His simple movements and actions are very entertaining and amusing.  Not to be out done, Edward Norton delivers the best performance of the entire cast.  His portrayal of both Brian and Jack illustrate the versatility of Mr. Norton.  He demonstrates why he is clearly one of the best in his generation.  Robert De Niro is the enigma of the film.  Mr. De Niro is one of the best actors of all-time, but in this film he seems tired and his performance is hackneyed. De Niro seems to have lost a step in the tough guy role.  This is not an insult considering it is a genre which Mr. De Niro helped to define continuously throughout his career.  In this particular film though it can be seen that he is acting, the lines and actions don't flow like they used to.  He still gives a good performance, but this may be the first step in the decline of the old Robert De Niro image. The Score itself starts out slow and develops to late int he film.  Much of the film has been seen before and, aside from the Norton scenes, provides nothing new to the audience.  The Score is simply a less extravagant Entrapment.  It's twists are easily predictable and offers no real elements of suspense.  The one major problem is that the film leaves the viewer hanging and offers no real closure to the story.

But if you're not hopped-up on the eye-candy of the latest FX-ridden forgettable flick du jour, you might find something of real value here. Blissfully lacking the latest frenetic Shaky-Cam look of TRAFFIC et al., the cinematography of THE SCORE was steadily and slowly paced so you could pick out some beautifully subtle touches. Most of the scenes are dimly-lit, with the details standing out as white-on-black (we generally perceive things as black-on-white).I'm not entranced by the performances of DeNiro, Brando, and Norton, which is a bit of a disappointment considering they're the greatest actors of their generations. Brando and DeNiro pretty much let the new kid do all the hard work; Norton ably fools a team of security guards with a Rain-Man style performance. In actuality he's casing a heist of a Custom's house and aiding DeNiro who plays a master thief.  Brando is their Sydney Greenstreet-ish backer. It would have been interesting if he'd been allowed to play it like a queen, but director Frank Oz (formerly Miss Piggy's puppeteer from The Muppets) wouldn't have it. Brando reportedly told him, you'd really love it if you could control me by sticking your hand up my a$$. Then he refused to film his scenes if Oz were present. (I guess DeNiro directed them.) If Oz doesn't get extraordinary performances from extraordinary actors, at least he delivers a visually-interesting film. The slow-moving story and camera allows you to appreciate the composition of the shots. There are thematic allusions in these visuals. It must be seen widescreen by the way. Actors are occasionally isolated from one another, standing on opposite sides of the screen at the extreme edges. I'm thinking especially of DeNiro's scene with Angela Bassett where they talked across the screen at each other through an expanse of emptiness.Also the indoor pool scene with DeNiro and Brando seems rather symbolic. The opulent interior is marred by electrical lines and cables, parallelling Brando's character finally exposing his deepest fears to DeNiro. They sit by the pool's handrail, separated by its sharp steely diagonal line. Oh, I'll shut up now and let you sort out for yourself if it amounts to anything.I'll just add that the ending felt a little flat.  If the heist hadn't dragged on for so long, the post-heist drama wouldn't seem to end so abruptly... and they could have dealt with other things.  The DeNiro/Norton tension wouldn't have stopped so abruptly.  Also they'd created tension about a nemesis for Brando but left it unresolved.  We're supposed to accept that he makes his payoff and lives happily ever after.

Basically, DeNiro's character had planned to retire, but he is lured out of retirement by the specter of a $4 million payday.  Norton is the inside man who cases out the place; he gains access by playing a night janitor who is retarded.  Brando is the man who gets wind of the opportunities.  Brando is terrific.  Having never before seen him in a film, I wanted to see why he is so highly regarded.  He is a very expressive chap and DeNiro brings his focus and intensity to his role.  Norton's character is cocky but talented enough to get away with it.  Norton himself is very understated and confident in the picture too.  He doesn't seem at all intimidated and in order to really make a movie work well, one needs a counter to DeNiro.  The pacing of the film is the strongest aspect.

By action I don't mean explosions and car chases, but scenes that crackle with suspense.  One of the best elements of the film happens to be Marlon Brando, who has one of his best roles in years.  He provides a character that is at times funny and warm, and also surprisingly touching (as in a poolside scene between Brando and De Niro).  It is a treat to see that he still has the chops, after years of speculation that he simply lost his ability to deliver a performance of real weight (no pun intended).  De Niro is effective as the retiring Jack; and Norton is once again quite good as De Niro's partner on the last job.The Score is simply a great Mission Impossible with a twist ending worthy of what came before.  It makes you realize what Tom Cruise's movie could have been like if the writers had put a little more effort into it.My Rating  * * * 1/2 (out of four) "},{"Title":"The Score doesn't.","Date":"29 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" You have a tired one last heist plot. Direction that never generates humor or suspense. And Brando sleep-walking through yet another where's my paycheck performance (why this actor is viewed with such awe totally mystifies me). All of this could have been charitably overlooked -- and Norton and DeNiro's low-key performances enjoyed -- if it weren't for the fact that totally illogical plot twists are tossed in that make no sense whatsoever. For most of the way this is by-the-numbers film-making. But, apparently in a desperate attempt to give the film some element of surprise, two characters pull major double crosses. But in doing so they only set themselves up for their own potential downfall. Think about it, right in the middle of the robbery, Norton's Jack double crosses DeNiro's Nick, endangering Nick to possible capture. But if Nick is caught, that leaves Jack wide open to being named as his accomplice. This is especially puzzling since Jack, though portrayed as being a very clever criminal, makes inadequate plans to escape and leaves behind a trail that makes him the main suspect in the robbery. Plus, since Jack is angry that he is getting too small of a cut of the loot, wouldn't a smart guy mention his dissatisfaction before the robbery? Especially since the robbery is impossible without his participation. We are supposed to be impressed by Jack's clever double cross, but what he does is absolutely stupid. DeNiro, however, double crosses Jack. But, again, if Jack is caught, wouldn't he naturally name Nick as his accomplice. And Nick's ploy is obviously not a spur of the moment decision on his part, because he brought the fake scepter with him to the heist. After the robbery and getaway, when the money for the scepter was in hand, the attempted double crosses would makes some sense. But to derail a carefully planned heist and foolish risk everything, only makes this passable caper film seem insultingly simple-minded.

De Niro anchors the film with his nuanced role as a career thief looking to pull off that last Big Job before calling it quits. Norton exudes intensity as a cocky upstart who takes more pride in fooling people than stealing from them. It's hard to know what to say for Brando at this point, except you're happy when he makes it through a film without attacking the camera guy or getting naked. Bassett does a commendable job with what is essentially mop-up duty.Everyone in The Score does well with what they're given. But what they're given is lacking, as the script doesn't really live up to those performing it. I know, how COULD it? And it is a competent script with some decent thrills, but it never rises above the genre's cliches. Had things gone a different way, The Score would have been a surprisingly good script for Eric Roberts and Michael Par√©.

The Score serves up the ever smooth Bob DeNiro, snickering Edward Norton, a welcomed-back-to-the-screen Marlon Brando and hold-her-own-with-da-boyz Angela Bassett. All this oozing talent is directed appropriately by a man use to puppeteering Frank Oz. How could it lose?And it didn't. The Score is a rich combination of talent, intelligent script and great direction.Here's the score...Nick Wells (Bob  Tribeca Boy DeNiro) is a master thief. He's also an upstanding citizen type who enjoys subdued lighting and fine brandy. He's smitten with a fine young thang, Diane (dazzling Angela Bassett). All he wants is to spend a little time around the house. Get to enjoy his rewards. So when what he thought was his eternal last job loses it's buyer ala a bronze casket six feet below the top soil Nick is lured by a long standing friend and colleague Max (Marlon Please- No fat jokes, I've heard them all punk Brando) into the quintessential last last job. Max wants, needs, Nick to join in with an inside guy named Jack and do a team job on a priceless (not to them) artifact.Natch, this last job is the √ºber heist that will set him and his sweet chocolate love, Diane up for the rest of their lives and their future off springs lives. Still, Nick is apprehensive.Enter Cracker Jack, wise Cracker, Jack (Ed- call Emily Blunt at 1-800-742-6565-Norton). Jack's a young bright uprising criminal who's has that strong odious belief that his poo above all others poo doesn't stink. Nick instantly hates him. Max kind of hates him. But they both need him. They all play nice.The stage is set. The job is a go, and it's a beauty. Physics and facts play a big role in assisting the mix-matched duo in pulling the job off. Nick an expert at safe cracking and Jack an expert at...well, BS and codes. Max? He's the friendly neighborhood fence (the guy who sells the goods-the thieves steal). A big time criminal fence burrowed in a large palatial home filled with deep cavernous crevices where one might hide an extra freezer or two to store food in for the winter or for a late night snack (Couldn't resist).DeNiro is a God. An acting God. He's also one of the sexiest men living. Of course it's a well known fact Mr. D enjoys the darker slices of female meat, and in The Score he's paired perfectly with a sultry Angela Bassett. The two are believable and romantic.Let's talk big old smitbug bite. Edward Norton. I simply adore this man. Why? Have you seen Fight Club? Or American History X. At first he appears all dorky and innocent till he opens his sexy brilliant mouth. The boy can act with one hand tied behind he handsome back. Wrap him up...I'll take him. The fact that he's apparently, an intelligent man as well, only ads a whipped heavy cream topping to the already devilishly decadant slice of man pie! Maybe we could chat about the downfall of the Turkish Empire pre- Macedonia as I hand feed him Godiva dipped blueberries? Just a thought...The cast usually tells a story about what you're heading in to see. The Pledge faux pas aside. The Score telegraphs it. It's going to be dynamic on so many levels! Frank Oz directs his human puppets to perfection, milking spectacularly sublime performances from some of our greatest living talents.And, frankly, all fat-guy-puffin-through-the-flick-like-a-black-sheep-Daniel Baldwin-high-on Twinkies and Fritos brand corn chips jokes aside, legendary Brando eases through his role as Max showing people why he's an actor's favorite actor. His signature voice softly delivering lines that had more then a few of teary eyed as we watched a hero, an icon, back where he belonged and in the company of actors, that could not just hold there own, but that shared the screen comfortably with this colossal (sorry) legend.Get out and see this.

You believe the guys in High Fidelity have worked that counter and knit together as a dysfunctional unit.

The gang's all there The soft-spoken safe cracker on his last job (DeNiro), the hotshot youngster with some tricks up his sleeve (Norton), the love interest (Bassett, woefully underused), and a wise old crook with a head for trouble (Brando). Around the story's corners lurk a thug, a hacker, a systems engineer, a janitor, a sprinkling of guards and jazz musicians, and each is memorable.There's some fun to be had watching these experts ply their illicit trades, but every second is played for tension. Fatal mistakes are always just a few inches or a few seconds away, and everyone seems appropriately nervous. Montreal looks lovely, and Oz leans heavily on its old world rather than the new. Architecture, antiques, and interior decorating frame everyone in an aire of sophistication that smoothes the blacker edges of their character.On a more personal note, it was delightful to see a crime drama with so little violence. Normally these films have double-digit body counts and gallons of blood. Here the violence is almost entirely intellectual, and every action is cautious, chosen, and sure.

In a sense, this is a score for the movies today.  Finally we see the young and old Vito Corleone together.  Finally we see the present Robert De Niro and the future Robert De Niro together.  This movie, although far from great, compliments these three actors nicely.  Frank Oz, a very good director of such films as In & Out and Bowfinger, takes on drama for the first time and succeeds.The heist genre of films is an interesting one, but it has left its days of innovation.  So if one was expecting great things from this movie, they might be a tad disappointed.  Really I see this movie as a tribute to the genre...not an addition to it.  It follows its genre in its classic style; it does not become wild in its plot; it does not have a gunfight/car chase/deadly ending.  The Score is pure and professional.  It's solid entertainment.Acting, well...I think this basically goes without saying...was excellent.  Norton and De Niro were both as solid as ever.  They fulfilled their roles realistically and completely.  However, Brando, who seems to have lost his acting talent since The Godfather continued to show this downward trend.  Angela Bassett, in all of her talent, had a cliched and one-dimensional character.  Unfortunate, too, because this role could have been written into something special.  Supporting performances were excellent.  This was the key to making this film an acting gem.Direction was also a plus in this film.  This was a very quiet, tense, suspenseful film.  The ending sequence was just amazing to watch; it was done with such efficiency and vision.  It also had suspense, some twists and turns, but nothing too fantastical.  It stayed on task, and that was the key to this movie.  Bonus points to the music, which was tremendous and very appropriate.Weaknesses existed.  Angela Bassett's character, Brando's acting performance, the lack of innovation (which I tend to look for in films), and the plot itself (nothing special) were all setbacks in this movie.  However, I found plenty of entertainment in this movie.  It was completely involved making me so, as well.  For that, this movie is a pleasant success.7/10 "},{"Title":"Heist films can be such fun, and such jazzy scores","Date":"21 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  The Score is a heist - a rather suspenseful one, especially when we get to watch De Niro's character Nick cracking safes in such technical detail. The critical sequence he inter-played with Ed Norton's Jack, alias Brian the innocent looking janitor, surely puts audience on edge - it's not horror, it's the dry-mouth excitement anticipating whatever comes next.An entertaining safe-cracking story that comes through without blood-spilling/killing is absolutely rare for a successful Hollywood movie these days. Bravo to the screenwriters and director Frank Oz. Of course, the stellar casting of De Niro, Norton plus Brando is quite an attraction to The Score. Howard Shore's music is so jazzy, befitting the exciting moments and suspenseful sequences; while at times, the wisdom of having no music at all in the background worked simply well. De Niro is as strong as ever portraying Nick the 25-year experienced pro, reluctantly taking on this one last job, which was getting more challenging with complications as the plot proceeds. Norton is perfect in the role of the inexperienced, self-important, greedy Jack. To complete the triangle, Brando certainly complements/complicates as Max with the 'resourceful' ideas. Angela Basset is the love interest to Nick and inspired his decision to end his 'crime streak' for retirement. It's refreshing that the locale is not NYC but the city of Montreal with spatters of French. The object of desire is a sovereign sceptre. This reminds me of Jules Dassin's Topkapi 1964, the mother of all heist capers with dazzling high wire act mimicked by many films (like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 1996.) Istanbul is exotic, and a cast of Melina Mercouri, Maximilian Schell, Peter Ustinov, and Robert Morley, is simply irresistible. There's also Charles Grodin in 11 Harrowhouse 1974, a London caper with mounts of diamonds heisted with the suction help of James Mason and lovely Candice Bergen; chase scenes involved a van, a sports car and men on horsebacks. The Score really has no car chase scenes - that's its simple beauty.    If the entertaining, suspenseful plot of The Score without blood and guts or car chases is too 'clean and tidy' for you, try director Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast 2000, a thrilling British crime drama, brilliantly scripted by Louis Mellis and David Scinto, with sensational performances from Ben Kingsley and Ray Winstone. Sexy Beast is entertaining, suspenseful, with some blood and guts, some car scenes, and a clever and tidy plot with a locale of Costa del Sol, Spain, besides the underworld of London for a jewelry heist. Story-wise, The Score is quite earnest, Sexy Beast is thrillingly surprising, 11 Harrowhouse is rather delightful, and Topkapi is the most fun of all. More heist flicks Peter Yates' Hot Rock, The 1972 with Robert Redford, George Segal, and Zero Mostel having fun stealing a priceless diamond; Richard Brooks' $ (Dollars) aka The Heist 1972, with Warren Beatty, Goldie Hawn and Gert Fr√∂be outsmarting heists in Germany.

It's paced well, the story is mildly interesting, Ed Norton has some good moments.  Why then, do I feel so depressed after seeing it?  I think it's because this film continues the long slide of mediocrity of film in general and Robert DeNiro in particular.  DeNiro seems to have made nothing short of a conscious decision to stop challenging himself and his audience.  15 Minutes? Rocky and Bullwinkle?  Men Of Honor? Meet The Parents?  What is this guy thinking? Considering the method acting firepower assembled for this film, the result should have been incendiary. Instead we get an adequate film that could have been mildly entertaining starring just about any three decent actors.  The script is OK (unless you are tired of seeing films about criminals that don't seem to portray any downside to their chosen lifestyle) Frank Oz's direction is acceptable but uninspired (except for one scene involving Brando and DeNiro conversing around an empty swimming pool).  Marlon Brando is still interesting to watch in spite of himself, Norton's youthful energy practically carries the picture.  But in the end, it's a pretty humdrum movie you'll forget soon after you see it.  Maybe this film is somewhat a victim of expectations, but then again if we don't have high expectations of these three, who else should we have high expectations of?

Whether it took a Jedi mind trick to get the elusive Marlon Brando to return to the big screen after a six year absence remains to be seen.  Stories of tension on the set, between director Frank Oz and Brando may have lead some to believe there are serious problems with the film.  The truth is, co-star Robert Deniro took the directing reins for some of Brando's scenes and things look flawless.  Fortunately for Oz, there are only three key scenes with Brando throughout the film.  Unfortunately for the audience, these three scenes are not enough.  Brando plays an aging mastermind, who is urging two younger thieves to steal a priceless Egyptian scepter.  Deniro coolly plays a middle aged, almost over the hill thief who wants to get out the game and have a normal life, running a jazz club in Old Montreal.  Edward Norton is the up and coming hot shot con man who is looking for a big risky score.  The three men intricately plan to infiltrate the heavily guarded Montreal security house that contains the scepter.

Ed Norton, also a great actor, does a good job as well but the performance loses some steam when you consider the character and his plot involvement is somewhat of a rip-off of Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) in the Usual Suspects.The poor script writing is most evident at the end of the film when Norton's turn occurs.  It is cliche and feels contrived and hackneyed - thrown in the film out of necessity of an overly dramatic climax rather than one built constructively from intelligent character development.  Being a fan of films that offer an alternative/change from the MTV paced shlock (usually starring Freddy Prinze and his ilk) that comes out of Hollywood on a regular basis, i was disappointed to not see more done with this film and talent.  It could have succeeded at that rather slow pace; however, to do so it should have been (and could have been) smarter and more refined - for example, cutting the Bassett character completely and instead building more of the DeNiro/Norton relationship to make the plot twist actually worthwhile and rewarding).

Consequently, he begins to reexamine his lifestyle, and concludes that a settling down would be a well-timed decision to make at this point in his life and career. He sees crime as merely a necessity in order to preserve the truly important things &#150; his woman and his club. With this mindset, the sequence of events may be appreciated. Basically, nearly the entire movie consists of obstacles to the score repeatedly arising. Namely Nick is almost discovered in the sewer, Jackie is almost caught stealing papers in the basement, access codes are missing from the building and must be attained elsewhere, the park exchange nearly goes awry, Nick discovers that the score is only Max's attempt to get out of debt, and both infrared and new cameras are placed over the sceptre. With so many occasions for error present, why does Nick go through with the plan? As he tells Jackie, `I never took a long shot.' Everything is taken in and accounted for, even human greed. A tension exists between the criminal skill of Nick and Jackie. From the first robbery, we are aware of Nick's expertise and professionalism. With Jackie, great pains are used in showing that he is no mere amateur &#150; as Nick first suspects (and later confirms). Both are shown to be attentive and calculating, but only one may come out the victor. Nick conquers because he has been the most disciplined and the most professional by taking the most variables into factor.Thus the ending is consistent with the flow of the movie. After many obstacles of similarly small magnitude are overcome, a more formidable challenge must be reckoned with. It demonstrates that even seemingly not-likely obstacles must be taken into account. Nick gets his money and can finally settle down with his lover and club life. This ending is difficult to stomach after the excellent consistency of the beginning and middle of the ending. The audience cannot help but think, `If his lover and his little club are so important, why is he so obsessed with becoming a millionaire?' After all, before the score, he already had his woman and club. It was his criminal activity that had compromised these supposedly prized items from the start. The movie seems to suggest that robbery itself was Nick's most prized hobby, not as a means towards something more meaningful, but as an end in itself. There is nothing negative about this. I could see how the thrill of a perfect crime could become pleasurable; it is the movie's inconsistency in this regard that vexes me. Valuing crime fits perfectly with the valuing of calculation and discipline that the remainder of the movie speaks for. But this would not be widely accepted. A happy man-reuinites-with-woman ending is more cinematically allowable. It's almost a law. Yet the movie could have easily soften up the blow for this ending. Though it would have still been inconsistent, it would have been less inconsistent if just a few minutes were used to develop Nick's supposed love of his woman and club. Instead, said woman and club are always described in ways only relevant to the upcoming score. This lack of development further shows that the score was the only truly meaningful thing in Nick's life. It is not this theme, but the movie's obstinate refusal to present this obvious theme that detracts from the movie &#150; for me.   Basically, the consistency of the score is maintained for naught when we realize that the motivation for the score is inconsistent with the flow of the movie. The potential for a good movie was lost because of the need for the movie to attract audiences and make money. A happy movie is always preferable to a consistent movie.

Nick is a methodical thief who cracks safes.  He is ingenious, smooth, smart, calm, and in the life of crime a veteran which is a rarity in his line of work.  Nick lives in Montreal but he does his work outside the country, knowing that the risks are less.  However after finishing one heist in Boston his co-hort Max (Marlon Brando) tells him that there is another big prize they should go after.  Inside a heavily guarded customs house in Montreal is a gold scepter that is priceless a real French treasure.  It's ironic Max should mention this since Nick has told him he's had enough and wants to quit.  He's even less interested when Max tells him he has someone else working for him on this particular assignment, a young brash kid named Jackie who has charmed his way inside pretending to be a retarded janitor who is casing the joint for the heist.  After all Nick works alone, and Jackie is everything Nick detests, cocky, arrogant, anxious, and impatient.  But while Nick realises the payoff for the heist would set up his retirement for his bar and business he goes in even though his girlfriend (Angela Basset) is less impressed waiting for him to pack it in.The initial tension between Nick and Jackie is kind of a let down because in the end you know somehow it will lead to an important obvious climax at the end.  Also there's nothing complicated or intriguing about the characters they are pretty straight forward and carbon cut outs.  With this in mind you'd think you'd have a recipe for a cookie cutter movie.  But it is anything but that.DeNiro and Norton's chemistry is great, and the movie pays off huge in describing the crime, creating uncertain snags, and generating big suspense once the heist is set out in motion.  Flaws are a slow start, and the wasting of Angela Bassets character which in many ways was underdeveloped and probably not even neccesary.However, 'The Score' is a very good edge of the seat thriller with great chemistry that lets you overlook many possible errors in the films that would deter from the actual believability of the caper.Rating 7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Interesting Story with Unexpected Twists","Date":"17 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  The best part, and I've read this before and concur, is the unification of three great generations of actors.

True, Hollywood regularly releases even poorer, less entertaining movies, but this film's reason for being, and for being aggressively marketed, begins and ends with the `concept' of having arguably the best actors of the last three generations interacting on screen together. Alas, providing Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton with a screenplay that gave them something challenging, credible, and meaningful to do clearly did not enter into the production equation.  Instead the audience is subjected to a ludicrously weak re-working of a genre &#150; the caper film &#150; whose limited possibilities were played out decades ago. Even then, has there ever been a caper film whose pacing was as botched as this? I certainly can't remember one. The Score plods agonizingly through its first two acts only to lead to a visually frenetic third act with predictable twists, loose ends galore, and an abrupt, anti-climactic resolution. What's more, the only one of these great actors who was appropriately cast was, oddly, Brando. His age, bulk, and whimsicality create a Sydney Greenstreet air, cheerful but profoundly corrupt, that this screenplay unsurprisingly fails to develop. Instead, his character becomes a simpering pawn of a yet bigger boss whom we never see, whose interest in the caper is never revealed, and whose function in the plot is utterly superfluous and unresolved. DeNiro is simply too old and out of shape to credibly perform the elaborate gymnastics that the caper requires of his character. Norton's character is (a) poorly motivated and (b) an embarrassing imitation of the actor's career-making split personality role in Primal Fear. Angela Bassett, the fourth `name' actor on the bill, is given absolutely nothing of interest to say or do. Her casting in the role of DeNiro's love interest does represent another commendable, if small, step in the direction of color-blind casting although the romance itself adds one more unnecessary and unconvincing sub-plot to the mess.

I also didn't particularly care for the ending. **possible spoiler**While Jack had admittedly done something bad (for lack of a better word, that is -- but to me it seemed more a fit of insanity than actual presence of logical motivation), it is still hard to believe that he deserved a fate such as this movie happily tosses him in what seems like a half-baked desperate attempt to land a fitting ending. It is far too well-rounded.. it seems like the ending to a fairy tale. Difficult to accept or believe, really. The score to this movie also could have been better. The same monotonous not-very-exciting theme playing over and over as if on a loop got pretty old pretty fast for me.Robert De Niro's performance as Nick Wells, a jazz club owner slash underground thief who is thinking seriously of retiring from the latter profession, is relatively bland and not notably exciting to watch. However, this movie has secured Edward Norton's position in my small list of favorite actors. His showstealing performance as overconfident amateur thief Jackie Teller, partnered up with De Niro's Nick, is incredible. He is young and impulsive, he is confident, he is intense. And as Brian, the mentally challenged janitor's assistant that Jack role plays on the midnight shift, Norton is -- as always -- amazing, believable, and impressive. Can we please give this man an Oscar nod already? Otherwise.. Marlon Brando lisps/slurs his lines in a particularly annoying way and his performance is nothing outstanding; and Angela Bassett, while delivering a solid performance, was unfortunately given a role that was completely unnecessary and could (and most likely should) have been dropped as excess baggage.I'd say this movie is worth seeing, despite some of the negative things I've mentioned. It's a fun ride, really; good entertainment. Plus, seeing Ed Norton, sweaty, in a beater, looking rather suspicious and intense, is surprisingly -- and almost even disturbingly -- appealing. Hm.

Contrary to other comments, I enjoyed Brando's work in this movie. Perhaps it wasn't much of a challenge for him, but he looked like he was enjoying the role, and he delivered his lines with the wisdom of the veteran actor he is. Have to agree that Norton had the best role and did the most with it. De Niro looked a little bored.This movie was another case where a trailer can tell too much, as was observed by another commentor. What is up with these trailers that don't whet your appetite but, rather, force-feed you the Readers Digest condensed version of the whole movie, synopsis of plot and all? As a result of having seen this movie's trailer, there was no unexpected plot twist for me. Pretty much had the thing figured out before sitting down; went to see the three actors... and that was reward enough.

Some potentially flat, stereotypical characters come alive in the hands of three elite actors.  Norton's acting as well as his acting within the context of his character shows just how amazing he can be.  Expect to see a nomination if not an Oscar for this role.At times the pace of this movie can drag, but I believe that the reason for this was because the movie wanted to give a very authentic feel.  Endless planning, meticulous preparation, and hours upon hours of problem solving goes into planning something that, the quicker it's over, the better.  The movie was very true to this.  The cost of this authenticity is a slower movie, which is not as exciting as it could be.  Though I'm sure it's not a popular opinion, I feel this was a very good tradeoff and made for an excellent movie with depth rather than flash on the surface. 9/10 "}{"Title":"While not fantastic, best movie so far this year","Date":"15 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  While considering the poor quality of movies so far this year, this is so far my favorite.

This is a dull, uninvolving story that contains virtually nothing new.Just how many times we have seen the veteran thief who takes a young thief under his wing, I don't know.  But this film proved that Hollywood has gone to the well, or perhaps the film vault, one too many times.Running down the plot is sort of a waste of time here,but it involves a long time heist man agreeing to-- here's one you've never heard before -- one last job!  There's a sedentary mob boss, a young show off and the old veteran who has to hold it all together.  The old vet even has a girlfriend who he'd like to settle down with when its all over, but she won't start picking out curtains and wallpaper with him until he agrees to put away his jimmy for good.Like all big heist movies, it takes a lot of planning to accomplish and we sit through every agonizing moment.   When the big day comes, there are of course, unexpected complications and unexpected twists.This has all been done before and done better in so many movies, you couldn't count them all.  But try Asphalt Jungle, The Killing, The Getaway and the French classic Bob the Gambler. All of them put this film to shame.What is supposed to save the film is its A list cast.  Not exactly. Angela Bassett has about three flat scenes playing a generic girlfriend. Marlon Brando starts off very well playing the mob boss, but some of the fun is just seeing Brando again. His role is really so thin that he quickly runs out of the stage business he's doing to beef it up, and then the character sort of drifts away.  Ed Norton is quite good as the aspiring young master criminal and sort of steals the picture.  Robert DeNiro, however, is the top star and he pretty much sleep walks his way through the film.  He displays very little emotion and even less charisma. In fact, I'm not sure he smiles during the entire picture, adding to the doom and gloom of the whole thing.Overall, a weak effort from DeNiro and you have to wonder what if anything he saw in the role, or was it just something,like the heist in Score, that he just did for the money. Hey, how's that for a plot? A veteran actor wants to get out, but prodded on by a young hotshot, he agrees to do one last part in a  dangerously bad.....oh, never mind!

The acting was amazing the story was beautiful but several things made this just a regular low-rate movie.  The location was neither exotic nor prestigious, the movie should of been developed more into a longer film, though the end was surprising it was too quick and snappy.  Overall its just another movie, it lacks the luxury of a Mission Impossible type movie, lacking the James Bond scenes, giving it a dull ambiance.  Ok movie, don't recommend to see it in theatres.

In the pasteboard role of adandyish rich guy who backs a high-tech safecracker (RobertDeNiro), Brando seems to delight in every aspect of acting--andhis big scene, desperately convincing DeNiro to finish a job,reminds you of why he stands alone in the canon of movie actors.(And it sure ain't all about technique, either.) The notion of three generations of acting greats was a littlemisconceived from the start. The third part of this equation shouldrightly be Sean Penn, not that flashy teacher's pet Edward Norton.(Gimmicky, self-loving, smart-alecky, oneupmanship-obsessed,and oddly likable, Norton is the Dustin Hoffman of His Generation.)The misconception was compounded by the miscasting of FrankOz as the director a bright, solid maker of conventional comedies,Oz is no John Frankenheimer. And the script (credited, amongothers, to the great Lem Dobbs) is a routine caper number, withinterminable scenes between DeNiro and Angela Bassett abouthow this is gonna be the last criminal thing I do, baby, swear onmy life. What a snore! The movie reminds you of the seventiesmovies we elect not to remember.Brando aside, the movie reeks of actor vanity. One gets the sensethat the players ran roughshod over Miss Piggy. Norton'scharacter, screaming at DeNiro, I'd appreciate if you'd give me alittle respect!, seems all too self-consciously concocted with aneye to the meta-text of the actors' careers. DeNiro's notoriousfondness for black women is indulged with the casting of AngelaBassett, who gives one of her hoky, church-organ-voiced,smite-you-down performances; she has become stiffer and moreboring than Ashley Judd. How did his hero Brando's joy in actingnot rub off on DeNiro? He gives a groggy, depressed  performance--a veritable parody of his superlative minimalist workin movies like CASINO and HEAT. He needs to take some time off,and, one hopes, look for a good script and a good director again.It's been some time.

Does the roll of the disappointed/doting girlfriend really add *anything* to the story?

But, as soon as that third act begins, it takes the easy, cliched way out, and falls into a terrible mess.Angela Basset's character could have been cut out, then the movie would have been shorter and better. Also, the motivation from that girlfriend thing is cliched.The three leads all deliver powerhouse, possible Oscarworthy performances. Brando is hilarious and very realistic as De Niro's boss. De Niro finally does a good job in a good movie- that hasn't happened since Heat. His character is traditional De Niro, and he plays him really well. But the standout showstealer is Edward Norton. Every single performance this kid has given with the exception of Everybody Says I Love You has been in my mind Oscarworthy. He again shows us that he can give us an intense performance that is also funny, and shows more of how the character is.Good cinematography, and mediocre Shore Score, and slightly flawed direction by muppeteer Franzk Oz are some the the film's elements that I have not mentioned.You should rent this flick, it's not worth theatre prices, and it has no huge F/X that condemn it to be seen only at the theatre.

Frank Oz does a bang-up job directing his first non-comedy film.  This modern-day film noir has some great dark and moody camera-work.

Now, I'm no saying it will win anything, it is way too enjoyable and pleasing a movie for the Academy to ever recognize it, but it is a movie that automatically raises the bar for movies this year.De Niro is good as the ultra-professional thief who knows everything there is to know about burglary and has every cool little gadget there is to have. Brando is ever billiant as the backer of the big heist, Max, who, though dosen't have a lot of leeway to develop his character, is still a thrill to watch. The ability to still look like your not acting, that everything is new and fresh, is something that must be admired. The true star of this film, though, is Ed Norton. I have been a fan of Nortons now ever since Primal Fear and have been dissappointed that even though many of his movies have become cult classics, Fight Club and Ameican History X, he has seemingly never really showed up on Hollywoods radar screen. Simply put Norton is the best at what he does. He can be the dorky guy next door, the murderous villian, or the cool thief as he so brilliantly plays in THE SCORE. Norton is the center of attraction every time he is on the screen and some how seems to completely overshadow both De Niro and Brando when he is paired with either one of them. Though this performance may not land Norton an Academy Award it will hopefully secure his first major hit.But, to get to my original point, why oh why do studios decide to give away EVERY LITTLE PLOT TWIST IN THE TRAILER? This movie's twist ending is completely give away by the trailers and though I won't give it away here, anyone who watches the trailer will more than likely figure it out. Why does this continue to happen? Why do movie studios sabotage their own projects? I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end and I am so dissappointed that I did. The Score is a wonderful movie and most definetely worth the price of admissions, but something has got to be done about these trailers. I mean, with a movie starring Brando, De Niro, and Ed Norton did they really believe that they couldn't just run a vague yet interesting and drum up some interest. I hope that in a year when movie like Pearl Harbor and Fast and Furious can make $100 million + then the Score will hopefully be a big block buster.

The film enjoys the same pluses as Heat, all around good acting and a story line that doesn't suffer from many distractions. However, Heat did suffer from several points of confusism and redudance which The Score doesn't. Robert DeNiro plays Nick Wells, a career thief who's ready to retire and settle into his Montreal jazz club that he owns. However, Max(Marlon Brando, who definately gains 50 pounds by the end of this movie) convinces him to participate in one final score. Nick reluctantly agrees and is teamed up with the young and cocky Jack(Edward Norton). The catch here is Jack gets a job posing as an autistic janitor for the Montreal Customs House, where the heist will be taking place. One problem with the film is that it takes a long time to set up. Me, being a fan of the genre, wasn't turned off by the slow pace, but undoubtedly other movie watchers were. However, Oz creates an extremely suspensful final 30 minutes, which more than pay off for the not so great beginnings. As for the acting, DeNiro is good as always playing the foucused, no-nonsense, im in control actor. Many people overlook these type of roles, claiming DeNiro is overrated, but fail to realize that he perfect;y fits into characters like Nick Wells. Norton did a fine job as always playing both roles. It's fun to see Brando again although he was hardly anything special. A minor disappointment was the miscasting of Angela Bassett, who played Nick's girlfriend. Bassett is too good of an actress to be confined to a small role like this. Like I said, the final 30 minutes do several good things. First, they keep the audience in suspense. Second, they contain a couple of solid plot twists that wont quite blow you away but you realize the film has earned them. But most important;y, Oz makes a wise decision in straying from the use of violence. The Score would have been like any other 2001 action picture if it did what people expected, end with a bunch of messy shootouts and explosions. However, the film stays true to the story and accomplishes at least as satisying of an ending without any fireworks. For that, the people involved with The Score deserve some major props.Rated R for language and a minor sex scene  2 hrs 5 min  A Paramount release "},{"Title":"One of the year's best films","Date":"14 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I just saw The Score and thought it was a near-perfect heist caper.

I did not expect Norton to be so good, but on the other hand, I wasn't even expecting to like this movie.

Of particular note is the performance of Norton as the young upstart out to show the veteran safecracker (DeNiro) a thing or two. He is not about to be ripped off by the likes of Brando or DeNiro and this makes for very interesting bi-play during the film. Bassett's role is not major and you wish there was more to it but I think that would have detracted from the flow. To top it off, the film is graced with the excellent vocal range of Cassandra Wilson....too bad there wasn't a little more of her, but again that would take us away from the main plot.

Light a few candles, throw in an NYC jazz club ... am I in Casablanca? Although you might see the Sydney Greenstreet character in Brando, any similarity to the classic ends right there. But I'm sure I've seen this movie before. We are introduced to these characters early on, but they are really only playing their stock roles. Nick Wells (Robert DeNiro) stages a heist in a mansion under the collective noses of revelers who were probably snorting their wealth up their collective noses. He's a smooth operator, keeps cool in crisis and scores - which surprises you? Max (Marlon Brando) mumbles through charming scenes without once unclenching his teeth. The aging master is surrounded by decadence and improvisation... and the character we all recognize as Brando. Jack Teller (Ed Norton) is never better and... well, you see where I'm going with this. I can't help myself! I just saw this derivative film noir. I thought Norton was going after the Spacey Award for sensitive portrayal of a differently-abled character but one role was enough for him. Aside from all that, the story maintains suspense and you'll be charmed by the plush interiors and the classic architecture of old Montreal. Well's love interest (Angela Bassett) provides him with good reason to mount that one last heist and for his late-life crisis. The Renaissance man prepares his amour a meal and even consults her in on his career decision. Prepare to distrust everyone though. All these strong personalities an their attendants remind you that we're not dealing with choirboys. But who's going to do what to whom? That'll cost you the price of a ticket. It's worth it for one film in 2 hours to combine DeNiro's Ronin, Brando's Don Juan deMarco and Norton's Fight Club. But those wouldn't be a waste of your time either. Don't expect to see these three together again in the near term. They all demand center stage and there's not enough room in any script for the three. Actually there's not enough room on the screen for Brando by himself. Cheap shots aside, they may have scored but they didn't win. Crazy Beast beat them at their game.CyCy "}{"Title":"Standard heist movie, but pretty good","Date":"14 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I went to see this movie and shelled out $8.75 purely for the cast.  As Edward Norton said, these guys could've been reading the phone book and I would've shown up to watch.  Was it a good movie?  Yes, in comparison to some of the other crap out there this summer.  Was the script up to the standards of these three actors?  No way.  This is a very standard heist movie.Caution, some spoilers ahead.The opening scene is extremely anti-climatic.  In fact, it's dull.  You get a feel for the precision in which DeNiro's character works, but it didn't raise my blood pressure at all, nor really draw me into the movie.The middle of the movie dragged in some parts.  It was all set up for the final heist, but certain scenes got downright boring.  DeNiro's character is the only one that really has any depth.  While Norton's character has a lot of good lines, I never really got a good feel for what his story was and how he knew Brando's character and got into all this in the first place.  And we really find out nothing about Brando's character.  He seems to be there to deliver funny lines.The final heist is, however, very exciting and very original.  I was on the edge of my seat.  And the ending is really good.  You'll leave the theatre laughing at the cockiness of youth.NitpicksAngela Bassett's character was completely unnecessary, and her role was TINY.  I heard many of her scenes were cut, so hopefully we'll get to see those when the DVD comes out.All three actors give fine performances, but I had a hard time buying Norton's handicapped act.  Even though I think he's a great actor, it felt very fake to me.During the final heist, Norton's character had to know that Danny the janitor would eventually come looking for him because he was gone so long. You'd think that he would have covered himself a little better on that end. Was this because he was inexperienced?  Possibly, but it felt like a huge and obvious slip up.  And why on Earth did he let him live?  Duh.  Even I've seen enough heist movies to know what he should have done.  And why didn't they loop the tape in the security cameras instead of shutting them off? They had to know that the security guards would come looking for them eventually if the cameras were off for that long.End of spoilers!I do recommend this movie, purely for the cast members.  Don't expect a whole new idea, here.  Like I said, it's a standard heist movie.  There are some memorable scenes and good dialogue, and compared to a lot of the crap that's come out lately, this one's a keeper.  I look forward to seeing the extras when the DVD comes out.

The man has done numerous Muppet voices and even provided vocals for Yoda in the Star Wars films.  His talents extend past the obvious voice-over ability, as he has directed some terrific comedies in recent years.  When I think of Oz, films like BOWFINGER and WHAT ABOUT BOB? come to mind.  About a month ago I watched the trailer for THE SCORE.  It looked like a gritty crime drama, and featured some very serious actors in what seemed like a very serious story.  I was shocked to see Directed by Frank Oz at the end of the trailer, and have been wondering ever since just what exactly to expect from this film. 	THE SCORE begins with our protagonist Nick Wells (De Niro) pulling off a seemingly typical robbery from a posh estate, while the owners are holding a loud and lively party just a room away.  We follow him through his numerous drop off points, and eventually into his decorative home, all the while getting the impression that this man is obviously a seasoned professional.  A few minutes later Nick walks into a fancy restaurant, which just so happens to be his, and is quickly met by Max Baron (Brando) who offers him a rather big job.  At this point we can tell that Nick wants out, but the payoff involved with this latest gig creates quite a temptation.  There's a woman named Diane in the mix, played by the lovely Angela Bassett, who really likes the idea of our hero leaving his second line of work.  Nick begins to realize that by pulling this last job he can not only retire to a life of normalcy, but also satisfy the desired wishes of the woman he loves.  One major obstacle stands in the way.  Max informs Nick that in order to pull this gig off he must work side-by-side with the very man who lined it all up.  Enter Jackie Teller, played by the unbelievably talented Edward Norton.  Jackie is everything Nick isn't.  He's impulsive, hot tempered, hasty and new to the game.  But Jackie has all the keys to making things work.  His mentally challenged alter ego named Brian just so happens to work in the facility housing the precious prize.  Everyone there trusts Brian, and nobody considers him a threat, which makes him the perfect inside man.  Just when it seems everything is coming together, our buddy Nick begins to have second thoughts.  The whole thing seems like too big of a risk to take.  To make matters worse, the job gets more and more complicated with each passing minute. 	THE SCORE is an effective thriller filled with just the right blend of tension and light comedy.  Each character seems good and bad in different ways.  We're never really sure who to trust, or how safe anything really is.  Frank Oz has constructed a fantastic movie that has everything we could want in a film.  The strong cast and solid performances help fuel the story even further, creating an exciting and engaging feel that holds the audience tightly within it's grasp.  De Niro is and always will be the man who can play any role and be convincing.  Brando is used sparingly, which is good since he is apparently way past the days of oscar-caliber acting.  Max is a background character plain and simple.  What the enormous Brando does with it is just enough, and that suited me just fine.  Angela Bassett, looking incredible as always, plays the troubled love interest with simple yet effective form.  This wasn't a big role, nor was it all that important, but it serves the character of Nick and she makes it work.  The standout performance here comes from Edward Norton, and for those of you familiar with his work, that should come as no surprise.  Watching Norton seamlessly transform from Jackie into Brian is impressive, funny and almost disturbing to a degree.  You have to wonder if he's pulled this act before, because it would almost certainly work in the real world.  Having the two lead characters as opposites of one another is nothing new for movies, but witnessing two acting greats like these is always fun.  I'm very impressed with Frank Oz.  He had already proven himself as a capable comedy director.  Now he can add the successful ability for drama and thriller to his merit, thanks to this very well-made film.  There's isn't anything too terribly surprising in THE SCORE as far a story goes.  What you get is a good movie with good acting.  That's something that seems hard to find these days.

Well, with another film that might have happened, but instead we, the audience, get these three in The Score, a crime thriller that is almost too subdued and dull for it's own good.    Norton plays a customs house worker who is looking to score a cool $30 million dollar deal by having DeNiro break in and steal a 350-400 year old French scepter. Brando, whose a friend of DeNiro's feels that Norton's plan can work and both DeNiro and Brando could retire if the job is pulled off.   This premise might have worked had it not been so obvious what was going to happen next. Director Frank Oz has assembled three of the greatest actors in film history, but doesn't give them much of anything to work with.   But to the film's credit at least the acting, for the most part is good, Norton does a great job as usual and DeNiro is good as well. As for Brando, well he's not bad either, though I had to strain to understand him during a couple of scenes.

As Robert DeNiro is pulling off the clich√©d `one last job', you can't help but feel some anxiety that he is going to get caught.  Wait a minute!  He's a criminal!  He should get caught.  Despite the clich√©s, which abound in this film, The Score has some good elements - namely Edward Norton.  Norton never ceases to amaze me as an actor.  Whether he is playing a crazed neo-Nazi (American History X) or a priest who is in love with a childhood friend (Keeping the Faith), Norton is simply amazing.  Here he plays the `man on the inside'.  Pretending to be mentally disabled, he goes to his night job as a janitorial assistant at the Customs House in Montreal to case the place.  He is so convincing as a mentally disabled person that you begin to wonder why he is wasting his time as a criminal.  He should be an actor. You know that Norton is good when he outshines the once great Marlon Brando, who, because of his tremendous girth, can do little more than loll around and incoherently mumble his lines.  I kept waiting for him to grasp his chest and drop in mid-sentence.  Poor Angela Bassett.  She probably thought that she was signing on for a great role.  Look at the other talent she would be costarring with DeNiro, Norton, Brando.  What an opportunity! Alas, she is little better off than Halle Berry in Swordfish.  Reduced to the typical girlfriend who wants her man to go straight and narrow.  At least she doesn't have to expose herself.

I should say he's simply a decorative Dom DeLuise ornament that's hardly appealing in contrast to the spectacular furnishings of Nick's home! I can't help wondering whether his character does much to sustain the viewers' interest. And De Niro's character?  Banal and somewhat pathetic! His acting has become rather stilted and his character isn't interesting enough to make a drastic deviation worthy of the viewers' excitement.  However, Norton's Jackie is an interesting character.

Far, far from being a great treat, it's predictable and slow paced for a crime thriller. And it's hardly dramatic, witty, nor humorous.  And events that lead to the ending are questionable.

Instead, we get an almost casual scene that could have really been with any actors.

And Marlon Brando is there only to provide a little comic relief in it all.The movie starts off a little slow.  The opening heist is very weak and the first third of the movie feels like its nothing but setup - which it is.

The heist scenes are good and the ending is a great idea, but there just isn't enough conflict there to carry the whole movie.  De Niro's character is too much in control of the situation and we never feel as if he's in any danger of anything.  He's just too cold and collected for the ending to really be satisfying.

If you told me that the man behind Bert, Fozzie Bear, Grover and Yoda could stop throating and direct a heist movie involving three of the best actors in the business, two of whom are practically legends, I would have been sure you were running a Ponzi Scheme. But Frank Oz went behind the camera to manage the team of a very taut and compelling suspense movie with three actors that could all bat clean-up by themselves--each representing a different generation Marlon Brando who began his career in the 1950's playing lower middle class urbanites, Robert DeNiro, who began playing tough-talking New York Italians on the rough end of New York and Brooklyn in the 1970's, and Edward Norton, the new kid on the block, whose similar resum√© includes amoral characters with a nervous-angst that comes off like Anthony Perkins on speed; he began his acting career in the mid-1990's in films also in urban settings. And of the three performances, the most compelling may surprise you.Brando, the grand titan of the three, probably has the least interesting and weakest performance of the three, although it's still decent but maybe not quite up to the usual Brando standard. He plays Max, the man setting up and funding the heist. Next in line is Robert DeNiro who could act his way out of a paper-bag, although the character he plays in The Score, Nick, is not unlike many other roles he has played in recent years, somewhat akin to his leads in Casino and Heat. Here he plays a genius safe-cracker. Certainly, his acting is right on the money, but nothing that he hasn't done before. Believe it or not, the standout performance of this film is Edward Norton, playing a character who acts like another character. Norton plays a rookie thief, Jack, who has landed a job at the Customs Office in Montreal, Canada, by pretending he is Brian, a retarded graveyard shift worker who manages to fool the other employees and security guards that his brain is a few flakes short of a complete bowl of sugar cereal. It's Norton that really makes this film work as well as it does.The film opens with DeNiro on one of his heists lifting a prized diamond-studded necklace. And it almost backfires. Later, Brando approaches DeNiro with a new proposition to heist a piece of priceless antiquity, a late renaissance golden scepter made in the 1660's. Brian, the retard who is really Jack (Norton), had known about the scepter and its new home in the Customs Office. Somehow he gets himself hired by the bureaucratic office by playing a seemingly harmless mentally-handicapped who brings a lunch and a little used tape player to work every midnight. He listens to recordings of Mozart in mono while he mops the floors. But when his associates aren't looking, he's scouting out the premises and stealing documents. Max then has to convince Nick to work with Jack on the heist. The three become sort of reluctant bedfellows. But once the commitment has been made and the plans start being executed, the movie really takes off.This is a highly entertaining heist movie, with a bit of a twist at the end. The standout talents have to be Edward Norton as Jack/Brian and the director Frank Oz. Oz' compelling direction is as good as anything Brian DePalma or Martin Scorsese could have dreamed up.

Lots of movies were made to revive the genre (Entrapment, The Thomas Crown Affair (1999), The Italian Job (2003), Ocean's Eleven (2001), etc) that was at its peak in the '40's. Most heist movies tried to adapt the style and atmosphere to modern standards, by putting in lots of pace and action. The Score tries to be more traditional, by putting in many old genre elements such as backstabbing characters, a 'good' and honest thief, a couple of twists and many other things. It however doesn't really work out. The story doesn't flow well or quick enough, mainly because it features too many sidelines and it takes unnecessary long before the main action occurs.The story and concept of this movie might had worked out fine in a '40's film-noir type of heist movie. The story and concept just doesn't fit in a 2001 kind of environment and style of film-making. The movie is now nothing more than a slow moving not exciting enough heist movie, that is still made interesting by its big-star cast.Of course by having a cast with actors like Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando and Angela Bassett in it, expectations are high. It already is for most reason enough to watch this movie. I'll admit that with a different cast with less big names in it, I probably would have never watched this movie and I wonder who would have had. The actors give the movie a certain class and lift it to an higher level. Robert De Niro does a good job as an aging thief but even better was Edward Norton in a sort of double-role. The Marlon Brando and Angela Bassett roles don't seem to be significant enough for the movie and it seems that the movie could had done without them. They provide the movie with some unnecessary and not always interesting subplots that makes the movie unnecessary slow and too layered. Especially disappointing when considering that this was Brando's last featured film role before his death in 2004. But I'm sure that if his character was played by a different and unknown actor, I wouldn't have even complained about the character. It's just purely the fact that he is being played by Brando that makes his character and its significance for the movie so disappointing. All the more reason why it's disappointing is that this is also the only movie that features Brando and De Niro in one movie together. They both played the same character in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II in and they're both big names in the genre, so more was to be expected from their first collaboration. I also couldn't help thinking in every of the Brando sequence's; 'Is he wearing any pants right now or not?', because of the known fact that Brando refused to wear any pants all the time during the shooting of the movie.The movie still tries to put some life into the movie by giving it some twists and creating some unpredictable characteristics for the two main characters. It does provide the movie with some good moments but it doesn't help to really make the movie a more exciting or tense one to watch. I found the movie to be terribly lacking in some good pace and tension to make this movie a pleasant- and good to watch movie. This was just not really my idea of a great, original, tense movie.But of course the movie still does have its good points. The earlier mentioned big-star cast is definitely one of those good points. The movie also has some good production values, with good looking sets and camera-work. It makes sure that this movie still remains a perfectly watchable one to watch maybe once. After that also all of the surprises will be already gone of course.Not my idea of a great, tense and entertaining movie but a good and interesting enough one to watch, still. I just hope that in the future Frank Oz will stick to directing only comedies instead.

I'm still not sure I understand all that method-acting. Either you can do a role or you can't. Brando certainly couldn't be screaming Stella! along about then, but he convinced me he was a fat man with style. Too bad he didn't have more screen-time, but maybe he was such a pain - walking around the set naked ? Ugh ! - Frank Oz decided he had what he needed from him, mostly his NAME. No doubt Brando needed the cash; I don't think ANYONE in the cast thought they were doing Oscar-quality acting. SURPRISE ! Everyone needs to work. Except for the last hour of the movie, if those scenes weren't first-takes, then they wasted a lot of time. Taylor's and Salem's script, except for the park-scene, couldn't have had too many words on the pages.The cast was so skilled, put-up the sets and let them do their work. Yeah, DeNiro has aged; he can capitalize on it. As for being the best actor of his generation, what happened to James Dean, etc.?? Angela Bassett played her role well, with just enough sophistication to make a good contrast to all that macho stuff. After all, she played an airline-stewardess, not a psycho-slut. All the other supporting cast did what they were paid to do, to make the movie seem real.Ed Norton definitely stole the movie. His portrayal of the handicapped guy was brilliant. His plain-ole guy was very convincing. He absolutely out-acted everyone in the park-scene. His character was intelligent but vulnerable, and he recouped after every screw-up. His cockiness seemed to be so natural, and his shock to discover he had been out-betrayed appeared to be genuine. Bravo Norton ! Heist films make me wonder why I'm not smart enough to do that. All that preparation and stress keep me honest. Those high-tech elements during the heist-scene were well thought-out and would never have occurred to me. I wasn't able to figure-out what would happen in the end, because I don't attempt to do that. Let's see it on the screen ! The Score worked for me - I'll no doubt watch it several times again.

And it certainly is a fitting adieu for this legend because his scenes with Robert DeNiro crackle and shimmer with all the life and depth which those who saw him during his prime remember. More than that though, as the documentary about the making of the film on the DVD reminds us, this is a historic summit of great actors from three generations. And indeed, all men-De Niro, Brando, and Edward Norton-dispatch themselves quite well in a film that one might say is simply a frame on which to hang these stars. This might be true to some degree but it is also an excellent, minimalistic heist movie. Frank Oz, who has ably overseen some very funny comedies like In-n-Out, Bowfinger, What About Bob, shows a deft touch in managing his stars and allowing them to shape the direction of the film. He knows these performers need minimal direction and he allows their performances to set the direction of the film accordingly. His stars do not disappoint and neither does Angela Bassett as Diane, who distinguishes herself in her role as Nick (Robert De Niro)'s sometime romantic interest. The two seem to have an understanding relationship. Both are busy and have many interests, but also enjoy each other's company. However, Nick is considering leaving his life of high-end robbery and committing himself more fully to Diane. She does not put any pressure on him but when he makes a false promise of his intent to leave the life immediately, it causes tension in their relationship. Max (Brando) convinces him this last heist is worthwhile because of the potential pay-off, and in spite of the fact that the theft would require Nick to break several self-imposed rules implemented to protect him from endangering himself-namely an unwillingness to work in his town, a commitment to working in the United States (while he lives in Montreal), and a commitment to working by himself. Nick must co-operate with his inside man, Jack (Ed Norton as a brash, intelligent, and ambitious thief). While Nick hesitates about committing to the Max- planned heist, Jack makes a persuasive pitch for his ability as a thief. Max, unbeknownst initially to Nick, has pushed this heist to some degree because of financial indebtedness to a gangster named Sapperstein (Richard Waugh). Nick is angry when he learns of this but because of his long working relationship with Max and his personal affection for him, he agrees while insisting that his cut should be more than normal. The film is, as producer Gary Foster says during the Making of&#133; featurette that this film is a character study about personable, intelligent men who are robbers. This is true. But the heist element of the film is not given short shrift on account of director Frank Oz' commitment to creating an aura of realism. The heist and the preparation for it are very well outlined. Oz knows how to maximize the emotional heft of each of his participants. He deserves a lot of credit for recognizing the assets at his disposal and not interfering excessively and thereby diminishing their potency. The creation of a film with such a wonderful balance of an interesting set-up and such well-outlined characters makes for a very satisfying and entertaining film.

The club provides a good model for 'The Score', with talent a-plenty in the line-up but which proves formulaic and unremarkable in practice.  'The Score' is a heist movie, but it's hard to care about the characters, who seem cleanly detached from the criminal underworld and who have little real motivation for attempting this job; only Marlon Brando's character appears to have a reason for doing what he does.  All that leaves is for us to be impressed by the technical execution of the job; but it's a set piece that manufactures problems in order to solve them, and thus far less thrilling than a real life story like 'Escape from Alcatraz'.  the fact that a lot of the action takes place on computers also doesn't help, and there's a predictable twist at the end.  As for the actors, Brando (in his last on-screen role) is alright but his character is minor; De Niro is dull, while Edward Norton's performance as a man for whom disability is a disguise is palpably inferior to Kevin Spacey's masterclass in 'The Usual Suspects'.

They are intricate and sometimes confusing but seldom (if done correctly) boring. In the 90's, the caper movie has become more taut and action packed but also, far too often, filled with more filth than a litter tray that's long overdue for a change. But this one works mainly because of the heavyweights in it. And they are the old masters, Brando and DeNiro.Too much has been made of Marlon's weight and the psychological aspects of why he has become such, but never - and I repeat that - NEVER does he disappoint in the acting department. Marlon Brando has always has the gift of making you want to see him more. He even lingers in your mind long after he is on screen. Just look at the Godfather and see how little screen time he actually has and yet anyone who has seen that film (and if they haven't, they must still be toddlers or live in a cave) can forget his contribution to that film and indeed to film history. The man is MAGIC.Now, we have Robert DeNiro, another follower of the method who knows his craft as well as the best jeweler knows his own. He is so real, it is sometimes frightening. We feel when watching him that this is a moment in a man's life who is not aware there is a camera present making all of his motions and emotions subject to public scrutiny.Now along comes Edward Norton, an actor whom I have always felt knows the moves and yet is always trying to impress us that he's not really acting, but is. It's almost as though he took a few courses in how to act before the camera and memorized the text of those lessons but doesn't give the emotional input necessary to a great performance.Still, The Score has power because of these three principal actors, the first two more than the third. My only complaint is that we don't see enough of Marlon or, for that matter, the much underrated Angela Bassett. Not to mention she's damn fine to look at.Still, the director Frank Oz seems to have learned how to position his camera and let the actors just do their thing within the narrative framework, but there is nothing spectacular about his contribution here. (Also, there are the stories of Marlon's chasing him off the set and riding him about being Miss Piggy.)So what we have here is an engaging though not great film but with the combined talents of some damned fine actors and a few who are just competent. I'm just glad this one is part of my collection especially now that we have lost Marlon Brando, a fabulous talent who never really peaked though some have said otherwise. Forgive them. They're young and haven't learned yet how to appreciate the classics. "},{"Title":"Archibald Tuttle where are you?

DeNiro and Brando are acceptable enough in their roles, though personally I expected a lot more from these actors. A couple of times it looked like they were about to nod off. Indeed, Norton's performance is quite the opposite. He is excellent, energetic and intense. Norton provides the film's most charismatic acting moments, and his character is the meatiest of them all. The actor has to play both a mastermind safecracker and a mentally handicapped janitor - not an easy task - and is completely believable in both roles.--The computer geek character in the film, I can't remember his name, is very entertaining. This character provides for one of the more suspenseful sequences of the movie (the codes being handed over) and his bantering with his mother is hilarious (Do you want some lunch? I'm on the phone BITCH!).--After the boring first and second part of the film (save a few entertaining moments), all the happenings (not many) in the plot lead to the final heist sequence, which is deliciously entertaining. While I was quite uninterested for the first 40 minutes or so, this final sequence was a miraculous saviour for the film, it got me completely involved in its happenings and all the goings-on were both surprising and unbearably suspenseful at times.THE BAD--In a film of this kind, romance is not at all necessary unless it has some kind of purpose in the plot. The Score features a romance between Angela Bassett and DeNiro that is wholly unneeded in the grand scheme of things. The romance provides for ONE interesting scene, where DeNiro faces up to the challenge of deserting his beloved for one more score and they have a bit of an argument. This is a good dramatic sequence but in the end doesn't really amount to much. Bassett has never been a bad actress in my eyes but her character p***ed me off a lot in this movie and she OVER EMPHASISED about every line in the bloody script. Even worse, the final scene of the movie is Bassett getting off a plane and hugging DeNiro as they walk off into the distance, as if the whole movie were about their romance. It wasn't, and I couldn't have given a rat's ass about what their romance scenario at all!--The final twist in the story is old, and I predicted it quite early into the final heist sequence. When movies take an old story and twist it around, it's fun, when they use clich√©s, one's we've seen millions of times before and are now sick of, it isn't. Plain and simple.the final twist was crap, and crap I've seen more times than I can count. It's a lame ending to a great sequence that annoys me more and more as I think about it.--I hate to be bland, but the first 40 minutes or so of this movie was BORING. There were a couple of interesting moments, but when all things are considered, it just seemed to run on forever until we got to the action, the pacing was awful, the characters uninteresting and the dialogue mostly simply exposition for the forthcoming plot. I was thinking a 4/10 around that time, until things began to heat up, for which it earned a couple more points.RATING6/10 - Well, as you can see this definitely isn't the perfect 'score', so to speak.

The Score does have deeper issues in its characters, but it doesn't follow up on the most important one - the wild card Norton represents. "},{"Title":"The plan failed","Date":"19 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  It is unfortunate with the talent on board this project, THE SCORE is a bit of a letdown. Ironically, a by the numbers exercise that leaves the viewer feeling like the victim of the crime. As a heist vehicle the film contains the necessary precise planning on screen, but you would have hoped the production itself could have seen the faults in its execution before delivering a flawed result. Indeed as part of the experience we might be entitled to our share of the takings. Sadly it seems the project made off with our cut.The result is a picture that does not give the actors (a draw to watch this film in the first place) enough scope to push their craft. There are too many wasted moments of dull editing and sequencing, with little to distract the audience (which doesn't say much about the dialogue). Indeed if the tone and pace of the film is played out in the low key, understated fashion we find here, then it needs to be anchored in interesting mis-en-scene, screenplay and ultimately larger focus.The mis-en-scene is unimaginative and neither suggests character's emotion or motivation as screen composition helps to. Scenery and locale say little save that we know the picture is going to be reserved due to the style of Jazz on offer. Color and shadow (we find De Niro in the dark so much that even Brando complains) only suggest secrecy and hidden agendas but do little to portray fatalism or mood. The framing is not in sync to suggest either emotional distance or are there sufficient close ups which would have allowed for more studied characterization. Both suggestions I feel would have allowed for more gravitas which would have also kept in line with the studied pace of the film.The screenplay delivers in a few scenes but generally the dialogue isn't engaging or emotionally binding enough to connect the viewer to the coolness on screen. There are some good light moments between De Niro and Basset and some comical lines given to Norton, which although keeping with the naturalistic dialogue was a nice contrast from the talk given to the heist itself, which was bland on the whole (see THE KILLING). Not that I was expecting to find cartoonish gangster language in a mature picture but the set pieces seemed stilted. Just going through the motions to fill space. It might have been better if there was less talk with dialogue kept to a minimum and totally spared down. A picture designed for physical acting, which along with my other suggestions may have suited this subdued heist film well.However where this film fails to engage the most is in its wider scope as a metaphor about the art of acting (see OCEAN'S 11). Ultimately the film concerns actors and the act of putting a film together. The 'item', the 'score' is the film itself. With the players squarely in the crosshairs, what should be a celebration of the talents of two of the most accomplished actors of the screen, and one of the most promising of the new stock never materializes. Taken in context of a film about getting a job done, or as Norton states to be 'treated with respect and as a professional' (ultimately the ambition of any actor), this leaves the whole project wanting. The one star who did deliver was Brando who belied his large frame to give a performance full of casual weight and ease. His attitude added well to the naturalistic feel, which was also a welcome release in a film of studied content.There could have been more time given to the relationship of De Niro and Basset. It would have allowed for the audience to associate closer with the picture and the core theme of De Niro wishing to leave his life of crime and find fulfillment in a healthy loving and trusting relationship. Instead their relationship is only offered up in as a cliched reason for 'one last score'. Further additions that may have benefited the picture could have expanded the theme of duality between De Niro and Norton (see HEAT). Although they are both criminals, the men differ in values of honor. As partners walking a tightrope of trust, some physical distance could have added to the tension. Or there could have been focus on the abundance of gadgetry used. A fetishistic viewpoint of the tools and mechanisms that offered an alternative attraction would have added interest (see THIEF).Though in portraying THE SCORE as a 'letdown', let this opinion be taken in the context of the expectations of the film due to its huge star power. We must also remember the standards that De Niro, Norton and Brando have set and as such the film can be seen as a watching some of the 'worst of the best of acting' going through the motions. There is nothing new or visionary to be found here and so the disappointment is watching proven talent unable to rise above the formula. As De Niro states in the film, his scores have never been 'fliers'.  So accordingly our share of the entertainment was somewhat limited.

Two things first, what does that actually mean when you say 'of the century'? The century had only been two years old when The Score was made so in actual fact; it probably was if you only count the heists that had happened between January 2000 and whenever The Score takes place. Secondly, why is it that every time a heist film comes out; it's dubbed as 'the heist of the century'? In recent years; films like Ocean's Eleven, its sequel Ocean's Twelve and the remake of The Italian Job have been made and have achieved success to a degree; these films, I feel, have also got people more into heist films but what they perhaps fail to realise is that The Score was there before most of the examples I gave and thus; shows you don't need to remake a film from the 1960s or indeed make a sequel to a remake from the 1960s. The Score is an energetic, nicely paced, well thought through crime film that combines romance, gives the different audiences something each to map onto and has, what I heard somewhere else, 'the three greatest actors from three different generations' those being Brando, De Niro and Norton.What I found to be distracting for the first twenty or so minutes of The Score was some of these elements mixed in with others. The fact the heist has actually already been planned by a character not yet involved in a major way and the fact nothing much needs to be thought through for the early part (lending more time for the Nick/Diane love story to progress) was disappointing. Part of the reason I liked Ocean's Eleven was down to the way they planned an announced it to the other members whilst showing us where it was they'd do it. What made it better was the fact it was seemingly impossible. In The Score; the item they're after is merely in a safe, in a basement &#150; nothing too fancy.Also, the point of Marlon Brando's character. The fact the only reason Brando was cast seems solely to be down to nostalgia (as he wasn't getting much screen time round about the time) is odd enough but he really didn't feature too much and a tiny twist that cropped up about half way through didn't seem to have a major affect on what the outcome was going to be. What's more, most of the 'three greatest actors of three different generations' actually just stand around for the early part bickering to one another about the whole thing &#150; hey, you think you've got it tough? Check out those fellas' heist from Ocean's Eleven.What was clever, though and what really involves the audience is giving them different characters to relate to. I was once told that if you don't have characters in the film the target audience can relate to &#150; they'll totally zone out and hate your film. Here, there are two relatable characters one is Nick Wells (De Niro) and the other is Jack Teller (Norton). Nick is the senior, 'been doing it too long', knows all the tricks, just about to retire guy but Jack is the young, up and coming, too smart for his own good, outgoing guy. Let's face it, this is a film aimed at males and males of different ages so each guy can relate to one of these two character in a way that reflects their life at the moment. Are they more elder? Close to retirement? Know all the tricks of their trade? Or are they more younger, more cocky, more outgoing types. Whatever the answer, the tactic on display here works really well in involving the audience.I liked a lot more things about The Score than I disliked and when I did dislike something, I ignored it as it was relatively minor. There is nothing really 'wrong' with the film, it just does what it's supposed to do but is it the heist film of the century and does it present us with the heist of the century within itself? Hell no.

Whilst at the very end of his career and therefore lowest ebb of his professional life, he still manages a performance that's above most other lesser actors' best.The cinematography is lovely to watch. The lighting in Nick's apartment fits the mood of this film perfectly. And the pacing is just right. All-in-all, all of the people involved did a wonderful job. It's a pleasure to watch.The story itself concerns a heist at the Montreal Customs House. Instigated by Edward Norton's character (Jack Teller), Robert De Nero's (Nick Wells) aging professional thief decides to take on One Last Job, despite that job containing some less-than-ideal risks (including it being located in his home town.) The story is ostensibly about Jack's wish to have one big score, Nick's desire to retire comfortably and live out the rest of his days as an ordinary businessman, and Jack and Nick's attempts to outdo one another. Thrown into the mix is Marlon Brando's (Max's) role as a fixer, putting one in contact with the other.The above plot points are, however, as in all good thrillers, merely MacGuffins. The real story lies in the interplay between the characters. Their various strengths, weaknesses and motivations are revealed as the story moves along towards its conclusion. Like all good anti-heroes, there's much to admire and to despise in each character. I particularly enjoyed the scenes between Jack and a rent-a-thug hired by Nick. It was very well done, and demonstrated both the toughness and the self-control of Edward Norton's character, Jack.I'd put this film in my top ten of all time across all genres.

To try to make up the loss, he gets a reluctant De Niro to finally agree to one last caper...one that would have a significant yield and put both of them on easy street. De Niro is tired of the game, and just wants to settle down, but he becomes convinced by the take that maybe he should go ahead and do this last job before he marries girlfriend Angela Bassett and settles in. He does not know about Ed Norton, who plays like a guy with Down's Syndrome as a ruse. De Niro sees through the game and gives Brando hell...even sends a hit man after Norton, who turns the game around during the supposed hit. Norton is flashy and undisciplined, De Niro is systematic and meticulous, and the clash begins. They overcome numerous obstacles in the planning and execution...but on the night of the heist, there is a double-cross. This is not, as I have heard some people report, clich√© ridden or even predictable, and the ending has a very nice touch to it. I would suggest you give the movie a whirl, even if only to see De Niro and Brando together in Brando's swan-song to the silver screen. It is entertaining, and has some very thrilling moments, enough to keep you engaged, especially during the heist. Also there is some nice jazz on the tracks and in the club. I won't mention the cats who got credit on the screen, but I will mention the ones who didn't. Backing the vocalist in her first screen number are well known New York City musicians Lewis Nash on drums, and Lonnie Plaxico on bass. I make it a point to give them mention because in the credits they named everyone...even the guys who swept the movie set...but not these two very fine musicians.

All of them are pretty intense and serious about their craft, yet non of them are used to their full potential. Brando sits around and shows up to chat up with DeNiro here and there and DeNiro himself doesn't make a very believable thief. He has that no nonsense attitude down, but we've seen that before when he was on the run from Pacino in Heat. Norton is given a little bit to work with as he plays two roles, the other is one of a mentally challenged cover act who works the place they plan to steal the scepter from. Norton is the one out of the three given the most interesting character with the biggest struggle. Frank Oz directs it with no special flare. It could have been anyone behind that lens and I wouldn't have cared. There was no stamp of originality or sense of ownership. It was pretty much like Deniro's character traits. Safe and simple. Nothing fancy, nothing risky. The scenes with suspense seem to be mildly interesting and you never feel the threat of danger. Oz was able to handle to 3 actors fine, but again, could have done so much more. I can't fault the script because that was the story going into it.

Set up by his long-time partner in crime (Marlon Brando), he must join forces with a young and cocky criminal (Edward Norton) on what proves to be a very difficult and problematic job.Sure, the plot has been done to death in other films, but it's the actors and the cinematography that carry the film. It may not be jam-packed full of surprises, but for the two hours the movie takes to get to it's point, it never loses any steam. All three actors -- and even Bassett, who is given limited screen-time -- are on fire. De Niro plays the part naturally, as always, while Brando is a blast, obviously having fun with the role and responsible for lightening the load from time to time. Edward Norton, as always, chats up and chews up the scenery in a role that is marginally over-shadowed by his older counterparts. The direction by Frank Oz -- who has directed a few duds in his time -- is surprising stylish and accomplished. Less about action and more about suspense and character development, The Score doesn't break any new ground. Rather, it's a classic story delivered with a phenomenal cast and a good visual sense.

The romance thing is thrown in for no reason; it doesn't even rise to the level of a subplot. The tension between the DeNiro and Brando characters is sketched in briefly, then left entirely unresolved.

He is a multitalented filmmaker, whose work ranges from voicing many of the Muppet characters to directing comedies like What About Bob, In & Out, Little Shop of Horrors, and Bowfinger. His style usually places the audience in the center of the action-we feel apart of what is happening on screen. The Score represents a distinct change of pace for Frank Oz. It's a serious, dramatic film, while his past work has been with comedies. This is a solid, professional attempt at a heist movie with many enticing sequences and riveting dialogue. Considering the potential involved, however, it isn't quite enough.	The Score was entirely filmed in Montreal, where the story also takes place. The movie's cast deserves some kind of grandeur; every main star owns some kind of award for their acting skills. Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, a longtime criminal who's ready to settle down with his girlfriend (Angela Bassett) and retire permanently. His dealer, Max (Marlon Brando), wants him to do one last job team up with a young but talented thief named Jack Teller (Edward Norton) and devise a heist to steal a prized artifact in Montreal's Customs House that is worth millions. The problem is that Nick works alone, and he would never consider doing a job in his home town.	De Niro and Norton make a fine pair, but who in their right mind would put Angela Bassett and Robert De Niro together as a romantic couple-Edward Norton and Marlon Brando make a better twosome. Brando himself contributes an effective performance, he doesn't have enough screen time to make a terrific impact, and he's often used as a plot device. The film's attempts to add personal dimension to Robert De Niro's character feel contrived. The story uses Nick's romantic interest to invoke internal struggles within himself. It doesn't work.	The Score is a smart movie that gradually builds tension and increases the stakes to keep us involved. I didn't understand most of the heist construction, I did believe the characters knew what they were doing. Most of the scenes involved with the heist are quite interesting. In the movie's best sequence-where Jack explains the circumstances involved with Montreal's Customs House-the visualization and dialogue work so well together it probably deserves a place among the year's best individual sequences.	I didn't care for the final twist at the end. I won't reveal anything about the actual turning point, but it comes too late in the film, and the story foreshadows it so clearly that most experienced moviegoers will see it coming a mile away. 	The Score contains an engaging amount of good material. In a summer filled with dreary motion pictures, this is clearly one of the best film's playing in theaters right now. That said, I am not sure the film is worth the high admission prices. I left with more questions than answers, and with a desire of something more from the plot.  The Score reveals its story over a large spectrum, but the story itself is too spread out over too many unnecessary plot contrivances. The film paints a convincing portrait of intelligence characters. But by the end, the characters are at the mercy of the plot. Nothing preconceived is permitted to happen, and that makes the characters puppets, not characters with minds of their own. That's the last thing we expect from talent like this.
