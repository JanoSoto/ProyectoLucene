The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too intelligent for a dumb movie like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances.

There is not a slow moment in the adventures of Harry and LLoyd, two great but incredibly unintelligent friends who decide to move to Aspen, Colorado to get out of their dead-end lives in Providence, Rhode Island. Jim Carrey delivers a side-splitting performance as Lloyd, the lovestruck limo driver who first suggested the trip to Aspen (We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF!!), mostly so that he can find Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the woman he fell in love with after he drove her to the airport in Providence.Lloyd's and Harry's adventures on their trip are absolutely hilarious to watch, especially their run-ins with the criminals who are chasing them, trying to get the briefcase that Harry and Lloyd do not know is full of ransom cash. One of the best things about this film is that it never strays too far from reality. There is never anything presented that could not possibly happen in real life. Also, the original and strikingly funny comedy that was written for the film is great! I can't remember ever laughing this hard at a movie.Dumb & Dumber takes a good story, adds some tear-inducing comedy, some endlessly hilarious dialogue (I guess they're right, old people, though slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose. Don't you go dyin' on me!), and needlessly good direction and molds one of the funniest films ever. Good for all ages, Dumb & Dumber is sheer unadulterated comedy and is destined to become a classic.

I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it, and the tenth time I saw it, and the hundredth time I saw it. This movie never gets old. There is not one single dull moment. The movie takes off and never lets up, not even enough to let you breathe. There is something absolutely mesmerizing and hilarious about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' performances as the lovable idiots Lloyd Christmas( Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels).The movie starts out in Providence, Rhode Island with two guys who are down on their luck. They've just lost their jobs, are late on the gas bill(again), and make the best of a bad situation by returning a briefcase they've recovered to its rightful owner, an attractive woman named Mary (Lauren Holly). And Lloyd(Carrey), has fallen madly in love with Mary after driving her to the airport. It just so happens that Mary lives all the way across the country, in Aspen, Colorado (or is it California?) Sure its crazy and stupid, but they've got nothing to lose, so they take off in their 84' sheepdog. And let's face it, if we were them, we'd go too.Dumb and Dumber was not pretentious, the actors never made you feel like they were in on the joke. No, they played it with a straight face the whole way through, and that's really the best way to do comedy. Even when they aren't speaking, their body language alone is enough to elicit huge laughs. The reactions and facial expressions are perfect.The film wasn't warmly received by a lot of critics, but only because they couldn't lower their snouts long enough to realize that this was not another movie about dumb guys, but really a film about earnest guys. And they are pathetically funny just being themselves. They play stupid games in the car to pass the time, and sing aloud to keep from getting bored, and have crazy dreams of one day opening up a worm store.The movie plays out with a high spirit and feel good attitude that can't be matched. And the soundtrack is perfect; it really sets the tone and never feels out of place.Really, truly, without a doubt, the best comedy ever made. I will treasure this movie forever, and even when I watch it the 101st time, I know it'll make me laugh... and laugh... and laugh till it hurts.The film is well paced and has a spontaneous nature that lacks in most comedies. Behind all the stupidness, there is a real glow of brilliance. The fact is, more than all the goofiness and crazy antics, Dumb and Dumber is a film full of smarts, and that's what we end up admiring the most.

Jerry Lewis. Every generation has their dose of silliness. The 1990s had Jim Carrey. And along with him came the phenomenal hit Dumb and Dumber, a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness.Our tale begins when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson (the gorgeous Lauren Holly, who Carrey eventually married and then divorced) to an airport. He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine, and after he has dropped her off, he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport. Rushing inside, he grabs the briefcase, only to find someone closing the gate to her plane. It's okay, I'm a limo driver! he yells to a ticket checker, rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it, falling onto the cement runway below.After retreating to his apartment, he convinces his pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary. Harry, the smarter one (or is that dumb-less one?), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off. Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her. Now with hitment on their tail, Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc.Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this. Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing. Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala, and stand at a bar in bright, tasteless suits. The way they stand, talk, and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies, two idiots without a clue.The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers, Peter and Bobby. You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious There's Something About Mary. But truth be told, Dumb and Dumber is even better than Mary. Whereas Mary was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes, Dumb and Dumber is a true comedic gem, and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste, something Mary crosses over and never turns back to.Is this movie dumb? Yes, absolutely. Will it offend you? Perhaps if you're a snob. And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here.I don't think it matters. This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully. In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as Me, Myself & Irene) - the difference here is that Dumb and Dumber manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.In the end, this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s stupid-comedy counterparts.

It's not perfect, which is why I didn't give it a perfect score. It has a flew flaws that some movie critics would pick at.

It takes you on a tour of the lives of Harry and Lloyd; two guys in Rhode Island who are going nowhere in life. Once Lloyd finds the love of his life, he obsesses over her and even gets involved further in her life then he should have. She leaves an empty suit case at the airport and the content in it is very valuable. Lloyd grabs it and thinks she forgot it and wants to give it back to her but it's too late, she flew all the way to Aspen. So, Lloyd wants to go on a road trip with his buddy Harry and drive all the way to Aspen to return it to her. Little do they know that kidnappers and the FBI are after them. On their way they encounter several crazy and memorable characters. Seabass the tough redneck, Mental a somewhat stupid hit man and many more.The acting is very hilarious and well done. Jim Carrey does a great job at Lloyd who is so damn stupid and hilarious, it's hard not to like him. This character is one of Carrey's best. Jeff Daniels does and equally good job as Harry who is less dumb then Lloyd but still gets into plenty of trouble. The story overall is a road ride in the eyes of two likable idiots who are oblivious to everything and yet, they still manage to get out of trouble without even trying. The dialog in the movie is very funny and memorable. Several scenes are equally as memorable. Lloyd's fantasy dream for instance with his so called love Mary, Harry's explosive diarrhea, The cop drinking the pee out of the beer bottles, the Seabass scenes, the blind kid pretty bird scene, the Don't worry, I'm a Limo driver scene and several more.

This is realism of a sort In general, incompetent fools do not excel in life, and they don't excel in here. The guy does not end up with the girl, the protagonists don't end up successful or particularly happy except in their friendship.This gives the comedy so much more impact. If everyone and the world are believable, ridiculous antics really stick out. My favorite scene in this movie, for example, is Harry and Lloyd's interaction with a very serious, tough thug. The thug's realistically confused and shocked response to their pure idiocy makes the idiocy itself far more potent and gut-wrenchingly hilarious.The plot, while not particularly deep, acts as a sort of clever satire on most comedy-adventures. As I said, the heroes actually end up any better off than they started, but their blissful ignorance makes it hard for you to feel sad for them.There are two distinct reasons that this comedy stands the test of multiple views, though. One is the physical, comedic performances of Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey as Harry and Lloyd. So brilliantly over-the-top and obnoxious, you'll be laughing almost non-stop if you just pay attention to the way the two stars act. The other is how creatively stupid Harry and Lloyd are. It's clear someone of great intelligence wrote this stupid script; the jokes are clever and come at a nonstop pace.There are the requisite bodily function jokes, but they don't really drag the movie down very much, as they are sparse and generally funny.

He's always very aware of where each point of his body is located, what what his face is doing. That might seem like a strange thing to say but an expression or stance or way of performing an action can make a big difference to a scene. There's a particular scene after he gets mugged by an old lady where he bursts through the door and crumples to the ground in agony. It's a small thing but I can't imagine any other actor performing the scene in that way, and there's plenty of other scenes where Carrey's unique physicality shines through.Jeff Daniels is suitably goofy in his role, and probably gets the biggest laugh with the toilet scene, which is crude and silly but very funny.I don't think Carrey or the Farrelly Brothers ever recaptured the greatness of this movie unfortunately.

No cars were wrecked in the making of this film, unlike Tommy Boy, and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. In fact, it might not even qualify as a road trip comedy since at least thirty-five minutes of it are spent at the destination of Aspen, Colorado. It has kind of a story to it, but primarily it just takes some everyday situations and puts them into comedy format.The movie introduces another dynamic comedy duo to join the ranks. You can tell that Harry and Lloyd are good friends, but they also have distinct personalities. This is highlighted by the balance of screen time that they have together and separate. Lloyd is a little bit goofier and more adventurous than the somewhat irritable and nervous Harry. Both parts receive good, arguably spectacular, performances. Despite how the film is titled, the two are not as stupid as one might think. They show that they are resourceful in a number of situations, though there does seem to be some part of their brains that have something missing. Their stupidity is almost paradoxical, because they know how to drive and make some kind of money, but there's just certain things that they don't really get like Christmas as in the holiday?- No Christmas as in tree. There are various minor characters that drive the plot along. These consist of the scattered cops, the guy and girl that chase Harry and Lloyd, and Mary Swanson. The plot is nothing special, but it's also not the main focus of the movie and can be absorbed in a variety of ways and at a variety of levels. The whole story behind the suitcase is kind of funny in itself because it's such a serious thing, but it get's inadvertently messed up by the unsuspecting and innocent Harry and Lloyd. Each part is acted pretty well, though you could make a case against the quality of the script.There is a pretty good balance of verbal and situational comedy. I got more of a bang of the verbal comedy, which primarily came before arriving in Aspen. A lot of the situational humor comes from the minor characters overestimating Harry and Lloyd's intelligence and getting outwitted, sometimes unintentionally. The humor isn't outrageously crude or raunchy, though it is rated PG-13 for a reason.If you enjoy Jim Carrey movies, this fits the bill, and he gives a performance that is on par with his other work. It's pretty good if you like slapstick, though the overall feel doesn't quite spell slapstick. I guess you could say it's kind of in it's own genre. But watch it for laughs and if you don't like it, there's no fault in that- apart from maybe being a little too smart for this movie. Overall Rating 8.2/10.

While soon after the initial release of the film, the audience and critic response wasn't very good at all. Having been played on television for roughly fifteen years now, the fan base and the overall grade of the film has drastically went upwards. I remember in the 1990s often seeing this film on television and watching it many many times. There was no watching it too much. The film flows so naturally and in my opinion there is never a dull scene, not a single one. The following is my review of Dumb and Dumber.The film was written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly, and Bennett Yellin. The Farrelly Brothers are also known for other hilarious films such as There's Something About Mary, and Me, Myself & Irene. This story follows two friends Harry(Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd(Jim Carrey) as they travel across country from Rhode Island to Aspen, Colorado where Lloyd returns a briefcase that a customer left in Lloyd's limousine he was driving. The silly happenings that occur on the way to Aspen are downright hilarious. This movie has so many quotable lines, that it was difficult to pick my favorite for the summary of my review. As I said in my first paragraph, this film flows smoothly, never a dull moment, never a moment when you ask yourself where are the laughs at?. This film is non stop comedy and just an overall amazing joyride to watch. I sat down to watch the film again because they are finally making a true sequel to this amazing film. I've watched this film so many times over the years(easily 300 times if I had to put a number on it) and I can honestly say I still never get bored with this film. After 20 years that says a great deal about a film if it can have that effect on you. The Farrelly Brothers delivered a fabulous comedy on their first outing, and a film I will never forget.The film was also directed by The Farrelly Brothers. This was the Farrelly Brothers first outing directing a film, they had written some things in the past, but never directed. This duo was unstoppable in the 1990s, with not only this film but several others as well. The film was not very easy to get off the ground, and it actually took a few years because studios thought the script was garbage and that it would never sell. New Line Cinema came along and gave the film a chance, although still worried about the idea. The studio gave the directors a list of 25 actors who they wanted to see cast as Harry and Lloyd, but all of the actors said no. Finally, they went to Jim Carrey to ask about the role of Lloyd, and he did accept the role, but it wasn't until after his wildly popular Ace Ventura film was released, thus giving him much more money. They wanted someone a little less unknown for the other role of Harry and someone who could play nicely off of Carrey. In came Jeff Daniels, who is such a fantastic actor. Daniels was worried abut Carrey stealing the show, but then after reading the script realized that Harry is just as important as Lloyd if not more so. The rest is history, and we are left with two amazing performances from Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. They did in fact get along so much together, and made the film that much better. It is even said that Carrey ad libbed a great deal of his famous lines. For young first time directors to allow their cast to do this and have fun with the roles made the film that much better. The Farrelly Brothers set out to deliver fans some great laughs, and in the end turned out one of the greatest comedies ever made. Not many first time directors can say that.The soundtrack on this film is so amazing as well. Times have of coursed changed in the 20 years since the film first was released, but looking back hearing those great songs from artists like Apache Indian, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, The Proclaimers, Echobelly, and of course Crash Test Dummies is such a joy. The soundtrack added so much to this comedy classic, and should not be overlooked.In closing, Dumb and Dumber set out to deliver some laughs, but little did the Farrelly Brother know that their first feature length film would become so widely popular and known as a true comedy classic. Fans who want to get back to roots of real comedy instead of the phony comedy being pushed today, this is a fantastic film to start with. The comedy is witty and subtle, which even makes you stop and think at times. The joy this film will bring you is nearly unparalleled in this comedy genre. With the newest and first real sequel to the original Dumb and Dumber film set to release within hours of me writing this review, it is a must to see this classic film before going out to watch the sequel.10/10 "},{"Title":"No matter how many times you watch it, it's still funny","Date":"11 November 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The Farrelly Brothers' 1994 road-comedy about buddies Carrey and Daniels (who make a surprisingly perfect duo of morons) travelling from Providence to Aspen and the troubles their dimwittedness brings them.

This may well have been the movie Carrey was building up to since the first Ace Ventura movie and, to that extent, is no great surprise on his CV. For Daniels, however, this movie is completely out of left field, and he is absolutely brilliant.It is tempting to go on and explain why this is so, but there is a much better solution - go and watch the movie!

Holley leaves a briefcase at the airport and Jim Carrey is determined to get it back to her. He convinces Jeff Daniels to travel with him to Aspen, Colorado, to bring the briefcase back to Holley.What is terrific about this film is that unlike some other inferior buddy comedies, the two main characters are distinguishable from each other. Jim Carrey is the really dumb character, while Daniels plays the more practical dumb buddy and something of a straight character. The jokes and slapstick comedy in this film are second to none and what really allows this film to work is the fact that neither of these two guys have any idea how ridiculous their behavior is.

Lloyd's best friend and companion is Harry Dunn, played by Jeff Daniels, in which like Lloyd, Harry is a loser in his own way. The scruffy hair buddy drives dogs on the way to the dog shows for which his van is detail of one like a dog with giant ears on the side.

Jeff Daniels took me by surprise where instead of playing a normal guy in such films as Speed and Arachnophobia, he shows that he can place his acting chops into comedy.

Surely AFI would not want to put this one in the high-caliber humor hits in the history of movies. Still, Dumb and Dumber is one of the funnest comedies of the last 20 years. We meet Lloyd (Jim Carey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). Both are inept, moronic imbeciles who plan to own a pet store called I Got Worms. Good luck not only on raising the money, but even more on getting the loan. In any case, both have their odd jobs to get them through. Lloyd's life changes when he drives a woman, Mary (Lauren Holly), to the airport in his limousine, and she forgets her luggage. He decides to take it to her in Aspen, Colorado with the help of Harry. However, the luggage is actually ransom money for her husband. Harry and Lloyd have no idea, but they could really use the money since they have so little. They eventually discover it trying to find Mary, and on their tail are the kidnappers. It reminded me of a Three Stooges, Marx Brothers, or Abbot and Costello movie. However, with these guys, there is no straight man, nor any intelligence. This paves the way for idiotic miscarriages of common sense. Simply put, the audience will laugh because we can be assured that our intelligence is superior. This one also started the gross-out comedy. Looking back, the gross-outs in this one were not over-the-top. They were simple and much more plausible situations. Again, we can laugh because it is not us. There are no breakout performances, nor deft screen writing. Another strength for the movie is that it could work for kids as well as adults. Both ages can have fun with this movie--which is what I often watch on a snow day. Finally, let it be known that truth in stranger than fiction. I knew a guy in graduate school named Mike. In college I knew a guy named Jim. Put them together, you have Dumb and Dumber. However, I think they would have been smart enough to get on the bus at the end.

Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two very dimwitted individuals who live in Providence, Rhode Island. Lloyd is a taxi driver, and one day, he drives a young woman from Aspen, Colorado named Mary Swanson to the airport, immediately developing a crush on her. As Mary leaves for the flight, Lloyd sees that she has left a suitcase behind. Thinking she left it there accidentally, he attempts to get it back to her before the plane takes off, but is too late. After he and Harry lose their jobs on the same day, he convinces his friend to come on a long road trip to Aspen to return Mary's suitcase to her. However, what these two idiots don't realize is that Mary left that suitcase behind for a reason, and during their trip, they also don't realize that two criminals are following them! The Farrellys are known to make extremely silly, sick, raunchy movies, filled with toilet humour, slapstick, and sex jokes. Dumb & Dumber shows that it was like that from the beginning. The filth in this movie (along with the other movies from the Farrelly brothers) is obviously hated by some people, and those people should definitely avoid this movie at all costs! However, although the kind of humour that comes from the minds of the Farrelly brothers and other demented minds in the comedy business isn't for everyone, some people like it a lot. While Dumb & Dumber may not be an absolutely perfect film for those who have a sick sense of humour (like me), and like the kind of crude jokes that the Farrellys love to use, I would say it's well worth a look.

It's not hard to see why Dumb and Dumber (as well as Ace Ventura and The Mask) made the great Jim Carrey a superstar. I wish I saw Jeff Daniels in more comedic roles since he stars in more dramatic roles though. I just wished that they had never made the awful prequel or sequel. They should've just leaved the comedy classic the way it is. PS Happy April Fool's Day!

And there are a few noticeable continuity errors.Nevertheless, it all comes together somehow, along with some spectacular (or just plain goofy, I'm not sure) acting, to deliver one of the best comedies of all time.

Standout performances by both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. The chemistry between these two is unmatched, and the chemistry is simply the icing on the cake for this movie. The performances by both Carrey & Daniels is so natural, silly, hilarious & memorable it is as if these two simply pulled a weeks worth of self-documented video tape of their journeys and experiences and made it into a movie. Though far-fetched from a typical road trip, the casualness and comfort of the performances these two immerse yourself in make you feel as though these two could easily be your quarky neighbors you have always wondered about. One of the only movies I have personally watched over a dozen times, and knowing I'm not alone, I know the vast majority of the one-liners and jokes throughout this whole movie. Numerous classic scenes that have been imitated and improvised over the years by thousands of teenagers, adolescences and adults.

It never gets old and it still holds up to this day. Dumber & Dumber also happens to be in my top five comedies. Ever. It's well titled film and for the film's purpose, it succeeds. It's a stupid movie and it knows it is, and that's why it's so great. First of all the two leads are charming, despite their child-like nature and lack of common sense. Jim Carrey, as Jeff Daniels once put it, is a tornado of comedic wit and timing. Speaking of Jeff Daniels, his character Harry is very good contrast to Jim Carrey's character Lloyd. Carrey is energetic and it's a performance full of power, while Daniels is a bit more mellow and a teeny tiny bit smarter than Lloyd, just a little bit and plays off Carrey, which works well because he's not competing with his performance against Jim, he's just following along. They play off each other very well, and it's just damn funny. The plot is pretty basic and simple, but it's the situations they get into that are real gold. Granted I haven't seen every movie out there or every comedy movie ever made, but with that being said, there are only a couple of films that have made me laugh with tears coming out of my eyes, and there are, not just one, or two but three moments that do exactly that, one of them is the infamous scene toilet scene. The film slightly drags near the ending and gets a bit dull, but the supporting cast is good, including Lauren Holly who plays Mary Sawnson, the love interest of both Lloyd and Harry, mainly Lloyd who considered her the love of his life after he drives her to the airport as his job as a limo driver. She is the reason why the dimwits decide to take a road trip to see her after she purposefully leaves her briefcase at the airport. Mike Starr is also a bright spot and has humorous moments with Carrey and Daniels. I firmly believe this film is a comedic gem and absolutely deserves to in the Hall of Fame of all time great comedies or at least be mentioned or in the conversation. For film to be this stupid, but to also be so funny with all the gags clicking and everything firing in right cylinders, it is impossible to resist.

The humor is strictly of the adolescent, simple-minded, scatological variety, with pratfalls galore. Nevertheless, you'll your sphincter will dilate because you'll laugh so hard at this farcical inanity that you'll have a bowel movement. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels topline as the eponymous morons on a road-trip from Rhode Island to Colorado to deliver an abandoned attaché case crammed with loot that cute heroine Lauren Holly left deliberately behind at the airport on her way to Aspen. When goofy limo driver Carrey does a good deed by latching onto the luggage that the girl of his dreams tried to hand off inconspicuously at the airport terminal, hi-jinks ensue with our harebrained heroes struggling to get the luggage back to her. What our clueless cretins don't comprehend is that she deliberately abandoned the luggage stuffed with $100-thousand dollars to ransom her abducted husband. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey of the Ace Ventura movies) drives a limbo at the outset out and doesn't know the difference between a babe from Austria, much less Australia, and surmises that she is from New Jersey. This woebegone wiseacre is pals with a dog groomer who has converted his ride into the biggest sight gag in the movie. Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels of Gettysburg) shares the same dream with Lloyd about embarking as entrepreneurs in the business of worm farming. I've got worms, Lloyd gleefully informs his horrified limo customer, Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), about his aspirations. Meantime, two thoroughly reprehensible thugs trail them across country. Joe Mentalino (Mike Starr of Clockers) and J.P. Shay (Karen Duffy of Reality Bites) are the ruffians in pursuit. Joe suffers from an ulcer, and he lacks a shred of sympathy. After Shay and he break into Harry's apartment to retrieve the valise, Joe twists the head off Harry's pet parakeet Petey. Nevertheless, our heroes manage to eliminate them without realizing the hellacious trouble that they are in. Joe decides to masquerade as a man whose car has broken down on the highway so he can hitch a ride with them. He goes more than he bargained for in the process. The scene at restaurant later on concludes with his demise as the consequence of a prank that Lloyd and Harry play on him. The sight gags are terrific, especially the headlights and Harry's mutt truck, with Carrey and Daniels doing their best 'two stooges' act, and the Farrellys doling out irreverent as well as uneven politically-incorrect humor. The scene when Harry urinates on Lloyd while they are cruising up to Aspen in freezing weather is amusing because like everything else in Dumb and Dumber is about incongruity. Our heroes make Forrest Gump look like Albert Einstein. The prequel that followed not long afterward was amusing but it flopped. A belated but side-splitting sequel surfaced 20 years later, with Carrey and Daniels reprising their roles respectively as Lloyd and Harry. The labored gag when Lloyd has to relieved himself with nowhere else to go than a collection of beer bottles and a cop stops them and decides to sample one of their open container is funny, too. To their credit neither actor behave like everything that they are doing is amusing, and Carrey took the cap off one of his front teeth for comic effect. Mind you, this isn't the Farrelly Brothers' best work, but you can see the seeds of their future.

DUMB AND DUMBER is obviously a pretty dumb movie with one dumb thing after another happening but it's also one of the smartest comedies in the past few decades. I think anyone could have made a movie about dumb people as they do it all the time but the writing here was just so perfect that you can't help but be drawn into Lloyd and Harry's world as they get into one problem after another. A large portion of the credit has to go to Carrey and Daniels for delivering two excellent performances. It's not easy playing dumb but these two do it so well that it would be impossible for any other actors to fit these roles. Carrey, the maniac, does a very good job at playing Lloyd for this moron who never knows when to give up. Daniels, I think the smarter of the two, manages to sometimes be ahead of his friend but the way the actor plays almost like a big brother was extremely fun. The two of them have perfect chemistry together and the majority of the jokes wouldn't work if they hadn't, one, nailed their performances and two, worked so well together. Holly does a good job looking pretty and playing it straight to the two idiots but I think Mike Starr is the one who gets overlooked. He's a wonderful character actor and has put his stamp on many great films but the comic timing here was just perfect and the scenes with him and boys are priceless and among the best in the picture. The one flaw with the picture is that it does run a bit too long and especially in its uncut version. These extra jokes really don't add enough to the film to warrant them be included.

It still is a very popular movie (at the time of writing, being the mid to late nineties) and I do think that it is quite funny. Dumb and Dumber seems to be a movie that you either love or you hate. I enjoy it and at some points in this movie I actually find it quite funny.A young lady named Mary Swanson is picked up by Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carey) and taken to the airport. Lloyd falls in love with her and treats her as a long lost friend. Mary has other things on her mind, such as her kidnapped husband and the ransom. She leaves a brief case of money in the airport but Lloyd sees it, thinks that she has left it behind, and rushes up and takes it before the crooks can lay their hands on it.The crooks then try to get the money back while Christmas and his friend decide to travel across America to Aspen to find Mary Swanson and return the money to her. Thus Dumb and Dumber becomes a road movie, though quite a funny one. They set the jokes up quite well and then execute them even better. The comedy is a mix of slapstick and toilet humour, with some dumb jokes thrown it.The main characters are simply idiots. They do not think about what they do, but more so they say things that we consider to be really stupid. Then there is the comedy of ignorance. The two idiots don't realise that they have stumbled into a kidnapping case and the crims think that the idiots are FBI agents who are constantly one step ahead.I consider that Dumb and Dumber is a very clever movie that is thematically dry. It is a plot driven movie and was made for laughs and money. I guess that it emphasises the stupid side of us and in a way we are laughing at ourselves. It is a movie that takes our stupid side and over inflates it. Things such as the dead parakeet being sold to the blind boy. It is not something that we would expect to happen, but it shows up the side of us that wants to rip off those who are less fortunate. There is the scene where Lloyd meets Mary and instantly falls in love with her. Though this is blown out of proportion, it reveals to us the way we will fall in love with people that we do not know.It also reveals the side of us that makes unsupported assumptions. Such as the crooks thinking that Carey and Daniels are very sophisticated and intelligent private detectives or FBI agents, when we know that they are really just a couple of twits. This shows us up as we tend to jump to illogical conclusions and they do tend to be the opposite.I really enjoy this movie. It is funny, witty, and quite smooth.

But you are surely the one person who has made a mistake if you've watched this film and disliked it without realising it's called Dumb and Dumber?. I will TRY and keep this brief (impossible), but this is one of my all-time favourite films and for good reason. The same way I have given Lord of the Rings the title of my favourite fantasy adventure movie, Star Wars the Sci-Fi favourite, and so on and so on, is the same way I put this among my top-ten of comedies ever. The duo of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels is one of the best comedy match-ups since John Candy and Steve Martin. Both are dumb as each other in equally dumb ways but this truly is NOT a dumb movie. It's heart-warming, ridiculous and it's a proper journey of friendship and male-bonding. I won't go into the plot, but imagine the best road trip you could ever go on with your best mate, filled with memories you will never soon forget (for better or worse). THAT is this film.The comedic timing is perfect. The choreography captures the scenery beautifully as they trawl from Rhode Island to Aspen, and I don't think the Farrelly brothers have ever made a film as great as this. I mean, the humour is perfect. The crass and gross moments aren't tastelessly done like in something like American Pie or some teen flick, this is smart yet incredibly thick! If you don't cry laughing at the kind of scrapes these two get themselves into, you've dislocated your funny bone. And serious applause is due to Daniels who isn't overshadowed by Carrey. As a big Carrey fan, I've never found anyone as funny or able to pull off dumb and wacky humour the way he is, but Daniels is the only person I've ever seen who works in perfect harmony with him, and with Jim being the big man of comedy himself, that is no easy feat. Daniels, I truly commend you for that. He confessed he never did a film like this, ever.

This is a hysterical movie.The best thing about this movie is that it starts funny and keeps the laughs coming for the duration of the movie. I often find that comedy movies will have a few funny bits (which usually feature in the promotional clip) and very little else.While the humour in Dumb and Dumber is always in pretty bad taste, it is very hard not to laugh. The best parts of the movie for me were the restaurant scene which turns into a bloodthirsty kung fu fight and the scene where Harry and Mary are playing in the snow together and decide to make a snowman. There are plenty of other highlights - for example eating chilli dogs with the hit-man, the collection of outfits Lloyd and Harry wear, particularly to the fund raising event.One interesting aspect of the movie is that it does not make any attempt to teach any sort of moral. Often humorous movies will try to teach a moral, maybe in some vain attempt by the director to justify having made the movie in the first place. However no such attempt is made in Dumb and Dumber - the two central characters start the movie as shallow, bitter weirdo's and that is exactly how they finish up.

At least... we thought we wanted an unrated version. The problem is, the original was consider a classic in its day, that adding six more minutes of footage (sprinkeled around a number of scenes) really breaks up the almost-brilliant pacing that fans loved from the original film. The footage added also makes this basically an R-rated film now, with what we would call strong sexuality (without given away the jokes. It was nice to see the extra footage, even if it is a little more risqué, but the original PG-13 rating really suits the movie better (and younger teens can watch it without hearing jokes that parents think are too strong). Missing is any kind of audio commentary, and the complete absence of Jim Carrey in the bonus material is rather strange. Swartzenegger was available for the bonus' in the first Conan movie when it got re-released on DVD, so why didn't the studio at least try to wait for Carrey to have some free time. If you're a fan like me, and can almost recite EVERY line from memory, seeing this Uncut Version will be a nice treat, especially when it come to the extras (though everything fits on only 1 disc, so we don't get a whole lot of content). I liked seeing the extra footage, but as soon as I finished this new version, I went online and bought the original PG-13 DVD -- because that's the film that I loved and memorized years ago. Extra footage is nice, and a few sections of the Deleated Scenes are really funny, but they really did leave the funniest stuff in the original version. Still, buy this version for the extras, but buy the original on DVD as well. That's the version that will always be a classic, no matter how much time passes.

There aren't many movies that can make your ribs hurt from laughing, and it takes a certain subtlety in the comedy to push you over the edge into histerics, but that is exactly what you have in Dumb and Dumber. There were some parts that I had to rewind and watch again half a dozen times just to salvage the subtlety of Carrey's hilarious delivery. Carrey is certainly the focal point of the movie. The plot and his character's side-kick are really just props that Carrey uses to bring about painful laughter in anyone watching, (and I'm sure he is responsible for thousands of people choking on their drink whilst watching this movie). The two main characters in the movie are losers living together with an ambition to save up and start a pet store selling worm-farms. The tongue-in-cheek sentimental scene with Carrey and his friend talking about whether to go to Aspen and return a briefcase to a girl or not is hilarious as Carrey's friend shouts, I say we just find some work and scrape together the cash to start up the worm store, (I'm sure it was Carrey that was responsible for the idea of the two character's enterprise being in selling worm farms). Carrey's character says to a woman he is attracted to being driven in his taxi/limo I've got worms. Only afterwards does he explain that that will be the name of his and his pal's pet store. Another hilarious scene is the dream sequence in which Carrey's loser character fantasises and imagines the girl really liking him. He fights waiters as one of them started kissing the girl's arm, and Carrey uses a kung-fu set that made my ribs hurt with laughter. One of the best things about Jim Carrey's comedy is that he seems to be an expert in a number of areas, probably having carefully practiced for years to get his art to where it is here, and he also always has an intelligence about his work, making use of cliché hyperbolically at times in just the right way and often using a very classical style that is truly mastered.

Coming right on the back of Ace Ventura Pet Detective and The Mask came this comic masterpiece. Dumb & Dumber tells the story of Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels), two idiots from Providence, Rhode Island, who get caught up in a cross-country kidnapping plot after Lloyd falls in love. Lloyd is a more down-to-earth character than those Carrey played in his previous two movies, but still posses the same slightly manic, almost childlike humour for which Carrey was now world famous. I found 'loveable loser' Lloyd Christmas a much more endearing and engaging character than Ace Ventura. Additionally, Dumb & Dumber was more story-driven and was instrumental in Carrey's development as a character actor, rather than just a comic-actor. Though Carrey was the star of the movie for most people, it would be hugely unfair to allow him to overshadow what was an excellent performance from Jeff Daniels. Proving his versatility as an actor, Daniels, who normally plays fairly serious or family roles, showed what a good comic actor he could be. Though Harry was by no means the straight-guy, his more laid back character, and occasional moment of clarity was just enough to keep their adventure on the road. Easily one of the best comedies of the nineties and, in my opinion, definitely Jim Carrey's best film of that decade.My favourite moment When Lloyd attempts to board a plane that isn't there and spirals off the end of the skyway.My favourite quote The first time I set eyes on Mary Swanson, I just got that old fashioned romantic feeling...where I'd do anything to bone her.Worth a mention The late Joe Baker as Bernard.

Sticky Fingers didn't have Jim Carrey, therefore Dumb and Dumber is 100 times better. Why should they feel bad about making a movie better than one that was very similar in plot? They just did a better. Suck it!

Of course, Carrey does not know this and thinks she left the briefcase by accident so he takes the money unwittingly. Carrey also has an obsession with Holly to complicate manners. Throughout Carrey and Daniels dominate the action and the strangest coincidences occur as the bad guys think that Carrey and Daniels are after them and the good guys try to figure out the duo's connection with the kidnappers.

The Farrelly Brothers are talented writer/directors who have made several funny flicks like Kingpin, There's Something About Mary and Stuck on You. Though Dumb and Dumber is probably second to Mary as far as popularity goes, I think it's one of their lesser flicks. The Farrellys are partially to blame, but I place most of the blame on Jim Carrey. Whoever decided this moron should be paid $25 million a movie should be shot in the head. Jeff Daniels, though less experienced in comedy, gives a much performance in my opinion. Unlike Carrey, he doesn't use the over-the-top, anything-for-a-laugh approach. Instead, he's more concerned with being true to the character. Why does Carrey have to do some goofy eye movement or vocal intonation with every line of dialogue he utters? I always say that the rule of comedy is to act normal in ridiculous situations. In Carrey's case, he prefers to act ridiculous in ridiculous situations. How anyone over the age of 10 can laugh uproariously at a fool like him is beyond me. The film contains its share of funny gags (like the famous toilet scene), but most of them are disgusting or stupid or a mixture of both. One of the most annoying scenes is one where Carrey and Daniels both eat these hot chili peppers. Their mouths start burning, so they squirt ketchup and mustard all over the place, trying to get some into their mouths. And of course, there are other gag-inducing moments, like a man hocking a loogie into someone's burger. I suggest that if you're over the age of 10 and not a sucker for Carrey's incessant mugging, you stay away from this flick. It's simply another overrated comedy.

Lloyd and Harry lose their jobs, but Lloyd recovers a suitcase which Mary Swanson left behind at the airport as she departed for Aspen. It turns out this suitcase holds ransom for her husband, and two hit men follow Lloyd as he and Harry travel to Aspen to recover the ransom, thinking the two of them are masterminds (a big laugh).To give you an idea about the comedy in this film here are some examples - Lloyd knows the most annoying sound in the world, Harry has to ask if BOTH skis belong to a woman he meets, a police officer drinks from a beer bottle which Lloyd has urinated in, and the list goes on like that.If you allow yourself to not expect greatness from this film, you will probably find yourself enjoying it.

The plot is not the greatest but the acting and comedy makes up for it. With comet being my favourite genre, I struggle to think of a single film that compares to this genius piece of cinema. The soundtrack is also massively enjoyable and the supporting actors contribute towards the humour. And like all great comedy films, the amount of quotable lines are endless.

Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight (though not for lack of trying). Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog (to promote his failing dog-grooming business), and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. Incidentally, Lloyd's chipped front tooth happens to be real; while Jim Carrey had the injured tooth capped many years ago, he thought a broken smile would suit Lloyd's character and had the cap removed for the duration of filming. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi "},{"Title":"Funny & Funnier","Date":"26 October 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is Farrelly brothers' first and possibly best hit.

The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film.

That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect ride. The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a straight-man (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs.This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the cool in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of cool supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy buddy movies!

The plot is good. Them setting off on a big adventure to give a lady in Aspen back her suitcase. And along the way funny things happen! The direction is excellent and the script is well written. Sure, two idiots setting out on a big adventure. Who doesn't like that? Everyone will love it. Kids, adults and old people in Nursing Homes will love it. I recommend this to any human being. 10/10 "},{"Title":"A cracking comedy road movie","Date":"2 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Dumb and Dumber is the kind of film that only gets better each time you watch it. It charts the events of 2 broke friends Harry Dunn (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) along a journey to Aspen, to return a young ladies' luggage. It isn't a fantastic movie, nor is it wonderfully profound.  It lets you relax into the story, keeps you intrigued by the characters and shapes the story, with the help of a superb soundtrack, in a way that exuberates warmth. Dumb actions and dumb gags might be a turn off for some critic types, but I bet when they started watching it, they can't turn it off. In my view it is one of the best from the Farrelly Brothers.

It doesn't mater how many times you view this film, you still find it hilarious; simply because you see something new every time you watch it.I'd like to say the acting is superb, but I can't help thinking that the rolls weren't exactly much of a stretch on either Daniels of Carey. They both just seemed to by playing themselves, thats how naturally they've taken to the parts of the two buffoons, Harry and Loyd.The humor in this film is deliciously crude and wickedly entertaining. Think of Loyd igniting his flatulence, or the traffic cop drinking urine from beer bottles. The movie also contains what I believe to be one of the funniest simple and understated shots of all time; Harry sitting in a mood at the side of the road with just a hint of backside cleavage showing - side splittingly funny!If you don't like slapstick and crude jokes then your opinion may be slightly different, but if we're all honest with ourselves its slapstick and crude jokes that really makes you laugh out loud. Think of it this way when you watch The Simpsons you find the witty gags and satirical humor amusing, but when Homer hits his head on a low door frame, thats when you physically laugh.A hugely entertaing comedy with a laugh every minute and no emotional baggage.

This movie set the stage for their later work - full of crude humor and gross-out sight gags, yet with a good heart behind it. And while it's not quite as much as a fall-down laugh fest as Mary, it's still well worth your time. The plot involves a complete idiot named Lloyd (Jim Carrey) who spends his days as a limo driver, until he gets fired for pulling a hit and run. But, you see, it was the good-kind, because he was attempting to return a lost briefcase to a passenger of his named Mary. (Lauren Holly) Thankfully, he's not the only one out of a job. His best friend and roomate Harry has been fired from his job as a dog trimmer. What p***es him off is that he spent his life savings turning his car into a dog. With no money, no job, and nowhere to be, the two decide to pack it up and move to Aspen to return Mary's briefcase. Little do they know that her lost briefcase is actually pay-off for a ransom on her husband, and by taking the briefcase, they have a very powerful crime circuit on their tail.Warning - this movie is not for the faint of heart or those turned off by crude humor. To prove my point - one of the funniest jokes in the movie involves a decapitated parakeet. And the intellegence level is downhill from there. But, the important thing is that this movie is funny. At times it's flat-out hilarious. It's a high-speed, low-brow romp through a film that would herald in a new era in comedies.

I never knew that such a semi-serious actor like Jeff Daniels could be so stupid, and it amazed me on how well he played the part. This movie is so ridiculously unintelligent and unrealistic, but that is exactly what makes it so hilarious. I laughed more during this movie than I usually laugh in a month. My side hurt terribly at the end and I couldn't get it to stop.One of the scenes that really got my attention was quite possibly the stupidest scene of the film, at that would be the resteraunt scene that Lloyd imagines. This particular scene (along with the ones that followed) was so stupid that it made me feel like I didn't know why I was watching this trash, but it was amazingly funny. Another scene that grabs me is the burger/pepper scene, particularly at the end when Lloyd uses the phrase check, please (that line was so perfectly placed that I still laugh when I think about it).This movie amused me more than any other movie. It is literally the most hilarious film I have ever seen, but I wouldn't recommend it to the easily offended type.

I can remember tears coming down my cheeks when I watched Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush. That same thing has happened in not nearly enough other comedies I've seen over the years. It's happened every time I've watched Dumb and Dumber. What a great way to end the first century of film-making. D and D will endure like all the great comedies before. Dumb and Dumber is well written and well acted. I can't say that I condone the spirit of crassness that defines so much of our present culture. I think we've suffered as a culture for giving in to cheap laughs too often. There are definitely elements of that in Dumb and Dumber but it transcends even those. There are moments of sheer brilliance both in writing and performance. The timing of many of the gags was also a major driving force.

The jokes are low-brow and tasteless (it manages to squeeze in not one, but two urination sight gags) and the story is a bit of flimsy about a kidnaping gone awry.The only thing that could redeem such an offensive picture is if it was funny.  Thankfully, all us low-brow fans can sit back and laugh, because Dumb and Dumber is hysterical.  It's not for everyone -- this is no Kind Hearts and Coronets -- but if you like a good laxative joke (and who doesn't?), Dumb and Dumber delivers.Jim Carrey is Lloyd Christmas, a limo driver who tries to pick up girls by climbing into the backseat at stop signs and pretending to be the passenger. His pal is Harry (Jeff Daniels), a dog groomer who spent his life savings converting his van into a furry pooch.  When they both get fired the same day, they decide to drive the pooch west from Rhode Island to Colorado (never mind why).What comes next are a couple thousand miles of jokes about pee-pee, poo-poo, varieties of phlegm, ulcers, rat poison, vicious assault, hideous fashion and the decimation of 1/7th of an endangered species by champagne cork.Nonetheless for all their stupid, tasteless crudeness (and the movie never lets up) there is a sweet spirit at the core.  Lloyd leaves Providence for love; Harry comes along for friendship and loyalty.

Carrey is as funny as ever, this time playing a stupid rather than a sort of psycho wiseguy. His goofy appearance, including the masterpiece chipped tooth is enough of a cue for pants-wetting, floor-stamping laughter. If you can't decide whether or not to watch this film, trust me- just watch the first 30 seconds. You'll be hooked straight away. No probs. Jeff Daniels' performance is also faultless as Carrey's sidekick. The humour is sometimes crude and vulgar, however. There are a couple of token toilet humour scenes which definitely cross the line.The first half of the film is much better than the second, with the scenes in the guys' apartment really hitting the mark.

And amongst all the silliness, his infatuation with the gorgeous Lauren Holly remains believable and touching.However there is one other person in this movie, who one keeps forgetting - Jeff Daniels. Mr Daniels had a hard job keeping up with his co-star, and it didn't really do him any favours. For a lot of the film, I wished he would take on the 'straight man' role which would have made Carrey's performance even funnier. Do the Farrelly brothers not watch Saturday night television??Overall though, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film, and definitely one of Carrey's finest moments.

Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers.Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors.

It's a great, funny, very entertaining movie. That said, I'd still hold that it's not anywhere near being the best comedy ever, as claimed by some fanboys here on IMDb, or even the best Farrelly Bros. movie. That would be asking too much, it being, after all, their first feature movie, and as a consequence still a bit rough around the edges. Namely the plot is a bit on the thin side in that it consists of little more than our two likable losers traveling halfway across the US of A (a nomial distance of 2,200 miles, which they manage to ratchet up to at least 3,000) to return a suitcase to a girl, because one of them has that old-fashioned feeling, where I'd do anything to bone her, and then rampage through the city of Aspen.This is because the culmination of the plot, an elaborate kidnapping story, was more or less dumped unceremoniously from the final cut. A very wise choice, as the movie is now essentially a showcase for the perfect comedic duo, the gentle and laid-back Jeff Daniels and the obnoxious-aggressive Jim Carey, in their hilarious quest to cast aspersions on the definition of humans as a sentient species.Jim Carey went on to rise to greater comedic stardom, but Jeff Daniels is just as brilliant here, and a lot more likable.Just as a side note, I always marveled at Carey's brilliant chipped tooth prosthetic, until I read here on IMDb that those are his real pearly whites -- he does actually have a chipped tooth and just took the cap off.

This is one of those films.The story follows Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) as they trek cross-country, ostensibly to return a briefcase to Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) but equally motivated by Lloyd's desire to strike up a relationship with her. There is some inventiveness in the situations that the duo get themselves into but the story isn't exactly 'edge of your seat' material.The movie lives up to its name with the humour stemming from utter stupidity in most cases. Carrey & Daniels are adept at imbuing their characters with a sincerity that makes the idiotic comments they make endearing in a way.This is perhaps Jim Carrey's finest hour with his comic timing and rubber-faced mugging frequently drawing laughs. Jeff Daniels is a pretty good complement to Carrey's shenanigans though he isn't in the same league as him. The supporting cast is merely alright, with a memorable turn by Mike Starr, who's usually relegated to smaller roles.There's nothing worth remarking about in terms of direction but I will comment on the music. It's a mish-mash of then-hip alternative songs, featured prominently enough at times to seem like an advertisement for the soundtrack album. Remember Dead Eye Dick's hit New Age Girl? Worse than the songs, though, are the (thankfully) brief snippets of a sort of love theme. On the other hand, there's an excellent use of The Cowsill's The Rain, the Park & Other Things.This film isn't exactly awards material but it's a pretty pleasant diversion.

In the winter of 2004 that urinal was named the most influential work of modern art by five-hundred of London's top art experts beating out Matisse, Andy Warhol and Picasso for the top spot. Naturally many found the decision, a bit of a shock but some came to realize that Duchamp's urinal, reflects the dynamic nature of art today and the idea that the creative process that goes into a work of art is the most important thing. The work itself can...take any form (World's Best..., 1). In 1917 critics and audiences alike were appalled by Duchamp's urinal, but today our culture embraces this postmodern fusion of high art with low art. The Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber (1994) could be considered the Duchamp urinal of the 1990's. Once again critics had a hard time embracing the Farrelly Bros.' use of low culture. They still saw cinema as an art-form that should represent a sort of sophisticated entertainment. Although many critics abhorred the film, the box office success and widespread pop-cultural acclaim of Dumb and Dumber suggest that postmodern films should be judged by the postmodern audience rather than the critics.In an interview with Mr. Daniels, Leon Harris asks, Is this your kind of humor? Is this the kind of thing you'd watch when you want to go out and see something funny? in an attempt to understand how such a qualified actor could sink so low (Daniels, 2). Daniels responds with, I know that I am ready for...an hour and a half of nothing but laughs, and if movies like Dumb and Dumber can do that, then I think that has value. (Daniels, 2).Daniels defends his decision to star in the film and also questions the role of comedy in the artistic world. He recognizes that the Academy Awards tend to favor serious dramatic films that evoke deep thoughts rather than lowbrow comedies that simply cause laughter. He essentially exposes this bias that exists within the critical world that favors sophistication over anti-intellectualism. Does the fact that Dumb and Dumber won the MTV Movie Award in 1995 but was never considered for an Oscar nomination mean that it was a complete failure? Who is to say one human being's opinion is more valid than another's? While some might have seen Harry the dog groomer as a step down for Daniels, his involvement with both low and high forms of entertainment demonstrate this flexibility that the postmodern era embraces.Dumb and Dumber was released on December 16, 1994 and within a few days had become the second biggest December box office opening in Hollywood history (DeRosa, 1). Apparently though, there is quite a market for incredibly dumb comedies about two friends on a road trip to Aspen. The general audience had spoken and $127 million speaks louder than a handful of negative reviews.Headlines for online user comments read, Best Comedy Ever, Painfully Funny, Pure Laughter, Oh Admit it You Love This Movie, If You Don't Like This Movie You're an Insufferable Bore, etc. (User Ratings, 1). Though there are some negative comments strewn about, it is nothing like the critical reviews in magazines and newspapers. Out of over thirty-five thousand user comments, there are only seven-thousand people that graded Dumb and Dumber as average or below (a score of 5 and below on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the best). This means that eighty percent of the people that voted scored Dumb and Dumber above average. Also, about one-third of the voters scored the film with either a nine or a ten. This data illustrates a vast difference between general audience member opinions and critical reviews. After the release of Dumb and Dumber, Bobby Farrelly said, We fully expect to get ripped apart by the critics, but we didn't make it for the critics (Dermody, 1). Again the question arises of whether or not a handful of critics know what is best for postmodern audiences.The human being is a complex organism that can enjoy an opera one moment and laugh at a fart joke the next. Recently the latter tendency has been capitalized upon, but the critic chooses to focus on the finer things in art and culture. Postmodernism attempts to blend these two spheres of the human mind into one while modernism denies its other half. If we follow the modernist assumption that science and technology will lead to a fuller understanding of life than we find ourselves in a bit of a bind. If we study Darwinism and the process of Evolution to find that we, the human species, the children of the Enlightenment are in reality children of apes, the idea that we should only respond to high culture and sophistication is absurd. Millions of years later we still have some of these animal instincts that tell us to laugh at Jim Carrey when he makes a funny face or attempts to wash his mouth out with ketchup and mustard. Some try to cover up these instincts and pretend that sophistication and intellectualism come naturally to humans. If this were the case babies would be born with calculators and paperback copies of Madame Bovary. This is not to say that we should all revert to living in caves and hunting with spears, but we should also remember that we are one chromosome away from being chimpanzees. If Dumb and Dumber does have a message, it is to never become so serious that you cannot laugh at yourself.

The infamous diarrhea scene could have simply been nothing more than a gross potty humor joke for eight year olds, but Daniels turns it into a slapstick masterpiece that would make Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards proud. Unfortunately, the success of this movie (and Daniels' newfound popularity because of it) led him to star in such lame-brained romps as TRIAL AND ERROR, 101 DALMATIONS and MY FAVORITE MARTIAN.

And kind of a guilty pleasure but I do like Gigli for a few reasons, too (Never understood all the bashing & hate).But THIS??? Judging by the poster, it seemed like a flick that was gonna be horrendously dumb, awful, and stupid. I WASN'T WRONG!Did those who've written glowing reviews of Dumb & Dumber see the same movie I did?? Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels have done some great movies, but this is not one of them! Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. But it's an astounding PUTRID dumb film, and a complete waste of celluloid, IMO.Though to be fair, the scene where Harry slams the bathroom door in the face of the guy who's gonna... *ahem*... RAPE Lloyd, in order to put out the fire on his foot, was kinda funny. Even with some of the worst movies you could giggle a bit.Understand. Nostalgic doesn't mean better - it just means you're more attached to it. It boggles my mind that Carrey is one of the highest paid actors out there. This movie, and the one he appeared in before it (Ace Ventura), are unbelievably awful & overrated. These films utilize slapstick/absurdest humor, as opposed to Carrey's running gag of distorted faces and talking out of his butt. Plus, him having a chipped tooth is NOT FUNNY! Oftentimes I felt like saying, What the &%$#@? are you doing??? The characters of Lloyd and Harry are an INSULT to your intelligence! Even if you liked their brand of humor, wouldn't it get old after 30 minutes or so??? My advice I recommend you go watch Jim Carrey's The Grinch or Jeff Daniel's 101 Dalmatians - they play much more convincing & less annoying characters than in this.But this overrated film was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. The story as a whole was difficult to follow, due to the two acting like a distracting fools most of the film. This movie is about a briefcase that never gets mentioned again, bad language, abuse for women, violent homosexuality, gross-out humor, annoying humor, bad pop-culture references, jealousy, unfunny/nonsensical humor, inappropriate humor, and generally other things that I particularly don't want to watch. It's basically a film that tries WAY TOO HARD! And the ending was just awful, left a bad taste in my mouth, being the last nail in the coffin of this bad movie. Long story short, The Mask was the only good Jim Carrey film that came out in 1994.I'm all-round so glad I didn't grow up with this flick; because if I had, I would've likely lost HALF OF MY BRAIN if I did! I would just like it to have my memory erased for acknowledging it exists!Overall, this one is a real dud in my opinion, I give it 3/10PS Happy 20th anniversary... NOT!

Boy was I wrong. I've seen it now 3 or 4 times, most recently last night, and for me it never gets old.  In the vein of good farces like Happy Gilmore or Something About Mary, this one manages to strike a good balance, carefully walking the line between belly laughs and actual gross-out.Like the scene where Lloyd (Jim Carrey) puts laxative in the coffee of Harry (Jeff Daniels)and, arriving at Mary's (Lauren Holly) house we start to hear abdominal gurgles.  Frantic, Harry finds the bathroom, pulls down his pants, sits -- when we hear Mary say, Don't use the toilet, it doesn't flush.  Then we see Harry, pants down to his ankles, taking apart the back of the toilet to try and make it work.Or the scene where they are skiing and Harry, like a kid, touches his tongue to the frosty metal support. And later, as his tongue stretches, as mary pulls his head away. Or the last scene, where Lloyd and Harry direct the bus of bikini girls to the next town, instead of volunteering for the job of rubbing oil all over their bodies.And, of course, the whole idea of trading their hound mobile for a small scooter because it 'makes 70 miles per gallon', then riding to Aspen, in the snow, over passes, and arriving with ice growing from their noses, as Lloyd gets off in Aspen, Harry is stuck to his back. Trying to throw Mary's briefcase into a lake, it opens, they see all the money, then spend it all on a $285,000 car, a hotel suite, fancy clothes, all the while leaving IOUs in the suitcase so they could pay her back eventually.Lauren Holly is a fine actress, but also one of the most strikingly beautiful.  Here she was about 30 during filming, and at the absolute height of her beauty.  No wonder Carrey married her, unfortunately it didn't last.  Jeff Daniels is, to me, an even better comic than Jim Carrey, who is mostly over the top in his acting. Daniels is a more subtle, and funnier, comic. No message in this film, just good fun and laughs. The actual story doesn't matter. My wife cannot stand Dumb and Dumber. I guess it helps to be a bit wacky too.

I commented on Ace Ventura When Nature Calls which is a lot better than this movie. I only compare these two movies because it is a heated argument in my school between a few of my friends. All the comedy in Dumb and Dumber is said as if it is stand-up material. So it's very simple to like a movie like this because they are basically telling you what is funny. I think you should have to think more to find the comedy in a movie. If they just tell you what is funny then to me it doesn't seem to be as funny. A line such as why are you going to the airport?...flying somewhere? is an example of what i mean by telling you the funny parts. With much of the movie like this i consider it obvious comedy, meaning they put 500 of these together and call it a movie. It could also be classified as stupid comedy because both Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels play retard roles basically, anyone can laugh at a retard, and they drive some sort of a dog. And then people say that Ace Ventura When Nature Calls Jim also plays a retard. But i highly disagree with this, there are no parts in Ace Venture Where Nature calls where he gets his tongue stuck on a pole or anything as dumb as Dumb and Dumber. He may make hilarious faces such as when the hot girl starts walking towards him at the campfire in the tribe dance. But my main point is Dumb and Dumber is dumb after 5 minutes, and gets dumber throughout the entire movie.

Jim Carrey plays limo driver Lloyd Christmas who picks up Mary Swanson and is instantly infatuated. She leaves her briefcase in an airport terminal where he nabs it before two villains do. He and his friend Harry Dunne take it to Aspen where she claimed to be going. Not a bad start for directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly who detail this road comedy with many hilarious moments including Jim Carrey going martial arts against an enraged cook, or Lauren Holly receiving a snowball to the face that was much bigger than her head, or Jeff Daniels making an urgent call to the washroom after drinking coffee spiked with laxative. Great comic performances by Carrey as the love struck Lloyd, and Jeff Daniels as the dog loving Dunne. Lauren Holly is a wonderful romantic foil whom isn't the typical damsel. Unfortunately the villains are typical and cardboard but Charles Rocket does his best as the menacing leader. Some humour is adult nature including one involving a parakeet, or a urine joke involving a roadside cop. Another bad moment involves someone being shot at the unintentional sudden urge of another person. Otherwise this mindless comedy stresses friendship and other questionable antics.

After all, what kind of person doesn't laugh at a man firing hot waves of watery excrement out of his horrorstruck anus, or at a blind boy stroking a decapitated bird, or at an owl being shot by a cork? These are all things that should appeal to any right-minded individual &#150; it's comedy at its basest, but the funny bone should never be concerned with good taste.Of all the gags and silly lines in Dumber and Dumber, my favourite moment actually involves attempted male rape (always a prime source for comedy!). The moment I'm talking about is when Sea Bass very nearly forces himself on one of our heroes. But one of the things I love most about the scene is Lloyd's fascination when reading the message on the toilet wall. 'For manly love be here March 25th at 215am sharp' it reads. Lloyd looks amused, even a little bit curious, but then as he consults his watch you hear a 'Wah-wah' on the soundtrack, which translates into 'you're about to get buggered' and the smile on his face vanishes. Wonderful stuff.But the character of Sea Bass himself is just bloody hilarious (even if he only has two scenes and hardly says anything). I could easily watch an entire film devoted to him and his sour-faced, bad tempered homosexual antics. But as it stands we only get him spitting into a burger and him trying to molest someone. But that's enough, I guess. However, there is another great Sea Bass moment. Just watch Sea Bass when Lloyd and Harry are trying to scam him. The way he points to himself and his 'boys' never fails to crack me up.Another supporting character rich in comedy is Mental the gangster. He has quite a few amusing moments, but the best one by quite some margin is when his phone conversation in a phone booth is interrupted by some bespectacled nitwit. The man is so geeky and so annoying that the punch that comes thundering through the glass not only induces laughs but also elicits cheers &#150; you can't help but like this bloke. However, as likable as this mentalist is, die he must. And his death scene includes some of Carey's and Daniels' best acting. Just look at them when they spike Mental's burger. They're like kids &#150; they can't suppress their mirth.Speaking of acting, it's not a surprise that Carey is so good at acting dumb, but it's something of a minor revelation that Daniels is so good at comedy. After all, before this, he was known for more serious roles. But here Daniels' allows his IQ to plummet and he more than holds his own with his more experienced counterpart.One of the most enjoyable things about Dumb and Dumber is how petty and bad tempered the two friends are ('You are one pathetic loser&#133;no offence') &#150; some of the best scenes are the ones where they argue like school kids. A great scene happens near the end &#150; Lloyd and Harry are arguing over Mary. They no longer want to be friends and Harry asks him where he has to sign. 'Right on my ass after you kiss it!' And I can't help but crack up at Lloyd's shooting fantasy when he sees Mary's husband. Both characters are borderline psychotic, which only makes the film even funnier.I also like how relentlessly horny Lloyd is. Just take the scene when he first meets Mary. The quasi-romantic music and the way Lloyd grabs his heart when Mary walks back into her house are bloody hilarious, as is the 'Goodbye, my love!' moment at the airport (also note Lloyd's reaction when he hugs his 'love' &#150; the groan as he relaxes his body is disturbingly sexual). And I've also just remembered the 'Be strong' moment and the little sobbing sound he makes (man this film is funny!). But just as good as this is Lloyd's daydream as he drives. The way he sneaks a look at Mary's butt is priceless (and what a butt it is, too!). And then the schmoozing at his dinner party (if only lighted farts really did impress people at 'sophisticated' parties) and the fight at the restaurant. But although the fisticuffs are brilliant, there's a much smaller and funnier moment in this scene &#150; note the way the waiter chucks Lloyd's plate onto the table and the way he carefully places Mary's; who says the film isn't subtle? But even though there are one or two gags which can rightly be declared as subtle, they kind of pale in comparison to the instances of bad taste. Just take the officer drinking his own urine ('give me the booze you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!') or Harry crapping his brains out. These are the showcase moments. But as good as these are, what keeps me coming back are the little things &#150; Lloyd trying to buy a copy of 'Rhode Island Slut', Lloyd gagging when he sees his best friend hanging out with his 'girl', the 'big gulps' moment, the look on Harry's face when he finds out that his best friend has been wearing extra gloves and Lloyd burping in utter contempt when he gets stuck next to an insufferable woman at a bar. As dumb as the characters are, there's far too much great comedy for it to be written off as a dumb film &#150; you've got to be smart to make stupidity as funny as it is here.

Its a small detail you wont notice the first time, but I've watched it a couple of times and I wonder how the Farrelly brothers could Miss this...But when the movie ends you must have had a good laugh, or something is seriously wrong. If Jim Carrey wasn't starring in this movie it wouldn't be as good as I think it is. But Jim Carrey is a Comedic genius. All in all, maybe the funniest movie i have ever seen.

When I saw this initially I wasn't impressed at all and it was when I was forced to sit and watch for a second time whilst on holidays and it amused me slightly. By the sixth time it was downright hilarious. There was this camaraderie between Carrey and Daniels and they really look like they had a great time making this movie. This is a rare comedy where it's funny all the way through and doesn't die in the middle or get stale at the end because of Carreys and Daniels great chemistry. These two although are never likely to earn anything from this movie except for a huge amount of money and laughs but thats okay because not all movies are award material. I am thankful for the fact that there has never been a dumb and dumber sequel because I don't think that it could have lived up to the original (which the prequel proved. The funniest parts for me are the travelling in the infamos wagon to Aspen from the meeting with the highway patrolman to the tough guys in the café (watching this scene should prove to anyone that these two are not as foolish as they appear to be) along with the chilli pepper scene.I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great slapstick comedy.

What is worse, the movie is totally devoid of sophisticated special effects and it is a very rapid example of cinema making (the movie has no intermissions when a viewer can think of his own problems). Where is a slow-paced movie with two-three jokes being prolonged and mixed with clever dialogues and fierce gun plays? Where are remarks dedicated to the meaning of life? Where is the perfect English speech? It is only a start of fault-finding.This movie must be re-cut in order to delete all the terrifying scenes (heart tearing, worms breeding, beating of a woman in snowy surroundings, tongue torture, bottle pissing, toilet destruction, spitting into food, rejecting beautiful girls in the end, etc.). Dumb and Dumber is completely inappropriate for our modern high-tech community. Its full version must be banned in all countries and all DVDs with it must be demolished. Hate this movie because...In other words, it is a classic comedy stuffed with some unique gags, grimaces, and dialogues.

I saw this movie when it first came out and I was instantly hooked on it. I laughed very hard when I watched it on the big screen (by the way, I was twelve years old when this film was theatrically released). Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are terrific as the two lead characters. The rest of the cast also really glows. This film will probably still be a favorite with me even when I am past the age of fifty.The film is about two best friends who are unable to keep sensible, steady jobs while hoping to eventually start their own business. Lloyd was working as a limousine driver when he met a gorgeous woman named Mary Swanson. He proceeded to drive her to the airport when he fell madly in love with her. She leaves her briefcase in the airport terminal and Lloyd immediately rushed to get it back to her. He was too late and lost his job following his fall from the jet-way. Harry was also terminated after he failed to deliver dogs to the proper pet show on time. After much deliberation, Harry and Lloyd decide to take a road trip across America. Their destination Aspen, Colorado. Lloyd wants to be reunited with Mary so that he can start a relationship with her, in addition to returning her the briefcase she left behind. Little do the boys know that they are being pursued by a couple of criminals who are after the money that is being kept inside the locked briefcase; they were sent on the mission by Nicholas Andre, a man who is linked somehow to Mary and her family.I have several favorite sequences from this hysterical picture. One is where Harry and Lloyd encounter trouble at a truck-stop diner. A truck driver named Sea Bass is accidentally hit with a salt-shaker from Harry. Sea Bass is irritated and spits on Harry's hamburger. Lloyd decides to seek revenge on Sea Bass and his gang by telling the staff that they are willing to pay for the service that he and Harry received at the restaurant. By the way, the waitress that they talk to is a very cute young woman with black hair. She also seems to be very sweet. They get away with this scheme while the overly tough Sea Bass is left feeling tremendous amounts of anger. I also like it when the duo puts atomic hot peppers on Joe's burger and makes him sick; he has an ulcer and cannot have such edibles. Joe groans and gives a request for his medicine; Harry unknowingly gives Joe rat poison, which instantly kills him. I also liked it when Harry drank the tea containing the Turbo Lax; this made him have to go very bad as his bowels were getting ready to pop.I love this movie! Dumb & Dumber will forever remain to be one of my favorite films. There are so many moments in this movie that are exceedingly hilarious. I recommend this title for anyone who loves to laugh.

And it's nothing short of well, dumb. But if a movie is to be judged on how well it achieves it's desired goals, then this comedy is a roaring success. Because being dumb is the whole point. But besides featuring top-notch stupid humor, the film has what other dumb comedies such as Freddy Got Fingered and Half Baked lack. Charm and even some touching aspects. Dimensions that bring the purpose of the story full circle. Pedomorphic protagonists Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) make their journey to Aspen with the noble intent to return what they think is a lost briefcase to wealthy socialite Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) and pursue Lloyd's on-the-spot infatuation with her. In their stupidity however, never truly seem to understand the real circumstances surrounding the attaché and the trouble it could cause.Even if this movie is what you believe to be not your thing, as is the mentality many have toward stupid comedies, at least give it a try. Sit back, put a laxative in your tea, and just go with it. And don't get up to go to the bathroom once.

There's Something About Mary may have been a bigger critical hit, but this film, uniting the talents of Carrey and Daniels is the funniest film of the decade, and for fans of this kind of humour, it is the best comedy ever. If you like your jokes subtle, or Frasier style then be warned-here we have lewd sexual jokes, making fun of blind kids, drinking urine, and laxatives...Dumb and Dumber is above all a road movie, following two friends who are dumber than the average person across America in search of a woman who left her briefcase behind. Lloyd (Carrey) works as a chauffeur, and after taking a beautiful woman to the airport he realises she has forgotten her briefcase. He takes it, intending to give it back to her, getting fired in the process. Unknown to him, she left it on purpose as it was full of money for the mob. Soon two hit men are after Lloyd. His friend Harry looks after dogs, and after he messes up another job he too is fired. After hitting rock bottom they decide to look for the briefcase girl, as Lloyd has fallen for her and hopes that she will love him when he returns her case. All he knows though is she is called Mary, and was going to Aspen. So they head out on the road. Along the way the get into a few scrapes, encounter the hit men, get lost, but eventually make it. When they find Mary, Harry goes on a date with her leaving Lloyd jealous. But they are both kidnapped leaving Lloyd to save the day.This is Carrey's funniest performance, every second he is on screen will make you laugh. Daniels is the perfect support, being equally dumb but letting Carrey steal the show. Holly is very good as Mary also, and the rest of the cast are good in mostly small parts, from the hit men to Sea-bass. The cinematography is very good for a comedy, exploiting the scenery to its fullest, the soundtrack is brilliant, and the plot is hardly complex, but nor is it simple. Funny moment are everywhere, and everyone has their favourites. Mine- the fact that when Harry asks Lloyd to buy only the bare essentials as they have no money left, then Lloyd goes and buys a jumbo hat etc, the dream sequence featuring lighting farts and a vicious fight, the Sea-Bass sequence, and the snowball Harry throws at Mary, yes laughing as i type (must watch it later). Other moments include, 'Pretty bird', 'Tick-tack sir?', the laxatives, and various one-liners. Aside from all the jokes, the film has a charm about it, the two friends are constant losers but we love them anyway. 1994 was a magnificent year for movies, many of my favourites come from then, and this is undoubtedly one of the best.10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Dumb&Dumber music","Date":"31 January 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" PLease help me!!

Another great aspect of this film is Jim's co-partner in comedy, Jeff Daniels. He gives good company to Jim and adds more humour to already saturated comic situation's !!!  The main plot revolves all around two lovable idiots and best friends Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) who can easily win the joint-crown for being two of the most foolish guys in probably the whole Universe !!! One fine day Lloyd meets a lady, Mary (Lauren Holly) in due course of his life and his heart-bells ring at once.

So from here takes off Lloyd's and Harry's adventure to return the lady her belonging and their experiences during this journey acts as the much needed fodder for the film. Jim Carrey is cool as usual. Can't have been better. He is so versatile, so fluid, so PERFECT...Does he realise that he is the best guy around who can use his face so well ?? It's amazing to watch him mould his face into thousand expressions in fraction of a moment !!! Jeff Daniels gels with Jim so well and both of them play the role of being the most imperfect guys in the most perfect manner...Jeff really is praise-worthy in his attempts of matching the skills of Jim, the comedian and gives him serious competition throughout. He makes you think sometimes that who is more funnier?? Also Lauren Holly's contribution of adding a glamorous look can't be ignored.

She thinks it is dumb, and I certainly agree, but it's also quite good fun. It's a dumb movie, with dumb laughs, mostly played dumb, but it's pretty good dumb fun as far as dumb fun goes nowadays. I rate it a strong 10 of 10 for excitement, humor, and buttocks.It's about two goofballs (Carrey and Danielsen) who find a briefcase full of money and decide to give it away to a pretty young lady. They offer it to her for sex, and she lays them both, but afterwards they begin to stalk her, embarking on a cross-country trip to Aspin in hopes of marrying her and having children - both of them!!It's sort of sick but what else would you expect from the Farrley Bros., the guys who brought us LOST HIGHWAY and the hilarious MULHOLLAND DRIVE? I give it a strong 10 for these elements and advise that some people stay away - it's rated R for some scenes of strong sexuality, and believe me, there are some strong scenes!

That's not to say only the simple-minded will find this entertaining. It's just a picture about two ridiculously dumb guys that gets its comedy from their stupidity. Some people may consider that sophmoric but in this case for the most part it is very well written, and is executed beautifully by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the ONLY 2 who could have done it that way (not a smart move making a sequel/prequel with 2 completely different and unknown actors). The jokes are consistant throughout the entire movie and the events all fall into place nicely, and the plot for the movie was original. It's a comedy, and as long as it's funny, it's done it's job and this movie doesn't have to go to ridiculous lengths or screw up the plot as an excuse to get laughs, it just does it easily and smoothly.In my opinion this is one of Jim Carrey's best comedys and Jeff Daniels does a great job as well. I understand some people prefer more sophisticated or intelligent comedys or just more advanced ones and I respect that, but if you're just looking for a good funny movie that you can just chill and laugh to, you can't go wrong with this true comedy.

With near perfect direction and fantastic acting, this movie became one of the greatest comedy movies ever made.Fresh off Ace Ventura, Jim Carrey delivers another brilliant performance as Lloyd Christmas. The laughs never stop when he is on screen with his natural physical comedy and hilarious facial expressions.  A usually serious actor in Jeff Daniels is surprisingly plays one of the funniest characters in all of movie history.  He in my opinion was the funnier one (and dumber one), even though both actors delivered the laughs.Setup as a dumb comedy to make you laugh at dumb things, it turns out to be a genius comedic film.  Just about every scene in the movie was made to make you laugh, but coming up with these dumb things is not easy at all.  The Farrely Brothers delivered their finest movie in Dumb and Dumber, with Theres something about Mary coming second.I can honestly say that every scene in this movie has something to laugh at, whether its toilet humor, physical humor, stupid humor, spoof of something, and of course shock humor.  The Farrely Brothers gave a world a movie that you can laugh at from beginning to end, and not have one serious scene in it.  Usually these movies bomb, but this one happens to be one of the very best.  Watch it over and over and over again and you will no doubt still be laughing!  Are you sad, depressed, lonely?

You know, I wonder whether a sense of humor can be correlated to individual courage.  There are people who don't find this movie, or lots of funny stuff, funny. I wonder if they are living and acting and having a personal style that they don't really like, just to conform or please someone else.  I wonder if that sort of self-prison keeps them from finding much of anything spontaneously funny. There was a pony-tailed pseudo-intellectual type sitting behind us in the theater.  I heard him in the parking lot afterward, telling his friends that he just didn't see what was so funny or how anybody could laugh at Dumb and Dumber.  Well, I laughed because the stuff was funny, and I wasn't busy trying to act or dress or sit some way that I thought someone wanted me to act or dress or sit.  Doing things my way allows me to laugh at a lot of things (and not laugh at a lot of things).  Maybe I won't have a heart attack, either, or miss great moments in life everyday.

At no time does it drag, as is often the case with most comedies thesedays. Films like Theres Something About Mary tend to have their funny, laugh-out-loud moments but they are few and far between.Carrey and Daniels play off each other very well. I think this film works extremely well for Carrey (a generally comedic actor) because its not all about him and he is not always relied upon to make the audience laugh, unlike in Ace Ventura where he is forced to be the constant source of humour which thus makes it harder to sustain such a high level of humour. Daniels has his fair share of one-liners and so this periodically helps to take the focus away from Carrey which is probably a good thing because his unique style of humour is not always to everyones taste!All in all, this is a very funny film which is extremely quotable and that is always the sign of a good film (one that sticks in your head).

Now imagine those two in charge of returning your lost luggage. Wow, what a feat it would be if you ever received your luggage back. This film shows that even two idiots can deliver a briefcase across America when they put half their brains together. One of the underlying themes is that this is a love story, plain and simple. It's what really drives Carrey, and Daniels across country to deliver the goods.Most of today's pure comedies tend to have a cast that isn't half as strong as Dumb and Dumber. Thankfully Time Warner made this movie in the early stages of several of the cast members careers. Names like Jim Carry who plays Lloyd Christmas, Jeff Daniels as Harry Dunne, these guys are lead actors equally sharing half the movie, and it's directed by the Farrelly Bros. to boot! It's hard to have a bad movie with those names on the scene, and this is no exception!They say never do business with family, but that couldn't be less true for the Farrelly Bros. Very few first or second time directors have been able to produce terrific films in the same vein as Dumb and Dumber, so early in their careers. A few directors that have had similar movie success are Robert Rodriguez, Manoj Night Shyamalan, and Orson Wells. I can only interpret that we're on the cusp of a lot of laughs and more great movies by the Farrelly's.Several slap stick movies tend to drag but this one continues to keep the audience moving. This is an Airplane, Naked Gun type film that has the viewers just itching to find out what these two numbskulls will say next. It's 101 continuous minutes of unbridled childish laughter.In order to deepen the secondary love theme, the Farrelly's used two techniques music and symbolism. In one scene Carrey goes into a daydream-like state thinking about what life would be like with Lauren Holly, she plays Mary Swanson the beautiful `out of reach' woman who lost her baggage. Carrey tilts his head back, the camera moves in closer, and The Love Affair by Dick Walter starts playing. The audience knows that they are in the dream state because for the entire song they show continuity clips of Holly and Carrey having a wonderful life together. Great use of editing to music, even the proverbial beach running scene even makes a cameo.  One attempt at symbolism is in the same dream sequence, Carrey hugs Holly and about ten doves fly out of nowhere from behind them. The doves symbolize the innocents and immaculate cleanliness that is most typical of a dreamy love sequence.Face time, ego and money rule the silver screen when it comes to big Hollywood names. Every once in a while you can find two lead characters split everything in the film, including jokes, mishaps, and adventures. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels share the screen and script perfectly. This is a movie that left the audience wondering, who's funnier, and who's dumber? "},{"Title":"I should sue......

He drove her to the airport, then realized she forgot her briefcase. Lloyd wants to return it to her and, when Harry is convinced, they jump in their van and head west, to Aspen, Colorado.        Harry's van looked like a huge dog, because he used to be in the dog grooming business. They stop at a roadside diner and make friends with a trucker named Sea Bass. (Memorable line TRUCKER Kick his ass, Sea Bass!)       They encounter more disaster down the road, like when Lloyd accidentally drives them in the wrong direction! So he does the only sensible thing to do trade in the van for a mini-bike that get's 70 miles to the gallon. On to Aspen!       They make it and again are down on their luck, until they realize Mary's briefcase was full of $$$! They go on a wild spending spree and run into Mary at a fancy party. Harry goes skiing with her the next day while Lloyd waits for her at the bar. Harry had told him that she would meet her there. Lloyd was heart broken she didn't come, so he played a joke on Harry for making up the story laxatives in his cocoa. Pretty soon, Harry, Lloyd and Mary are held hostage by Nicholas Andre, the rightful owner of the briefcase.Before long, he's arrested and it turns out Mary was married. So Lloyd and Harry leave Aspen and try and find luck someplace else. They may just catch a break.         Pretty funny movie! I heard constant rumors that there would be a sequel.

But, like almost any Farrelly Brothers movie, the tastelessness factor gets elevated to a work of art.  Of course, it's hard to visualize anything involving Jeff Daniels accidentally taking a gulp of Turbo-Lax and having the worst case of diarrhea (which I believe is the pinnacle of the film, and will ALWAYS make me laugh again and again and again) art, but if you look at the word in a figurative sense and observe how the Farrelys handle each situation with perfect timing and delivery--you'll get what I'm saying.  The Farrelys are underrated geniuses in the comedy genre, who sometimes tend to overdose on the crudeness, but their style of humor is often effective.  Peter and Bobby (Farrely) are aware that these characters are dumb and don't use it as an excuse to have the audiences laughing at them, rather than with them.  Of course, there are moments--like the jalapeno scene where Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are squirting mustard and ketchup into their mouths--that are just plain...dumb.  But this is not a hit-or-miss comedy.  The misses happen only on occasion; the hits happen very often.  The plot is very original.  I'm sure the concept of two simple minds with almost nothing to live for is a concept that's been used before, but it's the way the concept is handled that makes it special.  Most of the time I was either laughing or laughing relentlessly.  Another memorable moment is the Harland Williams, urine-sipping cameo.  That is bound to make you laugh 'til you're senseless!One minor flaw I found was the soundtrack  a compilation of melancholy, easy listening crap that would've been appropriate for a seventies melodrama.  I felt the music brought down the mood a tad.  Other than that, the combination of original writing, slick direction and a stellar cast (including some Farrely favorites) is quite a delight.My score  7 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"Hilirious Road Movie!","Date":"25 April 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"    This is a fantastically funny film! it's the story of Lloyd and Harry (Carrey and Daniels) who are tired of the same old boring, hard life.

Comedy ain't easy to do.  It's tough to sustain a level of hilarity for over an hour and a half, but Dumb and Dumber ranks right up there with the best comedies ever put on film.  It is consistantly hilarious from beginning to end.  A non-stop romp buddy film in which just as you think it couldn't possibly get any more absurd, it does.Asked my favorite comedy of all time, it'd still probably be Planes, Trains and Automobiles, oddly enough, another buddy film.  Dumb and Dumber would be in my top three.  Why?  Well, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are simply superb.  Carrey has built his entire career on portraying rubber-faced idiots.  Daniels, however, has a much more eclectic body of work, but as an idiot, this is absolutely his finest hour.  This film is rude, crude, obnoxious, loud, uproarious, and if you don't find yourself with tears of laughter streaming down your face at some point, then you're probably either unconscious or asleep. Daniels graces us with what is the single best toilet scene ever put to film.  In the grand scheme of things, that may not be saying a lot, but compare it to other similar scenes like the one in American Pie or the farting scene in Blazing Saddles and you'll get what I'm talking about.  If his experience after unknowingly gulping down a bottle of Turbo Lax doesn't have you howling, then there's something seriously wrong with you.A very very VERY funny film.

Pursued by mobsters, police and hindered by their own incompetence, the pair eventually find Aspen and the owner of the brief-case (Holly - with whom both men become enamoured) only to find themselves unwittingly the target of a murderous extortionist.There's some great scenes along the way, including the truck-stop bully at the diner, then again in the service station toilet, the patrol officer who takes an ill-advised swig from a tainted beer bottle and though entirely unrelated to the story, the immortal scene where a bus-load (literally) of bikini models offer the pair the dream job as oil-boys. Daniels is surprisingly humorous considering he's not essentially known as a comedian, while Carrey is, fortunately, more restrained than at times in other movies. Teri Garr, Felton Perry and Hank Brandt have minor supporting roles, adding some depth to the cast.A decent soundtrack developed by Todd Rundgren contains some memorable tunes, not least of all by The Cowsills and Rundgren himself, and the tone of the picture is generally pleasant and easy-going. Nothing too distasteful or gratuitous and so long as you watch it in the right frame of mind, should keep you entertained. There's plenty of conjecture over the tone of the ending - not the crowd-pleaser you might expect - and though frustrating, it's consistent with the narrative and probably just what needed to happen.

After all, when I approach a site that asks my favorite movie...I don't have to think twice......Dumb and Dumber. I guess the truth is, you have to LOVE comedy to truly appreciate this movie. Sure, there are other great comedy movies, but I just feel like no movie really uses every second to other second to make you laugh like Dumb and Dumber does. You have to see the true art of being able to make a pun or underlying joke out of any simple phrase....Big gulps, huh?.If you want to see a clever, well-educated, plot heavy, witty comedy.....go see a Woody Allen movie. If you want to exercise your right to let go, relax, not think too hard about everything, and just LAUGH... this is it. I've been quoting this movie since I was 15, and probably will till I'm at least 50. Anchorman is the closest I've seen to a movie like this that's purely quotable and makes you want to pause the movie just so you can finish laughing before something else makes you feel like you'll throw up from laughter.I say any movie can really be depressing and dramatic and friggin win an Oscar.....but comedy is an under-appreciated art form. One that makes you feel good. Makes you want to be a fun person. Makes you want to soak up life and take it a little less serious. Since when has an award winning movie like Memoirs of a Geisha provoked such joyful feelings in a person. The only thing it gave me was an unhealthy interest in Asian women.This movie is solid gold. There's a reason why nearly every Farrely Brothers movie that comes out uses the tag line From the guys who brought you Dumb and Dumber......cause it set the bar for comedy in a whole new way and those guys are still trying to pull that off again. If you're one of those people that think this movie is stupid...lighten up. Watch it again and WANT to laugh. Enjoy it for what it is and bask in the pure insolent joy that comes with a perfect comedy.Well.....see ya later....

The dialog is hilarious, utterly hilarious, but the real reason this film is such a gem is faces the characters make in-between the dialog. I have to mostly attribute this to Jim Carrey and his brilliance in his early career. I can still laugh at jokes I've heard a hundred times before because I will notice subtle nuances I never noticed before in Jim's face. For a film focusing on the dumb, it is intelligently written. Yeah, there is the usually toilet-humor (hilarious nonetheless) but there are very intelligent jokes happening to mix things up.

I've seen this movie at least thirty times and it makes me laugh out loud every single time. Yes, the characters are stupid (hence the title), but the comedy is genius. The dialog and layers of comedic devices render silly visual and verbal jokes into sublime hilarity. This movie is like a treatise on comedy--employing irony, satire, slapstick, scatological humor, puns, mistaken identity, and double entendre. Sometimes they come in rapid succession and sometimes they are used simultaneously. This is why the movie is so re-watchable...you can pick up on new layers of jokes with every viewing.If you love movies like Old School(2003), The Big Lebowski(1998), There's Something About Mary(1998), This is Spinal Tap(1984), or The Jerk(1979) then you can't help but love Dumb & Dumber!

He really deserves some credit for this role, I don't think anyone is going to argue that Jim Carrey is the main draw for this film.  Jeff has to play someone that is going to be with Jim Carrey for the bulk of the film and will have to get just as many laughs as Jim.  ...And Jeff Daniels pulls it off!  He gets just as many laughs as Jim and was an excellent choice for the role.

I watched it up until Lloyd was daydreaming at the wheel of the car about his dreamgirl, Mary and then shut it off. I liked it up until the state of events about the bumbling crooks, the suitcase full of money, etc. I didn't want the film to be about that. I wanted it to be about two idiots getting into trouble. Not all this serious crap going on.Now that it's been about eight years since I've seen it, I appreciate the film a bit more now. The first forty five minutes of the film are very entertaining and very funny. I laughed a lot in that time frame. Then once the film gets more and more about the crooks, and less about the antics of the two goofball leads I started to care less and less about the outcome.The plot Lloyd (Carrey) and Harry (Daniels) are two slackers who are trying to save enough money to go into business selling worm related novelties and worm-farms. Lloyd is a limo driver, and Harry is a dog-groomer. One day, while taxiing a beautiful women to the airport (Holly), Lloyd noticed she leaves a suitcase on the ground (purposely). The suitcase was left for two henchman to have. Lloyd swoops in and retrieves the case much to the dismay of the henchman who now believe Lloyd works for someone who is planning to disrupt their plan.Lloyd and Harry aren't aware that they are prey to two dangerous henchman, so they now go on a trip from Rhode Island to Aspen to give the beautiful women her suitcase back. Which obviously leads to slapsticky antics by both of the leads.The jokes are hit or miss, but there are scenes like at the diner and when the guys get pulled over that I can help but laugh at. They are right up my alley those kind of scenes. My favorite line in the film is when Harry and Lloyd go to Nebraska instead of Aspen. Both are expecting to see The Rocky Mountains, but seeing Nebraska is flat as a board Jim Carrey states John Denver is full of s**t, man! Had me laughing out loud for minutes. Both Carrey and Daniels give surprisingly great performances. I say surprisingly because I'm rather not too fond of Jim Carrey because in many of his films he seems to be off his own medicine, or just running around like a dumbass for ninety minutes. In this film he does a rather humorous role, and is actually a pleasure to have on screen.I would give this film a better review it had been about the two trying to start their own business. I'm rather not too fond of the film's plot because I don't care about the goofs trying to flee from thugs. The whole joke is that they don't know they're prey, and are pretty much going with the flow on the whole trip. If the film would've played like a better comedy instead of throwing this ho-hum plot at us maybe I would've appreciated it more.Dumb and Dumber is good slapstick material, but it doesn't compete to slapstick gold like Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Black Sheep is one of my favorite films, and has one of my favorite actors in it too, Chris Farley obviously. Dumb and Dumber was said to put The Farrelly Brothers on the map. This was followed by films like Me, Myself & Irene and There's Something About Mary. Who would've thought that a movie about two dopes would've gave two brothers a successful career. That is so dumb, fo' real.Starring Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and Lauren Holly. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly.

Basically in Providence, Rhode Island, Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) works as a limousine driver, and his best friend and roommate Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) works as an operator for a mobile pet grooming service called Mutt Cutts, they are the friendly and lovable, but together probably the stupidest people ever. One day Lloyd drives Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) to the airport, she is travelling back home to Aspen, he instantly falls in love with her, but then he watches her leave a briefcase in the terminal, before kidnappers Joe Mental Mentalino (Mike Starr) and J.P. Shay (Karen Duffy) can collect it Lloyd retrieves it and tries to return it, without success. Lloyd is unaware the briefcase contains ransom money for the return of Mary's husband Bobby (Brad Lockerman), he is fired from his job, as is Harry for delivering dogs late and accidentally dirty to a show, Mental and Shay have followed them, the duo mistake them for debt collectors and escape out the window, when they later return Harry's parakeet has been decapitated, upset by everything Lloyd suggests they should get away to Aspen. Harry knows Lloyd wants to return the briefcase to Mary and at first opposes the idea, but knowing Lloyd wants to find happiness agrees, and they set off the next day in Harry's dog looking van, Mental and Shay find out their plan and follow them. The kidnappers catch up to the pair, Mental poses as a hitchhiker to be picked up, while Shay follows, they stop for lunch, Lloyd and Harry prank Mental with chili peppers in his burger, and trying to help him give his medication for his ulcer they unintentionally poison him with the pills he planned to use on them. The pair continue towards Colardo, but Lloyd takes a wrong turn and ends up driving through Nebraska, Harry realises the error and is angered, eventually giving up on the journey and deciding to walk home, but Lloyd returns after trading the van for a moped and persuades him to go on to Aspen. The two arrive in Aspen but are unable to locate Mary, at night they stand by a fire to keep warm, and in a scuffle over gloves Harry throws and breaks open the briefcase, discovering the money, they borrow it to get a luxury hotel, clothes and a Lamborghini Diablo. In the newspaper they find out Mary and her family are hosting a gala, they prepare to attend, Lloyd is too nervous to talk to Mary, so gets Harry to bring her over, but through the influence of Mary's mother Helen (Teri Garr) reluctantly agrees to go skiing with her the next day, lying to Lloyd he has a date with her. The next day Harry spends the day on the slopes with Mary, but Lloyd finds out he lied to him, knowing Harry is seeing Mary again that night he gets revenge, he spikes Harry's coffee with laxative, Harry unintentionally ends up crapping in a broken toilet, while Lloyd arrives at the house, telling Mary he has her briefcase. Lloyd takes Mary to the hotel and shows her the briefcase, and tries to confess his love for her, but she rejects him, then Swanson family friend Nicholas Andre (Charles Rocket) shows up with a gun, he is the mastermind to Bobby's kidnapping, he is angry to discover most of the money has been spent and replaced with IOUs, he takes Lloyd and Mary hostage, and Harry when he returns. Before Nicholas can kill them, the FBI raid the suite, he and Shay are arrested, and Bobby is returned and reunited with Mary, to Lloyd's jealousy. The next day Lloyd and Harry are walking home, all their items have been confiscated and their moped broke down, when a bus full of beautiful bikini dressed women stop they unknowingly decline the chance to be oil boys for their competitions, Harry ironically tells Lloyd they will get their break one day, and the film ends with them having a game of tag as they continue to walk home. Also starring Victoria Rowell as Athletic Beauty, Joe Baker as Barnard, Hank Brandt as Karl Swanson and Cam Neely as Sea Bass. Carrey with his chipped tooth (real with his cap removed for the film) gets his many moments to use his facial and bodily hilarity, especially in a hilarious dream sequence, Daniels is equally great being comedic and getting his great moments, especially the hilarious toilet scene, together they are a pair of morons. This film at the time got mixed reviews, but you surely cannot help but disengage and enjoy, the kidnap format is only slight and allows you to laugh much more at the great slapstick, sight gags and toilet humour during a chaotic road trip, a fantastic comedy.

Ironically, this movie never loses it's hilarity, and I laugh endlessly whenever I watch it for the hundredth time.The title explains it all. Two insanely dumb buddies (you can't really tell who's dumb and who's dumber), Lloyd (Jim Carrey), and Harry (Jeff Daniels), who's lives are going nowhere for obvious reasons. One day, Lloyd drives the beautiful Mary (Lauren Holly) to the airport while working as a limo driver. Mary drops off a briefcase full of ransom money at the airport, and Lloyd, thinking she forgot it, swipes the case, and he and Harry set off on a cross country journey to return it to her in Aspen, oblivious to the fact that they have kidnappers on their trail, intending to kill them and claim the money. Of course, the two idiots have a knack for getting out of danger and/or defeating bad guys without ever knowing they were in danger, so everyone who crosses them is in for a humiliating surprise.This is the kind of movie that you can NOT leave running while you take a bathroom break. You are bound to miss an abundant amount of classic lines. I don't know a movie that I've spent more time in my life quoting than this. The plot of the movie is nothing more than a setup for an endless stream of hysterical jokes, gags, and rampant silliness. And the talented Farrelly brothers do not waste a second. Every chance they get for a clever gag, they take it.The movie actually runs longer than you'd expect. It could have easily been one of those crappy, 80 minute movies where the characters qualify as retarded, and every other character is just as dumb as they are. Well, let me just say that for a dumb comedy, this movie is surprisingly intelligent. The two main characters are EXTREMELY dumb, no question, but are far more realistic and convincing than any of those other retards such as the characters from Dude, Where's My Car. The movie resists any temptation to stoop to the pure stupidity of that crapfest. Instead of everyone being as dumb as the title characters, the title characters are the dumb ones, and the supporting cast, while quirky, are far more mentally stable, and are constantly affected the the ridiculous antics of Lloyd and Harry. When there isn't some riotous line being spoken, or outrageous slapstick being inflicted, the supporting cast is reacting to it.This movie is a tradition in my family, and is still tied with There's Something About Mary the funniest of the Farrelly brothers work. I know nobody who's seen this who doesn't think the movie is great. I probably have the most sympathy for it, however. I give this movie my fullest recommendation of 10/10.It is rated PG-13 for Sexual Content, Crude Humor, Some Violence, and Language.

The story is a bit patchy and besides the acting of Daniels and Carrey the movie totally suck. I like the movie because it has classic slapstick Farelly comedy but this was one of the first movies where Jim Carrey showed he has a dramatic side. It is few and far between but the scene where Lloyd convinces Harry to go to Aspen actually has quite a bit of drama. When Harry gets shot in the hotel room we also see a dramatic scene from Carrey. Most importantly to remember though is that so many people passed on this movie and when it was released no one really expected too much. This movie along with Ace Ventura made Jim Carrey into the 20 million a movie actor he is today. NOTESLauren Holly's one and only decent film. Yes it is stupid, yes it is easy to follow, but what makes it simple is what makes it good. If you don't enjoy this flick than you must not like to laugh.

I remember the first time I saw it my friends and I made a pledge to see how long we could go without laughing and we made it about a minute and a half till Harry's Sheep Dog van goes flying over the hill. From then on, the laughs never stop. Fast forward 11 years and every time I see the movie on TV while flipping through channels, I know I am about to be stationary for the next hour or two. I am not alone when saying this is a very re-watchable movie (there's always something in the next scene you want to stay tuned in for). Just reading through the favorite lines on here brings back so many funny memories such as You're one pathetic loser, Big Gulps Huh, Kick His Ass Sea Bass, and Samsonite, I was way off. Jim Carrey was obviously the hot comedy actor, but Daniels does a great job hanging with him in terms of comedy. One of my favorite examples of Harry is when he spends the day Mary and they get in the snowball fight. While with a group at a movie a few years back, we saw the first teaser for Dumb and Dumberer where all you hear are Carrey and Daniels voices. I and my friends never had more chills up our spines as we thought they were making a new Dumb and Dumber movie with the same actors and hopefully the Farrelly Boys. If you haven't seen this movie, I beg you to do so. I think this is the type of movie that will appeal to all generations younger and older.

Jokes are abundant and often subtle; watching the film multiple times does not bore the viewer, it often makes it more enjoyable. The laughs start in the opening scene and don't end till the credits are rolling. The cast is lead by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Their interactions with one another and the supporting cast make for a memorable comedy. The film takes across the United States, from Rhode Island to Colorado. The soundtrack in the film is very fitting for the gestalt of the movie as a whole. The film doesn't employ many special effects but a wide range of shots, including crane, close-up, and zoom are used. My rational for giving the film a rating of 9 is that a few parts break from the comedic tone and become to serious. Despite that, the movie is great to watch alone, with friends, or with family of all ages. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good genuine laugh.

It's essentially a vehicle for Jim Carrey to show off his array of face pulling and odd voice skills with Jeff Daniels starring as his retarded mate. The film is all about their journey across the States to deliver a briefcase to some chick that Carrey has the hots for. Naturally she doesn't feel the same! There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially when Carrey can't stop urinating into beer bottles whilst Daniels is driving. The subsequent stoppage by the Old Bill sees the cop make a poor choice when he decides to take a swig from one of Carrey's offerings... That pretty much sums up the film, toilet humour, but its all well done! The undoubted highlight of the film is Daniel's frantic attempts to find a toilet to relieve an urgency brought on by Turbolax! Ensconced on his bird's bog he's let it all out and then some before she utters the immortal line 'I hope you're not using the toilet, it doesn't flush'! Comedy gold! There are numerous other funny scenes, too many to mention really. When the focus switches to the serious characters the pace can be a tad slow, but thankfully these scenes are fairly short. The soundtrack features plenty of easy listening 90s and late 80s rock, all harmless enough. Dumb and Dumber is Carrey's best film by far, its a shame that we haven't seen anything of this calibre from him for so long. Another of those films best seen as a group.

This one is the king of the mountain until another comes along to knock it off and going on 11 years there is still no other. The writing, acting, everything to make a classic comedy was here. Carrey gave us the role of his career, that he will always be remembered for. The real surprise here is Jeff Daniels, he comes from mostly dramas and other genres but not comedy but he pulls this role off to a perfection. This also will be the role everyone remembers him for. So, 2 iconic characters were defined here. There aren't that many movies you can say that about. From the gags to the pranks to the downright stupidity of the characters, this is a classic hands down. There isn't a scene in this movie that isn't well known by the people who have seen it. From the opening scene where Lyoid ask for directions to the ending scene where they turn down a job oiling down models, there is not 1 scene that isn't memorable. Some of my favorite scenes are the snow ball fight, the Dante's atomic pepper scene, the dinner preparations scene, the Jeff Daniels bathroom scene, the Sea Bass scene, the urination in the Beer Bottles, Carrey's dream sequence, the Mockingbird singing scene, The apt. scenes, When they find the money scene, the airport scene, the Pete bird scene (his head fell off), the crying like girls watching TV commercial scene, both of them driving into Aspen on a motor cart. The great part about this movie, is about friendship and all the ups and downs friends go through on a trip like this. Its something you should watch with friends. If you look at it as a whole, its actually a heart warming movie about something sacred like friendship and thats something no one should ever mess with. The Farrelly Brothers best movie.

I say that because the movie is purposefully dumb, but also just dumb dumb. It's the directorial debut of the Farrelly brothers who have gone on to create such comedic masterpieces as Stuck on You and Shallow Hal. Really, when you're going into a Farrelly brother movie you know what to expect. It's going to be stupid, but it might be good for a laugh or two. You can't expect much and you shouldn't plan on having the time of your life watching any of their movies.But I digress. Dumb and Dumber is the film that began their career and it stars Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels and Lloyd and Harry, respectively. They're two idiot best friends who drive across the country to return a briefcase to somebody that Lloyd met while working as a limo driver. They get themselves into a lot of trouble as soon as they pick up that briefcase, however, and end up getting a lot more than they bargained for during their misadventures across America.Dumb and Dumber is a comedy that is well aware of its own stupidity, and that's where it garners all of its laughs from, being completely brain dead. It's littered with poop and fart jokes, with a few intelligent quips thrown in here and there. It's story is all over the place and is incredibly convoluted for such a simple buddy comedy movie.Honestly, the script here doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are very funny together. They throw in a lot of their own humor and make the characters of Lloyd and Harry worthwhile. After reading a little bit I learned that some of the film's funniest moments were improvised by Carrey and Daniels which is ironically hilarious, but it makes the film itself that much worse.But, again, I can't be too harsh on this film. It's just another stupid comedy that has nothing more to offer than, as I said before, a laugh or two. In fact, I actually sort of enjoyed Dumb and Dumber. This brand of comedy isn't my thing but the movie entertained. However, it has the most pathetically thrown together and ridiculously abrupt ending I've ever seen in a comedy, and this really left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I was actually close to saying this was a pretty good film, but after it's awful ending I'm going to have to go with pretty bad instead.

I especially thought the dream/fantasy sequences with Carrey very unbelievably funny; they really let him display his full talents, making extremely funny facial expressions and hilarious noises. This movie holds a few of the greatest moments with Carrey that's on film(in my not particularly humble opinion, at least), but apart from those few truly great scenes, the movie isn't all that funny; as mentioned earlier, especially the scenes with Daniels were usually barely funny at all. I would recommend any fan of Carrey to watch this, at least to watch the few very memorable, incredibly funny scenes in which he shows his potential.

I think they deserve oscars for this film being so funny. This was the movie that made the Farrelly brothers and brought Jim Carrey beyond Jim Carrey. I could watch this movie over and over and over.

Some years ago two of my daughters then 11 and 15, put together without prompting, the entire scene in the restaurant when Lloyd dupes Sea Bass into paying for their meals. Their performance was as good as Carrey's and Daniels. I mention this to show the influence this film has had on kids even that age.With the passage of time and fifty or sixty viewings, even the crude edges have worn away, leaving a dearly loved film and a comedy I can't see anyone ever topping. It wasn't just funny in places but simply right the way through it. When I saw the original karate sequence when Carrey is wining and dining Lauren Holly, I cracked up in the theater like I have never done before or since..and it takes a lot for me to lose it!Jeff Daniels, you realise more-so after multiple viewings, has contributed equally to the film in a role totally alien to him, yet the two of them are simply brilliant together. Add to this one of the best soundtracks backing up any film I can recall and you have a grade A winner.If you don't find this funny, you have no sense of unrestrained humor and I would suggest an immediate cat-scan!

I've watched this movie about 10 times and it was just as funny the tenth time as it was the first time.  The gas station scene,when Harry had the runs and when Lloyd confesses his love for Mary were pure genius!  The ending (I won't spoil it here) was also very hilarious. 10/10!!!!!

As it stands they`re both stupid , they both sport ridiculous hairstyles and they`re both in love with the same women and that`s about all the character naunces we get . It`s very difficult to believe in them as real people due to their stupidity becoming just a little too incredible and it`s not helped by Jim Carrey`s slightly OTT performance , though to be fair he`s not as bad as he usually is . It is good to see that the Farrelly brothers improved this protagonist flaw with their next movie KINGPIN and hit the button with THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY by having the main characters play everything straight in comedy situations All in all DUMB AND DUMBER is a fairly good comedy ( A genre I usually despise ) let down somewhat with silliness . Not a comedy classic but entertaining enough    "},{"Title":"gag!","Date":"27 December 2000","Score":"16 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This movie is horribly made, badly scripted, boring and an insult to anyone's intelligence. The sophomoric humor is one thing; I like a good pratfall as much as the next person, maybe more. Here unfunny gags are repeated over and over and over. Why do the 2 stars trek off from Rhode Island toward the west? To chase some woman. How silly and pathetic. Typical Hollywood druling ugly guy(s) wind up with bombshell dame.

Instead, the other passengers laughing at jokes on the screen kept me up, so I resigned myself to watching it.I won't sugar coat this I hated this movie. You know when people are telling jokes, but some jerk keeps blurting out the punchlines halfway through each joke? It really ruins the point of the joke. That's exactly how I felt watching this movie. Every punchline to EVERY joke is telegraphed so far in advance as to suck the humor out of every one of them. The stars are two very talented comedians, but the lake of spontaneity and creativity of the comedy totally wastes them her.So, if you want feel smarter than not only the title characters, but the writers and director of this film, watch this movie. If you want a genuine laugh, watch something else.

Why does Hollywood keep marketing this crap as comedy? If I ever open my own video store, this and the American Pie series will be banned from the shelves.  I'll probably even put up a sign If you're looking for Dumb and Dumber, get out of my store.  I don't want your business.  I have seen funnier stuff in horror films.

If you are a fan of real comedy, please heed my review and do yourself a favor by going out and renting an Abbot and Costello movie. They aren't that funny, but trust me, you'll get many more laughs.

In fact it's so bad it's almost worth watching.  On second thoughts no it isn't.The Dumb and Dumber here really ought to be the writer/director brothers who are responsible for this pile of unadulterated bat guano.  Who gives the Farrellys money to make movies, and why aren't they heavily sedated in secure accommodation?

However, this film (for anyone with a correct upbringing) is embarrassing to sit through.It is like Adam Sandler films - terrible acting, terrible ideas, and hideously immature and blatant jokes. It is difficult to call this movie a comedy, I call it a horror.Adam Sandler does bother more than Carey does, but hey, I won't ever watch another movie by either again. When someone tells you that this movie is funny, immediately discount anything they may say in the future.
