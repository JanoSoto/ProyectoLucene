There is no big surprise, no overly brilliant acting, no twisted story, no well known producer (you all know who I'm talking about..)..But it's a very well made, nice to see movie. Acting is good. Or better, it's like it should be in any movie. Photography seems sometimes a little bit careless, but it's OK- it does the trick. Directing is well done.To get to this conclusion, I compared that flick to Last Boy Scout, because it's basically almost the same background. And I have to say while LBS is supported by the acting of Bruce Willis, this movie is founded on the acting of each actor. They all do well, the evil guy is convincingly evil (flat character maybe, but hey- it's a popcorn flick, don't forget!), the effects are pleasing, the story is neat, and the director does his best to put all of this on the screen so you can enjoy the picture.What do you want more? A bag of popcorn.

What exactly is this movie about? Well, it has possibilities, the Treasury Department decides to use a relatively innocent decoy as a dupe in drawing out a hacker - adventures and attempts at humor ensues.What format did Antoine Fuqua decide to tell this story? - well, since is frame of reference and sum of cinematic knowledge & of life apparently stretches all the way back to DIE HARD - that's what we get - warmed over DIE HARD. But instead of a smirking Bruce Willis (at least original in the beginning) with sarcastic comments to uncut the tension and make it more real - in this case, substitute hip-hop/street in the guise of Jamie Foxx - Jamie certainly tries hard but maybe Spike Lee was right in his comments about Africian Americans and their minstrel movie roles.And while this innocent dupe is wandering around NYC getting into new troubles, do we get any glimmer of humor or thought in the story in keeping him out of trouble? - this might constitute a spoiler alert if anybody cares but in one instance, they think he needs money so they dress up an undercover agent as a mailman and hand him a check - I hope they didn't shutdown the set to spend all day to think of this one. Or that the Treasury Department has a whole special underground computer facility with a hundred agents working on this case but of course, the few that come in contact with Jamie Foxx undercover are the same ones he sees over and over again.But that isn't what crushes the movie - what crushes it is it makes no sense at all and insults our intelligence at every level. And the final insult, we have an omnipotent hacker who can get into an impenetrable government computer & vault and track the whereabouts of Jamie Foxx's character in NYC but when you see the final shot - we're suppose to believe his not-very bright partner with the heart condition was able to elude the hacker and drive around NYC with a excavator to bury the loot in a place where thousands of people work there everyday? If you accept everything at face value, the director apparently made of list of shots he would like to see in a movie - mostly music video shots like helicopter infra-red shots of Manhatten, a tanker skidding on a wet street, people typing on computers, a taxi hitting a Porsche on a wet street, an alley footchase through (get ready) a wet street or places that make no sense like a racetrack (just to be original.) - then add in a bunch of fog machines and water hoses, you have a movie according to the director - the rest of film-making plot, storytelling, acting, coherence and intelligence - that's all secondary (or worse) to moving the camera around real fast and quick cuts.Empty and stupid.

Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself enjoying. Even laughing quite a bit. This and The Replacement Killers are the movies that had people labeling the director Antoine Fuqua as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how since most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than anything Michael Bay has came up with. At any rate...Story Alvin Sanders(Jamie Foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense Treasury agent Edgar(David Morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named Bristol(Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. While these agents are after Bristol, Bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.Jamie Foxx is funny as well as great as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. Doug Hutchinson is okay as Bristol. He can be over-the-top sometimes in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was as Looney Bin Jim in Punisher War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny as Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away. The director went all out there so he gets points for that. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot.

The information he holds leads to him (unknowingly) being followed by both the Feds and the criminal who masterminded the gold robbery. The problem is, he's in no position to profit from the knowledge he has because he doesn't know what the clue means.Two robberies from different ends of the criminal spectrum are carried out at the same time and Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) who'd been arrested for his part in the theft of a consignment of prawns, finds himself sharing a prison cell with John Jaster (Robert Pastorelli) who'd been involved in the theft of $42 million worth of gold from the Federal Reserve. Jaster, a man with a serious heart condition, fears that he may not live long enough to get out of prison and so gives Alvin a cryptic message to pass on to his wife. The message which refers to The Bronx Zoo and There's no place like home, means nothing to Alvin and so he gives it no further thought.The gold robbery had been meticulously planned by Bristol (Doug Hutchison) but during the heist, when he needlessly killed two security guards in execution-style shootings, Jaster was so appalled that he deserted his partner and drove off in the getaway vehicle and hid the gold. After being incarcerated, Jaster is questioned by tough U.S. Treasury Agent Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) but suffers a heart attack during the interrogation and dies. This leaves the ruthless Clenteen with nothing to go on and so he decides to manipulate Alvin's early release from prison so that he can put him out on the street and make it generally known that Alvin knows where the gold is. In order to do this, Clenteen illegally arranges for a tracking device to be implanted in Alvin's jaw.The tracking device enables the agents at a control centre to monitor Alvin's precise location at all times and also to listen in to his conversations. This, Clenteen believes, will bring Bristol out into the open and eventually lead to the recovery of the stolen gold.Bait is an entertaining mixture of action and comedy that includes some well choreographed car chases and stunts. The two dominant colours used are dark-blue and black and they complement the prevailing atmosphere perfectly. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as the hyperactive and apparently not-very-bright Alvin whose personal life and talent for getting into trouble cause problems for both him and the Feds and David Morse makes a big impression as the totally humourless Clenteen. Doug Hutchison is suitably creepy as the soft-spoken psychopathic computer genius whose ability to hack government networks, makes him an on-going threat to the authorities.There's nothing particularly original in Bait but what makes it so enjoyable is Jamie Foxx, some crazy over-the-top moments (like the stunt at the end of the movie) and the skillful way in which the violence and the humour are balanced so effectively.

Some have called this film a poor impersonation of Enemy of the State, but the cast from this movie is actually superior to that cast.Jamie Foxx plays Alvin Sanders, a typical New York City hustler type who runs afoul of the law without being violent. His main game is to steal large quantities of prawns (expensive shrimp) and sell them on the black market. He winds up busted by a guard dog and sent to prison, and that's where his troubles begin.Alvin's cellmate turns out to be Jasper, who dies of a heart attack during questioning about the heist of $42 million in gold from the US Treasury, in which a Treasury agent is murdered (otherwise, they wouldn't have gone to the trouble to catch him). Before he dies, Jasper confides in Alvin (in code) where the gold is, and the T-men realize that he can be used as bait to flush out the superhacker who thinks that he knows where the gold is.Alvin is clueless as to what's going on, but slowly comes to realize during the film that the killer wants him dead, and the government doesn't care if he dies in order for them to catch the Killer. To that extent, the movie uses the formula that The Firm did so well years earlier. Foxx's comedic talents greatly enhance his performance, and show once again (as John Candy did in Cool Runnings) that the proper use for a comedian in a major motion picture is to use his talent to add depth to a dramatic role.Jamie Foxx has won an Oscar for Ray since this movie came out, and is now on the A-list. David Morse went on to star in Hack on television and has impressive credentials all his own. The supporting cast is solid and you'll recognize most of them from their other work (such as Robert Pastorelli of Murphy Brown playing Jasper, or David Paymer, who also was good in Joe And Max on Showtime).When a bad movie takes itself too seriously, and pretends it's a good movie, it can be insufferable. Fortunately for the viewer, this movie takes itself seriously because it really is a good movie, well-acted, and with a cast that makes the most out of what it was given. Sure, the movie could have been better, but not by as much as one might think if they haven't seen it.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was Kimberly Elise as the stereotypical together single black mother who looks down on the very type of man she rushed into bed with to have her child.

(Dir Antoine Fuqua)Jamie Foxx is on a crest of superstardom but wipes out here in this incredibly derivative and unoriginal action comedy that supersedes his talent and an audience's endurance.Foxx plays petty criminal Alvin Sanders, a fast-talking loser who winds up in deep trouble when he's busted for an ill-conceived prawn heist (that's right, a prawn  heist) - so bad that he keeps explaining the difference from regular shrimp) and thrown into jail with another would-be thief named Jaster (Pastorelli) who was part of a two-man operation to rob the Federal Reserve of $42 million in gold bars when his sociopathic partner, Bristol (Hutchison doing a mean John Malkovich) , who offed the two security guards and wound up without their treasure.  Only Jaster knows, or so it seems, and his heart condition only makes matters worse when he croaks during his interrogation by hard-on Treasury Agent Clenteen (Morse, completely wasted of his talent here) who then assumes Sanders might have some knowledge since he rationalizes they were cell mates for eight hours.When he gets nothing from Sanders, Clenteen sees to it he gets his prison sentence and flash forward 18 months later with Sanders being released as part of an intricately planned maneuver by the still relentless Clenteen which involves implanting a microchip transmitter in Sanders' jaw (don't ask) whereby he can trace every move the ex-con will make (naturally in the path of the inevitable gold; smart huh?) Sanders hooks up with his crime loving brother (Epps) and reunites with his girl (Elise) who is skeptical and has Sanders' baby to prove he better be talking the talk and going straight. What follows is just another pedestrian script of letting some throwaway one-liners by Foxx and the usual pyrotechniques by the film's ridiculous climax involving Bristol menacing his family and an elaborate set up at a race track. Foxx squanders his natural talent here and needs to re-focus his film path (he was great in his semi-dramatic turn in `Any Given Sunday' last year) and continue re-fining his comic skills on his tv series.  The film is an embarrassment to himself and to his fans.

In fact, it would appear that if ANY movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2. Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people.This movie was an Action/Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be. And for an Action/Comedy, it was very well done. I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a Jamie Foxx fan, and having the over-used plot that it has.The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours, etc. etc. etc.) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist. Now the bad guys are actually the good guys and the REAL bad guy is an uber-geek.Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film.If you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in The Matrix or a drama such as Of Mice and Men then this movie isn't for you. But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you.

Comedian Jamie Foxx, an alumni of the esteemed In Living Color television series, may be a funny guy on the small screen, but he simply lacks the star power to get airborne and rise above the personalities that surround him.In fact, he more or less drowns in the sea of talent that makes up the rest of this movie as central casting seems to have done a great job in finding the right actor for every role but the main one.For example, we have David Morse, who looks and acts remarkably like Russell Crowe, playing to near perfection Edgar Clenteen, a tough cop who will stop at nothing to find his man.Then there's Doug Hutchison, whom many may remember as Percy Wetmore, the spoiled brat turned prison guard in the Green Mile, or as the evil cyborg Elroy L in the television series Space Above and Beyond. This time he plays a soft-spoken sociopath with enough eeriness to run Satan out of hell.And don't forget Robert Pastorelli as Jaster, a desperate ex-con with a bad heart looking to make one big score if not for him, then for his wife. Or David Paymer as Agent Wooly, the nervous but reliable assistant to the firey Clenteen. Even in their limited roles they exude personality plus.Foxx, on the other hand, has all the prescence of a wet dishrag as he more or less shuffles along, yammering away in some sort of barely decipherable hood talk that rarely rises above annoying and never to funny.   A better choice for the central role would have been someone who does a lot less talking and a lot more acting. Even Ice T has shown the ability to speak a thousand words with but a single, tortured facial expression.   Fortunately, the storyline is such a good one that Foxx's faults can almost be excused. Reminiscent of the heroin-addict-turned-unwilling-assassin in La Femme Nikita, we instead have Alvin Sanders, played by Foxx, a two-bit shrimp thief, who becomes the `bait' with which the authorities try to draw out a ruthless mastermind who not only stole $42 million worth of gold but killed two security guards in the process.The twists, the turns, the crosses, and the double crosses make for great suspense, made all the more exciting when the pawn discovers that he's a lowly yet pivotal piece on a very complicated chess board.Too bad that as even as an underdog, Foxx is difficult to cheer for.

Part Enemy of the State because whenever Sanders has the bug on him, you have that thought in the back of your head telling you that no matter what Sanders is in, he is being heard by the feds.

You would basically be playing the same role you did in IN THE LINE OF FIRE.  But still, it looks pretty good.  You could have some fun with it.  I'll send you over the script and you take a look at it.   ( After reading the script, John carefully considers it and decides that he does not want to play another Mitch Leery/Booth, so he passes on the film, even though it looks like a pretty interesting script.)  So who is the next best choice to play the heavy in this film?  How about that guy who kills the mouse in GREEN MILE?  Yea, he is a perfect Malkovich.  So the producers get Doug Hutchison to play the heavy in Bait and even though he does a very admirable job, one can't help but to compare the two characters.  There is especially one scene where he tells Alvin that the only reason that he is alive is because he allows it and those words are almost taken right out of the screenplay for IN THE LINE OF FIRE.  But, having said that, the question is, is the film any good?  And the answer is YES!It's too bad the producers of the film didn't know a thing or two about release dates because this one got swallowed up in it's first week and made just over 5 million dollars.  This originally had a summer release date and they pushed it back for whatever reason, perhaps thinking they would wait until the summer films ran their course and the public was thirsty for another Martin Lawrence/Eddie Murphy type film.  But even if they would have released this film a month or so ago, it may have finished second or third in the weekend sweeps, but it still would have made more than 5 mill at the box office.  Now this film will probably end it's domestic run with about 15-17 million and if it was released earlier, you could have added about another 20 million to it.  But hey, not my problem.This film works for many reasons, one of them of course being Jamie Foxx, but more so because of the story.  I like how the script called for Alvin to figure out what was happening to him and it smartly unravelled the mystery for him.  It was an intelligent script and along the way it had time for some humour as well.  But not quite as much as I expected considering how funny Foxx is.  But no matter because the film kept me entertained and hey, not everyone can do the BEVERLY HILLS COP/BAD BOYS thing to perfection.  I also like David Morse in his role as the tough as nails investigator that seems to hold a personal grudge against Alvin.  He was always p***ed about something where as the rest of the surveillance team seemed to be growing to like Alvin.  It was also kind of interesting to see Morse and Hutchison in another movie together ( they were both in Green Mile ).As for the ending, I have to agree with other people that have said that it is quite impossible for the money to be where it was.  But hey, that's the movies for you.  Not possible, but a nice way to end the film.Bait is a good action film with a twist of a mystery in it and it is a very good film.  Foxx shows that he is quite the serious actor when he needs to be, just as he did in ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  I think this is one of the surprises of the year.  It isn't as good as a film like GLADIATOR or THE PATRIOT, but it is certainly better than most other films that have disgraced the screens this summer.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"This movie was far better than I expected.

It's okay. It plays with the busted gold heist, gives the star a wisecracking urban adorability, and holds the audience interest through the end. It's heavy on the high tech, illegal surveillance angle. I lost count of the number of monitors the feds have as they track the Jamie Foxx character, so I hope they got a good deal at Circuit City. The movie does a lot with a little. For instance, in the first scene, we see Jamie Foxx and a friend about to rob a seafood warehouse for a couple of thousand dollars. Foxx makes a point to his friend -soon to be a coward- that they aren't hitting a shrimp joint. They're prawns. Foxx gets a lot of mileage from that exchange. Jamie Foxx is quite funny with the faces and the one-liners. However, it means the film is flipping between semi-comedy and murder/thriller styles. That's hard to do. The suspense of the film is compromised by one thing. The tension of the last half-hour is based on the threat that the mastermind of the gold heist will kill Jamie Foxx's girlfriend and baby. It became clear to me early there was no way she and the baby were going to die, so that punctured the anxiety the movie wanted as a timebomb ticks down to the inevitable explosion. Finally, the ending of the film is preposterous. You don't see it coming, but when it comes, it's beyond my capacity for belief. Given the fact that the gold heist was busted, it's hard to understand how in the world the film's conclusion could have been arranged when the bank robbers were clearly in a state of confusion and duress. It's an attractive conclusion, shot with an aerial perspective, but it wasn't supported by the facts in evidence. I think Hitchcock or somebody like him said you have to design a film so it's immune to refrigerator logic. That's when the viewer of the movie gets home, decides to grab a bite, and when he is at the fridge, he thinks about the film, There's no way that could happen. That's the ending.Still, it's a good action film, it goes by quickly, it has a few laughs, and the photography is very good. Ebert was right, three stars.

He's then used as bait to bring down gold heister Hutchinson.While Bait appears to have been meant as a star vehicle for Foxx, it makes little use of the actor's comedic charm and instead chooses to spend too much time on its dumb, meandering plot.  None of the characters feel genuine, cliches abound, including an all-too-familiar digital readout from a time bomb, a team of government officials wearing headsets and clicking away at computers, who end up look more like Time Life Book operators than agents, and a hard-assed, humorless cop bent on just capturing the criminal.  Then there's Hutchinson's cool, deadpan delivery as the computer mastermind who resembles John Malkovich not only in appearance but in menace, feeling like he was lifted right out of In The Line Of Fire.  None of these things offer innovation and make the movie pretty stale.Jamie Foxx's character is the only worthwhile reason to sit through this pedestrian action/comedy effort.  He's fun, sexy, has a likeable air around him, and generally gives good comedic delivery.  If you don't like his character at the beginning, give it time.

His tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role.  Once again Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater.  Morse ends up coming down hard on Hutchinson.  They are both perfect for this scenario in each film.  I personally love that quality in a film, where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film, as these two did in The Green Mile.

Another well known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from Scream and Three Kings. The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was pretty good and also funny, but the one who most surprised me, was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He plays a different character than he usually does, because in other films like The Green Mile, Indian Runner, The Negotiator or The Langoliers he plays a very sympathetic person, and in Bait the plays almost the opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see. The only really negative thing about this film, are the several pictures of the World Trade Center, which makes this film perhaps look a little dated.

While it is not the greatest Picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. If painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. Typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. You will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. Well, this concept of children's artwork is how I felt about Fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film Bait. While on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see Fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. If you have seen either Training Day or King Arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film Bait. While Foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define Fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. Sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why Fuqua's name appears on so many Best Of&#133; film lists.I will never disagree with someone that Fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. His ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. I am surprised that more of Hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon. Even in the silly feature Bait, you are witness to Fuqua's greatness. Two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. In both of these scenes I saw the director Fuqua at work. Alas, in the rest of this film, all I saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. The likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in Hollywood. We have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are Charlie Kaufmann), you cannot recreate the wheel. It is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with Bait. I was annoyed with Fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. I was just tired of the structure, and while I hoped that Fuqua would redefine it, he did not.Then, there was the acting. While Jamie Foxx has never impressed me as an actor, I was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. I wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to Collateral. I was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that Foxx could handle the role in Collateral. Again, I was disappointed. Foxx was annoying. Not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither Fuqua nor Foxx took the time to fully train Foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot. Instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of Foxx just trying to make the audience laugh. Adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. Fuqua should have stopped this immediately. Foxx's jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. Instead of character development, he would crack a joke. Neither style worked, no joke was funny. The rest of the cast was average. By this I mean I have seen them all in similar roles. They were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. They were pawns filling in dead air space. Fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.Overall, this was a sad film. With no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. Foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. In each scene I saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. Are my words harsh? I don't think so. When you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. Bait contained none of these. While I will give Fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. Apparently, I took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully I can stop others from taking that curious nibble.Grade ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were fun to watch) "},{"Title":"Nothing Original, yet entertaining.","Date":"18 December 2005","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" The Good Much like a train wreck, you can't help but watch.

One of the reasons why I was so impressed with Foxx's performance in Ray was because from watching his hammy, obnoxious acting in movies like Bait and Booty Call, I would never imagine he would ever hold the Oscar. If people told me five years ago that Jamie Foxx was one day going to win an Oscar, I would laugh right in their faces. Who knows? Maybe he's better off sticking to drama, because if you watch Bait, it's clearly evident that comedy is not his forte. I swear, Jamie mugs so much in this movie that I'm surprised his face didn't fall off. And why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets? Anyone familiar with comedians like Bob Newhart and Steven Wright knows that doing comedy doesn't require being loud and obnoxious. If a joke is funny, it's funny. If it's not funny, then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier. The problem I have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character. In real life, normal people don't always have witty comebacks and quips. Like Albert Brooks said in an interview discussing his character in Taxi Driver, it's important to be funny as your character, rather than be funny as a comedian. A prime example of Jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken, and he starts posing for the photographs like a model. If a regular person were being thrown in jail, would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken? And wouldn't the police try to scold him if he was? There are many scenes like that throughout the film. Another awful sequence is one where Jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain, and he starts doing a phony Caribbean accent. Not funny! Not to mention Jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke. Giving a comedic performance requires patience, whereas he goes straight to the punchline, whether it's the right time for it or not. I'm not even a big Mike Epps fan, but even his performance is good in comparison to Jamie's. As a matter of fact, this is the first time I felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen. Epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy, but at least he chooses a more low-key approach. One of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is David Morse, a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains. He seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality. However, fellow Green Mile star Doug Hutchison is disgustingly over-the-top as the villain. A big surprise, considering he gave a superb performance in The Green Mile, also playing a heavy. Antoine Fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like The Replacement Killers and Training Day. Even in Bait, he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence. His only problem seemed to be in disciplining Jamie Foxx, who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another. Unless you're a die-hard fan of Foxx, please don't take the bait.
