A rare and great performance by Madonna. She actually can act under the control of the right director. Although, I hear she hated. It seems ironic that she finally makes a good movie and doesn't even realize it. I guess she made some complaints that she thought her character was going to be stronger. (Funny, if she wants to be a Feminist Avenger, or some kind of role model of strength, maybe she shouldn't have made a career out of exploiting herself for fame and the all mighty dollar. Okay, now I'm ranting, but isn't funny how men are especially really down with the NeoFeminist Bull about how it's actually empowering for women to exploit themselves.) Ferrara plays with the autobiographical nature of the subject matter. The plot centers on a film director who compartmentalizes his personal and professional life, until the secrets of his professional life overwhelm him.

Eddie has one brief affair with Sarah but he feels also affected by his work and confesses the truth about his many infidelities to his wife Mad Israel (Nancy Ferrara), blurring fiction and reality and destroying his marriage.Dangerous Game is a sort of experimental movie within a movie showing a parallel journey to hell of the character, lead actor and director blended with sex, drugs and booze. The result is a strange and unpleasant movie but very well acted, especially by Madonna that has a magnificent and very convincing performance. It is not entertaining and certainly not the best film of Abel Ferrara, but for fans like me it is worthwhile watching it. My vote is six.Title (Brazil) Olhos de Serpente (Eyes of Snake) "},{"Title":"it's a difficult and flawed film, but it has some very strong merits in the Ferrara vein","Date":"3 January 2007","Score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" As a follow-up to Bad Lieutenant, which could be a possibility for director Abel Ferrara's best work to date (or at least most thought provoking), Dangerous Game aims for lower targets while trying for a similar approach to the dregs of a character's soul. Once again Harvey Keitel is the doomed figure, a man with such a self-destructive impulse that it'll lead him to nowhere decent. But this time he's not a cop on completely the edge of society and self, but a movie director who is making a film with such high-intensity, raw emotional drama that it would make John Cassavetes wince. The main actors in Eddie's movie (Keitel) are Sara (Madonna) and Francis (James Russo) become victim to that old tune of art imitating life, or vice versa (as the chicken came from the egg and back again sort of thing) that starts to make the film within Dangerous Game a very volatile situation. All the while Eddie's demands on his actors involve spiritual death via drugs and alcohol and mutual decay towards one another, an abusive relationship where the sexual games have gone sour and all that's left is remorse and contempt depending on the beat. Soon this seeps out for real, as Francis can't distinguish from acting or reality, and a rape scene within the movie becomes all too real on the set. And, of course, this leads further for Eddie's own path of horror.Unlike Ferrara's previous film, this time Keitel's character doesn't have that possibility for redemption- in Hollywood, in search of the most brutally honest picture, Eddie Israel won't stop until he practically gets what he's got bottled up inside right onto screen, no matter what it does to his actors whom he professes to enjoy and be friendly with (and with Sara more-so). He indulges in drink and more importantly women via the movie business, while still keeping up appearances with his wife (Nancy Ferrara) and little boy. So with this lack of Eddie meeting towards any kind of possible sign of hope- and keep in mind the Herzog clip from Burden of Dreams- it's almost despair for despair's sake. And watching the scenes being filmed by the actors(The Mother of the Mirrors), though not totally awful, I'm reminded of the old Gene Siskel line about the actors eating lunch being more interesting than the movie itself. Still with these flaws noticed, not to mention a very strange ending that leaves off the character's in some kind of demise either real or filmic (maybe it's the point), it's still a good film, or rather a film that defies its own experimental boundaries to be always fascinating, if only to a film buff like myself.I liked individual scenes very much, like one where Keitel's character directs Madonna's Sara into delivering lines to the camera believably by insulting her as a 'commercial whore', to which she finally gives him what he wants (it's something that is sometimes mentioned among directors or other actors trying to get believable turns by the other actor), or in seeing the a very understated scene where Keitel and Madonna do a slow dance out by a pool and he sings a soft tune. I also loved the scene involving Keitel and Ferrara (how she's related to the director I don't know) when he reveals to her his major transgressions as she has returned home for her father's funeral (just casting her, too, is wise in showing someone very believable as a person in Hollywood's good & normal side). What helps too is the willingness of the principle actors to just give it their all, as if they'd kill to get what they're doing right for the director, murky script and all. Truth be told, I found this to be a real high point for Madonna as an actress, not playing some easier part to play like in Desperately Seeking Susan or League of Their Own, but having to actually tap into her more decadent side that she loved (at the time) to make as a part of her media image. Russo, too, is good here, if maybe almost dangerously one-note as a man so intense and method that he threatens the whole production.Finally, there's Keitel, who never ceases to amaze me with what he can do even in moments when the material gives him little to do but to look off in a scene with a stare or expression of inner-hell. Actually, that's one of the things he's probably perfected since the 1970s. He has moments where he bends his demanding exterior, and there's tenderness to be found within the self-destructiveness in Eddie. The only problem then lies with Keitel lacking a means to really channel this into something leading somewhere- by the end his character doesn't know what he'll do with the film, or how to finish it, and this sort of abrupt ending leaves the actors as well as the film in the cold. But as a film about film-making, I've seen worse, and I might even like it more if I catch it late one night on cable (definitely *that* kind of movie).

Dangerous Game is good and bad for many reasons.  First.. It's confusing...but mainly because you don't know where the characters who are playing characters start and end. But that also may be what the director intended.Second.. the editing.. it was rushed or done on equipment that was of little quality. There are times when the dubs are not with the video.. some parts are a mess.. but again.. intended or not?Thirdly the acting.  Keitel is ... well... Keitel... not too much of a stretch.. Keitel, Russo, and Madonna often times seem to improvise... few lines seem scripted.Sidebar on Madonna and acting...Madonna usually has a shining moment or two in most of her films, but more often than not Madonna and acting don't mix.  I can say that because I am a Madonna fan.  Madonna is the Queen Of Deadpan, she says a line and... NOTHING.  She seems to be thinking about her next line while the other person is speaking, which hinders delivery and expression... plus she blinks WAY too much.  Those are her biggest acting flaws... DIRECTORS TAKE NOTE... I summed it up... VOILA!But I digress...In Dangerous Game, Madonna shows us some of her BEST ACTING TO DATE! There are countless scenes where she is not left to carry the film.  She lets her hair down and is actually believable.  The scene near the end.. with Keitel actually egging her on to get a REAL reaction. You think you're so smart... is BRILLIANT!Finally... Often times there are scenes where the director seems to use genuine behind-the-scenes footage of Madonna, Keitel and Russo.  Sadly the only reason I say this is because Madonna's acting is too good and her performance too genuine.  This again confuses the audience.  Intended or not?This film is extremely choppy... very gritty... very dirty... very raw... very sick...  very violent..but very boring in some sections...I didn't enjoy this film the first time I saw it, and often times I fast forward through scenes when I watch it today.  But, the film does have some quality to it that makes you ask...  Was that supposed to happen?  Is that Madonna or Sarah or what?  Did they?  Did She?  Oh My!If you like a movie where the ending is not black and white you'll enjoy Dangerous Game.

An aspect of this particular movie that appeals to me is the play between various kinds of cameras that were used, as we see the director played by Harvey Keitel rehearsing his actors James Russo and Madonna, sometimes video footage is used. The different kinds of media create a variety of textures, all the way from the beautifully lit shot of Keitel and Madonna flirting at night by the swimming pool, to a grungy looking clip, blown up from Les Blank's documentary on Werner Herzog, which Keitel watches on TV. A precedent for this kind of thing, which Ferrara would go on to play with in his later Blackout, also about movie-making, is French New Wave director Jacques Rivette's 1969 L'Amour Fou, in which 16mm footage is intercut with 35mm. Rivette's film is also about actors and their offstage dramaturgy. Bulle Ogier in this case is certainly more appealing to watch than Madonna, and the text Rivette's players are working on, the classical play Andromaque, is more stimulating than the Mother Of Mirrors script in Ferrara's work. Nonetheless Dangerous Game continues an intriguing cinematic tradition, that encourages us to look more carefully at the surfaces of the images we are watching, not just to pay attention to the story or the dialogue.To fully appreciate this play of textures, a viewing in 35mm (such as that recently offered by San Francisco's Castro Theatre) is better than trying to suss it out on DVD or tape.

And of course Madonna, who (unwittingly?) gives the best performance of her much ridiculed celluloid career.The film revolves around director Eddie Israel (Keitel) and his supporting cast members in their journey to film the uber-dark relationship drama 'Mother of Mirrors'. Starring alcoholic drug dependent Francis Burns (James Russo) and recent Christian convert Sarah Jennings (Madonna) the film within a film blurs over into real life, leaving the viewer confused about whether the actors are acting their character in 'Mother', their character in 'Dangerous Game' or even their character in real life. The confusion even seems apparent on set, with one directors clapper-board shots with the movies real director A. Ferrara noted on it.In reality, Ferrara had to resort to accepting finance for the film by Madonna's Maverick Films and thus also accepting its MD as his leading actress. Madonna once said that when she attended the premiere she left the theatre crying as it was in her eyes a completely different movie, and all her best scenes were cut. Dig a little deeper with this one and you might be able to see the underlying story which is far more interesting than what's bubbling on the surface.

In the story her character get to be in the movie only because that way the director can finance it, and he despises her for being a commercial piece of sh#$) you'll see that Madonna mocked herself in the movie, but she didn't realize this until it was too late. It's even captured on film the exact moment she understands this. When the director Israel is rehearsing with her (him reading the lines from the other actor), when she can't get in the right attitude, he starts ad-libbing insulting her big time. He taunts her saying she's a commercial piece of sh$%, and reminds her that he doesn't need her, she needs him (she WANTS to be in this movie) and as he angers her immediately encourages her to say her lines, and at first Madonna looks REALLY puzzled and, as Israel says do the lines, you commercial piece of sh$%, do the lines..., suddenly she looks as she realized something, and gets really pi#$% off, and after hesitating for a second, says her lines real good. Well,  I think that was Madonna not acting, but realizing that all those insults were directed not at her character, but at herself personally (the director Israel played by Keitel obviously represents the actual film director and writer Ferrara) because that's what most likely Ferrara and Keitel think of her as and actress.I know, sounds too elaborated, but think of this she's not a good actress, so that reaction (looked way to real) must have being real, not acted out. And all the similarities between her character and herself are too many and too obvious to be coincidence, and all the insults were dead on. So Ferrara and Keitel gave a piece of their mind (also Russo for that matter) and got away with it. If she wants to be in an artsy film, she has to take it up the @$$, again as her character takes it from Russo and many others according to their home movies.

In Bloodhounds of Broadway, she delivered a finer and funnier version of her Who's That Girl character, and the world went unperturbed; similarly, when Abel Ferrara released Dangerous Game it played in legitimate theatres for about a week and then completely disappeared. Well, that just means you all have to go out and rent it--but don't expect too much from the film itself. The plot concerns a film director (Harvey Keitel) making a disturbing film about an abusive marriage (James Russo, Madonna), that is so harrowing to film that the events on-set seep into the real lives of those working on the picture. Ferrara never actually makes the connection between these two events strongly enough (the strongest indication I had about it all happening was that it was described so on the video box), and you're left with the impression that Keitel's character is more selfish and overly self-indulgent than disturbed. Russo is strong in his performance, but his character is so unlikeable and he doesn't manage to find any humanity in it, so it destroys his effectiveness. Madonna, on the other hand, is unbeatable as the actress whose accustomed commerciality and professionalism is challenged on a set where no holds are barred. You'll be amazed at what she's capable of, as well as disappointed that when she finally gets to work with such a great director she ends up in one of his worst films ever. Ferrara's real-life wife Nancy plays Keitel's bewildered wife, and does a heartful job that is quite memorable even though she's obviously not a professional actress.
