You know that when the bad guys are circling him, taunting him, telling him what they're about to do, you know that within less than a minute, everyone around him is going to be lying on the ground, moaning in pain, while he stands there smirking.  Literally everything in his reach becomes a weapon and he NEVER kicks.  Also, he ALWAYS comes out scratch free. His character will almost always be clad in leather, even when everyone else is walking around in Summer wear.  Yep, he's a regular Jack of all trades in this one as he's an Enviornmental Protection Agent, a pilot, a carpenter, a martial artist, and a guitar player as well.  It's so absurd, but yet SO satisfying, it's just the way action movies should be. No one else could pull it off and do it so well. Lotsa fun. Steven Seagal plays basically the same character in every movie, and while they're always panned by the critics, his movies always please the audience that they were intended for.  Fire Down Below is, in my opinion, the last of his really good movies.  Everything else kinda went downhill from there.  With Fire Down Below, he took his preachiness from On Deadly Ground, and toned it down a little.  Also, he wasn't directing this time.  But one thing I have to say is that I could've done without the sped up action sequences.  There were a few times, throughout the movie, where I thought that I may have accidentally hit the fast forward button on my remote.  But other than that, this movie does what action movies are supposed to do and doesn't pull any punches.  I also enjoyed the Kentucky backdrop and it was kinda cool to see so many country musicians make cameos.  Marty Stuart, Travis Tritt, Mark Collie, Kris Kristofferson, Levon Helm...they're all here, not too mention several others.  My favorite character was Cotton played to perfection by one of my all time favorite character actors Harry Dean Stanton.  His mountain-boy simplicity put a big ole smile on my face everytime he showed up and I love the guy in everything he's in.  Everyone in the movie seems to be having a great time and it's so hard to take anything seriously.  All you can really do is sit back and have a good time.  I hope that for his next film, that he ditches all the glossiness of Exit Wounds and goes back to the movies that made his audiences love him in the first place.

There is a gallery of good actors in support like Harry Dean Stanton and Kris Kristofferson. Special mention should be made of Stephen Lang who although playing a murderous character does make one feel sorry for him. Also Marg Helgenberger gives a touching portrayal of Sarah Kellogg, ready to bloom after years of repression. The photography of the landscape is beautiful and contrasts with the story about its despoliation by illegal dumping of chemicals. This film is more about character and story. The fight scenes themselves are quite brief.Which brings us to Steven Seagal. His bland acting style works strangely enough in complement with the other stronger actors.He does the combat OK. He does preach (like in his more recent films) but hey, what's wrong with looking after the environment? This film is under rated and deserves another look.

I have visited those places in Eastern Kentucky shown in the movie. I know that there are places in the mountains of Kentucky where outsiders are distrusted due to a tradition started by Revenue Officers many years ago. My grandfather was one of them for many years! I also know their traditions and customs and very much of this movie shows people as they really and truly are today. However, as in most places, the diversity is also notable. For every person hooked on country music, for example, you will find another, or others, who are not.As a person with one year of karate and one year of jujitsu, I can also agree with another reviewer that Steven Seagal's expertise in Aikido is demonstrated, as was stated, by not merely breaking bones although it can be done. The axiom in martial arts is to protect yourself and this does not always mean putting the opponent in the hospital. Therefore, the fight scenes were believably adequate and enjoyable. Those with only a moviegoer's experience in martial arts would see it otherwise.Snake handling? In Texas and Florida there are experts who would think that Taggart's grabbing the rattlesnakes tossed through his bedroom window was driven by what he had to do at that moment. Many of those snake experts can tell you that they have known others who had to grab a snake to avoid being bitten. No big deal but still exciting to see. The country music entertainers were actually excellent actors. I was impressed by them. None of them fell down in their roles and they came across as entirely believable. The story may be seen and appreciated without finding the actor-musicians to be bumbling idiots but real people.One reviewer commented on the marijuana patch in the hills. This also is not an imaginary or unbelievable situation. Many small planes do not dare fly low in those hills or they come back with bullet holes from those who think they are being overflown by ATF people looking for their weed plots. Bodies have been found in marijuana patches so this also was realistic.I like Seagal and have seen him in several movies. He is an expert in his field. However, a man who practices martial arts can get hurt more by accident than by intention. However, he is considered great at his art by those who are experienced in that field! Most people in martial arts would love to be as good as he is. Anyone who would denigrate his abilities would not be capable of standing off a pickpocket on a crowded bus and going beyond this would just tax their imagination.The story was good because it happens... Toxic waste is being stored and hidden not only in Appalachia but in other parts of the USA. The story holds together well. Also, the scenery is very well chosen and this is a plus.People from that region do not make comments about the movie being untrue to life there. This is because apparently the producers/directors were careful to adhere to authenticity and they did well.Anywone who likes martial arts and a good story linked to beautiful scenery mixed with reality will like this movie. Others would be better off to stick with their video games to avoid boredom.I enjoyed the movie -- several times. Overall, I give it a big 10.

I really wasn't that familiar with her when I saw this movie a couple of times in the late '90s, although I had seen her before. However, now she's a very familiar face thanks to the hit CSI television show.Anyway, the movie was a typical Steven Seagal film in that he's the likable hero, you had despicable villains that were easy to hate, and every action scene is Rambo-like in which Seagal never misses injuring his foes. One big difference in this film from his earlier efforts an emphasis an aesthetic cinematography. This had some beautiful rural scenes of Kentucky and in particular, a church on a top of a hill, in which a number of scenes take place. Not only is the country scenery nice but there are some good country songs in here and better yet - blues guitar music in the background throughout the movie. All of this was different for a Seagal film. Of course, the nice scenery was probably due to the fact Seagal played an Environmental Protection Agent (Jack Taggart).Also different was the fact that Helgenberger (Sarah Kellogg) was not the typical gorgeous young sexpot normally paraded out in these martial arts films, but was rather plain with no makeup. She wore conservative clothing and showed no skin. (Contrast that to her CSI roles the past six years) Then again, Appalachia being the setting for this story, her dress and manner was appropriate and realistic.Language-wise, most of the hard profanity comes from Kris Kristofferson's villain character, Orrin Hammer, Sr., in the first hour. How they treated religion in this film was bizarre. Good, bad, good, bad - like watching a tennis match. The country reverend was the typical Hollywood wishy-washy minister the kind would NOT see in this area in real life. The screenwriters are so clueless Seagal called him - a Protestant minister - father - as if he was a Catholic. Anyway, the wimpy reverend does come around at the end. More examples good-guy Seagal bows his head in prayer at church but also tells Helgenberger that I don't hand out bibles. He also mentions UFOs and Zen to a sick little boy but also mentions God's work other times. He covers all the bases, I guess, from occult to the real thing. The bad guys attend church, but then they burn it down! Harry Dean Stanton tells someone that church people talk down the others, but the next scene something positive is shown. I'm telling you the theology in here would make your head swim. Seagal plays a smug kind of guy but his smugness doesn't translate into an offensive jerk, perhaps because his character is so soft-spoken and he is, after all, the good guy. Every action scene in here is a Rambo imitation in which Segal beats up his opponents no matter how many of them are against him. It's ludicrous. Yet, most of the time it's enjoyable enough to watch and the sound-effects on those fights are actually entertaining, almost humorous. About the film, I still like the blues guitar and the Kentucky scenery the best. The rest of it is pure Seagal nonsense....but entertaining.

'Fire Down Below' marks the beginning of a successful change of  focus for Mr Seagal. Gone are the bone breaking fatal blows that really are not what Aikido is about anyway. The martial art scenes are done with speed and precision as always but are not over the top. After all, Mr. Seagal is a 7th Dan Black Belt Aikidoist. Martial Art freaks who want blood and guts can go and watch 'Mortal Combat'.  The Mine Scene was a bit disappointing, a little unbelievable, but I did say this was the beginning of a change of focus. Gone is the basic Seagal signature type 'here comes the hero' music. Sound track is great - and yes he writes his own music and yes he can play the guitar. The scenery was great and cast, well it's as if they radiated Kentucky - I could feel it and I'm from Australia. I would have liked a little more passion at the end.  Mr. Seagal seems a little ill at ease, but it may be a reflection of his own uneasiness with commitment, who wouldn't be after three marriages. All in all I liked it very much. I look forward to 'The Patriot' and 'Blood on the Moon'.

Seagal plays EPA agent Jack Taggart, who moves to a small southern town to investigate allegations that a major business figure (Kristofferson) is dumping tons of toxic waste into a supposedly safe area. Seagal faces much hostility while he is there from Kristofferson's thugs, but he meets and falls in love with a young woman who was falsely accused of murdering her father. The murder was really done by her brother, who ends up in a dangerous confrontation with Seagal. This movie had expert action scenes and great filming of a southern/midwestern town.

This film covers just about every aspect of American society, possible!Besides an incredibly well written story, great acting and terrific cinematography, Fire Down Below also teaches us how to be courageous! Sure, most of us don't have the fighting skills of Steven Seagal, but his most dangerous weapons are his intelligence and his passion to stop evil in its tracks. Something we all can strive to do in our own lives!

The story, and contrary to reports otherwise there IS a story, formulates quickly, and moves along at a nice pace. The action is Seagal's akido stylized bone-crunching extravaganza.Marg Helgenberger is extraordinary in this work, giving her performance more than one might expect from an actioner like this.It's quite enjoyable, features plenty of action, a solid story that doesn't get lost along the way, and delivers a couple of hours of real enjoyment.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend .

I looked up the song and found that it was sung by Bob Dylan on his 1989 album O Mercy ( http//www.bobdylan.com/songs/coat.html ). There are numerous parallels between the story and the song; long black leather coat worn by the stranger, references to a dance hall, preacher's sermon, smoke on the water, Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force.It may be coincidence, but I wonder if the story to this movie was inspired by the song or if both the song and movie had a common inspiration...

There is punching, kicking bad acting and low-budget amusement. The problem with Fire Down Below is that Seagal does more talking than he does fighting and of course he is not very good at that. He gets a lot of one liners (many of which he probably improvised) but he doesn't deliver them very well. Because Seagal can take out any number of bad guys regardless of the time and place, there is really no conflict in a movie like Fire Down Below and ergo, no sense of even a moments tension. This is why the movie is neither thrilling nor riveting or any synonym, it is just amusing, at least it is enough so to make it worth watching if there is nothing else on.Seagal is Jack Taggart a fed (and a carpenter) who is sent out into the Kentucky hills to investigate the possible dumping of toxic waste by a crooked mining corporation. Because the locals are getting payed off, they don't really want Taggart around. Can he persuade them to make a stand or is he gonna have to bring down the big money single handedly.I can't say the fight scenes are very inventive or elaborate but the sound mix is surprisingly effective. Even though it is comprised mostly of stock sounds, it delivers a punch, especially in one sequence which is taken right out of Duel where a diesel truck goes over a cliff. Seagal's guitar in the background is nice every now and then, but the soundtrack otherwise is badly mixed. Steven Seagal movies are dumb, but they can also be fun. I suppose this could have been worse, but it is one of the Seagal films that I'd recommend.

Boring concept followed by numerous fight scenes before concluding pretty much the same way. Director Felix Enriguez Acala is working with material that has about the same value as diarrhea. Even the production is boring. Seagal spends 90% of the film in combat where he beats up dozens of people including cops. I could only shake my head as some big lout threatens him and he beats the sh*t out him in short order as well as kicking around a bunch of his buddies. In lame supporting roles is Marg Helgenberger who clings to Seagal while he beats up her abusive brother. Harry Dean Stanton is far too valuable for this sh*t. Kris Kristofferson plays the standard villain in a role that is totally beneath him. Stephen Lang plays Helgenberger's nasty abusive brother who will end up with Seagal's foot up his ass.

Again here's another good actioner, with one hell of a message, that will have minds, questioning the value of human for the sake of some millions. We really get to see Steve one last time, on the screen, bust up some heads, and stomp on some toes. Like On Deadly Ground, this seems another personal project for Steven, who's attempt of a hillbilly accent can only be described as what the fu..? Should of just let it slide. He's an agent for the EPA, investigating the suspecting dumping of pollutants, which are killing the little fishee's and some of the town folk, making them very sick, prefore. Also one of his agents was shot, investigating this operation. One pretty town woman has sourly been given the wrong end of the stick, where she's not very well liked, well her protective brother is working for the baddies. It's another interesting play of background story here, in a movie better than you expect, despite David and Margaret, passing it off as (sarcastically) Yeah, can't wait. And really as a boss bad lead, Kris Krisoffertson, was interesting, but not sufficient. He played bad better in Payback. Some of Steven's lines near the end of the film, cracked me up too. This film really leaves no detail forgotten either, regarding straightening out Kris Krisofterson's son and the other punks, plus delivering through on a promise. For Seagal Cinemania, this wasn't a bad pic to go out on, and has more to offer, than you originally think. Seagal is still in need, of an acting tutor badly, though.

In order to get to the truth about a large, illegal toxic waste-dumping scheme, he goes undercover as a handyman in rural Jackson, Kentucky, where the waste is said to be hidden. This toxic waste is causing the townsfolk to develop medical issues, and is even killing them. While Taggart finds friendly locals like Cotton (Stanton), Reverend Goodall (Helm), and Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger), who he forges a relationship with, he does end up with a lot of opposition to his even being in their supposedly quiet little town. As it turns out, the sinister Orin Hanner (Kristofferson) is a corporate bigwig who is using the townspeople of Jackson as his own personal enforcers against Taggart so he can continue to make millions with his waste-dumping scheme. But Taggart vows to end this cycle of corruption and misery - by any means necessary. Will Taggart and his friends triumph over the forces of environmental evil? Find out today! You know, it's a funny thing...we've been so conditioned by Seagal's latter-day efforts, that we assumed watching this older Seagal vehicle was going to be a crud-filled slog filled to the brim with mind-numbing stupidity. But we were very much refreshed and relieved to find out...wait for it...that Fire Down Below is actually a solid, worthwhile, and entertaining movie. Yes, that seems shocking, but that's only based on the 2014 view of Seagal. Hark back to a time when he was a little thinner, his movies went to the theater, and the major studios ensured some level of professional quality. Seagal is as likable as Seagal gets, and he even smiles a few times. Plus his jackets are truly amazing fashion pieces. (Hence, we ventured a supposition that his full name in the movie was Jacket Taggart). This was in Seagal's Environmental phase, where he wore buckskin coats and all his movies had to be about pollution or rainforests or something. Somehow his interest in that seems to have faded, as his latter-day DTV efforts seem to have him more as an unlikable thug.If Hard Target was Van Damme's Bayou movie, than Fire Down Below is Seagal's answer to that. There's plenty of banjo-pickin' country music on the soundtrack (a lot of which is by Seagal himself, with none other than Todd Smallwood of Street Knight musical fame...what an amazing team-up!), and the first image of the movie is highly reminiscent of the cover of classic SNES game Phalanx. But the idea of a butt-kicking EPA agent who becomes Undercover Handyman is an enjoyable idea, but the whole classic corrupt small town feels very familiar.But here's the bottom line as we see it Because this is a rural movie, which is very well-shot and has a nice atmosphere, and has a refreshing emphasis on actual characters, it seems the movie as a whole would have gotten more recognition and critical acclaim had it starred Billy Bob Thornton or Ed Harris instead of Steven Seagal. Take out some of the action scenes, and this could have worked well as a low-key drama like Chrystal, Paris Trout or Sling Blade. But because this is a Seagal movie, it ran into a dilemma As a drama, it's not going to please drama fans, and as a straight-up action movie, it runs the risk of upsetting action buffs who have to have everything go at a breakneck pace with tons of brutal violence. We suppose the intended audience is...us, really, because we appreciate actual storytelling, atmosphere, and characters, as well as action. But we applaud Seagal and the rest of the cast for actually trying to make something respectable and not your average crud.So set your newly-minted (and extremely warranted) modern-day Seagal prejudices aside and feel free to delve into the world of classic, pre-obese Seagal. We're not afraid to say we thought Fire Down Below was a winner.

I think that the majority of his films are not making good use of Mr Seagal's unique talents. His quite demeanor, fighting skills & good looks. He should be doing films more on the line of what David Carradine excelled in, which was his TV Series Kung Fu & Kung Fu the Legend Continues. Betwixt the two, the only obvious differences in Kwai Chang Caine & Mr. Seagal that I can discern is that Mr. Seagal does display a breaking point in regards to his temper & he likes girls. I saw him in concert in Laughlin. NV back in the 90's, my only comment was his soft speaking manner, even at the concert, I was in the front row, I did ask him to speak up. His expression was one of questionable politeness, and to mine and everyone present, he did speak a mite louder. This film displays that man, meaning the man who was giving the concert. BTW... IMDb states his role in Executive Decision to be a cameo, how can anyone refer to a part lasting nigh on 45 minutes, a cameo. In regards to the statement Seagal considers him to have been the most important martial arts teacher in his life. I find it hard to believe that anyone would have trouble understanding this... It should go without saying that each man/woman, for good or ill, is their own best teacher, only they themselves can make use of what another teaches them & until the individual understands this, their knowledge & skill can not be put to it's best use. Unfortunately most never do. Yes, this film is his sure-fire best. If you haven't sen it then put it on your To Do list, if you have, then see it again, it's an hour & 45 minutes well spent.

Despite Steven Seagal's colourful jackets, this is actually a very entertaining action film. In my humble opinion, two things make it recommendable. The first is the heroine, excellently played by Marg Helbenberg, who brings lots of humanity to her character. It is a pity she did not have a more expressive actor to react to her (although Seagal is good in the action bits which, after all, are his thing). The second (and foremost) is the last scene, the one with Harry Dean Stanton singing and dancing in his newly built porch. Stanton (especially remembered for Paris, Texas)is one of those actors who have been there for ages but never became a star, whose face is familiar but whose name escapes us. The scene reminds me of that character in The Searchers, who only wanted a rocking chair in a porch in his old age. It is an homage to a veteran actor, a secondary in hundreds of classic westerns and also an accomplished musician. Watching him play Kentucky Waltz made me wish the credits rolled forever. A 6 for the film and a 10 for this scene.

With a bit more to say about the evils of dumping toxic waste into rivers streams and valleys and less action scenes. Where Seagal holds off as long as possible until he's provoked to put the bad guys away. Even Seagal voice never raises barely above a whisper during the entire movie. What I also noticed about Seagal was this unusual walk he has, or developed, in the film. this walk of his reminds me of a bull gorilla or orangutan in the wild when their about to confront their natural enemies whenever they invade their turf.Taggert gets the word from his EPA boss Chick Larson, Blue Deckart,that his good friend and fellow DPA agent Frank Elkins, John Diehi, was killed investigating toxic dumping in rural Kentucky. Before you know it Taggart is off to find out who's responsible for Frank's death. Taggart uses an undercover disguise as a Bible toting carpenter who doesn't take any pay for the work that he does! This is taking the Bible quote Money is the root of all Evil a wee bit too far!Not fooling anyone with his preacher/carpenter stichk Taggert is quickly recognized as a government agent and made a target of the man who controls the county as well as state big time strip mining tycoon Orin Hanner Sr, Kris Kristofferson. Taggart is confronted by one of Orins major underling his smucky and snot-nosed son Orin Jr,Brad Hunt, and his local band of enforcers sheriff Tubbybear Llyod, Ed Bruce.Trying to get friendly with the people in the area Taggert only makes a splash with Sarah Kellogg, Marg Helgenbergan, who's not only shunned by the entire community but is about the only one in town who doesn't know that he's a government agent. It later turns out that Sarah has a deep dark secret that the very on the ball Taggert seemed to have spotted right away this has to do with her creepy brother Earl ,Stephan Lang. When it came to figure out that he was being manipulated by members of his own the very intuitive EPA man Taggert was completely clueless to the point where he almost had Sarah as well as himself murdered by them.Finding out where Hanner is storing, or dumping, his toxic waste Taggert again letting his guard down even though he knew that he was being set up. Taggart ends up blowing up almost the entire state of Kentucky leaving it contaminated and unlivable for the next hundred years; so much for Jack Taggert, or in real life Steven Seagal, being concerned for the environment.Taggert really gets into action when he has it out with Orin Jr and his gang Working Good O'l Boys. Taggart works them over so effortlessly that you wonder why they just don't come to their senses and walk away from all this mindless carnage! Why didn't they just just go out fishing and forget all about their job as hired but very ineffective Mafia-style muscle men for The Man Old Man Hannan. Getting wimpy Orin Jr, who together with his band of goons, to turn evidence against his old man,Hannan Sr, Taggert later has it out with him and his bodyguards at the Hannan Casino. Taggert as usual knocks everyone out cold, with his fists feet and gun, even though he was unable to prevent Hannan from killing one of the FBI agents who seemed to be there just to get shot! It's as if that scene was put into the movie so Hannan could be charged, among all his other crimes, with the murder of a US government agent.A bit better then you would expect from a Steven Seagal movie with the beautiful and breathtaking Appalachian photography as a nice backdrop to the story.

I can't think of too many action stars (with his popularity at the time) that would've been bold enough to tackle the subjects he preached about head on. I'll end by saying, Fire Down Below was the beginning of Seagal the Actor (not just Action star). I just don't know what happened...maybe bad management or loss of vision on Seagal's part, (maybe both...maybe neither).

Like On Deadly Ground, it sends a good message, and Seagal's speech was cool again, plus there were some really cool fight scenes in this!. The characters are all cool, and the plot is pretty cool, plus the finale is great!.

As i said this is not a great film and it has it's fair share of flaws, however it's enjoyable, with great performances and a good story, and i say it's well worth a watch!. The Direction is good. Félix Enríquez Alcalá does a good job here, with great angles, good camera work, great shot of the truck falling off the cliff, and keeping the film at a fast pace!. There is a little bit of violence, a lot less then a regular Seagal film. We get lots of bloody broken noses,bloody car accident victims,,teeth knocked out, and a few gunshot wounds.

Well, it wasn't hard, as Seagal only had three movies between this and 'Under Siege' (not including 'Executive Decision'), and one of those was the rather average 'On Deadly Ground'. 'Fire Down Below' is essentially a better version of 'On Deadly Ground', but it still doesn't compare to the awesomeness of 'Under Siege'. Few movies can.Jack Taggart (Seagal) is an EPA Agent / Professional Ninja / Carpenter extraordinaire assigned to investigate a company illegally dumping chemical waste near a small town in Kentucky. Naturally, the company dumping the chemicals is rich - very rich - and the only way Taggart is going to put the bad guys away is by beating up any bad guy in sight. Awesome.'Fire Down Below' takes the same message from 'On Deadly Ground' (the message being that rich mining companies are EVIL) and presents it in such a way that may even cause you to think, but doesn't beat you over the head 'Captain Planet' style. Angry naval commanders may not team up with with former spies to take over U.S. Navy battle ships every day, but there are big corporations that have been recklessly poisoning our planet day in, day out for the last century. I'm such a long-haired, left-wing pinko, much like my hero, Steven Seagal. Awesome.'Fire Down Below' suffers from the same lack of action that plagued 'On Deadly Ground'. However, instead of playing out like a 'Captain Planet' episode, the film takes time to create a better, more thoughtful story than that of 'On Deadly Ground'.

It's a seagal film, but it takes place in a small country town. the soundtrack is county and the whole film screams country (until the fight scenes kick in). Something new and fresh, and i admire that.As a whole, the film was much better than expected because it's different than a lot of action films that take place in the city and whatnot. this film had heart, and even though seagal can't act with emotion too well, you can still notice that this film is better than average for what it is.RATING 7/10 "},{"Title":"...and this time its personal!","Date":"2 August 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  'Fire Down Below' is, for my money, Seagals best outing since 'Out For Justice.

Part of this films strength is the way the viewer is co-opted into loathing the red necks enough to cheer Seagals martial artistry in whupping red neck butt.The environment, corruption, rednecks, justice and a little sermonising, literally, from Seagal himself all make for a highly enjoyable film.

I have seen her in a couple of other movies such as Erin Brockovich and she is my favorite character on CSI. So naturally I jumped at the chance to see her in yet another flick. She plays opposite Steven Seagal; who is Jack Taggart an agent sent undercover(for about five whole seconds of the movie) to a tiny hick town, to try to find a witness that will testify to the suspected dumping of toxic waste in the coal mines near the town. Along the way he encounters love, a car chase, many brawls with various people, another car chase,a burning church, and many other so called obstacles. Yet much of this did not catch my interest. His character was too much like a superhero. He could do it all. EPA agent, martial arts expert,carpenter, ladies man, and guitar man.I can understand that it was meant to be an action film and characters aren't necessarily developed as much, but the action sequences did not catch my attention.There was not one second of internal conflict within our hero. In one, Sarah Kellogg(Marg Helgenberger)was being transferred into protective custody and Jack just starts chasing them...I was like whoa, where did that come from? Did his gut just tell him they were bad? He was already running to the car before the imposter agents had even began gunning it out of the parking lot. So I guess we're adding ESP to the list too??? But I tried to overlook the bad main character and focus on my original goal....Marg Helgenberger's character. I absolutely loved her! Her character was the outcast of the town, having been accused of her father's death when she was 16. She was vulnerable yet had a very distinct strength about her. I also liked her soft southern drawl, it was very appealing.It was a nice change from her more self asserted character on CSI. There was an interesting substory about incest that caught my attention, but it never went anywhere. This movie, i believe had potential. It was sunk by bad acting on Steven Seagals part(yes his soft-spoken voice,that i could barely hear,is supposed to be threatening), badly written dialogue, and an ending that wrapped up much to fast( though I love the shot before the credits where Cotton Harry was dancing on his porch with his guitar). All of the supporting cast namely Harry Dean Stanton(cotton harry)and Marg Helgenberger are quite good, despite a badly written script and dialogue. It seem to be a fascade of an action movie, there isn't really all that much. What there is, isn't good and isn't necessary(Do we really believe that those cops couldn't arrest Taggart?? Hell yea they could, even though they had no evidence or witnesses at all). I will give it 5/10 just for a great supporting cast whom i feel bad for because they had garbage instead of lines.

So far in my opinion they've all been a waste. His film debut Above the Law was a load of junk and followed by such failures as On Deadly Ground, Under Siege, Executive Decision, Under Siege 2, The Glimmer Man and Exit Wounds. The sad thing is that a lot of those movies grossed more money then they should've. I admit some of them had potential (Under Seige and Executive Decision mainly) but they fall short. Is it because of Seagal? Is he cursed with bad movies? Maybe. He's gotten far off of his martial arts but not his acting (just like Jean-Claude Van Damme). I would've never seen this film unless my friend hadn't convinced me it was better than Under Seige (at this time I hadn't seen Under Siege yet which was better but not by much). So I sat through this film and took it all in. Which wasn't a lot but enough to be able to write this review about how bad it is. OK, so let's discuss the paper thin plot this film contains. A band of local residents/hoodlum punks of some unknown Kentucky town have been dumping toxic chemicals into abandoned copper mines up in the hills. They're being paid millions upon millions of dollars by commercial companies who dump the junk and run. These punks consist of local guys and the head hancho Orin Hanner Senior (played by Kris Kristofferson) and as you can guess Orin Hanner Junior is the smaller hancho overseeing the operations in the town while Senior sits in his big office in some city and makes the deals to dump the chemicals. Now these operations have been going on while kids get sick and fish die (all the usual Hollywood cliches that surround environmental problems) while the locals have been scared or bribed into submission. But one man, one loner/outcast has come to clean up this mess single handedly. And what a surprise it's Steven Seagal! I bet you didn't know that was coming. I have to admit that the first half an hour of this movie wasn't too bad because it surrounded the actual problem of the mines and all that scientific mumbo jumbo surrounding the testing for toxins. But as in most Seagal movies your lead astray right when you think it has potential. Small stupid little subplots arouse and jade the real interesting plot and useless romance arises from where there should be no romance. Let me give you some examples of what I'm talking about The kid going to the bathroom upstream from Seagal while he was taking water samples, the lone marijuana plantation out in the woods, all the scenes surrounding his sentimental carpentry, Seagal's love interest and her psychotic brother, need I go on? And why was Randy Travis in this movie! Just because he contributed to the soundtrack he gets a bit part? Come one people, he's on screen in a useless scene just to get shot like 3 minutes later. Or the bees? Oh my god the bees are on fire!!! Are we supposed to feel for these bees as they go down in flame and glory? I know I sure didn't. Or the scene with the flare being thrown at the guy surrounded by gasoline? Gas burns in vapor form not liquid! Why hasn't anyone picked up on this one yet? Seagal must have had REALLY good aim to be able to put out the flame of that flare with one bullet. Lame, lame, lame. And also, how could ANY local law enforcement even if it was being bribed not put Seagal behind bars for beating up police men even if he is part of the EPA? Not to mention all the other people he always seemed to take down with no problem. I have to give it some credit for that exhilerating car/truck chase during the middle of the film. Never since Spielberg's TV movie Duel has a truck flying off of a cliff looked so cool! I thought that this was a boost in the film but I was dissapointed once it was over to see that nothing had changed. So in the end I think that Seagal should just focus on his meditation up in the Himalaya's and leave the whole movie scene behind him. Besides, meditation is healthy for the mind and soul, where as this film, isn't. 2/10           "},{"Title":"A typical Steven Seagal movie!","Date":"10 September 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This movie has everything you expect from a Steven Seagal movie the usal conscience preaches and the funny combat-scenes!

When his boss ask's Jack to go into the town undercover to gain the people's trust & bring his friends killer's to justice he doesn't need to be asked twice, Jack goes undercover as a charity worker connected to the local Church carrying out small carpentry jobs for free for those who need it. It's not long before his asking too many questions gets Jack into trouble with the local bad guy's, the local police & rich millionaire Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson) who wants to keep his waste dumping a secret...The feature film directorial debut of Felix Enriquez Alcala I have to admit that I was really disappointed in Fire Down Below, I've stuck with Seagal over the years because some of his earlier films were pretty good while some of his later ones are just plain hilarious & he made this for Warner Bros. when the films he appeared in still had decent budgets & actually opened theatrically. The script by Jeb Stuart & Philip Morton takes itself extremely seriously & even has Seagal's character make an impassioned speech about the environment that wouldn't be out of place in a Quincy (1976 - 1982) episode! This film foolishly tries to have a strong environmental message behind it which just falls flat on it's face, for a start this is one of the slowest Seagal action flicks I've seen & contains little in the way of excitement. The character's are horrible, the dialogue is terrible & Seagal gets to play the guitar, ouch. Then there's the end which is a bit of an anti climax as nothing really happens, sure there's a couple of brief fights but one would usually expect a large action set-piece where the hero & the villain finally meet, not here as Seagal simply arrests the bad guy's & that's it. I'm sorry but I don't want to see Seagal arrest people & do things 'by the book', no I want him to shoot everyone in sight, beat people up, crash cars, blow things up & generally cause lots of mayhem, I mean is that really too much to ask?Director Alcala does OK but the story really drags, badly. I really can't think of another either duller or slower Seagal action flick. The few fights that are here are pretty cool since Seagal made this before he piled on the pounds, that pony tail still looks gay though as does the stupid looking multi coloured coat he wears in this. There's one shoot-out at the end & one mildly entertaining car chase as Seagal is menaced by a huge Mack semi truck while trying to mind his own business in his pick-up... The violence levels are low for a Seagal film, there's no gratuitous nudity either.This probably had a decent budget & it's no surprise Seagal never made another film for Warner Bros. after they saw this & it convincingly bombed at the box-office. It's well made but forgettable & the action set-pieces are dull & nothing we haven't seen before. The acting sucks which is a shame as there's a good cast here including Harry Dean Stanton & Kris Kristofferson. I was just looking at Seagal's bio page on the IMDb & it states that his very humble sounding nicknames are, wait for it, Lord Steven & The Great One! Excuse me, Lord Steven no less! Who on Earth gave him these rather lofty sounding nicknames?Fire Down Below is probably Seagal's worst big budget action film that he made for a big studio & is more of an environmental drama than straight action, look Steven just stick to what your good at like beating people up in a variety of painful looking ways & leave stuff like acting to the professionals. Personally I think this film sucks big time & apart from one half decent car chase is rubbish.

Seagal masquerades as a do-gooder helping people with his carpentry skills and living at a local church, but mogul's cronies are on to him and try to chase him away.The plot kinda reminds me of Clint Eastwood's 1985 Pale Rider (which borrowed heavily from Shane). A lone stranger comes into town and befriends the common folks, saving them from the evil tycoon and his motley crew. The difference is that Fire Down Below is an Eastern rather than a Western and it takes place in modern times. Seagal may not have the supernatural overtones of Clint in Pale Rider but his heroics are so fantastical he comes off a bit supernatural just the same.Seagal, of course, is a highly likable protagonist. He's ultra-confident, cool and soft-spoken at all times; and he knows how to kick some serious arse. Numerous times throughout the film he takes on multiple attackers and wins without even breaking a sweat. Unbelievable? Yes, but Seagal makes it believable. He is, after all, 6'4, dressed in cool black threads and a master of all kinds of martial arts.Some say Seagal's a bad actor, but this isn't true. If someone is giving a bad acting performance you can tell because there's an awkward air to their delivery and you don't buy them in the role. This is not the case with Steven. Never for a second does the viewer question Seagal as the protagonist. It may be the only character Seagal can play, but he does it well.Plus Seagal has numerous great one-liners throughout the film. For instance, late in the film he confronts his EPA colleague who has sold out to Kristofferson and says, You're a piece of s*** and I'm ashamed of you. The line is perfect and perfectly delivered, not to mention so true-to-life. Hasn't anyone ever betrayed you, abused you or disappointed you to the point where you finally give up with the realization that they're just a shameless and shameful piece of s***?One of the best highlights for me is the gorgeous Appalachian locations and cinematography. The picture was filmed on location in SE Kentucky -- Hazzard, Mt. Vernon and points between to be exact. I feel Appalachia is largely under-utilized in filmmaking and greatly enjoy it when films take advantage of this magnificent area of the USA.Seagal's romantic interest is played by Marge Halgenberger, who became popular a few years after this film starring in TV's CSI. She's very believable as the local infamous woman who has a strange relationship with her brother, played by Stephen Lang.Another highlight is the blues/country music heard throughout the picture. It turns out that Seagal wrote or co-wrote many of the songs featured and even performs one on camera. I never even knew he was a musician! There's even a country-ish Jimi Hendrix song. Plus a couple Country stars make cameos, like Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt.FINAl ANALYSIS Fire Down Below falters a bit in the final act but, other than that, I love this film. It has everything you'd expect in a film that takes place in hillbilly country -- good family folks, rednecks, poverty, coal mines, brawls, alcohol, pot farms, backcountry churches, incest and country music. The best feature for me is the genuine Appalachian locations and photography. Add likable Steven Seagal to the mix and you have a winner! As another reviewer has stated, Seagal has a totally winning personality -- a hero with a heart of purest gold. He's certainly someone worth emulating in my book. In fact, in this film he represents all (or most) of the qualities of authentic manhood missing in our current society that celebrates effeminized and weak men (another good example would be Clint Walker in 1966' Night of the Grizzly).Lastly, I should warn action fans that this is hardly an all-out action film. Yes, there are action pieces interspersed throughout, but they flash by with a few blinks of an eye. Fire Down Below is a drama/action/thriller wherein the story plays out fairly leisurely, but with bursts of great violence. Although Under Siege is technically a better film and arguably Seagal's all-time best picture, I personally favor Fire Down Below for the reasons cited above.The film runs 105 minutes. GRADE B+ "},{"Title":"Flush this down below.","Date":"27 March 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" An EPA agent Jack Taggart (Seagal) is sent to go undercover in eastern Kentucky to find out who's responsible for dumping toxins in the ground. Of course in a film like this, there's a friend of Taggart's who's dead, so he has to avenge him. The locals, mostly poor are too afraid to make much noise about who's doing it for fear of reprisals. So Taggart strolls into town and starts doing odd jobs for a church fixing up some local's porches, playing the fiddle and then meets the female lead Sarah Kellogg (Helgenberger). It's just as bad as it sounds. I like to the scene where he grabs the rattle snake lighting quick, I guess I'm not the only one who saw Hard Target. Pretty soon he gets into fights with the local trash and as always dominates and finds out that Orin Hanner Sr. (Kristofferson) is the guy behind the whole operation. Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending.This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse.There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars. "},{"Title":"Steven Seagal Versus Hillbillies!","Date":"17 December 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Steven Seagal movies are truly an acquired taste. These zero-risk melodramas boast an invincible champion, slime ball villains, and disposable bystanders. Zero-risk because you know the villains are going to be vanquished. Seagal never loses. The Seagal hero kicks butt and leaves little behind. That is the problem with this soft-spoke martial arts master's epics. Everybody around Seagal dies, while our invincible hero tiptoes through the mayhem as if he were weeding a garden.The typical Seagal hero is a career lawman or military intelligence spy who may be temping at another job, like the cook that he played in the immensely entertaining Under Siege. Seagal has perfected an acting style that can only be described as minimalist. His range of expressions is limited to that of a Cyborg. Seagal heroes are strictly one-dimensional. When he fights, he never moves from his position any farther than it takes to toss an adversary. Taggart is a flesh-and-blood version of a Terminator. The only thing that makes Jack stand out in a crowd is the colorful coats that he sports, neatly buttoned up to conceal his gargantuan girth.Worse, the Seagal hero has no Achilles heel. All of the best heroes possess one, and this makes them vulnerable, sympathetic and believable. It is the chink in his armor that makes him more interesting than the villains. Plus, the villains have a legitimate chance to kill him like Superman with kryptonite. Usually, however, Taggart emerges without so much as a scratch. Seagal is as inexorable as fate when he descends upon his enemies.The villains in Fire Down Below are about as dirty as dishwater. Truly memorable villains in beer & pizza actioneers must be slime balls, without a shred of humanity. As the chief villain in Fire Down Below, Orrin Hanners (Kris Kristofferson of Convoy) spends most of his time on the phone in his executive office in his own skyscraper cheating on his spousal unit. When he does come out to tangle with Seagal, the fight is one real yawner. Hanners presents so small a threat to Taggart (Seagal) that he does not even bother to kill him in the end.Marshal Jack Taggart of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency wings his way into a tiny, isolated hamlet in the rolling hills of Kentucky to find a hidden toxic waste dump as well as the murderers of a friend and colleague. Yeah, there is toxic waste in them thar hills! The Jeb Stuart & Philip Morton screenplay has bad guy Hanners making a millions by stashing toxic chemicals in abandoned mines. Sadly, the Kristofferson villain is not as much fun as the Michael Caine nemesis that Seagal took down in his previous environmental-thriller On Deadly Ground. All Kristofferson gets to do is snarl at his grown-up, knuckle-headed namesake Orrin, Jr. (Brad Hunt of Blow). Yokels come after Taggart disguised as Federal Agents, one of them is none-other-than country music crooner Randy Travis. These villains, however, topple like ten-pins in a bowling alley. Taggart even defies the local constable Lloyd (Ed Bruce of Public Enemies) who threatens to summon 300 federal lawmen.Predictably, Hanners tries to trap Taggart in the mine with the toxic chemicals. This rates as one of the better plot ploys for the slimy villains. Even if they cannot deliver (kill Taggart), at least they have a grand scheme. All villains should have grand schemes. So Fire Down Below preserves the invincible Seagal hero, but the villains are strictly vegetables who are slashed from the vines. They are not as well-armed as the villains in the Under Siege movies. Most of the time, Taggart delivers a brutal punch in the guts or takes them by their hands and brings them to their knees.One of the disposable bystanders is Sara Kellogg (Marg Helgenberger of the CBS-TV show C.S.I.). As Kellogg, Helgenberger is an outsider in the community. Her reputation was ruined years ago during a murder trial; it seems that she was accused of killing her father. This is a big subplot in Fire Down Below and one of the few interesting things about this lackluster melodrama. Taggart is searching for a witness to bring the bad guys to justice. Eventually, he convinces Sarah to talk. His first resort is the kindly preacher Reverend Bob Goodall (Levon Helm of Coal Miner's Daughter) who gives Taggart room and board in his church. Reverend Goodall qualifies as the sacrificial goat in this movie. When he finds his civic backbone, the villains break it. Actually, the villains are good only when they have complete advantage over the weaker. Helm gives one of the best performances in Fire Down Below. As Cotton, a poor custodian in overalls, Harry Dean Stanton is another bystander who takes Jack up on his offer and agrees to testify against the villains. Naturally, the villains beat poor Cotton to within an inch of death. The filmmakers always distract the invincible hero while the slime balls do their dirty work. Nevertheless, you know that Taggart will triumph in the end. These pathetic louts are good of a couple of laughs, but even they fail to add anything to Taggart's statue. Meanwhile, the Kristofferson villain is a corporate pirate who is willing to shoot anybody down in cold blood if it serves his purpose. He does not show his true colors, however, until the last reel. Altogether, Hanners is not much of a villain because he is simply too bland.Even by Seagal standards, Fire Down Below is below average. There are few good lines of dialogue. When Orrin, Jr., tells his dad that he ill take care of Taggart, his contemptuous father observes that he could not pick up take-out fast food. Fire Down Below contains scenery that is more interesting than the dull, routine plot. Finally, do not confuse this actioneer with the 1957 Fire Down Below that co-starred Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon. Only die-hard Seagal fans will appreciate his opus.

Because after it, he made (The patriot) which was the worst anti-climax he could ever have. Then, and maybe out of the last one, he went down for 3 years away from the companies' confidence I think, to come back through Exit Wounds (2001) as the beginning of new less shapely, less starry Seagal who'll be in endless V movies after and not one decent cinematic one, as FDB, again to date.In brief; here's Seagal when you love to see him beating, not beaten !Here his belly wasn't that visible, his hair wasn't that awful, and his hitting was still present, artistic and effective (The thinner stunt wasn't here for him yet!). And as for the ponytail and the whispering style; these are like Seagal's abiding signatures. However he was delivering the goods in a good way would make you forgive the usual shortcomings (Believe it or not I loved his colorful suits!). In this movie you can have the chance to witness him smiles and more than once (yes!), plays the guitar; now you must miss badly all of these human details in Seagal of today !The plot was so solid. It's about a man vs. the corruption of a city. It reminded me sometimes of Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider, and some of Charles Bronson's movies as a modern cowboy. The tone of save-the-environment-to-save-yourself was available but with kind of nice characters and touching love story this time. It managed to be not incredibly violent like some other flicks for Seagal. I just didn't like the storyline of the marihuana's dealers since it wasn't used at all, along side the climax as it doesn't satisfy the viewer with suitable big finish that keeps itself as a good peak for all the rest of the movie.(Félix Enríquez Alcalá), in his feature film directorial debut, made a very thrilling and compact movie. The man who directed hundreds of TV works gave no moment you can call exaggerated or out of the story. The performance wasn't over the top in any way. The editing made a serious character for the movie. And nothing exceeded the other (the action, the story, the environmental enlightenment..). I don't know why (Alcalá) didn't make more cinematic movies.Seagal is strangely the producer or the executive producer of all his movies. I believe this is one of the very rare times in which I respected the material that he endeavored to make. Simply I didn't meet that smart Seagal much!It's the first movie I watched for Seagal and loved to re-watch it again. Look at him saying Stick around, we gonna have some fun... Damn he was cool !! I just hate this was!

Immediately locking horns with ruthless millionaire businessman, Orin Hanner(Kris Kristofferson)who's behind this corrupt operation, Taggart will have to battle his way through a veritable army of paid disposable hick thugs..it's good that his hands move as quick as lightning and that his martial arts skills are unmatched by anyone that even attempts to go one-on-one with him. Meanwhile, Taggart begins to gain the trust of the town who seem unwilling to speak against the culprits responsible for committing wrong-doing, his son Orin Hanner Jr(Brad Hunt)living in the community as a watchdog and mouth piece to daddy when trouble might halt the continual dumping of the hazardous waste removal. Aligning himself with a lonely local, Sarah Kellogg(Marg Helgenberger), whose scorned by the town for a scandal involving the death her father, Taggart will get a grasp of the current stranglehold concerning a community silent about what could endanger their livelihood. Orin Hanner will stop at nothing to see that Taggart fails in his mission to stop the toxic poisoning of innocent people..and Taggart will not stop until he sees that Orin Hanner is put away for good.Look, those entering a Steven Seagal ought to know what to expect..Seagal, in hand-to-hand combat, downing scum at warp speed, dropping his foes in seconds before they can even blink. Like On Dangerous Ground, an environmental eco message regarding mankind's poisoning Mother Earth is at the heart of the action. Instead of Michael Caine, it's a laid-back Kristopherson as the sleazy tycoon in tailored suits willingly allowing the notorious disposal of toxic waste upon a community who he believes he can control like sheep. Seagal remains as stoic and stolid as ever, unflinching and confident when it comes to incapacitating a number of hired goons. Yes, you get the expected bar fight as men are thrown through tables, pool sticks are of no use(..often broken into faces and across the body)and many are left in agony on the floor. There's your typical explosions which almost upend our hero(..at a cavernous site where the toxic waste in barrels are stored). The film also has a really sneaky, vile, and depraved villain in Stephen Lang as Sarah's brother, Earl..you immediately know the moment he appears on screen that this employee of Hanner is not to be trusted and has a lurking menace that's palpable. Also, we get an idea of unpleasant incest in how uncomfortable Sarah is when he draws near. Despite battling a Southern accent, Helgenberger(..this is before CSI)is right at home portraying these very vulnerable, down-to-earth female types. I think she does what she can in a rather thankless role, providing Seagal with a victim to rescue. No doubt, this is indeed a formula action vehicle, typical in Seagal's resume..anyone who attempts to fight him never stands a chance, and the ultimate target, normally a man of great means wielding his power from afar, his tentacles stretching great lengths, even influencing someone Taggart knows, will be taken down. Harry Dean Stanton, as Cotton Harry, makes the most of a minor role, the one responsible for informing Taggart of Hanner's abuse to his town's lovely area. The rural environment, to me anyway, was a fresh change of pace for Seagal, known for wiping out trash in urban locations. Country music is ever present in this film and you get a real sense of local atmosphere, where honest, decent folks are held quiet by the power Orin has over them. That fear is established and Seagal's character is infused into the community to eliminate it. This is really for fans of Seagal who can look past the familiarity of it all, accustomed to his usual showboating abilities to destroy baddies with ease.

The story takes him to the ridges of Appalachia where, as an undercover agent of the Environmental Protection Agency, he reveals the corruption that leads to the dumping of toxic waste in the pristine creeks of the dogwood-blooming hills of Kentucky.He meets some colorful characters along the way -- some good (Marg Helgenberger) and some bad (Kris Kristofferson). Meanwhile there's plenty of country music and down home cookin' and a-dancin' and sparkin' gals and church-going' and granny dresses and guit-tar picken'. The viewer knows it's all phony but somehow the art direction brings it off without insult, though the plot remains mired in cliché.Seagal's position isn't exactly clear. He's an agent of the EPA but he seems to have more than investigative powers. He can arrest sheriffs. He can even arrest his own corrupt boss. In the end, after numerous adventures, Seagal cracks a few heads, sees the toxic waste cleaned up and the bad guys punished.It probably couldn't have happened, legally, in 1994, the year of this release. The EPA is an investigative bureaucracy. It would never happen today for political reasons. The current administration appointed Christine Todd Whitman as its first EPA chief but she turned out to be a Republican of principle and in 2003 was replaced under pressure from the Vice President by a more compliant chief who was willing to go along with the higher arsenic levels in the drinking water that the administration wanted.Here's an example from Wikipedia of how the EPA works today An extensive online questionnaire responded by 1600 EPA staff scientists who have worked in the agency for more than 10 years has determined that they have been pressured to skew their findings. The survey included chemists, toxicologists, engineers, geologists and experts in other fields of science. About 40% of the scientists have reported that the interference has been more prevalent in the last five years compared to previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who are involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of our everyday life.

Posing as a church mission carpenter, he visits the town, uncovering a conspiracy to dump toxic waste in the abandoned coal mines in the nearby mountains by Orin Hanner, a shady businessman whose son runs the town. Faced with a wall of silence in the town & the presence of the dumpers, Jack attempts to expose the dumping & prosecute the people responsible.Film Review Faced with a dip in popularity during the mid-1990s, the action stars of the 1980s & early 1990s (Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Van Damme, Bronson & Norris) tried a variety of ways to continue their careers &#x96; Schwarzenegger & Stallone both tried their hands at comedy with varying results; Van Damme's popularity actually going up a notch for a brief time before crashing down so low that he became stuck in DTV land for the next decade; Norris turned to television while Bronson made a trilogy of DTV films before his death. As for Steven Seagal, the real-life aikido master, police officer (I'm serious), blues musician & actor (I was going to include CIA agent in that list of achievements but I'm not exactly sure if Seagal ever worked for the agency for real), he tried to reinvent himself as an environmental activist, making a trilogy of films in the mid-to-late 1990s that were eco-thrillers (ON DEADLY GROUND, Fire Down Below & The Patriot)&#x85; at least in basic plot thematics, that is.Excepting On Deadly Ground, these pro-environment films almost killed Seagal's career stone dead, mainly due to being ridiculously heavy-handed &#x96; the villains are all very shrill one-dimensional cardboard cutouts & clichés; the scripts are poorly written; & the most serious flaw of all &#x96; the action scenes are poorly staged.Fire Down Below starts out in a way that seems to indicate that Seagal is planning to forsake his customary martial arts sequences for some good old fashioned investigative skills. Not counting the short scene where Seagal stumbles onto a cannabis hydroponics farm, there seems to be a lack of anything that even remotely resembles the sort of brutal martial arts fights that Seagal's early films had showcased.But shortly after it starts, the film degenerates into a muddled blend of one-dimensional stereotypes, tepid car chases & poorly-choreographed fight scenes. There are two things I hate while watching films &#x96; having my intelligence insulted & being preached to (by that I don't mean social commentaries or satire &#x96; I mean films that beat you over the head with messages). Sure enough, Fire Down Below does both. I find it hard to believe that there could be a person (Kris Kristofferson's villain) so cowardly & stupid that he dumps toxic waste in his home town's mountain range. As for the acting, Kristofferson is actually a good actor, but here he has no motivation for his actions. As for the preaching part, the film lays on the let's-look-after-the-environment message with all the subtlety of a kick to the groin.All of Seagal's films (including the dreck that Seagal made during the 2000s) have this concept of White Hat / Black Hat characters (the White Hat is Seagal, while the Black Hat is a really despicable villain). Of course this scripting idea first manifested itself during Seagal's debut film ABOVE THE LAW & continues in this one, with Kris Kristofferson's businessman being an evil coward who spends his working hours in the company of female escorts.The other actors are quite competent in their performances, especially Marg Helgenberger as the love interest (I kind of liked the idea to give her a shady past, but the film indifferently throws this away by making her brother turn out to have committed the deed) & Harry Dean Stanton (Brain from John Carpenter's ultra cool sci-fi classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), who gives a good impression as the hick local who proves to be Seagal's greatest asset.

He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles On Deadly Ground, so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between Fire Down Below and On Deadly Ground is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like On Deadly...) and the violence/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In Fire Down Below the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat.In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains.The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against On Deadly Ground is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear. Again, it is a movie to wait and wait again for action and it will be a few good things in it. Director Felix Enriquez Alcalá made better with the TV film remake of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Thumbs down 'Below'.","Date":"16 May 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller","Review":" My Take Yet another Steven Seagal snoozer. When action star Steven Seagal was defenestrated in his last film EXECUTIVE DECISION, who knew he would have fallen this far. After appearing in hits like UNDER SIEGE that really deserved the hype and success, Seagal stars in this Thanksgiving turkey of an action picture, with a complete lack of one very important main ingredient Action. FIRE DOWN BELOW has a few fist fights, gun play and some chase scenes (none of which are thoroughly engrossing), FIRE DOWN BELOW tries to heavy itself with drama, including a series of scenes where Seagal has relationships with the other characters. The result Yawn! Could action movies be more dull and tedious.Seagal plays Jack Taggert, an EPA agent, sent to a small (and literally sleepy) town to investigate some illegal dumping of toxic waste. Kris Kristofferson, sleepwalking in the role, plays Orin Hanner, a crime lord who also killed Taggert's close friend. Worse, they're wrecking the town's environment. It's martial-arts naturalist-man Taggert to save the day, I guess. Other than fighting against thugs at the countryside, Taggert also has a relationship with a country woman, played by Marg Helgenberger and hangs out with city folk like like Harry Dean Stanton.There is one major action scene with a truck chase, but that isn't much to satisfy the film's overall running time. Director Félix Enríquez Alcalá moves things in snail's pace, with a quality of a low-budget made-for-TV movie of the week. The acting, especially by lead Seagal, is disappointing, some of which overly embarrassing. If the film could have been a straight to TV release, it would have saved more money to make it, and avoid more embarrassment as a big-screen effort. Recommended only for die-hard Seagal fans, but even they will find it immensely disappointing, and just downright a bad film.Rating * out of 5.

Jack asks three bad-olé' county boys as he is standing by a barn right next to their marijuana field. Whoa. I thought about that before mentioned movie and the only thing that I can come away with is how good it was that Burt Reynolds shot those country -inbreds and thanking God that you were not the one with the sore back-end!!!Fire Down Below, was a little of a 'departure' for Seagal I think. After heading down to Kentucky, (which is beautiful country) to investigate a colleague's death, he runs into all kinds of 'local' problems. And on top of that there is a local resident that also has a New York address that is causing major trouble in his own home state of Kentucky. Hanner (Kristopherson) is a major-Egocentic business man who has lost his sense of patriotism and manners, to boot. But Jack, (Seagal) is on his trail now! In the meantime, Hanner and his local Sheriff's department Lloyd, being that Law man, is running interference for the ever rich and powerful / popular Orin Hanner Sr. Seagal's Taggert takes up helping some folks in the county with small problems at the advice of Rev. Bob Goodall, (Levon Helm) who looks 'Road hard and put away wet' but you gotta love him anyway. The good Reverend is trying to help but is holding back until, Taggert confronts him firmly, (but nicely) the Reverend has a 'good' change of heart to help Jack endeavor to sort of flush out the evil players in it but ends up being too late. there is a sort of inside 'mole' working in the community and one that is working for the E.P.A putting the brakes on any investigation into Haner's activities in dumping chemical waste toxins. This moves at a good rate and is equally enjoyable with all the different personalities involved, from Mr. Cotton (Harry Dean Stanton) To Kristopherson, and Sarah Kellog (Marg Helgenberger -before C.S.I -fame) his love interest, who's brother is a killer and an incest rapist. But Jack is going to deal with him as well. Mark Collie, Ed Bruce, Travis Tritt ,etc. Recommended to country lovin' action movie lovers. (****)Hey!

If not, you're probably wasting your time. Sure, there's the interesting cameos and guest stars (Randy Travis, Travis Tritt and Harry Dean I don't have Travis in my name Stanton), but it's the same old Seagal formula.What formula is that, you ask? Well, Seagal is a federal agent with a gun and martial arts moves. He moves into a smaller town with their own traditions and falls for a local woman. A big businessman is upsetting the environment. After various fight scenes, the boss is confronted and there is more fighting. There are only two differences from past films here no Indian or Asian spiritualism and Seagal not once gets a scratch or anything on him, so there's no need to nurse him back to health. If this were a video game, Seagal would be using all the cheat codes. Also, the male-on-male rape jokes are never-ending in this film, so I hope you like big Bubba comments.That being said, I won't waste my time getting nit-picky about things you don't care about. Rather, let me just put it in the context of other Seagal films it's better than On Deadly Ground but not as good as Hard to Kill and not even in the same league as Under Siege. Hopefully that gives you a general idea for the level of quality you're in for. See it or don't, I don't care.

He comes head to head with Orin Hanner Sr &#150; a businessman more concerned with making a profit at any cost than in human life or the wellbeing of the planet.With a title that sounds like a doctor's note when prescribing a cream to help (`nasty case of fire down below') this film never held much hope of being brilliant.  However the full extent of just how very dull it is doesn't fully hit you until you've wasted your time watching it for a few hours.  The plot is as straightforward as you could imagine and is yet another environment first, preachy film to add to Seagal's list.  The fight scenes are all ordinary as he dispatches 6 men at once (as they politely queue up one at a time for him!) and, in terms of spectacle, only a truck falling a large distance is gripping.  Only at the end did the film have merit by going for a realistic courtroom finale &#150; sadly it is ruined by having a further 10 minutes where the bad guy is beaten in more traditional Seagal fashion.It may be because I dislike Seagal but the film is only poorer because of him.  He speaks in a constant whisper because he thinks it makes him sound tough, and he has the same semi-confused painful look on his face whether he is talking or being shot at &#150; he never seems to show emotion!  Helgenberger is OK but what on earth convinced Kristofferson to go for a simple bag guy role &#150; at least Caine hammed it up when he took on the environmental and Seagal.  Ol' Kris has little screen time and is distinctly unmemorable.  I can only assume the casting of Stanton was just to try and get some interest in the film with a character that has no value to the film apart from being Stanton.Overall this is preachy and dull.  The action scenes are simple and without flair and only twice did I enjoy them.  The rest of the film is too full of talk (or whisper in Seagal's case) and the fact that the central lead has, in this instance, all the charisma of a piece of rock, just makes the whole thing even harder to care about.

It is the complete worst, most horribly presented, badly written movie to come down the pike in years. The film is directed by Félix Enríquez Alcalá, mostly known for directing television programs and specials, who here is as focused as a two year old child full of energy. The film's writers produce the it with about as much smarts as a box of shredded wheat. The fight scenes are dual and the special effects are unsatisfying--all of which will be covered in my review, dedicated to keeping this movie out of your home. 	Lets start at the first act, which is presented through brief flashbacks, (coming from God knows who) and spoken expressions as the opening credits role by. The character explains that there is something happening in a little country village where villains are dumping toxic waste in the sunrise while the pedestrians watch patiently as their environment polluted. There's a cop assigned to investigate undercover in order to find a witness who will testify against the corporate animals in charge of these dastardly events. They are named Orin Hanner, and his son Orin Hanner Jr. who are both fat cat, greedy, businessmen who are only assumed, never actually developed.The undercover cop is, of course, played by Steven Seagal, who can't, nor could he ever, act. His character is named what other than Jack, and he is everything that the plot requires of him. He likes annoying country music, acts macho and sly, and stutters That's a nice name to most of the females he meets in the movie.  Jack is obviously the film's hero, and in movies like this, you have to expect him to be a man of many talents. Lets take a look at all the things Jack is, or, in other words, lets take a look at what the plot requires him to do and be· Jack is a karate expert and can take on several bad guys at once without receiving a single scratch on his body. Sounds like Walker Texas Ranger, doesn't it?· He is a snake wrestler.· He is a pilot· He is rich and resourceful.· He's a master of weaponry.· Jack is an insightful environmentalist. · He is also an experienced craftsman. · He's an undercover cop.· He can play the guitar.· He is a very intelligent engineer. · He is obviously a long time member of the sharp shooters club.	 Now lets take a look at the film's view on what character development and its nurturing of poor dialogue. First, I need to explain something called subtext, the dialogue that explains character's feelings, emotional qualities, and more or less develops the character; it basically taking the place of actions and events.  Naked subtext is mostly known as a negative quality. The examples of subtext in Fire Down Below are mostly present in character descriptions. This material is overwhelmingly existent in this horrible, horrible excuse for a movie. Sarah Kellogg, who is the film's heroine, is discussed among other characters as a nice girl, sad though, as she stares into the sunset. How touching. Not only is this material naked subtext, but not even said by the character in focus. It's like How Stella Got Her Groove Back, except much, much worse. 	The action scenes in Fire Down Below may appear to be tense and suspenseful, but when it all comes down to it, we know the outcomes in advance. Therefore, if you are an experienced moviegoer, you'll have no problem with seeing past the outer appearance of the violence.  For example there is a car chase scene involving Jack in a small car and a large construction truck. We know it will resolve with one of two outcomes. 1) Jack will be killed or 2) Jack will defend himself and triumph over the evil. Think about it if Jack is killed, the town in danger will be doomed because he is their only savior, therefore, if he is taken out of the picture, it will be the end of the movie. Can you guess what the outcome is, A or B? 	 For as bad as the action sequences are, you would be shocked about how much the film relies on them and the help of special effects and explosions to carry it through its overly long 105 minute running time. Sorry, but this film completely misses the mark. You see, most productions, even those as bad as this, start out with a story then add special effects and action sequences to raise the tension. Fire Down Below does exactly the opposite.				Brought to you by Warner Bros.   "}]
