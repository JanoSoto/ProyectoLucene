How ridiculous. This is a film that was made to entertain young kids, and it's entertaining enough for parents to watch along with them. My little boy enjoyed it, but then he isn't much of an intellectual, since he's only six! Anything that makes him laugh is okay with me, though. Also, I have to say that people are WAY too hard on David Arquette. I'm not a serious fan of his, or anything, but I feel bad for the guy when people trash him. I have noticed that it's mainly men who are so down on him. Gee, I wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that he's married to one of TV's most popular, attractive, and highly-paid stars? He seems like a perfectly sweet, charming man who is having fun with his life and enjoys making silly films. He doesn't seem to take himself seriously, so why do so many people hate him? It's ridiculous. Oh, and just to let you know, he doesn't get film roles because of his wife. He was acting before he married Courtney Cox, and he is actually quite a talented actor. If you don't believe me, check out a little gem of an indie film called Dream with the Fishes. He gives quite an engaging and touching performance as a man on the verge of suicide whose life is changed when he befriends a terminally ill man, proving that he CAN do serious dramatic work. He just chooses not to. So why don't you people lay off of him? Not that he cares either way, I'm sure. He is having the time of his life. You go David!

But first let me emphasize, that it really helps if you come to this film with no other preconceived notion other than that it is intended as a rather light, perhaps kid- or family-oriented sort of entertainment. It never set out to be a Schindler's List or a Gone With the Wind. But it still delivers some quality goods.I thought the film had some quality film-making behind it. The cinematography was just fine, the setting was beautiful (filmed in and around beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia - a city I've been lucky enough to visit more than once in my life), and the actors were all (to me, anyway) quite likable and enjoyable in their roles.David Arquette, whom you wouldn't ordinarily consider a comic, in fact does surprisingly well with the physical and often-times slapstick humor in the film. Michael Clark Duncan is really the sympathetic character here, playing a HUGE (and highly muscular) FBI agent who has an almost over-the-top attachment to the dog. The kid, played by Angus T. Jones, is really quite adorable, in fact I was surprised at how winning a personality he has (I don't always like child actors, sometimes they can be horrendous brats, but this kid was truly exceptional). The kid's mom, Stephanie, played by Leslie Bibb, was also quite charming (and always good to look at, even when she was covered in mud). Anthony Anderson, whom many of you may remember as Jamaal Baileygates (one of Jim Carrey's sons in Me, Myself and Irene) was extremely likable, and I was glad to see him in a role where he was not required to resort to vulgar language like he did in Me, Myself and Irene.Other roles in the film were also very well played. And last but not least, let's not forget the dog himself, who was at least as compelling as any or all of the other members of the cast. How they trained the dog to do some of those stunts that he did is way beyond me!This movie will probably best be enjoyed by families with young kids, and also by dog-lovers, as this film definitely made man's best friend look really, really good (in spite of the fact that they had about a whole five minute sequence devoted to the hilarious consequences of someone stepping in dog-doo at precisely the wrong time...).So if you want a thoroughly enjoyable light comedy with a dog theme, go rent it you won't be barking up the wrong tree, I guarantee it.

This film breaks the rule for many actors in not working with young kids or animals. My family and I really enjoyed it. If you are looking for something deep and meaningful then look elsewhere but if you want slapstick then this is for you. There is a very funny scene involving Spot's output and the catastrophe's that happen to the kid's mum (the gorgeous Leslie Bibb) who is also the love object for David Arquette, are very amusing. I think that the actors in this film must have enjoyed playing their parts and didn't take themselves too seriously. Overall this is not a demanding movie but just some good light-hearted fun and you will be crying with laughter.

As a joke, fellow carriers place a spotted stuff dog in his locker, making him jump. Very funny, says Gordon. But, the stuffed puppy comes in handy, for Gordon gives it to the son, James (Angus T. Jones) of a lady, Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) he has been courting. They all live in the same apartment building. Meanwhile, a talented police dog, Spot, has taken a bite out of a local mobster (Paul Sorvino), in the process of his capture. This goon vows to get the boxer cop so the feds decide to send the canine to a safe place in Alaska. However, the mob has one of their own planted as the escort and she arranges a different route to the mob headquarters. Spot, very bright, sees a way to escape and does so. He ends up jumping into the back of Gordon's mail car, where James is also riding, due to an emergency babysitting need of Stephanie's. Although initially petrified of Spot, Gordon grows to love him and James, too. But, naturally, the mob is still searching for the dog and the trail is not hard to follow. Will Gordon, James, and Spot be in captured by the bumbling mob henchmen? This an entertaining flick in many ways, despite humor that is more of the low-brow, slapstick variety. The cast is fine, the action rarely slows and, of course, the canine is adorable and expressive. Angus T. Jones, who went on to fame as the child in Two and a Half Men is very young and cute here while Arquette generates big laughs. Ditto the gentleman who plays Spot's partner in policework. The California setting, the costumes, the camera work, and the lively script/direction add up to fun. However, there are a few possibly objectionable moments. The mobster is bitten in the private parts area, which some will find sleazy. Also, a dog's shock collar ends up on Gordon and the remote in James' hands, with the resulting electrocution played for laughs but of which parents may find rather unfunny. There are one or two other such moments that could have been eliminated or changed. But, all in all, this movie will result in some big smiles for its viewers. Therefore, do See Spot and share it with others.

"},{"Title":"See Spot Act","Date":"2 May 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" This is a wonderfully funny dog film. But the difference this time is that the star is not a cute lovable pooch who wants to lick you all over, but a stony-faced, not to say also squash-faced, dog who is truly a dog of few words and of even fewer expressions. What is more, as an FBI dog, he has been trained NOT to play! So if you throw a ball, he just sits there and looks at you as if you are a child, which if you are a child, is true, of course. So this is a new approach to dog films, what you might call the Holden Caulfield Phase perhaps, since the lead role is now played by a kind of canine anti-hero. Is this a sign that dog films have matured? Or are they entering a period of decadence? Is the integrity of dog films threatened by this emergence of an unsmiling dog hero? But we must not think of this dog as an anti-hero in the sense of being a weakling or a cop-out. In fact, so far from being a cop-out, this dog is actually a cop. He is known officially as Agent 11, and is renowned as the FBI's smartest anti-crime dog. He can sniff a criminal a mile off, and he always keeps a sharp nose out at all times, because he knows perfectly well that in the human community, danger and crime are everywhere. So why is the film called SEE SPOT RUN? Well, you see, it's like this. Agent 11 has alienated a very dangerous Mafioso because in nabbing him he has bitten him in a man's most sensitive place (no, not his wallet, silly, you know what I mean!) And that guy orders two hapless hit men to go and kill Agent 11 at all costs. There are many comic moments when the two hit men (the only two creatures in the film uglier than Agent 11) bicker amongst themselves about this assignment which is beneath their dignity, and worry that if their friends ever find out they will never live it down and will be humiliated for the rest of their lives. On the other hand, if they do not carry out the assignment successfully, their Mafioso boss has made it clear that there will be no 'rest of their lives'. They keep nearly succeeding and in the confusion, Agent 11 escapes and goes underground, lying doggo as it were. He hides in the home of an excited little boy who wants a dog, and who chooses to call Agent 11 by the name of Spot, precisely because he has no spots, just as at that age I called my dog Rusty because she was black and white. We little kids when we are little can be really difficult and non-conformist, and some of us remain that way (those of us who are resistant to peer-pressure, that is). The casting of the little boy is very clever, because he too is not the cute cuddly little boy you would expect, any more than the pooch is. In fact, he is the kind of little boy you have to get used to because he is NOT immediately endearing. But he grows on you. He has a hysterical, shrieking, narcissistic single mother in a tight skirt. She is the only stock character in the film, the usual one without which no American movie is ever complete the embittered and angry ex-wife or ex non-wife, or whatever she is, but anyway she is angry and embittered. Have you seen an American film without one of these harpies in the past twenty years? Hopelessly in love with her (which shows such appalling lack of taste) is the highly amusing David Arquette, who has the advantage of having a touch of that attractive wistful look of his sister Rosanna. Arquette is a wildly wacky, hopelessly disorganised young free spirit who lives in a pig-sty, and has little in the way of financial prospects. The girl in the tight skirt has to go away for a few hours and leaves her little boy with Arquette, with the greatest trepidation because she considers him irresponsible, but she will be back soon enough and she risks it. However, Fate intervenes and she is delayed for days. It is during that time that Agent 11, alias Spot, becomes a family member. And then of course the hit men discover Agent 11's whereabouts and if the girl in the tight skirt had known about what was really going on she would really have freaked out, but she is too busy being stuck in the middle of nowhere through multiple mishaps, and her cellphone falls into a puddle as well, and oh yes, she is splattered with mud and you name it, it happens to her. (But she deserves it, because she is angry and embittered and narcissistic and she shrieks.) Well, what do you think? Do the bad guys get their way? Come on, this is a dog film. There are lots of laughs and lots of woofs. But no power on earth can persuade me to give away the secret of the ending, for a dog's word is his 007.

A couple of years later I saw it on TV and I had to record it on VHS. So without further ado here is the story.An FBI agent called Murdock(played by the late actor Micheal Clarke Duncan) is on a case in the opening of the film, where this mafia has illegal drugs that they hid in a painting can. So to solve it he sends his dog Agent 11 to sniff around to find the cocaine,and he eventually brings them down,but they later escape. Meanwhile a mailman named Gordon(played by Courtney Cox's ex husband David Arquette who looks an awful lot like Ryan Reynolds here back in 2001) is a dog hater who is cocky and not that pleasant to be around,that is until he has to mind his secret crush's (Lesily Bibb)son(played by Angus T Jones) as she has to go away for a while on some trip. But meanwhile when Agent 11 gets lost as a suspicious woman comes into the FBI working force field to take Agent 11 to Alaska,she switches the tags only for Agent 11 to somehow escape and later meet Gordon and the little boy. As Agent 11 spends some time with Gordon and the little boy,the little pooch has to decide who he wants to stay with and what he wants to do. Either to be a FBI agent dog who can't have some fun,or a household pet with Gordon and the little boy. You can smell the ending A MILE AWAY but still though what do I think of it.Well firstly I think the low rating is appalling I mean it could AT LEAST get a 7.5 out of 10 it was the same for another movie that got a 7.5 out of 10 and 90% in Rotten Tomatoes,See Spot Run got 23% in Rotten Tomatoes,clearly these people aren't kids at heart and they hate dogs like Gordon from the movie.But to be quite honest this film had me in stitches and i'll tell ya one scene that had me laughing so hard,THE PET STORE scene why?? because it was so silly yet hilarious at the same time as the owner of the store was too busy listening to her Walkman to see what is going on in the store as the 2 Mafia men that were after Agent 11(now known as Spot hence the title of the film as he has to run from the FBI and the mafia as he doesn't want to be caught up in a tangled web)were in the store and Gordon was blown up in this bubblegum wrapper with the squeaky voice.So yeah I really enjoyed this movie,is it the best film of all time NO,but do I like it YES I thought it was so hilarious and if you love dog movies then check it out.See Spot Run gets two thumbs up for me.

It's funny, there is no bad language or nudity and the story is well told. My yardstick for measuring a film is simple - was I entertained? 'See Spot Run' entertained me very much and I left the theatre still chuckling. 'SSR' is rated PG in the UK, which means it is suitable for children, but parents may wish to check for content they may consider inappropriate for their children first. The children who shared the theatre with me thoroughly enjoyed it judging by their laughter. It sounded as if most, if not all, of the adults were also laughing. It's a children's comedy - all you critics, don't take it so seriously. David Arquette does a very good job in the lead. The business with the dog doo was very well played and I enjoyed the way his manic behaviour calmed throughout the film until he was becoming almost normal at the end. If you have any doubts about going to see this having read the negative comments, just wait for the video, but you will miss out on the pleasure of sharing your laughter with an audience.

It ends up at Arquette's after a tag switch and a boy believing it to be his. This leads to a brainless climax where everyone makes a gallant effort to be a moron. Horrible directing by John Whitesell with predictable writing that will result in the dog choosing between owners. What the dog should be doing is choosing a better agent to represent him when it comes to these crap pad scripts. Arquette is terrible as a guy out to impress a female by watching her son thus leading to the idiocy someone labelled as a story. Duncan is unbearable in what is a shame considering his work in The Green Mile. Leslie Bibb is the standard love interest whose best scene has her plastered from head to toe with mud as a bus spins its tires. Anthony Anderson is featured as Arquette's roommate and he is unable to gain a single laugh. Angus T.

Basically crime fighting bullmastiff dog Agent 11 has been with the FBI in Seattle for a few years, trained by his master Agent Murdoch (Michael Clarke Duncan), and on one particular they are going after Mafia boss Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), who is taken to hospital after the dog rips off one of his testicles to be surgically replaced. Talia wants payback and tells his two bodyguards Gino (Joe Viterelli) and Arliss (Steve Schirripa) to kill the pooch while it is being transported for protection to an Alaskan training facility, but the dog escapes before they can catch him. Gordon Smith (David Arquette) who works as a mailman, and he like so many other mailmen hate dogs in the back or front yard as they are trying to deliver letters and packages, and he has volunteered for his neighbour Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) to look after her six year old son James (Two and a Half Men's Angus T. Jones). They meet Agent 11, and after a mistake involving a stuffed toy dog James thinks the real dog is for him, he is given the new name Spot, but being trained by the FBI he is not a regular dog, he has been taught since being a puppy not to play or be distracted, so no catching balls or frisbees. While Gino and Arliss continue to look for the dog, Gordon understands James is getting very close to Spot, but he is constantly being annoyed by his presence, as time goes by though they are becoming successful in making himself a regular playful dog. After an encounter with the bodyguards in a pet store, the FBI realise Agent 11 is missing, and eventually they locate him and Agent Murdoch arrives to take his dog back, but the dog escapes again, only to come against Talia again as he attempts to kill the dog himself, but he is outsmarted, caught and arrested. In the end the FBI still try to take their agent dog back, but Spot is given the choice to go back with them or stay with his new friends, he chooses Gordon and James, but he licks Murdoch goodbye, and Stephanie, who has gone through hell, returns upset, but James helps out, and they kiss each other. Also starring Scary Movie 3's Anthony Anderson as Benny and Kim Hawthorne as Cassavettes. Arquette is the sort of actor who would choose to be in a film like this, but he is pretty good actually, Bibb gets her own giggles, Jones is cute as the boy, and the dog of the picture is obviously a good character himself, I can see the resemblance combination to Turner & Hooch and Home Alone, the story is simple enough, it obviously has the silly and boring moments, but overall it is fun, a cheesy but acceptable family comedy.

The film is about a single guy who inherits a stray dog and a kid whose mother is just gorgeous but she goes away leaving her kid with a stranger (somebody call children services on this mother).

But Spot escapes and is adopted by a man (Arquette) who is watching a neighbor's (Bibb) son for a couple of days when the babysitter got sick. The antics that ensue involve too many scenes of destroying things, or people ending up in dog poo, and other such juvenile humor. The critic Ebert has a complete and accurate review. The DVD picture and sound are good, but the movie has little redeeming value. However, it does contain some of my favorite gangster types in Joe Viterelli and Paul Sorvino.

A review could have been an idea from a film I've just seen in theaters. It could be when I just finished watching a DVD. It could be I've wanted to review a certain movie for the longest time. Maybe my good buddy Nqnpipnr suggested a film to review or maybe he just finished one that I want to review too. But sometimes, a reason of me writing a review can get very weird. Anyone heard of the flash site done by Sam T called Ebola World? He's got crazy funny flash cartoons on his awesome characters like parodies against George Bush. In the last installation of his George Bush parody series, the phrase September 11 was strongly used and repeated. The stress of the word 11 brought me thinking Agent 11 from See Spot Run! Now I'm here. But also, just watching Ocean's Eleven brought me thinking of Agent 11. Just see how things work as they link to each other and the snowball effect in one's brain starts to unfold. Now to the review...See Spot Run is one fun-filled, dog comedies. Thank God it's not one of those CGI'ed animal films that are being chugged out of movie distributors these days. The film is hilarious from the antics of David Arquette and Anthony Anderson. One unknown actress named Leslie Bib stars as well. The film also consists of a cast of Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Schirripa, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Viterelli who died earlier last in January (God bless him).David Arquette plays Gordon, a gullible, hard-core, cool mailman. His best buddy, Benny is also a mailman and is played by Anthony Anderson, as it is one of his earlier but funny roles. Leslie Bib plays Stephanie, the neighbor of Gordon who he is attracted to. A young actor named Angus T. Jones plays James, the young son of hers. He does a good job as a young actor as he's done other small roles in Bringing Down the House, The Rookie, and plays in Two and a Half Men. The movie starts with a mob meeting of smuggling drugs as the feds are staking out as they covered the warehouse of the meeting with police and SWAT teams. The mob boss, Sonny Talia (Sorvino) is making the exchange when him and his mob are confronted when the feds move it. Murdoch (Duncan) comes in with his sidekick, a drug-detecting attack dog named Agent 11. They bust him and his mob for the drugs while Agent 11 rips out one of Sonny's balls out. Then when an assassination attempt occurs on Agent 11, Murdoch and the feds have to send him to an attack dog training facility in Alaska. The assassination attempt obviously comes from Sonny and his mob and he sends his two best men after him to kill the dog for revenge; Steve Schirripa and Joe Viterelli play them. They cause a car accident and the next thing we know, the dog is with Gordon and James during his babysitting time for Stephanie. Now the antics of dealing with the dog until James' mom comes back begin.Overall, See Spot Run is a great comedy and one of the last of it's kind seeing that studios just want to use CGI now instead of real animals. It's definitely a good comedy for all ages. It's just too hard to defend why the fans of it like the film, thus, it truly still is a guilty pleasure though even if people hate it. As those bashers say Don't See Spot Run. To them I say disregard.My Rating 8/10 (A Low 8)Eliason A.

Unfortunately for Warner Brother, the movie turns out to be even worse than you might anticipate. This predictable, disposable production is complete with  tons of desperate jokes dealing with dog poop, bad luck, inflated bubble wrap, fish tanks, clumsiness, an electrified dog collar, passing gas, and, or course, a canine sinking his incisors into a respectable man's private parts. See Spot Run proves to be painful for most adult audiences, and perhaps even a bit too amateurish for its target age group. This is just an all-around bad movie.The story contains a few funny scenes and a hysterical performance by Leslie Bibb, but everything else is a complete waste of time and money.The story opens with a powerful gangster named Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino) becoming a victim of the wrath of a canine cop's painful bite. He is caught during an FBI drug bust and holds a grudge against the authority's dog for biting off one of his family jewels. Talia orders an assassination on the dog, who is loved by the FBI's dog handler (Michael Clarke Duncan, the gentle giant from The Green Mile). When the police find out about the animal's life is in danger, they immediately rush him into a version of the witness protection program.The dog ends up in the hands of two bumbling nitwits, school-aged James (Angus T. Jones), and the much dumber Gordon (David Arquette). Gordon is baby-sitting James for a favor for his mother, Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), who finds herself out of town on business, but ends up in one amusing situation after another. Because Gordon has a conventional crush on Stephanie, he feels pressured into be a responsible individual for once. When the dog comes into contact with the targeted dog, his plan backfires and pandemonium ensue into one madhouse situation after another.See Spot Run is a classic example of how low American cinema thinks of children. The filmmakers must really think their audience is moronic for them to push a movie like this our way. Look at the recent trend of horrible family comedies. From The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,  to Snow Day to The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, Hollywood consistently demonstrates it sees little intelligence in today's young people.There was a time when kids would realize See Spot Run for the trash it truly is; the time when Beethoven felt inspiring and funny, or when Lassie felt fresh and inspiring. Now, the modern withdraw in pet movies come as dimwittedness, vulgarity, and at the expense of the movie's characters. Is it really all that entertaining going to the theater to watch a character step in doggie poo, getting his head stuck in a glass fishbowl, and become entangled in inflating plastic wrap? Come on. Those things belong in the Saturday morning cartoons. People only except them here because the production as a whole is so childish. The film tries to be a live action cartoon, and David Arquette does a good job as the animation.See Spot Run provides a few laughs, but at the same time we can feel our IQ dropping to the level of its imbecile characters.

The police send the dog to a protective service kennel in Alaska but unfortuntatly the dog is sent to a complete moron named Gordon.  He is deeply in love with his neighbor and his philosophy is that if he can get her son to like him, he can get her.  She runs into a babysitting problem and of course he is right there to help her out.  The kid finds the dog and automatically assumes that it is his.  It was about this point where you can guess the rest of the story because it is so predictable; at least I did.This movie assumes that everything from stepping in dog poop to getting electrocuted by an electric dog collar is funny and of course they underestimate the audience by a lot.  This movie is so terribly unfunny that it is painful to watch and more painful to listen to anyone laugh at. Yes, unfortunately a few people in the audience laughed and I still have no idea why.  The jokes were lame, the kid actor was annoying and David Arquette is his own usual character, the moron.The makers of this film assume too much of the audience and that is their first mistake of millions of others.  The direction is nowhere and the effects and props are so horrible that this film must have cost five dollars to make.

I think the studios would get better publicity and press by doing humanity work than releasing pieces of garbage like this.          There are so many things wrong with this movie.  The plot?  Simple, a dog who is the K-9 unit of the FBI caputres mob boss Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), causing Sonny to lose one of his testies.  Sonny misses his testie, so he has a hit man, Gino (Joe Viterelli) go out and kill the dog, animal rights activists where are you when we need you!!!

Hey, every house hold in America already has a piece of garbage in their houses, and the garbage man comes by weekly to pick it up.  Why would anyone want to take home garbage?        What ittitaes me first is seeing good actors like Michael Clarke Duncan, Anthony Andersen, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Viterelli in this film.  I don't know why the talented Andersen is doing bad movies, he's  very talented, he should be staring in films of his own.  Michael Clarke Duncan, well, he'll be forgiven since he's going to be in PLANET OF THE APES later this summer.  But Paul Sorvino and Joe Viterelli aren't so lucky.  They are casted, again, as mafia men, which is another example of Hollywood cast-typing.  How could Paul Sorvino eleven years later go from doing GOODFELLAS to this?  And how could Joe Viterelli go from doing ANALYZE THIS to...well, this? As for Mr. 1-800-CALL-ATT?  I have to agree with one of the writers of Entertainment Weekly, David Arquette should have his own one man version of SURVIVOR, and be left on that island alone forever.        And why, oh why does this film make more money that CHOCOLATE, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, WONDER BOYS, and ALMOST FAMOUS?!?!?!
