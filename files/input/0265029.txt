[{"Title":"Funny, likable, lightweight comedy","Date":"26 December 2001","Score":"36 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This is not a biting Hollywood satire, and I'm sure there were some missed opportunities to poke fun at the biz.  But as long as that's not what you're expecting, you should have lots of fun.I'm an avid Billy Crystal fan, and though he's not the star of the film, I was really looking forward to this movie--being that he also co-wrote the script.  There are some trademark zingers you'd anticipate from the Oscar's favorite MC  Sixty pounds?  That's a Backstreet Boy.The cast is superb.  Hank Azaria, like always, steals the show.  He is absolutely hilarious as Catherine Zeta-Jones' new Spanish lover.  There is a great scene near the end where he gets outraged at a rumor of his inadequate size.  Just like his role as the flamboyant butler in The Birdcage he brings out tons of laughs, taking on a phony accent.  He really is a man of extraordinary talent.  John Cusack shows us his more...goofy side.  I've always enjoyed him in past movies, but he usually plays the straight man. This was something different.  Well, I guess you can say he plays the straight man, but he stumbles into all sorts of slapstick situations that causes him to overreact in comic fashions.  And he's great at it!  Julia Roberts is...well...Julia Roberts.  I have nothing against Julia, but I don't patronize her in the same way others do.  I don't think she's the most beautiful woman and I don't think she's the most brilliant actress.  But I'm sure many were looking forward to this movie because of Julia, and if you're one of those people, you won't be disappointed.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is extremely beautiful, but she is so great as the whiny, bitchy ex-wife of Cusack/spoiled actress that I wanted to stab her every moment she was on screen.  Alan Arkin is funny as the pretentious, preposterous spiritual healer.  There is a great deleted scene with him and Cusack over the phone, while Arkin rides the streets of Vegas in a pink convertible.  Those renting the DVD--don't skip the deleted scenes!  And last but not least, Christopher Walken (Da Man!) has a brief but memorable appearance as reclusive director Hal Wideman.Don't expect any surprises.  The story's as predictable as can be.  The whole movie is superficial fluff.  But it's enjoyable superficial fluff. If you just want to kick back, have some good laughs, without having to kill any brain cells--curl up on the couch with your man or woman and watch America's Sweethearts.My score  7 (out of 10)          "},{"Title":"An entertaining look behind the scenes of the movie star romances.","Date":"4 August 2001","Score":"26 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Normally, who is married to/engaged to/dating who in the movie world is something that I couldn't possibly care less about, and I still don't care, but America's Sweethearts manages to make that very subject amusing and entertaining. John Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones play Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison, two movie stars who have been tremendously successful working together and who have worked their way into the heart of the American public. The conflict comes from their highly publicized breakup, which has resulted in two consecutive box office failures for Gwen and some serious psychological problems for Eddie.Stanley Tucci takes on a small but very effective role as Dave Kingman, the short tempered studio executive, furious with Christopher Walken's much more entertaining Hal Weidmann, the introverted filmmaker who sent Kingman the first print of his film (after charging $86 million of the studio's money), which consisted of nothing but titles and the hilarious message, `We could also do these in blue.' Kingman throws a predictable but very funny tantrum. We spend the rest of the film wondering why Weidmann is so cocky toward Kingman and so close-mouthed about the film, but we are rewarded in the final act. Julia Roberts comes back in an ironic role when compared to her recent (and far superior) role in Notting Hill, in which she was America's Sweetheart who had fallen in love with a regular guy. Here, she is the constantly unnoticed sister of Gwen Harrison, her big movie star sister. Both women are perfectly cast as the famous movie star and the famous movie star's sister, but this is more a testament to their abilities as actors than it is to the ingenuity of the casting director. The acting was just excellent. Hank Azaria plays the part of Hector (`This is bull-chit!'), the over-the-top Spanish guy with the hilarious lisp that Gwen has been seeing ever since her rough break up with Eddie. Hector is an amusing character, but it is obvious from the first scene where we see him (in which he insists that he and Gwen will `go to the &#145;hunket' together.') that he is an expendable character. He's funny, but he still badly mangled the Spanish accent as well as the lisp, coming off as amusing but impossible to take seriously.The entire romantic subplot of the film was predictable from the very beginning, if only because it was given away in its entirety in the theatrical trailer. If you have ever heard of this movie before watching it, then you've already seen the emotional scene where Kiki (Roberts) tells Eddie that that woman that he saw standing by the spa that he had to spend the rest of his life with was her, and not her sister Gwen. From that perspective, America's Sweethearts is one of those movies where if you've seen the preview, you've seen the movie (take Pleasantville as another example). Christopher Walken provides an excellent source of comic relief as well as one of the only really interesting characters in the film. He is the nutty filmmaker (indeed, the best films almost unwaveringly come from the people who are a little &#145;off') who edits his films in the Unabomber's cabin, which he had moved onto his property, and who indeed created a truly memorable film, of which we unfortunately are only able to see a small portion. `The Blair Bitch Project,' as the press later calls it, is a kind of film that would be really interesting. The tabloids would have a field day.There are a lot of sight gags and low brow humor in America's Sweethearts, and it is reported to bear a striking resemblance to Singin' In The Rain (although remains far inferior to that classic musical comedy), but it manages to keep the audience entertained if not hanging on every word. True film fanatics are sure to pick it apart for nearly feeding off of classic films and for following such a clear-cut formula, but there is definitely something to be enjoyed here.

Their latest movie is shortly due for release and their press agent Lee (Billy Crystal) with the help of Gwen's sister Kiki (Julie Roberts) have to get them back together and promote the movie.Written and produced by Billy Crystal 'America's Sweethearts' is a good giggle, and has some fine performances from Cusack, Crystal, Roberts and Jones (Although Catherine Zeta Jones's performance as a press hungry b*tch, is maybe a little too believable).

This film features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.There really isn't too much to say about this stinker, other than that although it has a couple of really good bits, most of it isn't very funny.  Nor does it work at all as a romance. How about as a romantic comedy? Not on your life.  Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated, much less amusing.What's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all.  This movie could have been so much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted, complete with phony quotes from critics.  The film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews.  But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes, it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance.The same with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character -- the whinny, self centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she's given, but she's given practically nothing.  It's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years.In the end, it is hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, which sinks like a rerun of The Love Boat. In fact, as the old joke goes, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So, go ahead and tell us, filmmakers, what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this?

This tangential storyline was written by Billy Crystal (also one the stars) and Lee Philips. The premise is very promising. America's Movie Sweethearts, Eddie Thomas (Cusack) and Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones), are no longer-- they are getting a divorce.In fact Gwen has a restraining order on Eddie following their dramatic break-up. Gwen is shacked up with a Spaniard dancer, Hector (an embarrassing loser role played by Hank Azaria). Eddie now resides in a spiritual retreat following his meltdown. However, Eddie and Gwen made one last movie with eccentric genius, reclusive director Hal Weidmann (perfectly played by Christopher Walken). No one has seen the film which looks to be a rip-off of Jean-Claude Van Damme's Time Cop. Weidmann professes this unseen movie is his greatest work. Studio Exec., Dave Kingman (Stanley Tucci), convinces promotions expert, Lee Philips (Crystal) whom he fired, to stay on and orchestrate the press junket for the movie. To bring the estranged Eddie and Gwen together, Lee enlists the aid of Kiki Harrison (Roberts) who is not only Gwen's doormat sister, but also her personal assistant. We soon learn that big hearted Kiki has always loved Eddie. The movie industry inside jokes and details surrounding press junkets are great in the beginning of the movie. Though this wastes time in what is predictably a romance. Tucci's ruthless and humorless exec. is way too dark a character for this movie. Hector (Azaria) is a total waste of time here. For the amount of talent involved in this project it is amazing how much useless overhead is in the movie. Don't get me wrong here entirely-- I did enjoy the movie. What saves the movie are the wonderful talents of John Cusack and his natural chemistry with Julia Roberts. Zeta-Jones is believable as the self-absorbed ice bitch, Gwen-- let's hope that she does not make a habit of these kinds of roles. Julia Roberts is not stretching here as the good hearted, smart, and plain sister of movie star, Gwen. Though Roberts unquestionably has the movie star quality-- she enchants on screen. Cusack is the quirky romantic leading man of the Milennium, and plays Eddie with a bewilderment and smarts. You always get a sense of what's swirling in Cusack's Eddie's head. He is aware of his emotional instability, while promoting a movie he has never seen, with a woman he is no longer with. And the woman of his life is right in front of his face-- Kiki. Duh! Cusack is totally charming in his journey from cluelessness. Ultimately, he and Roberts make Sweethearts worth watching-- which is saying quite a lot.

Sounds like a formula for a good movie, right?  Take real life movie stars that are loved by America and put them in a movie about hollywood-types and celebrities and call the movie 'America's Sweethearts.' Great idea, sure, until you go see the movie and realize that it is one of the most unoriginal, uninspired, idiotic scripts ever written.  The humor is at best predictable and cliche, at worst deliberate and insulting to my intelligence.  Even the funniest character, Christopher Walken's strange miser director, is a ball of over-used cliches about artsy film directors. I could swallow predictability and lame jokes if for one second I cared about one single freakin' character in the movie, but that would be too much to ask.  Julia Roberts' character used to be fat, but she's already gone through her transformation before the beginning of the movie, so there's no pain with which to sympathize.  John Cusack's character is supposed to be connecting to himself and you're supposed to be happy for him, but in flashbacks it seems like he was always pretty OK.  There is other stuff that really irritated me in this movie - one example is Catherine Zeta-Jones' Spaniard boyfriend, who is the dumbest melting pot of misplaced stereotypes of Puerto Ricans I've seen on screen in awhile and would've offended me if I thought for the one second that the writer (Billy Crystal...wasn't he funny when I was a little kid?) actually cared the slightest bit about his movie and his characters, but I know (pray) that couldn't be true.

Making fun out of the Hollywood dream couple, it thrives on superb performances by a well constructed cast. Catherine Zeta Jones in particular is great as the spoilt and self obsessed Gwen.The best thing about America's Sweethearts is the fun performance by Billy Crystal. Never to everyone's liking, Crystal has always been a master at wit and one off lines. in this film, like so many others, he comes out with some truly inspiring lines which hit the spot and make you laugh out loud.In fact, aside from the amazing performances, there's little else to be said about America's Sweethearts.

Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) is terribly jealous of Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones)'s relationship with the weird voiced Hector Gorgonzolas (Hank Azaria). Her last two movies without Eddie has bombed. Lee has to organize a movie junket without anybody seeing the movie. Meanwhile Gwen's dutiful sister Kiki (Julia Roberts) is slowly falling for Eddie.The script written by Billy Crystal, and Peter Tolan takes a few pokes at the movie business. It has a little fun. Billy Crystal is pushing hard for the material. Hank Azaria is doing another stupid voice and is all the more annoying for it. Cusack and Zeta-Jones have little chemistry or great rom-com chops. But there is one thing above all else that annoyed me the most. I cannot buy that Julia Roberts is the ugly duckling. They try to explain it away with her 60 lbs weight loss. Quite frankly, Julia and Catherine operate in the same area of acting. Julia may be slightly better, but this movie needs two women at the opposite ends. Julia can't really pull this off no matter how charming she is. Now if there is a fatter Julia Roberts with 60 lbs on her, she may be great for this role.

I love movies where a standard formula is put in TILT mode, and America's Sweethearts is off-center enough to make it more than a standard chick flick. The story starts with Lee Phillips, who has just been fired as the publicist for Kingman studios. The breakup of Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison, a movie star married couple, has put a dent in the studio's revenue. As he's cleaning out his desk, the head of the studio, Dave Kingman, calls Lee down to the screening room. It seems the director of Eddie and Gwen's final picture, the eccentric (to put it politely) Hal Weidmann, is holding the movie hostage, not letting anyone see it until the upcoming press junket promoting the film. Kingman begs Lee to put together the junket, and keep the press distracted by making it appear the Eddie and Gwen are getting back together again (Lee gets his job back if he's successful). Meanwhile, Eddie is still obsessed with Gwen, even though Gwen has moved onto this Spanish boy toy named Hector. Gwen has continued to make movies on her own, unsuccessfully (as we find out in an amusing scene with her on Larry King's show). Then there's Gwen's ever-suffering but loyal sister/personal assistant Kiki, who helps Lee convince Gwen to appear at the junket.All this is the setup for the aforementioned junket, which is where most of the movie takes place. Roger Ebert, who has been to a million of these things, didn't think the movie did enough to lampoon these kinds of press events, but to the average person who isn't part of the press, it did just fine in skewering the media culture. In fact, the movie does a good job making fun of the shallowness of the industry in general. Lee pulls one publicity stunt after another, usually at the expense of Eddie and Gwen. In one telling scene, after Lee releases some embarrassing information about Eddie to the press, Danny asks him, Don't you like Eddie? Lee says he loves Eddie, but, You're not here to love anybody. You're here to promote a movie. There's also the love triangle which develops between Eddie, Kiki, and Gwen. Even though Eddie's still obsessed with Gwen, he discovers he has feelings for her sister.What makes this movie really work are the performances, which are top notch all around. All the actors involved seem to be having a lot of fun with the material. Catherine Zeta-Jones always plays the shallow, cold-hearted biotch to perfection (as she also does in High Fidelity and Intolerable Cruelty), but her comic timing has never been better than here. John Cusack always does very well playing likable, off-center characters who are on the brink of insanity, and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. As Kiki, Julia Roberts shows off her comic timing as well, particularly with her facial expressions, which are subtle and effective. Stanley Tucci and Christopher Walken are both perfect in their roles as the psychotic studio chief and mad genius movie director, respectively. Ditto the brilliant Alan Arkin as the wellness guide at the holistic retreat where Eddie went after his breakup with Gwen and subsequent breakdown. And Billy Crystal shows once again that he's one of the finest comic actors of his generation (he also co wrote the story and screenplay). Rounding out the performances are Hank Azaria, who's a bit too over the top as the other guy Hector (the exaggerated lisp was a bit much), and Seth Green as Lee's eager assistant Danny.The end is somewhat predictable (boy ends up with the right girl after pining for the wrong one), but it's the clever and off-center way that the movie gets to that point (with some biting satire along the way) that makes America's Sweethearts several cuts above your basic romantic comedy. It's a chick flick that both of you can enjoy. 8.5 "},{"Title":"An OK romcom with moments of sheer brilliance","Date":"20 November 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" This is a weird film, almost as if it was written by 2 different people with very different approaches to comedy. At times it's fast paced, surreal & hilarious. At other times it's more situational, down-to-earth and amusing but not really laugh-out-loud funny. America's Sweethearts did indeed have 2 writers (Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan), but I'm only guessing that that's the reason. Regardless, it's a good film worth watching.America's Sweethearts begins with the fast-paced-hilarious, satirical approach which had me choking in laughter. The opening is reminiscent of the classic Hollywood Shuffle with its merciless mockery of the film industry. But it quickly simmers down to a more laid-back, easygoing romcom with a storyline. Periodically it hits us with some of the former hilarity but only in spurts.John Cusack delivers a great performance as the borderline psychotic yet lovable jilted lover. Catherine Zeta-Jones is his counterpart, perhaps not as mental but every bit as memorable. Billy Crystal plays his usual wisecracking self, no need to describe that any further. Julia Roberts is the voice of reason, or the straight man role.What ensues is somewhat predictable but packs enough surprises to keep you awake. Hank Azaria's portrayal of a Spanish gigolo is hilarious (if not slightly offensive to Spanish gigolos?) and that definitely keeps the momentum going. And then Christopher Walken makes a brief appearance or two, bringing down the house.This is a fun movie for everyone, but in particular, entertainment industry folks and film geeks will get a real kick out of certain parts. Like Hollywood Shuffle or the more recent lashing of Hollywood For Your Consideration, there are some funny inside jokes for movie buffs. But don't worry, if you watch it as a straightforward romcom it still delivers.

It also stars Keri Lynn Pratt, Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci, Seth Green, Alan Arkin, and Christopher Walken, and features a cameo appearance by Larry King as himself. It was written by Crystal and Peter Tolan; and it was directed by Joe Roth.Studio mogul Joe Roth returns to his roots as a director with this romantic comedy co-written by Billy Crystal and starring Roth's longtime friend Julia Roberts. Crystal stars as Lee, a studio publicist desperately trying to keep several facts secret from reporters during a high-profile motion picture's press junket. Among the developments that Lee is trying to obscure from view the film's eccentric director has essentially hijacked the $87 million movie and isn't allowing anyone to view it. Also, the film's high-profile, real-life married co-stars Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas have acrimoniously split since filming. Lee has led the press to believe that reconciliation is imminent, when in fact Gwen hates Eddie more than ever. Lee's secret weapon in his campaign of misinformation is Gwen's long-abused sister Kiki, who works as the pampered star's personal assistant while secretly pining for Eddie, who might just notice Kiki now that she's lost 60 pounds.Lacking originality or true wit, this mildly amusing but utterly banal comedy again demonstrates that Joe Roth is not much of a director and that Billy Crystal can do only one thing as an actor and that is just be Billy Crystal.Could have been more with such a great cast, but still manages to entertain.

Basically Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) were the golden couple of Hollywood, on and off screen, but they broke up, with Gwen falling for Latin actor Hector Gorgonzolas (Hank Azaria), and Eddie having temper tantrums. It is when their new film Time Over Time is being held by its director Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken), that PR wizard Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal, also writing), with some help from Gwen's assistant, and sister Kathleen Kiki Harrison (Julia Roberts), they need to get Gwen and Eddie in the same room together for a press showing that no-one will forget. Of course everything doesn't go smoothly for a little while, but the couple do reunite and try to get through it. In the end, the film Time Over Time is in fact a documentary with real love-hate material made with secret cameras, and it turns out Eddie has actually fallen for Gwen's sister Kiki, so at least it's got some sort of happy ending. Also starring Stanley Tucci as Dave Kingman, Alan Arkin as Wellness Guide, Seth Green as Danny Wax and Larry King. It is good to see satire made like a comedy, when it concerns the Hollywood lifestyle and behind-the-scenes stuff, it might not be the funniest and most witty film ever, but it is likable enough with the good stars and small romantic plot.

The acting is not real good overall, some of the characters (particularly Catherine Zeta-Jones') can be real annoying at times, and the plot was as predictable as they come. I could call just about every scene before it happened, and I was usually right. Nevertheless, the humor in the film (especially from Billy Crystal) saved the film from utter destruction. Even in a lesser film such as this one, Crystal can still make me laugh. For example, take one of my favorite quotes from this film (Rule #1 Always take credit for what you've done Rule #2, before you take credit, make sure the person actually likes what you did.) That's about as funny as the film gets, which is really not too bad. The wisecracks here and there and Hollywood-related jokes make up for some of the poorly-done romance scenes in the film. We honest are not really able to care enough about the characters to make this a good romantic comedy. The ending doesn't leave the audience with a sense of joy like films such as You've Got Mail and The Parent Trap do. However, since I laughed a few times, I'll admit it wasn't too bad. As far as a Julia Roberts film goes, it's inferior to My Best Friend's Wedding but slightly better than Runaway Bride. Not highly recommended, but it might make a good date film if you don't take it too seriously and set your expectations way low.**1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Effective Hollywood satire-romance","Date":"23 February 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" This film is really two films in one.

This film is a good example of one of those. Sadly, that's all it is. A promising start with some hilarious over the top trailers for past films that Gwen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie (John Cusack) made together before their very public breakup is let down by the rather unfortunate failure of Crystal in his script to capitalise on the potential for a great satire on Hollywood. Instead we just get the same thing we've seen over and over again in these types of movies the bloodthirsty studio executive (Stanley Tucci), the tiring foreign stereotype (Hank Azaria) and then the script's occasional resorts to crude, toilet humour.However, the film is saved by the brilliant performances of virtually everybody, including Julia Roberts as Kiki, Gwen's put-upon sister; a blink and you'll miss him Alan Arkin as a healing guru; and Christopher Walken who, though on screen for only five minutes, steals the film with his crazed film director genius, an obvious rip-off of someone like Altman or Bergman. The romance is cute, and the story, though slightly predictable, does still have a couple of intelligent twists that promise something much more meaty could have been achieved.

In this instance, Julia Roberts plays starlet Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones') down-to-earth assistant sister Katherine Harrison. It is unusual for Roberts to play second banana to anyone but in this case she does so, and more than ably. It is the everywoman element of Roberts which has made her such a dependable box-office boon for many years and in this film it pays off in spades as her character plays a good, decent woman who is perpetually overworked and under-appreciated by her self-involved, diva sister. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the ultimate in intolerable, high-maintenance movie stars who hardly even recognizes the existence of other people, let alone the degree to which she abuses them. The film centers around a press junket that Gwen must attend with another popular heartthrob, Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) during the making of the film. However, since that time, she has broken up with him and the two stars cannot fathom sharing jointly promoting the big tentpole Hollywood picture. However, the studio which funded the film depends greatly on the film and refuses to see its investment go up in smoke. So they engage super- fixer (Billy Crystal) to round up the two stars and arrange for a passable level of movie promotion. The fixer does his best but is thwarted at many different turns. Crystal wrote and produced the film. His script is sporadically funny. However, the nature of the film is really rather mysterious. Whether the unease of the main characters is supposed to be funny or whether we should be amused at the insignificance of the things that big movie stars argue about, or whether, perhaps, this is supposed to be an amalgam of those ideas is uncertain. It would seem that there is a very funny, sharp satire within this film, particularly if the dislike between Thomas and Harrison was ratcheted up. However, the characters do not seem to sufficiently dislike one another. Indeed, they seem too self- involved to really worry themselves with another person. Therefore the film somewhat stumbles through sporadically funny moments. The inclusion of the the romantic sub-plot between Thomas and Katherine Harrison also seems unnecessary. This is a nice film with some amusing moments, but overall, one wished for sharper jokes and more wicked satire. As it is, the satire seems half-hearted, which really leaves the audience wondering how seriously the film-makers intend to mock themselves.

The movie is a spoof on hollywood movie making but I don't feel it was ever intended to be anything more then it is. So many people have attacked this movie for playing it to safe and not being more of a dark satire. I, too, sometimes feel that way about movies that play it to safe when they could have broken new ground. But in this case, I disagree a bit with many. I don't think this was ever intended to take chances and go in radical new directions. I think it was just intended to be a cute perky spoofy movie. Period.I didn't see this when it first came out, saw it as a rental but was quite happy with it. There were many things I liked about it. One, the cast. It seems EVERYONE was in this. Unlike a movie like Ocean's eleven, though, where it was all dialogue driven, this was more focused on the characters themselves and their antics. And the characters seemed to exist as more caricatures then anything else. While I agree that certain parts of this movie were not always that funny, what WAS funny was watching all these stars hamming it up in larger then life, overblown roles and clearly loving every minute of it. I didn't get the feeling that this was SUPPOSED to be a dark satire.It was light, it was airy, it was a bit over the top and spoofy in a very clownish way-I think the movie did exactly what it set out to do.SPOILERS AHEADMaybe not entirely. The one thing I WAS disapointed in was the end.

No one is his right mind could care about the psychological travails (if any) of the Cusack and Roberts characters and the Zeta-Jones woman doesn't delve nearly deep enough into the dark soul of the manipulative prize cow. All semblance of tempo grinds to a halt every time these characters have a heart-felt conversation and the music isn't much help... On top of the truly revolting collection of candy-floss pop tunes on the soundtrack, composer Howard provides paint-by-numbers musical accompaniment to every single conversation that literally takes the viewer for an idiot the walk-down-the-garden-path flute theme for Zeta-Jones means she's being insincere, the violins for Roberts mean that she is pouring her heart out and so on. Dreadful!

And in a way, it is that, or at least has that element. Funny thing is, I was surprised to find another movie here as well -- nothing I expected at all Satire.  Not darkly funny satire as in Wag the Dog, but still there. I bet everyone knows the plot by now Vapid starlet's foundering career can be brought back by reuniting with her former husband and co-star, whom she left for a Spaniard, but the ex of course becomes attracted to her sister. The Spaniard is played by Hank Azaria who sort of reprises his role as the gay houseboy in The Birdcage, though this time as sort of heterosexual.The plot is complicated by Billy Crystal's sleazy publicist role -- who will do anything to get attention to the movie he's promoting, which of course stars those two (his monomania includes allowing himself to be molested by a Doberman Pinscher, the movie's least funny scene).  His scenes with maniacal producer Stanley Tucci are easily the best -- Tucci comes off as comically evil, with a serious anger management problem.  The fluffy stuff involves Jones and Roberts, the latter endlessly put upon by her needy, yet overbearing sister.  The satire component is reminiscent of S.O.B -- even down to the director stealing the movie he's directing, literally.  Stuck between these two elements is John Cusack, who's role is to play the husband in the depths of nervous breakdown -- yet who's sane enough to have some nice scenes, if saccharine, with Roberts.  He's got the best line in the movie (spoiler if you haven't seen it) -- when Crystal is trying to explain to him why Jones has far bigger accommodations at the hotel, he asks Well, she has an entourage ... you don't have an entourage. Cusack responds Im a paranoid schizophrenic, I'm my OWN entourage. The ending doesn't quite work -- great idea, the build up to it is reasonable, and the twist has great potential, but it sort of lets you down.  In the end, I was pleasantly surprised, I couldn't help but think it was a fusion of the aforementioned S.O.B and an old romantic comedy with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn called Holiday where Cary falls for the wrong (airheaded) sister.  Put them together, and you get a sort of version of this.  "},{"Title":"Just Bad","Date":"25 September 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  My Rating *1/2 out of ****. When I saw the trailer for America's Sweethearts it looked like it had some promise to it. I definitely could not ignore the star power. So, when it arrived in theaters I decided to check it out. When I came out I knew I had seen one of the worst films of 2001. To put it straight, I am not a big fan of romantic comedies but occasionally they do charm me. This was not one of them. America's Sweethearts has such a good cast that you would think there would be some good performances, but surprisingly the one who does the most credible job has the least amount of screentime. Many people think John Cusack is an underrated actor, however I have never been a big fan. Cusack has done some good work but he has never been in a film or given a performance that is outstanding to me. He is actually dull and uninteresting here. Julia Roberts tries hard to make her character interesting but never succeeds, she is very over the top in one scene. To my surprise, Billy Crystal was not funny in the slightest here. One of the only actors to be somewhat effective is Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is effective as a cold actress but doesn't share much chemistry with anyone. Hank Azaria delivers most of the comedy here but he is not in the movie for that long. Christopher Walken gives a brief but somewhat memorable role.America's Sweethearts is a very boring film, I kept thinking when the hell is this going to end.

Not that there were any illustrious costume designs or tricky visual effects, but the combined asking price of the four main stars, among others, must have been astronomical. Julia Roberts has the highest asking price in Hollywood at present, and John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Crystal, Christopher Walken and, er, Seth Green aren't exactly famed for having low prices. But when all are together on screen, the result is unsurprisingly good. Though what is surprising, is that none of them try to hog the screen or steal the show for what part they have.The script (co-written by Billy Crystal) is sharp and witty with the best jokes perfectly spread out. The overall effect is that of a likeable, enjoyable but not necessarily groundbreaking movie. While there is the occasional in-joke on Hollywood, this is too soft-centred and conventional to consider a satire. And it certainly isn't a film of `artistic depth' as the interpretation of Hollywood is skin-deep and shallow. But who cares about that? Especially when there are such talented leads on show.Roberts, Cusack and Zeta-Jones give deliciously bubbly turns in the love triangle of bitchery (the latter greatly sending up her `shallow' reputation) though it's questionable why Julia Roberts is playing the `deep' one. Crystal is as funny as he'll ever be, though this is hardly his best performance to date. Seth Green (`Austin Powers', `Can't Hardly Wait') is also humorous as the nerdy assistant, though could have done with more screen-time. And there are wittily eccentric turns from Alan Arkin and Christopher Walken. The former does a brilliant riff on `Scientology' (though it was done better in `Bowfinger') and the latter is excellent as the reclusive, meticulous director. The real standout is Hank Azaria as bumbling, lispy Hector who clearly has the funniest character.Joe Roth's directing is as average as one might suspect. But he gives the film an appropriately sour-spirited touch to avoid it being soppy and heart-warming. The narrative isn't bad either- blunt and to the point. Some scenes go on for a bit too long without laughter, but the closing moments are funny enough to make you forget about all that. The slapstick wit works perfectly well but the acerbic verbal wit is top-notch.While it certainly is a nice way to pass an hour and a half, with all the talent on board, this had the potential to be groundbreaking. I prefer to think of it as a nicely wrapped bundle of laughs, as opposed to a mediocre movie from a cast to die for. My advice is to go in with low expectations and you won't be dissapointed. My IMDb rating 6.9/10.

The script could have been much better, so I'm inclined to go with the latter.While the cast boasted some big names, there were a few key misfirings in that department.  The idea of John Cusack portraying a hollywood heartthrob is almost as laughable as Cusack himself *being* a heartthrob. Not to knock Cusack - he's a fine actor who has done plenty of great films. But heartthrob he ain't.Even more ludicrous than this call was casting Julia Roberts as the frumpy always-a-bridesmaid-type to Catherine Zeta Jones' big-screen babe. I'm sure Roberts loved the irony in the script - her playing a role that is so opposite what she has built a career doing - but the irony degenerates into total implausibility.  If ever there were cause for bona-fide frumpy always-a-bridesmaid-types everywhere to give up, this would be it.  A woman of Roberts' universal appeal just doesn't work in this role. Someone like Renee Zelweger would have fit the role much better.On the other hand, Zeta-Jones and Crystal were excellent choices. The film is good for a few laughs, particulary the subplot revolving around Cusack's nighttime excursion to take a peek at his estranged love.  As romantic comedies go, though, this one is remarkably average.  There's been such a resurgence in the genre at the box office in the last few years, and they are all starting to blend together.

The film is not entirely successful, with the good part not good enough to overcome the bad.The main story was much more interesting, with prissy stars, publicist pulling strings and manipulating the image of the actor/actresses in order to sell the film.  There are some poking fun at the industry, but it is more of a light jab instead of a stabbing.  So we end up with more of a `lifestyle of the rich and famous' type of movie instead of a sharp witty satire.The development of the romantic relationship is much less interesting and seem to be the main drag, breaking the pace for the whole film.  It would have been perfectly fine if this whole subplot was removed.Christopher Walken was interesting in the role of  the director of the film in which he refuses to release until the press showing.  But the surprise film, which consists of hidden camera footage during the filming of the movie, did not work for me at all.

Everyone in Hollywood is vain! That's the big revelation according to this muddled misfire of a really great idea from co-producer/co-writer Billy Crystal. He had something really meaty to bite into here - not things we already know like demanding movie stars and their all-important public profile, but the seamy world of the agents, publicists, studio execs and journalists who regulate their profiles. It's a world Crystal knows well; he's hosted enough Oscar ceremonies to understand the bitchiness behind the scenes. He adds a lot of inside jokes to the film, from the bag of goodies designed to entice journos to the junket to the circling studio execs who would let their biggest star suicide if it would boost the box office (as Stanley Tucci contemplates here). Yet Crystal's script, based largely on his experiences, is a real toothless tiger. Instead of going for the throat on the unethical goings-on of those behind the stars, it goes for standard laughs about the stars' glossy lifestyle and vain insecurities. Almost every scene ends in a one-liner, and the funniest one - when a doberman takes an interest in Crystal's crotch - is even repeated at the film's end. The result is as much a revealing look at Hollywood mechanics as a drive through Beverly Hills. It also proves that not even four heavyweight A-list actors can rescue a poorly scripted film. Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack, and Billy Crystal have absolutely no rapport, while world's number one star Julia Roberts (basically a bit player here) has less chemistry with Cusack than Crystal has with the doberman. There are some crackerjack jokes, like Crystal's You lost 60 pounds? That's a whole Backstreet Boy! and the way lisping Latino Hank Azaria keeps pronouncing junket as honket. But few of what's intended hits the mark. Zeta-Jones' demanding starlet isn't bitchy enough to be truly monstrous (didn't she see Bette Midler in Drowning Mona?) and Roberts' delectable underdog is a role way beneath her. It consists of smiling painfully and awaiting the inevitable. Mildly entertaining but instantly forgettable, America's Sweethearts is a talent-heavy misfire.

There was only one person I absolutely couldn't stand at times, and, that was Hector (Hank Azaria). This was because he didn't treat Eddie with very much respect. Plus, he called him a not-so-nice name. In my opinion, Lee (Billy Crystal) was an excellent press agent. As for Kiki (Julia Roberts), I thought she was a very beautiful woman. I just wish she would have scraped those glasses, though. The words that come to mind when I think of Hal (Christopher Walken) are diabolical and psychotic.

Was this film written with &#145;our' Nicole Kidman and &#145;Australia's former favourite son in law' Tom Cruise in mind? Film publicist Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) must get dream couple Eddie (John Cusack) and Gwen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) back together for one last performance as they try to sell a film to critics at a media junket. Problem is the film hasn't yet been produced by the director, setting in train a course of events that turns the show into a debacle as Lee grabs hold of every scrap of publicity he can. I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts but her performance in this film, as the sister/assistant of Gwen, made me actually like her. Cusack, as always, is understated, enjoying the opportunity to play yet another savvy and cool character with contradictory mental problems. Zeta Jones has a fine turn as a comedienne, while Crystal is also great as the time and movie &#145;poor' publicity consultant. Christopher Walken, Hank Azaria (although not as good as the others), Allan Alda and Seth Green make up an exceptionally talented supporting cast. No it doesn't break new ground and maybe not all of the jokes are funny, but it's gotta be better than most of the new comedies that we've been subjected to in the past year, remember The Animal?

But, at some parts, I cannot help thinking that the writers wrote his part with Jim Carrey in mind. But, in this case, John Cusack was a much better choice than Carrey. This film wouldn't be the same without Cusack. Seth Green, Stanley Tucci, Alan Alda, and Christopher Walken have smaller parts as Press Agents, reporters and movie directors. This film also gives a good insight to how the media corrupts the lives of some famous Hollywood stars. The media takes everything they see as how it appears.

Julia Roberts is feeble, Zeta-Jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), Crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and Cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.For what is supposed to be a 'Romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible SPOILERS)well, the only moments of mild humour came off the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever.

Pure genius.For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them, instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross-out, teen-movie' humour at times.A very poor 4/10.

Absolutely a PERFECT parody of Holywood, and I'm glad that there are enough people in Hollywood big enough to laugh at themselves.I view America's Sweethearts as Billy Crystal's film.  As the calculating PR man, he is the central character in a story about launching a new movie of questionable quality a with great publicity build-up, and he stops at nothing.  Yeah, Julia's in it and she plays her part well, but it's an ensemble cast with several great performances.All of the cast members play their parts to a T -- the publicity man, the artistic director who's still living in the 1960's, the spoiled selfish actress, her unstable ex-husband driven to an asylum by their sudden divorce, her Spanish actor boyfriend (check out his Castillian accent), the studio president with no ethics or conscience intent on making his movies into box-office smashes, the understudy publicist, and of course the starlet's sister who finally emerges as her own person.  And Larry King even makes an appearance.The title comes from Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusak as two formerly married stars who made many a box-office hit romance.  After Jones divorces Cusak for another actor, there is still one last movie in the can to be released.  And the Studio president schemes to make it as big of a hit as the others.Billy Crystal delivered a great performance as he stops at nothing to get publicity for this new release.  When leading man John Cusak tries to spy on his leading lady, ex-wife Catherine Zeta Jones in her hotel suite, he falls and is caught on a security camera hastily picking burrs from himself.  The film appears like he's doing something, um, auto-erotic and Billy Crystal buys it from the security guards on the guise that he wants to protect Cusak.  But somehow this film shows up on every newscast in the country.I especially liked the artsy, egomaniac director Hal Weidman as he holds the only copy of the film hostage not to be seen by anyone until he can present it to the full audience of the media.  He dramatically swoops down in a helicopter at the publicity weekend with his film in hand, stealing the scene.  The new movie itself turns out to be completely different than what the Studio intended, in fact different from just about anything you've ever seen.  I laughed so hard as they finally showed the beginning of the long-awaited new hit movie.America's Sweethearts is definitely worth seeing, not for its romance but as a great screwball comedy.

Then they broke up and the world no longer loved them or their movies.  Now comes the last movie that they made together and in order to sell it the studio needs them to be together again.  Bringing them together is the job of Billy Crystal and Julia Roberts.  Crystal is a studio publicist and he has to put together the junket that introduces the film to the critics.  What follows is great fun.  Actually it is very good parody.  And if you watch the movie and keep that thought it mind you are going to like the movie.  There are numerous scenes where you see the action first from the star's perspective and then from someone else's perspective and what they see and think is happening is totally different from what is truly the case.  Makes for some very good humor.  Unlike State and Main which goes into the actual making of a movie this deals just with a completed movie and presenting it to the critics.  Surrounding the movie you get a glimpse of what goes into previewing a movie for critics before its general release.  So you get a taste of the real world of movies and a good comedy.

It just looked like the next Romantic Comedy coming out of Hollywood. Sure, Julia Roberts is charming and John Cusack is a decent Comedic Actor. But theres something about Catherine Zeta thats just annoying. I have never seen her in a any role that didn't require here to be diabolical and cruel. Maybe its just typecasting. Maybe its good casting. Cast Aside though, This movie does do some things different, but not by much. Its part of the current hollywood trend of making movies that are about making movies. In this new genre theres the good (Cecil B. Demented, State and Main), The bad (The Muse, witch is actually about screenwriting) and the Ugly (You know who you are). America's Sweethearts falls somewhere in between good and bad. These movies seem to be outlets for big stars to lament over the difficulties of being an actor (witch actually makes them sort of escapist fantasy) and most of the time it doesn't work. Because, like this movie tries to say - who cares? Doesn't anyone have their own life anymore? Why focus on celebrities. Theres a couple good scenes, like the ones with C.W. But for the most part the comedic sketches don't work, leaving the movie to be saved by its romantic half, witch it does fairly well. What happened to Billy Crystal? I understand he co-wrote it, but he didn't write himself one good line. Because one of its only comedic devices is the fact that zetas new spanish boyfriend (hank azaria) can't pronounce english correctly, I can't recommend this movie.

There are several problems with his predominance in the film, however although he does have a conflict to be resolved, as a main character should, the first part (getting Eddie and Gwen to seem reconciled) blows up in his face yet is somehow supposed to be successful work, and the second part, getting his job back, we never find out about.  In the meantime, all these luscious actors are lampooning themselves mightily and having a great time doing so.  Who would have guessed that Zeta-Jones could do comedy so well?  That Julia Roberts would have such insight into the self-effacing characters she sometimes plays?  I wanted to spend more time with the actors and less with the publicist.  Many of the reviews I read suggested that casting John Cusack was a mistake, because he wasn't believable as a Hollywood leading man--but sure he was, after seeing the retrospective of his film career at the start of the movie.  THOSE movies, he could star in.  We're not talking Cruise and Kidman here (although we may be hinting at them), we're talking, say, Tom Selleck and Meg Ryan.Although the movie did not seem balanced in quite the right way--Roberts gets top billing for what is really a supporting part--the one-liners made me laugh, the physical humor by Roberts, Cusack, and Azaria was great visually, and Walken's costume/make-up were perhaps the best joke of all.  Even the over-exposed Crystal had a script that works well with his comic rhythyms.  The movie is silly and fun--it only needed to get Roberts and Crystal in the right balance.

I think that it purposely uses the witty, yet backstabbing, unromantic Jew (Billy Chrystal) and the comic relief super-sexy yet stupid latino with a thick accent (the spaniard, referred to by Julia Roberts as Ricky Ricardo), the fat girl who becomes empowered and earns love when she gets skinny.  It's a movie about screwing the producers and holding a film hostage, telling them that it is one film when really it's another.  Christoper Walken plays the director in the movie, holding his own film hostage, but when he finally shows it, he explains that the dialogue was pure crap and his film is taken from hidden cameras on the set of this external movie.

If you like it, are you being sycophantic? If you don't, are you refusing to get the joke? America's Sweethearts - fairly relevant considering the recent legal actions in America - is based around one such press junket, for the latest film of the eponymous America's sweethearts, the adorable Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison, played by John Cusack and Catherine Zeta Jones. But there's a problem - Gwen has left Eddie, for a fling with a Spanish smoothie (Hank Azaria). So, the studio employs the services of media fixer-uppers Billy Crystal and Seth Green to get them back together for the junket weekend. They in turn enlist the help of Gwen's sister and assistant Kiki (Julia Roberts), who, it just so happens, is in love with Eddie herself. There's nothing really to dislike about America's Sweethearts. Just from the synopsis above, you don't need a degree in literature to work out how a fluffy romantic comedy such as this is going to turn out. Cusack puts in a reliable turn as the sensitive and dependable Eddie, while Zeta Jones is rather entertaining hamming it up as a self-obsessed drama queen. Other cast members also make the most of their roles, even if Azaria's funniest moment is pronouncing junket as 'honket'. Building on his Oscar presentation triumphs, Billy Crystal co-scripted the film, and coincidentally gets all the best lines. But there just aren't enough of them. While the first third is a rather good satire on Hollywood played by a good ensemble cast, Joe Roth's direction is pretty much by-the-numbers and by the end of the film there isn't nearly enough to distract from the standard trundling rom-com conclusion. A very hard film to dislike - but you can't help thinking that with a bit of work on the script, it could have been so much better.

The trailer really worked for this film. I remember when I saw it, I thought it looked sooo funny, but the movie only made me crack a smile and a laugh here and there.The performances were kind of disappointing also. There really was no stand out performance in this film, except for maybe Julia Roberts, as usual. I really did not like Hank Azaria in this film. He does many very funny voices for The Simpsons, where he does accents and different voices and all, but his Spanish accent in this film sucked and only annoyed me. Catherine Zeta-Jones was annoying also. When she first became famous with The Mask of Zorro, The Haunting and Entrapment back in '98 & '99, I did not like her acting, she, well, sucked. She did, however, prove herself as a worthy actress with Traffic and I even thought she was robbed of at least an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. And here she comes with America's Sweethearts and loses more points on her acting credit in my book. I guess because I thought her bossy, bitchy, self absorbed character was annoying.  So I really don't know what to think of her acting abilities as a whole.I'm a HUGE Julia Roberts fan so I mainly saw it for her because man is she a cutie and a great actress, I don't care what anyone says, she's a very good actress. And she didn't disappoint me. She looked cute throughout the whole movie and I liked her character, she did a really good job. I love her goofiness in these kinds of films and her body movements and just the overall way in which she presents herself I find to be very entertaining, because they are at least somewhat funny. I also like when she's angry and yells. I don't know why, but she yells good, especially the scene where she told John Cusack's character that it was her by the pool and not Gwen. And whenever she smiled, I caught myself smiling. You just can't help it. She's got a great smile. Billy Crystal was funny and the scene with him and the dog was one of the standout scenes in this flick. It's silly, but funny.I guess I've said a lot of negative and positive things about this movie, but it was okay, worth a 6/10 because overall, I enjoyed it. It was entertaining and moved along at a quick 100 minute runtime because a lot of comedies and just movies overall these days are unnecessarily over 2 hours.

Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack and Billy Crystal in one movie? Seems like a clash of personalities. Billy Crystal comes out clearly on top and it is obvious he is most comfortable in this type of movie-making. He delivers it with compunctual ease, slipping from 'When Harry Met Sally' to 'City Slickers' with no apparent join. Zeta-Jones seems to struggle the most, and never really casts a shadow on the erstwhile Roberts. Hank Azaria plays the Spaniard and Christopher Walken shows up to play a Director with an artists' eye. He is also clearly quite bonkers to boot.

Add to this Julia Roberts as the cinderella to Zeta Jones' ugly sister, and it seems difficult to imagine where it could go wrong. Well, the cracks begin to show with a cameo from the usually excellent Alan Arkin which just isn't funny. Roberts appears to be merely going through the motions, using all of her trademark moves (the whimsical smile, the Roberts rant where she shouts at someone for 5 minutes without letting them get a word in, the bit where she suddenly appears looking radiant leaving everybody to wonder why they never noticed how beautiful she was before). Cusack never really convinces us that he's fallen for Roberts, leaving the romantic plotline unsatisfied at the end. And Walken isn't given nearly enough screen time. The film is saved by hilarious performances from Hank Azaria, who isn't inbited to the hunket, Stanley Tucci as the stereotypical producer who sees dollar signs in his star's suicidal condition, and Crystal in the central role whose performance holds the whole thing together.  6/10 "},{"Title":"Hollywood Pokes Fun at itself","Date":"22 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  In `America's Sweethearts', the story of two superstars who broke up and the people around them plays out while we witness many of  Hollwood's foibles in the background.

After eighteen months separation, the pair are forced to promote their final film together at a press junket in the Nevada desert.A much less glamourous Roberts plays Kiki Harrison, the long-suffering publicist and sister of Harrison ( Zeta-Jones ). Crystal assumes the role of Lee Phillips, the double dealing but consistently likeable media whore that handles Thomas's publicity.A word on the cast then.  Cusack is superb.  His neurotic portrayal of a man emerging from emotional wreckage is both amusing and inspiring, leaving the viewer with the sure and certain knowledge that this kid's gonna make it. His interplay with Crystal's character is excellent too, being very stop-start in its delivery.  Cusack becomes more charismatic as the films rolls on, and makes a great leading man.Zeta-Jones plays the Hollywood prima donna with great effect.  She doesn't play a likeable character, but regardless of whether the audience like her, she undoubtedly commands a modicum of respect.Billy Crystal pulls off perhaps the performance of the film, portraying someone who wants the film to succeed at almost any cost (including the reputations of its protagonists ), but at the same time shows remarkable fondness for his Hollywood charges.Julia Roberts shines as her role, showing a great deal of vulnerability and inner strength as Kiki.  Her relationship with the other characters seems genuine and heartfelt, and once again, she had me falling in love with another of her characters.  Amazingly, she does actually do dowdy for much of the film, which given her natural attributes, is quite remarkable.  She always manages to come second best in exterior beauty to Zeta-Jones, something both her and the rest of the crew should feel proud of.Seth Green puts in a good supporting performance as Phillip's green apprentice, and a lot of the humour involves Crystal's character slowly eroding Green's ethics.  Christopher Walken also makes an appearance as Hal Weidmann, the maverick film director who's taken total responsibility for the editing.  Special mention should also go to Hank Azaria, who plays Harrison's Spanish love bunny Hector - who provides a ridiculously comic Iberian accent throughout whilst personifying south European machismo. Finally, Stanley Tucci plays the desperate, ruthless studio boss who'd happily see his stars commit suicide if it made the film a hit.Much will probably be made of the supposed parallels between this movie and the real life breakup of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, simply for timing reasons.  Forget about all of that - this movie is a charming, cynical comedy that deserves to succeed on its own merits.  The parallels aren't nearly as pronounced as those in Primary Colors; in fact the only real parallel is that two very famous people are breaking up.Go and see this movie.  It's funny, intelligent and most importantly, you'll leave the cinema feeling like you've just met that special someone.  Now for a romantic comedy, that really covers the bases!

So, naturally, I don't keep away from it. You know, the more the warning, the more the want to do or see something. So, what did I think of this movie? Well, gosh darn it, it certainly surprised me. I was expecting a piece of crap, but I actually really liked this movie. It was charming, funny, romantic, good-hearted and original. There were some stand-out scenes (eg Billy Crystal and the dog, Julia Roberts dumping fried eggs over John Cusack, the very funny beginning) and some not-so-good ones (John Cusack on the roof, Christopher Walken's stupid character) but all in all, I liked this movies ideas and it kept me entertained. The all-star cast is pretty impressive. Julia Roberts continues to reign as one of Hollywood's favourite leading ladies, Catherine Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Seth Green gives a cute shaved-head performance as Billy Crystal's secretary. However, the one downside about the acting was John Cusack. I usually love his performances, but he really just didn't fit this character. Both Cusack's acting and the character were very annoying at times. However, thankfully Billy Crystal, who gives the best performance in the entire film, saves this. He is funny, warm and delightful actor and is by far the most convincing out of the entire cast in the movie. Not only does he play the leading man excellently, but he also produces the movie well and writes a funny, original and adorable script. Kudos, Billy, you really are a crystal. So, at the end of the day, this movie is one for people who expect a good time out of an original romantic comedy. It's not for those who go in predicting brilliance or excellence in absolutely all areas. So, go in and just expect to have a good, cosy time and I'm sure and I hope you'll enjoy America's Sweethearts.

The problem arises when they have to promote a final movie together and try to give the impression that there might be a chance of them getting back together.Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack play Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas, the film star couple, Julia Roberts is Gwen's assistant and sister, Kiki, and Billy Crystal is the movie publicist, Lee. A special mention goes to Hank Azaria for playing Gwen's Spanish lover, Hector. They all do a brilliant job of their characters, particularly Hank Azaria and Catherine Zeta-Jones, although Julia Roberts is once again that woman-with-a-retaliatory-speech-that-she-has-to-make-in-order-to-be-understo od that we are getting to see too much of in her recent movies.&#145;America's Sweethearts' represents movie stars as people with two lives to live &#150; their own and their persona's. The two are definitely separate entities, and problems (e.g. gossip) arise when the line between the two are blurred. In the case of Gwen and Eddie, their professional lives are endangered by the fact that the fans' perception of their personal lives reflect their professional lives &#150; as a couple who will live together happily ever after. In this sense, stars are not the actors themselves, but how they are perceived by fans in relation to their personal lives &#150; products to be consumed by the consumer. However, in order to become a star, the actor must first prove himself or herself in a successful movie or TV program. For example, as well as being Gwen's lover, Hector co-stars with her in a previous movie, but he is not a star because he doesn't seem to have the talent to &#145;make it big' and to create a persona for himself.Gwen and Eddie are portrayed as pampered stars who can command people to get them what they want. In particular Gwen is more of a spoiled brat, and (apart from being a star) this is what differentiates her from Kiki. However, what comes across is that Gwen is unattractive (personality-wise) simply because she is a star. In this way, the movie portrays stars as human beings with feelings but also as obnoxious, horrible people (mostly for comic relief).As a movie, I felt that the narrative was tired, although the setting was interesting. Ironically, had it not been for the stars featured in the movie, I might not have been interested in this film. As an audience member, I put together a few clues from the personas of the stars (Julia Roberts' string of successful &#145;chick flicks', Billy Crystal's consistent comedic roles, etc.) and formed high expectations. I left the movie theatre slightly more than content &#150; another movie diagnosed with star-itis.

Kiki and Eddie were adorable together, however they should have had more scenes rather than it just being about Gwen. Catherine Zeta-Jones did a great job as Gwen, very believable as heartless but her acting isn't something that I would call remarkable.

If you have that expectation you probably have not been paying attention to Billy Crystal's style of humor. He has been in more clever comedic films (most notably When Harry Met Sally). But that was the product of a brilliant director and screenplay. Same with Harold Ramis' direction in Analyze This. Not that Billy is not very funny you just have to have a slightly different expectation. Anyway, on to my likes/dislikes. I will get the negative comments out of the way first. One of my pet peeves is the tendency for films about making films to do this crazy way over the top depiction of their industry. The super cornball movie titles and trailers have become so cliche it makes me a little nuts. The other recent examples that come to mind are State and Main and Notting Hill. The only good reason for this that I can think of is to purposely distance themselves from the reality of the business so as not to step on toes. Perhaps they think if they make it obviously a fantasy, industry insiders can not possibly be offended if they cross over into reality a bit. That is my main complaint about this film and it gets particularly over the top at the end with the nutty director having flipped out and exposing everyone with his behind-the-scenes footage. I really could not quite buy into that whole premise, especially with his home movie style shooting. That plus a few moments of very juvenile sexual humor were disappointing in relationship to the rest of the story.Now for the flip side. John Cusack is fantastic. I have always liked his acting, although in the past he has not had the best of roles. Other than Being John Malkovitch this is my favorite performance from him to date. Julia Roberts was also quite good as she is in just about everything she does. Catherine Zeta-Jones also gave one of her finest performances and displayed remarkable comedic timing. Billy Crystal was also very funny and, as always, has a great screen presence. These days it seems like ninety percent of the comedies that come along are geared for the teenage crowd, so it was nice to see something with a little more mature sense of humor. I definitely would not consider this a sophisticated comedy. However, it gave me quite a few good laughs and was reasonably entertaining.

In recent months, Hollywood breakups have been the center of attention; most notably Tom and Nicole. In one of this summer's most anticipated comedies, &#145;America's Sweethearts' takes us inside a veritable Hollywood break-up set against the backdrop of the most important element in a film's promotion &#150; the press junket.      This is where reviewers gather together to screen a film before its' initial release, and then get to interview the actors as they numblessly sit through countless, pointless interviews repeating the same answers to the same questions over and over. If the previous sentence was long and tiring, then you get the idea of a press junket from the actor's perspective. If you have ever seen a television interview with the actors from a film always in the same room with different interviewers then you have been inside a press junket. The film makes a poignant point of emphasizing that these junkets are specifically tailored for the reporter and not for the film.     Billy Crystal plays Lee; a junket publicist who makes sure to please the reporters in order to get great reviews for the film. He is in charge of putting together this junket, yet there is only one minor detail. The film's two stars Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas (Respectively played by Catherine Zeta Jones and the excellent John Cusack) are not at an &#145;item' anymore. In order to aid their failing acting careers they must pretend they are an item once more in order for their fans to return to their films after a string of disasters. One would think that hilarity would ensue at this junket once these two actors forge their way back into the hearts of Americans; hence the title. Yet, this is not the case.       Director Joe Roth (longtime Disney films producer) manages to keep the story written by Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan light; but unfortunately so are the laughs. Furthermore, Julia Roberts portrays Gwen's sister/assistant who seems to cater to her sister's every need and thus suffers one of the film's greatest weaknesses. Roberts' character seems to take a back seat to the events surrounding Zeta Jones' and Cusack's &#145;fake' reconciliation efforts. Even though Roberts gets top billing, her character does not.     The film spans itself over a period of 72 hours thus covering the junket and the ensued relationships that form themselves over this period of time. Yet, the film never takes full advantage of all the &#145;Hollywood-ized' political hoopla that often occurs at junkets. Instead the film seems to shift back and forth between the relationships between the actors and the chaos of the junket.       Christopher Walken, Seth Green, Stanley Tucci and the incredibly talented yet underused Hank Azaria (who seems to be one of the better things in this film as he plays a trash talking Spaniard) all bring in strong performances to an otherwise disappointing and slow romantic comedy that seems to awkwardly hit a lot of dead ends. It really is too bad considering the amount of talent invested in this surprisingly well made but pointless film. Simply by watching the previews we know that Roberts' and John Cusacks's character will have some sort of romantic quarry during the film leading to no great surprises.       I simply have one question. Could it be that perhaps the world is tired of seeing Roberts as the girl next door who is simply perfect and that we should all feel sorry for? Besides her role in the fantastic &#145;Notting Hill', ever since her comeback she always seems to play the perfect woman. This feeling was endured while watching this film, there is nothing new or fresh. Even though &#145;America's Sweethearts' offers some funny moments, it leaves the viewer with bad after taste. Resulting from a film that could have gone in two other totally different directions probably resulting in a much better film. The finished product wants to satirize the press junket while delivering a cuddly, romantic story that unfortunately will not come across as a very sweet film.

This may well prove to be more than I thought it would be; for satire is the greatest of all comedies. Yet sadly, the movie failed to transcend the satired, stereotypical, ordinary, mainstream movie. It should be subject to its own criticism. After all, if the beginning statement is indeed taken to be satiric, i.e.,all Hollywood romantic comedies follow a specific, simplistic path, and can be easily replicated in a brief sample shot, then why does the movie itself take this overly-trodden-upon path?Eddie, we are told, is in love with the conceited, cold, and calculating Gwen. After her infidelity, Eddie is so distraught that he has a mental break down, and both attempts and fantasizes murderous revenge. These serve as poignant reminders that although the Eddie/Gwen love did not develop on screen, it was indeed a powerful love. Soon, Eddie and Gwen are conveniently placed in close proximity and just as they near reunion, Eddie realizes that it is the quiet and comforting Kiki that he had loved all along. To remain consistent, the Eddie/Kiki love is as immediate and underdeveloped as the Eddie/Gwen love. The audience can't help but feel that it is more fickleness than attraction that draws Eddie to Kiki. Not only do the nice and desperately pitied characters unite in the end, but the evil Gwen receives her just deserts and is thoroughly humiliated in front of the international press. The idiocy of her adulterous beau is revealed to boot.   Have you ever seen the episode of the Simpsons where Homer gets a crayon dislodged from his brain and suddenly becomes a near genius? He goes into a movie theater and is bewildered by the zealous laughter over childish antics, catch phrases, and plot structure.

Like Tracy and Hepburn, Gwen Harrison (Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (Cusack) have made a string of successful movies that have made them the number-one cinematic couple in America.  And the fact that they're married in real life hasn't hurt their image, either.  But then something happened-- and his name is Hector (Hank Azaria), a Spaniard who waltzed into their lives and turned Gwen's head, much to the chagrin of Eddie and the ticket-buying public.	Jump ahead a year-and-a-half.  Gwen and Hector are together, and Eddie is languishing away at a `wellness' resort under the care of an holistic health maven (Alan Arkin).  In the meantime, the final Gwen and Eddie film is still in post-production in the hands of auteur director Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken) who has promised producer Dave Kingman (Stanley Tucci) that the final cut will be ready in time for the publicity junket.  Kingman is relying heavily on this film, because Gwen's last two solo efforts have tanked.  Apparently the public just doesn't want to see Gwen without Eddie-- they want them back together, which means Kingman wants them back together.  And he wants them back together now.  Or at least in time for the junket.  So the job falls to publicist Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal); get Gwen and Eddie back together, or else.  The problem is, they haven't even seen each other in a year-and-a-half, and their parting wasn't exactly amicable.	Working from a clever, funny screenplay (By Crystal and Peter Tolan), Roth keeps the story moving right along and on track.  His presentation is fairly straightforward, and it works well for this film which is primarily character driven with a lot of heart at it's core.  The pacing and timing couldn't be better, and the cast is terrific.  The performances, in fact, are really what makes this one fly; just like Gwen and Eddie, it's the people who are the real story here.  	Julia Roberts plays the less-than-glamorous Kiki Harrison, Gwen's sister and assistant who caters to Gwen's every whim and want, while carrying a secret torch for Eddie.  It's the kind of role for which Roberts is well suited, the down-to-earth girl who is what she is, and it brings out the best in her as an actor.  Even looking slightly disheveled, there is something alluring about her; she has that charismatic screen presence and a natural twinkle in her eye that just seems to work so well for whatever character she's playing, and with Kiki it all works perfectly.	Catherine Zeta-Jones, meanwhile, takes the glamour route as befits the character, and she is what Gwen must be  Absolutely gorgeous.  And it's a great performance, as she offers a real look behind the glamorous facade to show what a shallow person Gwen really is.  Not that she's a bad sort, but just rather self-absorbed, and Zeta-Jones plays it with relish.  Unlike Gwen, she isn't afraid of presenting a very real person to the world, even though it gives a slightly skewed perspective of the `Movie Star' persona.  She's believable, and it's easy to accept that she and Roberts are sisters, which of course gives credibility to the story and makes the humor and the romantic angles even more solid.	John Cusack delivers, as well, making Eddie something of a regular guy and someone to whom it is easy to relate.  Beyond the Hollywood star that he is, Eddie is just Eddie, and Cusack makes him accessible and a character that is easy to like.	And Billy Crystal has found his perfect role as Lee, the publicist.  This is just the way you imagine a person in his position would be, and you get the sense that Crystal in drawing upon some personal experience in bringing this character to the screen, making him real, but presenting perhaps a softer version of the real thing.  But then again, this is a comedy, and he makes Lee what he should be, funny and likable.  And he IS one funny guy.  And nobody, but nobody, could react to the advances of a big dog like Crystal.	With the likes of `Mystery Men,' `The Birdcage' and now this one, Hank Azaria is seemingly trying to make a career out of doing characters with bad accents.  Hector's accent comes across like a kind of convoluted version of Pacino's Tony Montana in `Scarface.'  It's hilarious, and it really makes the character.	Also included in the supporting cast are Seth Green (Danny), Scot Zeller (Davis), Larry King (Himself) and Steve Pink (Limo Driver).  It may be fiction, but it's still fun to get a look behind the curtain to see these characters as they really are, and beyond that, `American's Sweethearts' is what it promises to be  Romantic and funny.  It gives you some characters who are a kick to be around for awhile, a couple to root for and just an all around good time for just under two hours in the dark, from which you emerge with a smile on your face and a good feeling inside.  That's definitely not a bad deal, and that's why it's called the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

Boy looks are sure deceiving. Now don't get me wrong it was a good movie but, it wasn't a great movie like it could have been. The cast was good because Catherine and John have been in another movie (High Fidelity) where they played a couple and yes it was believable. Julia of course played her cute, normal self. But, I really think that this was not her best movie. Pretty Woman, Dying Young, Sleeping with the Enemy, Mystic Pizza, and Steel Magnolias are a few of her best movies. John Cusackis a good actor who would rather do silly romantics or pure comedy. All his movies in the eighties to the nineties were very good even 2000 was good. But, 2001 for John has another sure to be a good movie called Serendipity with the girl from Pearl Harbor- Kate Beckinsale. This was definitely not his best work. As for Catherine it was good to see her play a lessdramatic character for once, because every now and then you need a break.Now for Billy Crystal, he co-wrote this movie and yes some parts were funny, but a lot of it wasn't. What was the deal with that clinic that was not funny, and Hank Azaria's character got boring fast. It was a good movie but, it needed a better ending with Eddie and Kiki and Kiki should have told her sister Gwen off. That is what I think should have happened, and it could use a little rewriting here and there.

The cast, John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, reads like a director's dream list. I love John Cusack. I have since the teenage years. He's super swell on the retina and simply charming. Catherine Zeta Jones is a very talented and beautiful actor. She's proven herself in more than a few good roles, and stood-up to the less-than-flattering press for her personal choice in spawning partners. Julia Roberts has that certain light within her that could keep a small fishing village lit through a storm of many days&#133;. BUT, I still hated this colossal erroneously cast hack-fest-extravaganza.It's not that any actor involved was bad. Contrary, they were consummate professionals uttering the doggie doo-doo script they were given as best they could. It's not that the film was telegraphically predictable, which it was, that made it so unbearable. It was just its relentless corniness and goofy music piping in all around in Dolbly accenting the kucka that made one squirm with each frame. Don't get me wrong it's a comedy, you don't look for Schindler's List depth - if you know what I mean. Even park- your-brain- at- the- concession- stand comedies are bearable, enjoyable even charming--when they work. You're there to laugh, giggle, dare I say have a few Guffaws! Not here. American Sweethearts has no such comedic charm, and left the laughter for part two I guess.Poor Bill Crystal reduced himself (as he co-wrote this) to spewing Yiddish jargon for laughs. And you always know you're in trouble comically when they bring out the testicle jokes (Farrelly Bros. Films being the solitary exception to the God-deemed rule).The veneer they call a story revolves around America's movie sweethearts, Eddie (John still talented-even if I sometimes pick Stilton cheesy scripts Cusack) and Gwen (Catherine I just had to get out of the house&#133;that baby cries all the time Zeta Jones).They are actors responsible for Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks-esque fluffy romantic fare the public can't get enough of. They are also, married off screen, though not happily. Their marriage is on the rocks; big old New England coastal rocks. Gwen had an affair, which lead to a separation, which lead to Eddie's breakdown. She's living with a Spaniard named Hector (Hank Azaria). And the token Spanish jokes are flying.Gwen and Eddie are still the world's most romantic couple-in the public's eyes. Though, the reality is quite different. Eddie's distraught, a year and a half later, over the celestial break-up and is knee deep in herbal healing tonics and found repeating silly daily inspirations stashed away in a Hollywood style wellness center, while Gwen enjoys long hot days fiddling with her new man kebab while sipping on fame's cool elixir. Her last two movies failed and she's getting nervous about her star's shine though.The two have a last movie in post-preduction, Time Over Time, that could resurrect her career, and after all, promotion of the film regardless of their personal dysfunctional differences, must go on.So the sneaky manipulative studio head (Stanley way too good to slum like this Tucci) gets Lee (Billy Crystal) a sneaky manipulative PR guy from the studio to get them together for a studio saving press junket in the middle of nowhere. The couple will have to be seen together, pose together, and play nice for the nice press people. Lee begs Gwen's assistant, sister in chains, and all 'round do-girl Kiki (Julia  Top Of The World Ma Roberts) to get the high maintenance Gwen to the Hyatt hideaway in the desert.Lee pays off Eddie's wellness guru (Alan Arkin) to convince Eddie he's among the sane again, and off they all go for a fun filled lithium free weekend of promoting, doting, and gloating. Oh, the hilarity! Not. But there's more in the comedy slop, er, stew. Seems their coveted last film, Time Over Time, Is being held captive by its brilliant borderline commitable avante garde director (Christopher Walken- walking through the role).Now what are they going to do? If the press finds out there's no film&#133;or that Eddie and Gwen are heading to divorce court&#133;. or that there's a funny movie in the other theater they're outta there! No press is worst than bad press? Never heard that one...The casting is all off too. Taking the Hollywood's IT gals and hodge-podging them together does not an instant success make...It was hard to believe Catherine and John as a couple. She is so much more mature. Not old! Mature. He still has that punk edge. He was wearing black leather pants for criminey sakes, while Zeta-Jones is elegant in a Bonwit Teller sheik way. And Julia...They stuck a quazi-fat suit on her for a couple of scenesbut left her sterling personality in tact. So it was hard to buy the overlooked- never- had- a -man -sister routine. Fat folks get loved too. Please.Hector's (Azaria) campy exaggerated Spanish accent was very funny for a a few scenes. But, like the rest of the cookie-cutter characters these mega-talents impeccably portrayed, he too became a heaping helping of dullburger helper in a very short while.John Cusack is his adorable, edible self. A tall slice of man I wouldn't mind sautéing a while on a long summer's eve. He is a talented fellow, who should return to something dark, or brainy. Remember Being John Malkovitcabbage?

But not all of it was so sweet.The story follows the antics of a publicist named Leo (Billy Crystal) who wants his job back. But the only way he'll get it back is by promising to make it seem as if America's favorite couple-Eddie and Gwen (John Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones)-are back together. The truth, though, is that Gwen has dumped Eddie for a Spanish guy named Hector (Hank Azaria). Leo still attempts to make this work by trying to get them to appear in love right before their new movie comes out, but things get further complicated not only by Gwen's ignorance, but the fact that feelings are building between Eddie and Gwen's assistant and sister, Kiki (Julia Roberts).With a cast like this, you know the acting was great. Crystal, Cusack, Roberts, Zeta-Jones, all great. My personal favorite amongst the four main stars was Catherine Zeta-Jones. Her performance as a stuck-up diva-like actress was fantastic. My other favorite was Hank Azaria as Hector. While not in the movie a lot, he was very funny and stole most of the scenes he was in.However, this movie wasn't pure candy. Sometimes, scenes and lines didn't use the humor potential they had. Also, the ending-which I won't give away, don't worry!-was very abrupt and left me somewhat unsatisfied. I could also talk about it's predictability, but I think the trailers were more to blame than the movie itself.All in all, it was a light comedy that was a good way to pass the afternoon. 7/10, B "},{"Title":"wrong movie","Date":"25 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I went into this movie thinking that I'd see an enjoyable piece of fluff on a lazy summer afternoon.

Enter Billy Crystal as a press agent whose career rides on getting the couple back together. And Julia Roberts as Kiki, Gwen's once dowdy sister/assistant who has a thing for Eddie.Unfortunately the film goes wrong almost from the start. The pacing is atrocious, the tone totally off and the actors, despite a valiant attempt, seem to be in different movies. Julia and John take their characters seriously. While Zeta-Jones, Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci and Christopher Walken play their roles far over the top. That's not to say the acting is bad. It isn't. Zeta-Jones is especially good (though the character is nails on chalk board kind of annoying). The actors end up being the only thing that makes America's Sweethearts watchable. They also spell out the movie's biggest disappointment. With such talent attached, it should've been a much better film.For a romantic comedy, America's Sweethearts plays it light on the love story. There's really no chemistry between Eddie and Gwen or Eddie and Kiki. We never really understand why Eddie was with a shrew like Gwen in the first place or why he wants to be with Kiki (aside from the fact that she's Julia Roberts).Even the Hollywood satire in America's Sweethearts isn't funny. The old adage 'write what you know' should apply. Crystal and writing partner Peter Tolan (The Larry Sanders Show) should have been able to take us inside Hollywood. But their script (which isn't horrible and could've produced a far better film) never really gains momentum or makes us laugh at the absurdities of Hollywood as a film like The Player did. Notting Hill poked fun at the junket with far more success. Ultimately, it comes down to bad directing. The actors were there. The script wasn't bad. But Joe Roth, who hadn't directed a film in 12 years, needed a little fine tuning on his rhythm. I'll take botched direction for $46 million Alex.

Just as the curtain raised, he said, Now let's get something straight. We don't really care about stuff like 'plot' or 'character development'. We just wanna see some great stunts, and hear some good lines.In other words, we just wanted to be entertained, and adjusted our expectations accordingly. I find the same philosophy helps with romantic comedies. This ain't Ingmar Bergman (thank God!), so don't go in expecting anything more than a few laughs, which America's Sweethearts delivers.Julia Roberts is probably the reigning master (mistress?) of this genre, having stolen the title from Meg Ryan. She's pretty and vulnerable, yet spunky and appealing--everything you want from a romantic heroine. While a lot's been made of the fat suit she wears in the flashbacks, check out how she carries herself in that suit. In one scene, while Cusack and Zeta-Jones have a passionate argument about the latter's infidelity, the vulnerable, undervalued, and perpetually ignored Roberts stuffs her face with a cookie, unnoticed by both of them. The juxtaposition makes you laugh and breaks your heart at the same time. And she's terrific when her character finally discovers her spine and starts telling people off. I also liked how Cusack and Roberts displayed a very different romantic chemistry than I'm used to seeing in Hollywood movies. Rather than relying on the usual flashy passionate sparks, they instead play two decent people who've been friends for a long time. It was surprisingly realistic for a genre (and a movie) that usually stretches the limits of believability.The rest of the cast works well too, including some scene-stealing cameos by Christopher Walken and Alan Arkin. Zeta-Jones is so bitchy you can't help wondering if she's really like that. And Crystal is great as the sycophantic press agent.It's no classic, though. Too many of the gags are extraneous to the story, the final act was kinda stagey (although that was probably the point), and the ending seemed rather abrupt. And this is yet another Hollywood movie where the woman has to change her appearance--in particular, lose weight--to get her man. Those people need to get out more. But it's enjoyable, funny, and never boring. I rate it a 7/10.

Not once did I laugh out loud throughout the length of the movie.  The gags were tired and flat.  Billy Crystal, an Actor's Actor if you consider Eric Roberts your acting idea, destroys every scene with his mere presence, made all the more oderous by the fact that he wrote the script.The only worthwhile charachters were Catherine Zeta-Jones' Gwen and Christopher Walken's maverick director, Hal Wideman.  Zeta-Jones plays the pampered bitch to perfection, and Walken has the power to wrestle humor from every moment he's on the screen, even during the incredibly bad ending sequence, in which all of the actors are stripped of their dignity.Finally, a note on Julia Robert's  fat suit makeup.  She's been praised for taking that on and adding the sixty-some pounds.  Here's the problem Her scene as the fat girl does not REQUIRE her to be fat.  She's mousey enough without it to be less attractive than Zeta-Jones.  It seems that Crystal just though it would be funny to laugh at a fat person.  Good for him. Also, Robert's would have been better served to take the Zeta-Jones role. She's far more famous, and a send up of movie stars egos by a true Hollywood icon would have been more satisfactory.  They should have gotten an unknown for her role as Kiki, Gwen's sister.I will make no comment on John Cusak.  He has God to answer to after this one, especially since his last film was High Fidelity.  If there's any justice in this world, this film will tank, but it already pulled in a bundle, so I doubt it will.  Oh well, the stars know they made it, and that should be punishment enough.

Billy Crystal, who co-wrote and produced the film, plays a master Hollywood Studio publicist on the brink of retirement.  He is recruited one last time to handle publicity of the studio's 2 big stars - America's Sweethearts (John Cusak and Catherine Zeta-Jones).  The problem is that these sweethearts are not in love anymore.  Uh oh - what will Billy do?  With the help of Julia Roberts, Crystal and company trick their stars into attending and promoting their last film together at a huge Los Angeles junket.  Then enter the formula.  Cusak (the boy who is unhappy with his ex-wife's infidelities) finds Roberts (the perfect girl who had been under his nose all along), and the two fall in love.  That is hardly a spoiler.  The predictability of this movie comes close to the rising and setting of the sun.  There of course are those cutsie romantic comedy bumps in the road, which lead to one final sweeping romantic monologue by the male lead, bringing tears of joy and melting the heart of his new love.

I'm ready to jettison vacation fluff and mindless entertainment. The credits for the screenplay of America's Sweethearts should have acknowledged the liberties taken by the cast to improvise their way through nearly two hours of self-referential spoofiness.The title roles are played by the countries' favorite Hollywood couple once removed. Seems that Gwen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has moved into a new relationship with Hector (Hank Azaria) leaving Eddie (John Cusack) in need of intensive care. Six and a half months into his two-week program (huh?) his guru (Alan Arkin) releases him into the care of crack publicist Lee (Billy Crystal) to rejoin his wife and help with their new films promotion. If there's one actor who deserves credit for his performance, John Cusack earns your sympathy, respect and applause.  Eddie is struggling with demons raised after his relationship went south.   Cusacks's the only one really acting here. Billy Crystal only wrote himself all the good lines.You've probably read the favorable notes Julia Roberts received but you may be surprised to find less than usual. A formerly plump sister (Kiki) to Gwen gives you flashbacks to her earlier size-12 version. Frankly, I'm getting tired of the fat-suit substitute for comedy. After Weird Al and Eddie Murphy I lost my patience for this special effect. I've seen more believable Christmas Santa Clauses. Catherine Zeta-Jones looks good and plays a believable prima donna, but gives us two-dimensional character that she phoned in. She's not the character who elicits sympathy and I long for the innocently honest portrayal she gave in Zorro. Stanley Tucci (Kingman) generally a forthright performer overacts the role of a farcical studio exec who maintains watch on the bottom line by keeping his head in his shorts.  Billy, throw this guy a funny line so he can stop overacting.  Maybe this film was just a series of inside jokes and the humor was derived from recognizing every studio caricature. I'd rather read a book about a writer crafting her art than another Hollywood muckraker. That was done much better in The Player and Sunset Blvd. And Christopher Walken was invited to...bring refreshments? Am I being too harsh? Yes! The admission by Cusack that he can play multiple parts (You need an entourage? I'm a paranoid schizophrenic.  I am an entourage), the importance of being in the right place at the right time (people don't kill people at the Hyatt) and the proper disposal of press (I hate Larry King) lend some moments to this bleak parody. Also Crystal lands with a respectable joke clarifying Eddie's predicament.I lost count after the fourteenth panic attack played out before two audiences - on screen and those of us who paid to see this piece of work.

Billy Crystal's script is alive with wit and playful manipulation which had the audience completely caught up in the hilarity of the story (although I did feel that the crotch jokes were a bit overused, even if it was very cleverly done).  Not only does Crystal shine as the writer, but also as the star (I don't care who got top billing or the girl at the end, the movie is his).  His character's masterful manipulation and adroit handling of apparent crises was the high point of the movie for me.In the end, I felt that this movie really had something to offer as perspective on relationships.  Questions could be raised like, Why do people put up with abusively domineering partners? or, Who is the victim when a relationship turns sour?  These questions are never dealt with in the movie (few movies really tackle issues like this anyway, preferring to settle with a neatly wrapped ending that merely skirts the issues and pretends that they are resolved).  Yet, somehow in the grandiose pageant that is played out in the lives of these celebrity characters, I found insight to the passion play that I face on a much smaller level.Would I recommend this movie?  The cast is stellar.  The script is clever. The part of it that was the romantic comedy was weakly contrived and unconvincing (not to mention a little bit repetitive for Ms. Roberts's fans).  The movie was good.  I hope that it raises peoples' expectations of what a romantic comedy, or even just a comedy, can be.  I hope that Billy Crystal writes again for us.

I consider this movie much like a chess game. Some moves work. Some just really, really didn't. Julia Roberts plays the same charecter that she always plays. The impossibly cute creeper girl who kind of gets buy at first, until it dawns on nearly every male charecter in the movie that they're in love with her. She does it well, but for as many movies as she's done, she should. John Cusak. Having never been much of a John Cusak fan, I didn't really know what to expect. His role was I think the most exhaustive of the movie, but he did well with it, and by the end of the movie, I wanted to go rent everything else that he'd been in, so I could see if he was as good in all his other films! By the time the movie ended, I wanted to gouge Catherine Zeta-Jones eyes' out with forks. She's either the most amazing actress in the world (her charecter was uber-b***h), or she really has some personal experience in that area. Hank Azaria was a waste of space for this movie. Donning a little bronzer (he played a spanish man, and he's not particularly dark complected in real life) and a absurd spanish accent (pronouncing 'junket' as 'honk it', for example) he just basically takes away film time from the other actors. Seriously. I can't figure out any other purpose for the guy. Billy Crystal serves much the same function that Julia Roberts serves. Just play the same charecter you play in every movie, and you'll be fine he's just as sarcastic and wise cracking as ever, but I think he had better sucess in the past, having better bouncing boards if you will, than Seth Greene and whoever that man was that played the head of the studio. Basically, if you like any of these actors, you'll like it because their in it, but if your going for the story, be patient. It'll get there...

I walked into a near half empty HUGE theater to see this thing. Near half empty? Wow. Four big stars, TONS of promotion (haven't seen a talk show this week that didn't feature one of these stars), a decent trailer. But somehow, word of mouth had already spread, perhaps from sneak preview audiences from a week earlier. Cuz this thing was just DEAD. Cusack (still one of my faves from his 80's days) and Zeta-Jones play a superstar couple in Hollywood. They only make movies together, and they're always big hits. But she has run off with a lisping Mexican guy and he's still hung up. Well, now the time has come to release their latest flick, so in steps Crystal as some kind of star wrangler, and Roberts as Jones slave-sister, trying to persuade them to head off and promote the film like adults. What follows is a bunch of dopey situations and unintentional drama. And that's all I can chalk it up to, unintentional, cuz when we're not laughing, it looks like some soap opera only the characters would be interested in watching. Then an utterly weak attempt at romance with Cusack and Roberts.  You can just see the wheels grinding in that scene at dinner, where the dialogue is desperately trying to draw the two together with small talk, but it's hugely punchless, and ultimately ineffective.  Plus a totally convoluted ending, which thinks it's more clever and shocking than it really is. Crystal is a much better writer than this, so who knows why he felt inspired with the material. Odd how it seems the films he ad-libs in (and you can tell his style of sarcastic improvizations), such as City Slickers or When Harry Met Sally... are hilarious, but when he tries to write it all, he comes up short (here and in other works such as My Giant or Forget Paris). And though director Joe Roth is not known by many film go-ers, buffs know that it's his past as a studio head that managed to get this much talent together. It just appeared that all the money went toward star power and glossy shots of them, along with an old-time, thunderous music score. No doubt none of these people will be Amercia's sweethearts this summer.

Anybody who's seen any romantic comedy knows how this is going to end...and it ends exactly the way I predicted about, oh, 10 minutes in....The movie started off with a bang, and I thought I was going to get an All About Eve or Bombshell movie - movies which had the cojones to take shots at the behind-the-scenes shenanigans of the theater and Hollywood worlds, respectively. But, in America's Sweethearts, the jokes got staler, the situations more inane and ridiculous (Cusak standing on a roof and geting accidentally pushed off by Crystal, the dinner debacle, the last 20-30 minutes are a monument to shallowness and asininity), and many fine actors and actresses are wasted. In a crowded theater, only two people a few rows ahead of me laughed more than once or twice.Some people like this movie and that's their perogative - although many of the positive reviews here read like press releases put out by Revolution Studios. John Cusak deserves better material than this, Catherine Zeta-Jones is a better actress than this, Billy Crystal has done far funnier work than this, and if this is the kind of material that Julia Roberts, a better actress than given credit for, is going to lower herself to, than she should give her Oscar back (giving it to Ellen Burstyn or Laura Linney might be a good start).

Surprisingly, two Tinseltown titans like Peter Talon of Bedazzled and Analyze This and Billy Crystal of Forget Paris and City Slickers 2 have contrived a predictable, second-rate scenario about a glamorous Hollywood couple with jokes as few and far between as they are feeble. They recycle familiar farcical gags, like a Doberman pinscher on Prozac sniffing Billy Crystal's crotch or a golf ball whacking Seth Green on the head while he is jogging, without much success. Gratuitous phallic humor rears its raunchy head amid these adolescent antics. The last Julia Roberts movie that spouted off this brazenly about sex was Lasse Hallstrom's Something to Talk About (1995). Sadly, as an insider's satire about Hollywood, America's Sweethearts yields no quotable dialogue, and its sitcom shenanigans seem more half-hearted than hilarious. Julia's scrambled eggs scene is as good as this lukewarm lampoonery gets.Ostensibly, the mediocre Peter Tolan & Billy Crystal screenplay suffers from unsympathetic characters running amok in mildly amusing circles under the heavy-handed helming of Streets of Gold director Joe Roth. A former studio chief at Disney and Twentieth Century Fox, Roth hasn't helmed a comedy since 1987's Revenge of the Nerds 2, and his comic timing lacks the requisite snap, crackle, and pop. Clearly, he should have seen Singing in the Rain (1952) which handled the celebrity couple break-up plot with greater aplomb. As far as he goes, Roth has enjoyed more success as a producer than as a director. The only reward for the audience in America's Sweethearts is the wonderful cast, featuring John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Hank Azaria, Billy Crystal, Alan Arkin, Christopher Walken, and Stanley Tucci.Movie fans everywhere adore Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones of Entrapment) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack of High Fidelity) as America's Sweethearts. This happily-ever-after married couple has starred in nine blockbuster hits. Everybody worships them because their marriage seems so sturdy. Furthermore, nobody wants to see them without each other in their films. Recently, however, while acting in a movie for avant-garde director Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken of True Romance), a jealous Eddie catches Gwen cheating on him with that Spaniard, Hispanic actor Hector (Hank Azaria of The Birdcage who speaks with a lisp), and goes berserk. Eddie crashes his motorcycle through the window of a restaurant where Hector and Gwen are dining, and Gwen accuses Eddie of trying to kill her. Collapsing from a nervous breakdown, Eddie takes refuge for the next 18 months in a wellness facility, the Serenity Institute, run by a long-haired Deepak Chopra-style guru (Alan Arkin of Grosse Point Blank) who observes inscrutably that life is like a cookie. Meanwhile, Gwen's last two movies without Eddie have tanked. Worse, Larry king and his 'live' TV talk show audience berate Gwen for dumping Eddie. They don't want to see her unless Eddie is cast in the same movie. Talking about movies, Weidmann has studio honcho Dave Kingman (Stanley Tucci of In Too Deep) wringing his hands in agony about the status of the latest Gwen & Eddie epic Time over Time. Kingman has gambled $86-million of the studio's money on this science fiction time travel fantasy and imagines only the worst results. Nevertheless, Weidmann has been busily editing alone without studio interference in his backyard. He has bought the Unabomber's cabin from the U.S. Government and has transformed it into his editing facility. Presumably, the filmmakers are poking fun at the late, great, but definitely eccentric Stanley Kubrick and his own last film Eyes Wide Shut. All Weidmann has sent Kingman is 20 seconds of title credits. Kingman turns around and fires veteran publicist Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) and replaces Phillips with Danny Wax (Seth Green of Idle Hands) when he learns Weidmann refuses to show him the final cut until a scheduled press junket. A desperate Kingman promises Lee his old PR job back if he can reunited Gwen and Eddie and persuade them to promote the movie. Kingman fears Weidmann may not bring the film; much less attend the proceedings, so he hopes a Gwen & Eddie reunion will distract the press from the lack of a movie. Complications arise when neither Gwen nor Eddie want to see each other, so Lee convinces Gwen's wallflower sister Kiki (Julia Roberts of Erin Brockovich) to spark her interest. Although Kiki is one of Julia's least memorable characters, she tops the nitwit that Roberts played in The Mexican. The first act of America's Sweethearts concludes with little to laugh about apart from a perverted Doberman. Acts two and three occur in Las Vegas at the press junket with Danny taking notes from Lee about orchestrating one of these events. As a precaution, Lee bribes Eddie's overzealous therapist with a new car to release the star so that he can attend the festivities. Predictably, nothing goes right for anybody, but none of these pranks will do more than make you grimace. A desert highway scene where Lee negotiates who wants to arrive first and second at the resort is dragged out far longer than necessary, and nothing about it is aggravating enough to tickle your funny bone.Later that evening, Eddie decides to visit Gwen without her permission. Although the studio booked them into the same motel, she is staying on the far side of it away from Eddie. Nevertheless, Eddie slinks up to Gwen's cottage and sneaks a peak. The sight of a bathrobe clad Gwen circling a steaming pool afflicts him with pangs of emotional distress. Accidentally, he stumbles into some cacti and gets spines embedded in his crotch. Two motel security guards watch Eddie on a surveillance camera as he plucks the stickers, seizing and tossing them away with sweeping gestures. Form their point of view, Eddie appears to be masturbating! Director Joe Roth labors for every laugh he cannot get with such lackluster touches.

They made hit films with aplomb and their marital bliss was the subject of countless magazine articles. However, all of that changed on the set of their last flick. Gwen became involved with a Spanish co-star, Hector (Hank Azaria) and Eddie went berserk and ended up in a mental institution after he tried to run his motorcycle into the restaurant where Gwen and Hector were dining. Now, their last joint movie venture is being released by the legendary director (Christopher Walken) and it would improve publicity greatly if the two of them could be on hand to promote the film. A loathsome studio honcho (Stanley Tucci) sends his man (Billy Crystal) to spring Eddie from the asylum and get him into the same desert resort where Gwen will be staying and where the film will be launched. Things would be even better if some photographs could be arranged where the public would perceive that Gwen and Eddie were possibly on the road to reconciliation. However, Gwen's personal assistant and sister, Kiki (Julia Roberts) may be set to complicate matters, as she is also secretly smitten with Eddie. Will the smoke-and-mirrors promotion work? This film, written in part by Crystal, has a wonderful cast in Cusack, Roberts, Crystal himself, Zeta-Jones, Tucci, Walken, Seth Green, and an hysterical Azaria. It is too bad that their efforts are mostly for naught, as the film just wilts on the vine, mostly due to an uneven script. Yes, there are some very funny scenes and some extremely quotable one-liners but, it is not enough. So, in spite of a production that looks great, with nice costumes, a lovely desert setting, and fine production values, the story and direction are wanting to the point where the film can not be called a success. Even so, fans of the cast or die-hard romcom enthusiasts may still want to seek this one out. But, alas, they, too, will be playing the this-could-have-been-so-much-better game.

Of the nine films they made together, six grossed more than $100 million. Then, 18 months ago, their fairy-tale story came to an end when Gwen began an affair with Spanish heartthrob Hector (Azaria) and Eddie suffered a nervous breakdown. Now, after her solo film career has gone into a downward spiral steeper than the stairs in Vertigo and he has spent countless months in a rest clinic, Eddie and Gwen are about to meet again to promote their final motion picture together a science fiction spectacular called Time Over Time. Two publicists, studio flack, Lee (Crystal), and Gwen's sister, Kiki (Julia Roberts), have the unenviable task of attempting to convince all the journalists on the press junket that Eddie and Gwen might be headed for a reunion. But there are complications - not only do Eddie and Gwen have trouble being civil to one another, but Kiki's long-harbored crush on Eddie threatens to turn everything on its head.America's Sweethearts is characterized by sharp dialogue, comedy that varies from tame to ribald (Billy Crystal's encounter with a friendly Doberman is priceless), and a romance that adds a little sugar to the otherwise salty circumstances. The movie is more about the shenanigans that go on during the course of a press junket than about any particular character or relationship. It's the way all of the stories spin out of control and entwine with each other that makes the movie so enjoyable. Sure, the ending is predictable, but 95% of the fun is getting there, and, whenever things start getting too soft, there's always a vicious one-liner just around the corner.For John Cusack, this continues his tradition of appearing in offbeat motion pictures. As romances go, this is no more conventional than High Fidelity or Grosse Pointe Blank. Cusack is playing the kind of role that suits him best - a quirky but likable guy who's a little strung out. Meanwhile, Julia Roberts takes a profile-cut to play the wallflower who learns how to blossom (she even gets to wear a fat suit to add about 60 pounds). Catherine Zeta-Jones portrays Gwen as cold, calculating, oblivious, and beautiful. And Billy Crystal, who gave himself some of the best lines, is at his cynical best, making frequent observations about the duplicity of publicists. Of the supporting performers, the most consistently funny are Hank Azaria, whose inane, exaggerated accent alone is worth a giggle or two, and Stanley Tucci, who is frighteningly believable as a big-time producer. Even Larry King gets into the proceedings, portraying a tough version of himself (for once, he doesn't ask just powder-puff questions).

Their new film is being edited in secret by director Hal Weidmann and the press are due a junket to see something that the studio doesn't have. Producer Dave Kingman turns to former employee Lee Phillips to try and get them back together and distract the media from the actual product. However things are not that smooth in reality and things are further complicated by the fact that Gwen's sister and assistant has feelings for Eddie as well.I wasn't sure what this film was meant to be before I watched it, and I had the idea that it was a Hollywood satire of sorts and, in a way, I was right although the main thrust of the film is pretty much that of a standard romantic comedy. As the latter the plot is pretty predictable and held no real surprises at all and didn't really grip me that much to be honest. However what made it better was the setting and the sheer volume of jokes about the actual reality of Hollywood. They are all pretty broad but they work nonetheless thanks to the gleeful way that the film dishes out rather cruel generalities &#150; the b*tch lead actress, the false relationship, the me, me, me culture, exploitative producers, media manipulation and so on. Written by Billy Crystal, the script rings true with what we all suspect and are told by insiders and it is fun to see it played out here.The cast are impressive and make the film better than it could have been. Jones may have done her career damage with this (I don't know) but she seems totally convincing in her role and she really does very well. Cusack has less to do; he is still a good presence and manages to keep his emotional stuff from being silly, but his character is less a Hollywood joke and more of a plot piece. Roberts picked the right role to show her in a good light and add another romantic role to her cannon but it is less showy &#150; she is very light, natural and convincing but her part is memorable for her fat suit than her performance. Crystal hasn't given himself too many sharp lines but he is still pretty enjoyable and sparks well. Support is good from Azaria and Tucci and a funny bit from Arkin, but Walken is wasted in a preposterous role designed only to bring the film to some form of conclusion.Overall this is a fairly poor romantic comedy with no real surprises to be had and a mostly predictable plot that never really engaged my heart. However the script is basically one big joke on the film business in Hollywood and is enjoyable as such; the cast really help and the big names all produce even if some of them have more to work with than others. Crystal is clearly more interested in sending up his surroundings than he is in writing an involving romance but while this damages the romance it helps the film by bringing out the laughs with the Hollywood baiting that makes the film much enjoyable than it deserved to be.

It's obvious from the very beginning who's gonna end up with who, and how it'll end. The characters that we're supposed to hate/dislike are one-dimensional downright despicable and incredibly stereotypical. The one's we're supposed to cheer for aren't much more fleshed out, to tell you the truth... they're as thin as the losers of the film, only the direct opposites of them. They're goody-goody constantly nice people, as opposed to their moronic and superficial opposites. The plot is tame and doesn't evoke the least amount of care or worry from the viewer... 'oh no, if this and this doesn't happen, this big-budget film might not make enough money... how awful!' Come on. The pacing is bad. The acting is good(enough), for the most part at least. I must say, I was disappointed by Hank Azaria as the Spanish guy... his accent was terrible, and the acting was below average for Azaria. The characters are all clichés and stereotypes. Almost all of the actors play exactly the same character they've been playing their entire careers... Billy Crystal is the fast-talking, witty guy who gets on your nerves almost instantly; Julia Roberts plays the second-fiddle to the character who carries herself better than Roberts, but is always perky and mostly either smiling or laughing; Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the beauty who knows she's hot and plays on it constantly; John Cusack plays the neurotic, nervous guy who talks quickly but surely. Seth Green plays a slightly different character than what he usually does(normally his characters are more confident than this one)... however, he has virtually no fun lines or actions in the movie at all. Now, we know he has comic talent... just look at one of the three Austin Powers films, or Idle Hands... heck, even Enemy of The State, where he had a tiny little supporting role, he was funny... but not here. The script is tailor-made to the actors, and that makes it both predictable and boring. The film has virtually no redeeming qualities, except for one scene, near the end. It involves a few very shallow people being revealed for what they really are; it had a very nice 'anti-Hollywood BS' touch to it, and that I absolutely loved. That one thing pushes the film up to a 6/10, but only that. If you are forced to see it, at least pay attention to that one scene... it's great. I recommend this to (*very*) big fans of the actors and/or romantic comedies.

The 'sweethearts' in question are bitchy Zeta-Jones and down-to-earth Cusack, who've broken up and that has upset the American public and worse than that, has upset the studio heads about to release their next picture.  Both of them really need a hit, too.  The director on their movie, Christopher Walken, is a nutjob, and will not release a copy of the movie to the studio heads but instead will reveal it at a press junket (that would happen!) that the stars are attending.  So the entire movie is set at this press junket, which is not running well to say the least.  There is no movie to screen and the sweethearts are not that sweet.  Word is not good.

What makes it all the more appalling is the fact that the director, Joe Roth, is a studio head and that the performers include some of the biggest names in Hollywood (including the biggest female name, Julia Roberts) and still the air of falseness is overwhelming. Roberts plays the gofer/sister of a petulant star and much of her scenes are in an unconvincing fat suit designed to create a sympathy the actress herself clearly doesn't believe in. (Roberts has regressed from her `Erin Brockovich' brilliance back to her whiny, self-pitying `Notting Hill' days, a very dismaying fact given her potential.) Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the selfish actress forced to seemingly reconcile with her star husband (John Cusack, badly miscast) at a press junket for a movie not yet complete. Roberts and Cusack discover each other (again, as flashbacks tell us) while the publicist assigned to divert everyone's attention from the film (Billy Crystal) tries to pump up the false reconciliation. It's a mess--unfunny and tedious with one incredulous moment after another. When you get to the climax, the film itself, thoroughly unbelievable as presented by its reclusive auteur (Christopher Walken, perhaps the only bright spot), you realize just how misbegotten the entire effort was, a fun bit of self-congratulation meant to indulge the stars and their honcho director. The fact that Crystal, normally a very intelligent writer, co-authored the horrible script (along with Peter Tolan) leaves you to wonder what came over these people. A must to avoid.

She is obnoxious, stuck on herself, lude, crude, cruel, obnoxious, contemptuous, transparent and as fragile as a mirror being carried across the street in a car chase scene in an action film.   But the question that I kept asking myself in this film was, Is this what the majority of Hollywood starlets are like or this just an abberation?  Hollywood does a masterful job of marketing their stars so that you see just what they want you to see.  But what are they really like?  I was once on the set of FX 2 in Woodstock Ontario.  I somehow managed to sneak onto the set and I was in awe watching Bryan Brown and Rachael Ticotin go to work.  When the cameras stopped rolling, Brown sat in his chair alone, and read the paper.  I meekishly sauntered over to him and upon seeing me, he put down his paper and smiled at me.  I proceeded to have a very cordial and pleasant five minute conversation with him about Bryan Dennehy, the first F/X film and whether or not he thought this one would do brisk business.  All throughout, he was very pleasant and didn't once seem act as though I was a burden.  I have met some famous actors since, but none have been more accomodating than he was.This is a film written by Billy Crystal and directed by studio head Joe Roth.  I'm sure they have plenty of information to go on here, and have personally seen many know it all's come and go.  And for that reason alone, I think this was a great film.  Robert Altman is known for his smart takes about Hollywood in films like The Player and even in an inferior film like Pret A Porter, but this film, I'd have to say is one of the better ones I've seen.  Crystal offers a harsh look at what goes on behind closed doors or when the cameras stop rolling and it is not a flattering picture.  There is also some wicked humour in here and some of it is at the expense of some of the bigger names in Hollywood.  In one small scene that had me in stitches, Lee Philips, played by Billy Crystal, tries to get Gwen, played by Zeta Jones ( who is married to Michael Douglas) to come to a party to meet promote a film that her and her former husband did together.  Gwen's new Spanish squeeze with a speech impediment, played hilariously by Hank Azaria comes in and Phillips cordially says hi and reassures Hector that he is just there for business, not to hit on Gwen.  Hector replies that he is not threatened by Phillips, he is much too old for Gwen.  Given the fact that Zeta Jones is married to Douglas, this was a very well written line and it is observations like this one that I applaud the film for.  Another astute one is where everyone calls each other by their first names except when the studio head walk in, then it is Mr Kingman, not just Dave.America's Sweethearts is a fantastic film.  It is quite funny and it is littered with witty dialogue, excellent performances, and one of the best comeuppances that one character has received in film.  There are films like Pulp Fiction and Rambo and such where the character that you hate gets paid back by acts of violence.  But in a film like this one, they get it back in much worse terms.  The ending of this reminded me of Pret A Porter, where at the end of Robert Altman's film, the fashion industry is first shocked and then like sheep, overjoyed at the simplicity of the new fashion statement that the designer has created.  Only in this film, the actress is not all too joyed to be publicly exposed for who she really is.I recommend America's Sweethearts for all that it is.  The studio was smart to market this as a Julia Roberts film, but it is much more than that. Crystal and Roth should be lauded for making a candid film like this and Catherine Zeta Jones was quite a good sport to play the role that she did. After all, maybe Julia Roberts could have switched roles with her.I also have to mention John Cusack.  He has been a favourite of mine since doing The Sure Thing in 1985.  He has grown into an impressive actor with a versatile resume and this will probably be his biggest hit of his career.

Being a huge Cusack fan, I can almost forgive him for trying to make a big budget, mass audience, Hollywood slush flick.  Almost.  This movie is so poorly acted and directed that it should have been straight to video.  What makes Joe Roth thinks he can direct?  Having money and producing films is no resume for directing.  If you want a quality Cusack movie, see Being John Malkovich or Say Anything.  If you want a Billy Crystal movie, see City Slickers or When Harry Met Sally.  Catherine Zeta Jones was very good, and even had some comedic timing in Zorro.  This movie provides very little enjoyment and a great deal of disgust.  Hank Azaria's buffoonery is an embarrassment, and Billy Crystal tries hard to save the movie by performing a stand-up routine.  It just fails miserably.

These two stars are John Cusack as a down yet not totally out guy and Catherine Zeta-Jones as his narcasisstic yet hot ex-girlfriend.

However, all is not as rosy as it once was for America's favourite couple, as she has taken a Spanish lover, which has resulted in him entering into a spiral of depression. The situation of their break-up gets worse when the director of their new film has decided to withhold it until they are brought back together. Enter Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal); the movie publicist faced with the task of getting them back together while trying to keep the press - that want to see the new movie - at bay. However, all is not to simple as that, as Eddie is having his head turned by Gwen's sister, 'kiki'...America's Sweethearts is a nice film, but it's one that suffers from too much attempted satire, and not a lot of jokes that work. Billy Crystal co-wrote the script and strangely, he seems to have given himself the short end of the stick, jokes wise. The cast of America's Sweethearts is good on the whole. John Cusack adds to every movie that he's in; his charisma and style are great and it's always nice to see him on screen. Catherine Zeta-Jones is an overrated actress, but luckily this role doesn't require her to do much more than look nice, which she does nicely. Billy Crystal, whom I've already mentioned and Julia Roberts make up the rest of the leads and support is given to them by Seth Green, Hank Azaria, the excellent and underrated Alan Arkin and Christopher Walken in a hammy and memorable cameo as the director at the film's centre. The satire side of the movie is good, but it flirts with missing the mark throughout the film. The overblown finale is nice and the way that the film shows the media handling things, not to mention the 'films' that it shows Eddie and Gwen in at the start are highlights.If you want to enjoy yourself for ninety minutes with an enjoyable piece of fluff, you could do a lot worse than this.

I'm not sure I have the answer to the question, but I am certainly willing to take a crack at formulating some possible explanations.Perhaps the fault lies in the thoroughly insipid and inane storyline, which might actually have provided the pretext for some pretty sharp satire &#150; if only the filmmakers had known what they were doing.  In this fictional Hollywood, Gwen Harrison (Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (Cusack) have been America's favorite couple both on screen and off for a number of years. Their movies are almost guaranteed to be sure-fire box office bonanzas &#150; until now that is.  Just recently, Gwen has moved in with a Latin actor named Hector, bringing to an end not only the famous marriage but also the lucrative career of the once-happy couple.  Eddie has spent the last year at a Zen-type meditation retreat, trying to come to terms with all that has happened.  Meanwhile, the studio is worried about how to promote the soon-to-be-released final film to feature the defunct couple, the solution being to get publicist Lee Phillips (Crystal) to gather everyone involved in the making of the movie together for a press junket at an out-of-the-way hotel in Nevada with the express purpose of convincing the public that there is some chance that the estranged divorcees might be contemplating a reconciliation.As I stated earlier, the plot could provide some juicy fodder for satirizing the workings of the movie industry, but writers Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan have failed to provide even a modicum of wit for the occasion.  It's awfully hard to identify with or be charmed by characters who are either self-centered and whiny (Gwen) or wimpy and whiny (Eddie).  We really don't like either of these people and, frankly, when we see them together, we don't believe for a second that the movie going public would be as enamored of them as the people in the movie we are watching keep telling us they are. We also don't swallow the fact that Gwen's sister, Kiki (Roberts), would put up with her spoiled sister's tyrannical manipulations for two seconds let alone her whole lifetime.  When Eddie and Kiki finally wake up to the truth about Gwen and begin to discover the romantic attraction that exists between them, we feel like we are already five narrative miles ahead of them &#150; a position one doesn't want to be in when the need for audience identification with the characters is as crucial as it is in a film like this one.Most of the attempts at humor in the film are obvious and crude, whether they involve Hector's insultingly contrived Spanish accent, a scene of a dog nuzzling Phillips' crotch, or a juvenile masturbation gag involving Eddie lurking outside Gwen's hotel room.  Even the film-within-a-film, when it is finally unveiled to us, is a total letdown.  Although Walken brings a cleverness and energy to his overwritten role of the film's eccentric-genius director, the movie that he finally unspools for the curious press and studio onlookers involves humor of only the most obvious kind.  That leads to a final confrontation scene - in which the characters act out their little real life drama for the benefit of the dumbfounded and aghast audience - that is utterly idiotic, inane and unbelievable.   Crystal's performance as the nervous-Nelly publicist involves little more than nonstop dithering in the form of cynical quips and wisecracks.  It is grating and annoying from start to finish.  Only Julia Roberts manages to register as a likable person now and then &#150; but even she can do only so much in a role as shallow in its conception as this one is.To say that `America's Sweethearts' is one of the worst romantic comedies of the past several years would be to belittle it.  Considering the pedigree of so many of the people involved in its making and the expectations that inevitably go along with that pedigree, `America's Sweethearts' is one of the worst romantic comedies of any number of years.

Something like that. This is a bogus, of course. No one who thinks will stop thinking in front of some unchallenging piece of entertainment, like this film, and those who usually aren't accustomed to question things, won't do it, no matter what film you place in front of them. But i understand the meaning of the concept of not thinking, and this film has a gold place in the (huge) warehouse of films designed not to be interesting, merely entertain. That's because if the makers of it didn't place interesting leads for us to follow, there's nothing to follow.Well, even in the worst swamps we have some flowers growing, so there are two things i point out here One is John Cusack. The guy is good, and brings something fresh even to worn out roles like this one. He has a strange way to place himself in between the narrative in the film and us, audiences. Is neither a real life person (like us, as viewers) nor a film integrated character. Instead it seems like he a kind of David Attenborough of cinema, someone who is in the action scene, but comfortably protected by some bushes, while commenting on the dangerous lions meal. He is great.Taking this Cusack situation, i think we have the core of this film. We have 2 plus 2 characters swinging all the time between two distinct realities in the film that of stardom, and that of the real life in the film. Absolutely everything, every joke, every romance bit, every discussion, every plot point swings around the idea that famous actors like Cusack and Zeta Jones' characters have two faces, two lives; one that shows to the whole world, shiny and brilliant, and the reality of boring, unhappy and unfit lives. In the end Zeta Jones sticks to the fake reality of fame, and that's why she stays with the Spanish equally fake character; and Cusack stays with Julia Roberts' character, someone who live in the shadow of stardom all her life, watching and living star environments all the way without ever becoming part of it. There's a public venue where all the assumptions (by the public in the film and the characters) take place. That's a golden rule of date films.So, the way i see it, we have this the real life of Jones and Cusack's characters is to their star profile, in the film, as this film is to real interesting cinematic ideas. Dull, boring, empty, trying to look bright, shiny and appealing.

Roberts makes the most of a thankless role and Azaria is hysterically funny as the foreign fiancée who Crystal struggles to keep on the sidelines until the film is released. Funny bits are also contributed by Stanley Tucci as a nervous studio head and Christopher Walken as an off-the-wall director who has turned the film into a cinema verite that shines the light on all of the stars' dirty laundry.

And here's why!","Date":"2 July 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" by Dane YoussefThe premise of America's Sweethearts sets us up for an inspired, lacerating, in-your-face send-up of Hollywood and silly rom-com star vehicles. Then it turns into one of them. Like a young mind full of bright ideas, originality and vision, it sells out and becomes the very type of evil it was speaking out against.Although John Cusack isn't as great as he certainly used to be, you could always count on him to sign up for only the highest-caliber projects. But this shows strong signs of a dry spell. I'm guessing the flowing river of scripts sent to him is beginning to run dry.Ever since Lloyd Dobbler in Say Anything, Cusack has pretty much been type-casted into playing the same role The smart, calculated, neurotic and love-sick guy who has just been dumped by the love of his life (Better Off Dead, Being John Malkovich, High Fidelity, (and seems too smart and adult for his age).Cusack has always seemed so advanced for his age, but now he seems to have grown into his age and now, he's just another routine pedestrian actor.Now I enjoy Crystal in his movies (although his steady-fire Jewish borscht-belt shtick is wearing thin). And here he does his usual bit here as a fluent veteran cock-and-bull, scam artist, fast-talking PR agent. This is the role Crystal was born to play. And he's been playing it since he was born. But the movie (which was co-written and co-produced by Crystal) has to make Crystal into a sweetheart.Billy Crystal has always been more of a Borscht-Belt comedian than an actor, which is why he always plays himself in any movie he does, and here he does his usual Oscar-night banter as the PR Lee Phillips who flashes a showbiz smile and orchestrates at lot of routine Hollywood BS and cover-ups.Catherine Zeta-Jones does a good job doing a stereotype caricature of a rich, spoiled, over-rated, over-egotistical mega-movie-star bitch who's obviously supposed to remind us of Julia Roberts. Reportedly, the Gwen Harrison role was offered to Julia Roberts, but she turned it down out of fear that people would think that was the real Julia Roberts. Hmmmmm.....Yes, you have to admit--people are very gullible and easily leaden. They need to believe that this unnaturally perfect life exists. Otherwise, what would their escape from the dreary and depressing, soul-and-bone crushing society be? If anyone ever believe Roberts to be a over-egotistical-pumped-up monster like Gwen in this movie.... her fan-base would dry-up and so would her career.With all the flavor-of-the-month celebrities out there, Roberts is one of the few, precious to have any real staying power. Don't rock the boat, Jules.The only actress I could imagine could pull the villainous heartless bitch movie-starlet off as good as Roberts would be Amanda Peet, who's sort of become a staple of weird, bizarre, off-kilter romantic comedies (The Whole Nine Yards, Saving Silverman and Whipped).Maybe she would have been better than Zeta-Jones. Perhaps it would have been best to not sign Roberts up, as she seems unbelievable as a wall-flower-turned-blossomed rose. But there is an entire mainstream religion of mindless moronic lemmings who would leap off a cliff onto jagged rocks down below if anyone like Roberts had a life that was anything but wine and roses... and red-carpet Oscar-night bliss.Christopher Walken can always, always take a nothing movie... and suddenly make it all seem worth-while. And he actually manages to nearly resurrect this thing back from the dead as the Oscar-winning borderline psychotic-director Hal Weidmann (who seems to echo Kubrick). Seth Green, usually a fiery actor, like everyone else, is dampened here.I remember thinking how much better this damn movie would be if lived up to all to the foreplay.The flick opens brilliantly.We're promised a satirical anti-dote to the brainless, bland, formulaic crap that Hollywood is dispensing. And they give us more of it. Practically, a love letter to it.We get screwed. We feel more cheated than Eddie. We're expecting some clever, well-written, merciless biting satire against Hollywood, mindless rom-coms with big-name stars in them, the film critics and journalists, and the fans who watch this garbage... And what do we get? Not an assault on the idiocy, but more of the idiocy itself.A golf ball hitting someone in the head, someone jamming a phone into a chair, a dog sniffing at someone's crotch, a guy falling onto a cactus crotch-first, fat people, etc. Cheap sit-com crap you can see on the ABC Wedensday night family line-up or on any other sitcom on regular network television anytime.I kept asking myself How could such talented people with such an inspired, brilliant premise be so bad... and boring? I went tobox office & business on IMDb and got my answer The film's budget was an estimated $48,000,000. It grossed a whopping $93,607,673, and that's just in the US.Is it just me, or is everyone is this cast wearing a leather jacket? Actually, Zeta-Jones wears leather pants in one scene and so does Billy. Was there some kind of dress code on the set? How many cows were slain for this? How much time, talent and resource was wasted?

They have starred together in a series of sentimental but highly popular romantic comedies which have made them firm favourites with the public. Unfortunately, their marriage has broken down and they have become estranged from one another, although they have not yet filed for divorce. Their last film together before their break-up was directed by a brilliant but eccentric and reclusive auteur based upon the late Stanley Kubrick (which might be a clue as to which famous Hollywood couple served as the model for Gwen and Eddie). News of their marital discord has adversely affected Nicole and Tom's &#150; sorry, Gwen and Eddie's- box-office ratings. A press preview of the new film is arranged at a hotel in the Nevada desert, which both stars will be attending, and Lee Phillips, a studio publicist, is given the task of either effecting a reconciliation between the warring spouses, or, failing that, of making the media and the public believe that they are back together again. Lee's boss Dave Kingman believes that a happily married couple is better for business than an estranged one. Unfortunately, Gwen has found a new boyfriend, a Spanish actor named Hector, and a further complication arises in the shape of a romantic attachment between Eddie and Gwen's sister Kiki.Hollywood satire is not always particularly biting, especially when the subject of that satire is Hollywood itself, and the tone of 'America's Sweethearts' is generally good-natured rather than caustic. Despite this, I found it very enjoyable and certainly would not agree with all the negative comments on this board. I liked John Cusack's Eddie, insecure and neurotic but surprisingly likable for a man with a conviction for attempted homicide on his record, and loved Catherine Zeta-Jones as the beautiful but bitchy, self-obsessed and selfish Gwen. Julia Roberts must be a great sport to allow herself to be cast as Gwen's less attractive sister. (My apologies to those who think that the words 'Julia Roberts' and 'less attractive' do not belong together in the same sentence). The best of the satire, however, was directed at the movie industry itself, with amusing performances from Billy Crystal as Phillips, Stanley Tucci as Kingman (the sort of amoral studio executive who would sell his soul to Beelzebub and his grandmother into slavery in exchange for a successful film) and Christopher Walken as Weidmann, who can make pretentiousness into an art-form in itself. (Very unfair to 'auteur' directors, but very funny nevertheless). I also liked Alan Arkin's 'Wellness Guide', forever spouting banal New Age platitudes. The one performance I did not like was from Hank Azaria as Hector, a remorselessly exaggerated caricature with a bizarre and almost incomprehensible accent. (Memo to the Editors of the Official Hollywood Scriptwriter's Guide to Ethnic Stereotypes Spaniards do not normally speak English with a lisp, but are quite capable of distinguishing between 's' and 'th' sounds). There were also occasional scenes which struck me as being less than funny (especially the one where Eddie was caught on videotape supposedly masturbating in public), but my overall impression was of a witty piece of satirical film-making. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Surprisingly, Not As Bad As You Might Think","Date":"21 August 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Personally, I found this to be fairly funny, quite cool in how it dealt with movies and movie stars, and all in all, well worth the money I paid to see it.The story is about two movie stars the guy, played by John Cusack, is desperately in love with the girl, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones.

So why did I watch this in spite of two of the other leads being a walking ego and a personality void? Two words John Cusack. Cusack's laid-back, easy-going style enables him to read cereal boxes in an entertaining fashion. And to be quite frank, it is entirely upon him that the film rests.As a satire of Hollywood's method of turning actors, especially those that form part of a couple, into a commodity, the film works well. In the film's hundred or so minutes, we constantly are reminded of how two of the leads would rather choose their own life's path rather than bend over and let the media give them a perpetual colonoscopy. This, constrasted with the hypervanity of Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, is where almost all the comedy comes from.The problem, in a nutshell, is that when Zeta-Jones is the only one in a scene, or when Billy Crystal does almost anything, it all falls flat. Zeta-Jones is just too obnoxious to garner sympathy. Crystal is famous for portraying a Hollywood publicist, struggling psychiatrist, or burned-out urban exec looking for a seachange all in exactly the same way. When he has a better actor to play off, in this case John Cusack, he is tolerable. When he has to stand on his own merits, he's utterly lost. Horse-Mouth, on the other hand, puts in a rare good performance, if only because one sympathises with her character by virtue of comparison.What saves the principal cast from turning this into a complete farce is the supporting cast. Hank Azaria acquits himself nicely from his appearance in the 1998 version of Godzilla. Whenever he opens his mouth, one can't help but admire his ability to make a bad accent work. It's not hard to understand why he is part of the Simpsons cast. Christopher Walken also puts in a well-timed performance as the eccentric director, managing to cut through the facades with a dose of honesty that I wish more films were made with. His basic call for the audience to wake up and realise that his principal stars don't exist solely to entertain them is one that today's media ought to take to heart.All in all, I gave America's Sweethearts a seven out of ten. It's not nearly as funny as a Billy Connolly routine, but those put off by the poster art should know it isn't nearly as bad as it looks.

Given the level of talent involved, I expected much more. The story centers on Press Agent Lee Philips (Billy Crystal) being sent by Studio Head Dave Kingman (Stanley Tucci) to bring separated couple Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) back together long enough to promote their last movie together. You see they had been America Sweethearts in several previous films. Gwen has now taken up with Latin hunk Hector (Hank Azaria) while Eddie is in therapy. Into the mix is thrown Gwen's sister Kiki (Julia Roberts) who tends to her sister's every need. It seems that at the time the picture being promoted was made, our Julia was an overweight, frumpy wall flower. But, you guessed it, she's lost that excess weight and has emerged as the Julia we all have come to know. Then of course Cusack falls in love with her and well, you know the rest. Crystal, who co-wrote the script and Executive Produced the film, has little to do except pop up every few minutes to keep the peace and ward off the amorous advances of Zeta-Jones' Great Dane. I think Billy was leaning on the oars for this one. Roberts tries hard to look unglamorous. Zeta-Jones does OK as the self-centered over bearing Gwen and Cusack looks half asleep in his role. Christopher Walken as the spaced out film maker and Alan Arkin (in a ridiculous fright wig) as Cusack's shrink are both laughable (not in the manner intended). A complete waste of time and talent.

It is a story of two formerly married stars that made numerous successful films together, but have now separated.  Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a pouty and manipulative shrew who left her husband and co-star Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) to cavort with her Spanish lover Hector (Hank Azaria).  They must come together to promote the last film they made together before the breakup.  Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) is the studio's representative assigned the task of promoting the film with the help of Kiki Harrison (Julia Roberts), Gwen's sister and agent.  Together they must create the illusion that Eddie and Gwen are still America's Sweethearts.The screenplay was written by Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan (`The Larry Sanders Show', `Analyze This', `Bedazzled').  One can almost tell which scenes are written by whom.  Most of Billy Crystal's scenes are obviously written by him (probably improvisationally on the set) in his deadpan sarcastic and ironic style.  These are generally the funniest scenes in the film.  However, much of the film just drags on attempting to be funny, but clumsily laying egg after egg.  The way Eddie is written, he is just a bit too pathetic and Gwen is simply abrasive.  The `surprise' ending by eccentric director Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken) is more bizarre than comical.Director Joe Roth is better known as a producer than a director, and despite having a terrific cast, he can't deliver comic consistency.  The best comedy is delivered by Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts and Hank Azaria, who steals every scene he is in with his hilarious Spaniard impersonation.  Crystal and Roberts are both veterans of the romantic comedy and together they form a solid base for the film.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is a terrific dramatic actress, but just doesn't have the comic timing for this project.  She overdoes her character's whimpering obnoxiousness to the point where it isn't at all funny.  John Cusack is always good at playing the hapless soul, but his character is such a loser that Cusack has difficulty breathing much life into him.  Hank Azaria is fantastic as the lisping Latin lover.  Every time it seemed that the film was losing its edge, Azaria pulled it from the fire with another hysterical scene.  Christopher Walken is also excellent as the whacked out director of the Eddie and Gwen film.Overall, this is a fair comedy with some very funny moments separated by boring stretches.

When the time for the movie is set to be released, the director keeps the movie 'hostage' for a while as he has to sort out a few things with it. This leaves publicist Lee getting Eddie and Gwen back together or at least make them pretend they're together until the movie is handed over.

Basically, every single frame is filled with directorial flaws or mistakes and similar critics' anti-favorites.But whether you are a professional critic or not, you have to be disappointed with this movie. What was originally the most promising in-production feature has turned out to be just a few nice moments mixed in with a few cliches and loads of missed opportunities.The opening sequence isn't perfect but it's a good opening and it seems great compared to half of what is about to happen. The characters start talking as idiotically as movie characters do usually when they're on the phone, spelling out the plot a few times to make it clearer than we would want it to be. What's more you can predict every single line way before it is said. And that sets a pattern for the rest of the movie. The direction is uninventive to say the least. It's doubtful that the director had much control over what was going on. The script seems very rushed too.However, the reason anybody would want to watch this is to see the stars. Well, don't hold your breath because they're all basically miscast except Hank Azaria. Julia Roberts is a pretty and generally very talented lady, but the material she has to work with isn't what she wants. The scene where she tries to have her big moment 'That woman by the pool ...' is just laughable. Completely wrong approach. John Cusack does some good stuff as the male star, but he ends up wasted. Catherine Zeta Jones is basically playing herself. Her performance could be dramatically improved upon, but it's good enough as it is. Ironically, she comes off better than any of her esteemed co-stars. The main problem is Billy Crystal, who tries to be mean and extremely likable at the same time. He should have just gone for being mean and manipulative instead of spending 90% of the time with that sickeningly sweet expression he has on the poster and always changing it at the wrong time.Unfortunately, it's all very embarrassingly entertaining, but the number of missed opportunities is higher than that of any recent release. Actually, higher than any release in general. The ending is the worst of it. I could have easily come up with something better a few years ago. I am 16 and I feel flattered because all this really made me feel so much more talented... That's important at my age.

The movie progressed slowly and the plot (especially the happily-ever after romantic ending) was clichéd.  Sitting in front of the screen, I could predict nearly everything that was going to happen.  In addition to the commonplace story line, I found the humor to be crude and juvenile; an audience can only take so much of a dog sniffing Billy Crystal.  As a whole, this movie lacks depth, and with such an all-star cast (Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Crystal and John Cusack), it seems to be a waste of talent and time.

Or, in other words, an idea is not enough and the result is disappointing. Having Americas hottest couple breaking up, putting the question Will they get together again? and enrich this plot with some characters that should appear quite overdone but in reality are likely to be even more strange is funny for the first 20 minutes. After that Blah, blah, blah and you have to wait literally until another 50 minutes are gone before there's another gag worth mentioning. The end is screwed up with an idea of a film in the film that is even worse. Sorry, it just doesn't work. Unfortunately there are also not the actors best performances to see so why go and watch this film? Take my advice Spend your time on some other activity.

But I know that I loved one thing about it; which is Billy Crystal's acting !It's a watchable and relatively nice romantic comedy. However it has some major problem. (John Cusack) (or John Cause-ache !) isn't a good lead. His charisma isn't that super, and in here the real comic lines come to his lips to die. I couldn't believe him as a movie star (Keep on wishing pal !). He looked younger than his co-star (Roberts). There was No chemistry between not the 2 but the 3 stars including (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as well. And, naturally, since years ago and for years to come I DON'T LIKE JULIA ROBERTS. She's unbearable monster for me with her incredibly silly acting (and incredibly sizable mouth) not the delicate funny actress that all the people talk about ! I hated the thing about the character of Kiki being fat then thin. Or how you want to spend your life with the girl who you watched her backside by a pool ? (Maybe it's a man ! or maybe, and that's harder, it's Julia Roberts !!). And despite how the climax was well-done I needed better bigger one.In any case, it's a Billy Crystal movie; meaning that I can watch and re-watch any scene he's in, and not the rest. Simply this is a movie with a major MAJOR problem in regard to its casting.Finally, I want to assure it badly  I don't like Julia Roberts. It can be my motto by the way !

Yes, making this movie.","Date":"20 March 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  While sitting through America's Sweethearts, several questions came to mind1. Is it a coincidence that in a movie co-written by Billy Crystal and co-produced by Billy Crystal, the funniest lines belong to Billy Crystal?2. Even though this is supposed to be a romantic comedy set around moviemaking, should the scenes involving the movie business really be so much more interesting than what's supposed to be the main story (former golden married couple John Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones persuaded to go together on a press junket in the back-end of beyond to promote a movie that hasn't even been completed yet)?3. Does Gandalf know Alan Arkin's borrowed his hair?4. When casting for an actress who's supposed to have cornered the market on being, as Julia Roberts says at one point, Miss Adorable, is it really wise to cast Catherine Zeta-Jones, who (even in the faux movies which begin the real movie) projects warmth and adorability on screen in much the same way that torches project laser beams? Or wasn't Cameron Diaz available?5. Why is Hank Azaria's Spanish accent so irritating?6. Dogs going for human genitalia was not funny in Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,  and it wasn't funny in Hudson Hawk. Why did they think it would be funny here?7. In what universe does the supposedly fat Julia Roberts (see the flashback) constitute overweight?8. Why is Julia's dinner scene with Billy Crystal more on the money than CZJ's entire performance?9. If the studio head only has 20 seconds of Time Over Time, why does it have accompanying music?10. Miramax heads Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein only directed one movie, and their studio is now one of the most renowned in the world. Revolution Studios executive Joe Roth has directed four throughout his career; three of them (this one, Revenge of the Nerds II Nerds in Paradise when he was at Fox, and Coupe de Ville when he was at Morgan Creek) aren't very good, and I assume the fourth (Streets of Gold) isn't either. Does this tell you something?Christopher Walken was good, however.

Is wasting the talent of so many quality actors an imprisonable offense? If so Old Billy Crystal should do hard time.My guess is that Crystal lost a lot of money on his HBO baseball movie. It was a story straight from his heart and touched all of us males over 50 who come from the New York area. We are, however, a limited audience.  So I guess Billy got killed financially and had to slap something together fast to cover his loses. Billy's gain here is the movie going public's loss.For reasons only their analysts know there are a lot of middle-aged comedians out there who write male organ jokes when they run out of energy or time to do original comedy. Crystal, sadly, has become one of them (Robin Williams is surely Chairman of this group). No, I'm not a prude (I'm still chuckling about Something About Mary), but gross-out humor fits nicely in a gross-out flick like American Pie, which is intentionally immature. You're in an eighth grade frame of mind while you watch those things.  Sweethearts tries to be sophisticated, the mix with D--- Jokes just doesn't work.  Anyhow, Billy uses three of the four basic DJ's in this flick - an indication that he couldn't be bothered to work. He did leave out the standard caught-in-the-zipper routine however, probably an oversight.The only laugh earned from the audience where I watched the movie was on the Take the poison joke.  Clearly stolen from the old Winston Churchill/Lady Astor story.  That's appropriate however, originality is sadly lacking in this flick.I thought I'd never forgive Crystal for ruining Music of the Night for me in Forget Paris, but I got over it (he's right, it does sound like School Days).  But after this fiasco I think I'll give Billy Crystal's work a long rest.

The film is boring from the first minute to the last one, just saved by Christopher Walken and Hank Azaria, these two actors always save the show from disaster. Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones don't match at any time, you can't believe they're sisters, or believe that John Cusack is married to Catherine Zeta-Jones. IMPOSSIBLE. At least John Cusack and Julia Roberts have comic talent and that helps a little bit, in contrast with the total lack of comic talent from Catherine Zeta-Jones, I don't remember this actress making me laugh or at least make me smile.

The basic plot was fantastic and all the comedic elements were there shrewish, spoiled movie star, unappreciated assistant, the confused but charming object of their affections, and a harangued manager trying to please everyone at once and failing miserably at it.First, the whole finding himself montage with Cusack's character was just useless. I mean, a total waste of space. Then the lack of chemistry between Cusack and Roberts failed to have the audience rooting for them to make a connection. The only main character to really pull off her part was Zeta-Jones. Maybe in this case, art imitates life because she sure can pull off a diva role like there's no tomorrow.The storyline kept drifting away from the main plot and eventually had the audience either scratching their heads, trying to figure out what was going on...or begging for it all to be over with already. I fell into the latter category and, thankfully, will never have to watch this movie again.

While I of course could absolutely believe Catherine Zeta-Jones as a star of The Blair Bitch Project, I didn't buy Cusack as an egotistical movie star, let alone one destroyed by Catherine leaving him for a silly-speaking Hank Azaria.It doesn't work as a romance or as Hollywood satire, and one would think that co-writer/star Billy Crystal would know even more than he's letting on here. I could barely sit through it, but the older folks around me were laughing.Continuing Cusack's usual nepotism, John's other sister, Ann, who briefly had a good sitcom Maggie on Lifetime, gets an uncredited speaking part.Stanley Tucci is fun as a studio executive, but even that's blunted a bit.

Film defines what love is to a profound degree. Forces are at work to overly simplify and idealize movie love, and that simplification and idealization is purely whitebread.Here we have a film about a Hispanic guy who is in love with a film star, played by Zeta-Jones. He is faced with the age-old struggle between a love that is fed by passion, and a competing love fueled by film idealization. The story is self-referential the dynamics of love are defined by film generally and specifically the film we are watching.Wheels grind as Zeta-Jones straddles the border between Latin sex and that snappy hypnotism of film love (something she does in real life). Fortunately for our hapless hero, things turn out right for him but not because of anything he does. Instead, the `perfect' film man accidentally falls in film love with Zeta-Jones' sister. Since she is played by Julia Roberts, we felt this would happen (or rather if we hadn't been told the story in the trailer, we would have felt it). In fact, the world will only be right when she is matched.So we have the standard progression of film love a directed glance, a kiss, a night in bed, and certain happiness forever. (The announcement is a copy of the `Notting Hill' public confession during a press interview.)The dissonance is that things are not clean. The two film stars don't end up living in a film world. What we have is two pairings each with one leg in the real world and one in the film world. But not really, Julia is hardly real world, the Latin lover has a minor film role. We are left with a strange sense of unsettlement about love. Guess that's the point this would in effect be an anti-date movie.*Cat's Eye comments result when nothing intelligent can be conventionally said of a film.

If you ask me, Gwen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie (John Cusack) made the perfect couple, even though they had broken up. There was only one person I absolutely couldn't stand at times, and that was Hector (Hank Azaria). This was because he didn't treat Eddie with very much respect. Plus, he called him a not-so-nice name. In my opinion, Lee (Billy Crystal) was an excellent press agent. As for Kiki (Julia Roberts), I thought she was a very beautiful woman. I just wish she would have scraped those glasses, though. The words that come to mind when I think of Hal (Christopher Walken) are diabolical and psychotic. The reason I said that is because he stole a film's print and held it hostage. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, Roberts, Crystal, Zeta-Jones, and Cusack have scored big time! Now, in conclusion, to all you Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, Catherine Zeta-Jones, or John Cusack fans who have not seen this sweet, romantic, heart-warming, and hilarious romantic comedy, I highly recommend it!
