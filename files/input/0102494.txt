My Own Private Idaho is about finding a home.  In his finest performance, River Phoenix plays Mike, a narcoleptic street hustler with false memories of a terrific childhood.  Mike wants to find his mother and family, but how or why he left them is never discussed. This is a movie that shows life at the lowest rung, and is very similar to Kerouac's On the Road and especially John Rechy's City of Night.  (In fact the line about becoming a fairy is straight from City of Night). Mike and Scott (Keanu Reeves) are both male prostitutes in Oregon.  Why either of them have drifted into this profession is anyone's guess.  Scott is clearly not gay, but Mike might be and their relationship is what holds the movie together. The film works on many levels, but does have its flaws.  It's faux-Shakespearen scenes make the film drag in the middle.  Van Sant directed the movie like a dream, which is what Mike's life basically is.This is a haunting and very sad tale about friendship and finding a home. The performances, especially Phoenix and Udo Kier and Van Sant's dream-like direction are what you remember. My Own Private Idaho may be a flawed film, but in my opinion, it is one of the very best of the '90's.

It isn't perfect, but with me personally, though I'm a European female and thus have no personal life experience that could resemble anything the main characters go through, it struck a chord of universality that made it heart-breaking. The pathos in it, the bitter poetry, the warped magic is just unbelievably beautiful... and painful. It is visually inventive and the casting - even Keanu Reeves's, which has been so often criticised - is top-notch. Reeves's character is a flippant, spoilt young man who goes through life acting in his own self-glorifying drama what better actor to cast in that role than someone whose acting is so contrived? And Phoenix... well, what can I say... to me, this is THE River Phoenix role, the one that can single-handedly turn him into an immortal, a legend. The Shakespearian quotations I adored the relationship between Prince Hal and Falstaff from Henry IV, Part II is among the most mesmerising of the Bard's dramatic repertoire - that play was like an emotional earthquake to me. My Own Private Idaho caught its spirit perfectly, and translated it into a context that was original in its own right yet more faithful to Shakespeare in feeling than a more literal transposition might have been. Also, I found the portrayal of Rome in the part in which River's character goes out there to search for his mother, refreshingly true to life and totally clich√©-free. As an Italian from Rome, it's very rare that I see a non-Italian film portraying my city of origin with so much authenticity. The FEEL of the place at a given time - the late 80s - was spot-on. In conclusion to me, not only was My Own Private Idaho one of the best adaptations of (at least parts) of a Shakespeare play that I've seen, but also a tragedy of almost Shakespearian intensity in its own right. It had it all the unhealthy, consuming passion (the fatal flaw), the power struggles, the young heir in his reckless, youthful days eventually maturing into the arrogance of the privileged (Keanu), the parental ghost that one of the protagonists looks to as his prophetic voice, the voice that may give his life a meaning (River's search for and the flashbacks to the memory of his mother), the intense pathos throughout, the tragic deaths at the end... that film is just pure magic to me! Just writing about it makes me want to see it again - what, for the 20th time or something?! And the tragedy at My Own Private Idaho's core is so universal, it really becomes completely secondary whether it's about and between men, women, homosexuals or heterosexuals.

I had already watched Stand By Me (one of my favorites), and it was very interesting watching him older in such a daring film. I think he was the best actor of his generation but, unfortunately, he died too young. My Own Private Idaho is a poetic and bittersweet road movie, one of Gus Van Sant's best. Here in Brazil it received a bad title, Garotos de Programa (something like Rent Boys). Yes, the main characters are rent boys, but this is not what defines them. My Own Private Idaho (what a beautiful title!) mostly deals with loneliness, virile sexuality and friendship, and paternity. It's much more than a film about rent boys. Besides, watching it the so-called modern boys would realize that Keanu Reeves isn't Neo from The Matrix, but a versatile actor; and, perhaps, they'd discover that boyish friendship may be truly sincere. 10/10.

His performance as the narcoleptic and confused street-hustler Mike is so perfect and touching and realistic that it makes me cry every time. Gus Van Sant's films often have a strange aura about them (see Drugstore Cowboy, To Die For) and never has it been more evident than in this oddly affecting road movie/drama. The camera shots of long horizon-spanning roads and skylines, fast-motion clouds, surreal and symbolic shots of houses and rushing rivers provide the film with a strange almost other-worldly charm. Interspersed with the gritty realism of life on the streets of Portland Oregon in the early 90's, and (stranger still) Shakespeare. Some of the plot (Bob and Scott mainly) is based on the Shakespeare play Henry IV (with Keanu Reeves playing the Prince Hal character of Scott, and William Richert playing the Falstaff-like role of King-Of-The-Streets Bob.) It's a fascinating, touching and very successful blend of styles overall. The big themes (the search for love and belonging) are conveyed in a very interesting and genuinely moving manner. I particularly enjoyed the symbolism and pathos the film flittingly suggests. The performances are uniformly excellent, and this movie remains one of my all-time favourites. One of the greatest (and most unique) indie movies of the 1990's.

Finally I rented it from an independent video store.I am not familiar with the body of River Phoenix's work, but his performance was outstanding in this film. This makes his untimely death even more tragic.The film has its merits and shortcomings. The Shakespearen references are unexpected, and I agree with others that they don't exactly work. They seem too forced. But they do add an interesting texture to the film, elevating it above just another social commentary. Keanu's performance isn't as flat as others may lead you to believe -- it's not bad, but it probably could have been better. I think that, now that he is more mature, he is coming into his prime as an actor. In this film, he was still rather young, and for some reason it's hard to take him seriously. Keanu doesn't quite make the transformation that his character requires. River Phoenix, on the other hand, is entirely believable, if not inspired.The film is an allegory for a lot of things. Mostly I see it as a commentary on the basic human needs for love and home. Keanu's character can go home any time he wants. River's character is searching for the ghost home of his heart; a home he will never find on a road which never ends.It's an odd film, and not everyone would enjoy it or get it. But if you're looking for something different, thought-provoking, and of course, want to see Reeves and Phoenix (not to mention Flea), then take a look.

Phoenix (in career-best form) plays Mike, a narcoleptic, quiet homosexual searching for his mother. Reeves, inevitably overshadowed by his outrageously,talented co-star, is Scott, the son of the Mayor, slumming it as a hustler. Based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, the cast and director make bold and brilliant use of the play, playing fast and loose with the rules and the dialogue and creating a glorious, freeform odyssey of expression and discovery. Noted independent director William Richert is marvellous as Bob (the Falstaff figure), with Udo Kier, Flea, Rodney Harvey and Chiara Caselli rounding out an outrageous supporting cast.Brilliantly acted and directed, with fine use of colour, recurring motifs and bold credits, Idaho possesses a rare, dream-like quality. The music too is perfectly chosen, and complements the magical dialogue perfectly. You'll never listen to The Pogues' Old Main Drag without thinking of this movie and of its central figure of Phoenix appearing from left of frame with only a black bag and a stopwatch ... of the fireside scene, and of the final line. Added to that, it's funnier than most comedies - River's simple Thanks when his pleading with a fat naked man finally gets him ten more dollars, the sight of our hero hurdling fences as Reeves tells a policeman I guess he doesn't like cops, and the superb, absurdist dialogue by the fire - and exists as one of the most honest and moving depictions of love ever seen on the screen. Delightfully, Idaho remains a film that polarises audiences it will either go straight into your Top 10 or your dustbin after you've finished it, though you must see it, to decide where you stand. Whether you love it or despise it, you will never, EVER forget it.Haunting, affecting, funny and wise, Idaho simply works on every level.

Phoenix and Reeves put their butts (careers) on the line to make a film about a subject virtually taboo for a mainstream America.You must see MOPI many times before you can understand the full meaning of what Van Zant is saying. Every scene has meaning, although at first it is hard to relate some scenes to the whole, than after many viewings, GESTAULT, you will see the whole picture.If you saw the ending a sad or tragic, watch again with the idea that Scott picks Mike up again off the highway as he did through out the film, in the final scene.  Now the ending is positive, even hustlers care and friendship triumphs.Phoenix should have gotten an Oscar for this James Dean like characterization, which no one has ever come close to since Dean's death. Was he trying to be Dean like, I think so.  Watch 'Rebel Without A Cause' then MOPI back to back, and make your own decision.Reeves simply does not get the credit he should for his best work here.  His understated interpertation of Scott Favor is masterful.  For me it is hard to separate Reeves from Scottie Favor, he makes the part so natural.  Both Reeves and Phoenix characters are so right on, their story seems true.Van Zant, who wrote and directed this classic, must have had some exposure to hustlers to so clearly understand the lifestyle. Did he use real hustlers for the bit parts? Sure seemed like it to me.Aside from the ending, the best scenes are the funerals and the campfire scenes.  How would you want to be buried, like Scottie's dad, or like Bob? The interplay of the two funerals says so much about the sad state of affairs of Christian America. I'm a Bob, so bury like a Bob.The campfire love scene between Phoenix and Reeves is so powerful, I can't find words to describe it.  Did they have any real feelings for each other or are they just terrific actors? Same question applies to Sal Mineo and James Dean, interestingly Mineo said yes in an interview, he was attracted to Dean. Ok so I'm attracted to all four of them.Anything I didn't like, not much, but I could have done without the stereotypes of the guys Mike and Scott tricked with.  Also I don't yet understand the choice of Eddie Arnold's 'Cattle Call' (an all time favorite song of mine) early in the film.  Most of the other music has obvious significance, but why this song here?This film put gay subject matter into mainstream America, in a most unique way.  There are other important films with great gay scenes (Lion In The Winter, for instance) but a whole film with nothing but gay lifestyles so clearly defined and beautifully portrayed. This is the best yet.  Every Christian should have to watch this and maybe a few will remember Jesus's teachings, as it applies here, and not accept church teachings that gay lifestyles are in some way unacceptable.

These two characters are the main focus of My Own Private Idaho which deals with common and uncommon themes, such as home, sexual identity and love. Van Sant throws in some Shakespearean language plagiarised straight from Henry IV and a non-linear narrative and you've got one very cute surrealist indie film.The credits to this film are it's director and star, River Phoenix, whose understated and moving performance lifts this film above the trash it easily could've been in another director or actor's hands. Van Sant uses symbols to represent emotional states and his use of special effects is limited and effective. There is some really heartfelt dialogue in this movie, especially the much-mentioned camp-fire scene.This film can be irritating; sometimes the Shakespearean dialogue doesn't work (and it's okay to admit that a near-perfect film like this has flaws) and Reeves is sometimes a little stiff.

And on. River Phoenix, in the lead playing Mike, is remarkable and eerie too - so much of James Dean in him, the short intense and talented life.This is loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV part one, and it transfers huge chunks of the play into the movie script, some of it sounding forced and odd. An experiment that for me, fell flat on its face.Keanu Reeves, playing Scott, plays a street hustler in an act of rebellion against his father the mayor of the town. He befriends Mike, a narcoleptic prostitute who falls asleep on the job all the time, and who to all intents and purposes falls in love with him. They go on a road trip to find River's mother who abandoned him when he was small. The details of Mike's parentage are appalling and the road trip takes them to a rather weird Italy and then back again to the streets where Scott turns his back on his old ways, abandoning Mike.Uneven and actually frustrating, the dialogue was very muddy and hard to understand at times and the shifting of script from modern to Shakespeare not successful.4 out of 10.

The best way I can put this film is that it seems like there are too many cooks making the soup and all the ingredients have been served better. Van Sant wants to make this a road movie, a comedy, a coming-of-age movie, a Shakespeare play, a surreal picture... I feel like he's taken the best elements of 'Easy Rider', 'Pixote', and 'Henry V' and mangled them.River Phoenix is excellent though, he's the best part of the film and I give the credit solely to him. Why? Because ever other performance just isn't very good. Reeves seems uncomfortable in almost every scene whether it's quoting Shakespeare or lying shirtless in bed with Phoenix, he can't pull off what this movie wants. Neither can Richert as the leader of the band of hustlers - who comes across so over the top and theatrical that as a contrast to Phoenix's mellow/realistic hustler it just doesn't work. The problem with taking dialogue straight from Henry IV is for one it's awfully hard to top the Bard for writing. Two; you need actors who can deliver it well.Van Sant has imagination and the visuals in the film are breathtaking.

Depth of characterization is the story's strength.The protagonist is a narcoleptic young street hustler named Mike (River Phoenix), who suffers from uncontrollable seizures. Mike feels abandoned by his family, and alienated from society in general. His close friend is Scotty (Keanu Reeves), the son of a wealthy big city mayor. Scotty resents his father's power over the less fortunate in society. Together, Mike and Scotty gravitate to a bohemian lifestyle, living among urban street people. The film's theme is one of lonesome abandonment. The tone is depressing.As the story moves into the second Act, the film takes an unfortunate turn. The leader of the street people, a character named Bob (William Richert), takes center stage, thus shifting the focus away from Mike and Scotty. Bob and his band of impoverished gypsies, which include Mike and Scotty, live in a dilapidated old downtown building. Here, they romp and stomp, do drugs and, led by the annoyingly Shakespearean Bob, go through contrived experiences in a way that is irritatingly theatrical. The dialogue is very talky.Later, the focus shifts back to Mike and Scotty, as the two travel to France in search of Mike's long lost mother. It's an odyssey that brings them back to America, and eventually to the lonesome, wide-open prairies of Idaho. The story's ending is extremely depressing.The film's cinematography is excellent. River Phoenix gives a terrific performance. And the music enhances a downbeat mood. Despite a wayward middle Act, My Own Private Idaho is worth watching.

My Own Private Idaho falls under the same category, except, its the overwhelming sadness which engulfs us as the movie ends which makes us feel that way.Calling Gus Van Sant's My own private Idaho, a bold and imaginative film, would be an understatement. The only other film of Gus Vant Sant's that I had watched was Good will hunting and Psycho, the latter of which was more of a travesty than a remake. But I had always liked Good Will Hunting and thought it reflected his ingenuity as a director. But after watching My own private Idaho, Good Will Hunting seems to pale in comparison.My own private Idaho cannot be described in one review. It cannot even be fully appreciated in one viewing. Van Sant explores a plethora of motifs and manages to mold them together to show us the universal meaning of 'home' and how it differs with respect to each character.To Mike, home is where his mother is. As a result he spends the entire film searching for her, for which he is even willing to travel all the way to Italy. But sadly, Mike has a highly sublime image of his mother and his childhood, which are both nothing but a faux fantasy that he holds onto . To Scott however, home is just another word in the dictionary. He's the truant son of a rich Mayor and thus feels compelled to rebel. This takes him to the streets of Portland where he takes up the vocation of a gay prostitute, which is where he meets Mike, a fellow hustler. Scott is loosely based on Prince Hal, the son of the king in Shakespeare's Henry IV.Mike is also narcoleptic, a condition of the brain which causes the person to suddenly fall into brief intervals of sleep. This makes Mike's story even more sad as he has no means to support himself and thus finds himself getting picked up by strangers and waking up in different parts of the country.However, Scott is the only one who seems to take care of Mike when he needs him the most, something which gives way for a strong friendship which develops between the two and as the movie progresses, a romantic affection on Mikes part. Together they embark on a journey to find Mike's mother, which takes them from the grimy streets of Portland to the magniloquent structures of Rome.There are lots of things that strike you as odd when watching this movie, Van Sant goes as far as he can in breaking the traditional norms of movie making. The best example being how the dialogues between the hustlers are in Shakespearian prose. I am not sure whether it works well for the movie though. But it does provide for some interesting viewing, especially if you're bored with the clich√©d mainstream presentation of plot points and dialogues.The movie is without doubt a visual treat. Its cinematography brightens up the film with its astounding imagery of the long sky engulfing roads and clever shots of the clouds looming above, each time Mike falls asleep. His thoughts while sleeping being described by scenes of salmons jumping upstream.This would have been just another film, with the audiences admiring the picture for its novelty and brilliance and leaving the theater not wasting another second thinking over what they had seen - if it wasn't for one person. River Phoenix, who plays Mike, literally owns My own private Idaho and this movie wouldn't have been the same without him, no offense to Van Sant .River doesn't just portray Mike, he is Mike Waters. River plays Mike to perfection. There is a certain rawness to his performance which makes his plight, his sad existence, his unrequited love for Scott and his drug addiction - all the more tragic. Ang lee might have spend millions of dollars in making a gay romance flick like Brokeback mountain, but the five minute conversation that Mike and Scott have during the campfire scene is more touching than the two hour movie could ever hope to be. Mike doesn't have a lot of dialogues but his mere presence touches your soul, as his face wears that constant grief and sadness and with one look at his face you can tell that he is wounded deep down.It was hard to believe River wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance. He did however win numerous accolades, including the best actor at the Venice film festival. Its so hard to accept the fact that he's gone and one wonders, how far he would have gone and how many brilliant performances he could have delivered.Overall, if you want a movie that makes you think, takes you beyond the usual grasps of reality into transcendentalisms and is quirky and unconventional. But mostly, if you need to watch some great performances, and in River's case, sheer excellence, then this is the movie for you. My own private Idaho can either be loved dearly to the point of obsession or thought of as trite and chucked down the dustbin. Either way, you'll remember the story of Mike Waters and reminisce about him with pain, long after you've seen it.The movie has its flaws, but at the end of the day when put together, the salmons and clouds do help us in understanding what and how different the term 'home' can be, which is what this movie is essentially about. So my review-o-meter points to a nine out of ten for this bold and piquant masterpiece, that thoroughly deserves its cult status, to which it has been elevated.

He cares about character and story and through the process, his artistic integrity is able to shine through his work and that is why he's considered a prominent director in independent cinema. My Own Private Idaho is more of is more well known independent features and is often viewed as a triumph of independent cinema from the 1990s.The film follows Mark Waters (River Phoenix) an aimless, misguided young man who hustles on the streets and is yearning to find his way in life. His best friend is Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves), who is also a young man and and a hustler, but who instead is running away from his life in the hope of finding something better. Scott comes from a lot of wealth but chooses not to live that lifestyle because when he's this young and wild, he just doesn't believe that its right for him.However the film is centered around Mark, who is played with such brutal honestly by the late River Phoenix. River is completely dedicated to the character and brings a wonderful vulnerability to a lost soul and it makes him relatable. We watch him go from scene to scene, leaving us as unaware of his future as he is. We watch him make many mistakes and we want him to better himself but such a task is not easy. Because that's the way life is.Mark hustles because its just who he is. We don't know how he got here, but we know that he has fallen into this lifestyle and it has consumed him. He needs the money. All of his friends are hustlers, too. He has dreams but its tough to say if he ever truly wants to leave the lifestyle. It seems that getting clients and often falling asleep during it (due to him being narcoleptic) doesn't seem to take as much of a toll on him as does his thoughts about his mother, or his feelings for his best friend.Gus Van Sant crafts a very fine film here that focuses on such a lifestyle that we're not exposed to in our every day lives and turns it into something we can all relate to. It all comes back to that road, the road that we're all on. Does it really end? Probably not. Much like in the way that Mark is shown standing on that road, staring out into the nothingness. Its really about our lives. We live and we're happy, and we're sad, and we're lonely, and we're lost, and we've found ourselves, all of these things happen on the very same road that never ends.

Having said that, when I do respond to his work positively it's a thoroughly enriching experience and while My Own Private Idaho is not my personal favourite of the movies he's made it IS a very, very good viewing experience.The late, lamented River Phoenix plays Mike, a troubled and narcoleptic street hustler on a quest to find his mother and perhaps some form of domestic bliss he revisits/imagines often during his bouts of sleep. His best friend, for most of the movie, is Scott (Keanu Reeves), a young man only a week away from a large inheritance who is also hustling in the meantime and enjoying the lifestyle and the discomfort it causes others. These two skirt around the edges of, and join in with, a ragged, rugged band of brothers led by Bob (William Richert), a man who tells colourful lies and enjoys his dubious, lofty status as the king of the streets.There really isn't that more to say, plot-wise, about the movie. While there are certain details and character arcs that are well planned and well portrayed, there is a very loose feel to the movie and a sense of the disconnected, whether it be from the characters and the way they stay on the fringe of society or whether it just be the occasional happy episode shown in a life of mild desperation.The performances are uniformly excellent. I don't think anybody nowadays remembers anything bad from River Phoenix so it's almost redundant to praise his fantastic turn here . . . . but it's a fantastic turn. Harder for many to appreciate is the fact that Keanu Reeves really can do well in the right role and this part is definitely one of his very best. He's charming, cheeky, at times he's arrogant and cold whereas at other times he's warm and caring, it's a performance that covers quite a range and Reeves does great, hence why this movie has become so adored by fans of Phoenix and himself. Elsewhere, Richert is excellent, Flea (that well-known bass player from some small rock group you may know of) doesn't embarrass himself and we get some small, great moments for the likes of Grace Zabriskie and a scene-stealing Udo Kier.Van Sant brings us into a world we would other wise be unaware of and lets us see the dangers inherent without actually putting us in harm's way ourselves. Some may say that he provides a romanticised take on the street life shown, everyone having their moment as a beat poet and free lover, but the movie isn't really about every speck of dirt and every ounce of harsh reality that these characters have to endure. The movie is about living however you have to live whilst still holding on to your dreams, however impossible and ethereal they become behind the grey concrete of surrounding reality. Yes, there are definitely some negative, downbeat moments but I prefer to take away snapshots from the movie, memories of a friend I have spent good times with and who has gone on to their own, dangerous way of living.See this if you like Drugstore Cowboy, Leaving Las Vegas, Henry V.

Mike Waters is a young drifter who works as a male prostitute. He has had a very difficult childhood because his mother was mentally ill and he discovers, but maybe he had always known, that his brother is his father. This is probably  the cause of his narcolepsy. He don't succeed in overcoming his past and the narcolepsy, making him fall suddenly asleep, takes him away from the real life and brings him in the life he always have dreamt, exactly his own private Idaho. In fact Mike, in the beginning and in the end of the film awakens on the street for the Idaho because this is the place where all is problems have starts and from which he has to restart if he wants to go on. The street is one of the symbolic images he can decide to cross it, going on with is real life, or ramain at the point of starting.  Another symbolic image is that of leaping fish that try to sail up a stream that reflect just his impossibility to overcome his past. This film is surely the greatest Gus Vas Sant's one , one of my favourite director. A shocking drama of uncommon strength and beauty. The actors are the best they would have been, River Phoenix is superlative (this is his greatest performance too and I am very happy that he had been rewarded with the `Coppa Volpi' just in my country, Italy), Keanu Reeves gives also a good performance in a very complex role, Udo Kier gives  great charm and charisma to his character and James Russo a strong dramatic charge. The cinematography is excellent as well as the soundtrack through which song there is the beautiful Madonna's song `Cherish' that stress the Mike's search  of a person who loves him (who cherishes him), a man or a woman this does't matters. During the films all his hope seem to be shattered but the end of the film leaves an open door to different interpretations Make falling asleep and being bundled into a car by a stranger&#133;..he will finally go on and find a person that cares for him or he comes back again to Idaho?

Mike is a poet who falls asleep a lot. When he's awake, his life is like a nightmare. Nobody loves him. In fact, nobody in the movie even seems capable of love. A bad place to look for love. Everybody Mike meets uses him in some way. He has somewhat of a friend in the Keanu Reeves character, who helps him on a journey to find his lost mother, and even manages to take some pity on Mike. But in the end, he's still alone.Somehow Mike keeps winding up back on the same stretch of lonely scrub-surrounded Idaho highway. A sign on the highway reads Warning to tourists don't laugh at the natives.In the final scene, back on the Idaho highway to nowhere, Mike is poetizing about the road when he falls asleep again.  Now we get a bible-like scene --  the parable of the good samaritan. First, close-up, he's robbed of his bag and shoes, then, in a distant camera shot, a car pulls up, parks protectively, and the driver puts him in the front seat and drives away.It's up to us to decide whether that's a happy ending or not.The movie is salted with some Shakespeare, and more interestingly with all kinds of American patriotic music, which Van Sant has placed wryly. As in the much earlier Easy Rider, we're not just seeing the underside of American culture here but some painful truths about America as well.Why is it called My Own Private Idaho? One man's opinion would be one guess ... Van Sant gets credit as the screenwriter. On the other hand, it has a lot of things to say about love ... some things Shakespeare forgot to say ... and so applies to us all. Oh yeah ... and maybe because I.da.ho sucks.

Somebody described it as tender but never sentimental which I think describes it perfectly. It tells the story of two teenage hustlers at a specific period in their lives. Mike (River Phoenix) is somewhat of an enigma. He is dreamy, gentle, and in love with his best friend. He is also, unfortunately, a narcoleptic, and is obsessed with finding his long-lost mother. Scott (Keanu Reeves) is his best friend, who is a rich boy and only prostitutes himself as a way to be rebellious and humiliate his father. A plot is somewhat secondary, since the movie is about the inner lives of its two main characters (given Reeves' acting talent, more like one main character) but there are a few points I will mention...an older homeless guy named Bob is also in love with Scott, although it's more of a father/son thing. In the scenes with Bob, Shakespearian dialogue straight out of Henry IV is used - and unfortunately, the story has the same turnout Scott (Henry) comes into his fortune and reforms himself, refusing to associate with any of his old friends, and ultimately breaking Bob's (Falstaff's) heart in two, and he dies. Kenneth Branaugh pulled Henry off pretty well, in part because Henry's motives are unselfish (good of the country) whereas Scott is only concerned with money and himself. When Scott and Mike go to Italy to try and find Mike's mom, she's long gone, but Scott falls in love with an Italian girl (Sorry Mike!) and abandons his friend to a life of prostitution, completely alone. By the end of the movie, Scott is in a three-piece suit and Mike is fast asleep in the middle of a road in Idaho. The film does a great job portraying the unending loneliness in our souls that we attempt to break up by human relationships that never end up meaning anything. Every man is an island. It also conveys a sense of there only being the past - the future never seems to enter Mike's consciousness. Overall wonderful, although uneven and slow in parts. River Phoenix is not a great actor, but he was much better than I expected him to be. He seems like he's from another planet, but he's so sweet all the time and never seems to have any hatred in him - not even when Scott deserts him. He does a great job portraying the painful plight of the gay best friend...and the guy who played Bob was also pretty good. Not Keanu, though. Scott is supposed to undergo pretty radical character development, but Reeves just goes on AutoKeanu which really isn't too exciting to watch, all considered.

Gus Van Sant essentially takes on Shakespeare's Henry IV; it featured the aesthetically delightful River Phoenix as Mike Waters, a wonderfully apt narcoleptic male whore who we first get a glimpse of tipping down an open stretch of road in Idaho. Mike and the action shifts from the cold Seattle to equally cold Portland. It is here that he makes friends with Scott Favor, a secretly soon to be rich guy who is also on the game played by the often-maligned Keanu Reeves. The future for both is as uncertain as uncertain can be, will Scott take up the inheritance he about to get, will Mike survive the streets with his narcolepsy? Ôøº Mike feels real affections for Scott, however Scott refuses to believe men can really love each and it would seem that Scott is only doing the gay whole whore thing to kill time and get back at his family. Mike believes Scott will continue with the grand life on the streets, turning tricks even after he bags the inheritance; such is the allure of the unknown. There are many of fellow working boys who agree with Mike's view. This is an uneasy picture, a colourful and surreal attempt to really take the characters to a different kingdom. At times, it is a wonderful although slightly glossy take on the real street hustlers shagging their way to oblivion or not as the individual case may be. Drug abuse and risky behaviours are commonplace on the streets and in the world of the male hooker and it is a small feature of this sometimes-disturbing film. The character of Mike seems almost apologetically plausible, abandoned as a child and obsessed with finding his real long lost mother. Scott less believable as the rebellious disillusioned spoilt little rich kid gone rebelliously bad. You really would not have put them together by design, but fate disregards those lines and together they embark on a quest to find Mike's mother, from Portland to Idaho to Italy they do travel. There is no argument the cinematic quality and the unbelievably stunning settings help to make this film an intriguingly striking viewing delight. It is exceptionally well thought out in terms of location and setting and a master-class for any would be cinematographer. The characterisation I found to be impressive, even Keanu Reeves played his part with just the right amount of smug pathos and humour, especially with the flippantly arrogant lines afford to him. River Phoenix works pure magic on screen with this performance and I am fairly sure I'm not alone in believing this is the role that set him into the great immortal movie star hall of fame. It is no wonder that he pulled in a number of 'best actor' type awards for this intrinsically faceted role. His campfire scene, in which Mike declares his love for Scott, is much applauded by audiences and critics alike &#x96; Newsweek claiming it to be A marvel of delicacy it really is a testament to what a wonderful talent River Phoenix was, because he wrote that part of the script himself. Village Voice said, Phoenix vanishes with reckless triumph into his role. It earned around ¬£5 million at the box office worldwide, which is quite impressive, more than that in video and DVD sales. My Own Private Idaho takes the spirit and passion of Shakespeare, bends, manipulates and shapes it to find form in a more modern setting, which works beyond expectation in the most part. Although the traditionalist in me seems to hold the opinion that you should not mess with old Shaky and if you do, you best be prepared to face the harshest of critics. Adaptations are always open to personal interpretation and modifications, which others may not agree with, like or even accept, yet this one seems to work and seems to be commended as a job well done.Read more and find out where this film made it in the Top 50 Most Influential Gay Movies of All Time book, search on Amazon for Top 50 Most Influential Gay Movies of All Time, or visit - http//www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007FU7HPO "},{"Title":"A gem in the movie genre - very emotional & moving with great performances","Date":"9 December 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I had heard of this movie for a while now (since it came out I guess) and never had the chance to watch it. Finally, I got my hand on a DVD and was stunned how could I have missed this before? I would classify this movie in the Indie genre (if that applied to movies), as its style is unusual. Essentially, the dialogs may go into long theatrical speech (literally) rather than a fluent every day life dialog. You get annoyed at times (did not expect a Shakespeare play but a movie) as some of the scenes within this style are not working out (imagine Keanu Reeves in a play - nope! doesn't work for me either). But if you can pass beyond this problem, you will find a gem. Indeed, the characters! What a treat. River Phoenix (Mike) performance is simply breathtaking and inspired you immediately feel the character of Mike, the abandoned and confused child not only reverting to hustling for money but striving for belonging, acceptance and love going in life with the dream and memory of his mother. His friendship with Scott (Keanu Reeves) will bring them into a journey where emotions and classics are all covered lightness and energy of youth, rebellion of the privileged, loneliness, burning passions, struggles and survival, loss, desire. On second thought, perhaps it works well as a Shakespearian play (yes, I know it was intended) but not only because the dialogs are like so but due to the in-depth drama of this movie the breadth of emotion it covers. The story line is flooded with the view of Mike (also narcoleptic) and appears at times as a dream. As a result, to me, the whole movie is simply a great piece, poetic, breath taking and emotional you stay watching through the theater scenes wanting to know what's next, you get hooked to the artistic aspects of the movie (music is often blending and you find yourself noticing that many details have significance) and you feel for the characters at a deep and intense level as if the topics treated are archetypal. For sure, you will remember this movie whether you were thrown off by it, liked it or loved it.

He's the character that, even though you understand perfectly that his way of making a living is far less than desirable, you immediately care for and ultimately fall in love with. He brings, along with the other characters throughout the film, something magical to the screen, as Shakespeare's work is revived once more.I'd seen Phoenix's work before, and didn't quite know what to think of him, other than the fact that he definitely did his other films justice. But after ordering a copy of Idaho, it was then that the realization hit me in the opening scenes of the movie had he have not met such a tragic, early end, River could have easily had a career as entrancing and great as Johnny Depp, who after the film was over, I was able to see, with great ease, as playing the role of Mike Waters.I received my copy of Idaho about 3 weeks ago.

The way in Idaho which is appeared time and again just like a warm face from which both desperation and hope are risen .I can catch the scene of that long way with golden paddy field and floating shadow of cloud, although most parts passed me away. Even Gold but me think the Movie-----¬°¬∞my own private Idaho¬°¬± is a film related with problems of gay, almost nothing attached in . Mike, the leading actor, is a complicated boy who came from an especially family and life, and he is really a convergence of those teenagers in fragile families and dizzying societies. From the beginning of the film, Mike has already been a sickle to his degraded career because of too much hurt, loneliness, and desperatation in a long time. But Mike is a kid hunger for true love and care, and he is not the only person who wants a warm home. Remember those young hustlers appeared as folks? I think that is one of the most successful parts of the wonderful movie. They were showed in such an ordinary way, tender, innocent, helpless. Some of them even talked about their first misery experience in a soft tone, the tone you do can feel their aspiration for love from. Maybe Mike fell in love with Scott because that Scott would not belong to their chaos circle for ever, maybe he contain a thought for a kind of natural, warm home, maybe he could help Mike be out of desperate life, or maybe just a gleam of love he can get from him. But even not an illusory emotion had he got from Scott. The scene of Mike standing lonely at the entrance of the road always reminds me of a perplexing feeling for my future in teen-age. Isn't it a symbol of our experience and state as young persons ? We are so lucky to be surrounded by love from our families, relatives, friends, but no help for your private problem deep in your mind. Everyone has a Idaho in the heart where you taste your agony , pacify your hurt, and try to find a bright way to serenity. That maybe the reason that I love the name of the film so much. I didn't know the movie bases on the play ¬°¬∞Henry IV¬°¬± of Shakespeare two years ago. Even then I didn't feel any thing assonant in the dialogue, and I think the scene form a Shakespeare's play has been successfully used in a film way, which add some fantastic matter into the desperate atmosphere . Everything you can find in the sway camera lens blatancy, cynicism. naivet¬®¬¶, depression, humor, and intense heartache. And they can't be get rid of after you ending watching for one year, two year, no one knows how long. I formerly wanted to see the film because of keen reeves, and then found River Phoenix a superexcellent actor in Mike. I can't help feeling sad when I heard of his death. I don¬°¬Øt know it is true or not that he drugged because of a will to act well as Mike. River Phoenix is an actor of something, but he had to accept a kind of trite death. I am looking forward to River Phoenix or Gus Van Sent's other films now, and I hope that I can see a same style in other movies of them. I don't know how much feeling I've express in my poor English, but my own private Idaho is a movie I wanna treasure up in memory for my youthhood.

Keanu Reeves plays Prince Hal and the scenes taken directly from Shakespeare's plays are kinda stiff.  A battle of wits with Falstaff and his eventual rejection are staged like musical numbers and the language is abruptly laced with clunky similes.  I don't think it works that well, especially since it's such an artificial subplot inside the larger drama of Phoenix's character.  Even the documentary-style look at the gang of child prostitutes and the utterly bizarre Van Sant vignettes of the tricks being turned outshine the Falstaff plot.  In fact, plotwise, it is a very frustrating film.  At one point the Phoenix character throws a tantrum after being ditched in Italy and I felt sorta the same way. All the way to Italy for that?  Crap!  That was like 20 minutes just so I could watch Udo Kier be weird looking and other stuff that could have been handled in a couple minutes in the USA?  (Wait a second. maybe they had to go to Italy just as Henry V went to conquer France with a lot of his old buddies tagging along in the infantry and marry a French princess.  Ack! That's annoying.)The jewel of the film is River Phoenix who so completely inhabits his character that it is difficult to watch.  His character has tried to cultivate a cynical indifference to the world since stress can induce a narcoleptic episode.  The problem is that he's a lonely, somewhat empathetic young man living a very stressful life.  All the film's best images and dialogue are reserved for Phoenix's Mike Waters character.  In the scene where he is rejected by Scott Favor, Phoenix does a remarkable job of showing his character's heart breaking.  So much so that it seems River Phoenix has vanished and all that's left is this bruised teenager who is being swallowed up by humiliation, loneliness and pain.  There are times when he seems like he's been beamed in from a better movie.I think MOPI is worth seeing just for the Phoenix performance and the Van Sant grotesques and vistas.  It's definitely a flawed film, but it looks and feels like they had a great time making it.

First of all it shows us a side of USA which is always hidden or ignored in the flow of mainstream American movies. It shows us the underbelly of society The outcast. It is a brave and honest portrayal of what goes on in the streets of Portland, and in every large city in modern society. Except for one film (pretty boy, a Danish movie), this is the only film I know that tells us about the lives of hustlers (young, male prostitutes). And what makes MOPI unique, is that Gus Van Sant describes them in a nonjudgemental, caring way Not gloryfying them or their sad lives, not preaching moral on their lifestyle, not trying to make a political statement. Another thing that makes MOPI a very special movie, is the surreal way the story is told. Mike, the main character, is a hustler who lives on the streets. But Mike suffers from a strange disease which makes him fall asleep at the most inaproppriate moments, because it's caused by stress. And because the film is seen through his sleepy eyes, we are always uncertain exactly where we are and what is going on. In glimpses we see his dreams of a long lost mother, pictures of salmons swimming up current, and desolate landscapes. You'd might think that the harsh environment and surreal filming makes it impossible for you to connect and empathize with the characters. I did not think so. Though MOPI deals with some pretty heavy things, as for example prostitution and drug abuse, this is just as much a film about the search for love, which we all can relate to. Mike, the main character (fabulously played by River Phoenix), is always searching for love an acceptance, partly from his best friend Scott, but also from his father/brother and the dream of his mother, whom he have never known. Both Mike and Scott, who are best friends and the main characters of the movie, are looking for love and true relations. But both come from families which has never given them love. Scott, a mayor's son, has run away because his father was not able to accept and love him. Mike's family is dissolved and depraved Mike being the son of his mother and his own brother. In the streets both kids find a new family, a family of hustlers and junkies. And the two become best friends. But unfortunately this new family will also fail to give them the security and love they need. To me the story is not the most important thing What touched me the most was the touching and compassionate portrayal of Mike, a frail and vulnerable boy. River Phoenix is amazing in this role. With raw honesty, he strips away all defenses and shows us a young man, who is deeply wounded and always looking for love and accept, but never getting it.

Now I have seen it again, again and again I am noticing small detail I have missed the first times around.  I think the film is brilliant. My father I know would hate it and it would be switched off inside the first ten minutes! Although it makes me wince a bit if you look past the first 10 minutes, it truly is a masterpiece. People who remark it is boring are not watching it. It is dark, it is humourous. I even love the long road (I would love to see it for real).  Even though I am a true Keanu Reeves fan I think we have to allow that Phoenix (Mike) is the best actor. Also that the film is axised around him and his desperate need to anchor his life because it is squalid and to find his mom for security. Like putting daises in a pile of dung. Phoenix (Mike) at the beginning of the film when he is in a sexual part with Walt when he sits up at the end; it is all too real. The criticism on the Shakespeare bit, well if Gus can throw in falling cattle sheds onto roads at sexual climax and cut to spawning salmon in a lake he can throw in Shakespeare too. Funny parts, when they ambush the rock n roll promotors and then Bob tells his lies to the group there was seventeen of them and they had it out with me. The Daddy Carrol episode scrub my little dutch boy and hands phoenix ridiculous looking house slippers so he wouldn't mess up his house!!  Keanu retelling the truth of what really happened to the story of Bob's failed robbery and much much more.  Although the main characters are mike and scott even the other denizens are required to make things happen and are they not cool, all of them. Also the bit when they go to visit Mike's father Dick I though was really good acting again by Phoenix. Bud to Bob The things we've seen. Bob Yes we have heard the Chimes at Midnight. That we have Bob That we have. Gees, the things WE'VE seen. It seemed that everyone in the film was in love with Scottie. I also found their journey of meeting weird and wonderful people like Hans (see his performance with the lamp). I thought I bet people really do exist like that and this is just too weird n wonderful. In the end Keanu gets his dead father's inheritance and married the french girl (how jealous of her was I) and Mike stays put in his world with the street denizens and dreamlike world he occupies.   I would like to have been that man for a moment though when he kisses Keanu at the bonfire.  Incidentally, can anyone out there tell me if that was meant to be a situation that really took place or was it one of Mike narcoplectic moments. He is on the floor after while Keanu is still starting the motorbike! Only Gus could tell. Ya jus don't know how much I love this film. For other films similar but far darker I suggest London Kills Me which is set in London in '97 against a backdrop of rave culture.

Deep and sincere characterization of Mike Waters and River Phoenix`s portrayal of that character are priceless jewels. As many other reviewers here already said, Mike goes through his sad, lonely life of a young male prostitute always in search of love and acceptance... by anyone. His loneliness is beyond words, he doesn`t have absolutely anyone who cares for him in the entire world, and so he dreams about his mother comforting him, during his frequent deep sleep attacks by narcolepsy. His everlasting hope is to find his mother again, and be safe in her embrace, but he would settle for the romantic love of his best friend Scott, also a young hustler. Mike sells his body to men and women, and tells Scott he`s in love with him, but we actually don`t really know if he`s gay - he is just so desperate for any kind of love, affection and tenderness, from man or a woman, a boyfriend or mother, never mind.He embarks on a quest alongside with Scott to finally find his mother, and wherever they arrive during that quest, Idaho, Rome, a small Italian village, he is so certain he`ll find her this time, but he always fails. Then Scott, his only companion, finds a girlfriend and dumps him in the middle of foreign country, and Mike is left all alone in the world again. Then, at the end of the film, he`s back on that road in Idaho, looking at the desolate landscape, dreaming about his mother... And then he suffers another narcoleptic attack, falls asleep in the middle of the road. Someone stops his car, picks him up and drives him away, and first you can only wonder who picked him up, is it someone who will help him and care for him, or not... maybe Scott, the object of his romantic affection, maybe his brother, who is actually his father... or maybe his mother... you never know. Perhaps good fortune has finally smiled down on the poor boy who suffered so much in his lonely life.And later, if the movie really touched you in a deep and profound way, like it did me and many more people, you could also imagine that it was you who stopped that car and picked Mike up... and drove with him to some place safe and quiet, where you could just hug him and tell him he`ll never be alone again, and then just hold him in your arms and care for him... because he needs it, human warmth, human touch, sincere human love, so very badly.This is the gentlest, sweetest and most delicate and beautiful and emotionally powerful movie that I have ever seen. I was so sure of that when I just thought about the words in that sweet title, and they almost made me cry.This is a beautiful, complex, symbolic movie... many things will be unclear to you at first, many things illogical and strange, but you will discover its real beauty and tenderness when you will be thinking about it later, pondering every scene and remembering every significant little detail, of this dreamy, touching, quiet masterpiece. And it would never have been possible without River Phoenix, a brilliant actor with a beautiful talent, whose unforgettable, fascinating performance is the very core of this movie.Beautiful.

Not often do you find a cinematic endeavor so full of angst, loss, despair, frustration, yet at the same time, in the same film, almost simultaneously, you also discover and experience celebration, joy, peace, and finally, resolution.Essentially this film is a collage of portraits. It's not just about Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Every character has their own tale, from Bob Pigeon and Bad George, to Hans and the nameless male hustlers who stand alongside River in a few scenes.The truth that is housed within this film is told in unflinching detail. River Phoenix owns this element of the movie. His scenes are egg-shell delicate, yet at the same time, his character exudes a strength and consistency that none of other characters seem to have. Mike Waters is Mike Waters. He is consistent throughout the film. Yet, at the same time, he is a breakable soul, and it's almost painful in certain parts of the film to watch him.I could go on forever, but I won't...Every aspect of this movie strikes a chord with me, from the masterfully filmed images that bring a level of symbolism to the film--The salmons swimming upstream, the wooden house crashing to bits.The fact that when River Phoenix rewrote some of the dialogue, he undoubtably had a hand in giving his character the last name of Waters, and Mike's mother's name-Sharon Waters. (For those of you who don't know, River's mother's real name was Arlyn Sharon) I doubt that this is coincidence. Mike also speaks about a movie- Rio Bravo. Again, Rio/River, this is no mistake. River Phoenix purposely places himself in the character of Mike Waters, and he wants you to see his signature in every single pore and essence of Mike Waters. He doesn't want a separation of character and actor. He wants the blend to be flawless, seamless. This is why without River Phoenix, this film never could have possessed the level of truth that it possesses.Too bad that there are not more films being made like this one. Too bad River Phoenix is not here anymore to act in them.

Though I'm sure this is the effect director Gus Van Sant was aiming for, the movie looks very crude and low budget, it may have even been shot on 16mm. The only positive effect this has is that it seems to be happening to us, and that the movie was made specifically for us, and no one else. This is hardly the main reason that it's, to be frank, messed up. It's obvious that any movie that opens with the main character (in this case Mike, played by River Phoenix) getting a b***job is not going to be another Hollywood money pit.There is quite a bit to be admired about the film, however. One is the caliber of the acting, especially the surprise given to us by Keanu Reeves. That's right- he actually acts here. This is likely the only movie he's ever been in where the word 'dude' is not in the script. He easily delivers a career best performace here, not a hard feat by his standards. The rest of the cast, made up mostly of no-names, is also exceptional, and the acting may be the only thing saving this movie.My advice is to see it only if you're a fan of art house films, or of either of the two stars.

It's not entirely a masterpiece even as it strives to be one ever so much, but damn all celluloid to hades if it isn't some kind of 'experience' to get through it all, and usually in moving and hallucinatory ways. My Own Private Idaho mixes and matches, strikes together images and sounds and cuts and time-lapses and angles and characters that leave a mark on the viewer, like watching Godard make something quick if he wandered into a gay bar screening Un Chien Andalou and had to contend with a group of hustlers and other random crazies while also carrying with him some selected Bard. This isn't Brokeback Mountain, aside from that one little tender scene (one of my favorites if only by River Phoenix's acting) where Mike confesses his true love for Scott (Keanu Reeves) when the latter just has sex with men for money and is decidedly Bi-curious. It's indescribable in tone if not in plot; we are basically dealt with two street hustlers, one a practical orphan with medium-grade narcolepsy and the other a dejected son of a mayor who sits on his thrown like a dying king... or Henry the 4th for that matter. The rest kind of flows from that, with Mike trying to find his mother and Scott going quickly into his, well, destiny of sorts.Sure, having a movie that mixes documentary (tell me some of these guys weren't picked off the street by Van Sant?) and a kind of magical realism (yes, magical realism) that involves fish jumping upstream and 8mm filmed dreams of Mike's family plus the general illusionment of waking up somewhere random and alone PLUS Shakespeare is jarring. Most notably, indeed, when Shakespeare is pretty much lifted right off the page and given just a touch of gutter-talk or gritty Bowery-level attitude and wildness. It's so strange and original a move, and the actors all play it so sincerely, that it's hard sometimes to totally take seriously with the Falstaff aka Bob played by William Reichert as the Fisher King as a ruler, and Flea as a screaming/crying banshee... And yet, there are chunks where this method works, and one gets accustomed and accepts and gets wrapped up in this patchwork, such as when Bob and his men in pink monk clothes rob and fight with other street folk at night. It's so crazy it just about works which is incredible on its own, not to mention with special/awesome appearances by Grace Zabriskie and in Dean Stockwell ala Blue Velvet form Udo Kier!Also incredible is River Phoenix. People talk today about the lasting impact Heath Ledger will have following his passing and leaving behind the Joker (and, as some might forget, Bob Dylan). Phoenix as Mike Walters is that kind of performance only in the art-house setting, something really challenging and heartbreaking to see. This is a truly great performance, perhaps amplified even more by (or because of) Keanu Reeves who while very good and better than some would ever give him credit for is overshadowed by this brooding and harrowing force right next to him. Phoenix somehow makes us care about this character maybe more than Van Sant would want us to, and that too is something special.Even if you don't care very much for the movie itself, how Van Sant films and directs in his own hit or miss (this time mostly hit in a burgeoning iconoclastic) style, it's hard to argue the tenacity of the actor on screen, and his impact left if only here and in Stand by Me. 9.5/10 "},{"Title":"Mike so-called life","Date":"24 December 1998","Score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Can't find a word to describe my feeling to this amazing movie, I mean, Gus Van Sant is an expert for this type of film,obviously , Drugstore Cowboy!

Gus Van Sant's erratic, hilarious and creative storytelling of a gay narcoleptic hustler is one of a kind in the sense that you rarely witness a story being explored in such a unique way. It is important to note that the narcolepsy our protagonist experiences, together with a short-lived childhood and rough situations lead him to a scattered, direction-less existence. This is portrayed incredibly well by Gus' direction and Phoenix's performance, as Mike's life is reflected by the fragmented and hazy nature of the film itself. Being narcoleptic, Mike has no chance of leading an ordinary life, as these bouts of sleep leave him powerless, in the hands of nature and others, and it is apparent that at some point he stops caring about where he will end up next or where he will be in a day, month or year. Instead, Mike's only able to live hour by hour, hustling from one guy to the next, not really sure whether a particular event has truly happened or if it is one of his many dreams. It is a strange and touching story, told in an even stranger and incredibly refreshing and original way The magazine poster guys talking to one another, sharing thoughts on life as a hustler, sexual acts depicted through still erotic poses of the participants, and above all Bob, a character who is both a pathetic, fat thief and a spiritual, guiding poet. The kids One of the most entertaining aspects of this film is delving into the lives of these hustlers, listening as they share their traumatic experiences with a sincere honesty and optimism, watching as they celebrate the life of their teacher and friend, Bob the Poet, by yelling and jumping and going wild; these kids were full of life. Mike Michael's character is potentially the most vulnerable character I have seen on film; this person has no choice but to surrender to the hands of whoever happens to pass by as he goes through life in a state between reality and dreaming, never truly aware of where he is or when he wakes up. It is incredible to see Phoenix portray this complex character, one who does not seem to have any direction in life but one who longs for some kind of intimacy with someone, a highly ironic take on the fact that he supports himself by sharing intimate physical moments with strangers. Mike is often found talking to himself, lost inside his own head. He sees clips of himself with his mom dancing and visualizes these isolated wooden houses when he goes under. He has a deep urge to find his mom and with the help of his best friend he tries to locate her, finding himself falling in love with this guy and getting his heart broken when the guy falls in love with another girl instead. To see a guy that does not confide much about himself be so exposed and so vulnerable and express his love for this guy in such a fundamentally human way, to see him try to hug the person that is trying to undress him, longing for some kind of true intimacy with a human being; these little peaks into the soul of this kid that is most often seen lost in his drug-influenced mind are what make this film so immensely beautiful. One should not fail to mention the humor of this film, with scenes like the prank on Bob and the other thieves, Hans performing his outrageously bad one man show while holding a lamp. These scenes play an important part in the film as they give realism to the story, instead of the director and screenwriter opting to dramatize the already-dramatic lives of these young adults. It also shows the spirit of these kids, a spirit indestructible that manages to laugh at times like this and not take itself too seriously. Idaho signifies a special place for our character, a place he returns to every time he falls asleep, and a place where his fondest earliest memories exist. It is also the place where he'd shared a road trip with his best friend and where he'd confided his love for him. This road will never end, our character says, signifying both the endlessness of his situation as a narcoleptic hustler and on the other hand a sense of safety in this familiar road, and this is depicted in the very last scene of the movie, where Mike gets picked up by a stranger or possibly his close friend after being robbed by 2 others.

There is the quiet, brooding masterpiece which has at its core River Phoenix and his search for home and comfort. And then there are the lesser parts of the sum, loosely inspired by Shakespeare, that seem to want to complicate the plot and insert these moments of literary richness. The scenes with William Richert's Falstaff inspired figure take on a strange morphing of the speech, not completely copying the language of the Bard but applying a modern twist on it. What results is a strangely stilted dialogue that doesn't have the poetic and symbolic power of the original, yet is decidedly stiff and uncharacteristic for the manner of street bums. It takes powerful moments from the play, such as Hal's rejection of his mentor and father figure, and renders them stale and emotionless. The real power is in that funeral scene, where the group sing and dance of the late Bob while a cold, frozen Reeves looks on from his own removed domain, no longer a part of them. It's a stunning juxtaposition, and you can feel the regret two ways as they attempt to miss each other's glance. This is more acceptable than the other theatrical moments of the film, such as wildly flamboyant client who has Mike scrub his floors, and a salesman who puts on a wonderful show and dance in the midst of their wanderings. These feel less natural and more of an obligation on the part of Van Sant, as if he was the Bard himself, trying to please a royal patron. So, not as to dismiss these segments of Shakespearean influence, but the real meat of the story is with Mike. He has an odd condition called narcolepsy which has him collapse and sleep at odd times of the day - and this isn't just a technique to feign vulnerability, but embedded within his character entirely. His dreams are the most integral clues to unlocking his psychosis; there is a long straight road that seems to go on forever and onto nowhere, and he peers all around to no avail, and retreats to his late mother's lap instead. Van Sant overlays these dream sequences with red-blooded American country music that sings about their proud land and country and all the wonderful things it holds. It becomes tragically ironic, but also with a slight solace, because they abruptly cut out once he wakes up and he is back in reality, and somehow in the midst of a client's session. It is suggested that he is almost trying to hide away in his dreams and reject his real life - see the strange way in which Van Sant's blocking hides the identity of the client as he walks away after he is done with his 'business'. And of course there are those gorgeous time-lapse sequences where the clouds rush over the never-ending plains. Their fleeting, elusive beauty renders Scott and Carmela's lovemaking almost robotic in its static still-frames.River Phoenix is the real star. Not only in his shattered, clipped dialogue, but in his body language. The pivotal confession of love by the campfire is made doubly vulnerable and heartbreaking by the way in which he hesitatingly spits out each pained line, and then curls up into a ball as if he were naked and completely exposed. Later upon rejection, he will desperately collapse on hard pavement and succumb to his condition all while sobbing - he makes this an art, not just releasing tears but allowing his whole body to break down and shake uncontrollably all while a unsuspecting Scott passes by in his car. He seeks solace in his usual clients, and for a brief, tiny moment, he seems to find it...oh, before they begin to pull his clothes off and reveal their truer desires. The initial intention was to have simply blackouts cuts to indicate Mike's narcolepsy. Instead we have these moments of pure bliss, that speed by all too fast and slip out of his hands. Clayont's editing is erratic and visualises his condition; they will jump forward in time in the blink of an eye, and cut during action jarringly, as if to indicate another narcoleptic episode that robs Mike of whatever pain or pleasure he was experiencing. In one instance, he runs desperately into his mother's former home, as if expecting an embrace, and the footage switches to that grainy, nostalgic POV vision, shaky and nervous, betraying his innermost desires, and then it quickly speeds past the memory jolt, and then back to him sobbing into Scott's arms. This is a masterful bit of film-making; to elicit such a strong emotional reaction but to do it in such a way that robs the character of any moment of solace. And we understand. Van Sant himself is openly gay, but there is not even a hint of personal circumstances or experiences that drive this film forward, but a feeling of universal loneliness. There is a secondary tragedy that this film evokes; that the young River Phoenix, such a tremendous talent, was taken much too soon.

The famous campfire scene between River Phoenix's Mike and Keanu Reeves' Scott is heartrending. The powerful confrontation between Phoenix and James Russo as Mike's brother is equally memorable. The high passions running in both section are counterpointed by the inscrutability of Reeves'face.

Van Sant does an excellent job of capturing the dream life of a street youth looking for love and acceptance (River Phoenix) and a rebellious rich kid looking for kicks (Reeves).  The movie takes a turn as Reeves, as Shakespeare's Prince Hal, returns to his place in society and rejects the merry band of homeless men from whom he learned so much.  Only then does Van Sant make the correlation with Henry IV obvious.  Portlanders will recognize that nearly all the scenes (minus Italy) were shot in Oregon.

It presents very powerful concepts, such as the alarming humanity of the homeless young and the transcendence of love and admiration, but it does not draw them into a powerful and definite conclusion. Instead, it leaves the viewer license to imagine and ponder, evoking the special thoughts that only art can.  It is not without determinate moments, though (Van Sant's surrealism notwithstanding) the funeral of Bob Pigeon, the sex scenes, the clients.  The mysterious allure of this film is that it blends such stark visual imagery with vagueness, presenting, not coincidentally, vague recollections of a happy childhood, and concluding irresolutely, instilling the forlorn sense of motion and questioning that the movie's story carries with it.

He creates such a style and performance originality, in this real out there offbeat film, we are still reminded, of what a super great or more correctly, unique actor, he was, his acting talent and versatility, stretching more, than that of De Caprio. Along with Reeves, who's fair here, they're homeless hustlers, who dirty old pervs, mainly men, pay them for their services. Phoenix is on a search to find his mother, that takes him, with best friend Reeves, across a few states, to no avail. The film has comical moments, as well as some intriguing scenes, this fascinating piece of work, is not tainted one bit, in it's twenty two years of it's existence when watching it. Rich handsome, older perv, Hans (Udo Kier) has one trademark scene, where he's doing an exotic dance, lamp and all, to an old fifties tune, for our two hustler's benefit. A later scene has the three in a naked menois de trois of pose shots, Phoenix wearing bra and panties, that honestly wanted to make me puke, as a couple of other scenes did, like one young hustler, describing some sexual wants of his customer. I loved James Remar in this, his confrontation with Phoenix, when trying to pass him off as not his real father, his corny story I loved. The scene stealer here, was the veteran homeless drunk, Bob, a deep charismatic, and thespian orchestrated performance. What was the real heartbreaking moment of the film to be honest, was the severing friendship of Phoenix and Reeves towards the end, as Reeves falls for someone of the opposite sex, while turning his back on his whole homeless troupe. Reeves living up the high life after pop passes away, had me questioning if this was real, as it just seemed weird, in light of all that happened before this. o me this part didn't seem real. A lot of images to this film (dolphins flying through the sea, a barn crashing down, etc) and many other offbeat attractions, make this film, one of those fascinating and undying classics of peculiar tastes. I couldn't understand though as a hustler in this, Phoenix, wasn't attracting much female clientele. The whole attraction to this film is it's weirdness, and it doesn't stop, being weird right up to the end. If you love River Phoenix, you have to watch this film. Gus Van Sant's most daring work. I mean how often do you see Keanu atop River, rolling around under covered sheets.

He's way out of his league with this kind of material. And these sections of the film, especially the group exchanges in the broken-down tenement house, seem badly edited, those conversations unclear in terms of point and plot --- and I've seen the movie multiple times.It's a shame Van Sant went down that road (the characters, specifically Keanu, breaking in and out of classical speech, which simply doesn't work), because there are many things about this picture that are really terrific... So view it with this in mind....and this after the first couple of viewings of this hauntingly-odd picture, the flaws just seem to melt away and don't matter so much.And you can almost always tell a (potentially) good flick when it manages to inexplicably capture the zeitgeist of its era; in fact, I'm not sure I've ever seen one that evokes the cusp of the 80s/90s as vividly. (So did Midnight Cowboy for ITS era, so maybe male hookers is all that's really required. Go figure.) Even Keanu gives a better performance in the normal (non-Shakespearean) scenes than usual.And, as with every single River Phoenix movie ever filmed, this one is chock-full of eerily prescient moments of doom like River seizing on the road, sidewalk, etc...

However, having read both parts, watched a BBC version of both parts, and also seen an amalgamation of both plays on stage I can say that I am much more familiar with it so that I can have a different understanding of this film.When I had first seen the film I had liked it, and I must say that I still like it, but the second time around, including being more familiar with Henry IV, I must say that it did not appeal to me as much. In part I think Van Sant has pulled away significantly from the original play with regards to the themes of the play as well as with regards to the character of Scott (played by Keanu Reeves and is Hal from the play). In a way Scott and Hal are both rebellious teenagers, but Scott is much more conscious of his desire to 'come good' when he turns 21 whereas this does not seem to be the case with Hal. In fact Hal has to prove to his father that he desires to become good, whereas it is clear from the film that Scott is in no danger of losing his inheritance.In Henry IV Poins is more of a supporting character who acts not so much as Hal's conscience but rather as a friend. In the film though Mike (River Pheonix, who corresponds with Poins) plays a much more important and central role. In fact the film is actually focused on Mike, as he goes on a fruitless search for his mother. There is tension between Mike and Scott because it is clear that Mike loves Scott but this love is not returned. This is something that we know is never going to happen, particularly when Scott says at the opening that as long as you do it for money then it is okay, but as soon as you begin to do it for free, you grow wings (and with that he then looks up at Mike as if suggesting that Mike has already grown wings). Another difference we see is that Scott readily deserts Scott when he gets his inheritance and finds the woman that he takes as his wife (though there is no indicating that there is any love, and we raise the question as to whether Scott is capable of love).Henry IV is many cases is about the right of passage that Hal takes from being a rebellious teenager to becoming a king, but this is something that we do not necessarily see here. Scott is not going through a rite of passage, nor is he learning, he is just having fun and behaving like a child while he is a child, and when he comes into his inheritance, he rejects his past and moves on. Okay, at the final scene, were the two funerals are contrasted (and one could say that both of Scott's fathers have died and are being buried) we see a part of Scott looking on at the other funeral. In a way the past has died, but one past, that of the wild and chaotic nature of youth, is also being buried to be replaced with the cold, clinical nature of adult life.I actually found Van Sant's attempts at Shakespearian language to be rather contrived. In the two scenes which are clearly taken from the play, that of Scott's rejection of Bob (who is the Falstaff figure) and the scene were he is mocking Bob after the robbery, we see that Van Sant is trying to create the poetic nature of the original play but using modern language in doing so. To me this fails completely. I can sort of see what he is going, and in a way he is using the play to build upon Scott's character, but the thing is that the movie is focused on Mike and not on Scott.Mike is vulnerable in many ways. Not only does he not understand himself, or even his sexuality (he confuses friendship with erotic love, and this is something that is not returned) he suffers from Narcolepsy. As long as Scott is around, Mike is safe, but as soon as Scott leaves we discover that he is more vulnerable than ever. In a way Mike's search for his mother is his search for security, in the same way that his quest for love is also his quest for security. We know that as long as Scott is around, Mike is secure, but when we see him on the street, back in Portland, we know that this is no longer the case.Then there is Idaho. The movie begins in Idaho, ends in Idaho, and visits Idaho in the middle. It is as if it is this tranquil place between the horrors of the world outside. It is the world of the unique, of the quite, and of the peaceful that pushes away the world of the street. We see the street in Seattle, in Portland, and even in Rome. Granted, we leave Rome for the country, but in a way it is not Idaho. Mike feels secure in Idaho, but not in Italy. However, we learn at the end that no even Idaho offers that protection, for when he collapses again, he is robbed. I guess the idea of the title suggests that is the case, one's search for peace, and that part inside of you were you can feel secure.

Thinking back, this was a milestone for me my first gay themed movie and before I was out. It was when I was barely beginning to know what the gay lifestyle was all about. Thankfully, I didn't take it all to heart, as this was not only more than a gay themed movie, but it's also a much darker side as well as just one aspect of the lifestyle, namely prostitutes.Of course, it helped, I was in love with River Phoenix at the time (who, sadly passed on a few years later.) And it opened &#x96; wide open &#x96; the future viewings of independent cinema. After watching this now, the very first time since late 1991, I can see this is the epitome of independent movies.Mike (Phoenix) suffers from a lot of what life dealt with him, namely and most obviously, narcolepsy. He's lost (literally) and holds on to his one love, Scott (Reeves) and his hope of reuniting with his mother. Scott takes care of him, and shows the one human side to his character looking out for poor/always falling (again, literally) into a deep, uncontrollable sleep.Mike lives on the street, hustling to mostly men in order to survive, but through his many sicknesses. Meanwhile, best bud, also street hustler Scott is set to inherit a rather large amount of money on his 21st birthday within the week from when the movie begins. Scott hopes to just live it up with his zany co-prostitutes and street robbers/sex-for-hires until he can safely turn his life into fame and fortune. But, again, he continues to take care of Mike and furthers his journey (possibly as a way to break up the boredom) to reunite with the mother of his memories.In a time where gay was still relatively taboo, I applaud Gus Van Sant for making the movie he wanted to, despite the still-general public ignorance. It's rather weird, and certainly not mainstream by any means. And having it not only based solely on the Shakespeare play of Henry IV and V, you'll truly feel that theatre presence in many of the scenes.In addition, the movie is mostly a sad romantic road picture about wandering and lost souls. At least you have a character to root for (Mike) and as sick as he is (inside/out,) you'll want to find his lost home. His lost mother.The movie's only real downfall you'll experience &#x96; that is, if you didn't get most of the symbolism, or what Gus Van Sant was trying to say &#x96; is, once again, Reeves. He continues to prove himself to be the world's worst actor. Ever. Phoenix and the rest of the cast were not only astonishing and believable, yet, Reeves is as wooden and stale as a 30-year-old fallen dead tree. As in most of his movies, it's as if he's standing as erect as he can while reading cue cards. How he would benefit if film students would simply give him some acting lessons.Nevertheless, the rest of the movie has wonderful cinematography and good music. Recommended for lovers of independent films and for people with the understanding of groundbreaking (for the time) film-making.

At first it seems unfocused, messy and unreal, but as you follow it carefully it becomes something intriguing and ultimately rewarding. It is one of Gus Van Sant's best movies, along with Drugstore Cowboy and gives us the best performance of late River Phoenix and perhaps also Keanu Reeves.My Own Private Idaho is a haunting ride across the desolate America and the main characters Mike, a drifting narcoleptic, and Scott, a rebellious son of a rich man, are travelers without direction. First they both find a home in a shelter for the homeless and there they make their way by prostitution. Then as they get closer Mike starts a search for his parents who abandoned him as a kid. They locate his father, excellently played by James Russo, who is an alcoholic stuck in a dead end existence, much like his son. Then they set out to find his mother, who is supposed to be in Rome, Italy.It is a very bleak and haunting picture Van Sant paints here and it gives very little hope or satisfaction in the end. Mike doesn't find his mother and returns to Portland alone, while Scott first stays behind in Italy with a woman and later returns to America totally changed. Maybe the trip to Italy straightened him out, maybe he simply realized that he could not or did not want to continue with the old life. So he turns his back on his true friends that sticked up for him when the times were rough and goes back to his father's fortune instead. It is a powerful ending and quite disturbing. Keanu Reeves really does show a potential here. Still the movie is carried by River Phoenix and his most emotional performance in a career that sadly didn't last long.This is one of the best pictures of the 90's and one of the most unique movies Hollywood ever produced. All kudos to Gus Van Sant for this.

The story itself (the search for the mother) never really grips you, though, and the possible gay romance between the two main characters never becomes central, like in for example Brockback Mountain. This does not necessarily means that the film is bad, BUT after half the film has past it looses pace and the search for the mother never manages to drive the film forward. I felt rather bored at times, especially when the film takes place in Italy.So I give it 7/10, because River Pheonix and the beginning are really good, while the middle of the film is bad and certain potentially interesting aspects are never elaborated to the extent that they merit being there in the first place.

Mike, played brilliantly by the late River Pheonix, is a confused young hustler from Idaho traveling through the Pacific northwest trying to find his long lost mother. Yet there is one tiny problem, Mike has narcolepsy and goes into deep sleeps whenever he is under stress.Accompanying Mike is his best friend, Scott, played surprisingly well by Keanu Reeves. Mike is a child of privilege and is wasting his time away selling himself and doing whatever comes his way in the streets of Seattle and Portland trying to past time until his father dies and leave his fortune to him. The friendship between Mike and Scott is as real and genuine as the gay sex scenes in this movie and even though their friendship can get a little close at times it's still as true and American as Thanksgiving.With a plot you don't see everyday, you can imagine the rest of the movie isn't the typical packaged Hollywood product, and it's not. The movie is actually an arcane, modern adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V. It's filled with unforgettable characters, stunning locations, a script that would make Shakespeare proud and some filming that's as rare as a gay boy from Idaho.Two boys on the road trying to find everything besides what they eventually end up with, each other.

There are images from this film that stay with you and the long road is the most poetic one.`I've been on this road before.  This is my road.' Mike (River Phoenix) says early in the film.  The emptiness and loneliness of the wide-open space imprints itself on your memory.  And River Phoenix's heart breaking performance does the same.This is not a story about gay hustlers as much as it is a story about looking for love, acceptance and a place to call home.  It is a film about life, the search for meaning and the roads you choose.River Phoenix is perfect.  You never sense that he is acting.  His vulnerability and pain are raw and intimate.  It's difficult to watch him sometimes but you can't take your eyes off of him.This is not a perfect movie.  The Shakespearean dialogue doesn't work and Keanu Reeves' performance is only slightly less awful than usual.  Anything that takes the viewer away from Mike is a mistake.  Everything else seems forced and artificial by comparison.I've seen little reference to how funny this movie is so let me add that the scene with Hans (Udo Kier) in the hotel room is hysterical.`This road will never end' Mike says in the final scene &#150;`it probably goes all around the world.'

Rightly or wrongly, Keanu Reeves has shared in this blame. I have known River Phoenix types all my life, at once so talented, yet suffering so profoundly that death becomes a longing, consciously or not. And I've known several Mike Waters types too. They have a lot in common, though their talents take them in different directions. The young hustlers of this world must harden, escape, or cease to be. In the case of Mike Waters, the character, River Phoenix, the actor, transcended art when he gave the camera the semblance of the essential being ceasing to exist. Few actors could have pulled it off so convincingly. (This film keeps bringing to mind Shakespearean quotes, but I'll spare you those. As for the essential being ceasing to exist, I can't help but thinking of Jim Morrison's soul-exodus on stage; or River's breakthrough in Silent Tongue. Filmed later, The Thing Called Love gave us an essentially soulless man.)My Own Private Idaho can rip your heart out at times, and change your perceptions of life. How you react will depend on where you are in your journey of life when you watch it. Your perception may change in time; I know mine have.Being a Shakespeare lover, I was amused at the actors attempts during the King Henry IV moments. William Richert alone felt at home. Perhaps this is where Branagh got the idea to cast Keanu in Much Ado About Nothing. (I kept expecting Scott to utter Like, uh, if your leisure served, dude, I would speak with you.) Keanu excels as the heavy in The Gift and is compelling as Siddhartha, as it fits his one-dimensional nature, but he will always be Ted Logan to me.)Back to Idaho. The scene where River, as Mike Waters, falls and crawls on the pavement among broken glass and trash, utterly abandoned, seems to foreshadow future events. (It has been said Johnny Depp scars his skin over important moments in his life. Is there a scar for River Phoenix?)The mere shell of Mike Waters is soon back on that lonely stretch of highway, and we are left with our own conclusions as to his fate. Narcolepsy overtakes him and he falls in the road. A car pulls up, two men get out and rob his prostrate form. They leave and another driver arrives. Because of the locale & the way the driver looks & walks, I choose to believe his brother/father happened upon him and took him home, maybe this time, with love and acceptance. What you choose to believe is just as valid. Only Gus Van Sant knows for sure, and I would not be surprised if even his opinion changed from time to time.

By the mid-80s the independent scene had begun to emerge from its obscure and relatively unknown roots. Directors placed in the indie category had unwittingly given birth to the American new-wave, whereby avant-garde cinema had slyly emerged via the underground film scene. This was paved by art directors, such as Gus Van Sant, who is often mistaken as the pioneer of a non-existent sub-genre Queer Cinema. Such a vague term is regularly misused and does not fit the body of Van Sant's works.Opening with the lonely, untouched Idaho road and emphasising the wide, desolate landscape which swarms Mike, the central protagonist to who the viewer has unwittingly been introduced to. Nothing is masked in a landscape of vast, picturesque beauty. It is in these opening moments that Van Sant instantly captures the notions, motifs, styles and themes of his magnum opus. By using time-lapse photography and exemplified close-ups for key shots Mike's narcoleptic, private Idaho state-of-mind conveys a detached and strained existence. Yet the ambiance could not be more opposed to Mike's looming, inner-torment. His heartbroken, alienated and unrequited soul echoes that of a character built from Shakespearian tragedy. Ironically, (as with many of the story's aspects) this bitter case of &#150;what is essentially- sexual identity is told through a metaphorical, estranged journey, incorporating many pathological and writing elements of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 & 2. Then the streets of Portland are turned into something fuelled by expressionistic, contemporary glances of wry, frisky lyricism.In many respects, My Own Private Idaho is often &#150;rightfully referred to- as a road movie, an observation which is preferably suited for a voyage of poetic exploration and self-fulfilment. It is a tale of repressed desires, held back by the confusion of a living life whereby selling one's body (to men and women) is the only way to survive. Mike is a distant wanderer of the street, forever destined to seek life on the road, as his narcoleptic state-of-mind is an unwanted escape route from his foreseen fate of falling apart from the one he so loves. You see, this is a tale following characters who are suffering from identity crisis, due to the way they have chosen/been forced to make a living.Mike's travelling partner, Scott is more than just a friend, and is in fact the man Mike loves so dearly. During that infamous, often mentioned campfire scene Mike expresses his devotion for Scott by uttering those crucial words, I love you, and you don't pay me. Regrettably, Scott is a selfish man, wallowing in his idealistic dreams of rebellion, whilst still preserving the knowledge that he can return to his roots, inherit a fortune at any time he likes. Unlike his companion, Scott has a family, yet shows no appreciation for such needless things, casting them off for carrying the traits he indulges himself in so dearly. Mike's quest for family and home is stimulated by his repressed desire to receive the love he has always deserved, but never received, and yet it is a mere excuse for Scott to continue his self-righteous journey into oblivion.These so-called low-lives, who have no home or money might be cast-off as hoodlums by many, but Van Sant respects such people, respectfully deciding not to dismiss them. Instead he opts for obtaining an understanding of such people's moral outlook, individual perspective on life and most important of all, the reasoning behind why they subside in a state which is so against the so-called norm. As a thoughtful director, Van Sant examines a situation by not dismissing it as a singular, deluded case of rebellion. By no means is his film a gesture of remorse, but a motion of respectful gratitude. Cultural acceptance requires broad understanding; something Van Sant has an incredible talent for capturing.River Phoenix's famed performance is tough to first grasp, but ranks among the greatest of all-time. It was the true showcase of his long-gone and often reminisced career, sustained by the paradoxically referential characters he portrayed. Phoenix's image of unrequited love is both the cynic's and romantic's most desperate vision. For those who accuse Keanu Reeves of being a wooden actor, observe his chemistry with Phoenix and then tell me he is unable to prove even the slightest hint of aptitude. Both performances are achingly sensitive and longingly receptive, two emotional elements emphasised by the sensually reprehensive screenplay.Some of us get it easy in life, whilst others subconsciously take the long way round. All is not fair in love and war, but My Own Private Idaho offers comfort in the notion of narcoleptic escapism, shimmering street life and those dreamy, forgotten landscapes. This is a sweeping, majestic kind of withdrawn beauty, which clutches the viewer's soul and breaks it into tiny particles of tender humanity. Van Sant proves his auteur status, not only as a master craftsman of direction, but as a storyteller for those unexpected, everyday, tragedy-stricken individuals. A story's route should speak globally; the life-affirming Idaho road achieves such and continues to obtain much, much more. Rarely can art obtain a more emotive and lingering sensation than that of this. "},{"Title":"Bob!","Date":"6 March 2006","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Really, that one word says it all about the film that shows Gus Van Sant knows how to use his actors. Although I have not seen every film with Keanu Reeves in it, I have seen more than I care to admit, and so far, My Own Private Idaho (hereafter referred to as MOPI) is the only one where a scene actually benefits from Reeves' inability to change expression. It is also worth noting that while the makers of Brokeback Mountain attempt to promote their film as innovative for its gay themes, one viewing of MOPI is enough to highlight the fact that Hollywood is still firmly in the habit of recycling itself. While films that depict prostitution, the uglier realities of sexuality, and everyday life have to make an effort to get tired, MOPI manages to stay above the pack with a few twists and turns that keep the mix interesting. It is interesting to speculate on what today's Hollywood would look like had River Phoenix not died outside of a club just as his career was taking off. Would associated actors like Keanu Reeves been able to make as big a splash with his competition? I doubt it.At its heart, MOPI is a tale of a male prostitute with narcolepsy and his attempts to cope with his lot. As Keanu so elegantly puts it, viewers will be amazed that he can exist like this. At some point in the film, Phoenix's character becomes dedicated to finding his mother for purposes that are never completely established. One could call this a road movie, but the straight-up truth is that MOPI does not follow the standard structure of a road movie. Anyone who has sat in a car for more than two hours with persons they find less than enjoyable to be with for five minutes knows the fundamental problem inherent to all road movies. Simply put, they are boring. If riding along the road with people you do not want to be around is purgatory, watching other people do it is normally hell. Not so in MOPI, as Gus Van Sant shifts the focus from what happens on the road (unless it serves a good narrative or comedic purpose) to what happens after our characters get out of their cars.It also helps that Van Sant's film is full of quirky, three-dimensional, well-directed characters. Michael Balzary, or Flea as he is better known, is the kind of actor one has to carefully utilise in order to harness his strengths. He works best when playing an obnoxious man (Back To The Future II for instance) or a weird man. Under Van Sant's direction, he portrays a character that is little different from his past cameos, but somehow attains a rich third dimension. As said earlier, Van Sant also manages to put Keanu's plank-with-a-mean-face act to good use late in the film. The funeral scene in which the hustlers mourn the loss of one of their own while Reeves' character, having turned his back upon them, silently looks on as he is meant to be mourning his father, shows more diversity in two minutes than many supposed cross-cultural films show in two hours. All this scene needed was a cameo from Weird Al Yankovic, and it would be like a drug trip without the drugs.The powerhouse performance in MOPI would be that of William Richert, who plays the hustlers' surrogate father figure, a bloated, humorous man named Bob Pigeon. Unfortunate name aside, he gets many of the best lines in the film, including a comment on 1980s fashion that hovers on the tip of every tongue that was in the heads of those who lived through that august decade. Given that much of the dialogue in this film is based upon Shakespeare, it is a credit both to Van Sant and Richert that MOPI is able to deliver said dialogue to the effect of making me laugh rather than groan in pain. Thanks to MOPI, it does appear halfway believable that a human being ever actually spoke in the manner Shakespeare describes. Shakespeare references aside, Richert's performance helps cement a certain kind of message about loyalty and betrayal. If MOPI had a moral, one might be inclined to believe it is that one should be nice to those you meet on your way up, because you most likely will meet them on your way back down. Granted, we never see Reeves' character on his way down, but the film leaves us eagerly anticipating it.And that, friends and neighbours, is probably the best way I can sum up MOPI. Sure, it does weaken under repeat viewings due to the slow storytelling style, but that first viewing leaves one wanting more rather than less. It is somewhat like taking a trip to a world one has only read about in the pages of TIME magazine or the like, and making it seem almost welcoming. To quote a cartoon I once read in a more low-brow magazine, I half expect the hustlers to look at Reeves' character and say theirs is a world of respect or trust, but ours is not?. It is for that reason, as well as the funeral, that I gave MOPI eight out of ten. It should be seen at least once by everyone.Bob!

Keanu Reeves?! At first glance it seems to be a joke. River Phoenix in the lead role? A film using classical dialogue set in modern day dealing with prostitution, bisexuality, homosexuality, heterosexuality, drugs, violence, and sex? But it's more than just that. At its core My Own Private Idaho is a soft and delicate examination of a young man who doesn't have a place in life and is trying to find his way along the beaten path; the road that stretches continually onwards, never ending. I've been here before, Mike (Phoenix) says to Scott Favor (Reeves). He's speaking of the road before them. He isn't speaking literally, of course. But he's been there spiritually and mentally before. He knows he'll see it again, too.Gus Vant Sant was close to the material and based the characters on real men he knew in Portland, Oregon. Van Sant is a homosexual and perhaps that is why the subject matter -- fairly risqu√© and controversial even by today's standards -- was handled with such care, never seeming exploitative, but rather crucial and caring. It's a testament to the film's universal appeal that it was critically _and_ publicly praised on release and, at least to my knowledge, did not create the wave of controversy that it easily could have. (After all, it's a mainstream production centered around bisexual and homosexual street hustlers, and features on-screen orgasms and explicit -- or at least seemingly explicit -- freeze-frame sex scenes. After all, just remember the uproar Midnight Cowboy caused when it came out.) What I remember most fondly about My Own Private Idaho is its truly beautiful photography and direction. The cinematography is one of the best examples of truly stunning visuals I've ever seen. The touching musical score only complements the outer layer.I won't lie This film will not appeal to everyone. It is quite experimental and could understandably be criticized for its lengthy middle, which awkwardly transforms into a Shakespeare spin-off, and then -- in its last act -- returns to reality and abandons the stiff dialogue.Still, in my opinion, the Shakespeare elements are fairly important to the story and don't really harm it at all. The story, when stripped of its outer layers, is really just a tender story about the rites of passage of a young man. And love. Something we can all relate to, if we take away the specifics of the situation.River Phoenix is extraordinary in the lead role and in my opinion, My Own Private Idaho solidified his impressive talents as one of the generation's best young actors.

It's basically a depressing and bitter road movie about two gay or bisexual male prostitutes on a road trip. Because they both have mother and father issues that they have to deal with. I give River Phoenix's character some sympathy but not so much for Keanu's character. Maybe because one is more in a rut than the other. And none of the characters are likable in this movie, which is fine since when it comes to the tragedy. It didn't get all that depressing.

As much as I wanted to see it, I realized I had to wait till it was on a movie channel, unfortunately. Last night when I was flipping through channels late, I spotted it and knew I had to watch it. I had high expectations for it, and I have to say I was a little disappointed, but I still thought it was a pretty great film. I mean, I really love independent films with strong performances, and for me, the late great River Phoenix's performance as Mike Waters in this made the movie for me, along with some great writing, music and directing from Van Sant.The film follows Mike Waters (River Phoenix), a young dumb broke male hustler who's trying to get through life and feed his slight drug addiction hooking with mostly men. Mike struggles with narcelepsy, and throughout the entire movie Mike keeps drifting off into unconsciousness when any stress is brought upon him. During Mike's harsh and dark journey through his so-called life on the streets, he meets another male hustler, Scott (Keanu Reeves) who's the runaway son of a wealthy and powerful senator. Mike and Scott become fast friends, and later on get mixed up in a band of other young gay male prostitutes led by Bob Pigeon (William Richert), an older gentleman who is kind of like a father to the boys in some kind of twisted and perverted way. The two (Mike and Scott) go on adventures together, and try to track down Mike's estranged mother when Mike finds out she's still alive from his could-be birth father, Richard Waters (played by James Russo). Scott and Mike's search for Mike's mom eventually leads them to Rome, where Scott falls in love with a beautiful Italian girl, Carmella (Chiara Casselli), which later encourages Scott to clean up his act, re-unite with his father, and inherit a fortune. Gus Van Sant's screenplay is loosely based on Shakespeare's historical production of Henry IV, and there are some scenes in the film that produce strong Shakespearian qualities along with dialogue, that I found enjoyable but kind of distracting from the story.The finest quality of Van Sant's modern adaptation of Henry IV, 'My Own Private Idaho', is without a doubt the acting. Like I said before, the best performance by a longshot of the film is River Phoenix's haunting and empowering one. This is without a doubt the tragically short-lifed River Phoenix's very best screen performance, and it almost shocks me he wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award for it. Phoenix achieves perfection in his role, really making you not only sympathize with his character, but understand him and his actions to some degree. A lot of critics raved about River Phoenix in this, and they should have. Keanu Reeves' acting however, is a different story. Reeves is such a poor performer in anything he is, but he really pisses on the movie (to put it so cruel) as much as he can. I really didn't expect anything more then a horrible performance from Keanu, but I was disappointed he was cast in such a pivotal and important role, that requires an actor with a lot of range. River Phoenix more then outshines Keanu Reeves in every scene in the film, even when Phoenix's character is asleep from his narcelepsy. William Richert does a fine job as Bob (the leader of the young hustlers/thieves/drug addicts, that kind of resembles the character of Fagin in Oliver Twist). James Russo is dazzling in the very short screen time he has, and German actor Udo Kier, is interesting as one of Mike and Scott's highly neurotic and creepy clients who puts on a musical dance for them using hotel lamps that has to be one of the most out-there film scenes since Dean Stockwell and Dennis Hopper's duet of 'In Dreams' in 1984's 'Blue Velvet'. I have to say I wasn't too impressed with Italian actress Chiara Casselli's performance in this, and although she was nice to look at, she really didn't pull it off for me. The film's music and cinematography is first-rate, and Gus Van Sant's screenplay is terrific. Van Sant does a excellent job directing as well. Van Sant really does a meticolous and careful job bringing this risqu√© and unsettling, yet poignant and beautifully crafted Shakespearian based tale about the friendship and hardship of two young male hustlers in Portland on a mission to find themselves.In closing, I didn't find 'My Own Private Idaho' to be as magnificent as I had hoped, but I really did find it insightful and a work of art. The film is enjoyable sometimes, but at times it's very dark and disturbing and kind of makes you uncomfortable. That's not said to take away anything from this extraordinary motion picture, because the film has to be unsettling because the story and whole point of the movie is unsettling and upsetting. I recommend 'My Own Private Idaho' to people who appreciate the art of film, and don't get disturbed or unsettled easy.

Today, I watched it for the first time since, mainly because it is featured heavily in my dissertation and I can not really find much to criticise. In my (humble) opinion, the relationship between Mike and Scott is reminiscent of that of John Voight's and Dustin Hoffman's characters in Midnight COwboy. There is a real screen chemistry that makes Mike's feelings towards Scott even more poignant. I have to agree with many of the other users comments that the campfire scene was beautifully written and touching in its simplicity. I also admire Van Sant's bravery. Few directors would tackle homosexuality in their films for fear of alienating audiences at such a time and equally, few actors would take the roles. Admittedly, this film is not about homosexuality per se, but the undertones create such tragically compelling relationships..Firstly, Mike is abandoned by Scott who also then goes on to break Bob's heart. MOPI displays some remarkable acting and it goes without saying really that River Phoenix's performance stands way above those of the impressive supporting cast. It is amazingly real and is so emotive that it makes you want to go and watch everything else he ever did.Although everyone is entitled to their opinions on any film, i really think people should give it a chance, rather than dismiss it after ten minutes.It is not a commercial or mainstream film..it is something better than that and actually makes you think. Give it a while and you too will find yourself drawn in to the lives of the characters. MOPI now has a place in my top three films of all time just ahead of #2, Dancer In The Dark.

Keanu Reeves, once again, someone who I always thought couldn't have talent if it hit him in the face actually pulls in a decent performance and carries this film well with River. Their chemistry is pretty on key with each other throughout the film and River's performance was definitely memorable. The way this film told the story was also unique and interesting, this isn't your typical drama, it has an independent movie feel and pulls itself together very well with some clever editing and great performances.Mike is a young man who is looking for his mother, he is searching all over Portland, he makes his means by selling his body to women and men. His upper class friend, Scott, decides to help him out with finding his mother, but Scott has sworn that he will one day reject his rebellious ways towards his father. Mike falls in love with Scott, but Scott doesn't respond and ends up finding another woman on their trip that takes them as far as to Italy to find Mike's mother. Scott finally feels like it's time to grow up and move on, but Mike will not give up on his strange lifestyle.My Own Private Idaho wasn't what I expected, it was a lot stranger than what I was looking for. I thought it was just supposed to be like an American Beauty in the drama sense, but instead, it's made like a poem, also it's presented beautifully. I really did feel sad watching River though, his performance is so wonderful and it was such a tragic turn that he had to leave this Earth so early, his talent shined in My Own Private Idaho. I do recommend it for the drama lovers, but it's definitely an acquired taste, as much as I enjoyed it, this is not a film I could really watch again to be honest.7/10 "}{"Title":"Interesting movie with narrow appeal, not mainstream.","Date":"27 June 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" My wife is one to tell it like it is, and when My Own Private Idaho ended, she simply said strange movie.

Keanu Reeves 26, is Scott Favor, son of a wealthy politician, and about to turn 21. They are friends, but totally different. Mike really is gay and a confused person, while Scott is straight, and is simply rebelling against his father. The bulk of the movie is Mike's quest, aided by Scott, to find his mother who had left home when Mike was very young. There are lots of scenes of the highway, and Mt Hood recognizable in Oregon, not Idaho.SPOILERS. Mike and Scott head to Italy to find mom, after hearing she had moved there. (Never mind that they probably had no money, nor passports.) She had been there, but was gone back to the USA. Scott had time to meet and fall in love with a pretty, young Italian farm girl, and stayed when Mike left to go back to the States. Back home, Mike confronted his older brother, who it turns out was really his father also. Scott comes back with his new bride, turning 21 throws off his street life and assumes his position in the family after his father dies. Life goes on for Mike and for Scott, in two different directions.The final scene is Biblical. Mike falls asleep on the highway, two men in a car come along, rob him, and leave him for dead.

He is working on the acting but until Keanu understands he must let go of himself when he acts then he will continue to worry his fans and critics. He seems to do best in nonleading roles probably because he feels he won't be noticed. Keanu's notoriety seems to be a double edged sword for him. For example, it seemed to me when he was unknown many of my friends and even critics thought he had talent and potential to be a great actor. But after the Bill and Ted fiasco and everyone knew him in the mainstream it seems the critics and everyone else started calling him a horrible actor.

Shame about the brutal acting all round (except for River)","Date":"14 January 2009","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The independent cinema of Gus Van Sant is always worth a look. Some of his stuff is some of the most interesting stuff to come out of the States in the last twenty years. This is, in fact, one of his best known films, and although this is a Hollywood film, Van Sant insisted that some elements of independent film-making would be used. This was always going to be allowed after a film like Drugstore Cowboy, and with the theme of young male prostitution.This could have very easily turned into exploitation, but Van Sant treats this plot with poetic regard. He's very soft handed, even in showing the crudest sex scenes, particularly in the ones where he uses the still shots, a very interesting way of showing sex scenes, that reminds us of Le Jetee by Chris Marker. The acting does let the film down a little bit. River Phoenix is great. He is exactly what Van Sant wanted, with the muttering way of speaking lines, and acting the adult child part made to do grown up things very well. It's the rest of the cast that is close to terrible. Keanu Reeves' performance is brutal. Watching his recite lines taken straight from Shakespeare makes you want to slap his face repeatedly. But this time, he is hardly helped by everyone else in the cast, among whom only Udo Kier can save himself as the German 'perv'.The storyline was largely inspired by other classic works of literature. Scott's plot was notoriously inspired by Henry IV by Shakespeare, in fact they are practically the same storyline. But as well as that, we can notice and admire a strange similarity to Chimes at Midnight and Oliver Twist.There are lots of interesting aspects to the story. The friendship between Mike and Scott, even when we know Mike loves Scott because he is homosexual, is for example really interesting, as would have been Scott's relationship with Bob, hadn't Reeves' and Richert's acting been so brutal. So, within the film, the interesting aspect that turns out to be good lies all within Mike and his problems, past and present. And, as well as that, his character and Phoenix himself, who makes the fact he is narcoleptic look cool.

Van Sant had written, directed and produced a number of films before this one; his experience evident in the films direction. Starring River Phoenix as Mike Waters and Keanu Reeves as Scotty Favor, van Sant received the best performance out of Phoenix, who's portrayal of the narcoleptic street hustler, Mike Waters, was inspired. Reeves' performance was not as powerful, yet van Sant seems to have gotten a much better performance out of him than most directors he had previously worked with. The film's writing included many excerpts from Shakespeare, and much of the dialog between the characters was untraditional, often sounding more like Victorian or Elizabethan English; which lends a slightly abstract sort of feeling to the film. Van Sant's grasp of the reality of the lives of gay street hustlers in fairly strong, a theme he has carried out in later projects in his career, such as Speedway Junky, which he produced in 1999. The direction of the film, its characters, its dialog and story were, for its time very original; and a dangerous undertaking by van Sant, who could have easily effected his career for the worse in making this film. The project however turned out to be a fairly incredible film, with a unique yet universal love story wrapped up in a world of street hustling, which lends a grittiness to the film and its story, which makes it great.Van Sant takes us along a journey through a period of Mikey's life, and Phoenix's portrayal of the character is beautifully acted, and engaging in a way that only Phoenix could be. An old traditional type of story, the love story, is brilliantly told in a refreshingly untraditional way, with unique characters in offbeat settings. The old story 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl' is given a new face with this film, and this face-lift is flawlessly applied by Gus van Sant with his creative and artistic direction and brilliantly quirky writing. The tone of the film, is both bleak and expressive, with many of the scenes taking place among damp and gray backgrounds and empty baron spaces, which all lend to the overall serious nature of the subject matter while not distracting from the story. This film is a refreshing change from the everyday hopeless love story; in which the characters are strongly played and the brief scenes, which expose the lifestyles of the people involved, are explicit without being a turn off to the audience. Van Sant strikes a good balance between the touchy subject matter and the touching and revealing story, which he hopes to convey to his viewers. I would recommend this film for it's artistry alone, and compound that recommendation based on the strength of its story and brilliance of it's combination of witty and unconventional dialog.

His closest friend on the street is River Phoenix, a narcoleptic prostitute who dreams of finding security by reconnecting with his trailer-park-trash mother. Together the two go off on a road-trip spree complete with a Falstaff figure and interspersed with takes on other teenage boys plying their bodies on the street in order to survive.Reeves gives one of his better performances here and the supporting cast is very good, but the heart of the film belongs to River Phoenix, who works miracles with the pathos of his role. It is largely due to his performance that the film is able to hold our attention. But the adoption of Shakespeare's lines, particularly since the film skips in and out of them from portion to portion of the film, seems extremely out of place, and the film as a whole never seems to find a cohesive visual style. Worse still, one is never entirely certain what point Van Sant is trying to make, and the uncertainty doesn't seem intentional on the director's part.

What I got was in fact one of my favourite films, and certainly one of the most under-rated American independent films in recent history.My Own Private Idaho has a kind of grimy transcendentalism that almost touches wong-kar-wai territory.  The camera swaggers and frames with a touch that the cameraman must have been born with- the exposure always beautiful. Top marks to the DOP.  Another revelation is the dialogue- sometimes playing on the Shakespearian themes that riddle the plot- itself sometimes works its way into a psuedo Shakespearian grandeur (look at the scenes with Bob in them).  Another touch is the acting- fantastic performances from all concerned especially as it has been noted before River P.  But lets not forget Reeves here- he also plays a fantastic part.But please, regardless of what I have just said- please do not expect much (as I did not) and then you may emerge from the viewing amazed and glad that you had dedicated your time to this gifted film-maker (like I did).

Basically, in Portland, Oregon, narcolepsy suffering Mike Waters (River Phoenix) and son of a rich father Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves) are two male prostitutes living on the streets. They take drugs and sell their bodies to women and men, but their personal lives come in to play a lot, with Mike being the quiet gay seeking his long lost mother, and Scott saying he's straight and only shying away from his rich lifestyle temporarily. They are travelling all over the place to find Mike's mother, Portland to Idaho, Italy and a few other places, the narcolepsy obviously is a problem as Mike will not remember anything, but Scott finds love with Carmella (Chiara Caselli). Even though the mother was not found the journey was more a self discovery experience, and in the end Scott returns to his true lifestyle, and Mike just falls asleep on the highway in Idaho. Also starring William Richert as Bob Pigeon, Rodney Harvey as Gary, Michael Parker as Digger, Jessie Thomas as Denise, Grace Zabriskie as Alena and Ace Ventura Pet Detective's Udo Kier as Hans. Phoenix is quite compelling in one of his last roles before his death two years later from a drugs overdose (he was of the live fast die young breed), and Reeves is pretty good as well.

With the help of the greatest writer in the English language ever, William Shakespeare, Gus Van Sant draws two great characterizations in the characters realized by River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves.You couldn't find two more opposite types in the world. River is a street kid through and through. Even the circumstances of his birth are a tragedy that I won't reveal. His mother leaves him as a youngster and he can't get over it and go on. He was raised by an older brother in the sparsely populated 'potato state' as he calls Idaho and the and the family dynamic was strained. He's a gay kid in an area where that could be deadly so he takes off for the fleshpots of Seattle and Portland where his youth and beauty will bring him some cash. He has no skills or education to support himself any other way. Sad, but the only hope this kid has of a decent life is to get taken up by some older sugar daddy who might just treat him to an education of some kind. That is if he can decide to just get over a bad home life and lack of a normal family. I've known gay kids who came from as lousy a background as River Phoenix and who never could get over it. River has developed an interesting defense mechanism and a psychologist would have field day with him if he got him on the coach. When the stress gets too much for him he just has a seizure like an epileptic, but in fact all he does is fall asleep. It's called narcilepsy, but he's vulnerable in that state as the film shows as well. River just tunes out the world. Keanu comes from a different world, his father is the Mayor of Portland, but he's dying and hopes to have his son take over the family political dynasty. But Tom Troupe is bitterly disappointed in his 'effeminate' son who like Prince Hal likes to hang out with lowlifes and street trash. Keanu's Falstaff is William Richert, a gay older man of a Falstaffian bloated belly who likes the young stuff and in his world probably treats them well. Gus Van Sant was quite imaginative in seeing the gay subtext that could be drawn from Prince Hal and Falstaff. Indeed Keanu says that Richert is closer to him than his real father. But he also says that he's planning to work a change in him when he comes into his own. And he says it in dialog taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV Parts one and two.The most touching scene is with River and Keanu out in the country at a fire where River basically confesses his love for him. It's love to be sure, but River also sees in Keanu a figure who has confidence and self assurance and those are the qualities that draws him to Reeves. What Phoenix misreads is that self confidence is really a safety net that he knows he has and at the appropriate time uses. Although he's gay for pay as he states, he still allows River to have sex with him. I suspect that Gus Van Sant from his own background knows full well that gay for pay is not always 100% absolute.Reeves goes on to his destiny for which if you know your Shakespeare know what that is. Phoenix's destiny is less clear, more than likely an oblivion that a lot of those kids go to. As a fantasy I'd like to think that as Reeves denies himself, closets himself as he moves on in life, that an older River comes back to remind him of his roots.We all know of the tragedy of River Phoenix who died way too young just like a lot of street kids do ironically. There is a second tragedy in the My Own Private Idaho. Rodney Harvey who played one of River and Keanu's street peers also died way too young in similar circumstances to Phoenix. Not only does Van Sant give us an excellent two person character study, but his other character with less dialog than the leads also are fully formed characters which is the mark that many including me say indicates a great film. My Own Private Idaho is a troubling picture, but a realistic one of the underside of gay life that we cannot ignore.

Those people are no longer my friends.  What can I say?  This movie was crap.  I had respect for the late Mr. Phoenix, but that is fading away.  The still sex scenes did nothing to add to this movie.  Although, you did feel really bad when his lover left him for a girl.  His life keeps going downhill and taking the movie with him.  Nothing like finding out your dad is your brother.  Give me a break, not this movie.  Leave it be. "}]
