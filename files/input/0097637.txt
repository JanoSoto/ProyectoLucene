The film is at least nice to watch, the soundtrack is decent, the direction is good and the script does have a few laughs that makes the experience enjoyable. And the acting is very spirited- Jerry-Lee is the star of the show, very well trained and cute, while James Belushi is always watchable and Mel Harris is appealing and sexy.Overall, this is a surprisingly good buddy movie with enough humorous moments and spirited performances to make it worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"An great buddy flick about an man and his new found friend... a dog.","Date":"4 September 2008","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Narcotics Cop Thomas Dooley(James Belushi) is an unusual off-beat person... who loves to work alone. One day, his boss (Cotther Smith) wants Dooley find an new partner. He decides to use an K-9 named Jerry Lee (Koton), who has the best nose for the drug-busting business. At first, Dooley and Jerry Lee don't get along until they share a few things in common. At the same time, Dooley does his best with his love life (Mel Harris) and trying to bust a prominent socialite (Kevin Tighe). Thomas and his new partner are in for a wild ride.Directed by Rod Daniel (Beethoven's 2nd, Like Father Like Son, Teen Wolf) made an enjoyable if silly cop between an relationship with a man and a dog. Belushi and especially Koton are good in the film. There's some hilarious moments, which this movie is aimed at kids but there's some violent scenes as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an good Dolby Surround 2.0 Sound. DVD features are basically like the original theatrical trailer and cast & filmmakers' bios. K-9 was an surprise box office hit. But the relationship between a man and a dog came out months earlier in 1989, which it has some of the same premise titled Turner & Hooch. But i feel that K-9 is the better film than the other one. But that's up to the viewer to decide. There's some familiar faces in K-9 in bit parts like Ed O'Neill, Alan Blumenfeld, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Dan Castellaneta (Best Known as the voice of Homer Simpson on The Simpsons) and William Salder. K-9 was so popular on video, there was two Direct to Video movies produced... starring James Belushi. K-9 is a good cop comedy with some genuine laughs. Worth seeing. (****/*****).

Personally, I found Turner and Hooch to be superior to this work, but it is still enjoyable, and comes in second to my favorite.HOwever, this is witty, and funny enough to be endearing, without resorting to Jim Belushi's usual tactics, although he does employ the beginning of those posturing and chest-beating tactics here. But they are not so dominant that the movie suffers. In fact, they play well in this situation, though it IS sad to watch a grown man who is romantically jealous of a dog.This fails any Oscar possibilities, but I do not honestly believe that would surprise those involved with this work. The bottom line This is a fun movie. It fails to warm the heart as well as Turner and Hooch, but does not make you feel sorry for the dog like some other movies have, along this venue. It is entertaining and fun, and rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend .

Take the element of the dog away, and you pretty much have a dog of a story though. It's basically the buddy cop movie with a twist, and thanks to Belushi being quite likable, the film manages to be funny whenever the dog is off screen.Support is okay, but it looks like they are just letting the two get on with it.It's harmless stuff, one of those movies you will find on TV one Sunday afternoon, and still be able to enjoy it through rose tinted specs.Still miles better than Turner and Hooch.

No one on the police force what's to be his partner in that he, with his mindless and not too bright actions, might very well get them killed. Forced to have police dog Jerry Lee as his partner Dooley feels a bit humiliated in playing second fiddle to a pooch. It's Terry Lee who in fact is the best and most effective member of the trio in saving Dooley's behind at least half a dozen times in the movie with whet seem like the not too in-tuned Dooley even noticing it.Dooley for his part is stuck up on his live in girl fried Tracy, Mel Harris, who for some strange reason doesn't dump him who's in fact leaching off her by making himself at home in her sea side house and stuffing himself with all the food and drinks in her fridge and liqueur cabinet. ***SPOILERS*** It's in Officer Dooley's attempts to get big time San Diago drug dealer Layman,Kevin Tighe, with the goods on him,the 50 million in cocaine, that not only has Tracy kidnapped and held as hostage by Laymen's hoods but has his partner Jerry Lee end up taking a bullet for him! It that act of bravery and courage on Jerry Lee's part that finally convinced Dooley what a first class jerk he was in always treating his partner all throughout the movie as unfeeling and shabbily as he did.It's really Konton as police dog Jerry Lee who steals the movie in showing the audience just how valuable he was to his at first not so applicative human partner Officer Mike Dooley. It was during the movie that Dooley started to see what a great partner and friend Jerry Lee really was to him but only when it was almost too late for him to notice it. It took a a bullet in the chest on Jerry Lee's part that had his partner Officer Dooley finally realized how wrong he was in treating his police dog partner who did everything he could,like saving his life a number of times, to have him accept him as an equal. It was towards the end of the movie with Jerry Lee bleeding to death for a gun shot wound that a tearful Officer Mike Dooley gave him his most heart felt compliment. Dooley is having the gravely wounded Jerry Lee refused treatment at the local hospital because he's an animal not a human had him tell the by the books doctor, David Haskell, in charge of the emergency room He's not a dog he's a cop and he's my partner! Sure enough that was enough to get Jerry Lee admitted as well as ending up saving his life.P.S Even though Jerry Lee or Konton who played him survived his injuries in the movie K-9 in real life he wasn't so lucky. Konto was killed in the line of duty on November 18, 1991 trying to apprehend and capture a fugitive cop killer in Kansas City.

Not sure if there was a third movie to complete the set so that it would be like the trio set of films such as the underwater trio of The Abyss, Leviathan, and Deepstar Six. These two films basically had cops who were not dog lovers getting partnered up with a new canine pup. In the case of Tuner and Hooch it was a matter of Hanks character kind of inheriting the dog from the owner killed by some bad guys and Hanks thinks the dog can i.d. the killer. Here it is a bit more realistic as Jim Belushi needs a drug sniffing dog so he kind of gets stuck with one of the worst on the force. I enjoy this one better than the Hanks' one, but both have some rather humorous moments and both did fairly well for movies back in the 80's as this one made 42 million and Hooch made 72 million. I see from the scores though that they are not highly revered movies, but like I said I thought they both were good. This one just worked a bit better for me. I am not saying Belushi is a better actor than Hanks, far from it, but I liked his character a bit more than the one Hanks portrayed. I also think German Shepards are one of the best breed of big dog so that is probably why I am biased against the other one a bit. This one also had a much funnier ending than did that one. What makes this one though is the interplay between Belushi's character and the crazy canine, Jerry Lee, I think its name was as they try to stop some drug guys.

Determined to finally get his man, Dooley enlists the help of a police dog called Jerry Lee The Killer to hopefully sniff out the drugs that he knows Lyman is involved in. Trouble is is that Dooley has no idea how to treat a dog and Jerry Lee is more of a maverick cop than he is!Given its low rating, it's hard to know what sort of film the critics and general movie watching public were expecting with this one. Since a buddy buddy cop movie staring James Belushi and a German Shepherd Dog doesn't say anything other than the film we actually get. By the time of K-9s release it was evident what sort of film would Belushi's staple money earner, the kind that called for him to play the cocky quipper with a glint in his eye. Belushi would try to abandon his buffoonery roles post Curly Sue who could blame him after that mess really?, and attempt to be a more dramatic, action type actor. It wouldn't work, his excellent performances in Oliver Stone's Salvador and The Principal the latter also criminally undervalued were long behind him. So you hear the name James Belushi in relation to films and you by and large think larking about action comedy. Coming a year after Red Heat it looks like Belushi is wearing the same suit from that film in this one!, K-9 delivers exactly what it screamed out it would from the off.Technically the film has very few things to recommend, but as a family friendly action comedy it has much to laud. The interplay between man and dog is great fun, they are both members of the animal kingdom, they both got needs and they are both great cops. Yes we are never in any doubt that after a troubled start, this pairing are going to become firm friends, and that ultimately, by hook, crook and paw, they will get the job done. Belushi has a nice line in facial comedy and he also never comes up short in delivering quips with panache, and a confidence that often belies the trouble his characters are often in. The dog too is hilarious hats of to animal handler Robert Zides. Courtesy of writers Steven Siegel & Scott Myers, this is a dog that eats chili and wants to vie with Dooley for Tracy's affections Mel Harris as Dooley's frustrated girlfriend. It makes for a number of funny set-ups that both man and beast revel at being involved in. Kevin Tighe as villain Lyman is a touch under written, and the obligatory emotional heart tugger moment now looks like over egging the formula pudding. But this is harmless witty fun that gets in and does its job without proclaiming to be anything other than what it is. 7/10 "},{"Title":"THis is one of the funniest movies I ever seen","Date":"23 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" This movie is all about the usual hardboiled detective stereotype as well as a dog with a similar personalty (as well as a sadistically hilarious habit of biting anyone he doesn't like in the groin.)

My favorite parts include, Jerry Lee (the dogs name) sneaking into the bed while poor Jim Belushi is trying to get some and when he gets into the limo and screws the rich guys dog while lets get it on is being played, because its like the dog is telling Jim I can do it but you can't nyah nyah But Jim gets even when he runs the dog through the car wash without the roof because he refused to take a bath. I also like what happens at the end where we see a sad moment where Jim thought the dog was dying in the vet office and he sadly tells him how he really feels about him being a good friend and what not. it turns out old jerry lee was playing possum.

Yes, it has its faults; it is predictable and at times, over simplistic, yet it held my attention from beginning to end.This is one of those movies that exceeds the sum of it's parts. Although out shadowed by Turner and Hooch, this movie delivers so much more in the way of laughs and down to earth fun. Unlike Tom Hanks's character; Dooley is not perfect; his faults are many yet he is a likable character. There's no blossoming love interest, he's already happily married, and he really isn't searching for anything within his life. Dooley is a man who knows where his life is, and although this may not be where he wants to be, he is happy.And Jerry Lee? Well anyone familiar with German Shepherd dogs will identify with this movie. Whether intentional or not, this movie captures the fun loving and at times mischievous persona of these dogs, which is in stark contrast to the role often found for German Shepherds on TV and in the movies. This is without a doubt my favourite doggy caper ever. It's not a perfect movie and most people will see it's many faults yet it is fun. And far from the usual scruffy mutt and lovable kid movie it's a kids movie made for adults and this is why it works. Some will love it, others will hate it, yet if you ignore the dated looks and predictability I'm sure enjoyment will ensue; therefore, just sit back with some friends and enjoy what is still a great movie.

It is hilarious and is one of the only movies that I can watch repeatedly.  I think the reason for this is all the little jokes that you don't necessarily catch the first time.  James Belushi has a habit of talking under his breath or speaking quickly and it's these little gems that often go wasted if you are not paying complete attention.  Thus, every time I see it I catch a new joke.I've now held a grudge against Tom Hanks and Turner and Hooch for over ten years because they completely ripped off K-9 in so many ways yet it undeservedly became a bigger hit.

The two dislike each other immediately but put things aside to try and catch the criminal.  However, the closer they get the higher the stakes become and it soon becomes very personal for Dooley.Anyone expecting a life changing experience from this movie will be really disappointed (as well as a little soft in the head!).  This is just plain vegging material &#150; as proof I watched it on Sunday lunchtime to relax and not think!  So taken this into consideration, it isn't that bad a film, it is just very stereotyped and unimaginative.  The `mismatched partner' cliché is wheeled out yet again and it does feel a little forced.  It gives rise to the odd laugh but not very many, nor does it manage to really get the heart racing as it has action, but no real tension or excitement.The guns, language and hints of violence make this unsuitable for kids but I don't know who else would happily watch this and accept it as entertainment?  I watched it without any effort and found it `ok' but not much more than that, I wouldn't watch it again but it passed 90 minutes for me.  But, if you're expecting to be able to get more than that from it then I'd give it a pass.Belushi is actually quite good in the lead when you consider that he has to carry the whole film himself.  He is mostly onscreen with the dog and he does well to hold the attention &#150; he's not hilarious but he has enough energy to cover the gaps.  Of the support cast, Tighe does OK as the baddie of the piece but other than that the only other person who really stood out was a pre-fame William Sadler as a car salesman, (although it was funny to see Mel Harris outside of her thirtysomething role!)Overall this is OK as brain dead entertainment.  It sticks to cliché all the way through and you can easily see the gags coming from a mile away, even though they aren't that funny.  If you just want to waste 90 minutes like I did then this is OK for an undemanding audience, however it isn't funny or exciting or involving enough to be considered worthwhile viewing in my opinion.

I do really doubt that a simple machine gun will cause a car to blow up. I think that it will more likely riddle it with holes and leak petrol everywhere.K-9 is about a cop with a attitude. He is on the trail of a drug lord who is smuggling drugs through Los Angeles. This is the typical cop movie where the drug smuggler is an ultra-rich millionaire and also very untouchable, and even an idol to the community. Dooley (James Belushi) is simply a cop with a very bad attitude and simply has a problem with the human race. This is why I find it strange that he has a girlfriend, and in reality downright unrealistic. At the beginning of the movie he is having a row with her, and honestly he doesn't even seem to want to make it work out, and when things start to fall apart, it is not his fault. Seriously, Dooley really needs to open his eyes and look at himself.He doesn't want to work with a human, but realises that he needs a dog to find some drugs in a warehouse, so he helps out a friend by catching two gunmen, after ramming a very expensive car which he hired using somebody else's credit card, through the front of a house. And the car rental guy lets him get away with it &#x96; he was asking to loose that car. Anyway, He gets the dog and the dog turns out to be a lemon. He searches the warehouse only to find a guy smoking a joint, while Dooley is becoming the laughing stock of the warehouse workers.Now the dog is good, a little too human in parts, but good. I love German Shepherds, they are just the most beautiful dogs, so that is why I liked this movie. If it wasn't for the dog then there wouldn't have been much to make this movie. The dog has its quirks, which makes it interesting. If the dog didn't have a mind of its own, nor acted like a human, then this movie would have been nothing. It is only that the dog with an attitude gets stuck with a cop with an attitude that this movie rises above garbage.

Remember Dante's Peak going up against Volcano or how about Antz taking on A Bug's Life? Well, here is the natural opponent to Turner & Hooch except that there are one or two other issues to contend with. First of all, Tom Hanks has been replaced with James Belushi, the ugly dog is now a much-more photogenic German Shepard and the laughs have nearly all dried up - not that Turner & Hooch had many to begin with.Belushi plays hot-shot cop Dooley, obsessed with bringing down suspected crime boss Lyman (Kevin Tighe) to such a point that his girlfriend Tracy (Mel Harris) is considering kicking him out of her apartment. Determined to bring Lyman down, Dooley finds himself partnered with Jerry Lee, an eccentric police dog with a strong sense of personality. Unfortunately, Jerry Lee has a far greater impact on Dooley's personal life and before long, Lyman has gained the upper hand. Can Dooley and Jerry Lee overcome their differences and bring him down or will Lyman have the last laugh? Given that Belushi spends, I guess, maybe 70% of this movie talking to a dog, your enjoyment of K-9 will largely depend on how funny you find Belushi. Personally, he's just about as unfunny as Hanks was in Turner & Hooch but like Turner & Hooch, the dog is the true star. He has the best scenes and gets the most laughs but the film-makers make the same mistake of making the dog act like a human - no dog I've ever met covers their face with embarrassment! The other let-down is the plot which is not only predictable but also so closely matches Turner & Hooch that I'm surprised there wasn't a law-suit. It's a fact that this was released a few short months before Turner & Hooch but it feels like an odd kiddie's film - having the whole drug-plot run alongside the comic chaos of an out-of-control dog working with an unconventional cop felt like a difficult marriage, especially when played for laughs as it is here.It's never easy to compare two films so closely matched together but I'm afraid that K-9 comes off a close second to Turner & Hooch. It's not as funny, the dog doesn't appeal in the same way as the mutt in the other film and Belushi is a poor man's Hanks. It can't decide whether it wants to be a serious cop story or a straight-up comedy with a angry dog wrecking havoc but in the end, it became neither. The only real difference between the two is that the love interest in K-9 is much hotter and there is no cop partner for Belushi to spark off, meaning he spends most of the film talking to a dog. And if that's what you want to spend 100-ish minutes watching then this is the film for you. Personally, I can't recommend it so for my money, the whole cop-with-a-dog sub-genre should be put to rest for a long time to come. Here's hoping.

Jim Belushi carries the film on his own and his comic performance is wonderful. Of course we musn't forget Jerry Lee, who really is an exceptional dog, in real life too. The humor is witty and so over-the-top that it becomes good again. It's one of those films that's simply impossible not to love ( like Men In Black).I feel great every time I watch this movie and I never miss it when it's on TV. It's highly recommended for everyone, though I think mostly males will enjoy this.8/10 "},{"Title":"Much better!","Date":"17 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" I watched K-911 first before this movie, I didn't realize that it was a sequel. Not to mention, not a very good one at that. Jim wasn't doing a good job convincing me that he was just as good of a comedian as his brother, he isn't still, but this movie showed a little better of what talent he could have. K-9 was more fun than the sequel, I can tell you that much, because it revolved better around the story.This story shows how Dooley met his K-9 partner, Jerry Lee. As stereotypical as it sounds, Dooley is your typical stands by his own crazy rules type of a cop, he also refuses to get a partner, but eventually decides the best way to do it is to get a cop dog. Figures that the dog would be easier to command and he'd be in charge. He is also trying to bust a drug run and his girlfriend gets involved, unintentionally. He finds out that Jerry Lee proves himself more useful than Dooley takes him for.Over all, I'd say this is a fun little movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon. It has some fun humor and cute moments where you just automatically fall in love with Jerry Lee, I guess Dooley isn't such a bad guy after all. Believe me when I say to skip the sequel and stick to K-9.6/10 "}{"Title":"Insert Dog pun here...","Date":"8 August 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" One of a number of films from the late-eighties that created a short-lived sub-genre of the buddy movie by making one of the buddies a mutt, K-9 stars John Belushi's kid brother as the wisecracking maverick cop who gets saddled with an eccentric police Alsatian called Jerry Lee while trying to bring down a drugs baron.Of course, the beauty of creating a sub-genre like this is that you don't actually have to change your storyline the dog could be a professional criminal cuffed to the cop, a novelist carrying out research, or a dental equipment salesman who has unwittingly scuppered the cop's arrest. The changes required to the plot are minor and all can be applied to the same template. The big advantage upon which this film plays is that dogs are cute while most humans are not&#133; Given that it covers no new ground, K-9 is reasonably entertaining without containing the requisite number of laughs to be considered a major success. The relationship between Belushi and his charge follows the predictable route from mutual belligerence to guarded respect to genuine affection, and includes all the situations you would expect from the given scenario Dog refuses to obey instructions, dog disrupts man's love life, dog poops in man's house, etc. It's all carried out with a breezy sense of fun that is matched by Belushi's performance. Nobody is taking anything seriously here, and this is evident on the screen and probably makes K-9 a better film than it might otherwise have been. Belushi makes a likable hero &#150; he looked for a while as if he would step out from his brother's shadow and become a major film comedian but his career has dipped since the eighties. An even worse fate awaited his canine co-star, a real police dog, who died from gunshot wounds while apprehending a suspect a couple of years after the movie was shot.Director Rod Daniel manages to blend the action and comedy sequences quite well while remaining strictly within parameters set by those who've gone before him and, although he displays a reasonably assured touch here, his workmanlike approach might explain why his film career has also gone nowhere. All in all, K-9 largely manages to avoid the excessive sentimentality that normally plagues this kind of man-and-beast story, and is pleasing enough entertainment for those who don't set the bar too high.

My local stores all told me that it was out of print and I had no chance of getting it - well I finally managed to and it now takes pride of place on top of my t.v set.

Unfortunately by that I don't mean in a good way.The policeman played by Belushi is an utterly nasty and unlikable character. While he may have been involuntarily partnered with the dog, it hardly justifies his abusive behavior towards him. There is nary a laugh in the whole movie, and the dog clearly moves faster than a real dog possibly could.The movie poster ironically shows the dog with its paw on Belushi's shoulder, giving the impression that the movie was going to be much nicer than it was. It should have shown the dog tearing out Belushi's throat.

I can't call it a full comedy either. But sure it's fun movie about having a dog for the first time.It's part exaggerated, like the scene in which the dog turns into a monster in the bar while the directing didn't express well how he defeated all of the robust thugs! It's part cheesy, like the last encounter between the lead and the evil guy where the last was capable, so easily, of killing both the lead along side his girl while he didn't! And it's part naive; watch how the lead empties his gun shooting the bad guy crazily for nothing but hurting his dog? We didn't have the chance later to know appropriately what happened to that evil guy or how this situation ended !! Nevertheless, the soundtrack was fully diverting, having smart sense of humor. James Belushi looked excellent whether as tough cop or funny man. And Mel Harris, who acted as his girl, got such an unforgettably wonderful pair of legs! Still the movie's highest point is the way it shows the start of a good relationship between a grown man and a dog cutely. And it's surely more fun than the year's other buddy-action comedy about a cop and a dog (Turner & Hooch).Finally, I have an advise for you  don't watch it with your girl, because it's not a chick movie, it's rather exclusively a guys, kids and dogs movie !

The plot is just the typical 90's action cop vs. drug-lord movie, and is absolutely nothing special and is not offering anything new. I found the dog very annoying, with nearly no redeeming qualities, at all. I don't know if it's supposed to play on most peoples unconditional love for a dog, but it didn't work on me. I watched this movie mainly to see a movie with James Belushi, and he does his typical stuff in this movie too, and he is pretty funny, if you like this type of humor. I don't think anyone who isn't either a fan of James Belushi, or a lover of dogs, would like this movie. In fact, they might even hate it. If it wasn't for Belushi, I'd have hated the movie. Belushi, and a little role by Ed O'Neill saved this for me. I truly, deeply, *hated* the dog, for every single moment he was in the movie, apart from one or two scenes, or a few things it did. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't in one of the two aforementioned groups. 5/10 "}]
