I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday, so I got to see all the sequels. May I say that I'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least the past two, it just seems like Freddy lost his edge. It's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that wasn't needed, sorry to Robert Englund, but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents.Freddy is back, but he's got something we don't know about, a daughter. Maggie, she's not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She has to do her best to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, isn't it? But Freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just had bad acting, stupid editing, and just over all a bad idea for a story. I didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not Father Knows Best.2/10 "},{"Title":"Lots of fun","Date":"7 March 2003","Score":"33 out of 49 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  I guess I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film.  Is it one of the best of the Nightmare series?  Maybe not, but I had lots of fun with it.  Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential.  Since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down, I felt this so-called final installment (New Nightmare is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump.  There are some great nightmare sequences, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which Freddy controls.  This is both a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape, hopping around like Super Mario.  And Freddy belts out the funny one-liner, Great graphics.  And since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove.  Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove.  The cast is superb.  Lisa Zane is perfectly cast in the lead.  I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since The Running Man, and I think the last time I saw that film was about 5 years ago.  He's another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence.  And who can forget the cameos?  The best one is by Johnny Depp (from the first Nightmare) playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial.  The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome!  So for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on DVD!  Hopefully all the editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has the 3D element removed.  I personally didn't see many things wrong with the film.  It even elaborated on Freddy's backstory.  The film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the gross-out effects are terrific.  Could this have given better justice to the franchise?  Of course it could have.  But Rachel Talalay did a fine job.  And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.And in closing, I loved the montage over the opening credits.  Fans of the series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy.   My score  7 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"Freddy's Dead?

I should've slept in. Not just the worst Nightmare movie, but one of the worst films of all time. Yes, Freddy hasn't been scary since the second film, but at least he had some good joke writers up until part 4. New Line execs Talalay and DeLuca thought they could write and direct a film...not-uh. This time around it's like a ten-year-old penned his quips that are eye-rollingly bad. Freddy on a broomstick?? Freddy playing Nintendo?? Man, not only is Freddy dead, the series has been dead since the end of part 4. Although I can say I'd still watch part 5 over this. The plot is the worst slog of any of the films, as Freddy even disappears for a half hour while the thing is laid out. The lead that is carrying it all is one of the weakest actors I've encountered, Shon Greenblat. His look and delivery is all wrong, the same going for Ricky Dean Logan. His death scene is one of the stupidest things I've ever watched, as he's agonizingly slain with a Q-tip (stop laughing). Screaming endlessly in a dorky pitch, it's painful for the viewer as well. The Nintendo death is horrifically idiotic as well, as all slasher-film tone is demolished as a victim jumps all over a room in a trance, ala a video game character. Complete with jump sound effects and superhuman strength, it was the moment where I raised a hand to the screen going Come on, what is this crap?. And after Freddy is dead, star Zane and her Freddy's dead!, and head-tossing smile puts a cap on this steaming mess of a movie. Later Fred, thanks for the 80s memories, I don't blame you, but the writers.

There were some moments that could have been good, but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities, and don't get me started on the bad.The wasted opportunities are pretty obvious, but I will recap them here in case anyone cares. Anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. The first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with Freddy's long-lost child. Now, the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer (and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people, leave alone to this extent) is HEREDITARY, so why not a mystery-type slasher in which Lisa Zane's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? Sound like a good plot idea to you? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca.Then there's the trip to Springfield, where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. Funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner, although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. The essential problem with this plot element, however, is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show.Of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct, but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. That, in a nutshell, is probably the biggest problem with Freddy's Dead it just doesn't try at all, leave alone hard enough.On a related note, I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character. He has played far better characters in far better productions (the science-fiction miniseries V, for example), and to be forever remembered as the man who played Freddy is selling him rather short. It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. As for the rest of the cast, well, I think their performances here speak for themselves. They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than B-grade horror props. Even Yaphet Kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of B-films.All in all, Freddy's Dead gets a 1 out of me. I'd vote lower, but the IMDb doesn't allow for that. FD is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film, but an entire franchise.

How good can the sixth installment of any series be, let alone a string of low-budget frightfests? Yet I am not of the belief that horror series are doomed to run out of steam. Heck, I think Friday THE 13TH got better with age. But although I had an open mind while watching what was supposedly the last NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET film, I found it a bitter disappointment in every way.Once again, our favorite grotesquely-disfigured dream stalker is after a group of teens, dispatching them one by one as they sleep. Yet none of the creativity or style of the previous films is present. Whatever happened to sequences such as the waterbed from Part 4 or the marionette from Part 3? It's as though producers cobbled this together just for the sake of making another Freddy film.Other shortcomings abound. While other NIGHTMARE entries have been nothing short of brilliant at making the most of a limited budget, FREDDY'S DEAD looks the cheapest of them all. This is especially true when we see a younger Freddy meet the computer-generated dream spirits. It was reminiscent of a third-rate Saturday morning children's show. Humor was attempted here, with cameos by Johnny Depp and Roseann Arnold and a video game sequence with Freddy at the joystick, but it all falls flat. The acting is stale and Rachal Talalay directorial debut uninspired.The finale is a particular disappointment. Of all the memorable ways Freddy has been killed in previous films, is having his daughter turn his own glove against him the best they could come up with? Granted, the idea of bringing the killer into the real world was a good one, but its potential was not fully explored.Overall FREDDY'S DEAD is arguably one of the worst -- if not the worst -- films in this popular saga. And yes, that includes Part 2 and the overly artsy DREAM CHILD. One has to believe that if they had it to do all over again, the people behind this film could come up with something a lot better than this.

This cannot be an Elm Street movie. This feels more like a spoof of an Elm Street movie. A bad spoof. The Final Nightmare, bullshit. This is Freddy Movie 6.How bad is Freddy's Dead? It's a joke. The whole movie is a joke. It has to be. And it's just plain pathetic, too. I mean, it's so bad, even the puns are stupid (Nice hearing from you, Carlos! give me a break). I can't even start talking about the lack of characterization or bad dialogue. That's a little like saying Yeah, the Titanic did have a bad paint job, didn't it? Watching this film was a strange experience. You know how some people will complain that their favorite book was turned into a movie that left out all the good parts and they felt like the film was in fast-forward? That's what Freddy's Dead feels like. Like the film is in fast-forward. The story goes from event to event so fast that I don't even have time to digest what had just happened. And I have no idea what's going on in the story anyway. It lacks any kind of coherence and flow.It's just so over the top and goofy that I could not take much of this movie seriously at all. Was I suppose to? There is a scene in the movie in which Freddy kills a character by scratching his nails on a chalkboard. The kid's head promptly explodes. In a scene shortly thereafter, Freddy is controlling a kid by using a video game. The kid is bouncing around in reality, complete with BOING! BOING! sound effects. That absolutely cannot be meant to be taken seriously.So, does Freddy's Dead have any redeeming qualities? Believe it or not, yes. Some of the goofy stuff going on actually gets a couple laughs. Not a ton, but enough to make those scenes tolerable. Also, I will say that the acting is, in fact, an upgrade from the previous two movies. Even Robert Englund is a little better here than last time.But that's it. The movie as a whole is borderline unwatchable. Lack of intelligence and general logic makes most of this film unbearable. Oh, and something else that bugged me. A bunch of films that came out in the late 80s and early 90s tried the 3D gimmick. And in a lot of films that tried it back then, most of the 3D revolved around random objects being pointed straight at the camera. It happened here too. And it was really annoying. It does not look cool. And here's something that was the dumbest part of the 3D gimmick in the film, a character actually put on and took off magical 3D glasses to let the audience know when to wear the glasses and take them off. I wish I was making that up. That was as low as Freddy has gotten right there.Freddy's Dead is a mess. This could very well be the worst Elm Street movie. The visuals look bad, the screenplay is beyond idiotic, the characters are stupid, there is no directing style, it's overly goofy, and its best attribute is its incredibly mediocre acting. Freddy's Dead is a nightmare in itself.

After 5 movies it was NEVER explained exactly how it is possible that a dead person torments people in their dreams and manages to kill them by manifesting nightmares . At last , we have some substandard explanation . After the horrible #4 and the mediocre #5 not only we have improvement scriptwise but we have very interesting characters . Sure the video game sequence is kind of corny but the rest of the deaths were frightful. If anyone of you says that was not scared with Freddy killing the kid with the hearing problem is a total liar . The girl who plays Tracy simply kicks a** . She is dynamic and fights for her live in a very realistic way . Towards the end you will find yourself GLUED in your couch . You are very concerned for the lives of the characters . The script has a few inconsistencies like it is never explained how Freddy erased the existance of his victums from the memories of the others . It does not matter . The basic premise is for a teenager who believes he is the long lost son of Freddy Krueger andis stalked by him . He ends up in an asylum and being supervised by a male and female doctor who consider the idea of hypnosis and dream manipulation ( OK it reminds a bit of part 3 but we can forgive that ). The female doctor escorts him in a strange city to investigate for his roots and Freddy . Along with them go 3 more kids with problematic domestic backgrounds (e.g. one of them is Tracy being sexually abused by her own father) . I won't spoil the rest . The scenes in the strange city are Gothic and effective . The final showdowns between the heroes and the killer are the most intense in the entire series , excellently tied up with delusional flashbacks which after 6 movies are originaland prove that the dreamlike atmosphere can STILL be accepted and not a tired rehash . The writers made a perfect job . We learn all we wanted to know about Freddy 's history and the script neatly ties most of the loose ends of the series . There is a complaint  Why again drag him into the real world ? It didn 't work when Nancy(in #1) and Jesse(in #2) tried it  . I will have to remind you that they never actually managed to KILL him . He was defeated but not destroyed . Part 6 is not the best but one of the best in the series . FORGET the bad reviews and give it ashot . There is an extra bonus  you finally see what is the real face of Freddy before burned ( this scene is also included so you MUST SEE IT) . There are also slight references to the prequels . And a very cool hint  the vast ARSENAL of weaponry in the end !!!! See it alone and very late at night . You will be spooked.

Freddy is starting with a new group of teenagers who aren't relevant to the previous five movies in any way which make them as victims and characters (and, in some cases, as actors) even more forgettable than this movie. Perhaps the only thing that makes this movie watchable is that eeriness that makes Freddy fearsome. The only good thing that can be said about the sequels to this movie is that the eerie element is present in all of them, but is negligible due to overly high body counts, weak stories, and comedy.

After every mediocre attempt to reinvigorate the franchise, the series always seemed to be able to catch itself in a way that maintained some level of quality control with each passing installment. After the fifth film took the series in a more Gothic direction, while pleasantly adhering to the laws of the world of which Freddy inhabited, Freddy's Dead can't seem to adequately discern reality from the dream world. What entails is a hybrid of genres that dives head first into supreme campiness and forgoes much of the horror elements to continue with the trend of turning Freddy Krueger into a one-liner machine rather than an effective horror villain.The story revolves around a character known as John Doe (Shon Greenblatt), the last surviving teen in Springwood, where most teens have succumbed to an ugly, nocturnal fate from Freddy. In efforts to try and stop Freddy once and for all, an older psychologist named Maggie (Lisa Zane), who is looking to treat John for amnesia and mental illness, as well as his prolific and lucid nightmares about Freddy Krueger, and her friend Tracy (Lezlie Deane) work to try and enter the realm of Freddy's dreams in order to stop him from the source of his madness - his mind.The concept of Freddy's Dead loans itself to a lot of introspection for one of the most recognized killers in mainstream horror. The problem lies in the fact that, for one, we don't care about he characters. The previous films saw our connectedness to the characters stemming from the idea that we recognized them as helpless souls victim to the violent, merciless actions of Freddy. We saw them at the mercy of their fragile states of mind, often confined to the four walls of a mental asylum in order to try and maintain some level of sanity. Freddy's Dead robs us of that level of helplessness and fails to provide a compelling alternative, giving us characters with little backstory or detail to them and a pacing that is so slow that it fails to amount to anything.During the nineties, horror films became far more campy than their seventies and eighties predecessors. Newer horror films, both theatrically released and made exclusively for the direct-to-video market, excessively added the campiness factor to their films. Even franchise titles released during this decade saw a turn far more into cheeky, meta territory. Freddy's Dead is no exception. Its change becomes solidified when, during the film's most absurd scene, Freddy controls Breckin Meyer's slacker Spencer character as he haphazardly wanders through a traditional nineties platform video game via his claw-hand, which has somehow morphed into a Nintendo Power Glove. While doing so, Freddy recites popular Nintendo marketing slogans from the time period, in addition to adding his trademark zingers to the mix, as well.Scenes like this cut somebody like me off fairly quickly, somebody who admired the sheer helplessness and peril the audience was victim to, much like the helpless characters, in films like Dream Warriors and The Dream Child. Freddy's Dead goes for the cheap laugh, on top of creating a film that, once again, abandons the conventional laws of what Freddy can do and where he can go. Instead of confining him to the dream world, directress Rachel Talalay spins the story in such a way that blurs the line of what's reality and what exists in the dream world, and not in the mindbending way you're expecting from reading that. She does so in a muddled fashion that creates apathy to the point where once the characters are not interesting, the suspense is far too slow and unrewarding to really pay any mind to, and Freddy is more a joker than someone who can legitimately terrorize and haunt you that the film becomes more of a joke laughing at itself.The film is most known for its 3D end sequence, which I indeed experienced with the now-vintage red/blue, cardboard 3D glasses. The good thing about this sequence is that it makes you grateful that some executive at New Line Cinema refused to greenlight a feature-length 3D Freddy film; even for the time period, this is some of the most atrocious 3D I've yet to see. Normally, when one takes off the cardboard glasses during a 3D movie, they see a distorted picture on the screen that becomes almost incomprehensible with the presence of wavy red/blue outlines around characters and dichotomous color hues taking prominence on screen. Even with the glasses on, this effect remains, effectively making an incoherent picture that made me feel like I was taking an eye exam instead of watching a film. It doesn't matter, however, as the 3D isn't even used for an added layer or sense of depth, but for a cheap gimmick, as we see fiery skulls, Freddy's face, and various kinds of worms propelled in our face for the fourteen-minute sequence.Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is a depressing way to conclude such a legendary, indelible franchise, which practically begged that the series needed to be rebooted in some way by its original writer and director. It's a film that's too campy to be scary and true to the themes and approach of its predecessor, and too gimmicky to be of any particular substance. Without Wes Craven's New Nightmare, a seriously underrated and commendable attempt at meta and psychological horror with Craven using his trademark Freddy character to bend reality and fiction in a far more believable and organized way, we could've ended this franchise on a film that is little more than a curious, early-nineties oddity that should be delegated to the back pages of a cult/forgotten cinema catalog.Starring Lisa Zane, Shon Greenblatt, Robert Englund, Lezlie Deane, and Breckin Meyer.

However, just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it &#150; I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I do recall, some of the sequels &#150; Dream Warriors in particular &#150; weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out we know this is garbage &#150; but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing? And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr &#150; har &#150; har &#150; hars and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written you're f**ked. When prompted for the map, Carlos responds well the map says we're f**ked. Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin &#150; a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. Nice hearing from you, Carlos, quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with shut the f**k up, man and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.

Freddy's goal is to create new Elm Streets, and begin a new killing spree after having killed of all of the children in Springwood.Maggie, utilizing new dreams techniques, uncovers Krueger's past, which include being taunted by schoolmates for being the son of 100 maniacs, being cruel to animals, beaten by his stepfather, the murder of his own wife when she discovers he has been killing children and the moment when the Dream Demons arrive in his boiler room to make him the offer of eternal life. Eventually, Maggie pulls Freddy out of the dream world and uses a pipe bomb to blow him up.The story is a little scary, but also funny as heck. It is considered the worst idea for the movie, but it works for me and to say the least, it is the best of A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, for me, along with the 1984 and 2010 versions of the original film, the 2003 crossover film with Jason Voorhees, the fourth film, the third and second film and Wes Craven's New Nightmare.Like I said, the only Nightmare on Elm Street film I have mixed emotions over is A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child.There's not much to say about the visuals and design, but they are incredible as they were back in 1991, when this film came out. The way the comedy and horror works with Freddy is just as impressive and inspiring. The music is just cool as hell. Brian May is a great composer and he done a very great job with the music in the film and the famous original theme is in this film.The acting is a little confusing, but I will give credit to Lisa Zane as Maggie Burroughs / Katherine Krueger. She does a great job and I don't think she could have been worse in any of the scenes in this film. Robert Englund returns as Freddy Krueger and his performances is cool as hell. My favorite scenes are when Freddy tells Maggie, Every town has an Elm Street and the parody of the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz.My favorite nightmare is the video game nightmare and that was really funny, scary, but also really cool and amazing. It was fantastic, man. The rest of the cast is just out there at times, but the really cool thing about it is Lezlie Deane, Yaphet Kotto, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan is really amazing and so great in some of the scenes.Overall, Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is not a horror movie, it's like a horror / comedy movie and is not the best film in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse.5 out of 10 stars.

Then again... if you've watched any of the other Freddy/Nightmare on Elm Street films, then you're probably used to seeing Freddy get bumped off at the end of the ninety minutes then come back again.So, this film in the 'Nightmare' series is the last. Or at least it is in the same way that 1984's 'Friday 13th The Final Chapter' was the 'final' Friday 13th film (there were approximately eight future installments including remakes and spin-offs).Here Freddy takes top billing once again, as he looks for pastures new to continue his evil killing spree, after wiping out every single child in Springwood. The 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series has divided fans. Those who like the franchise serious and dark (and, dare I say it, Freddy at his scariest?) like parts I-III. However, after that, Freddy tended to drop his sinister undertones and become more of an 'evil clown,' spouting comic one-liners after each kill. 'Freddy's Dead' can be put squarely in the latter's bracket.If you don't mind Freddy's 'humour' then you should enjoy this one, as it's not that scary. However, it does tend to recycle a few of the franchise's old plot lines, plus copies one of the later ideas from the Friday 13th series (regarding a relation of the central killer). The film-makers also tried a new trick (now the 'norm') of introducing a 3D element near the end of the film, although you probably will hardly notice if you're watching it at home on DVD or Blu-ray.I enjoyed it, but I was always okay with the 'Freddy-light' portrayal of the demon killer in the later movies.http//thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/ "},{"Title":"Freddy's Dead..or he wants to be after watching this!","Date":"22 September 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" God AWFUL!!

Right out of the gate, the film sets a unique tone with its Goo Goo Dolls infused opening. Long gone is the terror of Fred Krueger, the man who haunted Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) in Wes Craven's original masterpiece. This Freddy is a pop-culture icon, a comedian if you will. And his status only serves to dilute and justify the existence of this supposed closing chapter of the iconic '80s series.Like most '80s slasher franchises trying to make their way in the '90s, Freddy's Dead struggles between carrying over a built-in audience and appealing to a new generation of movie-goers. The sixth entry in the beloved series, as helmed by long-time franchise line producer (see baby-sitter) Rachel Talalay, can't help but succumb to the conventions that merely nagged at its predecessors. Rather than turning the odd joke in between killings, the man of your nightmares, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), has become a full-blown comedian, and a lame one at that.While the film carries great production value and presents some of Freddy's most outlandish nightmares to date, it suffers thoroughly in trying to spook its audience. Krueger has all the menace of Wile E. Coyote in this film, turning pure carnage into a Saturday-morning cartoon for the big kids. Englund is in fine form as the man of your dreams (err, nightmares), but the film neuters him to the point where he serves merely as a punch-line. Talalay should know the character inside and out by this point, but she apparently lacks the vision to realize what exactly it is that makes Freddy tick. What was merely a symptom in the previous entry, The Dream Child, is a full-blown epidemic in this film. Put simply, Freddy is indeed dead.Now, Freddy's Dead isn't completely horrible. For one thing, it's a great looking film. If nothing else, it boasts the best production values in the series in its time. The film also features a gaggle of fun cameos -- from the likes of Roseanne & Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp -- which keep the affair fun and light-hearted. There's no doubt that this is the weakest Elm Street of them all (taking even the 2010 remake into consideration) but there is definitely enough juice to keep it from becoming unwatchable. Just temper your expectations and realize that, hey, this the sixth film in a franchise wherein its main villain dons a Nintendo Powerglove. How great could it have ever been?

One of the biggest offenses here is the absolutely inane and over-the-top comedy injected into the film, from the never-ending quips and one-liners to the physical slapstick of the kills that are no longer horror at all and instead pure comedy.

But I must say, the whole stupidity of the whole affair blots out all the fun I might have had.This movie's list of atrocities is endless. While I don't mind Freddy being a comedian while killing, this movie has him acting like Bugs Bunny- he imitates the Wicked Witch of the West, he makes a guy bounce up and down like a human pogo stick, he pushes a bed of nails under a falling victim. He kills a guy with a Q-Tip- that's right, a Q-TIP!!! All of the dreams/killings drag on and on- and there are only three of them, despite the fact that there are plenty of other stupid, annoying characters begging to be offed.But most insulting of all is the plot twist that reveals that Freddy has a kid (much like the bone-headed decision to give Jason a sister in Jason Goes to Hell). I don't mind these shocking revelations- in fact, I liked the flashbacks to Freddy's suburban life before he was burned to death- but they don't make sense when you look back at the previous entries in the series. What, did Freddy just forget he had a daughter? That's the problem with a bunch of sequels that are each directed by someone different- there's not much continuity. Parts 3-5 are a nice little trilogy that all go together, but this one seems to have no thought at all behind it.Oh, and I almost forgot there's a painful cameo by Mr. And Mrs. Tom Arnold (that's how they're billed in the credits)!

I had high hopes for it, as I had enjoyed The Dream Master so much, but I was sadly disappointed by the boring, silly film. So, naturally, I took a look at the reviews for Freddy's Dead, which were all very poor. However, I would not lose faith in Freddy, so I watched it anyway. And I am happy to say that I was actually not disappointed! Possibly because the filmmakers scrapped the concept they used with 5, to make it dark, and embraced the humor of the series. Which worked terrifically.Let's begin with the acting. Robert Englund is amazing in this film, and does not disappoint. He has managed to do something he hasn't for the first time in a long time, which is being both funny and scary! The part where he kills his wife after she discovers his secret room with the gloves, he genuinely looks psychotic, and still creeps me out. He was also fantastic in the climax when he taunted his daughter and attempted to trick her by reverting back to his original form, before he was burned. Lisa Zane is amazing and thoroughly steals the show. And the little girl who played her as a kid, she was better than the teenagers in The Dream Master! This also marks the first film that Breckin Meyer was in. Also, the acting by both other actors that both played Freddy were also equally creepy as Robert Englund, looking just plain crazy.Now onto the plot Freddy is back, now less Gothic and funny again, who attacks John Doe, the only child to ever survive his murder spree. He orders him to track down a girl by the name of Maggie Borroughs, who is actually his daughter. Now with all the children in Springwood, Ohio taken care of, Krueger finds her at a rehab clinic for troubled kids, where she is a guidance counselor. He very creepily gets the kids, showing off his abilities to completely dominate, wisecracking all the way. Now Maggie falls asleep to confront Freddy, pull him out into the real world, and kill him. But will it work? I absolutely adored the plot, and thought it was very creative. (Although the film could have done without the 3-D) I do love the part where she goes into his brain and sees the snake demon sculptures. (Which were fantastic and realistic puppets) Now onto the comedy The film is as funny as ever, and although Freddy pops a few too many wisecracks, they are still very funny and clever. People who think the film is silly need to realize that, like Bride of Chucky and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the film is meant to be goofy and scary. Which it is. The power glove scene where the stoner by the name of Spencer is pulled into a television (featuring a cameo by Johnny Depp who is doing a 'your brain on drugs' public service announcement when he is promptly hit in the face with the frying pan by Freddy) Who proceeds to make him into a video game, having some fun with him. This is a very fun scene, though not very scary. It is just a fun film, but also manages to be disturbing.As a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, I thought that this film was very good, much better than previous entries, managing to successfully be both funny and scary. I know I am part of a select minority who enjoyed the film, but I think that the film is a highly underrated sequel, and very fun to watch. If you want my advice, see it. Hopefully you will like it, like me. ) My rating 7 out of 10.

Well, the first one of them. Then came New, Vs., and *then* the continuity was rebooted last year. Other than meaning to close the door, this was to be the most laugh-garnering one(or so it would seem). Unfortunately, sometimes when you set out to do something specific, you end up trying too hard. By a lot. Not all attempts at humor work(and the majority were certainly too silly and goofy for my tastes... maybe they won't be for yours). Once or twice, it is hilarious. There is absurdity and a bit of black comedy. Maybe the odd use of music is supposed to be amusing, too. Like the first, second and fifth, we get some likable, well-developed and interesting characters with credible relationships between them. The dialog is often good. Meyer did a nice job back then, in his debut. Acting varies in this, but much of it isn't bad. The appearance by Roseanne and Tom Arnold is thankfully short. This has a running time of a mere 80 minutes sans credits. We join a young man who suffers from memory loss, as he comes upon a group of maladjusted teens. Krueger returns, and we find out more about him and his past(I personally think this is the worst thing to do, because it takes the mystery away... others disagree with me). This is creepy at times, though Freddy is a veritable prankster(ugh) in this, and yes, that includes how he goes about his business. There is a bit of bloody, gory violence and strong language in this.

The film appears to take place 10 years from now, but that doesn't seem to matter, as the basis of the film revolves around one surviving teen from Elm Street, a John Doe (Shon Greenblatt) who manages to escape - but that's what Freddy Krueger (once more thank you Robert Englund) wanted, as Freddy is seeking out his daughter.Like part 5, Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare delves heavily into Freddy's past, and does so in a way that is not complicated nor condescending to the viewer and doesn't mess with pre-established continuity either, but very informative. We learn that he has a wife and indeed a daughter, who now, is all grown up and is a psychiatrist, Dr. Maggie Burroughs played by the lovely Lisa Zane. In her care are some troubled teens who all get caught up in Freddy's plot. Lezlie Deane was okay as the aggressive Tracy, though why she survived the film is beyond me. Ricky Dean Logan was dispensable as Carlos, and Breckin Meyer was fun as Spencer - it is easy to see why he went on to have a good film career. Yaphet Kotto is rather boring as the Doctor, while Roseanne (yes, the Roseanne), Elinor Donahue and Marilyn Rockafellow are all outstanding in their small roles.Several factors contribute to making Freddy's Dead so unique Talalay's passion for the franchise is one of them. The fact that the heroine of the film is not teenage or slightly out of being a teen like Heather Langenkamp in #3 is another, as Zane is clearly made out to be an intelligent woman. What's also interesting is that the only real connection to the previous films is through Freddy. Parts 2 and 3 were clearly connected to the original, while 4 was connected to 3, and 5 to 4. The 6th entry stands alone, in that there are no returning characters (except for Freddy), or plots.Another factor is the 3-D aspect. Now, 3-D was long past its hey-day of the 80's, but it was an interesting attempt at revival. However, only the finale is filmed in 3-D and it doesn't quite work, to be honest, it is rather hard to watch. The DVD has the option of watching it in 2-D or 3-D, and special features indicate that Talalay herself was not completely happy with having her ending in 3-D.So while Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is no master piece like the first or 7th films, it is not without its redeeming features, and is really a good film when it comes down to it.

And whilst I definitely adhere to the theory that horror and comedy shouldn't mix, I actually thought this movie was an exception. The producers combined wit and horror quite well.It's the 'final' film in one sense if you don't count Wes Craven's New Nightmare which was a film within a film. The story stars the beautiful Lisa Zane as Dr. Maggie who is working at a centre for children who have nowhere to go. It seems that Freddy is still making a nuisance of himself and instead of retiring to the Rest Home for Boogeymen, Freddy is still plaguing the dreams of youngsters. It turns out that Dr. Maggie is actually the daughter of Freddy Krueger and is the only one that can finally put him to rest along with help from Doc played by Yaphet Kotto. It seems Doc has finally worked out a way to vanquish Freddy for good.There's an almost equal mix of horror and comedy in this film. Comedy scenes include Freddy on a broomstick and playing a video game; however, there are quite a few chills which Nightmare on Elm Street parts 4 and 5 certainly didn't have. Whilst not as fearsome as the Freddy in the original, Freddy in this movie still scares.There's a few flashback scenes to Freddy's childhood and pre-boogeyman life. Character development is always welcome even when it comes to horror villains. It gives them an edge and helps us understand their motives more. There are various scenes of Freddy as a schoolboy and a young adult.The climax of the film is decent enough-not on par with the climax for the original but decent enough. And yes, Freddy really does die in this film. The next installment wasn't the original Freddy (well, not really)so Freddy really did die. It gave one a sense of closure when the film ends with Freddy vanquished and Dr Maggie saying, Freddy's dead! You won't see any end credits with a hand rising or Freddy laughing.

The town of Springwood, Ohio has undergone an insignificant change. All the children and teenagers were murdered by Freddy and all the adults succumbed to psychosis. There was however one teenage survivor and he was at that moment on board an airplane flying through a fierce storm. His name was John Doe and he was sitting right next to the window. He requested another seat but was denied. Suddenly, he fell through the floor and right into his house which he found was also flying in the air. He looked out the window and saw Freddy riding by on a broomstick vowing to get John and his little soul too. Soon, the house crash landed to the ground and soon John was hit by a bus driven by Freddy, but it seemed as if Freddy wasn't out to kill John. He sent him back into the real world apparently on a mission for him. John awakened with a news paper headline that read, Krueger Woman Still Missing. The police pick up John and take him to a youth center. The head doctor was named Doc and his assistant was Maggie Burroughs. Some of the teens at the center consisted of Carlos, who was deaf and abused by his parents; Tracy, an aggressive street punk and Spencer, who had a drug problem. John had amnesia. He didn't know who he was, all he remembered was that he was from Springwood. Maggie decided to take him to Springwood in hopes of triggering his memory so they get into a van and drive there. They soon discover three stowaways Carlos, Tracy and Spencer. They stop at a county fair where there are no children and the adults are definitely not playing with a full deck.Maggie and John go search for signs of intelligent life. Maggie ordered Tracy, Spender and Carlos to take the van back to the center. They tried but no matter which way they turned, they kept going in a circle. They decided to give up and camped out in a house that was in fact the abandoned Nightmare house on Elm Street. Carlos fell asleep on one of the dusty beds and was soon visited by Freddy who stole his hearing aid. He soon gave it back, but it was now sound enhanced so a dripping faucet would sound like a volcano. Freddy proceeded to drop pins and scrape his knife fingers across a black board which resulted in Carlos' head exploding. Spencer next fell prey to Freddy in an all-too-real video game! Tracy alone went off to find Maggie who had stopped at the old high school with John and found a history teacher teaching an invisible class. They learn that Freddy Krueger had offspring! The three soon meet. John has an encounter with Freddy who kills him because his mission was complete. His mission was to bring Freddy his daughter and he did. His daughter was in fact Maggie who was once called Katherine Krueger. As a little girl, she once witnessed her parents Freddy and Loretta have a terrible fight because Loretta had discovered Freddy's secrets; Freddy visited Tracy and Doc in their dreams. Before Doc awakened, he ripped off a piece of Freddy's sweater and brought it back with him.Doc had a plan. He would send Maggie into the dream realm with a pair of magic glasses. Her mission was to grab Freddy and bring him into the real world. She entered the dream realm and entered Freddy's brain where she saw how Freddy was picked on as a lad and was abused by his foster father. Next, Maggie encounters real Freddy and grabs him and successfully brings him back. Since Freddy was now in the real world, he could be hurt like a real person so Tracy, Doc and Maggie grab an arsenal of weapons and head for Fred. Maggie pins Freddy to the wall with daggers and stars. She impales him with a steel rod and finally sticks a stick of dynamite into him and...KABOOM! Freddy was blown to bits. Three little demons who gave Freddy his immortal power right when he was burned alive flew out of him. That was the end of Freddy Krueger!Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is one of the good ones! That and Part 4 and New Nightmare are my favorites. Robert Englund plays Freddy Krueger, both with and without the mask. Lisa Zane plays Maggie and is very pretty!

Well, it's 6 films at this point and this one really plumbs the depths. It starts with text on the screen telling us it's 10 years later and all but one of the teens of Sprinwood have been killed. A painfully long sequence follows this boy's attempts to escape ,going through numerous moments of waking up from a dream..oh no! I'm still dreaming...waking up...oh no I'm still dreaming.etc etc; with him ending up amnesiac and ending up in a young people's shelter. One of the doctor's -without any investigation or saying  hey that's the town where all the teens are dead - drives him back, with a few stowaway teens in the back. They find the town nearly abandoned with the adults reduced to gibbering idiots, and the teens are inexplicably unable to drive out without coming full circle. This sequence is so unrealistic and dreamlike I assumed that it would turn out that this is a dream as well, but no, so why couldn't the kids escape? Just one of many unanswered plot-holes. Anyway, two of the teens are killed in incredibly tedious, overlong ways - a deaf lad is made to have super hearing and Freddy eventually makes his head explode by...get ready for this...scraping his glove across a blackboard and another boy is sucked into a dated looking computer game and bounced around the house game character style for what seems like 15 minutes...To cut things short, the survivor lad is killed and when they get back to the home no one else can remember the dead kids - this is because Freddy didn't just kill them- he erased them! says the standard horror film character Mysterious Guy Who Somehow Knows What's Going On. How or why Freddy's suddenly started doing this is nver explained or mentioned again.Get this- it then turns out that the Dr is Freddy's daughter and Freddy gets his power from 'Dream Demons' that gave him immortality when he was getting burnt.Think this might have been mentioned before now... Having totally run out of ideas now ,they go back to the original film and drag Freddy into reality by waking up someone who grabs hold of him in their dream. His daughter kills him with his own glove and weapons from the stash confiscated from the kids in the home, including a crossbow, ninja throwing stars, and finally a pipe bomb. It's really hard to explain what a total mess this film is. Freddy as a villain is totally ineffectual and unscary here- somehow moreso than recetn installments. The plot makes little sense ,with the lead character being killed off halfway and no explanation made of where he came from, or sign of his parents in the town. The surreal and absurd Springwood episode kills any credibility and a town with every teen been killed could have been developed into a very interesting idea, but all we get is a babbling schoolteacher. The script is terrible and the acting stands out as bad is in a series known for its poor performances. Freddy actually disappears for a long period in the middle, but when he appears all we get is bad one liners and very boring kills.Also ,it really looks like a bloke in a rubber head rather than someone with serious burns. I think the problem with these films is that none of them are as good as the basic idea of a burnt knife-fingered maniac murdering kids in their dreams. They should have just left it at the original, because we are looking at an equivalent of 'Jaws the Revenge'here.

The alleged Final Nightmare starts off with a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche which carries an unusual amount of dramatic intensity for a Nightmare on Elm Street movie since it fits so well with the series' running theme, and is then followed by a sophomoric quote from Freddy at his classiest, 'Welcome to Prime Time, B**ch.' This is followed by a parody of The Wizard of Oz in which we see Freddy flying on a broom and yelling, 'I'll get you my pretty! And your little SOUL too!! HAW HAW HAW!!' And thus is the tone set for the rest of the movie. Instead of taking place at the setting of a mental hospital, this one takes place at a zero security shelter for disturbed kids. And I say 'zero security' very literally. Police find junkies on the streets and send them to this place rather than deal with the paperwork involved in putting kids in juvenile hall, and yet detention at the facility is literally based on encouraging them not to leave. It's like attendance is based on the honor system. At one point, one of the counselors (and the main character in the story), takes John Doe, their newest guest, on a trip back to his home town to confront the demons that are messing up his cognitive function. On the way there they find three kids stowing away in the company car (which is a decrepit old white van covered in obscene graffiti), planning to escape. Rather than return them to the facility, she has them drop her and John Doe off at their destination and promise to DRIVE THEMSELVES BACK IMMEDIATELY!! What kind of a detention center is this anyway? In case you were wondering, no thought was wasted on how she and John Doe were meant to get back themselves.That being said, the rest of the movie really isn't that bad, as long as you keep it in context of such scenes as that described above. The movie takes place 10 years after part 5 left off, and our John Doe is a mystery character who suffers from amnesia and is not all that anxious to have it cured. The basic premise is that Freddy has a kid running around somewhere who he intends to use to bring him fresh victims, giving him more time to concentrate on expanding his territory ('There's an Elm Street in every town!'). The movie smartly concentrates on the possibilities offered by the blurring of the line between reality and the dream world of unconsciousness, which is the exact thing that made the original movie so successful. Back then, you had a villain that was morbidly likable and a premise to which anyone could relate to because it's based on the real life crossing of that line, which you never really notice doing. Unfortunately, the movie trips all over itself with a series of ridiculous killing scenes which illustrate the sheer extent to which writers are running out of clever ideas for how Freddy should claim his victims. One poor kid gets his ear cut off, then Freddy gives it back to him, the kid picks it up and says, 'Yes!!' and then puts it on the other side of his head (the side which still has an ear attached to it), and Freddy proceeds to make loud noises until the kid's head explodes. What the hell was that?Breckin Meyer makes an early appearance as some Freddy fodder and suffers a video game fate in which the entire movie stops in its tracks so that Freddy can put his feet up on the desk and kill someone with a joystick. It's not hard to tell that this movie was made at the height of Nintendo hysteria. We do get an interesting look into Freddy's past in which we learn not about the disturbing method of his conception, but what hid life was like before he became the Freddy Krueger we know. The kids in the movie come up with a pretty clever (and long overdue) plot to kill Freddy once and for all, but it's good that this was not the final installment in the series, if only because it would have been such an anticlimactic close to a series that had thus far spawned five sequels and fans around the world.The film originally featured a thrilling 3-D conclusion which, to the best of my knowledge, has been scrapped by the DVD production, I imagine because of the necessity for 3-D glasses. Still, we get a look inside Freddy's brain as well as a host of other scenes (including Freddy's alleged death), which surely must have been a blast to see in 3-D. Sadly, the rest of the movie probably couldn't even have been supported on this gimmick alone, because it certainly doesn't have a lot else going for it.

Freddy is a joker, and is not threatening at all. I suppose this makes some sense, because with all the power Freddy had it would only take a matter of time before he got so cynical in his killings.

But even with all the effects, it'll be the clever camera tricks that will have you thinking how'd they do that? There are only 3 deaths but they are pretty good and creative ones at least. In part 5 a kid is sucked into a comic book, in this one a kid is sucked into a video game. The results of this are way better than in part 5.Then there's the plot- which is stupid. But at this point in the Nightmare On Elm Street series, you can't expect anything good. It's reached the point of campiness and for some reason I just went with it in Freddy's Dead.

What we have here is a magnificently senseless and silly Elm Street film. I know it's a taboo to say, but it can't get any worse than this &#x96; and it won't, since this abomination is technically the whimper that the Nightmare franchise ended with, since Freddy vs Jason happened via a retcon and New Nightmare is a different breed. I first thought that this may not be the wisest hour and a half I've spend in my life in the opening five minutes, where the protagonist is subjected to the 'horror' of rolling down a hill for five minutes, moaning like he's giving birth through his anus, but not before witnessing Kruger on a broomstick dressed up as the Wicked Witch of the West taunting him. Speaking of Kruger, was the makeup department on strike or something during production? It looks like they just mashed bubble gum on Englund's face. After some more silly moments in the opening half hour or so, the film has four unlikable twats travel to Springwood, where all the kids and teenagers have long since been bumped off by Freddy, and as a result the adults all are a bit retarded. This is where the film pretty much runs out of whatever steam it had and becomes a bore fest, going through the typical motions of misguidedly and amateurishly exposing the villain's unnecessary backstory about being bullied as a kid and revealing a protagonist's disturbing rape during childhood at the hands of her own father, but not before we get to see Freddy play Nintendo in 3D and bust out dance moves behind a deaf guy. It's uneven to say the least. Stale acting and the worst special effects in all the movies mean there isn't much to take from The Final Nightmare, unless you want a lesson in how to strip a horror icon of all his dreadfulness.

As I think about it the story could have been told more coherently as much as I want to keep Freddy a mysterious character the back- story isn't too bad. I think Wes' ideas of what he was before is better than this overall but looking at the story elements it's own was pretty decent.The problem is the execution of the ideas I mentioned. They're all played for laughs and honestly it's not that funny. Maybe in a guilty pleasure sort of way but all in all the direction with everything was pretty terrible.

Mediocre or not, I've seen all of them countless times, this one included. I don't consider this movie to be the atrocity that many say it is, but it certainly is a major disappointment in every way. They had the potential to give Freddy a major send-off that people would never forget. I've never understood why they didn't bring back Alice (Lisa Wilcox) from parts 4/5. She had a son named Jacob in the fifth movie, why not continue that storyline? This could have been the send-off Freddy fans deserved, but Rachel Talalay made sure that didn't happen. She is a big part of the problem. She has a lack of experience and it shows. Like the 4th and 5th sequel, this movie fails to find the proper medium between comedy and horror. This series was beginning to wear out its welcome at this juncture and a proper follow-up would have been ideal. This was not only an insult to Freddy's legacy, but the fans as well. How could you show so much contempt from such a die-hard fan base? As much as I love Robert Englund, he started getting bigger than the movie themselves in the 3rd movie. As a result, the quality went down and the character development was nowhere near as strong. They got into the bad habit of having a penchant to make money with little effort as possible. You want an example? There is a dream scene with Spencer (Breckin Meyer) , where Freddy plays video games (What do you know? Beat my high score! I have to admit I love that line) The point is that this sort of thing doesn't belong in a Nightmare on Elm Street movie. The storyline of Who is Freddy's kid had all the potential in the world to be something special, but it was done in a half-assed way. They try to be clever by pulling a stunt from Psycho with the lead male character, but it wound up hurting the movie more than anything else. The gore is average. we get self-lacerations, a cut off ear, but the highlights are an impaling on spikes and a body exploding in half. We get the same desecrated house that started in Nightmare on Elm Street III Dream Warriors, but you're telling me you couldn't get the original house back? This was supposed to be the final chapter, laziness is not acceptable. I can't forget the lame 3D at the end either. Trust me. The 3D glasses don't make much of a difference. The acting ranges from solid to mediocre. Lisa Zane is somewhat wooden as the heroine. She goes from an afterthought to the main character in the second half and I didn't buy it. It was shoddily written. Another dimension to her character would have been nice. She had too many off moments for my liking. Believe it or not, her storyline had potential as well. It all ended very anti-climatically and half-baked. Robert Englund is fun as usual, but far too comedic at times. His one-liners are awful in this one. ('I'll get you my pretty and your little soul, too!) (Nice hearing from you Carlos!) I love Freddy when he's funny, but not completely funny. A balance of both is essential. He is human in this film at times as well. That's another storyline they failed to capitalize on. Shon Greenblat is decent as John Doe, but we don't know enough about him. It would have been nice to know where he came from and who he was. Lezlie Deane is one of the most annoying horror characters I have ever seen. It's not her fault, just the way she is written. Her abrasive character does her no favors, nor does her Karate shtick either. How the hell did she get to survive? Her phony tough act grated my nerves a LOT. Breckin Meyer is fun as a stoner, while Rickey Dean Logan is solid as Carlos. Yaphett Kotto's role is completely out-of-place in this movie. He felt painfully awkward as the Doc. We get some horrible cameos from Alice Cooper, Rosanne & Tom Arnold. I did enjoy Johnny Depp's cameo though. It's a sad day when Freddy is defeated by Ninja stars and other lame weapons. I don't hate this movie, but it angers me at the same time. When it comes to final chapters you should do everything possible to reward your loyal fans. They failed to do that in this movie. There were a few story lines that had the ability to be riveting, but it failed in all of them. This sequel can be brainless entertainment if you turn your brain off, but it's not a good movie.

He ends up being taken for a drug addict and is thrown into some type of juvenile detention center where he meets the new group of Freddy scenes.The nightmares are absurd and, as I heard on Now Playing podcast very Looney Tunesesque. They did seem like they were targeting to a young audience and so had to keep it clean, simple, and funny. The only good line is when the old lady says Don't be a pussy!.

Meanwhile there are troubled young people planning to run away from their shelter, Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) was made deaf in one ear by abuse from his parents, Tracy (Lezlie Deane) had her father sexually abusing her, and Spencer (Breckin Meyer) just doesn't want to have anything to do with his father's lifestyle. John becomes a resident at the shelter and is cared for by Dr. Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane), he has amnesia and she suggests, finding a newspaper clipping on him, using it to jog his memory and return to where he came from, with Carlos, Tracy and Spencer as stowaways. Visiting Springwood Orphanage it is revealed that Freddy Krueger had a child of his own, John is sure he is that child because he has been allowed to live in his dreams, but of course this turns out to be false when he is killed, and the child is revealed to actually be a daughter. Maggie does some more investigating on who could be the missing child, while one by one Freddy is killing those from the shelter in their dreams, and he is shocked to discover, on fer found adoption papers, that she is the daughter of the killer. Doc (Yaphet Kotto) is a man who can control his dreams, and he discovers that Freddy can kill people in their dreams because he was given powers by the dream demons, and this also explains how he comes back to life, so he can only be stopped by being brought into the real world and killed by someone close to him. Maggie knows that she will have to enter the dream world to confront and bring out Freddy into the real world, and there she sees the past life of Freddy's mind, where he was teased as a child, abused by his foster father, self harmed himself as a teenager, and murdered his own wife. Maggie manages to pull Freddy from the dream realm during a struggle, they fight vigorously until she takes off his glove of razors, and she stabs him in the chest with it, and then a bomb is put in his chest and away from them he explodes, and the demons are seen flying away, Maggie smiles and says Freddy's Dead.

Englund is only slightly back on form for what could have been his final time playing the part of the iconic psycho, the deaths are not all that great, even what is meant to be the final death of Freddy is terrible, the 3D element that was put in at the time is useless, and the story is only a little bit interesting, I thank goodness the Wes Craven film three years later improved things because this is almost a waste of time, it is a big let down and a silly horror sequel.

It's an extremely difficult one to rate because like Stephen King's Thinner critically it deserves a categoric 1/10 for it being absolutely one of the worst films I've ever seen in terms of acting, screenplay, directing, special effects etc. However, we've all heard of the old clichÃ© 'it's so bad it's good' and this directly applies to Freddy's Dead. I had an absolute ball watching this film and it had me in stitches from start to finish.Freddy's Dead features some of the worst deaths imaginable. And I don't mean that in a gruesome way, I mean that in a really crazy/weak idea way! I mean Freddy playing with a deaf boys hearing is pretty un-PC in the first place, but the way it's executed is one of the funniest things I've ever seen! Why would dropping a pin from a great height onto metal be something torturous? It only gets worse when Freddy begins to claw a chalk board with his iconic knife hand! It is brilliant. It only gets funnier when a boy is transported into some sort of Sega video game which Freddy controls. You can only imagine how bad that turns out.However, these death scenes actually become something truly memorable because of how unintentionally hilariously bad they are! All of the characters are completely wooden and the script is one of the cheesiest things I've heard. The directing is equally as awful and the dream sequences are completely incomprehensible, it is literally impossible to tell what is going on. It doesn't help by the horrendously awful special effects that resemble something more from the early 60's than 90's! Some of the animation is absolutely atrocious, as is the make-up effects. The original's effects were far better than this! The final showdown is equally as terrible. It's such a pathetic fight scene, I can't believe they even bothered to film it! Although it doesn't help that Freddy has been camper than ever screaming lines such as You give it back you bitch! and giving pathetic punches to his own daughter. The screenplay also decides to break its own rules throughout to which you just have to let it go and enjoy the entertaining mess which caresses your screen.It's obvious from the ending that the film makers really did want this to be the final sequel, but thank God it wasn't! Because what a terrible end for someone as iconic as Freddy. The writing is so lazy that it decides to take the ideas from the first film about killing Freddy, only this time it works. It's awful. Luckily when Wes Craven came in for a new sequel with New Nightmare it was actually a really good film, the final Freddy film to date Freddy Vs Jason was also a particularly fun instalment. So Freddy isn't dead, but a horrendously bad sequel lives on. I laughed until my sides hurt, but you might react differently. My advice is to take it as it comes!

Granted, it was the first Freddy movie I saw (then I watched Part 1), so it has the nostalgia factor going for it. I remember seeing ads for it on the old Viewer's Choice pay-per-view previews and finally getting up the guts to check it out at the video store.I think what makes it work for me is a few things - You get a ton of back-story on Freddy that actually is quite effective and creepy, especially the scenes of his room with all the newspaper clippings and such. The whole idea of him killing his wife right in front of his daughter and then menacingly threatening her (as any child molesting killer might likely do) really bothered me as well.- In general, most of the dream sequences with the exception of a few are pretty imaginative and surrealistic, even though most of them take a decidedly bugs bunny turn by the end (i.e. the creepy isolated bus depot and Robert Shaye cameo that ends up turning into a Road Runner cartoon, or Tracy laying a beat down on her Dad only for him to pop back up in the silliest of moments).- The awesome video montage at the end, but that goes without saying.- The time period. First off, I love the soundtrack. It captures the feeling of the emerging alternative rock music scene and the simultaneous rediscovering of classic late 60s-early 70s rock music. Plus, all of the characters carry themselves with that very Gen-X, early 1990s hipster chip on their shoulder attitude. They throw the sarcasm back and forth and seem generally unimpressed with each other and with Freddy. It's quite dated now, but it brings me back to that period and so I like that aspect of it a lot. The kids in Part 2-4 in particular just feel so stereotypically yuppie 80s and New Nightmare is about grown ups, so it's nice to get a look into how the so called slacker generation would interact with Freddy.There IS a lot of lame stuff. The 3D, Freddy as the wicked witch of the west, the power glove etc... but I'd argue that at least they go ALL out here with the bad jokes. Part IV and V just don't work for me because he's trying too hard to be in both worlds and just comes off flat in both. Both of those movies sort of bore me, where this one is a lot of fun to let wash over you.

Yes they force a daughter into the story, yes Freddy distinctly has lost his horror edge and is more of a comedy killer BUT the film also adds an interesting desolate twist by setting this film sometime in the unknown future where Freddy has succeeded in killing every child of Elm Street and in Springwood. We get to see just a little more of Freddy's twisted past and I give them kudos for continuing to try and keep a horror series fresh. While the concept could come across as completely silly (the 3D segment was definitely silly) it does actually pull itself together and remain entertaining.Lisa Zane plays Dr. Maggie Burroughs, and Freddy's daughter unbeknownst to her. Zane is decent but I always find her performance in the character a little dry. She is essentially the scream queen and lead female in the film and for that she's a little down played. Shon Greenblatt does a terrific job as the mysterious 'John Doe.' I think he shines in his lead role and steals the scenes. Lezlie Deane, Ricky Dean Logan, and Breckin Meyer round out the main cast and they are all good in their roles while no one really stands out particularly though I did enjoy Meyer's character a lot. Robert Englund of course returns as Freddy and this is probably the film where he seems the least 'scary' and has really gone full blown comedy but still he embodies the crazy lunatic. He is still the reason for the show so to speak.In her movie premier Rachel Talalay seemed to really care about the series (having scrapped an original script for this one) I sound like I'm defending this film and I'm not...its not perfect...the series has certainly gone a long ways from being the freaky and gory world Wes Craven created but I feel like the film makers try very hard to keep the series fresh and unique.

I was shaking to my core, both from the prospect of being caught and the prospect of seeing (as I thought at the time, how naive of me) the end of a horror icon. With a final reel in 3-D too. How could it fail? Well, where to begin? First of all, if you're a fan of the more serious entries in this franchise then this outing is certainly one to avoid. Freddy is most definitely a razor-gloved jester in this movie and the death scenes are played more for laughs than any visceral scares. Luckily, some of the humour IS funny (Johnny Depp's cameo is one particularly chucklesome moment) but only if you disengage the relevant number of braincells. Then there's the 3-D stuff in the final reel, it all felt a bit dated and contrived even when it was first released and doesn't improve with age. The acting side of things? While the likes of Breckin Meyer, Ricky Dean Logan and Lezlie Deane do the disposable teen thing okay it's a shame that the nominal lead is played by Lisa Zane, who seems to think she's waiting for her turn acting in Law & Order (all scowls, seriousness and affected slight superiority).The story is just an excuse for Freddy to kill more kids until the climactic battle although there are some enjoyable scenes showing a bit more background to our clawed killer, fleshing out the young man who would become such a legendary horror. And everything is helped/hindered by some star cameos from the likes of Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold and even Vincent Furnier (some guy who goes by the name of Alice Cooper at times).Despite the pre-release hype and excitement, the tie-ins and merchandising (I even bought the first issue of the comic released at the time, subsequently lost and surely worth a few quid, natch) director Rachel Talalay provides us with a rather flat affair and things feel like they're just being put through the motions. It would have been a disappointing end for Freddy but, as I should have known at the time, nobody was really going to slay the burned, scarred goose while it kept laying golden eggs.See this if you like A Nightmare On Elm Street The Dream Child, A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 The Dream Master, Trick Or Treat.

I had never seen any Nightmare on Elm Street film until just recently. I have to say, that up to this point, I'm a fan. But, after seeing Freddy's Dead, I just have to wonder what the writers were on when they made this atrocity. 1. There was none of the 1, 2, Freddy's coming for you... nursery rhyme that I so adored in the first 5 installments. I felt that was a key element to creating the atmosphere in these movies. 2. The music did absolutely nothing for the film. The atmosphere was not there at all, and I felt like I was watching a purposely bad horror movie. (which, may I add that I love cheesy horror films, but expected a little more from this particular franchise) 3. Although the story line had great potential, it was too random to truly follow or create any bond between the viewer and the character. I was stoked to find that Freddy had a daughter, only to be let down by the revelation that it was the zombie like director (or whatever she was) at the teens facility. I was hoping it was going to be the teenage girl, I know it was supposed to be a shocker, but I just felt left down. 4. Freddy is using a video game to bounce Breckin Myer around a living room and up the stairs? Craptastic. 5. The pins dropping sequence was so cartoon-y I could hardly stand it!I did laugh my butt off, but not exactly the movie I was hoping for. I did however enjoy the woman in the orphanage talking to the non-existent children, actually fairly creepy. Tonight...New Nightmare...hope its better than this one! "},{"Title":"Freddy really IS Dead!","Date":"12 August 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" When I was younger, this was one of my favorite movies, I'd watch it about 3 times a day, along with Waxwork. But now that I'm older, it's easy to see that this movie is a complete mess. Rather then picking up where we left off with The Dream Child, everything is avoided for this disaster. After no build up, we're shown Freddy again within the first couple minutes, flying on a broom like the wicked witch from Wizard of Oz, oohhhhhh scary...then we see him driving a tour bus No screaming while the bus is in motion. Yup, easy to tell, this is going to be a long ugly ride.So this takes place 10 years in to the future, from 1991, so I guess it's suppose to take place in 2001, and all the Springwood children have been killed...by Freddy of course. Not exactly how we remember things from the last entry. There is one remaining Elm Street child who is forced in to a halfway house/shelter by Freddy (lol). And this last survivor seems to have amnesia after hitting his head on a rock, so he can't remember anything about his past or where he came from, all he knows is if he falls asleep, he ain't waking up. Of course there are other kids at the shelter, and they become wrapped up in to things shortly after.There is also a twist added for this one, as the story just isn't strong enough without it. This twist being that Freddy has a daughter, and she works at the same shelter where this John Doe is now staying! To help him remember his past, Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane as Freddy's Daughter) brings him back to Springwood, which is basically a ghost town now since all the children were murdered and families moved away. While on the way there, we find that 3 kids from the shelter were hiding in the back of the van, so it looks like they're a part of the team now.This movie really pushes the limits on the gimmicks as there are tons of cameos from Roseanne, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper. The only one I didn't mind seeing was Johnny Depp, as he was one of Freddy's original victims, back when Freddy was a monster and not a comedian. Speaking of Freddy as a comedian, there's really no other way to describe him in this. He lost everything that made him scary, and does nothing but bust jokes, unfunny ones at that. This is Freddy at Rock bottom.There's only one good death scene, and that being Carlos' (Ricky Dean Logan) who happens to be deaf. Freddy gives him a custom hearing aid, that is ultra sensitive to noise, and Freddy makes as much ruckus as possible until Carlos' head completely blows up. Then there's the video game death of Spencer (Breckin Meyer), where he's sucked in to the television and Freddy controls him through his power glove (oh jeez). I don't know what I was on as a kid, but I use to consider that as one of my favorite deaths, now it's almost unbearable to watch. And the sound effects when his body is bouncing around the house is just pathetic. One death, that I was surprised about, was the death of our John Doe. At least, the makers had some balls by doing this as he was one of the leads throughout the first half of the movie.This movie also acts as bit of a prequel, showing some of Freddy's home life before he was burned alive. We shown this as Freddy lets the viewers know It's Traveling time! Thanks for the update Freddy! At least it's good to see Robert Englund without the make-up for a bit, since the plastic he wears throughout is just horrible.Oh, I almost forgot about the 3D gimmick. It's just terrible, as we see Maggie wear the cardboard glasses and we're shown ridiculous special effects like the dream sperm demons who gave the Freddy the power who control Nightmares. I never really liked this idea, as I feel it makes the series seem cheap. Should have brought in the Dream Police or whatever else they had planned because this simply didn't work.So Maggie must bring Freddy in to the real world to defeat him. Not a bad idea, but it worked much better in the original and FVJ. His death in this one just didn't work for me, a few ninja stars (ya, ninja stars) and a bomb to the chest finishes him off, really running out of ideas now arn't we. I did like the flashback of Freddy throughout the series once he is blown up, a nice touch. Kinda sad how one of the things I like about this movie is when they show flashbacks of the other movies though.In conclusion, this is the low point in the series, and ended things weakly. Thank God, we were given New Nightmare, as this was the wrong way to go out and should have never been made. It's a Freddy movie for kids...er...for when I was a kid, I doubt the kids of today would even appreciate this. This movie does take me back, but with that said, it should be left there. One good death, and a little extra back story make me give this one a...4/10 "},{"Title":"Entertaining but silly","Date":"4 February 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" I have to say that I think they picked a good time to wind down the Freddy movies because by this sixth installment the franchise was seriously out of puff.Freddy Krueger is back and he's a happy boy having achieved his ambition of killing off all of the teenagers from Springfield, and is now using John Doe (Shon Greenblatt) to reel his daughter in so he can expand his territory summed up with one line Every town has an Elm Street. That's right Freddy has a daughter, Maggie Burroughs, played by Lisa Zane, and he wants her to join with him. Maggie gets a plan, goes inside Freddys head for a 3-D finale, drags him into the real world and finishes him off with a pipe bomb.There's some good comic moments here, some creative kills and it's not a terrible movie, merely a lazy and unnecessary one. "},{"Title":"Get out of my dreams.","Date":"17 October 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" If A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child left the bag open, then Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is the stale chips we are forced to eat. At the turn of the 90's, slasher films were quickly going out of fashion and the in-thing to do was to kill off your villain. It's a noble idea, especially since the last Nightmare flick from the 80's left a bad taste in just about everyone's mouth. However, if you plan on sending off such an iconic pop-culture figure as Freddy Krueger, shouldn't you do it in a way that respects the fans and leaves them yearning for more? Afterall, that's the game that is played in this genre. Step one tell them it's ending. Step two rake in record box office receipts. Step three resurrect said franchise to quench the thirst of the fan-base. Step four rake in even more dough. Funny, isn't it, that all these years later, this is the last of the 'true' Freddy sequels we have seen? Perhaps that's a testament to the load of crap that is Freddy's Dead. In all fairness, there are aspects to the movie that make it worth watching at least once. As for this fan, well, I'm just too ashamed to admit how many times I've sat through this, though.To her credit, first time director Rachel Talalay (who served as line-producer for the bulk of the franchise) shows some skill behind the camera, but it is the abomination of a script we are served and the execution in which it is delivered that sinks this ship. Bad dialogue is bad enough without bad actors spewing it, but this film has plenty of both to go around. There isn't much of a story to tell, either, as we spend the 90 minutes of the film waiting for Freddy to bite the dust. One thing, however, that this movie has going for it is that it reveals a bit more of Freddy's back-story, as we get to see Robert Englund play the Freddy Krueger that existed before he entered the dream world. But then, points like these are ruined when things like The Dream Demons (who closely resemble a certain reproductive matter) are introduced. Elsewhere, the nightmare sequences -- a trademark of the series as a whole -- are downright stupid, and not to mention, drawn out. Unless you find Looney Tunes, power-gloves (as in Nintendo Power Glove) and The Wizard Of Oz scary, you won't find much of interest here. Granted, after six films, it's hard to make Freddy scary, but they take it to a whole new level of lameness with the cheesy one-liners Freddy spews. Truth be told, he resembles Bugs Bunny more than he resembles a son of a hundred maniacs. And boy, let's not get started on that 3D sequence that closes the film. It's bad enough that Freddy is finished off in a bland, anti-climatic way, but it looks cheesy to boot. The 3D doesn't work, and like ninety-percent of the film, it's a gimmick.Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is the lowest point in the series, but at least they had the good sense to end it there. I rate it four out of ten, and that's being generous. The back-story is fair, and the cameos from the likes of Roseanne, Alice Cooper and Nightmare alum, Johnny Depp, will grab your attention and most likely render a chuckle. Also, and I have to be honest, the film is visually very appealing and well made. It's just a shame there's virtually nothing below the surface. Watch this movie because it finishes the series and take comfort knowing that it doesn't get any worse than this.

From Dream Warriors onward, the movies focused on the same characters; yet at the beginning of this movie there isn't one familiar face besides Freddy. Another thing that annoys me is that Freddy's victims just disappear from the real world when killed in the dream world. That makes sense, since that didn't happen in the other 5 previous titles. The death scenes in this movie are ridiculous. I assume they were going for creativity, but this is just stupid. One of the characters dies while in a video game. Remember the power glove from the NES days? Yeah, Freddy has one, and hes not afraid to use it. I know, thats a scary thought. Speaking of which, I was too young to remember this movie coming out in '91, but I'm going to assume it was marketed as a horror film. That's just plain hilarious. There's nothing scary about this movie except for the fact that it's 96 minutes long. If you have the nerve to start this film, at least make it until the end.

I watched the encyclopedia DVD, and Racheal Talalay claimed that she has to make the end suitable for the 3D effects for a movie gimmick, Racheal didn't want this but New Line did. That decision probably altered the movie, but the movie was originally going to have Tayrn, Kincaid, and Joey as dream polices, but that was just stupid. The movie has some untrained actors, and no real gross death scenes, which make the series legendary, where in this film, the characters barely knew who Freddy was, and they just started having nightmares about him, unlike the characters from parts 1-3 who have already been dreaming about him. The movie could use big time improvement, as far as I know, this movie was a waste of good money.

It expands on his past and his making, which I feel was interesting, but went just a little too far. It left very little to the imagination and I felt it went way too far into depth and gave too many visuals. Freddy's kills become very funny, such as putting someone in a video game, he even mimics the witch in the Wizard of Oz. It was very action oriented and was not quite the head trip that fans of Freddy are used to. It was interesting to see a Nightmare on Elm Street movie opening with music by The Goo Goo Dolls, as well as their music reoccurring on and off in the film. This movie is only one that you want to watch if you need to fill your appetite for more Freddy and are willing to laugh while doing it...an odd combination...but it is what they filmed, so quit complaining and accept it!

They make amazingly frightening movies, but then the movies are ruined by sequel after sequel. The only good part was the Freddy 101, but even that was weird.

Aside from some nice (or at least far less cheesy) Freddy lines--and one or two interesting flashbacks--near the end (everything before and up to the horrific Nintendo sequence is trash), and ONE truly good scene between Freddy and Yaphet Kotto, the doctor, the movie was simply awful, an insult even to the rest of the campy (but fun) series. Most frustrating was the final battle, which had endless potential (see my message board topic, what should have happened), but was reduced to just one more fight with all the epic drama of eggnog.

Sadly, that isn't so. The story goes that Freddy's pretty much turned Springwood into a ghost town, and so he has to find new victims elsewhere. His vessel is John Doe, who apparently is the last surviving teenager from the town. He has amnesia and ends up in a halfway home for troubled kids, where they take him in. The young doctor Maggie decides to take him back to Springwood, and three other kids jump along for the ride as stowaways. When they get there they bump into Roseanne and Tom Arnold (no kidding!) at a pretty spooky town fair before heading off to Freddy's house. They of course decide that this is a great place for a nap, and each find their own room to lie in. The usual happens to them, and the remaining kids head back to the halfway house with Freddy along for the ride. There the final battle against Freddy takes place, and his death leaves no question that he's not getting back up from that one! Part of what saves this movie from being a complete dud is that the kills are both inventive and well pulled off, plus we get some good back-story that helps us understand some of where Freddy's anger is coming from. Johnny Depp's little cameo is a nice touch as well (especially considering his past) and having Yaphet Kotto in a horror movie is never a bad idea.

That one kid is allowed to live just long enough to find Freddy's long-lost child. Then, everything builds up to the Freddy's death and the grand finale&#133; &#133; which really sucks.The story and direction come from Rachel Talaly, who seems to have a very cartoonish imagination. In some films, that would work wonderfully. The atmosphere here is something like Looney Toones as made by David Cronenburg. In theory, that'd be pretty cool in a comic-book movie.And, for a while, it actually works it. It's totally unhinged and seriously demented. To be honest, I kind of liked the wild insanity at times. The odd sense of humor makes it sort of fun. It also makes it feel like a different film; it doesn't feel like a copycat of the previous films.But it goes on forever. In between dreams, it drags, and when it gets to the dreams, they manage to be weird but not suspenseful or creepy. They're somewhat imaginative, but not enough. Sometimes they kind of work for a little while, but most of them are failures. The video game sequence is just plain stupid, and most of them aren't much better. On top of that, Freddy has more one-liners than all the other films combined --- yes, even more than he had in part 4 --- and every single one of them is absolutely lame. And never is anything even remotely creepy in the film.But it might have been at least somewhat worthwhile if Freddy's inevitable death had been cool. But it isn't. His death in any of the other films in the series would have been better --- destroyed with holy water, torn apart by the souls he has taken, taken away by his mother, castrated and burned alive, or, best of all, what happened in the original he isn't feared anymore. What happens here, though, is just dull. The entire climax just falls absolutely flat. Even Part 2 would have been a more satisfying end for the series. While the other poor ones are frustrating, I genuinely wish this one never existed.Although, Johnny Depp does have a 15-second cameo that was pretty funny. And Breckin Meyer was amusing as a stoner.But man, why couldn't they have found any better way to end the regular series? I mean, honestly, Freddy vs. Jason was more satisfying, and it didn't even have a frickin' ending! Now, you know what's really sad about this film? It's still better than 99.9% of slasher films.

In an attempt to give Talalay some credit, there were definitely some new ideas presented here, and the Nintendo sequence was a lot of fun. That's about all I can think of, however, as the rest of the movie was really bad.

Well, in the 80's, everyone knew Freddy Krueger. He was one of the top slashers on the silverscreen at the time and as the star of all of the Nightmare on Elm Street films, he topped the box-office, time and time again, much to the disgust of critics worldwide. However successful the films were, they always maintained some sense of dignity, at least one little beam of darkness that still remained from the original. Freddy's Dead, however, is the complete commercialization of Freddy. This movie could have been easily promoted by having Freddy linked to fast-food chains like McDonald's with Happy Meals that come with 8 different Freddy characters from Freddy's Dead (Nintendo Freddy! Witch Freddy! Bus Driver Freddy! Child Molesting Father Freddy! Collect them all!) and burgers with patties in the shape of Freddy's face. Maybe I'm getting a little carried away with this. Overall, what I'm trying to say is that what little horror element that once remained in the films is completely obliterated here. Freddy has become an impersonator in this movie. He is simply not scary at all and just provides comic relief to a really lousy script involving a kid with amnesia, a couple mental patients and Freddy's sister (!). The way Freddy meets his supposed demise is just lame and isn't worth mentioning on this page. The only thing that helps this movie is some interesting backstory to Freddy represented through actual scenes as opposed to just stories (which alone might make this a worthy watch to see) and some odd cameos by Roseanne & Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who was made a star by the first flick) and Alice Cooper, as Freddy's abusive foster-father.

Don't take it seriously and you might enjoy it.  I'm a die-hard Freddy fan and have been for years.  I remember when this first came out, I was mortally offended by how cheap and nasty this film was.However, being a Freddy fan I did buy it on video and promptly forgot about it.  Hey, it looked nice on my shelf, it didn't mean I had to watch it. Then one night I was bored of everything I had, so I put it on.  I have never laughed so much in my life.  The video game sequence is in my top 10 of comedy moments, hotly followed by the highly believable wounds that the John Doe received moments before his death.  Also the Nothing is making me get off this bed moment was deeply funny.  I have to rewind and watch again when I get to that part.  (But that might just be my fixation on the John Doe showing).Another amusing thing is that I read an interview with someone about this film, it might well have been Rachel Talalay, but I could be wrong. Anyway, the person in question was quoted as saying something along the lines of `this is probably the darkest Nightmare we've ever done.  It's very hard to see the humour in this film'.  I have a suggestion for that person, open your eyes when you watch.The story is passable, although the long lost daughter is a bit laughable. But then again, it's obligatory in the horror genre to have a long lost relative pop up when the sequels are dying.  Yaphet Kotto's character Doc makes me want to scream.  Ok, so he's a dream doctor, but does he have to smugly know everything?  So there's two Mary Sue strikes against the story.The acting again is passable.  I hated Maggie, but that's a personal thing, her voice annoyed me.  Yaphet Kotto (Doc) was flat and boring.  The teenagers were good and Robert Englund could play Freddy standing on his head.So it's not a terrible movie.  However, what I loved about the first movie was how terrifying Freddy was.  He was barely ever seen, and was horrifically brutal, but in this film he quips his way through killings. If that's the real Freddy he missed his calling in life, he shouldn't have been a janitor-turned-child-killer, but a cheesy host on a cheap talk or game show.I'd give this film 2/10 as a &#145;Freddy' film, but about 4/10 if you try to think of it as a stand-alone film.If you're an obsessive Freddy fan, watch it drunk, it will take the sting away.

After endless sequels of Freddy Krueger terrorizing teenagers in the dream world, New Line finally decided that the series had run its course. However, this decision seems to have been made a sequel or so late, since the sixth Nightmare is the worst of the series. Previous films had been guilty of making Freddy into a comic antihero, but this one takes it to absurd extremes. Rarely is there a scare to be found in Freddy's Dead; not only are the kills few and far in-between, but they're so farcical, so broadly played, that they elicit howls of laugher. At times, the nightmares are so cartoonish, one is reminded of the exploits of Wile E. Coyote. The video game sequence, for example, is absolutely priceless...but wasn't the Wes Craven original a semiserious suburban horror movie? And what the hell is Roseanne doing here? It's only a cameo, yes, but an awfully distracting one at that.Does anything in the movie work? Yes, the flashbacks to Freddy's past are actually pretty interesting, although these dream worms or whatever they are never very convincing, the concept being sorely underdeveloped. The whole long-lost daughter/relative think is a bit of a clichÃ©. Remember Michael's niece? Jason's sister? Well, I guess it had to happen sooner or later. Freddy's demise? The climax is little more than a display of cheap violence, and the part about the 3-D glasses must be seen to be believed. Wasn't that just a passing fad that came and left in 1983? No matter, it's just a desperate gimmick to make a few ticket/video sales.The performances are adequate, given the circumstances, although most of the teenage characters rarely generate sympathy for their fate; they're just fodder for Freddy's ghoulish bag of trick-and-treats. Yaphet Kotto is wooden; he must have taken the job just because he needed the money. And it goes without saying that at this point, Robert Englund can play Freddy in his sleep. First time director Rachel Talalay gives it her best, making it look as good as it probably could be under the circumstances, but the poor script dooms her valiant efforts.

What I don't like was the staleness of the nightmare sequences.  I preferred earlier movies in the series, where Freddy would wear down a victim until he could kill them.  Here he does it in one dream, and while they are creative (death by Sega, for example), they were over too quickly for my liking, and he only killed in the first half of the movie, which slowed things down.Overall, an okay movie.

If Freddy's Dead had centered more around her than the runaway kids(read obviously doomed Freddy-fodder) the movie would have been greatly improved. Yapet Kotto also plays the role of the dream therapist well, although he like all the actors is not given much to do, other than pontificate on the nature of dreams, and how to get Freddy. The few scenes the two share are the best, as they have- dare I say- a good chemistry together. Their scenes feel REAL in contrast to the cheesy Freddy scenes that really bring the movie down. The special effects are as usual pretty good, even though they invoke a been there done that feeling in anybody who's familiar with the series and seen previous episodes. The soundtrack is a plus for me, as well as the montage at the end, capturing all the best Freddy moments from the series. And at least we got to explore some of his past before he got the 'final' sign off. THE BAD I didn't give a damn whether any of the characters lived or died, which certainly didn't help a terrifically unscary  so-called horror movie. I will consent that most of the actors did a good job ( the girl who plays Tracy reminds me of a young Sigourney Weaver), but their characters were either not very interesting, or just plain annoying. They had nothing to work with, and so sunk. The structure of the film and many of the fx gags were also derriative of parts one and three, excusable since the movie wasn't a total copy, but also a pretty good sign that not much thought was put into this not-quite-final nightmare. *****SPOILER****Add to minus column an end that was already done before in part one (get Freddy out into real world), and also pales before his best death in part four when the souls of his victims all burst out of him.

I've seen it all before, and done better, including some of the first films in the Freddy series.  Freddy isn't scary anymore, so the filmmakers have taken a different route with the character, and tried to make him funny and comedic, especially in the last two Freddy films.  As a horror film, or a sequel to what began as a classic horror film series, this one is crap, same as A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child.  It only works as a comedy, really, and even then, it's not that funny, nor should it be.  After all, Freddy Krueger is not a clown, he's a horribly disfigured demon from hell who kills kids in their dreams.  This culture has turned him into an icon, and even Kindergartners have seen his movies.  What a horrid commentary! However, I will still remember this as the first 3D movie I've ever seen, even though the 3D portion of the movie takes place only in the last fifteen minutes, when Freddy dies, and they use a pitifully awful subplot in which Freddy's daughter Maggie uses cardboard 3D glasses so she can see in something called `Freddyvision.'  You can tell what kind of awful movie this is just from that description, and the effect is completely asinine and ridiculous!  The 3D glasses didn't really work that great for me, and it was difficult for me to concentrate and actually see 3D images, and my eyes were strained, and it seemed almost black and white with very muted colors.  I was not very impressed. They actually did better with the sound in this movie, especially during a scene where Freddy attacks a deaf kid.  Freddy causes the kid's hearing aid to biologically mutate and grow into his ear canal, giving him superhearing. Then he comically pulls out a chalkboard and stretches it out so it's huge, and then begins running his finger-knives over the chalkboard until the kid's head explodes.

You had a whole graduating class that came out in 1989 (look at the tassels onthe graduation hats.) So in two years he would have had to kill all the kids. Another thing to point out is that Alice is no where to be found nor nor even mentioned.

A true horror fan probably will hate this movie, which is evident by the majority of the comments on here. But horror movies are pretty much of a joke anyways, so at least this movie doesn't try to hide the fact it's a joke. I like Freddy much more as a comedian, though I liked him how he was in the first movie too. But the scene with the chalkboard and when he is sneaking up on the guy after he lost his hearing aid were funny in my book. I thought the whole movie had a stupid dream feel to it, which I thought was cool. It's all about Freddy, and funny or serious, he's still cool.  Avoid part 7, though. Still don't know what everyone saw in that one. I give this a 7/10 as far as horror movies go, 4/10 as far as real movies go.

My fondness of Robert Englund's role in his sixth ANOES film didn't save the horribly scripted story and dialog. It was kind of cool seeing Breckin Meyer as a young kid starting out, and it's pretty obvious that the potential was there but his character didn't pan out.

The death's in the previous films were ridiculous and stupid but this one has the video game death, one of the worst horror film deaths ever. Not only that but Freddy, who I commend for being a sarcastic villain, is way too corny in this. He makes a Powerglove reference, he does a Wizard of Oz parody. In the other films he was silly in the context of murdering people, in this one the silliness has been kicked to such a high level it's impossible to see that this series was at any point considered a horror film.I like the idea of humanizing Freddy and showing who he was before he became a monster and showing his turning into a monster, but it falls short because it's too late in the series and the way it is done is awful.

If you said Nightmare 2 or the reboot, you're wrong. Both of those films still had their merits over this one. Freddy's Dead screwed up spectacularly. There isn't one single likable feature of it. And it sucks, because we could have been given so much. There was so much potential in the backstory, so much potential for the supposed grand finale that Freddy's Dead could have been the best film in the series since the third one. The Nightmare series limped along to its death, and Freddy's Dead served to prove that it deserved it.Freddy's Dead gave us visual depictions of Freddy's backstory, and that should have been awesome. It really should have. There was so much to work with, here. Even the reboot provided better cinematography and emotion in the backstory than Freddy's Dead had. This entire film reeks of we don't care anymore, and it's apparent with how short-sighted it is. How wooden and meaningless the backstory scenes are. It provided nothing new, but it didn't have to. We watched because we wanted to see just how well it could be presented to us. Did it give us any wow factor? Did it arise emotion within us? Did it help solidify the development of the characters? It's as if the writers and director didn't want to make a scary or thrilling film. Like they felt the entire series was just a parody of itself, and that Freddy's Dead was just the mercy killing at that point. And perhaps that's true. However, I would certainly expect better of the entire development team than to ACT that way.There's sequels which don't do the series justice, but at least they TRY. The writers TRY to develop something interesting, the director TRIES to implement a vision that is gripping and powerful. Freddy's Dead had none of that. It's as if the development team had never actually SEEN a Nightmare film before. It drifts from phoned-in scene to phoned-in scene with no emotion, no directorial vision, and no interest in the subject matter. It's one big exploration of vapidity. In turn, the audience became completely detached as well. If the development team didn't care, why should we? Perhaps it's too much to ask for a more scary/thrilling Freddy, like we had in the first film. Okay, make him campier like in the sequels. But that doesn't excuse the half-assed writing or emotionless directing. If it weren't for the gore and language, you would swear that this is a made-for-TV film directed towards adolescents. I say that because we're all familiar with that style of writing, directing, and acting. It's never deep, because why should it be? Nobody ever takes made-for-TV movies seriously, and that includes the development team.That's what this entire film feels like Here's a made-for-TV blowoff that I have to crank out before they let me direct a real film. I guess it's a hard pill to swallow for what was at the time, meant to be the final chapter for one of horror's most endearing icons.Not even Robert Englund could save this one. I hate this film, and I can't imagine why anyone would ever like it. It's not just a bad Nightmare film, it's a bad film in general.

We all start this sixth stage in our trip in a plane and then the nightmare comes. The boy finds himself in a teenage shelter, in other words a prison for teenagers because Freddy's target is the female psychiatrist. They all believe the boy is Freddy's son. Wrong again. The boy is only the caretaker of one mission  bring the female psychiatrist to Springwood which is only two miles away. There Freddy will get three more victims, all boys. He definitely is a male-child molester more than a female-child abuser. But this time, with the help of another psychiatrist, male and black, the woman is going to get into Freddy's head, which is possible because she is his daughter and she has plenty of common recollections with him. She gets him out of the dreamscape in which he is protected and overpowerful and gets him into the real world where he is mortal. The final fight will lead to his absolute annihilation with his own claws and a good old stick of dynamite, his own penetrating and raping tools turned back onto him with the penis-like dynamite stick as a cherry to top it of, and he finally loses his cherry. The film though is more interesting than just that. First it is modern, it has grown up along with the world and we have electronic games, colour TV, consoles of all types, hearing aids and many other modern gadgets. Second it has also followed the growth of teenagers as an age group and the teenagers in the film are from our modern time  they are definitely rebellious, have been marginalized by drugs and many other things, including the abuse from their parents, and are now controlled by the police and other judicial institutions for delinquent teenagers. They are at least neurotic and can become psychotic in a minute, in the wink of a dream, when the real world becomes virtual, dreamlike, or even inexistent. But the film enables us to discover Freddy in his real life. He was married and had a daughter and yet at the same time had been the victim of adults and had developed a complete tolerance to any suffering. And here Rachel Talalay plays with us and introduces a blue-beard recollection in Freddy's daughter's discovering her father's torture chamber. Finally the technique used in the film has been updated to all kinds of modern special effects. This sixth episode though wants to be the end of the saga in its title and in its closing scene and song, though the last picture is still one of Freddy himself standing upright on his feet.

Worth noting is how the numbers on the elm street house say 1427 elm street, when it should read 1428 & despite being closed up for many years, the Elm street house still has power! ROBERT ENGLUND is still fun to watch, but I think even he knew the series days were numbered, you can see it in his performance. The film chucks out many themes & rules made in the previous films between fantasy & reality as well. RACHEL TALALY who worked on many of the previous NIGHTMARE movies, has no talent at all when it comes to direction. Her direction is all over the place & it's no surprise that along with this & TANK GIRL & GHOST IN THE MACHINE, she disappeared from the feature film world. She approaches the material like she's making a cartoon & as a result many things that could have made for an intriguing & perhaps better instalment in the franchise winds up way to hammy to take seriously. The film touches upon many themes, not explored previously, such as incest, child abuse etc. but while these could have been intriguing avenues to explore for the series, the sad fact is, this to is handled with a campy & downright silly attitude that completely sinks it & the special effects aren't up to series par. Billed as the final instalment what started out as a truly terrifying series of horror films, with genuine suspense & terror & tension & a truly terrifying villain was sadly & crudely abandon as the series went on & this fact was none the more evident than it was here, I never cared for the fact that Freddy was married & had a daughter, somehow this made him even less scarier. I always thought he was much more scarier when one assumed he was just a loner his whole life. The level of bad puns, jokes & silliness abounded. The teen characters were none to likable & the 3D effects weren't very well done either. Some of the kills were also on the silly side including one character falling asleep & dreaming he is trapped in a video game with his overbearing father. Freddy who is in complete control of the youth's actions in the dream & game world, thanks to his power glove (don't ask) which he uses to cause the teen to bounce up & done & punch through walls like Super Mario & another kids head explodes when Freddy gives him a super sensitive hearing aid! whats more, Freddy never uses his razor fingered glove to kill anyone & a couple of the other kills seen in the film is played for laughs! Speaking of the body count, it's low with the kills being unimaginative & as already mentioned, silly. The film sets up a number of good cameo's though in funny bit parts, ROSANNE & TOM ARNOLD as residents of Springwood, who's children were killed by Freddy. ALICE COOPER as Freddy's abusive alcoholic step dad, that winds up as one of Freddy's first victims when Freddy was a disturbed (& I do mean disturbed!) teen. JOHNNY DEPP returning from the original in a funny Anti-drug commercial made by Freddy etc. & the characters were more interesting & fleshed out than they were in previous instalments & I liked the idea of Freddy's victims being erased from everyone's memories, with the exception of his daughter, her friend a psychiatrist working at the youth centre & a troubled teen who got caught up in the supernatural going on's. All in all FREDDY'S DEAD THE FINAL NIGHTMARE, has many amusing moments & the film tends to explore much of Freddy's past than any of the prior sequels did & even gives us a reason why Freddy keeps coming back (he has three powerful dream demons inside him that has given him eternal powers) & how he now has the powers to spread his evil world wide after killing off the last elm street kid of the parents who torched him, who themselves have lost their minds, acting childlike & seeing imaginary kids all around them in Springwood which has no more children left. But as stated it's not scary & is to dumb to be funny. It's better than Part 5, but sadly not by much, in fact if I were to name this sequel anything, I would name it as a guilty pleasure. By this point, the series was more or less a dark comedy & thankfully would be the last Kruger venture to be so. Great score & rock soundtrack. Followed by NEW NIGHTMARE & the direct sequel to this FREDDY VS. JASON.

In doing so, Freddy believes the way will open for him to explore a whole new city and country of kids and their fears. The plot is very interesting, but unfortunately there are far too many jokes, and Freddy is no longer scary. Instead of following the plot, smoothing over the holes, and finding a good complete cast, it relies on effects, which are not very good, and gimmicks- the 3D caper. Englund seems sad that the role he will be remembered for is no longer a horrific and evil character from who it is almost impossible to escape from, to a one-liner giver, and slapstick comedian. Even the flashbacks, which could have been very dark, are not effective. Zane is good, Lezlie Deane is excellent, Depp gives an interesting cameo but the other cameos are average, as are the rest of the cast. Kotto does well in a small part. If only the film had sought to be more like the first- dark, rather than humorous it would have been better. If you want to make a scary film, make it completely devoid of humour. If you want to make a mix of both work well, keep the humour very tongue-in cheek.

An annoyed therapist, Maggie (Lisa Zane) is having her hands full with the kids in her control in a children's shelter when John comes to the shelter, mentally fit but babbling about some weird guy in his dreams who was out to kill him. She becomes fascinated by him, as well as Doc. (Yaphet Koto). She decides to investigate further and brings him with her back to the town of Springwood, the birthplace of Freddy Kruegar. In Springwood, they discover no children in the town, and a conspiracy surrounding Freddy's possible children. Unaware, three followers stumble into Freddy's house and kills them all, toying with each one until they die. Maggie and arrive in time to discover what Freddy is up to regarding his child Freddy possesses Maggie in order to provide him with more souls. Possessed by Freddy, Maggie unknowingly brings him back to the shelter where he begins a giant wave of horror on the unsuspecting staff and patients.The Good News I really want to applaud the film-makers for making this movie so enjoyable. This is my favorite of the sequels, right before 'New Nightmare.' The reason why this one is so good is that Freddy has some of his funniest lines ever in this film. This one is a lot funnier than Part 4, which everyone says is the funniest. The lines though are not obtrusive and add to the enjoyment of the film. They are funny but to the point of enjoyment, but don't cross the delicate line into cheesiness. Even his torturing is far more enjoyable. It is very exciting to see Freddy doing a best of both worlds between his comedy and his horror. Torturing victims one minute then cracking a humorous line the next is very refreshing to see Kruegar do. The supposed 3-D ending is nicely realized, even if the viewer has no glasses to see it. I also like to comment on the plot as well. It is one of the most creative ways to give Freddy a credible reason to come back, as well as allowing Freddy an inventive new way to continue his reign of terror. Perhaps the best example in the series of what a large amount of special effects can do to a film. The kills are probably as creative a bunch as Freddy has ever had, and they are just a joy to watch. They're not really scary, just enjoyable, and the film makes them work quite easily.The Bad News The only bad thing about this movie was how totally non-threatening Freddy was. The make-up didn't make him look very scary, a complete down grade from the previous films where he at least looked menacing. The Final Verdict Completely enjoyable entry for all Freddy fans. It has the best of both worlds very funny lines and a menacing atmosphere all around. Recommended for all fans of Kruegar and slasher fans in general.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and mild drug references.

Rachel Talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise, had been on the production staff and produced even. I don't know what she was thinking, but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance byTom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote/directed this disappointing piece of garbage. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over-glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror, with the contrived use of a 3D ending. Aren't those glasses nifty? And you get to KEEP them! It's the equivalent of, you just spent $9.00 making me rich. Here's 10 cents. Now, don't you feel special!? Sorry, but for me, it just did not make me feel special. And Freddy's had yet another face-lift. This one was for the worst, I think. All the beautiful artistry that went into his look in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics. He looks ... less like the burn victim he is supposed to be, and more like he has a skin disorder. Changing the lead's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor. But wait! They've done that, and done that. So I guess it doesn't matter. But it mattered to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He's just ... another low-rent monster like the Leprechaun. It's more...a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee (sadly, it fell short on both accounts). So there's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh, because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film. It rates a 3.2/10 from...the Fiend .

At least he is good at comedy.  That would be something I would pay to see.  I have seen the first Nightmare about 50 times, I have seen Craven's last one maybe 5 times, the others are just a waste of time and they are not even worth one viewing.  I can't tell you how much I despise the way that horror films have evolved.  From all of the Fridays after the fourth, all the Nightmares after the first and before the last and all the Scream clones, they are mostly terrible.  There have really only been perhaps 3 films in the 90's that scared me.  One was Wes' New Nightmare and the two others are this summer's biggest surprises, that being The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense.  They are movies that scare, chill and make you jump in ways that this and every other Nightmare could only dream of.  If you have a morbid curiosity of what else I think of this film, review A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre along with the other two films that I mentioned.  Then you will see that those films are the exact opposite of what this one if.  And that is a scary thought.  I just hope that horror films are on the rise again seeing as we now have names like Myrick, Sanchez and Shyalaman that have emerged onto the scene.  Perhaps they can bring us back to what horror films used to stand for.  We used to have scares and chills, now we have comedy in place of all that is a horror movie.  If that is your thing then watch this one along with movies like Idle Hands.  But if you are a purist, stay away from this one and go rent some classics.  Thank the movie Gods for video.

Freddy's goal is to create new Elm Streets, and begin a new killing spree after having killed of all of the children in Springwood.Maggie, utilizing new dreams techniques, uncovers Krueger's past, which include being taunted by schoolmates for being the son of 100 maniacs, being cruel to animals, beaten by his stepfather, the murder of his own wife when she discovers he has been killing children and the moment when the Dream Demons arrive in his boiler room to make him the offer of eternal life. Eventually, Maggie pulls Freddy out of the dream world and uses a pipe bomb to blow him up.The story is a little scary, but also funny as heck. It is considered the worst idea for the movie, but it works for me and to say the least, it is the best of A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, for me, along with the 1984 and 2010 versions of the original film, the 2003 crossover film with Jason Voorhees, the fourth film, the third and second film and Wes Craven's New Nightmare.Like I said, the only Nightmare on Elm Street film I have mixed emotions over is A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child.There's not much to say about the visuals and design, but they are incredible as they were back in 1991, when this film came out. The way the comedy and horror works with Freddy is just as impressive and inspiring. The music is just cool as hell. Brian May is a great composer and he done a very great job with the music in the film and the famous original theme is in this film.The acting is a little confusing, but I will give credit to Lisa Zane as Maggie Burroughs / Katherine Krueger. She does a great job and I don't think she could have been worse in any of the scenes in this film. Robert Englund returns as Freddy Krueger and his performances is cool as hell. My favorite scenes are when Freddy tells Maggie, Every town has an Elm Street and the parody of the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz.My favorite nightmare is the video game nightmare and that was really funny, scary, but also really cool and amazing. It was fantastic, man. The rest of the cast is just out there at times, but the really cool thing about it is Lezlie Deane, Yaphet Kotto, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan is really amazing and so great in some of the scenes.Overall, Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is not a horror movie, it's like a horror / comedy movie and is not the best film in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse.6 out of 10 stars.

The first thing is that this was made with the wrong intentions, gone are almost all the horror elements that made this series great to begin with and instead they just went down the comedy route, the intention was that they wanted this to appeal to all ages and make Freddy a pop culture icon, which he already was, so why they decided to go down this route is beyond me. But what I did like about this though is that we got to delve deeper into Freddy's back-story which was rather interesting and the fact that he's wiped out all the teen population of Springwood, leaving only the adults was another creepy factor, but ultimately goes nowhere and what really lets it down is that it just gets way too stupid and over the top, with so many desperate attempts at humour and everything mostly failing, the lack of deaths isn't a problem, it's just that they were done so poorly and uninteresting, just style over substance. It just seems that more went on the set pieces than any actual tension or action, and to be honest they look rather dull and bland, and not filmed with any flair whatsoever.The cast this time aren't all that interesting, due to not enough time given to them. Lisa Zane was decent in her turn as social worker Maggie, although nothing is done with her during the first hour and when it turns out she's Freddy's daughter, things do pick up and overall she proves to be a decent match for him. Shon Greenblatt as John Doe was okay as the last remaining kid from Springwood, but sadly his story arc goes nowhere as he's dispatched way too early. Breckin Meyer does okay as the stoner as do Ricky Dean Morgan, but again their characters suffers from a poor script and quickly become disposable. Lezlie Deane had potential as the troubled tough girl and Yaphet Kotto is great as always. Of course Robert Englund is brilliant as ever and is probably going through the motions at this point, but he can only do what's written on paper, but he's still a legend as always.All in all glad that this one wasn't the final nightmare, and the series would redeem itself, but this does bring things to a full circle and does have some interesting plot points, but way too many were rushed and unresolved.

Director Rachael Talalay offers instead the crazed killer threatening kids with his knives and offering a litany of lame wisecracks. There is no visual pizazz. The last ten minutes or so was filmed in a cheap 3D format and I guess that was the big selling point here but the segment falls as flat as the rest of the film. There's a few guest stars in blink and you miss them cameos (Johnny Depp, Rosanne and Alice Cooper) and an ugly backstory where Freddy murders his wife and attempts to do the same to his child to try to hold viewer interest but none of it works.

The original film was no great shakes but at least the concept was solid, whereas the sequels have watered it down into a succession of rubbery dream sequences and cheap send-off lines from good old Freddy, the child murderer with a wisecrack for every occasion. This one is cut-price tat, lazily recycling scenes from the previous movies and horror clichÃ©s from the dawn of time. It mixes this prime material into a barely coherent plot which makes insensitive use of its abused teenage characters, setting them up for grisly deaths rather than have them fight against their problems in any meaningful way.

With the adults experiencing mass psychosis there is evidence of one surviving teenager...With a rock-track intro and sweeping Escape from New York styled title card (paraphrased above) Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare distances its self even further from its origins and previous characters. With nods to the Twilight Zone and The Wizard of Oz with Freddy Krueger featuring as the witch with in the first five minutes you know this is more of nightmare adventure than a horror.Some strong visual effects are sadly brought down by some less effective ones. Thankfully The Final Nightmare benefits from a 1080p makeover with the now redundant 3D segments looking balanced. Director and long-time Newline employee Rachel Talalay takes the helm with producer Rob Shay putting in a humorous cameo early doors. Although the tone seems inconsistent Talalay delivers and an array of tracking shots and thought-out compositions . There's more of a real dreamlike feel in some scenes but it delivers very few shocks or surprises. The twist and insight into Freddy's past- from a child, youth to adulthood makes The Final Nightmare of interest even if the scenes are only brief.The acting is a lot better with the lead teens surprising good alongside the likes of Lisa Green and Yaphet Kotto as Doc. Tom Arnold and Roseanne Barr cameo as well as Alice Cooper as Mr. Underwood. In addition, Johnny Depp (who starred in the original and by now a big star) cameos and fans may feel it's a shame Depp didn't save this for the superior New Nightmare.Brian May's (not of the band Queen) score has all the familiar cues you expect and gives the film much of the required chills in the unsurprising death set pieces. In a nice round up in the closing credits many of the actors from previous films appear in a Nightmare on Elm Street flashback scene compilation accompanied by Iggy Pop's 'Why Was I Born? (Freddy's Dead)' track.Michael DeLuca's screenplay and Talalay's story tackles some serious issues, the effects of abuse, parenting and the like but this is brushed aside for the Freddy showman factor. Here Robert Englund while excellent as Krueger plays up DeLuca's comedy aspect, unfortunately the makeup on display while slickly done is again on the latex side and rubber looking. The climax delivers a little more blood and action then expected but the final effects take that edge away.This 'final' instalment is more of the dreams of a 50's kid than nightmarish - it's a fun enough entry that gives a fitting yet abrupt end to the child killer. While respectably successful- in retrospect and like its predecessors you can't help but feel that producers pandered and delivered what the audience wanted at the time and not necessarily what they needed i.e a primordial creepy horror like the first.

This film gets a lot of criticism, mainly for being to comedic or not scary. There always will be a debate over people who don't like the comedic Freddy vs those who like his wise quacks. Personally the wise quacks don't bother me too much and as Mr.Englund once said the humor was always there and that's true. In the 1st film Freddy had a dark humor like tonguing Nancy over the phone. But Englund also said he and the director might'eve went overboard with the humor in this one, which I kinda agree with but the reason is because director/writer Rachel Talalay said she felt the last film was too dark and wanted to make her film lighter. However I overall like this film because I think it's well directed, has some really interesting ideas and does a good job at ending the series. What I like most about this movie is that it does a good job at answering a lot of questions like how do you kill Freddy for good? what would Freddy do if he killed all the kids in the town? and how did he get the power to enter people dreams? I think the film does a really job at answering those questions and every Freddy fan like myself should be satisfied with what they came up with. The film is well written and directed with good pacing, an interesting story, and good characters. First let me start with the special effects which are really great and well used in the film. The murder scenes are important in these kind of slasher films and in this film the murder scenes are imaginative and disturbing but not particularly scary in comparison to the other ones, which might be a let down for some. All the characters in this film come off as 3 dimensional and interesting not just would be victims for Freddy. Rachel does a great job at creating good dream sequences. Robert Englund is once again excellent as Freddy. But the best part is the story for this one, where I think Rachel came up with a lot great stuff, although some of it was confusing. SPOILER ALERT... this film is not a direct sequel to the last one where Freddy was taken prisoner by his mother. The film starts where in a 10 year period Freddy tragically killed all the children in the town of spring wood, driving all the adults crazy. While this is sad it works for setting the stage for a bigger battle with Freddy. However, Freddy is trapped in the town and keeps one kid alive to help him break out. We meet a child psychiatrist named Maggie played by Liza Zane who lives in the next town. Zane comes off as a little stiff at times but overall does a good job. Yaphet Kotto is really good as Maggie's friend and dream expert. We find out Maggie is really Katherine Kruger, Freddy's daughter from before he was burned alive and he needed her to help him escape from spring wood. He then revealed to her his true plans by saying every town has an elm street which is not only one of the greatest lines in movie history but reveals that he plans to go from town to town killing children, showing that he's no longer just a threat to elm street of spring wood but the whole world. We also find out the way Freddy can die for good, pull him out of your dream and into the real world where he's human. That's a very satisfying answer to how can you kill Freddy because that hearkens back to the first film and every other film Freddy was killed in a dream. The most interesting part are the back-story/flashbacks of Freddy. I wish the film could of explored more on Freddy's past. We find out Freddy was married and had a daughter. Which is kinda weird because Freddy kidnapped and killed little kids but he had a kid himself. But it dosen't exactly contradict the previous films, as we just assumed he was a weird loner kidnapping kids but it's even more interesting that he had a family but had a secret life as a kid killer. But the idea of Freddy having a daughter is great in the sense that the best person to have the honor to kill Freddy is his daughter. A kid killer killed by his own kid! We find out that Freddy killed his wife after she found out about his killings and his daughter accidentally saw it and he threatened her not to tell. They implied that Kathy told the police but never really makes it clear. Freddy also had many other horrific claws he used as murder weapons which was a interesting idea. The most interesting is seeing Freddy as a child and for the first time getting an idea of why Freddy grew up to be a killer and hate children. He was taunted by both kids & adults who chanted son of a hundred maniacs when he went to school, for the first time you feel bad for Freddy. He was raised by an unloving & mean stepfather played by rock legend Alice Cooper who was perfectly cast in the role. Also as a child he had violent tendencies from killing animals to cutting himself. So to me it seems like the reason Freddy hates children is because his childhood was so screwed up, he wants to take away everybody's childhood. And it was evil demons that gave him the power to kill in people's nightmares. Th 3-D at the end was okay. Overall a very good end for Freddy.

Over the course of the preceding sequels, Freddy had already adopted an increasingly prevalent comic persona, and it seems that after the messy and disjointed Nightmare 5, director Rachel Talalay decided that the dream-stalking boogeyman should stop competing with the crowded field of horror franchise icons and focus entirely on slashing at our funny bones instead. Bad call, Rachel.Before the film even gets underway, the opening credits spell disaster right off the bat, offering us a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche followed by an old Freddy one-liner chestnut. Perhaps even worse, we are treated with a song that sounds like an uptempo Goo Goo Dolls number and readily earns the prize for the crappiest music ever to grace the franchise, no small feat considering that by this point Nightmare films had been accompanied by Dokken's Dream Warriors and the infamous Freddy Rap. The high-concept and increasingly elaborate dream kills the franchise is famous for reach an absurd apex here. When our first victim is a deaf teen who is dispatched after Freddy affixes a demonic hearing aid to the lad's ear and scratches his claws on a chalkboard until his prey's head explodes, it's pretty much cemented that the only reason we're going to finish watching this film is out of some sort of misguided completist loyalty to the series.So much of Freddy's Dead completely ignores or misconstrues the mythos laid out in the movies before it that the only thing that ultimately ties this sixth installment to the rest of the series is Freddy himself. The deviation most insulting to fans is Freddy's revelation that the murders in the earlier films were committed because his daughter was taken from him when his pre-dream demon crimes were discovered (so I took all their children away). After 5 films supporting the excellent back-story that Freddy's impetus is systematically killing the children of the vigilante parents who burned him alive, this alteration to the origin is both needless and confusing. By the time we discover during the denouement that Freddy was granted his horrifying powers by a trio of floating latex puppets who look like prehistoric fish, it has already been made abundantly clear that the film-makers either didn't like or haven't seen the original Nightmare On Elm Street.In installments 3 and 4, so much was made of the Kristen character's ability to pull her friends into her dreams (it was her unique dream power, remember?), but in Freddy's Dead, characters are inexplicably able to insert themselves into other characters' nocturnal visions at will. Even more confusing is how often the film forgets whether or not characters are asleep. Awake characters witness the dream actions of sleeping characters without explanation, such as in the extended video game skit, where three lucid characters watch the impending victim bounce around the house in a ridiculously bad slapstick physical comedy routine complete with boing boing sound effects. The sequence ends when our social worker heroine (still awake) watches a gaping chasm open in the floor and swallow the felled teen.Of course, the star of any Nightmare outing is Freddy himself, who we usually end up rooting for by default. This becomes extremely difficult in Freddy's Dead, in which our lovable supernatural mass murderer is reduced to a wisecracking buffoon. This time out, the same boogeyman who once butchered Johnny Depp so grotesquely that a fountain of blood shot out of his bed settles for gleefully making his avatar whip one of his objects of torment in the butt with a towel until the victim falls to his death. Worse, the now-customary one-liners are simply groan-inducing here (I'll get you, my pretty, and your little soul too!), and the Freddy in this installment is one of the more annoying characters you're likely to find in any movie, ever.Aside from the ultimately pointless cameos, the only bit of inspired casting is the presence of the woefully under-used Yaphet Kotto. It's just a shame that this is the place he makes a welcome appearance.The gimmicky 3-D sequence was dumb when the film came out (I'm a bit ashamed to say that I originally saw this film in the theater and I still have my commemorative Freddy's Dead 3-D glasses), but by today's standards, it looks positively primitive. Watching the final reel in 3-D on the DVD release gave me a stinging headache, although to be fair, the 65-minute onslaught of stupidity that preceded it might be partially responsible.Titles to titles, this is a simply awful movie, and an embarrassment to a franchise that already had its fair share of clunky moments. I suppose I should find at least one good thing to say about Freddy's Dead, so I will mention this it's the shortest film in the series.It's almost impossible to imagine that the follow-up to this was Wes Craven's thoughtful and brilliant New Nightmare.

That of course means Freddy has killed every teen in the town except him. He gets knocked unconscious and loses his memory leading him to a halfway house in a different town where he meets a counsellor Maggie (Lisa Zane) and a few other teens who eventually will be murdered by Krueger. John, Maggie and the others head off to Springwood to find out who John Doe is. The town is deserted with only a few adults roaming around like a bunch of escaped mental patients. The townsfolk include Roseanne Barr and Tom Arnold. We eventually learn that Freddy had a daughter and Surprise, it's Maggie! She must take down the evil child murderer once and for all, and judging by the film's title I'm sure you know who wins the battle.The acting is horrendous in this one. Far worse than any of the previous sequels. Lisa Zane has one expression throughout the whole film, and that's of boredom. And the Freddy makeup is awful in Nightmare 6. He's got two open wounds on each cheek and that's it. He looks like he's practically human. His teeth are white! I also dislike the fact they didn't continue with the story of Alice or even mention any of the previous sequels. The characters in this sixth film are unlikable in every way possible.So why 4 stars out of 10? Robert Englund as Freddy. Sure his one liners aren't as witty as the previous films, and his make up isn't as well done - but killing someone through a video game dream sequence has to be a first in horror. And I do like the further back story of Freddy's childhood and we see he had a wife and child during his killing spree in Springwood. We get to see how truly twisted the man was and what led to his psychotic behaviour.The cameos by Johnny Depp, Roseanne, Tom Arnold, and Alice Cooper are pointless. The 3-D gimmick is ridiculous. Freddy of course isn't dead and this isn't the final nightmare. We can all be thankful for that, because this would have been a terrible way to go.

He doesn't have much motive or bloodlust. He doesn't seem to want to torment people anymore. He just does it because he's Freddy. Most of the movie is a comedy and turns into a soap opera towards the end. This is NOT the terrifying horrific Freddy Kreuger you get with the earlier films. Total joke. Then you get insane twists in the plot with more of Freddy's lineage and history.Lots of effects. Decent although grasping-at-straws plot. Everything else is lame. Everything is too hasty and makes Elm Street 6 look like it was made strictly for business purposes. Not to make a kickass movie. Too many characters, most not significant enough. There's too much drama and twists and turns. What happened to the classic, simple plot of Elm Street 1? It works. You don't need a thousand twists in the plot to make Freddy horrifying and that movie a classic. And you don't need Freddy to be hanging around and making conversation and cracking jokes in every scene because all it does is make him look like a joke.

Yeah this movie is chockfull of horrible actors.Oh, and you get to see Freddy unmasked, that is before he got burned and became the Freddy we've known from the start.

He was absolutely terrifying in A Nightmare on Elm Street and he was disturbingly funny in the other sequels but should this really be the final nightmare? Well the story is below average and tends to bore you in some scenes. The characters were badly written with the exception of Freddy with his witty one-liners before his kills. The writing is mediocre and the direction is okay but I think what saved this movie a lot was Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and the nightmare scenes. The nightmare scenes were entertaining enough and the last scene was executed very well. Robert Englund is brilliant as Freddy and really makes the character his own. Overall, it's not as bad as the second or the fifth Nightmares but it's not better than the past Krueger movies.I'm torn here because while I enjoyed some of the scenes, the story felt like it wasn't done well enough. The idea of the story, of Freddy shaking up the entire town since the teenage population was killed by him, was a great idea but it was executed quite poorly. I did like watching the past scenes when we saw Freddy's life and why he is the way he is. The special effects weren't as good as the others but still, even though some parts of the movie was a little more ridiculous than the fifth movie, it was entertaining.Read more reviews at www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"Easily the worst in the series","Date":"19 April 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Not only the worst Nightmare, but quite possibly the worst film ever made.

No other horror series produced more top notch films than the Nightmare series &#x96; namely #1, #3, #4, #7, and an honorable mention #5. As always, there are misfires that practically destroy the legend and franchise.While #2, A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge is the worst of all, #6 Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare comes in a very, VERY close second. Sure, it has its moments, as in a few funny Freddy lines and motions (SEE Freddy dancing behind one deaf victim) the rest of the movie sorely stunk.The movie was horribly written including a wildly predictable script made up of enormously incomprehensible subplots, inconsistencies, plot holes bigger than the town it's based on and legends either rewritten (incorrectly) or its own rules it breaks at every turn. Don't even get me started on the horrid guest stars namely Roseanne and (then husband) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp &#x96; who, even in 1991, should've known better to return to this now DEAD series and Alice Cooper who should've agreed to appear when the films were at their peak not in the pits.In addition, the special effects were awful especially and mainly during the joke-use of 3-D-scenes and monsters. (Here, wear these special cheap 3-D glasses during your dream and you can enter Freddy's mind! Or put them on to tell the audience when to put theirs on since we didn't have a budget to shoot the whole thing in 3-D.) Also, the mystery of Freddy's offspring was a joke as were the discrepancies in the story &#x96; Freddy wants the last teen to escape Springwood, OH (which surprisingly looks closer to, say, California) to fetch and can't follow with/without him but then can leave whenever and that same survivor has amnesia, but can remember Freddy when the plot asks for it. And don't even get me started on the cop-out ending that's already been done many times in the same series. (Not to mention &#x96; spoiler &#x96; when Freddy's pulled out, once again of the dreamland, he's supposed to be in our realm, but can easily climb ceilings, repair broken fingers and change from his burnt skin to Robert Englund's mug. If you've made it this far in the movie, then not only shame on you, but you deserve what you get in this laugh-out-loud horrible finale.) I'm not going to bother wasting too much more time on the plot line, but said final-teen survivor leaves Springwood and inadvertently sets off yet another chain reaction of Freddy killings while Nightmare Stalker Krueger gives a new reason for his previous-human mass killings they took his only child. (This is contradictory to the real legend of him just being a child murderer who got burned alive, by the parents of the victims, after caught and released on a technicality. I'm not sure why they changed the story, but for laziness.) I understand Freddy finally managed to kill off Nancy (the original heroine from #1 and #3) but my heart always goes out for Alice (the take-over heroine from #4 and #5.) Though no direct reference to either character, I'm assuming Freddy finally got to Alice, as they mention ALL children/teens have been killed, but one, this guy in this movie. (I'm so disgusted with this feature, that I won't even bother looking up his name.) I'm not sure if that's true or not, because last we seen of Alice in #5, she was pretty much grown up. This is neither here nor there, but again, as a fan, you want to see the heroes prevail, no matter how dark the source material is.I will admit, I liked some of the lines from Freddy and despite the disgustingly bad script and film making, at least Englund tried to give the fans what they liked best. The music wasn't too bad and lead actress/character played by Zane was actually good. All of these qualities produced a mere Â½ more to 1Â½/5 stars, making this the 2nd worst Freddy movie.This movie is an abomination and along with #2, should be avoided. The rest were either great, really good or watchable. #2 and #6 should be burned along with Freddy.

There weren't many deaths either. One of them was a real joke too...Robert Englund portrayed his legendary character Freddy Krueger once again as time-less, but that's just about the only good thing about the movie.They tried again to add more to the series by explaining more about Freddy's past, but it only makes it more confusing.A real shame the series ended this way... (because I think Nightmare 7 is not really a sequel, but more what happened between 1 and 3; and Freddy vs. Jason is just a spin-off). I loved Nightmare 1, I somewhat enjoyed Nightmare 2, Nightmare 3 was really good, maybe the best in the series, Nightmare 4 was nice too, better on some aspects, worse on others and I think Nightmare 5 added some nice touches and wasn't that bad.but...Nightmare 6 sadly just doesn't deliver. One hour after watching it, I had forgotten most about it already, and that's not a good sign...Go watch it if you want to see all of the Nightmares, but don't expect too much like in 1, 3 or 4...5 out of 10 stars... sorry Freddy.

A more appropriate term I suppose would be 80s induced seizure. My head hurt after watching this film, and the lame 3-D glasses didn't help. They only served to make the film even more goofy. I can understand wanting to have the 3-D effect in a horror film. OK, you're right, I can't understand but I suppose in some strange bizarro land it is sort of plausible. Sort of. That being said don't try to write the glasses into the plot. The plot was already stupid and confused, that just took away any credibility. Wait, did I say credibility? Sorry, that was dead from the start. To begin with the movie, has no continuity between the real and dream world. None. Also every death scene is ridiculous. By Freddy standards this ranks somewhere around the second film, which isn't good. The acting is really bad. The director, whose name escapes my memory (because I trained myself to forget), did a horrible job. Uwe could have done better. Also as a character, Freddy is pretty lame in this film. I can't remember him actually attacking anyone. He just kind of goofs around and flashes his claws at people while saying retarded things that will make you want to beg him to stop. I guess this movie is kinda funny if you are into the Mystery Science Theater scene, but after the first half hour I was ready to just give up. On this and humanity.

If Texas massacre 3 was as bad as it gets, then this one was a bit higher, but only a bit. Freddy's disturbing a teenager who's afraid of height and who's thrown by Freddy somehow to another town where he meets three more teenagers having the same Freddy-mania. With their doctor they get to Springwood where of course they get lost, appear on Elm street. Then three of them are killed. The doctor and a girl still alive go back. Where with the help of another doctor they decide to pull Freddy out of the dream and then only kill (we saw that in the very first part, remember?) HORROR, IN A VERY BAD MEANING. As it was released it had the mark they saved the best for the last on. Well, this is no way the best for the last. Only one thing could hardly save this movie from the complete shame and failure &#150; this nightmare was to kill Freddy forever and everybody went to see Freddy for the last time. The filmmakers of this project perhaps had forgotten what the movie and the story were really about. Freddy had knives on his hand which he didn't use even single time in this part. The ideas of showing Freddy before he was burnt, his childhood and his daughter were good, but absolutely not developed. The script is very empty. Perhaps dialogs are average but the plot is really boring, nothing really goes on even when somebody gets killed. There's even an episode of Lisa Zane's really poor acting. The part where they show how Freddy was really killed and the dream things fading in and saying Freddy, we know what you need is so pathetic. Characters are not many. Victims are only free plus one hardly linked with the movie. That's one problem. Freddy's absolutely not scary and Englund's standard acting really has something to do with my nerves. There's almost no special make-up here. New Line cinema is now my favourite studio, but the beginning of 90's didn't turn out so good for them. Now this is what happens when you get greedy. The producers were sure the good cover is enough to come up with everything in this movie, and if they hired such good directors like Renee Harlin (4), Steven Hopkins (5), Chuck Russell(3) for the previous shot parts, now they let Rachel Talalay direct this one. It could be much better because it was the last one, and as I said already, the idea for the script was really good, it shouldn't be killed such a stupid way. 1 out of 10. Very bad.

The (early) feeling of this decade is perfectly displayed on the movie.The Final Nightmare is heavily underrated and believe it or not, it's the second most original of the Nightmare movies (of course, besides the original). Rachel Talalay in a brave job as director, ignores the 80's slasher standards and tries to get Freddy Krueger in the 90's happenings.That's why you will find whacky clothing, rock tunes, cartoonish f/x, but a better cinematography, sound, and production values. The genre was on transition after the slasher subgenre was about to vanish. Freddy's Dead survived the change and contributes with more than you think.If you compare the previous Nightmare movies to this talking visually there's a huge difference. Freddy's Dead has cool f/x (I will get into that), a rocking soundtrack, an interesting plot, and decent actors.*SPOILERS* Freddy's Dead is a spectacular slasher movie talking about production. The visuals really kept my attention. The opening sequence impressed be back when I watched the movie in theaters. The plane going through the terrible thunderstorm looked amazing and cool. John Doe's scene when falling to earth looks also pretty amazing. Also, the scene of his death is very good and is probably one of the best in the series. I love the scene where Freddy taks his soul. It's a memorable scene for the genre. The settings are carefully displayed and add creepiness to the movie.For instants I thought this could be the perfect Nightmare On Elm Street movie because it has stunning f/x PROPER for a movie that deals with nightmares and sci-fi situations. Freddy Krueger looks comfortable in the 90's. Lisa Zane gives a decent performance. She's mature, beautiful, and very sexy. Yapet Kotto also gives an interesting performance and even manages to beat the hell out of Freddy in a pretty intense sequence.The supporting actors (the teens) deliver good performances and are not that easily beaten. Robert Englund gave a goofy performance but the good thing is that it seems that he had a blast in his final Freddy Krueger performance.The weakness of Freddy's Dead is the late addition of his sister. You can't come out with such an important character for the series in the last movie. There's just too much to assimilate in only 90 minutes. The movie couldn't last longer because it's a slasher movie and it's intention was to give Freddy a DECENT death. Freddy's Dead accomplished only 50% of it's intentions. Freddy's final scene was impressive but came out of nowhere. The idea to trap Freddy in the real world is interesting but wasn't carried carefully. There wasn't a good connection of events and that's why the movie has many plot holes and it's sometimes difficult to understand.Another weakness in the movie is it's lack of deaths. Come on, this is a slasher flick and if there aren't deaths and gore then something is wrong. I guess that Talalay felt that there was more of a need for sci-fi and fantasy than slasher elements from the 80's. The Nightmare On Elm Street movies are popular because of it's creative deaths. Carlos death was just OK if you ignore Freddy's one-liner, John Doe's death is one of my favorites from the series because it's pure ANOES. Spencer's death is lame. The scene is something to forget. The Freddy character in a video game was a terrible idea. Freddy's Dead delivers expectations and is a good early 90's horror movie. It brings the popular ANOES elements to the 90's and that's why the movie is unique. After the original A Nightmare... and Dream Warriors this is the best of the series. 7/10. Watch this movie as a unique Freddy Krueger movie. There are good f/x and an inventive camera work. Freddy's Dead is an entertaining slasher that catches the 90's feelings in every aspect. Watch for cameos from Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp!

(although i forgot about the crummy special effects towards the end)This for me is a rare case where i have enjoyed the last in the series more than the previous movies.I feel that Freddy him self was the best character in the whole movie. he was funny and came up with more funny original ways of killing people while they sleep. Where he kills the stoner in the computer game is ace. The fact that Freddy sung 'Garden of Eden' with a funkadellic background never fails to amuse me.Probably the only let down in this movie for me was the terrible special effects at some points. i mean at the end where Freddy explodes and for some reason they thought it would look good if they had his head flying towards the screen. What the hell were they thinking. i laughed so hard when that happened, i had to rewind it several times just to take in the magnitude of it's incredible lameness.Overall the movie managed to entertain me more than any of the other in the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' collection.

Is it a great film?  Hell, no, far from it, but at least it's entertaining which is important.One thing that was good in this flick that 4 and 5 lacked (especially 5) was realistic characters that you liked.  Sure, they were stupid at times, but at least they had more than one personality trait.  Shon Greenblatt almost seemed like Ash from Evil Dead.  He was somewhat chicken hearted but still held up under pressure and even had funny lines to deliver.

I also thought Lisa Zane wasn't a good choice, she just seemed so stiff.The story didn't pick up where 5 left off which, personally, I thought was a good thing (The Dream Master storyline was getting a little old), but it didn't really ignore the last films either.  The plot was similar to part 4, only this time Freddy wants out of Springwood to kill new kids.  One of the cool things in this flick was that it showed more of Freddy's past (his younger years) and also how he got his powers.Once again pushing the bar on effects, the entire end sequence of Freddy's Dead was shot in 3-D.  Now, since I have the DVD version, I got to see it in 3-D.  It looked ok, but I'm sure it would have been a lot better on the big screen (still I wonder if they'll release similar versions of Friday the 13th 3 and Jaws 3).  Aside from the semi-spiffy 3-D ending, the rest of the effects were pretty good also.  The whole opening sequence was pretty wild and filled with effects.  I especially liked the never-ending hill.  If you've seen the flick, you'll know what I'm talking about.Freddy's Dead is far from the best in the series, but I'd still say watch it once.  At the very least, you'll laugh through the first half.

While New Nightmare is very scary and good ect, ect it is not a true sequel since it did not take place in the actual NOES universe. On with the review...This was the first elm st I saw(age five) and while it's far from scary I still to this day maintain that it's a decent movie and hardly deserving of it's shoddy reviews some have given it. The plot is as always (except for two which even I couldn't stand)solid and features some really good performances from Lisa Zane who carries a certain B-movie charm with her and Yahpet Kotto who never really gets noticed anyways. Plus the funny cameos from Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper are not to be missed. The cameos from Rosanne and Tom Arnold (Tom's film debut no less) provide little more than the films only true scare.The dream sequences are also pretty funny. The best one being the video game scene which is a little too silly and not as long as it should have been but is still very good. Another thing that warrants a rental is the always top notch Robert Englund who's pretty much just goin through the motions here and pushes back scares for laughs and some of them work and some don't.One of the downside to this is for one the poor cast of teens...every last one of them are shallow and poorly acted. Their only real use was to much me wish Alice, Nancy or hell any previous elm st teen was around to give Freddy a real challenge. Though, with this in mind the final battle between Freddy and Zane was still fun. Another disappointment was the lack of kills in this...while the film makers try to make each kill really count for something if you're an elm st fan chances are you're gonna be wishing for more.In the end though, FD is for the love or leave it variety and is by far not the worst elm st sequel. So if you're a die hard elm st fan and haven't seen this yet, give it a shot. You could certainly do a lot worse.

It's the first A Nightmare on Elm Street movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It has as a result that Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is often a silly movie to watch but at the same time that's what making this movie so fun and watchable.This change is definitely a step up for the series. The last previous sequels were starting to go downhill pretty fast. This movie changes that around and opened the door for some new fresh opportunities for the series.It's obvious that they tried to reboot the series again with this movie. Instead of simply naming this A Nightmare on Elm Street 6 they gave it a different name to make obvious this movie would be a fresh start and pick a different approach from its predecessors. It's also a nice move that instead of simply having teenage characters in it, the movie also uses some more adult roles within the movie. It also has some well known actors such as Yaphet Kotto in it and Tom Arnold, Rosanne Barr, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in some small cameo appearances. It also features a young Breckin Meyer in his theatrical movie debut.Story-wise the movie isn't anything too special but still it's better written than some of the previous sequels in the long running successful series, that evolve around the maniacal Freddy Krueger. This movie also does a good job at revealing a bit more of Krueger's past, before he became he maniacal dream killer. The movie and its story also definitely get better as it progresses. The second halve of the movie for instance is significantly better than the first, that is still mostly being formulaic for its series.Krueger has always played some strange games with his victims in their dreams but this time it really goes over-the-top.

Boy was I wrong. Incredibly wrong.When I watched the first ten minutes of it, I was actually really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it'll improve. It didn't.Not only is this just a dire film by itself, it didn't need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back!? The acting in it was TERRIBLE, the story-line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well. The way they made Springwood was just totally wrong. Pays no respect to the first one at-all. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really over-the-top.Some people are saying that this film was funny. This film is not funny at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be funny? I would call it funnily crap. This film is supposed to be a Horror film, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, wouldn't that information have surfaced like in the first one!? The ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy, exactly like the rest of it. This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. Just shows itself up.Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so good in the beginning, yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin. They shouldn't have even bothered making this film. Nor any of the other sequels, except the third one.

And this sixth entry to the series is not only Freddy's death, but also the absolute death of a series that has long been suffering from decrepitude. The entire series is overrated, but the 1984 original and the 1987 third part, The Dream Warriors were creepy, and more than decent films that are highly recommendable. The second and fourth film were already lame, and with the fifth part, the series became total crap. While the fifth installment The Dream Child was already a travesty in which the once scary maniac Freddy Krueger was nothing but an idiotic joker, this sixth Nightmare film enters new dimensions of awfulness. Freddy Krueger, once a creepy and brutal madman, is now about as scary as Caspar the friendly Ghost. He kills his victims by insufferably idiotic methods like putting them into Nintendos and making them jump themselves to death. As if this was not bad enough, the film seems to try really hard to destroy all the creepiness Freddy Krueger once had in the earlier films. While the fourth and fifth sequel are only recommended to hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiasts, Freddy's Dead should be especially avoided by those who like the other Nightmare films. Rachel Talaly obviously found it necessary to explain why Freddy Krueger became so evil - It was his bad childhood and youth (sob) that made him a monster. This exceptionally idiotic explanation, as well as flashbacks to a time when Freddy was still regularly alive, almost ruin everything about the character of Freddy Krueger in the prior films, and the film should therefore be avoided by those who like the other Freddy Krueger films... and by those who don't. In short The film should be avoided by anybody. I won't even discuss how Freddy is finally killed - I'll just say this much It involves 3d glasses. A cameo appearance by Johnny Depp doesn't save anything here either. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is an unspeakably embarrassing, insufferable and god-awful film that has to be avoided at all costs!

Fred and Jason were chasing me around my house, which was slowly filling with maggots and puss. I called a truce and stopped running away. From this, I comfortably leaped into my now developed morbid fixation. I became a friend to the villain. Alas, Freddys Dead is by far my favorite. It's not particularly the goriest and the sex is mysteriously vanished, pretty strange considering the trends set by the previous movies. What draws me to this one is the same things that draw me to bugs bunny cartoons or Marx brothers movies. Freddy Kruger, through a smatter of sequels, had grown in to a true cultural icon by this point. He had a history and origin but was still second class. This one is his movie. Little attention is paid to the teenagers that have wasted out time through the sequels. They all die off pretty quick except one. The rest of the movie is Freddy time. Although, the killing scenes are the most creative in this one since three. I had the chance to see this in the theater. I had grown up on 50's b-class horror movies, so I was very excited to put on the 3D glasses. I had them for years afterward. This is how I like to remember Freddy Kruger.

The 90's was a decade that didn't translate well for horror, the horror movie sequels for example worked in the 80's because the 80's feel added a grittiness that translated to the creepiness and gore factor. However in the 1990's horror movies were losing ground and Freddy's Dead is a prime example of a 90's horror flick. It has all the wisecracks from Freddy, it has all the gore and yet it has no idea how to translate it into a suspenseful or even entertaining movie. The movie is flashy looking because after all it was made in the 90's but the 80's characters were always more believable as slasher bait then 90's teens. Freddy's Dead represents a sequel so unbelievably tired that even Freddy seems bored with killing. Indeed the gore here as I said, is there but for some reason it has less impact and there is less blood mainly due to the censorship. What is most ironic is that it was the period of toned down violence of the 90's which gave us a columbine but back in the 80's all us teens worried about was getting beat up. Nonetheless i'm getting ahead of myself, Freddy's Dead's only point of interest is the video game sequence which is so bad it has to be seen to be believed. Also the 3D sequence at the end (Complete with a very awkward note to PUT YOUR GLASSES ON note as if we couldn't figure it out on our own) was laughably bad and overall it showed us a sequel that was exhausted and bored with itself.1/2* out of 4-(Awful) "},{"Title":"Freddy's lost it","Date":"22 January 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Freddy's Dead The Final NightmareThe Nightmare On Elm street series is renowned for the evil child murderer Fred Krueger.

In the first you could see Tina dragged up the wall and gutted alive and Glen (Johnny Depp) pulled inside his bed and spewed out onto the ceiling. But now Freddy kills them by playing them like a video game. Taking a hearing aid off the kid's ear and dropping pins onto the ground. Stuffing a model with food, turning a girl into a cockroach and squishing her?? Ooh that would hurt. Shame&#133; I really can't say much else because it's so incredibly painful to mention and puts a bad name to the series. But do yourself a favor don't watch it!

This doesn't stop her subsequent use of the glove on daddy from being a crowd pleasing moment (it carries a bigger punch than a similar scene in Freddy Vs. Jason). **SPOILER ALERY*The next comes after Maggie has lodged a pipe bomb into his chest cavity, as she concludes her lengthy and humiliating act of patricide. She kisses him (Yuck! Truly Freddy's humanity has overcome his grotesque nature by this point if his daughter can manage to do this without being visibly repelled) and says Happy Father's Day. As she leaves, he seems to sigh wearily. Kids is his final word, and we see that the intended family reunion which has been the apparent motive for his killings throughout the entire series has come to end in the worst, and -fittingly, given Freddy's dark sense of humor-in the most ironic fashion possible (since this was intended to be his final outing).***END SPOILER***Again its a good, imaginative thriller (just not a good horror movie in the same sense as Halloween for example. The movie is just too over the top, and too complex in its portrayal of the boogeyman villain to revive our childhood fears in a potent way), but my biggest regret is that we never see the thoroughly rational and down to earth Maggie aborb the full truth about her existence (as if her father being Freddy Kruger wasn't bad enough, her grandmother was a nun who committed suicide, and her grandfather-er grandfatheRS were a hundred maniacs who raped said nun)  "},{"Title":"The Absolute Worst of the series","Date":"3 January 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  This is by far the worst of the Nightmare on Elm Street series.

But they turned out giving us the worst of the series (and that's saying a lot). The plot made no sense (I seriously can't remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them dead) and Freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual. The only remotely good bit about this was a brief (and funny) cameo by Johnny Depp (the first Nightmare movie was his first).Also I originally saw it in a theatre where the last section (reaccounting Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well--the 3-D was lousy--faded colors and the image going in and out of focus. Also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. EVERYBODY broke down laughing. Looks even worse on TV in 2-D. Pointless and stupid--very dull also. Skip this one and see Freddy vs. Jason again.

One of her charges is an amnesiac who has been suffering from nightmares, but it transpires that he is merely being used by Freddy in order to make contact with his long lost offspring.In Freddy's Dead, no attempt is made to scare the audience; from the outset, the whole film is played like some kind of absurd cartoon (at times, Freddy reminded me of Jim Carrey's mischievous character in The Mask) Freddy appears as the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz; Freddy scrapes his 'fingers' across a blackboard causing a victim's head to explode; Freddy kills someone by turning him into a computer game. The direction is lousy, the script childish and the acting downright bad.Talaly tries desperately to distract the audience from the extremely amateurish nature of her film by packing it with cameo performances (Rosanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp all make an appearance), and tacking on a gratuitous and very daft 3D ending. But, as the saying goes, 'you can't polish a turd' and the result is an embarrassment for all involved.

Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke. This isn't just the worst entry in the Elm Street saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre! The story is dumb, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all murky and &#150; most of all &#150; the special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it appears that Freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter. You'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures, but no&#133; There's only one teenage-survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults! How about that Freddy Krueger, who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers, eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3D-glasses! Sort of like ruins the whole essence, doesn't it? As far as I'm concerned, Nightmare on Elm Street has always been a dreadfully overrated series but, up until now, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. Freddy's Dead, however, is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his/her precious time watching it.

I think the director tries too hard at making this an all out comedy that the essence of what made Freddy Krueger so thrilling is silent. There's never a scene where one feels any kind of chilling effect from Freddy. He never appears ominous and that really hurts because even in the series' worst effortThe Dream Child), he has some creepy moments. But, in this film, he comes off as an evil clown and the film floats around Wes Craven's rules of how Freddy operates in the nightmare world and how the victims are effected on the outside despite being asleep. The idea of implementing Nintendo gaming from Freddy and his flying on a broomstick like the Wicked Witch of The West really seems yearning for some desperate laughs. The violence is still gory, but less effective. None of the kills in this film even come close to the intense death scenes in A Nightmare on Elm Street or even The Dream Master. It's actually almost a laboring attempt from me just to have to watch it for it's like watching a once great series die a long, hard death. Even the weak 3-D gimmick ruins Freddy's supposed exit from horrordom. So the film simply fails on most accounts except for the director showing us Freddy's past. That one aspect, and unfolding the mystery of who Freddy's after, is worthy of noting. It's a sad thing because I have fond memories of watching this film. Perhaps it made for that certain age where you just can more easily accept mediocrity..and a wise cracking villain doing whatever he wants in a nightmare state.

The local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane) interviews him, she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to Elm Street in Springwood where they discover that no children live there & therefore no victims for Freddy kill anyone. It all turns out that it's an elaborate plan by Freddy to find his daughter & use her to escape Springwood. When Maggie realises what Freddy is up to her & some kids decide they have to kill Freddy once & for all...Directed by Rachel Talalay this was made with the intention of being the final A Nightmare on Elm Street film which by this time had reached five, of course as any horror film fan know's if there's still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there's no way in hell Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare was going to be the last one which, of course, it wasn't. The A Nightmare on Elm Street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here & Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them. The film moves at a reasonable pace & it's rarely boring but it's so silly, childish & feels like some sort of live-action cartoon with some awful set-piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from Wes Craven's suspenseful & effective early 80's original. The sequence where stoner Spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by Freddy is terrible on it's own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall & floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing I've seen in a while, or maybe the early scenes when the John Doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the Coyote cartoon character in the Road Runner cartoons or the absurd sight of Freddy threatening the deaf Carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard. You can't take this seriously & I was just sitting there not quite believing what I was seeing. When they do finally try to kill Freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon, yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3-D glasses! The character's are poor, the dialogue is poor & the plot is confusing, it doesn't really stick to the Elm Street continuity & overall the film is a bit of a mess, the best thing I can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour & you can certainly laugh at it.The film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark, scary & sinister yet it's so silly & simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat. There's not much gore in this one, there's some cut off fingers, some stabbings, someone falls on a bed of nails & that's about it. The body count is extremely low here with only three death's. The final twenty or so minutes of Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare was in fact shot in 3-D although the version I saw presented this part as normal so I can't comment on how well this does or doesn't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3-D which take advantage of the process. The special effects vary, some are quite good actually while other's are terrible & Freddy's burnt make-up this time looks quite poor.This apparently had a budget of about $5,000,000 (it had an opening weekend box-office take of $12,000,000) & the film has a few nice visual touches & gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is. The acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including Tom Arnold & Roseanne, Johnny Depp & rocker Alice Cooper.Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series & apart from some unintentional laugh value there's not much here to recommend or enjoy. Fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from Wes Craven's original classic shocker as it gets. Followed by New Nightmare (1994) which tried to take Freddy Krueger & the series in a new & different direction.

This time out a sleep doctor (Lisa Zane) and some troubled teenagers find themselves in Freddy's hometown where the maniac is needing new victims. I remember going to see this thing on opening night and walking out hoping that another would follow. I'm not a major fan of this series but there's no question this here was a very weak way to go out so thankfully we did get a couple more movies. With that said, this film is rather confusing because there are a few points where one would think that they were trying to return Freddy to his early days of being scary but these sequences are over shadowed by some very campy and rather dumb scenes. I think the murder sequences here are amongst the worst in the series and especially the video game death, which was just downright stupid but I'm sure New Line got some cash for pretty much pimping certain Nintendo items (like the power glove). The story of the last teen from Springwood could have been used to tell many interesting stories but the one picked here simply doesn't work for a number of reasons. The biggest is that the characters involved don't catch onto the secret until the final segments of the film when the viewer will see this twist coming from a mile away. The overall tone is another major problem because at times the film tries to be serious but at other times we get campy stuff including some wild cameos by Johnny Depp, Alice Cooper, Roseanne and Tom Arnold. Another gimmick to get people into the theater was the 3-D but to me this is the worst I've ever seen from the format. It's a disappointment that only a brief sequence in in 3-D but that turned out to be a good thing if the effects were going to be this bad throughout. The 3-D sequence offers nothing fun or original and even worse is the fact that they effects are very cheap and barely work at all. They didn't work in the theater when released and the home video version doesn't make it any better. The one good thing is actually the performances with Zane doing a very good job and it's always fun seeing Yaphet Kotto. Then, of course, there's Robert Englund who does his normal great job. "}]
