[{"Title":"EVERYTHING comes wonderfully to life in this dead-on Mel Brooks horror spoof &#150; non-stop laughs from beginning to end!","Date":"15 May 2001","Score":"91 out of 113 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Mel Brooks' parodies are like your favorite, worn-out couch.  You know it's not the greatest in style, taste and quality, but it just feels so damn comfortable.  Of late, most of Mel's spoofs have been off the mark, his work mellowing into predictability.  In fact, you really have to go all the way back to 1974 to see Brooks at his sharpest.  In that year we were awarded Blazing Saddles AND Young Frankenstein.Perhaps Young Frankenstein is not definitive Mel Brooks, although he directed it.  Gene Wilder, who not only stars but co-wrote it with Mel, was the inspiration to make this movie.  And it's his influence, I think, that brings the best out in Mel.  When spoofing a historical era, movie genre or legendary tale, Brooks' satirical bag of tricks always included a hodgepodge of crude sight gags, burlesque schtick and stale Jewish jokes done at rapid-fire pace.  The plot became an after-thought, working around the barrage of unsubtle humor.  In targeting the classic &#145;Frankenstein' series, however, Brooks worked in reverse, wisely focusing on plot, tone and atmosphere, then complementing them with clever, carefully constructed bits.A rich staple of comedy pros from Brooks' fun factory (Mel graciously did not cast himself here) were employed to wring out the most laughs possible out of the fresh, inventive material.  Gene Wilder plays the frizzy-haired, eruptive college professor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-STEEN), grandson of the infamous scientist, who gives in to the maniacal tendencies of his mad ancestor after inheriting the late Baron's Teutonic castle.  His simmer-to-boil antics have seldom been put to better use, while only pop-eyed Marty Feldman, who gets to break the fourth wall as Igor (prounouced EYE-gor), the dim, oddball assistant, could milk a hump for all its worth.  Kenneth Mars too gets a lot of mileage out of his one-armed, slush-mouthed inspector.  In the film's most difficult role, Peter Boyle's appearance as the Monster is jarring at first, looking like a cross between Herman Munster and Uncle Fester.  But he increasingly wins you over, earning even a little empathy along the way.  His character is the most crucial for this parody to work right and he succeeds, figuring in a high percentage of the comedy highlights.Representing the distaff side, Madeline Kahn is one cool cucumber, stealing focus whenever she's on camera as the placid, meticulous, hopelessly stuck-up fiancee Elizabeth; Cloris Leachman sinks her teeth into the role of the grotesque Frau Bl√ºcher, whose mere mention of her name sends horses into panic; and Teri Garr is delightful as a dinghy Deutschlander who assists Frankenstein in his wild experiments and other things.An amalgamation of Universal's earliest and best &#145;Frankenstein' movies (Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and Son of Frankenstein, this spoof relies on close imitation and Brooks took painstaking methods to recreate the look and feel of James Whale's original sets, black-and-white photography and musical score.  It pays off in spades.Nearly 30 years later, this movie still leaves me in stitches.  Wilder and Garr's revolving secret door bit is still priceless, as is Cloris Leachman's &#145;ovaltine' routine and the Wilder/Boyle Puttin' On the Ritz tie-and-tail duet.  Boyle and the unbilled Gene Hackman in the Blind Hermit scene ripped off from Bride of Frankenstein are uproarious, easily winning the award for sustained hilarity in a single sketch.  Add Feldman's hump and Mars' troublesome mechanical arm and what you have is rib-tickling entertainment from start to finish.  Madeline Kahn's post-coital, cigarette-smoking scene with &#145;ol zipperneck' who leaves her in a sexual snit must go down in Hollywood annals as the funniest scene ever caught on camera.  Certainly Jeanette MacDonald's puristic rendition of Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life will never have quite the same meaning again after you've heard Madeline's spin on it. Blazing Saddles indeed has its insane moments but when it comes to toasting Mel Brooks in the years to come, Young Frankenstein should certainly stand front and center when representing this clown prince of comedy.

I first saw it in a movie theater I had no idea what it was, had very little knowledge of Mel Brooks at the time, and expected to be bored. Instead, I found myself shrieking aloud with laughter that became so intense, I missed many of the major lines. Hence the video.What can I say? From the wild-eyed Igor, the hunchbacked Transylvanian servant whose hump keeps changing from side to side, to the modern-day descendant of Baron von Frankenstein, determined not to follow in his great-grandfather's nefarious footsteps, to the nurse, a naif with enormous...er...chestal appendages, to the fearsome Frau Bleucher, whose mere mention causes horses in the castle's faraway stables to neigh in fear...to the scene of the monster and his creator singing and dancing in black tie to putting on the Ritz, this movie should come with a warning Danger--Uncontrollable Laughter May Become Chronic.The cast is beyond superb. The late, wonderful British comedian Marty Feldman (Igor), who turned his congenital wandering eyes into comedic foils, never misses a beat as second banana to Gene Wilder, who plays the distraught Dr. Frankenstein to the hilt and beyond. Cloris Leachman, who looks like a cross between a witch and a warlock, plays the feared housekeeper Frau Bleucher (neighhh!!!), and a very young, beautiful, and buxom Teri Garr plays the nurse-assistant to the good doctor. Then there is the marvelous Madeline Kahn, who gave a bravura performance as the doctor's fiancee. The late comedienne's burst into operatic ecstasy during her rape by the monster is simply inspired, and is one of the comedic high points of the entire film. All of Kahn's considerable talents came into play during this movie; she was taken from us too soon.

Add in the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hackman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc., and you have a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes.Looking at the Frankenstien monster in a tuxedo or sitting up in bed with a cigar reading The Wall Street Journal are just a few of the outlandish scenes, along Wilder entering the mansion commenting on the nice knockers.Kudos, also, for Mel Brooks having the good sense to film this in black-and- white. It may have been his best film, although Blazing Saddles would give it a run for its money. My only complaint was Wilder's constant yelling, which becomes abrasive and can give you a headache after awhile! Still, this has to be considered one of the best comedy classics ever.

Well, dammit, he makes UNPRETENTIOUS people laugh, so perhaps the man knows funny when he sees it. Of course, as Blazing Saddles ruined most 1950's and 60's westerns for me for awhile, Young Frankenstein makes it very hard to take Karloff and all that bunch from the 1930's seriously any longer. Oddly, Mel can even make us laugh at resurrected, REALLY OLD gags; such as Walk this way! (The 3 Stooges). I'll never stop laughing at Young Frankenstein.

As far as I know, Transylvania is not and never was a part of Germany, so why the thick German accent. No, honestly, for a whizkid like me there weren't any sophisticated jokes and hardly a scene managed to crack me up. Mel Brooks success is and will remain a mystery to me and I don't know how more movies of him I have to see in order to find out what's so great about him. I worked in a cabaret once and I found out that a lot of people just laughed because the guy on stage was a comedian, not because he was funny.

Although at first hesitant of embracing his controversial work, he soon changes his mind when he realizes what this would do for his career and science. But, some problems arise when trying to revive the creature...Young Frankenstein is hugely popular, scoring 8 out of 10 on IMDb and considered by many to be Mel Brooks' best and one of the funniest comedies of all time. Is it good? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. But I neither think it's the funniest of Mel Brooks' work (History of the World, The Producers and maybe even Silent Movie are funnier) or one of the greatest comedies. Maybe it's not aging well or I just don't get it, but I just don't get it.The bulk of the jokes are vaudeville and slapstick takes on the classic Universal Studios version of Frankenstein, even going so far as to use many of the same props. And while some of the scenes stand out as funny (the Puttin' on the Ritz scene, for one) the bulk of the plot is very nearly the same as the classic film. I respect the homage, even the use of the black and white film, but it does not deviate enough to be unique in my mind.In contrast, consider Brooks' Spaceballs. Yes, it is a parody of Star Wars. But it does not follow the plot too closely, deviates in almost every way, incorporates other plots and science fiction references... and has a whole variety of humor styles mixed in. While maybe not the best of Brooks' work, this film is a much more solid comedy and stands up better for a variety of audiences. (IMDB rates it lower, but I cannot agree on that.) Marty Feldman (Igor) is often overshadowed by his co-stars and Brooks, but he makes a strong Igor, and his eye condition could not have been better utilized. This character is the one clear improvement from the original film, and should not be overlooked.Gene Wilder (and Gene Hackman) were both great, of course. Many consider this to be Wilder's best role. I simply cannot accept that Frankenstein, as great a character as he is, somehow trumps Willy Wonka. As made clear when Johnny Depp -- a brilliant actor -- tried to be Wonka, there is no replacing Wilder, even by the best stars of our day.Don't get me wrong. The film is great, the directing and cinematography are excellent. The cast is amazing, particularly some of the supporting cast (like Teri Garr as Inga). But to say this is Mel Brooks' best film, one of the best comedies of all time or Gene Wilder's best role is just not correct, in my opinion. A second viewing might change my mind, but for now I would like to be convinced that this film is more than above average.

Later on , he successfully reanimates a body (Peter Boyle) which soon flees and creates wreak havoc . Hilarious Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder comedy filled with horror satire , amusing events , nice settings and lots of laughters . This spoof of the old Universal terror movies is fun from start to finish . The original cut of the movie was almost twice as long as the final cut, and it was considered by all involved to be an abysmal failure , it was only after a marathon cutting session that they produced the final cut of the film, which both Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks considered to be far superior to the original product ; at one point they noted that for every joke that worked, there were three that fell flat , so they went in and trimmed all the jokes that didn't work. Enjoyable support cast such as Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth , Cloris Leachman as Frau Bl√ºcher , Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp and brief acting by John Carradine , Leon Askin played a lawyer but was cut out , final film of Oscar Beregi Jr and of Richard Haydn , but most of his role was deleted from the final print .

A great film to be sure, but not a very successful one in the comedy department, which is a shame since it's a huge problem in an otherwise fine film.It may count as cheating since I've been a fan of *this* film since adolescence, but even after all these years, I knew I would encounter no such problem in this Mel Brooks classic.'Young Frankenstein' has the distinction of being one of those few comedies which can be just as funny for those who have never seen the source material that's being spoofed(No problem for me as I was a fan of the Universal horrors since I was even younger and had read the book even earlier), and that still offers plenty of insight for those who have. And as unpromising as it sounds to make a comedic send up of Universal's horrors, which had displayed their ability to laugh at themselves as early as 1932; it ironically emerges as the very model of how to do a successful parody, and even more amazingly, it also offers some surprising insight into the themes of the Frankenstein legend itself, or at least; much more than Kenneth Branagh's overrated 'faithful' adaption ever did.The plot is basically a comedic remake of Rowland V. Lee's 'Son of Frankenstein'(1939). The set-up is virtually the same A descendant of the original Doctor(Gene Wilder)returns to his family castle where he is ostracized by suspicious villagers led by a one-armed inspector(Kenneth Mars) and is coerced into taking up his ancestor's mantle by an unhinged former associate. The difference is that the protagonist is the grandson of the original monster-maker, the Ygor character(Marty Feldman, whose character actually is more closely patterned after Dwight Frye as Fritz & Karl than he is Bela Lugosi as Ygor) is benevolent and rather it is a sinister housekeeper(Cloris Leachman) who influences the protagonist, it also involves the creation of a new monster(Peter Boyle, giving a comedic take on the monster that is worlds beyond Clancy Brown's in 'The Bride') rather than the reviving of the original one. This doesn't stop Brooks from managing to work in references to the original from 1931 and the 1935 sequel. In less skilled hands this could have been disastrous, but thankfully Brooks was hip to the fact that 1935's 'Bride of Frankenstein' was already a horror-comedy, and he wisely didn't attempt to poke fun at things already meant to be funny. Instead he does his best to IMPROVE them. It's this approach that shows that Brooks is smarter than your average satirical filmmaker, and it's what separates him(well, besides actually being talented) from the myriad of other 'satirists' who would have either attempted to point out 'flaws' the original filmmakers were clearly aware of(Mst3k), lifted scenes verbatim(Wayans Bros.)or made up random unfunny jokes that had nothing to do with what was being spoofed(Friedberg & Seltzer).What's also remarkable is that, if one overlooks some small continuity issues(which the original Universals were JAM-PACKED with)such as names and locations(It's because this film takes place in 'Transylvania' that I am reviewing it for this marathon), as well as the comedic tone; this could actually be seen as a follow-up to the first 3 Universal Frankenstein films. Just imagine Gene Wilder's character as an adult version of Donny Dunagan from 'Son of Frankenstein' with a changed name(He mentions being embarrassed by his lineage and this leads to a running gag where he insists his name is pronounced 'Fronkensteen', making him not a self-hating Jew, but a self-hating mad scientist...who's also a Jew)to escape publicity and it works. They even have the same curly hair and Americanized personality. This suggest Brooks was aiming not at a mean-spirited comedic attack on decades old films, but at a loving homage/sequel to them instead. I can respect that.I could ramble on all day at how well it does justice to the original films and even the novel(For example; lots of people mention how when the Monster says 'You are my creator but I am your master' to Victor in the book how the Monster is in some ways a twisted reflection of Victor in that he exceeds him in all levels, proving more cunning, more sympathetic, more powerful and even has longer 'lustrous black hair' and how he actually succeeds in 'nailing' Elizabeth' by killing her long before Victor ever has sex with her; suggesting that the Monster, through a symbolic rape, is even better in bed than his creator! In 'Young Frankenstein' this subtext becomes overt Here, the Monster DOES 'rape' Elizabeth, and she falls in love with him because of his 'Enormous schwanstucker' and deserts the doctor, leaving him to marry a busty servant girl(Terri Garr) he was sleeping with anyway)but, I think I'll rap up by saying that this film is as perfect as a parody can get, good atmospheric music, great production values and Oscar-worthy performances by all.Still, as much as I like experiencing 'local color' in foreign countries, and as much as I enjoyed Kenneth Mars's character, I hope that the Romanian police don't have accents THAT thick when I visit.~ "},{"Title":"Funny but it's reputation flatters it as a film","Date":"30 June 2002","Score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" When Baron Von Frankenstein passes on he leaves his home and his work to his grandson Victor Von Frankenstein.

The greatest thing about this Mel Brook's comedy classic is that you can really tell it was made with so much affection for both Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. I think most of the humor in the movie is hit or miss, but in my case it was mostly hit. There were some parts in the movie that tried to be funny but I didn't quite get it, mostly because it feels at times very immature and juvenile, but most at the time, the movie is actually very mature and it understands the type of movie that it is. Most of the time this is actually a very smart film, not everyone could achieve this affectionate parody, but Mel Brooks did it and that is praise-worthy. The movie features an amazing performance from Gene Wilder as Frankenstein, he was cast perfectly for the role. The cinematography really resembles that of the original Frankenstein films, which I loved.Young Frankenstein is a great comedy, a movie that understands what it is doing most of the time and, although childish at times, I think fans of the original Frankenstein films and horror classics in general will enjoy this one.

Young Frankenstein brings the saga of the monster saga into the first half of the 20th Century. After several generations of experimentation with the origin of life, do you think that in Young Frankenstein the current scientist has finally got it right?Well to find out you'll have to see Young Frankenstein and Gene Wilder's take on the mad scientist, the current 20th century version of that most misunderstood family of geniuses. Fascinating though that some of the same mistakes were made in bringing the monster played by Peter Boyle to life. Didn't they watch any of the old films?However when physical science fails, psychology takes over as Wilder just thinks it might be a problem of soothing his fevered brain. The monster is also given a sex life in Young Frankenstein as Cloris Leachman finds certain attributes most attractive. In the end though an operation on that electrically charged table seems to solve both Boyle's and Wilder's problems.Funniest scene in the film is when Wilder decides to take his show on the road after teaching him a few human type tricks. Puttin' On The Ritz was never done better on screen than that song and dance duo of Wilder and Boyle. It all comes to no good though when Mel Brooks borrows from King Kong to turn the event into a disaster.Kenneth Mars does a marvelous imitation of the maimed Lionel Atwill from Son Of Frankenstein, borrowing a little from his Nazi playwright from The Producers. Listen closely and some of the best lines are thrown away by Marty Feldman as the hunchbacked assistant Ygor, pronounced EyeGor in this film. Teri Garr has some good moments as Wilder's Valley Girl type assistant Inga and Gene Hackman in his one scene as The Blind Man is hilarious.Fans of the zany humor of Mel Brooks should not let Young Frankenstein get by.

It's silly, absurd, has some clever sight gags and cringeworthy puns, and while it may not contain the self-referential, breaking-the-fourth-wall humour which made Spaceballs a classic, it's still fun. Based, obviously, on Mary Shelley's original creation, and filmed in black-and-white, Young Frankenstein's plot is simple enough for a comedy of this nature. Gene Wilder plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkonstein), a medical lecturer, who one day, receives the will of his grandfather, Victor von Frankenstein, creator of the eponymous monster, learning he's inherited Victor's old Transylvanian castle. Upon arriving in Transylvania, leaving behind his girlfriend Elizabeth (Madeline Khan), he meets Igor (pronounced I-gor; played by Marty Feldman), and his assistant Inga (Teri Garr, playing the stereotypical blonde love interest). After discovering his grandfather's downstairs laboratory, he begins pouring over Victor's old medical notes pertaining to the Frankenstein project, and after initially trying to live down his heritage, become immersed in attempting to create another Frankenstein, despite some resistance from current tenant Frau Blaucher (Cloris Leachman). Frau's appearance ignites the film's most sustained running gag; whenever her name is uttered; horses start neighing in terror. Upon successfully digging up a large enough body, Frederick's plans go awry, when I-gor, instead of picking out the right brain, takes an abnormal brain (or in his words, the brain from Abby Normal). After eventually waking up, the mono-syllabic Frankenstein monster escapes and, while he appears threatening, he simply wants to be loved. One scene involves him walking into the house of a lonely blind man (Gene Hackman), where he invites the monster in for tea. Unfortunately, the meal goes awry, when, in attempting to light a cigar, the blind man sets Frankenstein's thumb on fire.Realising the monster's needs, and under pressure from Inspector Kemp (a German officer with one mechanical arm, which he constantly has to set into position) Frederick sets out to court public sympathy for him, which culminates in a hilarious performance of Puttin' on the Ritz between the two of them, before Frankenstein's fear of fire causes the performance to end abruptly. With Frederick and Inga's love blossoming, Elizabeth arrives in Transylvania, where she is taken by Frankenstein, and, impressed by one particular part of his body, becomes The Bride of Frankenstein. In the end, in order to save the monster from a lifetime of fear and misunderstanding, Frederick's realises he must make a personal sacrifice.While the movie takes a little while to get going, once the groundwork has been laid, it gets funnier, especially with the arrival of Marty Feldman. It parodies the films of the genre well, the most notable touch being the crackles of lightning at just the right moment. Well worth a look, especially for Brooks fans.

There is a rotting skeleton holding a book. A pair of hands reaches in and tries to remove the book, but the skeletal digits seems to snatch it back. The human hands pull away, then tentatively reach again for the book, but this time they're trembling.None of Brooks' humor is elegant, revolving as it does around these primitive motives and human weaknesses such as farts. This isn't Woody Allan. Nobody is going to pull Marshall McLuhan out of a crowd and ask him to explain his theories. Nobody in Brooks' movie has ever HEARD of Marshall McLuhan.And yet when Brooks connects, he pops it out of the park. How can anyone watch the scene in which Peter Boyle's monster visits the blind Gene Hackman without laughing? The lonely Hackman, trying to please his guest, spills boiling hot soup into his lap -- twice. He smashes the monster's Bierstein and sets his thumb on fire.

Abrahams & Zucker directed Airplane!, Naked Gun series, Top Secret, Hot Shots... and Mr. Brooks made Spaceballs, Robin Hood, Dracula and, of course, this Young Frankenstein.All those movies use to be second-rate because they depend so much on gags, and it is almost impossible to fill a whole movie with good gags every 2 or 3 minutes. But for me Airplane! is an exception, and Young Frankenstein it is too (for me YF is the best spoof-movie ever). Every single scene's got a good gag, and there're a lot of hilarious sequences. It's got a nice rhythm, and all the actors play their roles as good as they're supposed to Gene Wilder (Mr. Fronkonstin!) gives us his best performance ever; Marty Feldman (aIgor) looks like a real freak (with that face you don't even need to be a real actor); and Peter Boyle (the Monster) proves that he's as good in comedy as he's in drama (you may remember him from Scorsese's Taxi Driver or Hardcore -Paul Schrader 70's-). There's no doubt that this is Mel Brooks' more remarkable and memorable movie (though I prefer Life Stinks, one of his few pictures that are not based on a previous one).

Exploring the castle Frederick discovers his grandfather's old laboratory and secret library, which handily contains a book entitled 'How I Did It', and pretty soon the old Frankenstein family trait rears its ugly head, this time in the shape of Peter Boyle as the monster.Needless to say, being a Brooks/Wilder movie this isn't a straightforward Frankenstein monster romp, though it pays loving homage to the Universal Karloff movies of the 30s. Shot impeccably in black and white and borrowing its plot from 1939's SON OF FRANKENSTEIN, it becomes a case of 'spot the film reference'. Much of the laboratory's electrical equipment is that designed by Kenneth Strickfaden for the original 1931 FRANKENSTEIN; the monster stumbles across the shelter of a blind hermit (at the time a surprising appearance by ordinarily tough-guy Hackman) in an hilarious parody of the same scenario in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN; Kenneth Mars (THE PRODUCERS) recreates Lionel Atwill's role of the local Police Chief from SON OF complete with artificial arm into which he sticks his darts during a game with the young Frankenstein (as did Atwill), and who is concerned that this new Frankenstein may be 'vallawink in his grandvadder's vootshtaps &#150; you know; Vootshtaps!

When she runs out of petals she innocently asks the monster 'What shall we throw in next?' at which point Boyle's monster turns Oliver Hardy-like to the camera and smiles knowingly. Add to all this of course the Brooks/Wilder trademark gags Igor's hump, which he denies having, keeps swapping shoulders; when his train arrives in Transylvania Frederick ask a passing shoeshine boy 'Pardon me boy, is this the Transylvania station?' 'Ya, ya, track twenty-nine' replies the boy, 'Can I give you a shine?'; to demonstrate his brilliance to the scientific community Frederick has his monster join him in a rendition of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' complete with cane, top hat and tails; a brain stored in a jar with the label 'Warning - Do Not Use This Brain' (which of course they do); horses whinny whenever Frau Bl√ºcher's name is mentioned, and Wilder's Frederick Frankenstein, with his pencil thin moustache and mop of frizzy hair, appears just as if SON OF's Basil Rathbone had stuck his fingers in a light socket.It's obvious from every scene that Mel Brooks has great affection for those old monster movies which results in this being the best thing he's ever done and, if I had one, it would certainly be amongst my all time top ten &#150; just above BLAZING SADDLES.

It is a monochrome homage to Frankenstein's monster franchise and magnificently crafted as a whole new parody with a sterling cast. Unfortunately I haven't watched any of Universal's classical horror series, so it is nonviable for me to discern how the homage aspect proceeds, nevertheless, it doesn't hamper my appreciation of this film. Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (the self-claimed pronunciation is Fronkensien), a medical professor in America, whose grandfather is the notorious mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, is lured back to inherit his family estate in Transylvania, but as a scientist himself, Frederick is strongly repellent towards his grandfather's doings. After meeting his bulging-eyed hunchback servant Igor (pronounced eyegore here), who is played by a pronounced Feldman, the desirable personal assistant Inga (Garr with a ludicrous German accent) and the frosty housekeeper Frau Bl√ºcher (the haughty and drolly Leachman), he finds out the private journals left by Victor about the reanimation of dead tissues, cannot resist the temptation, he carries out a plan to reanimate his creature (Boyle), only later he is aware that the brain he uses in the transplantation is an abnormal one. Then, the storyline flickeringly stretches over the creature's encounters with a little girl and a blind hermit (a genuinely side-splitting episode with an uncredited Hackman) after his escape, then Wilder and Brooks' script takes a drastic turn to introduce Frederick and the creature's live-performance of Irving Berlin's musical number Puttin' On The Ritz, which ends badly and the creature is captured, but it is pure fun. Frederick's fianc√©e Elizabeth (Kahn) arrives uninvited, and her consistent refusal any physical intimacy with Frederick in the name of keeping her chastity before wedding night, is comically disintegrated by sheer phallic-ism in front of the creature. And she bells out a riotous Sweet mystery of Life during the intercourse, with some splendid vocal inflections. Brooks opts for a merry finale for both Frederick and his creature, they both exchange some part of their advantages to each other and eventually, they can go out for a pleasant double date.Gene Wilder is priceless, superbly casts his deadpan humor with visceral gags, sometimes he is even affective. The sparkling chemistry between him and the scene-stealing Feldman using wisecracks and slap-sticks can effectively crack viewers up (from the walk this way spoof and on). Boyle's monster, although the make-up team is substandard, you can literally see the paddings and fake stitches in his head, is never ferocious or deliberately harmful, he is a slow-witted newborn has the primal fear of fire and fond of the euphony of violin, the caricature never transcends into scare-fest. Kahn and Leachman are two staunch comediennes, each clings to the stereotyped characterizations and builds on their own zest and zingers, so is Garr, but in a less vivid role as the bimbo and Kenneth Mars' Inspector Kemp, who is extensively lampooned for one stiff limb and inarticulate elocution. The cinematography and production design are sublime thanks to its retro polishing, the film holds extremely well for a first viewing 40 years later, it is a favorable comedy can be thoroughly enjoyed without any abashment in hindsight which prevalently resides in most of our present-day low-taste offerings, just go and watch the scariest comedy of all time!

The plot bowdlerises every monster flick you've ever seen and a lot of the gags you can see coming with bells on, (does the walk this way routine appear in every Brooks' film?), but with the wonderful Gene Wilder at its centre, hair and eyebrows everywhere, ably assisted by made-for-this-kind-of-thing actors like Feldman, Khan et al, you can forgive even the worst puns. I did think, however, that both female leads, Khan and Teri Garr, could have been used a little more.Best gags for me were Wilder's lecture to his students (loved the aside, Give him an extra buck to the old stooge dragged out for experimental purposes) and the monster's consummation with the previously frigid Khan (Oh sweet mystery of life) but the humour is spread around everyone to humorous effect.It made me feel a bit like a kid watching a pantomime and while the cinematography would have you think otherwise there are no pretensions of high art here. It's your belly laughs he's after and he gets them here, in spades.

It is an affectionate parody of the Universal 'Frankenstein' movies of the 1930's, which were based on Mary Shelley's classic novel. In this case, Gene Wilder portrays a descendant of the infamous Frankenstein who ends up resuming his grandfather's work with hilarious results.One of the most appealing things about this film is the look, which closely imitates the original films. The film is shot in black and white and many of the editing transitions and directorial choices recall an earlier style. Also enforcing the 1930's atmosphere is the score by John Morris.Bringing the story to life is an enviable cast of comedic talents. Gene Wilder does a fine job in the lead role and is given strong support from the likes of Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn.The script's sense of humour is mostly understated though there are moments of unbridled hilarity. There are a few jokes that don't quite connect with me but they are far outnumbered by the ones that do. If you haven't seen any of the old Universal movies, don't worry since the humour doesn't hinge on an extensive knowledge of the source material.In my opinion, this film ranks alongside Blazing Saddles & The Producers as some of Brooks's best work, not to mention some of the best comedies in American film. I recommend it regardless of whether or not you've seen any of the original Frankenstein films.

Not only does Brooks lovingly recreate nearly every set and every scene so accurately that film buffs can relate, but he and his able ensemble of nutcases give the whole affair that Brooksian spin that's part-Borscht Belt, part-Marx Brothers and all sublimely silly...even now, over THIRTY YEARS later!!! Besides SADDLES, it's the only other Brooks film that delivers consistent laughs every time...and in the same places!The Zucker-Abrams-Zucker team would take cues from his work about ten years later, and watching AIRPLANE! now, I can see where they got most of their inspiration.Gene Wilder is in the best form of his career as Dr. Victor FRON-ken-steen, the later-day descendant of the original monster-baiter himself. Serving up fantastic comic support are Marty Feldman as EYE-gor, his 'hump-y' lab assistant; the dearly-missed Madeline Kahn as his flighty floozy of a fianc√©e, Elizabeth and Teri Garr as the amply-endowed Inga, (What knockers! Why, thank you, doctor!) Rounding out the cast are Kenneth Mars as an Inspector only Clouseau would love, Gene Hackman in an uncredited appearance, who shows why he was the most logical choice to play Lex Luthor for laughs in the SUPERMAN franchise, and the unforgettable Cloris Leachman as the repressed-but-lascivious (and possibly bestiality-inclined) Frau Blucher.And for EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND fans who know nothing about Peter Boyle beyond that show, his Monster will prove to be a true revelation. A man who was usually cast as tough guys and worse? Who knew he had so much 'funny' in him? For someone who gets very few lines (until the classic ending), Boyle's comic timing and physicality are as important to the entire movie as Wilder's, if not more so.There isn't a lot of gore or nudity, but this is one horror comedy that really can be fun for the whole family.

The only complaint I have is not really all that big, but I just find this movie is most funny during the beginning and middle while the ending, while not weak, is not as strong. Gene Wilder plays the son of the notorious Dr. Frankenstein great, at times playing his role in a straight and serious manner, then he goes off on a demented rant the next. Other characters and cast are good as well, but for my money Marty Feldman stole the show as Igor (prounced eye-gor here of course). From his scene in the basement posing as one of the heads on display to his bad choice in brains, he was the highlight in this movie for me along with the brief, but also very memorable performance of Gene Hackman as a blind man who asks god for just someone to stop by and visit him. The story is very basic Frankenstein with the strange Mel Brooks flair added in for fun. Many funny scenes are to be found within as this comedy still holds up and stands the test of time.

It was a Saturday night and I had no plans and this was before I had gotten a roommate. So I went over to the nearest Blockbusters and looked for a couple of classics. I ended up renting 'Five Easy Pieces' and 'Young Frankenstein' and it ended up being a pretty good night since I had three important ingredients, pizza, beer and a barrel of laughs.I love the way Mel Brooks tackled the original James Whale classics (Frankenstein from 1931 & Bride of Frankenstein from 1935) which are in my opinion the greatest monster classics ever to be put on screen.This film looks so authentic that it actually feels like a 1930's monster film, except of course for all the comedy. It has everything it needs to make a perfect classic comedy work A terrific performance (Gene Wilder), a hot babe (Teri Garr), the creature himself (Peter Boyle) and one of the funniest characters in motion picture history, Igor which unlike in the original is pronounced Eye-Gor (Martin Pidman).The story begins when Fredrick Fronkensteen (Gene Wilder) gets a visit from a strange old man who brings him the will of his great grandfather, 'Baron Bofort von Frankenstein'. He then of course goes to his great grandfather's old castle which actually looks exactly like the castle in the original picture from 1931 because in fact it is a picture of the castle from the original film.He there meets the care taker of the castle named Frau Bl√ºcher (Cloris Leachman) in which she is so creepy that every time her name is said, the horses begin to whinny. Now that is very funny. At first he doesn't want to face the facts of his grandfather's work but when he finds his grandfather's secret library and starts to read his books he figures it out It&#133; could&#133; work!So of course he walks in the foot steps of his grandfather and sets out to create the creature. As told by his grandfather's books, the creature must be of gigantic stature, everything must be increased in size and of course then, he would have an enormous schwanstugel in which I-Gor replies, he's gonna be very popular! But of course the creature doesn't set out to be as smart as they anticipated and this obviously leads to bigger laughs, like when he visits the blind man played brilliantly by Gene Hackman.I watched this film again last night with a good friend of mine and who happened to be a fan of Mel Brooks. I guaranteed him a great time and believe me he wasn't disappointed. It was just as great for me as it was the time I saw it, if not better, It's one of the best American comedies of our time.

I Am a Creature with an Abnormal Brain","Date":"20 April 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, sorry it is actually Fronkensteen, obviously is a homage/parody to the film produced by Universal in 1931 and based upon the novel of Mary Shelley. It was shot in black and white and also has the opening credits sequence with the style of the old films. Anyway, the plot is about Victor Frankenstein's grandson, the Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) who travels to the property of his family, that he has inherited, in Transylvania. There he meets his servant Igor (Marty Feldman), Frau Bl√ºcher (Cloris Leachman) and his assistant Inga (Teri Garr). Soon Frederick will find the old infamous laboratory of his grandfather and the secrets of how he created life from dead bodies.The are many hilarious situations in this film but the way that Mel Brooks paid homage to the Universal classic makes that this film has not an hilarious thing every minute and, for example, the beginning is a little slow just with Igor causing many laughs and with the hilarious situation of the different pronunciations. Later the film is pure story, which is good, with the lead character becoming just like Victor Frankenstein and when finally the creature (Peter Boyle) is alive is when my favourite part of the film begins. For me the most hilarious sequences in the entire film are when the creature meets the young girl, the blind man (Gen Hackman) and when Frederic presents him to the community. That scene with the blind man is definitely one of my favourites scenes of a Mel Brooks film and one of those when I couldn't stop laughing and that I repeated many times. The end is also hilarious with an intelligent creature and with the doctor and his enormous schwanzstucker that makes women sings, both finding the love.The cast is great; Gene Wilder is just funny but Marty Feldman's performance is my favourite and definitely the most funny, with his crazy eyes. The support cast is also good with the beauty of Teri Garr and the hilarious cameo of the great Gene Hackman. Conclusion This is a good parody/tribute that you can show to anyone. But I have only one question is really deserved its thirteenth place on the AFI's 100 funniest American film where The Gold Rush ranks at the place 25? Well for me one thing is for sure, this Hollywoodian lists are just another opinion that can't change mine. It is funny to check them just for curiosity but I really hate when people base their own thoughts in this type of lists claiming that, for example, Annie Hall is funnier than Modern Times when actually they never watch before a film of Charles Chaplin. Anyway, I recommend Young Frankenstein for an entertaining and funny time. 8.5 out of 10Region 4 DVD opposite of the last DVD that I bought of a Mel Brooks film (Spaceballs) this single-disc edition of Young Frankenstein is really great. Contains commentaries by Brooks and company, trailers and TV spots, deleted scenes, a documentary and some errors during the filming. But the most interesting thing that I found was a couple of interviews with Marty Feldman, Gene Wilder and Cloris Leahcman, made for a Mexican show! These interviews are really bizarre and extremely funny.

Do you think of a big scary ugly man? One who everyone is afraid of? Well if that is true then I would have to say you would be somewhat right, but at the same time wrong because Frankenstein was not the monster's name. The inventors name was Frankenstein. It's funny that a lot of people get that mixed up, simply because every movie of Frankenstein was about a huge ugly monster that everyone hated, but in reality it was more about the scientist brings dead tissue back to life. At which he succeeded. This brings me to the movie Young Frankenstein. Young Frankenstein was directed by Mel Brooks who was famous for many funny as well as great films. This film was made to be a great film to add along with the other great Frankenstein films but unlike the others this one is not just about a dark and gloomy world where everyone is set out to kill the beast. Although this one is very similar it was made to make people laugh more than cry. Young Frankenstein starts out with the grandson of Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein trying to live down his grandfather's name. He doesn't speak of his grandpa or anything. He would just like to forget. Because he thinks he is nothing like him. Well turns out he has to return to Transylvania to his grandfather's castle. He gets there and is met by his grandfather's most humble houseboy Igor and his sexy assistant Inga. As well as his mysterious housekeeper Frau Blucher. Victor had always thought his grandpa's experiments to be impossible but he instantly changes his mind when he finds a book of all his grandpa's notes and experiments. He slowly begins to try to reinvent his grandfathers experiments he follows each step in chronological order. All it really took was a trip to the lab and a trip to the cemetery to get it all started again. Mel brooks did a fantastic job with this movie because it made us laugh when we would usually be offended and it was still more then just funny, it captured all the different genres of the movie as well as making it funny to watch and entertaining to see. A lot of the credit for that goes to the performances of Gene Wilder, as young Frankenstein, and Peter Boyle as the monster. They act broadly when it's required, but they also contribute tremendous subtlety and control. Boyle somehow manages to be hilarious and pathetic at the same time. Mel would do things in the film just to do them, for example, there were a couple of bloopers that were found in the movie but noticing them in the movie kind of in a way fit to Mel's style in directing. All in all I would say this movie deserves a 10. I say this because the acting was tremendous and the scenery matched exactly as it should for a movie taking place when it did. It was touching, hilarious, scary, and fun all at once!!! I think that almost all the movies by Mel Brooks deserve a 10 just because he makes every film into a masterpiece whether or not it's a parody of another film he still knows how to make it wonderful!

It's not brilliant or anything, it just makes for good entertainment.  If there is anything negative I will say though, it's the German humor.  Inga is German.  The citizens at Transylvania are German.  The one-armed police inspector (Kenneth Mars) is German.  Mel Brooks just loves poking fun at these guys, but after The Producers (where it worked) I think I'm all German'd out.  The direction is wonderful though, Brooks best directing job is done here.

When I think of material apt for laughs and parody, a modern day spoof on the Frankenstein fable doesn't leap to mind. It must have for Mel Brooks. Sure why not. Frankenstein movies have been around for ages and although their popularity has severely dropped, maybe there's some untapped comedy to be found within. Under Mel Brooks, you'd think it would be a gold mine. Not really so, at least, not for me. I'll admit I laughed or smiled a couple of times, but unfortunately, I can count those all on one hand. To use a tried and true saying, the movie has its moments, but they're too far and in between. In my mind, a really good comedy has to have at least one gut-bust no matter the type of comedy on displayed. If a movie can make me laugh that hard it's a step closer to getting a favorable word. I never gut-busted once during Young Frankenstein and I have a hard time imagining anyone doing so unless they are under the influence or laugh very easily at the simplest of things.I think it's just the material itself. It's just rather limiting is all. Where can you go with Frankenstein? Its dated and you have to try and be funny without getting stupid all the while staying within the scope of the material you're defacto lampooning. They hit the usual targets and some that are not, but most of the jokes are direct and served right in front of your face. You can see them coming and the payoff more times than not will be no more than a smile. The idea that these people are playing characters within a movie, straight laced all but once or twice - almost a movie within a movie if you will - helps set and maintain the atmosphere, its just I found little going on from a funny perspective one moment to another.I fully agree with anyone who says this film fully grabs the mood of it's intended source material, especially the choice decision of filming in B&W, but that doesn't produce laughs in itself.

The film itself is ageless - shot beautifully in black & white, and similar to holiday classic A Christmas Story, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact date that the film takes place thus allowing the film to lend itself to several time-periods.The comedy, although a bit campy at times, is effective in it's execution and works very well with the dark, Victorian setting of the film. Gene Wilder is superb as Frederick Von Fron-ken-steen the brilliant neuro-surgeon and grandson of Victor Von Frankenstein. His charm, sharp-tongued wit and comedic timing really is a study on the craft of acting in itself. The supporting cast of actors are wonderfully cast and compliment each other perfectly, with the late Marty Feldman stealing the show as Dr. Frankenstein's loyal but slightly defiant assistant Igor.Although Young Frankenstein hasn't managed to find itself on the top of many top ten film lists, it is no doubt one of the greatest films ever produced and a joy to watch over and over again.

Starting as a writer with the Sid Ceasar -Imogene Coca TV Super series, YOUR SHOW of SHOWS (1950), Mel found steady work and progressively more success with many projects, leading up to GET SMART (1965).The Big Screened Medium then beckoned and we were treated to such cinematic treats as THE PRODUCERS (1968), THE 12 CHAIRS (1970) and in 1974 both Western Spoof Extrodinaire, BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.Being a parody of the Universal Horror Films of the 1930's and '40's, there was plenty to spoof. But a parody (or a satire or lampoon or even a burlesque, if you will)has to be carefully handled less the take-off would be so powerful as to do a number on the spoofed subject. This would likely be a desired effect in a political commercial, but not so in a film parody/comedy/farce.Collaborative writer/star, Gene Wilder and Writer/Director Mel Brooks are charged with having to carefully choose the gags and situations so as to bring the greatest number of genuine laughs, and at the same time maintain a respect and reverence for the old Horror Genre. Judging by the final product, Messers Brooks and Wilder must have been big fans of the Universal Pictures' films of that period. The delicate balance between fun and ridicule is maintained , all to the good.The Cast of Gene Wilder, Terri Garr, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn , Cloris Leachman and Blind Hermit, Gene Hackman all are up to the occasion of the day. Veteran actors Rolfe Sedan, Liam Dunn and Oscar Beregi all do yeoman's jobs in supporting, pivotal roles.The big surprise of the film and perhaps giving the greatest comic performance of his career is Mr. Kenneth Mars. His characterization of Police Inspector Kemp is the scene stealer of the whole film. He provides an actor who is up to the high level of the comic writing.* The sets for the film were all in keeping with the old Universal Pictures' practice of filming the 'scary' movies in both a Medieval Castle Set and in some realistic looking European Village digs.** In some respect, the scenery appeared uncannily the same.YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN also boasted of Original, Old Frankenstein Laboratory Equipment.***Its presence cannot be given enough credit for giving the finished Film the 'just perfect' touch.Lastly, we read recently that the 20th Century-Fox suits wanted and even insisted on filming in 'Living Color'. Both Brooks and Wilder were insistent, even obstinate, on using glorious Black & White. (the Fox people may have also just presumed that it would be a color film, because, hey, nobody made B & W movies then!) Mr. Brooks and Mr. Wilder reasoned that the B & W film was the right way to go, because that was the predominant medium used the '30's and '40's. Luckily, for sake of the production, and, we the people who make up the movie going public. So, the film story starts out with scene and gag, ever moving along at a finely timed, yet mad pace. There is no wasted time, no 'padded' or extending of a scene its optimum length.For a Film Comedy (or Farce, if you will) it is near perfection. And as for its being a spoof, ditto and 4 Stars for YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.* We know that film success is a collaborative effort of Writer, Director and Actor. In the final analysis, a poor performance by any Actor can and will render the part failed.** Universal had a really great Medieval Castle set , which got plenty of use in their Horror Genere films, featured in FRANKENSTEIN & sequels, Dracula & Sequels and THE WOLFMAN. The great German Village set, constructed for ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1930), was used frequently and shot from every different conceivable angle, in just about every classic Horror film of theirs.*** A Special Thank You was included in the credits for providing original, old Frankenstein Lab Equipment of his, which dated to the 1930's.

Hardly a moment went by when I didn't laugh out loud, or should I say scream with laughter. The scenes got funnier and funnier as the movie progressed.

Nothing could be finer than Spaceballs or Blazing Saddles, though, truth be told, I didn't find much to laugh about in Young Frankenstein. I'm older now and find it difficult to sit through the former two films; I love Young Frankenstein. It's a riotous send-up of those 1930s Universal monster movies (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolf Man, etc.), following one Frederick Frankenstein as he returns to his family's native land and begins following in his grandfather's god-playing footsteps. Those familiar with the Frankenstein films will know the story; heck, everyone's probably familiar with the story. It's also an extremely affectionate film. It mocks those often self-serious horror movies, but it loves them too, recreating the mood they evoked through glorious cinematography and stylized acting. Young Frankenstein isn't, then, a mean-spirited satire. It's more like when you're sitting next to a friend and nudge them in the side, recalling you remember that time you _fill in the blank_. Man that was funny.Why is Young Frankenstein funny? It's good joke to dud ratio is amazingly high; Brooks was, as they say in sports, in the zone. Every gag (nice knockers, roll in the hay, it's FRONKenstein, etc.) hits its mark, it seems, and there are wonderful set pieces too (the blind man in the woods and putting on the ritz numbers come to mind). The movie also looks like it was made with some attention to detail. You typically don't come away from a Mel Brooks movie remembering the framing and photography; with Young Frankenstein, you do. It's a credit to Brooks for taking more time and concerning himself with cinematic matters and not just the humor. Unfortunately, the quality of Mel Brooks's films deteriorated quickly after Young Frankenstein. High Anxiety and History of the World had their moments, but after that Brooks became, it seemed, a caricature of himself. Spaceballs was, really, 10 years too late to be an effective farce; Men in Tights was similarly misguided; and do not ask me about Dracula Dead and Loving It. I have actually not seen Silent Movie, which, I have heard, is quite good. It's really too bad. Mel Brooks showed with Young Frankenstein that he could make a great movie; looking at the film in the continuum of his films now, though, it seems more like a fluke than an artistic maturation.

It is a really funny film, with many classic moments as well as jokes and gags. It can also be considered one of the earliest Spoof films (like Airplane!), since it spoofs the older Frankenstein films.One of the things that I loved about this movie is the way all the scenes were made. Many scenes are funny in an old-fashioned way, such as the scene where Inga (Teri Garr) is rolling in a wagon full of hay while singing roll, roll, roll in the hay! Other scenes can be a bit frightening, like the scene where the Monster is attacking the policemen in a stage-theater full of screaming people. Some scenes are extremely hilarious, such as the scene where the Monster burns his thumb and screams with his mouth open! Another thing I really loved about the movie is the actors & actresses' perfect associations with their character. All the stars were fit to play their roles in the movie, especially Marty Feldman as the creepy-looking-but-humorous Igor. Also, Teri Garr was gorgeous as the lovely blonde Inga. Kenneth Mars was pretty good as Inspector Kemp, too.The reason why many people have never seen Young Frankenstein is probably because they weren't too fond of seeing a movie without color, since the film was purposely made in black & white (even though the film was released in 1974, when Hollywood used color in movies). The film-makers made the film in black & white because they wanted the film to have a more classic feel to it. Plus, using black & white actually spoofs the older Frankenstein movies more. Also, I myself liked it in black & white.To sum up, Young Frankenstein is truly one of the best comedy (and possibly spoof) films of all time. It's a golden classic that will be remembered for years to come. If you haven't seen Young Frankenstein yet, I highly recommend it.

It's ostensibly a parody of the 1931 classic Frankenstein movie and its many sequels, but even someone who is only vaguely familiar with the Frankenstein story can thoroughly enjoy this movie.The film features talented performers at their absolute best. Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks wrote a script filled with funny lines and situations. Wilder also plays the title character and delivers a performance full of manic energy. Marty Feldman (Igor) provides a delightful insouciance as the world's happiest hunchback. Special mention needs to be made of Peter Boyle, who was cast as the monster. Playing a mute creature in a bulky costume, Boyle must do much of his acting with only his eyes, and he effectively conveys an endearing bewilderment in the powerful monster. The scene where the monster visits a lonely blind man (played by Gene Hackman) is as funny as anything I've seen in a movie.Young Frankenstein isn't quite perfect. Wilder and Brooks have said in interviews that they weren't sure how to end the movie, and in fact the characters stray far from their established personalities to fit in some gags. That violates a rule of comedy, that the gags must fit the characters and not the other way around, but by the time this happens, the movie has built up so much goodwill, it is easily forgivable.

Mel Brooks' classic, Young Frankenstein, is in black and white and looks like it could have been the sequel to the Frankenstein movies of the 1930s, and that's a complement. The black and white, the use of the original sets from the famous movies all add up to a visual delight. This movie would not have worked if it were in color. The lighting is too dark for successful color, so the decision to shoot in black in white was perfect and gives the movie a wonderful visual style. The story isn't bad either. Gene Wilder plays the grandson of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein (Wilder also wrote the movie) who finds out the secret that brought the monster to life to begin with. With help from his assistants Igor (a very funny Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr), Frankenstein is able to bring Peter Boyle, he plays the monster, back to life. There are other funny performances, Cloris Leachman is the Frankenstein house sitter who may or may not have had a relationship with horses, Gene Hackman as the blind man in the woods (directly out of The Bride of Frankenstein in the movie's best parody), Kenny Mars as the town detective who had a wooden arm, and a Brooks' favorite, Madeline Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's lover, who may have found love in an unexpected place at the end of the movie. Not as consistently funny as Blazing Saddles, which came out earlier in 1974, or as socially biting as The Producers, Young Frankenstein is still a wonderful homage to the monster movies of the 1930s and 40s, with a great black and white look that reminds us of what movies used to be.

It's with no embarrassment that I admit that comedy is my favorite movie genre and most of my favorite movies are comedies. What's more, when evaluating how good a comedy is, I give more weight to how funny it really is, rather than how well-acted or well-directed or even (much of the time) original it is. If it makes you laugh, then I feel it's done its job, and that's what matters.I'm simply saying all this because Young Frankenstein is not simply one of my favorite comedies ever; it is one of my favorite movies ever. I wrote a comment about Blazing Saddles where I mentioned the fact that it came out the same year as Young Frankenstein, and both movies had the same director (the GREAT Mel Brooks) and the same star (the INCOMPARABLE Gene Wilder, also co-writer). They also happen to both be among the funniest movies of all time, which is an incredible achievement.Between the two, I give the edge to Young Frankenstein; it's my favorite among Brooks's movies, and second only to Airplane! (by those other founding fathers of the spoof, Zucker Abrahams and Zucker) on my list of greatest comedies of all time. And this movie IS well-acted, well-directed, and (in its way) original. In fact, there's much to love about this movie besides how funny it is. But it also happens to be side-splittingly hilarious, and that's what gives it the edge over other comedies.The cast is led by Gene Wilder, who plays Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced FRONK-en-steen, so as to differentiate himself from his infamous grandfather). Frankenstein is a serious scientist who never went for his grandfather's kooky theories about reanimating the dead and resents the connection people make upon hearing his name. But when he finds out that his grandfather's castle has been left to him in his will, he is forced to take a trip out to Transylvania. In Transylvania he is met by Igor (who prefers to go by the pronunciation Eye-gor, but obviously only to mock his boss). Igor is the descendant of the original Dr. Frankenstein's servant, and comes to serve Frederick while he's in Transylvania. Played by Marty Feldman, he's the only character who seems fully aware of the goofiness all around him; he is comic relief in a movie that is already a comedy. And with those unbelievable eyes, all he had to do was look at the camera and he could get a laugh. RIP, Marty Feldman.Frederick also meets hot-blooded Inga (Teri Garr putting on a ridiculous German accent; hands down the best thing she's ever done PERIOD) upon his arrival, and they head to the castle where they meet Frau Blucher, the caretaker. Frau Blucher is played by Cloris Leachman, who of course is always funny. This sets up one of the best running gags in the movie; every time someone says her name, the horses whinny.At first, Frederick resists his grandfather's research. But after Inga wakes him up from a nightmare, they hear violin music, and find a secret passageway that leads to the original Frankenstein's laboratory. On the way down they also run into Igor, but don't find out who was playing the violin (which they do find, unattended and still warm, along with a smoldering cigar). They do, however, find Frederick's grandfather's notes (including a book titled How I Did It). Reading these notes, Frederick decides that bringing life to the dead could work after all, and sets to work digging up corpses and sending Igor for a brain (he breaks the one he was supposed to get and picks up an abnormal one instead). And so Frederick, Igor, and Inga set to work on their grand experiment.At first, it doesn't seem to work. But when the creature does finally come to life, it's a crazy monster. It escapes, the townspeople (led by Kenneth Mars as Inspector Kemp, and he is hilarious as usual) want to kill it, and they have to get it back.As I'm writing this, it is three days past Peter Boyle's death, and this is a pity. The world will be a bit less funny without him. He was pitch-perfect as the monster, making it every bit as much his own as Boris Karloff did in the original. He commented once that this was his favorite part of his. His ability getting laughs with just some exaggerated movements, subtle facial expressions and groans was without peer, and the bit where he and Frederick are on stage singing Puttin on the Ritz is among the funniest scenes in movie history.The cast is rounded out by Madeline Khan as Frederick's virginal fianc√© Elizabeth. Madeline Khan was an extremely funny woman and although she doesn't have much screen time in this movie, she makes her time count. RIP, Madeline Khan.And Gene Hackman must be mentioned as well. I've always been a huge fan of Hackman's, and although his cameo as the blind man isn't his best part ever, it is his funniest, and makes for some of the funniest bits in the movie (Come back! I was going to make espresso! he yells out as the monster runs screaming from his house).What makes this movie work so well is that it almost seems to take itself seriously. It has an original plot that pays homage to the original Universal pictures with nearly every scene. It's shot in black-and-white, and everything, including the haunting score, Gothic cinematography, and set-pieces, many of which came from the original pictures, is meant to evoke Frankenstein movies of old. It's this hushed level of reverence to the originals juxtaposed with the hilariousness of the script and over-the-top performances of the actors that really sets this movie apart. It is a work of genius in every way.RIP, Peter Boyle, Oct 18 1935 - Dec 12 2006.

It is one of those rare films that everyone is at their top of game and they're able to produced masterpiece. We got Gene Wilder, whose is truly superb as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, whose kept insisting on Fronkensteen. Marty Feldman is damn hilarious as Eye-Gor. Madeleine Kahn is as funny as Wilder's fianc√©e. Teri Garr is so hot as assistant to Wilder. Cloris Leachman is very amusing as Wilder's grandfather's mistress Blucher, whose like to abusing the horses in her spare time. Mel Brooks' direction is great and I think 1974 really belong to him because he had Blazing Saddles come out earlier that year.The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking in Young Frankenstein because it managed to replicate original vision of Frankenstein, which is very impressive. Also, it was very smart of them using black and white photography because it only enhanced the film even more and give it timeless feeling. One can watch it over and over and still miss the sight gags because the pace is pretty fast so you have to be on your toes, which isn't something that you can say about comedies these days. You can notice that many people whose are working on Young Frankenstein really enjoy making it a lot and I heard a story that when principal photography was almost complete, which saddens many crew members so Brooks had wrote extra scenes so they can have more fun. I don't think you will see that type of stuff these days. Actors in Hollywood are only interesting in money so they just memorized the lines then film it then leave it. The results are that it won't probably turn out as good as Young Frankenstein.The set design is just plain out awesome and in fact, it is same location that they had shot original Frankenstein on, which makes it very interesting experience. Some guy whose had worked on original Frankenstein was willing to return back to fix some old sets for Young Frankenstein and even updating some of those equipments, which is really neat. It just makes you feel like that you're truly there to experience whole thing.The difference between Young Frankenstein and satires or parodies are that Young Frankenstein paid homage to films that it is based on then poke fun with them, not at. Young Frankenstein was done out of love for original Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and the book that had start it all by Mary Shelley. Perhaps, that's why I really enjoy Young Frankenstein a lot because it doesn't reduced original Frankenstein to ashes like other satires or parodies does.One performance that I admired the hell a lot is Kenneth Mars, whose played Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friederich Kemp. Mars could have made that role as merely fiddle to solid casts but he did something very different with that role, which is very amusing. That arm of his, don't get me start on that. It's great sight gag and I always laughing at that when he has to use that arm of his to make his points or to deceiving Wilder. Also, Mars add something new to his character, which he made his character talk very funny. It resulted in really hilarious situation when mob couldn't make out what he had said and Mars had to stress on what he had say. But I also like Peter Boyle's performance as The Monster. There is so something about child about Boyle's character. I don't know what is it about that but all I know is that it always end up in hilarious situation like when he went to Gene Hackman's house and I always roared with laughter at that part.It's been awhile since I had receiving Young Frankenstein as present but I will always cherish it because it turn me bona fide film buff that I am today.

Peter Boyle is a hoot as The Monster, as is Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher (cue horse sounds), Kenneth Mars as Police Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friedrich Kemp (you may recall the screwy arm), and of course Gene Hackman as the Blind Man (espresso, anyone?).

Everyone (Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr, Gene Hackman, Kenneth Mars) sparkles in their own realm of dementia here--especially Wilder, whose brand of mayhem uncorks at whim and sometimes sends us scurrying for cover! It's a very funny--and yet serious--spoof of the Frankenstein movies, with humor that derives from our nostalgia and the set replicas as much from the dialogue. The plot is (intentionally) familiar, but the script isn't always so predictable, throwing the audience a curve-ball now and again, yet the cast and director/co-writer Mel Brooks almost always manage to stay on track. Wilder teamed with Brooks on the screenplay, and there was a small feud about who did most of the work; consequently, they never did another picture together. It was their loss as well as ours, for despite some OK films (Wilder's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother and Brooks' Silent Movie), neither reached the heights they climbed with Young Frankenstein. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"One of the funniest films ever made!","Date":"30 December 2003","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The scariest comedy of all time! boasted the poster taglines for Young Frankenstein. When a tagline pokes fun at itself, you know you're in for a real treat. Such is the case with Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, one of the greatest of all comedies and one of the only modern day films able to convince me from the start that I really was watching an old 30s film, and not a film made in 1974.Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are both fans of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and so when they collaborated to write the screenplay for Young Frankenstein, I can only assume that it was a fun experience for both of them. They reworked the story of Frankenstein and his monster into a smart, occasionally hilarious, always enjoyable, classic comedy that helped put Brooks on the map after The Producers (Blazing Saddles also helped quite a bit).Some fans of Frankenstein could consider the film almost sacrilegious, I suppose, but that wouldn't be fair. It's not a poke at any flaws in Frankenstein -- it's a well-thought-out continuation of Baron von Frankenstein's legacy, with an added pinch of slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure.Gene Wilder is Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Frahnk-un-steen, not Frank-en-steyn), grandson of the crazy old loon Baron von Frankenstein, who attempted to re-animate dead matter in his creepy mansion in Transylvania years ago. Frederick is a successful neurosurgeon, eager to put his past behind him. When a student asks him questions about his grandfather and research into re-animation, he is quick to change the subject.Then he inherits his grandfather's castle in Transylvania and makes the long, weary journey there to acquire ownership. Greeted by Igor (pronounced Eegor, not Eyegor), Frederick Frankenstein is soon haunted by his grandfather's interests. I guess the craving for re-animating dead tissue is just something that runs in one's blood!He stumbles upon an old chamber underneath the crumbling mansion, home to an assortment of odd inventions and textbooks (including How I Did It, by Baron von Frankenstein, which is a bit of an in-joke for readers of Mary Shelley's story -- they'll understand the joke, perhaps, more than most audiences).After finding a dead body in a graveyard and accidentally inserting an Abby Normal brain into it from the help of Igor (Marty Feldman), Frederick Frankenstein creates a new Monster (Peter Boyle), who is taken into custody by the townspeople and then escapes, finding an old blind man (Gene Hackman) in a cabin somewhere. He then kidnaps Frederick's bride to take her as his own and Frederick realizes that he must put an end to the Monster before everything in his life falls apart.There isn't much to say about a film like this. The comedy works, the style works, everything about it works. It's classic. Everything in it is classic Mel Brooks comedy.I suppose the accounts of Brooks' and Wilder's off-screen fights during filming are pretty well known. In one instance, Brooks got so mad at Wilder that he threw an object at him. Later he called Wilder and said, Who was that jerk that threw that thing at you today? He should be fired!It was because the two minds clashed together. Both being extreme fans of Frankenstein, I suppose both men had their own unique opinions as to what, exactly, the film should be about, and what, exactly, should happen in it. But for whatever the reason, despite all their arguments the film has turned into a masterpiece.Wilder's performance is extraordinary. After turning Leo Bloom (The Producers) into a nervous, paranoid, timid man, Wilder does a 180 here and makes Frankenstein into a self-assured, mean, forthright character --  giving us the feeling that he's been hassled his entire lifetime by nosy reporters researching into his grandfather's case, and he's tired of it.Filmed on-location in the original Frankenstein set, the film partly works because of its respect for the old horror films. The famous Universal horrors from the 1930s and 40s are spoofed in this film, and that is primarily is what truly makes it stand out from the other films in the genre. But Brooks and Wilder don't insult them. They compliment them and poke fun with them -- not at them.Brooks tried this formula once again in 1995 with Dracula Dead and Loving it!, which starred Leslie Nielsen as Count Dracula, although the outcome was not as smart as Young Frankenstein and not as convincing. Brooks did a great thing by filming Young Frankenstein in grainy 30-style black and white, reminiscent of old films such as Dracula or The Wolf Man or Frankenstein itself (not coincidentally, Brooks makes more than a few references to other Universal horror films, too). Part of the greatness of this film is the manner in which it is filmed. I can't imagine Young Frankenstein in color. But then again, I can't really imagine Spaceballs in black and white...5/5 stars.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Fantastic.

It isn't quite the funniest movie ever made, but it's damn close. The comedy is laugh out loud, over the top hilarious, but it never resorts to cheap slapstick. As a matter of fact, if you removed a couple of scenes and turned off the volume, this could pass for a real Frankenstein movie. That's how well the satire is done.Mel Brooks does a great directing job, but the film belongs to his cast. I can't think of any comedy with a finer cast than this one, in particular Gene Wilder as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein. Wilder was excellent in the Producers and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but this is the high point of his career. He delivers one of the finest and most memorable comedic performances in history. His performance actually works as a strong 40's or 50's style dramatic performance as well as a comedic performance. Even though he doesn't quite beat Wilder, Marty Feldman is absolutely terrific in his role as the hunchback Igor. I would be unfair to disregard Madeline Kahn as Dr. Frankenstein's fianc√©e, or Teri Garr's sublime portrayal of the typical blond bombshell typecast. Peter Boyle is also very good as the Monster.The script is very good, but it's the electrifying chemistry within the cast that makes this so funny.

For starts the cast is the Monty Pythons, wow, they are for sure some of the funniest people ever to walk to earth so this movie can not be bad. The quotes, the slapstick and the timing is almost flawless and the fact that more than half a century later, we still laugh out loud with this jewel ,shows that what is funny stays funny. To go to the plot, the grandson of the original Frankenstein is called to come to the ancestral castle of his house and he, though he wants to distance himself from the family history, goes and in the end the traditional lunacy of the Frankensteins can not be put under control. To write more it would a spoil ,so go watch it. The parody part is the fact that takes a well known story and makes fun of its main elements, in this case the clich√©s of the mad scientist and Gothic horror with great effect as well as say it own story and makes us care for what with happen. The later part is where the most parodies lose and become in all honest a dumb ,offencive movie( Meet the Spartan or Superhero Movie anyone?) ,but here we thankfully do not have to deal with that. In summary, is a flick that you have to see before you die.

Gene Wilder stars as Dr. Frederich Frankenstein, the grandson of the infamous Baron Von Frankenstein who created his monster which terrorized villagers years before. When Frederich inherits his grandfather's castle he stumbles upon the baron's work and sets out to create his own monster in the name of science. This film is what screwball comedy is all about. It is a uproariously hilarious ride that delivers one hilariously quotable line after the next.There is a right way and a wrong way to do screwball comedy. Mel Brooks knows the right way and he hits it right on the nose with Young Frankenstein. The absurdity and silliness of this film never feels out of place and it always fits just right with the pacing of the film. This is a very goofy and off the wall kind of film but there's something about it that is just so damn funny. I would have to say it starts with the eccentric cast of characters all played to perfection by their actors. Gene Wilder plays up the mad scientist clich√© just enough to where it becomes a joke in and of itself, spoofing the mad scientist stereotype just right. Marty Feldman plays Igor in what is possibly the most hilarious role in the entire film. From hitting on Frankenstein's fianc√©e to having his hump switch shoulders constantly everything he says and does makes me laugh.The two female leads are also hysterical. Madeline Kahn is so incredibly over the top, yet a lot of her humor is subtle, at least as subtle as any screwball humor gets. Teri Garr plays Inga, who has the most ridiculous German accent, making every last thing she says a joke. Cloris Leachman even has a small role as Frau Blucher, a role that is almost more creepy than it is funny. Then of course Peter Boyle plays the monster in a Frankenstein performance to rival Boris Karloff. It's the nuttiest portrayal of the creature ever but his scenes are some of the funniest of the entire film. The absence of Mel Brooks as a character in the film was a little disappointing but there's nothing to be done about that.You have to go into Young Frankenstein with a very open mindset because it is incredibly nonsensical and ridiculous, just like any great screwball comedy. If you waste time questioning the logic of this film one, you will make an idiot out of yourself, and two, you won't be able to enjoy the film nearly as much. This is one of the silliest films ever made, as is to be expected from Mel Brooks, but it is incredibly fun and you won't see a spoof pulled off nearly as well as this in a long, long time.

This film is steadily funny throughout with everything from slapstick to subtle innuendo to a musical number to visual and verbal puns. Of course it's all the more enjoyable if you've seen the classic Frankenstein movies previously. In terms of cinematography, this black-and-white film is one of the best executed, most beautiful films imaginable. The mise-en-scene is exquisitely adept with opulent room settings filling the frame to the brim, a cobweb-strewn towering laboratory shot at oblique angles and even the use of a circular convex mirror to reveal action. The contrast range from the whitest white to the darkest black is incredible and the night scenes are breathtaking. All this in a movie that is actually funny! All the actors do a commendable job. Worth noting is Gene Hackman's brief standout performance as the blind man. Needless to say, no spoof/homage to the classic horror film will ever come close to this awesome achievement. This is probably one of the best films ever made and Mel Brooks can rest assured that it will be the vanguard of his legacy for generations to come. "},{"Title":"Mel Brooks' Finest Film","Date":"8 April 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Young Frankenstein stands above other parody comedies because it makes sure that the humor is not the center of the film. The film makes the jokes a subtext to the story, characters and the atmosphere. The humor is executed trough these elements, and it not only makes the film hilarious, but also compelling, polished and memorable. The film stars Gene Wilder as Frederick Frankenstein, the grandson son of the original Frankenstein, who his highly skeptical of his grandfather's work. He journeys to Transylvania after inheriting his family's castle and eventually becomes his grandfather's successor. The story follows closely to the original Frankenstein and some of its early sequels, and it works just as well as the humor. The film could almost work as a drama as well as comedy. Gene Wilder gives a spectacular performance as Frankenstein. Wilder specializes in acting as eccentric brilliant psychopaths with a strong sense of charm and morality. He performed perfectly as Willy Wonka in 1971 and does the same here. Marty Feldman plays his loyal accomplice Igor, easily the funniest character in the film. Feldman manages to make Igor fun and innocent, yet takes him just seriously enough so he doesn't lose his credibility. Peter Boyle plays the monster, whom he gives a layer of playful innocence to accompany his enormous, powerful and frightening demeanor. It'll take forever to cover the entire supporting cast, yet they are all spectacular. The film is completely shot in black and white and successfully recreates the horror atmosphere of the films from the 1930s. The art direction makes the setting creepy and dark, yet lighthearted at the same time. The films humor is difficult to describe but it's a good balance of physical, verbal and story-centric comedy. The film doesn't go out of its way to be funny and the humor never feels campy or over the top. The laughs are evenly distributed and properly delivered in all three acts and the film never feels lopsided; something that a majority of comedies, even the most acclaimed, often suffer from. Young Frankenstein is simply a film where everything works, and it works really well. For any fan or comedy or horror, Young Frankenstein is a must watch.

Inga is played by Teri Garr. Teri Garr looks terrific in gorgeous black and white. I actually had a hard time following the movie because I've always been in love with Teri Garr. She wears I think eight or ten different dresses or outfits. The remastering of the movie is outstanding.In the beginning of this famous Mel Brooks flick, Frankenstein, son of THE Frankenstein, is a rather crabby and exasperated man, his own nemesis in a way because he doesn't want to be compared to his father. But after finding the laboratory in the old castle(ran by Frau Blucher), he becomes a different person, a different scientist. He longs to re-animate flesh, in addition to having a desire to jump Inga's bones. The feeling is mutual. Back home, wherever that is(never read Shelley's book) is his fianc√©, a woman who makes the Doctor wait until their wedding night. Her name is Elizabeth(Madeliene Kahn) and her parents are rich. She is somewhere between a very slowly melting iceberg and a haughty tease. But she catches Igor's eye(both of them belonging to British actor Marty Feldman). Which is very incidental, however the little guy does make a go of it, making light of it all the while. Igor's big mission is going to the brain depository in the little German town. I wondered today why the good doctor did not go, but it's one of many things that one finds at the local library when not searching for early Stephen King books. Those old Boris Karloff and Peter Cushing movies are a trick to find; I used to stay up late when I was a kid to see them.Inspector Kemp(played by Kenneth Mars) has problems himself, but he never died and was brought back to life. He is mostly mechanical above the waist. He also has an a way of expressing himself that apparently means he had some neurological speech impediment. Which is funny as hell, in the movie. Sometime during the movie Frankenstein asks Inga to elevate him, where that goes you know, if you have seen the movie. The monster, disturbed by fire during a performance for the town, gets Elizabeth to go out to the country with him. He now has fire under control, and Elizabeth finds out after another cigarette that The Monster is the most gifted man in the world. She says seven has always been my lucky number.After some schnapps the think tank goes back to the lab, and something miraculous is about to happen.

The characters feel like more than just caricatures and you come to care for them, especially Peter Boyle. Brooks also holds back on the anachronisms or breaking-the-fourth-wall that became the trademarks of his other works. While most of Brooks' other films just parody a genre, I really feel that Young Frankenstein actually works fine as story on its own. This is similar to how The Princess Bride is a good spoof of fairy tales, but works fine as a fairy tale on its own.Whenever I think of Young Frankenstein, I don't find myself thinking of the off-the-wall, laugh-out-loud-every-minute comedy that I do for The Producers or Blazing Saddles. The humor here is a little more restrained and subtle (not always, of course. The brain depository is just as outrageous as anything else).

Marty Feldman in my opinion was just so absolutely loony that every time you saw Igor on screen you just had to chuckle at his goofy antics. One of my favorite parts of the film would have to be when the good doctor asks Igor what brain he had gotten. Igor responds by saying Abby&#x85;. Abby something&#x85;. Oh yeah Abby normal. Also I think that the parody of the sheriff was rather humorous. The way they over exaggerated his accent to make him have to repeat himself was classic. Also the over use of his fake arm was rather amusing. The dance number with the monster where they sing the famous song Putting on the Ritz was especially amusing because you got to see a randomly placed song and dance number in the middle of him trying to put on a great scientific display.

Whatever you think about him, you just cannot ignore his style of film-making and his great observational skills. It is an accepted fact that in order to truly enjoy spoofs, one has to watch the original movie first. But in case of Mel Brooks, his spoof movies can be viewed individually and they have their own comic impact. Young Frankenstein is one such work of Brooks which many consider his best. Young Frankenstein is a tribute to the Frankenstein movies from 1930 onwards. Character names have been changed but any one who has seen the original can identify the character. The movie has also been entirely shot in Black & White to give that 1930's feel. The movie has it's comic moments consistently and it keeps the viewer n splits. Mel Brook's observational quality has helped him to take notice of small things in the original and spoof them that others wouldn't have noticed. On the acting front, all actors have imitated the acting of the Black & White era, trying to over-dramatize things which adds to the comic quotient. Gene Wilder who is also the co-writer looks like a man possessed when he carries out his part.

Directed by renowned comedy filmmaker Mel Brooks, with a screenplay co-written by Brooks and Gene Wilder, 1974's Young Frankenstein is a spoof/homage to the Universal horror movies of the 1930's, specifically the Frankenstein ones. The movie was an absolute success, and is clearly still very popular 35 years later. It was released over a decade before I was born, but in recent years, I've learned about Brooks and several of his films. Knowing this was one of the films he is best known for, I decided to watch it this month, and it certainly wasn't what I could call unfunny or forgettable! Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is a teaching neurosurgeon and the grandson of Victor Frankenstein, who was famous for reanimating corpses. However, Frederick is so ashamed of his grandfather's work that he does not wish to be associated with him, and has even changed the pronunciation of his surname. One day, a solicitor comes to the neurosurgeon's classroom, and after the class is dismissed, Frankenstein is informed that he has inherited his family estate, a castle in Transylvania! After bidding farewell to his fianc√©e, Elizabeth, Frankenstein travels to Transylvania, where he soon meets Igor, his new hunchbacked servant. The doctor then meets Inga, who will be his new lab assistant, and Frau Bl√ºcher, another servant. During his first night in the castle, he hears mysterious violin music, and searches with Igor and Inga to find out exactly where it's coming from! During their search, Frederick discovers Victor Frankenstein's secret library and reads his journals, which suddenly changes his thoughts on reanimation! He is now determined to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and reanimate a dead body, with the assistance of Inga and Igor, but unfortunately, this is bound to lead to trouble, just like it did for Victor! There were many times I laughed while watching this film, sometimes hard and sometimes lightly. There are some comic highlights during the classroom scene around the beginning, including Frankenstein's demonstration to the class, and especially his reaction to a student's questions about his grandfather! After that, there's the farewell scene at the train station, another comic highlight, and many more follow that one. These include the part where Dr. Frankenstein and Igor first meet (with several pronunciation jokes), the doctor and Inga trying to get through the revolving bookcase, Igor startling Frankenstein and Inga after they look at the dead skulls, and so many more, some of which I would probably be giving away too much of the story if I mentioned! Not ALL the gags are hilarious, but a good number of them are. Unlike some people, I couldn't give this a 10/10 just for the humour. Gene Wilder puts on an outstanding performance as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, and Marty Feldman (Igor), Cloris Leachman (Frau Bl√ºcher), Teri Garr (Inga), Madeline Kahn (Elizabeth), Peter Boyle (The Monster), etc. are all memorable as well. Filmed in black and white, the movie also has nice cinematography, and does a great job capturing the atmosphere of the 30's horror movies! Finally, the script was well written, and as well as the humour, there's also suspense.Some viewers might say this horror spoof is hilarious from start to finish, maybe even the funniest movie of all time. I definitely can't say I agree with these statements, but I still laughed so many times, and the humour isn't all Young Frankenstein has to offer. Everything else I've mentioned about the film also helps make it what it is. It was released 35 years ago and is still popular today, so I probably haven't said anything about it that it hasn't already been praised for, and probably can't! For those who are disgusted by how low Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have sunk the spoof genre lately, then you could find that watching a spoof movie like this, from a different era, to be somewhat of a relief! Of course, I haven't seen EVERY spoof movie from recent years, and I'm sure there are good ones I've yet to see, but I know some of the ones from the past decade or so have been lame, especially if they were made by Friedberg and Seltzer! If you're a fan of classic horror movies from the 30's and have the right sense of humour to be amused by this 1974 Mel Brooks comedy, I would say you're bound to find a lot to like!

I think you can be of ANY age and appreciate a movie like that.Filmed very intentionally in black-and-white and in the slow,dissolving fashion that characterized the James Whale Frankenstein movies of the thirties,the story follows Professor Frederick Frankenstein(Gene Wilder,co-writer of the film,using his more trademark manic explosiveness here),who insists on having his name FRONK-un-SHTEEN and bristles at the association with his famous grandfather,Victor Frankenstein. Upon learning that he has inherited the castle and laboratory that belonged to his Grandfather,he travels to visit it in the old country. He meets the grandson of the original henchman,Igor,pronounced EYE-gor(Marty Feldman,all bug-eyed,hunchbacked and gamest for the folly of anyone here it seems) and becomes close with the lovely townsfraulein INga(the always fetching Teri GArr). He quickly becomes obsessed with his grandfather's work,much to the delight of his grandfather's stern housekeeper Frau Blucher(Cloris Leachman),who had a hand in the work and was had a particular love interest in the late Herr Doktor. History is about to repeat itself,as the third generation Frankenstein also creates a massive hulk made out of hanged convicts(Peter Boyle,God rest his soul,who did more with no lines),who is also a powerfully strong creation who inspires fear and anger from the already suspicious locals.My comment summary refers to the fact that I've probably seen this movie AT LEAST four times before,and first recall sitting fully through it on a NBC late summer broadcast on a Friday night in August or September,1983. I recall being very tickled by the sight-gags,verbal plays and pratfalls back then,and upon watching it very recently STILL laughing out loud at the same gags. Perhpas I was in the mood or mindset to laugh at the comic devises this time as opposed to some of the times of watched this between then and now. Whatever,all I know is that this film has an organic sense of comedy that is probably all but lost now,which is somewhat of a shame. While Mr.Brooks' work may never quite be what it used to be,the work that was IS STILL brilliant and worth adding to one's film library,particularly for those who miss older,lighter fare that has a true appreciation for film styles and genres.

When It finally came out I was way too busy to see it right away. Everybody who had seen it marveled and raved. Finally, I saw it. Hmmm. It is definitely a good film. It may be better than 'Blazing Saddles' in some film or technical way. A lot of work was put into this along with resurrecting parts of the original Karloff 'Frankenstein' laboratory set. A nice touch! Despite whatever intentions were meant by this film - it does not really complete itself as a 'horror' film. I feel that this is in the wrong category - but then maybe this film falls in-between somehow. It isn't really a drop-down-dead-funny comedy either. But it definitely has its moments. (The book shelf bit had me rolling) The story parallels and spoofs the original Karloff classic to a point. No surprise here. Thus, without getting detailed, the story is easy to follow and is peppered with Brook's humor - which I occasionally find to be hammy and kind of a-la-Jerry Lewis. It is paced nicely and is never boring but it is occasionally uneven. This may be caused my the brain trying to remember this is a horror film - or maybe the producer and director were trying to get us to remember. Not sure. The acting is superb. Every cast member is great. Yes, Wilder is over the top again - but so was the original Dr. Frankenstein (Clive). Boyle is an adequate monster. Kahn is outrageous. Leachman is especially good. Garr does well. And dear old Feldman (who dyed shortly thereafter) has many shining moments. Despite the great ensemble and acting I felt very much like I was watching a spoof the whole time. There are occasional asides to the camera that break any illusion the film ever had of creating a real horror atmosphere. I guess being filmed in B&W is supposed to help instill some of the Gothic. The camera work is right on. The background music is appropriate.There is very little that is bad about this film. It's not as funny as it could have been but that doesn't detract from the overall entertainment value. Most people should like this film. I do and I would recommend it. But not as a HORROR film - especially as high as this has gotten on this site's list.

While his best works, Young Frankenstein included, are significantly above par, his misfires fall to the level of the Zucker brothers.  Thankfully, Brooks can provide gags and humor that don't consistently insult the intelligence of the audience.Young Frankenstein is both formulaic and slashing.  The humor is a combination of the typical slapstick and mild crassness that Brooks has supplied before, but the real gem is not in the script.Gene Wilder is a comedian in the prototypical sense of the word.  He understands his lines and his character.  He also knows Brooks better than most other actors that have worked with him.  Hence, he is able to wring just about everything he can from what Brooks creates.  Marty Feldman is even better.Brooks finally exercises some use of his camera as besides a stageplay apparatus.  It was interesting counting all the subliminal touches he made to keep the mood similar to the original Frankenstein, but then tweaks it to his own suiting.Overall, a good exercise in humor worth a few laughs.  3.5 out of 5 stars.

When I first heard of it, I was skeptical.  A story about Frankenstein's grandson making a new monster didn't sound that appealing to me, but once I saw it, it was hilarious!  The characters are great, there's Dr. Frankenstein, (that's Frahnk-en-steen!), who wacky hair, obsessed nature, and habit of speaking loudly as if no one else can hear him, Igor, the bug eyed, hunch backed minion, who may just be the funniest character in the film, Inga, the often ambiguoisly seductive German assitant, Elizabeth, Frankenstein's prissy and vain girlfriend, and of course, the monster himself, who despite having very few lines is very funny with his confused fumblings, and being quite angry with everything.

I have warped sense of humor, and it shows. But this film is hilarious, but you can tell that this was more of a Wilder written film. Throughout it lacks the potty humor and off-color humor that have been constant in other Brooks films. It has some, but it has a little bit different feel to it than other ones. Yo u will find no sign of the p*** boy of History, or the racial jokes and gags found in that same years Blazing Saddles. But this is a time period when Brooks was at his finest, two of his best films, many call them his two best, came out the same year (1974) and they have become his two most successful films, both critically, and finanically. Actor wise, Peter Boyle is hilarious, his grunts and crazy looks always seem to come at the right times. The character Igor (it is pronounced I-gor, master) is my favorite, because of his eyes and remarks. Gene Wilder is good in this film also, he also comes off with some very funny looks. Madeline is funny and witty as she always is in Brooks films. (She also appeared in Mel's Blazing Saddles and History of the World, to name a couple)And Gene Hackman, he may have had a small (or should I say blind?) part in this film, but it was one of the funniest sequences in the film. I could hardly stop laughing when he was ladeling the soup for Peter Boyle. Overall, this film is a deffinate 10 out of 10. It has to be on my top two or three list for Mel Brooks films.

But this film directed by Brooks and written by Gene Wilder and Mr. Brooks, to this viewer, tops the list.  Written and played with tongue-in-cheek by a stellar cast of pros.  Let's start with Mr. Wilder himself, one of the best straight men in the business.  He knows how to set up the laugh and he definitely knows how to play it to the hilt.  Wilder brought such hilarity to his role of Frederick Frankenstein, grandson to the Baron himself.  Yet he was convincing as well.  You really believed he was earnest in his attempt to bring his monster, played by that affable Peter Doyle, in one of his most impressive roles, to life, let alone a top tap dancer in top hat and tails.  Doyle, now popular as the father in law on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, almost walks off with the picture.  His after glow scene with Madeline Kahn, smoking a cigarette was brilliant.  Speaking of Miss Kahn, she was perfection as Elizabeth, the ever so proper girl who couldn't let her lover, Wilder, touch her hair, her nails, her dress for fear of messing it up.  Kahn stole the picture. Then Marty Feldman as Igor, another brilliant performance, with those eyes of his that seem to focus in different directions, and Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher which I believe means glue in German who's mention of her name makes horses of the area neigh in terror.  She brings that Judith Anderson type character as the Housekeeper to comedic perfection. Terri Garr as Inga, the town sexpot was hilarious with her accent and body language as Wilder's love interest.  Wilder, looking at front door knobs says, What wonderful knockers to which Garr answers, Why, thank you.  Richard Haydn in a small role as the person who brings Wilder back to the home of his grandfather and encourages him to carry on the work in the laboratory, Liam Dunn as the volunteer to Wilder's class where he is used as a sort of guinea pig for an experiment was incredibly funny with out saying a word, and finally Gene Hackman, as a blind violinist, in, to me, the funniest scene in the movie, where he welcomes the monster, Doyle, by pouring hot soup in his lap, lighting his finger, thinking it's his cigar and smashing his mug of wine into the monster's hand, driving him out of the cottage.This film I can see over and over again, each time finding more things that the actors brought to their roles.  It's a classic and still holds up.

Gene Wilder is wild in this role of Fredrick Fraunkenschteen. Igor is hilarious. Scenes include Igor having great difficulty closing his eyes, scaring the horses, and getting the wrong brain, and blowing the horn. Did you know that the Ritz scene was argued over between Wilder and Brooks, Brooks lost the argument, and had this famous scene? The bookshelf scene was funny. The film spoofs other black and white hits, as THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, CASABLANCA, and the original KING KONG. My father laughed at the scene where Wilder goes to Transylvania, and talks to a shoe-shining boy, and spoofs the song Chattanooga Choo-Choo Station 59. The German guy with a creaky arm is funny, especially the part where the monster took his arm off by accident. Gene Hackman is a blind man, who clumsy actions give the monster a hard time. This answers the question What if James Whale included the blind man scene in the movie? The answer is it would look like that but only serious. Very spoofy, contains elements (even the props) of the Karloff film. The little girl, the angry mob, and getting the body, and Igor getting the brain. I saw the opening credits (but didn't see the title), and I thought it was the 1931 DRACULA with Bela Lugosi, but I was corrected when I saw that the film was directed by Mel Brooks.

The late, wonderful British comedian Marty Feldman (Igor), who turned his congenital wandering eyes into comedic foils, never misses a beat as second banana to Gene Wilder, who plays the distraught Dr. Frankenstein to the hilt and beyond. Cloris Leachman, who looks like a cross between a witch and a warlock, plays the feared housekeeper Frau Bleucher (neighhh!!!), and a very young, beautiful, and buxom Teri Garr plays the nurse-assistant to the good doctor. Then there is the marvelous Madeline Kahn, who gave a bravura performance as the doctor's fiancee. The late comedienne's burst into operatic ecstasy during her rape by the monster is simply inspired, and is one of the comedic high points of the entire film.

The scene at the dinner table following the failure to revive the creature--followed by the said-a-give game of charades. Then, we have the monster visiting the old blind man (Gene Hackman) and practically being killed by him. Finally, the presentation of the monster to the pompous scientific community--Puttin' on the Ritz. This doesn't do justice because there are bits of schtick going on . Frau Blucher, Terri Garr and her thick German accent (Moochel instead of Mutual).Marty Feldman and Abby Normal. The list goes on. This is such a gem. With Blazing Saddles, Mel Brooks didn't seem to know when to quit. This is a masterpiece and deserves to be on the same shelf as the wonderful originals.

Take a look at the scene where Dr. Frankenstein meets Igor at the train station, and the `walk this way' gag.  My friend pointed out that if you look at Igor, you see him look at the camera and tilt his head at Frankenstein as he's shuffling down the steps, sort of a `look at what I'm getting this idiot to do!' aside to the audience.  I'd watched that scene dozens of times, but I never noticed that look until then.  That's the mark of a classic, though, isn't it?  When you can watch a movie over and over and still find new details and bits of interest, it keeps the movie fresh and new. The secret of `Young Frankenstein' is respect.  The script and the actors respect the audience's intelligence, and also respect the memory of the movies they're parodying.  You can feel the affection scriptwriters Wilder and Brooks have the original Frankenstein movies, and `Young Frankenstein' almost functions as condensed highlights of the classic Universal films.  The end result is a gentle ribbing of those movies (which didn't always take themselves too seriously to begin with) and one of the funniest comedies ever.

In almost every scene he is in, he steals it with such enthusiasm it makes you wish he had made many more films.One of the two places I spoke of earlier is the Transylvannia Station scene.  I just don't think it's relevant enough for many people to get in this day.

Not surprisingly I couldn't really see what was going on and had to guess. As soon as I heard the scary music at the start I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it- it's the same feeling I got watching the Halloween episodes of Bugs Bunny, the ones where the scary green witch tries to eat him. Brrr, I'm getting spooky just thinking about it. The film seems to be about a crazy scientist whose children die in some sort of freak electrical accident, possibly involving a lighthouse. The scientist wants to bring his kids back from the dead and believes he can do this by taking the best body parts from each and stitching them together. There are various terrifying scenes of him lurking through graveyards and Undertaker's houses so that he can acquire all the extra parts he needs. Eventually he builds a son for himself but it still needs life. As everyone knows 300 millilitres of electricity (Stat!) blown into the heart and brain at the same time is enough to bring any living thing back from the dead- of course in real life this vary rarely happens. He does it and his son is reborn again. They are both crazy though, the creature doesn't know if he is one person or various considering all the different bits which make him up. Naturally he goes on a rampage and throws lots of other children into lakes with lawnmowers attached to them. This was never fully explained and (pardon the pun) struck me as a little strange. I don't want to talk anymore about this as it is too scary. I might watch it again when I'm thirty, as when you're 28 you shouldn't be watching scary movies like this; You should be watching films with explodings and boobs, and playing Guitar Heroes.Best Scene When the monster breaks into Strictly Come Dancing and does a foxtrot with Brucie before mauling Bruno to death.

Besides Wilder, it stars Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Teri Garr, Peter Boyle and Cloris Leachman, all of whom are hilarious. Kahn is the wealthy fianc√©e of Dr. F, who sees him off at the train station as he leaves to collect his inheritance of the Frankenstein castle and his grandfather's papers. There he meets Igor (pronounced EYE-gor) (Feldman), who has a hump that moves from side to side - not that he admits to having one (what hump?), the housekeeper Frau Blucher - every time her name is mentioned, horses can be heard neighing in the distance, and a busty lab assistant named Inga (Garr). As if genetically encrypted, he repeats grandpa's experiments and creates a monster (Peter Boyle). What follows is a take-off on the Frankenstein films as the monster escapes and meets a little girl and a blind man (the uncredited Gene Hackman in a Bride of Frankenstein moment), the scenes all the funnier if you've seen the originals. Frankenstein is recaptured, and in order to prove his genius, Dr. F introduces him to a crowd of scientists, and man and his creation perform Puttin' on the Ritz, the highlight of the film.The movie is complete insanity, which is its intent, with great characterizations, funny bits and humor ranging from side-splitting to silly to sexual. The performances are fantastic Wilder plays it straight and dramatic, making his Dr. F even funnier than if he'd camped it up; Feldman also takes his part seriously and gives some deadpan line deliveries; Garr sports a German accent and is very funny as Inga; Leachman's Frau Blucher, who breaks down and admits the earlier Dr. F vas my BOYFWEND gives a truly classic performance in one of the best roles in the film. Peter Boyle's Frankenstein, when he finally speaks, has shades of Marlon Brando - Boyle is positively brilliant, first as a horny giant, then as a singer/dancer, and finally as a misunderstood misfit.The best performance, in my opinion, comes from Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth. It's a bravura performance with her every moment a comic gem, giving the role the magic touch that only she could. Feldman, Boyle, and Kahn are gone now, far too soon, but they all left wonderful comic legacies. Elizabeth is probably Kahn's best film performance. Who can ever hear Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life! in the same way again.

Mel Brooks & Gene Wilder are at their best with excellent support from Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Kenneth Mars, and so many other character roles that are just as memorable and seemingly innumerable.Even without seeing the original Frankenstein and the Son of Frankenstein starring Boris Karloff, this movie seems to gain in its timeless quality as the years go by from its release. Of course, Young Frankenstein does get much funnier when you see the previous Frankenstein movies including Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. If you have seen any Mel Brooks movies, he loves to appear in them. As he has made more and more movies, he cast himself in larger roles and then starred in them. (My favorite is High Anxiety.) I'm impressed with Mr. Brooks that he realized his appearance in this movie would not add to it. Still, his comic expertise and timing are showcased here better than any other Mel Brook film. His collaboration with Gene Wilder's original idea shows each man applying their comedic arts at their peak.Gene Wilder plays our hero, Froedrich Frankenstein. At the beginning of the movie, there several subtle hints that he's not a good guy. The best, quiet example is Give him an extra dollar for the supposed medical volunteer. Then, Froedrich begins his transformation, from pseudo-con-man wanting to cash in his inheritance to mad scientist to sacrificing himself for a greater good. This is a classic comedy with the happy ending in a Shakespearean tradition.Of course, what makes these comedians, Brooks and Wilder, shine is the supporting cast. Without Garr, Feldman, and Leachman, Froedrich's metamorphosis would not occur or make sense. Teri Garr's Inga's accent makes so many of her lines as very funny punchlines. Oof. Marty Feldman's I-gor is so adorable and plays to the audience emphasizing the parody aspect. With every scene he appears, you expect and receive a joke. After watching Cloris Leachman in the movie, you just want to go around saying, Frau Bl√ºcher hoping to hear the reaction.The film does contain three additional jewels Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman. Kahn, as fianc√©e Elizabeth, is absolutely hilarious as a sex-pot of a woman who uses sexuality to get what she wants and who becomes the best bride of Frankenstein ever. Mars' Inspector Kemp is the kooky character that is so strange everything he does has a comedic effect. Finally, Gene Hackman, as the blind hermit Harold, is just precious with his monologue played off the Monster (Peter Boyle).I have mentioned just a few highlights of a great comedy that plays upon our society's collective knowledge and fear of a Frankenstein monster. Please watch Young Frankenstein. Enjoy, Laugh, and Smile.

Curiously, I was to discover, despite the original's enduring stature, this 1974 spoof/homage by Mel Brooks is quite often considered a superior effort. Something of a hit-or-miss comedy director, Brooks discovered a stroke of brilliance in 1974, also releasing his popular western spoof comedy 'Blazing Saddles,' which I must really get around to seeing one of these days. Shot in black and white, 'Young Frankenstein' brilliantly and respectfully captures the essence of the 1931 film, complemented by hilarious performances from Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman and Kenneth Mars.Decades after his grandfather succeeded in his experiment to reanimate dead flesh, publicly-skeptical Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Wilder) &#150; pronounced, we are told, Fr&#156;derick Fronkenshteen &#150; travels to Transylvania to take over the infamous castle and laboratory. Here, aided by his hunch-backed assistant Igor (Feldman) &#150; pronounced Eye-gor &#150; Frankenstein rediscovers his grandfather's work, and so commits himself to reanimating a dead body of his own. Eventually, he succeeds in his experiment, and a hideous, bad-tempered and child-like Creature (Boyle) is risen from the dead.Peter Boyle &#150; best known to television audiences as the rude, obnoxious and infectiously hilarious Frank Barone from 'Everybody Loves Raymond' &#150; is brilliant in the role of the Monster, his comedic timing perfect, despite being restricted to random growls and grunts until the movie's final scenes. It struck me quite hard when Boyle passed away in December of 2006; we'd really lost a genuine comedic talent, and his performance here is yet more proof. Gene Wilder is very good in the title role, playing his character really quite seriously, and so getting a lot of the laughs. Marty Feldman is highly-memorable as the withered and slimy assistant Igor, whether it be for the awkwardly-shifting hump on his back, or the hilariously absurd dialogue (My grandfather used to work for your grandfather. Of course the rates have gone up). Particularly funny is the scene where Igor mistakenly steals the wrong brain to be reanimated, this particular one belonging to a certain person with the curious name of Abbie Normal!In order to fully capture the mood of Whale's 1931 classic horror, Brooks borrowed the same props and lab equipment from the original film. However, occasionally the film departs from that classic feel, most notably in the totally unexpected and sidesplittingly-funny musical rendition of 'Puttin' on the Ritz,' featuring Wilder and Boyle. That was undoubtedly my very favourite moment in the film. Another great scene features Gene Hackman in a cameo appearance as a lonely blind-man who makes the mistake of offering a rampaging Frankenstein some hot soup, some ale and a cigar.

Roth, Michael Fox, John Carradine, Ian Abercrombie, Berry Kroeger, Jeff Maxwell, Clement Von Franckenstein.....Director Mel Brooks, Screenplay Gene Wilder, Mel Brooks.From 1974, this is one of the earliest successes for comedian Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder, who teamed up for this hilarious and well-written comic parody/spoof of the beloved horror classic Frankenstein. It's specifically parodying the 1931 Universal Picture starring Boris Karloff. Gene Wilder stars as Dr. Frederic Frankenstein, a mad scientist living in a castle in Germany, engaged to the beautiful but shallow Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), carrying on an affair with his sexy assistant Inga (Teri Garr)and waited on hand and foot by his hunch-back man-servant Igor (Marty Feldman). Shot in black-and-white and looking every bit as atmospheric and eerie as the original horror classic, this is possibly the best comic spoof of any film. Rather than being over-the-top, silly, grotesque or irreverent, much like today's spoof-comedies, it pays homage to Frankenstein and keeps the spirit of the classic alive, everything from the original music by John Morris, which is dramatic and lively, to the cinematography by Gerald Hirschfield and the impressive production design and costumes by Dorothy Jeakins, which pay tribute to 1930's horror films. When Dr. Frankenstein puts together a cadaver and brings it to life in his laboratory, little does he know how things will really turn out. Actor Peter Boyle, in Frankenstein get-up, plays the monster. Far from intimidating, Dr. Frankenstein trains him like a kind of kid genius and shows him off to the public in a hilarious dance bit- Putting On The Ritz. Frankenstein in the original horror film and novel is a kind of chaotic attempt to re-create a human being, complete with feelings of hate and love. Here, the comedy takes this a step further and provides him with a powerful male libido. This is hilariously showcased in the famous sex scene with Madeline Kahn's Elizabeth, who becomes drawn to the creature, mates with it and climaxes while singing O, sweet Mystery of Life, at last I've found you. Madeline Kahan would become a regular comedienne in the films of Mel Brooks after this film. Gene Wilder hams it up as the mad scientist, and is comfortable in a comic film, settling into the groove he'd entertain audiences with throughout the 1970's, some films being his own project, others comic collaborations with Mel Brooks. But Mel Brooks is the creative force behind this film, which soon enjoyed the status of a classic comedy. Mel even provided the voice for Frankenstein. Sit back and enjoy this comic jewel from the 1970's which saw many fine comedies, such as those by Woody Allen. Well-written, great-looking after all this years, Young Frankenstein remains a beloved comedy.

But YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is in Mel Brooks' best films, possibly because for all it's puns, jokes, spoofs, and fun it actually takes a moment to invert the actual novella by Mary Shelley and show what could have been the answer.Reading FRANKENSTEIN and seeing it's various incarnations on the movie screen and on television are two different things. Except for occasional documentaries on the history channel near Halloween, most people don't know the origins of the story - just perhaps some vague thoughts regarding the story of the Golem, perhaps, or of some of the odd early electricity experiments conducted by Alexander Volta and his contemporaries on dead frog's leg muscles or on executed criminals. You would also be surprised, in reading the story, to find that most versions on the screens delete a whole portion dealing with Captain Robert Walton's attempt to reach the North Pole by ship (a comparative nightmare that is nearly as deadly to Walton's crew as Victor Frankenstein's experiment is to his family and friends). Yet the tale is so powerful it almost always keeps it's audience attention.Here Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder update the story to 20th Century America, where Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (or Frankensteen, as he insists it is pronounced) is trying to live down his cracked grandfather's experiments. He's a successful brain surgeon and expert, and he reluctantly returns to Transylvania and the family castle to collect an inheritance. In the end he gives into the family tradition - as he says during a nightmare he can't escape his destiny. With Marty Feldman as his hunchback assistant (disgusted by Wilder's change of name pronunciation, he calls Wilder Froderick and himself Whygor), and Teri Garr as Inger the lab assistant, and Cloris Leachman as Blucher (note off stage horse whinny) as the enthusiastic house keeper, he creates Peter Boyle, only to turn from his creation when he learns it has gotten an abnormal brain by accident.But there is a major change in the story. In the novel Victor gradually realizes that his creation is hideous, and tries to destroy it - only to find it has hate for him in it's heart and destroys anything Victor loves (including his wife on their wedding night, and his best friend). The monster eventually pursues it's creator to his death, and then reveals to Captain Walton that it realizes that Victor was also the father it should have loved - and will destroy itself on a funeral pyre at the end. There is a hopelessness in the novel for the monster's predicament. Nobody is willing to accept the Monster - it's so ugly and frightening.But in the film, Wilder and Brooks offered an alternative in the modern world. While not losing sight of the ridiculous opportunities for the comedy (culminating in Wilder and Boyle dancing and singing Putting on the Ritz) the screenplay writers also point out that had Victor been kinder to his son and treated him with love and understanding (as Wilder demonstrates to Boyle), then the frightful destructiveness and evil of the monster would never have occurred. It is when Frederick treats the monster nicely that Boyle's monster grows into a more stable character, reaching out to Wilder's sudden interest to bring it acceptance from the locals. And in the end the monster finally gets the social acceptance he failed to find in the novella.I don't wish the reader to think YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is an ultra serious film. Boyle's dancing and singing Putting on the RItz is worth watching the film for, as is Gene Hackman's cameo (based on the blind hermit played by O. P. Heggie in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN) - only this blind hermit can't do anything for the monster but accidentally scald or burn it, driving it out of the hermit's home in a panic. Bits like Kenneth Mars' police chief, cheating in a game of darts with Wilder (and Wilder manages to injure a cat and hit Mars limousine and chauffeur's hat) or Madeleine Kahn's refusal to allow her lover to kiss or touch her (she is perfectly prepared for a society party she was invited too - in the end she and Wilder say their farewells by shaking their elbows!) are wonderful pieces of nonsense. It does succeed in achieving the amusement of the audience who watches it - what more can one do than achieve the main goal of any Hollywood film, particularly a comedy. It merits eight out of ten.

Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you","Date":"6 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" It is difficult to determine which is funnier Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles. Both sprang perhaps full blown from the demented brain of Mel Brooks. The two also represent the apex of his creative genius. He had already done such gems as Your Show of Shows and The Producers, not to mention Get Smart and The 2000 Year Old Man. Following these two masterpieces, Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles, his humor began to dry up and become even trite. Perhaps fame and fortune was too much for him. He still had a little of the spark left for Silent Movie and Spaceballs. Then oblivion. Too bad. We miss the old mad Mel.Young Frankenstein is basically a clever spoof of the old Universal horror flicks of the 30's and 40's, in particular The Bride of Frankenstein, which itself was somewhat of a spoof on the entire genre. Mel had the good sense to shoot it in crisp black and white using sets that resemble the sets in the originals, making the film seem all that more quaint and relevant. He also assembled his cast of idiots, the funniest buffoons on the planet earth at the time, or is it Mars? Who can forget Madeline Kahn's first sexual encounter with the monster? Kahn, who has to be one of the greatest comediennes in screen history, calls Frankenstein's monster by her pet name for him, Zipper Neck. Once consummated Kahn lets out one of the wildest soprano screeches ever heard, Ah! Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you. Gene Wilder is the only actor capable of playing Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (that's Frankensteen) with a flippancy so exaggerated that it comes off comical. Igor (that's I-Gor), the deformed dwarf who is in hump denial, is played in a grotesquely burlesque manner that is both repulsive and humorous by that crazy man Marty Feldman. Cloris Leachman is so creepy she would make any horse whinny and who wouldn't want a tumble in the hay with Teri Garr? So much as been written about the marvelous scene with the blind man played by the consummate actor Gene Hackman that one need only say, don't miss it. It is an outrageous parody of a similar scene in The Bride of Frankenstein, where the blind hermit is portrayed by O.P. Heggie. Then there's the monster, given a caricature interpretation by Peter Boyle. While not as ghoulish as Boris Karloff (who is?), he is just right for the comic touches required for the part.If for some unknown reason you haven't seen Young Frankenstein yet, by all means ignore the reviews and rent it on DVD or watch it on TV. You'll laugh till you're sore. This is one of those rare films that can stand repeat viewings and remain fresh and alive.

It is only after he finds an old notebook detailing exactly how to re-awaken the dead that he believes it might be possible. That's when the movie takes off. Each scene becomes more hilarious than the last one.Frankenstein has enough meat on it to make fun of. A mad scientist resurrects the dead with his hunchback assistant? Seriously. The challenge wasn't making the movie funny. The challenge was making it funny while not making it too over-the-top. Although stories that focus only on humor can work, and have on many occasions, the general story of Frankenstein has too much plot for it to fit well here. And that's what Mel Brooks did. He focused on the plot and stemmed the humor from there. It works beautifully.From Fronkensteen to Eye-gor, and everyone in between, Young Frankenstein is one of the funniest movies around.

When he inherits the castle of his infamous grandfather, Victor Frankenstein, he changes plans and decides to make grandpa's dreams come true. Working after Frankenstein Sr.'s notes, Frederick sets out to create life in his laboratory. If only his assistant Igor (hilarious Martin Feldman) hadn't screwed up by stealing an abnormal brain for the monster...Mel Brooks truly is the king of spoofs. With SPACEBALLS, he spoofed the entire STAR WARS trilogy, while still managing to write a coherent plot into the comedy. HIGH ANXIETY faced the hard task of spoofing Hitchcock, one of the most revered directors in film history, and succeeded brilliantly. Even the misfired Dracula DEAD AND LOVING IT had some clever stabs at the vampire genre.YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is not as much of a spoof as it is an homage to the classic '33 horror film. Shot in black and white, with amazing cinematography and gorgeous set design that perfectly captures the spirit of FRANKENSTEIN, the film is great to look at as well as hilarious.Gene Wilder is solid as Frankenstein, but it's Martin Feldman who steals the show as the hunchbacked assistant, Igor. His wild facial expressions and memorable lines (what hunch?) make him one of the funniest characters you're ever likely to see on film. The most classic gag in the film might be Igor's walk this way pun at the train station. Kenneth Mars is also a treat as the armed and dangerous police inspector Friederich Kemp.Overall Mel Brook's movie is solid, beautiful to look at, consistently funny and definitely worth a look. 8 out of 10.

Mel Brooks is getting ready to bring Young Frankenstein to Broadway as a musical, he may strike gold with it and probably do a film of the musical, but it can never be as good as this gem. The DVD is great to own and has lots of extras and some facts about the making of the film. One for instance is that Teri Garr got the part of Inga, because Madeline Kahn was offered the part first but felt the smaller part of Elizabeth was better for her. It was a far smaller role, but she put her stamp on it and stole every scene she was in. She should have been nominated for another Oscar for this role and could have one it too. That is the only one thing about the film that does bother me, that she is in only a few scenes, but when she is on screen its pure magic.

Mel Brooks directed this masterpiece based on the older looks of the movies before when it was made (1974) and kept the comedy subtle at times and in-your-face at others. Frederick Frankstein, played by Gene Wilder, has decided to prove his father's experiments to reanimate a human after death as a hoax. When he gets to the castle where the experimenting took place, his view on the project changes and Frankstein continues the research and overall successes and failures that came with the creation.So automatically, you think OK, just like Mary Shelley's vision of the doctor and his monster. But that's where Brooks and Wilder come in and help with comedic possibilities in the castle. From the bumbling Igor (pronounced eye-gore), played by the bug-eyed Marty Feldman, to Teri Garr's character as Inga, the assistant to Dr. Frankenstein, everybody around Wilder's Frankenstein enacted upon him to keep going with his experimenting and resolutions. The characters were all memorable and hilarious, and, in contrast to most character films, the actors knew when to dumb down their characters and when to have them go crazy and hilarious.I thought that time kinda works against this film a little. The comedic movies that are released now don't work as hard as this crew did on this film, granted, but the jokes and pun-humor that is included in this movie is a little dated and old-timed. Its a definitive Brooks film, however, and that needs some recognition because Mel has been making great films for many years, all with great premises and gags. The music was eerie and tried for the feel of the 30's Frankenstein but mixed well with the showboating scene when the monster dances with its creator onstage in front of the town-audience. The sets were straight out of the original Frankstein (many of the original props and settings were used for the film, BTW) and the set designer was a genius with his vision, as well.I gave this film a 7/10 because it still feels a bit dated and hard to watch a little bit, but the comedy added that comfort to keep you watching.

Bliss!","Date":"3 June 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  SPOILERSWhen Mel Brooks was preparing to release the wonderful Blazing Saddles, he was set up working with his friend Gene Wilder on another piece of cinema. Wilder, for the last few months had been writing his latest idea, a satire of the classic Frankenstein films, and inviting Brooks to work with him, Wilder was to bring together an amazing group of people who would make Young Frankenstein the masterpiece that it is.In this film, Wilder plays young Frederick Frankenstein, a lecturer in neuroscience, who is given the last will and testament of his great grandfather. Travelling to Transylvania, Frederick finds himself with his own servant Igor (played beautifully by Marty Feldman) and it isn't long before he's creating his own monster too.Just like in Blazing Saddles and The Producers, it is not just Mel Brooks, but his cast which makes the film so damn good. By including Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn in this film, Wilder and Brooks have chosen two of my alltime favourite actors. Marty Feldman was a comic genius who is so often undervalued and who's early death was a tragedy for comedy. Likewise, Madeline's death in 1999 of Ovarian Cancer was also a comedic tragedy. All three of the main women in this film are wonderful in fact. Alongside Kahn, Teri Garr as Inga is hilarious and brilliant, even if often nowadays it is too easy for people to see her as Phoebe's mother from Friends. Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher is the third main female star of this film, and whilst missing the sexual element which Kahn and Garr added, Leachman casts a twisted feature as her character, the original Dr Frankenstein's secret Girlfriend.Just like in the classic Boris Karloff films, it is the monster who is the most important character, and teaming up with Kahn, Wilder and company, as the monster was Peter Boyle. Boyle spending the majority of the film groaning is superb, adding a sense of child like naivety to the monster's existence.Aside from the beautiful combination of actors, with Mel Brooks behind the director, Young Frankenstein is a beautiful success. With the rare style of filming it in Black and White (the first time a film had been made in monotone for eight or nine years), the magic was complete.Ultimately, it can be very hard for me to write a review for Mel Brooks films. The reasoning behind this is that whilst I can easily condemn the later features, with the earlier films, I adore them all so much that it can be incredibly difficult to compare them with each other. With Young Frankenstein though I adore it so much that I have nothing but praise for it. If I had to choose one Mel Brooks film for a Brooks virgin, I'd choose Blazing Saddles. In contrast if I wanted to choose the most clever and ingenius of his films, I confess I'd choose The Producers. For my own personal choice though and for my pure love of so many of the cast characters, I would choose Young Frankenstein every day. This film is a piece of cinema history and something to be remembered.

To start with, it was made fast on the heels of one of the all-time comedy classics, Blazing Saddles, which director Mel Brooks was still editing while he simultaneously shot Young Frankenstein. The films opened months apart in 1974, and Young Frankenstein, while a very different and less wild comedy than Blazing Saddles, hardly suffered from the juxtaposition. They are still considered by most people Mel Brooks' #1 and #2 comedies, perhaps the #1 and #2 comedies of the 1970s. The only question may be which is which.I just feel blessed to be in a world with both. Blazing Saddles is funnier, it broke conventions and made anarchy into an art form. It's a greater comedy than Young Frankenstein, and a more significant work of art. But Young Frankenstein is the better film. It has a heart. You are encouraged not just to laugh, but to feel, feel for the pathetic, confused monster; for his vainglorious creator; for the sad crone who pines for her long-dead love and winces with real hurt when the horses whinny at the sound of her name. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. And it's so funny, it's deadly.Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks clearly needed each other more than either cared to admit. As other posters note, they never collaborated after this film, and neither had much good to show for their separation (Wilder did have another collaboration or two left with Richard Pryor, so he did a little better, but choosing between Life Stinks and Funny About Love is a dog's breakfast to be sure.) Look how mightily Wilder roars. In his DVD commentary, Brooks calls Wilder's performance more than brilliant, it's Promethean. Wilder's Dr. Fronk-En-Steen is en fuego indeed, screaming with more passion than Wilder bestowed on all his subsequent roles combined. His wild hair, his lustful ravishings of Madeline Kahn and Teri Garr, his jabbing a scalpel in his thigh, is the stuff of inspired genius, and shows a comic actor at the top of his game. Brooks, by contrast, plays it relatively straight, letting the script go for the laughs while he concentrates on setting up the actors and establishing the film's brilliant mood, which plays off the original Universal Frankenstein films in a clearly respectful but nevertheless playfully satirical way. As caustic and scatological as he was in Blazing Saddles, Brooks is sweet and disciplined here. The vulgarity is minimal, the sex jokes are less obvious, and there's a real story to follow.The ensemble cast also helps. They play off each other like a polished orchestra, to the point where you can't really pick a favorite character. At least for me, it changes. Marty Feldman is the audience manqu√© as the charmingly weird EYE-gor, Cloris Leachman (the only member of the cast to ever win an Oscar, but for The Last Picture Show) is goofy and sinister at the same time as Frau Blucher He vas my BOYFRIEND! Actresses have never come as simultaneously sexy and hilarious as Teri Garr, who has fun with her accent and her eyes. Peter Boyle projects youthful innocence and fear as the Monster, cashing it all in comedically in his Putting On The Ritz performance.Young Frankenstein was nearly the first movie I ever saw, early in 1975 when I was all of eight, and watching it again takes me back to that first feeling of wonder. You get this great classic horror build-up, enough to stir dread in the youngest hearts, and then you get bowled over with humor for ninety minutes. But the film never quite lets go of the scary stuff, which is why it endures. Indeed, the best scenes, like the one where the good Doctor has himself locked in a room with a monster, ordering his staff not to let him out, have a healthy dose of both. (`What's the matter with you people, couldn't you tell I was joking! Let me out! Mommy!')The DVD for this is especially worth having, with Brooks' commentary, a documentary with Wilder but not Brooks (are they never going to collaborate on anything ever again?), and nice little bonus features, like commercials with Brooks' clever voice-overs (Some say this is the best movie ever made, and this is Some signing off) and a pair of Spanish-language interviews shot for Mexican television which demonstrate both YF's international appeal and the good-natured, try-anything attitude of the cast as Wilder, Leachman, and Feldman obviously relish being interviewed in two languages at once. (Leachman even kisses the interviewer on the lips at the end of her segment; where can I get a job like his?) Young Frankenstein may be a film set entirely at night, but the sun was really shining on these guys all the same.

The film is on part comedy classic and one part admirable film in an aesthetic sense.  The crisp black and white cinematography is really quite gorgeous.Co-written by Brooks and the film's star Gene Wilder, Young Frankenstein is (in this viewer's humble opinion) Brooks' greatest film to date.  Not only does it have some of the funniest lines of any film I've seen, (`What hump?') but showcases some of the most brilliant comedic acting seen in decades.  Gene Wilder, who has woefully all but disappeared from cinema the last two decades, is at his peak in this film.  His `Dr. Frankenstein' is at times both serious and completely spastic.  Teri Garr's `Inga' the lab assistant, is hilarious as a German sexpot.  Cloris Leachman's role as `Frau Blucher', the caretaker of Frankenstein's castle whose very name inspires the `whinnying' of horses is small, but incredibly memorable.  And Marty Feldman practically steals the show as `Igor', Dr. Frankenstein's henchman who has a wandering hump and a funny way of walking.  These characters are just a few examples of the outstanding cast who execute the brilliant lines in such a manner that thirty years later we are still repeating them and acting out various scenes.  There truly are not enough good things to say about Young Frankenstein, and certainly nothing that hasn't already been said.  If you have not seen this film, it is one of those films that one should see in their lifetime &#150; not because it is an `important' or `socially relevant' film, but simply because it is a GREAT film.  --Shelly  "},{"Title":"The only film to survive Mel Brooks","Date":"10 November 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  First off, I am not Mel Brooks fan. In fact he is among my least favourite writers of all time. Which is why, when I caught a late-night showing of 'Young Frankenstein' on TV, I was so surprised at just how good it was. The art direction is brilliant, especially as it uses -and captures the feel of- the original Frankenstein sets. I have read most of the other user comments for this film and am alarmed at how different my opinion is whilst agreeing overall on the film's genius.Most of the reviews I have read lauded praise almighty upon Marty Feldman (as Igor) above the considerable talent of Gene Wilder (Frankenstein). Marty Feldman is NOT good in this movie and barely anything he says or does is funny (I mostly blame the writing as he does have the worst selection of jokes). I can't help wonder if people are just laughing at his eyes.More worrying is the choice of jokes that have been recounted (What big knockers, Frau Blucher etc..). Did no-one else recognise that the funniest bit was when Dr. Frankenstein gets so mad with a student that he stabs himself in the leg with a scalpel. On paper it doesn't sound so funny but Gene Wilder's reaction makes it hilarious. And this is why I think the film works; whilst sitting through the film I found it painfully obvious which jokes were written by Mel Brooks and which were Wilder's.The best example of Mel Brooks seemingly intentional avoidance of humour is that the fact that he wanted to get rid of the tap-dancing monster scene. This is one of the highlights of the film and one of the best comic scenes of all time. A quick mention of Peter Boyle is order, he quite simply is the monster. A superlative performance.Overall, this is a brilliant film and as much as I criticise the dodgy Mel Brooks humour, it didn't spoil the film.

All of these actors are so perfect that I can't imagine anyone else in their parts. The touches made to make this movie look like one of the old Universal Frankenstein films(Peter Boyle's makeup, comic variations on classic scenes, and the brilliant choice to make the movie black and white) push this movie toward greatness.

While Brooks's comedic style is somewhat of an acquired taste, and either hits or misses almost instantly, Young Frankenstein was not only a more intellectual endeavor than his wildly successful Blazing Saddles, but like Blazing Saddles, has stood up under (almost) thirty years of scrutiny. Watching Young Frankenstein today, it is just as funny, and just as clever, as it was when it was first done.Gene Wilder brilliantly portrays the grandson of Baron Victor Von Frankenstein; an unwilling heir to his genius, his castle, and all the knowledge the infamous doctor had in his possession. Terri Garr is perfectly cast as the finger-in-the-mouth, knee-bent into the other knee, dumb blond, easy-to-seduce lab assistant to the young Dr.Frankenstein. And Marty Feldman had never been better cast in a role in his entire career, as Igor, Frankenstein's right hand...man.Complete with a cameo by Gene Hackman, and Peter Boyles as the Monster. The running gags throughout the movie are a bit weak, admittedly, but the overall genius of the film leaves no doubt that Mel Brooks captured something almost magickal in his direction of this wonderful homage.No wonder that the use of the English language was so well prescribed in this marvelous production. It was co-written by Gene Wilder himself, as a comedic adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel.As a classic in the comedy field, this fine Mel Brooks production has withstood the tests of time and stands with a brilliant line of classic parodies directed by Brooks.If you liked this movie, please give Spaceballs a try. It is another brilliant parody, this time of the Star Wars series by George Lucas.I also highly recommend The History of the World, Part 1, also by Brooks. It is an irreverent look at our biblical past. Life Stinks, another parody, this time of the legendary comedic effort by Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy entitled, Trading Places. And last but certainly not least, Blazing Saddles, a brilliant, well received parody of the western films of America's recent past.It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend .

They both hit back to back home runs with Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles that year. Young Frankenstein as you would expect is a spoof on the classic Universal Pictures horror flicks of the 30's and early 40s. Wilder developed the original concept and Brooks was brought in later to direct and ended up co-writing the final script. Frederick von Frankenstein...pronounced FrankenstEEn(Wilder) the grandson of the evil Victor von Frankenstein returns to his ancestral home upon the death of his father. There he meets the hunch backed dwarf Igor...pronounce EYEgor (Marty Feldman), his voluptuous lab assistant Inga (Terri Garr) and at the castle, the sinister Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman). After hearing a mysterious violin, Frederick stumbles upon the laboratory of his ancestor. He then decides to create his own being which turns out to be Peter Boyle. The monster of course escapes and lampoons all of the cliches from the old movies including encounters with a little girl and a blind hermit. Later Frederick's fiance, Elizabeth (Madeliene Kahn) arrives and well..we have a foursome. Investigating all of the surrounding mayhem is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars) in a hilarious send up of the Lionel Atwill character from Son of Frankenstein (1939). The film was shot in black and white to give it that classic look. All of the horror cliches are there. We have the dark shadows, creaking doors and the classic original set pieces, the secret passage behind the revolving bookcase, the whinny of the horses at the mention of the name Frau Brucher, the graveyard sequence, the town people's riot etc. The film is perfectly cast. Wilder is hilarious in the lead role. Garr in her first major part, is sexy and innocent as Inga, Madeleine Kahn is fantastic as The Bride of Frankenstein, Marty Feldman (with the bulgy rolling eyes) is unforgettable as Igor, Peter Boyle is equally funny as the monster (his musical number with Wilder is a hoot) and Kenneth Mars is great as Inspector Kemp with the artificial arm. Watch how Igor's hump and Kemp's arm change from one side to the other. If you haven't seen the film, you'll have fun identifying the famous actor doing a cameo as the blind hermit Harold. This one is not to be missed. It's probably no coincidence that both Brooks and Wilder's greatest cinematic successes were in Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. It's a pity that they didn't collaborate on other projects.

However, it is clear that they are very different films; Blazing Saddles is in-your-face, childlike slapstick, while Young Frankenstein is more reserved, thoughtful and subtle.  Both have managed to retain enormous appeal over the last 30 years, and for this reason alone Mr Brooks should be commended.  On a personal level, I prefer Young Frankenstein.

And what of his descendants?  How would his legacy of horror have affected them a few generations down the line?  Well, ponder no more, because these questions and many more are finally answered forevermore in `Young Frankenstein,' an hilarious parody directed by Mel Brooks.  Dr. Frankenstein's great-grandson, Frederick (Gene Wilder), is a doctor and teacher whose research has gained him some renown in his own right, and he has done his best to disassociate himself with the tarnished reputation of his ancestor (he even pronounces his name `Fronk-en-Steen').  Then one day he is notified that he has inherited his great-grandfather's estate, including the castle, in which the elder doctor's laboratory has been preserved.  Frederick, of course, must go to Transylvania to settle his affairs; but the whole affair soon becomes unsettled when Frederick discovers that it is impossible to escape his destiny.  And once he arrives, the die is cast and there is just no turning back, as he can no longer deny that his... name... is... FRANKENSTEIN!	On his own, Mel Brooks is usually good, even great, but when he teams up with Gene Wilder it becomes something extra-special, which first became apparent with `The Producers,' in 1967.  But the directness with which Brooks approaches this material, combined with Wilder's understated performance makes this their all-time best.  They co-wrote the screenplay, and with their differing perspectives of comedy they managed to capture the best of both worlds and strike a balance that works to perfection here.  Brooks hits you over the head and gets right in your face with a gag, but Wilder steps aside, grabs it by the tail and hits the pause button (so-to-speak), just long enough to really put the joke across.  Together they're like the ying and yang of the comedic universe.  The screenplay is clever and includes all of the elements that successfully evoke the essence of the old B&W horror films that are such a part of cinematic lore today.  What they give you with this film is the Frankenstein story with contemporary sensibilities, while presenting a cast of characters that take it over the top.	As far as the performances go, nobody, but nobody could have played Frederick better than Gene Wilder.  He employs that prolonged, meaningful pause of his (nobody does it better), which he usually accentuates with a slight shifting of the eyes-- just before he delivers a line-- that can make even a mediocre line hilarious.  His subtle approach and staid countenance play this material perfectly, and complimented by Brooks' straight ahead direction it allows the humor to flow naturally and freely and never fails to get the right kind of laugh at just the right time.  The way they capture the sense of the original `Frankenstein' (and the many sequels) is uncanny, from the overall look of the film to the reactions by everyone at the mere mention of the monster, to the throng of anxious villagers led by the unfaltering and inarticulate Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars).	Besides Wilder, who is clearly the star of the show, the supporting performances turned in by this superlative ensemble cast are absolutely impeccable, beginning with Peter Boyle as the monster.  Boyle has the gait and the growl down pat, but also conveys so much with his expressions and introspective comportment.  Then there is Marty Feldman as Igor (that's `EYE-gore'), whose bug-eyed portrayal of the little hunchback who refuses to acknowledge his hump (mainly because he doesn't realize he actually has one) is hilarious.  Teri Garr is a joy to behold as Inga, Frederick's lab assistant, and Cloris Leachman practically steals the show as Frau Blucher (and don't say her name within earshot of the horses).  Mars also creates a memorable character by putting a mumble and a wooden arm to especially riotous use, and last but not least is the wonderful Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth, Frederick's intended who ultimately finds something grand to sing about.  	Also included in the supporting cast are Richard Haydn (Herr Falkstein), Liam Dunn (Mr. Hilltop), Danny Goldman (in a memorable bit as a medical student who challenges Frederick during a lab demonstration), Anne Beesley (Little Girl), Michael Fox (Villager) and Gene Hackman in an uproarious cameo as Harold, the Blind Man.  Often a parody of this nature wears thin after awhile, and even the best rarely manages to maintain a level of excellence for even thirty or forty minutes, let alone for 105 minutes as this one does.  And without question, `Young Frankenstein' delivers on a level to which few films of this nature can even aspire.  Arguably one of Mel Brooks' best-- if not THE best he's ever done-- and with a definitive performance by Gene Wilder, this parody takes a place among the all time greats in the history of the cinema.  It's funny stuff that gets funnier every time you see it, and that's the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.

I enjoyed the bit about the secret door with Gene Wilder and Teri Garr, the little girl flying off the see-saw and the blind-man sketch with Gene Hackman (who I didn't notice until I saw his name in the end credits).  But I really, really expected to laugh more.

I really wish Brooks could've made his character funnier, so he could've had more to work with.  He's turned in fine comic performances (watch his performance as a Bible-toting schitzophrenic in The Dream Team) and I'm sure he could've done something great with the role.Some people dispute Brooks' more recent works like Robin Hood  Men in Tights and Spaceballs, when in fact I think those are some of his best films.

He tackled all manner of genres but Young Frankenstein is possibly his best. In this one the target was 1930's Universal horror movies, or more specifically the 'Frankenstein' films. What makes this one work so well is that, aside from Brooks' typical crazed humour; there is a real attempt to capture the look and feel of those old movies it is satirizing. The sumptuous black and white photography and the elaborate sets all recall the Universal 'Frankenstein' outings. And overall there is an unmistakable loving care at work. Brooks is definitely respectful of the films he is parodying and this ensures that they have not only the laughs but a fine attention to detail. Quite a few of the funniest moments require audience familiarity with the source movies, so Young Frankenstein is not simply pandering to easy laughs but working in specific references as well.The other thing that really helps massively is the cast. Gene Wilder is undoubtedly the star of the show as the title character. This film really shows why he remains one of the funniest cinema actors of all time. Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster is a good rival to Boris Karloff's original but with great comic timing &#x96; his performance of 'Puttin' on the Ritz' is inspired hilarity. While Gene Hackman is hilarious as the blind hermit, his scene with Boyle is comic gold from start to finish and is one of the undoubted highlights of the movie. To be fair, like all Brooks movies, this is still somewhat uneven in bits. Some of the humour doesn't really work so well. Marty Feldman, for example, looks really funny but his comic delivery is pretty poor. But in the main, the jokes still work more than they do not. On the whole it's a great looking, funny film.

But, it is consistently funny with some clever slapstick and wordplay. Some of it is quite refreshingly inventive (Abbey Normal) and Cloris Leachman's deadpan mugging.The Hunchback (what hunch?) Igor (pronounced eye-gore) also is a field day for Marty Feldman. Add to this the spot on mimicry of the one armed Captain from the Son of' Movie, and the inspired Peter Boyle's Creature, it all sums up for a great looking love-fest from Brooks and company. The one drawback is the relentless screaming of lines, when they would have been even more effective delivered a bit more restrained.

It is certainly a lovely movie, with great performances &#x96; mainly those of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman &#x96; and an interesting, modern remake of the original Mary Shelley novel. I particularly liked the fact that it's black and white &#x96; this helps greatly in creating the creepy and old-movie-like atmosphere. It's also quite funny, but I suggest you don't see it more than once because it might disappoint you after more viewings.The respectable doctor Frederik Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) has tried for many years to cut the ties with his family, as his grandfather, the baron, had become famous for trying to reanimate dead bodies and in his opinion, his grandfather's work was crap. But after he arrives to the Transylvanian castle that belonged to his late grandfather, Frederik discovers his diary and decides to try and reanimate someone dead himself, as it appears his grandfather had succeeded. In this task, he is aided by Igor (Marty Feldman) and Inga (Teri Garr).As I said, the atmosphere in this movie is great it's all black and white, and it features mostly night scenes in the creepy Transylvanian environment, with howling wolves and fog all around. This characteristic is also very well used in some jokes. Marty Feldman is amazing as Igor, and the character himself is so funny and strange, it's delightful to watch him. Gene Wilder does an incredible job in portraying Dr. Frankenstein, especially in his madness. Peter Boyle, even though he doesn't speak most of the time since he's the monster, is very good nonetheless.This movie is also a nice homage to the old Universal movies. Unfortunately, Young Frankenstein fails as a comedy. Not horribly, but still. Some of the jokes are repetitive and not very funny, although there are some truly amusing scenes. Also, some parts are slow and boring. But considering how horrible modern spoofs are, this movie really shouldn't be bashed. I would definitely recommend watching it, especially since the first time you might just find it hilarious.Read more at http//passpopcorn.wordpress.com/ "},{"Title":"the old man revealed","Date":"8 February 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is a classic.

After watching Young Frankenstein, I discovered that it was only nominated for 2 Oscars Best Sound and Best Original Screenplay (co-written with Mel Brooks from Gene Wilder's original draft). Had the movie been nominated for other awards, it wouldn't have surprised me the photography is top notch and perfectly renders the feeling of old 30's horror classics, the black and white cinematography perfectly conveys the haunting shadowy atmosphere of the original Frankenstein, the score is perfect for the story, Mel Brooks' directing never seemed so tactful and professional and I can think of any of the main cast deserving a nod for the acting. I guess that the film being released the same year than Chinatown or The Godfather Part II didn't help; Mel Brooks wasn't the only one at the top of his game.But let's get back to Young Frankenstein. Besides being an undeniable technical achievement, the film is an excellent comedy that contains some of the most hilarious lines and moments in cinematic history and certainly the greatest comedic cast ever (thunders' sound effects to emphasize). Indeed, each actor, each actress occupies the screen with a unique magnetism, starting by Gene Wilder, the one with whom it all started. As Wilder said, he wondered how he would act if he was the descendant of the infamous Baron Viktor von Frankenstein, the answer couldn't have been more intelligent and hilarious. The Professor is so ashamed of his affiliation that he wants his name to be pronounced 'Fron-kon-steene', but this attitude reflects an interesting contradiction as he finally realizes he can't escape his destiny and must go to Transylvania to accomplish the same miracle than his glorious ancestor. After a decent start, Mel Brooks 'elevates' the film.The doctor meets a wonderful gallery of colorful characters, the voluptuous assistant Inga, played by Teri Garr, in a knock-out performance, Cloris Leachman as the frightening Frau Bl√ºcher whose any mention of her name never ceases to make the horses rear in fright, and there is Fronkonsteen's fianc√©e, in a role that could have been secondary if it wasn't for Madeline Kahn's extraordinary scene-stealing ability. The film also features Kenneth Mars barely recognizable in his policeman's disguise, and an even less recognizable performance by Gene Hackman as a well-mannered blind man (I can't believe I missed it during the first viewing). But in all cinematic objectivity, the film's greatness relies on two pillar performances, and I'll start with the most memorable one.First, there's Marty Fedlman's role as Igor (pronounced eye-gor) as the hunchback and butler of the Transylvanian mansion. Igor's character inspired what would remain for me the greatest character's introduction in any comedy, with this sudden and unforgettable close-up on his smile and incredibly bulged eyes. To appreciate the comical talent of Feldman requires both a voracious appetite and a gourmet's delicacy. His comical genius can take you totally off- guard when his face shows up from nowhere, or when he ad-libs a scene -I won't say which but it's so hysterical that even Gene Wilder looks like he's totally losing it- OR you just have to pay attention to his mimics, his reactions when a gag is already over, and realize that Igor himself, is a punchline within a punchline. The What hump? moment is pure comedic gold.The other pillar is of course Peter Boyle as the Creature, monster is too cruel a word to even be used on this gentle giant with high-pitched screams and touching hobby of catching imaginary butterflies in the air. Boyle beautifully incarnates the syndrome of the misunderstood monster and the spirit of Mary Shelley's novel. And this epitomizes the merit and the force of Young Frankenstein each actor and actresses doesn't play a character, but reinvent a role with such an intensity that the film stands alone as a classic. Of course, it has all the elements of the Frankenstein series, but you don't need to be a fan to appreciate Mel Brooks' film on its own. It's not just a masterpiece of stylish copy, it's a masterpiece as a story, as an ambiance, as an ensemble cast performance, as a comedy where visual and written comedy works in perfect harmony (the farewell in the train station scene is a perfect demonstration) I often blamed Blazing Saddles for being too broad on the parody-thing, and to let the movie evolve to an extreme where the humor ceased to be enjoyable story-wise and overused the whole meta-referential jokes, almost insisting upon itself until a throw-away climax. Young Frankenstein doesn't evoke itself; it doesn't try to imitate but succeeds in duplicating an atmosphere to provide a whole other reaction from the audience. And the adaptation is so original that it can be regarded as one of the greatest 'Frankenstein' films, any genre combined, and Peter Boyle's performance has nothing to envy on Boris Karloff, it's simply &#x85; magical and it contributes to one of the highlights of the film.Indeed, if you wanted a last proof that Young Frankenstein is an original classic, forever rooted in cinematic memories, just start singing this If you're blue and you don't know where to go to why don't you go where fashion sits&#x85; any movie expert would say Puttin' in the Ritz referring to some Fred Astaire dance routine, but a true movie lover would immediately reply PUDDIN' ON A RHEEEEEEZ in a high-pitched voice. The movie features one of the most hilarious musical duets ever that would make even the most abnormal brain laugh.And if only for that piece of hilarity, Mel Brooks's masterpiece Young Frankenstein deserves to its place as one of the funniest films ever, it's raunchy, outrageous, irreverent, poetic, sensitive, inventive and as would shout the Creature OOPAH DOOPAH "},{"Title":"Mel Brooks is a genius","Date":"21 January 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Mel Brooks is, in my humble opinion, nothing short of a genius when it comes to satire.

Gene Wilder, who also co-wrote the Screen Story and Screenplay with Brooks, is the wild eyed, pseudo conservative scientist who is inexorably drawn into the world of his ancestors with little encouragement. Marty Feldman (God bless you, Marty) is priceless as Igor, the misshapen hunchback with a terrific sense of humor and a passion for the ladies. Teri Garr....hmm...one word...Wooof! Perfectly ditsy and blonde, her character adds the perfect setup lines for the dry and witty humor of Wilder and Feldman. The entire cast is fantastic, and the photography in black and white is a treat for anyone who appreciates the medium. The inclusion of the original Frankenstein laboratory equipment with the permission of Kenneth Strickfaden was a particularly nice touch. Now while there is sexual innuendo in the film, the tone is more Vaudeville than lewd, and I think most families could watch this with the kiddies in the room and not be offended. And if you are not aware, Young Frankenstein The Musical, is currently touring the U. S. and is as entertaining as the original film.

Wilder is Dr. Fronkensteen (he's trying to distance himself from his grandfather's legacy, hence the alternate pronunciation) who returns to the old family castle in Transylvania, not taking a very long time to develop an intense interest in Victor's plans to reanimate dead tissue. Both helped and hindered by ultra sexy assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and hunchbacked associate Igor, pronounced Eye-gor (the hilarious Marty Feldman), he gets to create his own Monster, played by Peter Boyle. With equally amusing work by Madeline Kahn as uptight Elizabeth, Cloris Leachman as conniving Frau Blucher (cue the horse whinny), and Kenneth Mars as sometimes unintelligible Inspector Kemp, who does some superb shtick with his artificial arm, the cast plays their roles to the hilt. Wilder goes delightfully over the top at times, always coming up with just the right delivery of his lines, Boyle is very endearing as The Monster, and Feldman does some priceless mugging. Many memorable set pieces, including the show-stopping Putting on the Ritz musical number, and much in the way of quotable dialogue. The spoof of the interlude with the blind man from Bride of Frankenstein is also fantastic, with an unrecognizable Gene Hackman playing the blind man, as is the sequence with the revolving wall. Hearing Kahn voice her sexual pleasure in song is a hoot, especially considering her choice of song. Utilizing the talents of people like composer John Morris, cinematographer Gerald Hirschfeld, and production designer Dale Hennesy, Brooks impressively recreates the look of those old movies, and for good measure also utilizes the original laboratory equipment designed by Kenneth Strickfaden. Young Frankenstein has to remain one of the high points of Brooks's career (along with Blazing Saddles, he had a real banner year in 1974), and although he returned to poking fun of classic horror with Dracula Dead and Loving It, it just wasn't as effective. 37 years later, Young Frankenstein is still genuinely funny and atmospheric, and enjoyable upon each viewing. 10 out of 10.

It is filled with numerous objects of various shape and size.  Many are desirable, many are not.  Numerous Mel Brooks films, including Robin Hood Men in Tights, Dracula Dead and Loving It and High Anxiety amused me in points, but overall left me craving more of the desirable goodies.  However, when he is in top form, like in Blazing Saddles and both stage and screen incarnations of The Producers, he unleashes a treasure chest of comedy. Never is this more apparent than in his greatest film, Young Frankenstein.The plot lovingly pays homage to Mary Shelley's famous horror story while simultaneously spoofing it.  Gene Wilder plays Dr. Frederick Von Frankenstein (pronounced Frahnk-en-steen, as he duly notes), grandson of the famous scientist responsible for bringing the dead back to life.  When it is discovered that his late grandfather left the estate to him, he travels to Transylvania to inspect it.  Accompanied by Igor, a hunchback in denial (What hump?), curvaceous German assistant Inga, and haggard Frau Blucher (whose very mention of her name inspires the horses to neigh in fright...no matter where they are), Frederick finds himself slowly drawn into his grandfather's practice, much to the dismay of the nearby villagers.The reason this film works so well is because, unlike other Brooks outings, this was very controlled.  Its over-the-top moments are still done with more subletly than previous Brooks jokes (most are caught only through repeat viewings).  The script, by Wilder and Brooks, is filled with with one small comic gem after the other.  Brooks' direction is also at its best, as he crafts the film much like Frankestein director James Whale would have done it.  The black-and-white cinematography shines almost as much as the cast. Wilder, Teri Garr's Inga, and Marty Feldman's Igor dominate the first half of the film, while Peter Boyle as the Monster, Madeline Kahn as Wilder's vain wife, and Kenneth Mars as the inspector with a wooden arm steal the show's later half.  A notable cameo is a nearly unrecognizable Gene Hackman as a blind man.There are so many moments in this film that shine, it is hard to choose a favorite.  The hump joke?  Puttin' On the Ritz?  The blind man? Put...the candle...back?  The brain depository?  There are perhaps more classic moments from this film than any other film since Casablanca. The fact that this film is more loved, more sharply written, and perhaps a better film than the target that it spoofs is truly a small cinematic miracle.

For instance Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best original score and I believe it should have won for Best Director, Actor, and screenplay.Another side note As an aspiring filmmaker I have found a lot of inspiration from this movie.

My personal favorite is Young Frankenstein, as it is not only a send-up of old black-and-white horror films, but also a tribute, with its wonderful photography, authentic scenery, and the actual laboratory equipment from the original Frankenstein movies.  Gene Wilder is without a doubt a national treasure, one of the greatest (if not the greatest) comic actors of all time, and his portrayal of Dr. Fronk-un-steen is masterful. No slam on Mr. Brooks, but this is one of those films that are better for his acting absence; it is evident that this was to be his masterpiece, and he wanted only the best in front of the camera.  Better than High Anxiety by a nose, this film certainly deserves mention on any comedy top-ten list that might come down the pike.

The story of a mad man who was able to bring a dead person back to life has shocked nations and generations and will shock in the future as well.  This is probably one of the reasons why Mel Brooks' movie is so great.  He was able to take a serious story, almost traumatising and make a classic comedy out of it.  His movie is a pure satire from beginning to end and this is where you can see how hard he must have worked on this movie.  His more recent movie Spy Hard (1996) was quite disappointing because the humor there seemed much more sexual and the parody wasn't all that great.  The only interesting part of that movie was the variety of different scenes Brooks mixed in although they didn't really blend well together.  In most movies in which you have a very rich man and his butler, the butler is quite often very funny and delivers some of the best jokes.  The best example for that would have to be John Gielgud's role in Arthur (1981) which won him a best supporting actor Oscar.  He played a wise-cracking butler who was able to be snide to his master without being too impolite.  However, I seem to find that Martey Feldman as Igor in Young Frankenstein was even funnier than John Gielgud was in Arthur.  This is the second part of Young Frankenstein.  Finally, the third part of Young Frankenstein has to with family reputation.  Gene Wilder plays Fredric Frankenstein and does not like his name because of the reputation it was given by his crazy grandfather.  He wants nothing to do with his past family but when his great grandfather's will is found and asks him to return to Transylvania, he sees no choice but to go out of respect for his predecessor.  Upon arriving in Transylvania, he quickly meets Igor and is taken to the Frankenstein castle.  There, he soon becomes obsessed with the idea of bringing a dead human being back to life.  This obsession is provoked by a woman who works at the castle and who was the mistress of Fredric's grandfather.  The rest of the story is developed in a very similar way to the original terrifying classic only in a highly comic manner.  Gene Hackman has a cameo as a blind priest and his scene is one of the funniest ones in the movie.  Mel Brooks smartly directs this movie letting the viewer hope some things happen and others won't.  Gene Wilder's contribution to the script is another plus and he delivers his role very well.  The scene in the classroom is highly comic.  Also noticeable is Teri Garr who plays young Frankenstein's assistant in the laboratory room.  But Martey Feldman walks away with the movie as the snide and hilarious butler Igor.  He plays the role of one those people who make you laugh just by appearing on the screen. You won't want to miss this one.

Basically young neurosurgeon Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder), grandson of the infamous Dr. Victor Von Frankenstein, has spent years living with the fact that his grandfather cut up bodies, made one and brought it to life. This looming over him he tries to live normally, ready to marry and settle with fianc√©e Elizabeth (Golden Globe nominated Madeline Kahn), and wanting his surname pronounced differently. Then he finds out he has inherited the castle of his grandfather where the infamous experiments were carried out, living with big-eyed hunchback servant Igor (Marty Feldman), pretty lab assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and old housekeeper Frau Bl√ºcher (Golden Globe nominated Cloris Leachman). Bl√ºcher by the way is German for glue, which is why the horses always panic whenever anyone says the word. One night, Frederick and Inga find the secret passage way behind the fast revolving bookcase, and that is when they find the laboratory where the incident happened. Reading through his grandfather's books, Frederick is convinced that he could create a creature from dead tissue all over again and this time succeed. Obviously it was due to fail when Igor took the wrong brain and he misread abnormal for Abby Normal, and when the Monster (Peter Boyle) wakes up it is chaos. The Monster does escape at one point and hang out with a Blindman (Gene Hackman), Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars) with the stiffly adjustable wooden arm starts the search for it. Frederick does get it back, and there is a big unveiling of the Monster on stage in front of a large audience to prove the creature is capable of carrying out orders, and they sing and dance as well. In the end though, the Monster is chased by a mob, and to save his experiment Frederick decides to sacrifice himself passing his soul into the other body, and vice versa, so imagine what happens when he marries Elizabeth. Also starring Richard Haydn as Herr Falkstein, Liam Dunn as Mr. Hilltop and Danny Goldman as Medical Student. Wilder makes a great mad scientist, Feldman has many fine one liners as the hunchback, Kahn gets her moments including as the bride with the big striped hair, and Hackman is good as the Blind Hermit. Filled with all the clich√©s from the great classic horrors to create the laughs, and a song and dance to go with it, it is a marvellous homage and a good fun horror spoof.

So it seems I just have a different taste in humour, I don't know...My favourite comedy movies are Life of Brian, Naked Gun, Top Secret, The Holy Grail, Airplane, Shaun of the Dead, Some Like it Hot, Dr Strangelove...do I differ so radically from other's tastes? Anyway, taking the humour aside ( which is difficult, as it's a comedy film...hence my low score! ) it's hard to fault the performances or production. The film looks wonderful, the acting is superb throughout and it's obviously been done with a lot of heart and effort.

Dr Frankenstein is initially sceptical about taking residence in his late great-grandfather's castle, but soon becomes interested when he discovers his great-grandfather's private library. Armed with a book from this library and a corpse Frankenstein begins 'experimenting' with potentially disastrous consequences.I tried watching this film in its entirety on two occasions - first time I fell asleep halfway through and being the sort of person who can't pick up on a film the next day from the halfway point I started the film again the following day. The second time I made it to about 15 minutes from the end and gave up again. I decided not to start again and just watched the last 15 minutes just so that I can say that I watched it all. That just goes to show how bored I was when watching this film....The problem I had with this film is that the story for me was very weak and rather repetitive. I also found large portions of the film unfunny simply because very little was done with the character of The Monster - I mean he's got an abnormal brain so why not make the film funnier by showing him being crazy all the time and doing made things? Poor Peter Boyle was just left grunting and snarling and whilst this perhaps is more of an accurate reflection of how The Monster behaves it doesn't make for a very good comedy film in my opinion.Wilder gives a rather Marmite performance here; infectious and amusing in the early stages, but his overacting gets worse and worse as the film progresses and he started to become tiresome towards the end. Many of the other performances are OK, but it's clear that Brooks' approach here was the louder the better - there is lots of shouting and noise which is unbearable and irritating at times.This isn't an out and out failure and there are certainly some amusing moments; the bookcase scene was brilliant and I also found it funny when Frankenstein and his creation were both singing and dancing to the song 'Putting On The Ritz'. However I only laughed twice in the 100 minute running time and I'm somewhat puzzled by the high ratings that it's getting on IMDb. I haven't seen the Frankenstein films of old so perhaps that's part of the problem. However, given the fact that this is billed as a Comedy and due to its high rating I expected to be laughing consistently and in that respect I can't help but feel a little short-changed.

The coffin lid swings open to reveal a decomposed corpse clutching a box; at this point, Mel Brooks starts with his puerile comedy, a hand trying to snatch away the box, the corpse pulling it back. It's all downhill from here-on in, the dreadfully unsophisticated humour rarely hitting the mark.It's clear that Brooks has an affection for his subject matter, such is the attention to detail in the sets and the acute cinematography, but his gags simply do not do the concept justice, the material ranging from broad farce to puerile smut. To make matters worse, Brooks frequently has his performers break the fourth wall, giving knowing looks to the audience, which is plain embarrassing. While he was at it, he should have had some of his cast apologise to the viewers for their dreadful performances as well Gene Wilder is particularly irritating, shouting his way through every scene, Marty Feldman simply mugs a lot and rolls his huge eyes, and Madeline Kahn is annoyingly shrill.The film's most credible turn comes from Peter Boyle, as the creature, who is far better than the dross he is given to work with. The movie's other saving grace is Teri Garr, as Frankenstein's sexy assistant Inga her performance is Teri-ble, but at least she is Garr-geous to look at (believe me when I say that my awful puns are no less funny than any of Brooks' gags).

The story consists of Dr. Fredrick Frankenstein (or Fronkensteen, as he likes it) who tries to bring dead corpses to life...or something like that.I forgot the story, but the movie was filmed in black-and-white. I don't know how much color was available in 1974, so they may have put it in black-and-white to save money or something like that. But, I think it was to mimic the original Frankenstein. The film is by Mel Brooks, so it's obviously a comedy. It has a few funny jokes, such as the one with the horses. But, the jokes come by few. In the last 20 minutes or so, the movie backs away from comedy and heads towards material in the original Frankestein. In the ending, Dr. Frankenstein begins to teach the monster compassion. I guess there is character development here... for the monster. Anyways, this part may be heart-warming, but it certainly isn't funny.Young Frankenstein is funny, but only creates laughs here and there.

But unfortunately that statement can't be applied to Young Frankenstein; first of all it is not art! it is monstrosity with very little merits to its name, and because over the top performances, used to compensate for poor characters, a plot that often finds itself tripping over with its pants around its ankles and ultimately a movie with no real identity; is it a horror or is it a comedy? Well during the entire duration of the film, I neither jumped nor did I laugh, therefore it is neither and thus should be tossed in the bin!

After a few films, Allen's got too introspective and artsy and Brooks' became so juvenile and cheap that both geniuses became intolerable to watch to many past fans.Young Frankenstein is one of Brooks' earliest films and like THE PRODUCERS (his first and best), it is so hilariously funny that I don't mind seeing them again and again. So why did I like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, exactly? Well, the acting was superb. I particularly loved Gene Wilder (particularly during his speech while holding a scalpel) and his sidekick, Marty Feldman,...though Cloris Leachman was also terrific as Frau Bl√ºcher. And while the film lacked the subtlety and grace of THE PRODUCERS, it was silly and dopey but still restrained compared to later Brooks films. Plus, it had a lovely black & white look that really was a wonderful homage to the Universal monsters of the 1930s.I know this will ruffle a lot of feathers, but his equally famous BLAZING SADDLES was, for me, the beginning of the end of Brooks' genius. While SADDLES had many wonderful moments, there was absolutely no restraint and the end degenerated into a horrific and stupid mess. Like Jerry Lewis, after a while his films were practically unwatchable, as there was no one on-hand to say enough or perhaps you might want to make this scene a little more subtle or doing a comedy about homeless people just can't work.

Personally I think Young Frankenstein works better as a straight beautifully crafted homage to Universial Frankenstein films rather than a spoof comedy. For me the comedy more often than not misses the mark & even on the few occasions when it doesn't I didn't find it anything more than mildly amusing. The minor gags like when Frankenstein accidentally stabs himself in the leg, the scenes when the horses keep make a noise when a certain character's name is mentioned & a scene when Frankenstein has to pretend a dead bodies arm is his own when confronted by a policeman work quite well but when the film descends into total farce like the dumb inspector with a wooden arm, Frankenstein & the monster tap dancing on stage together & a silly bit when while being throttled by the monster Frankenstein has to play charades with his assistant's to get them to help him just feel out of place & to my eyes weren't in the least bit funny. Apparently the original cut of the film was twice as long as the released one & when viewed was considered terrible so all the unfunny jokes were cut (not all of them in my opinion) & that is the version that was released & became so popular.Young Frankenstein follows the Universal Frankenstein films quite closely & many scenes are lovingly recreated like the re-animation part, the girl by the lake scene & the part when the monster meets a blind-man. The one area where the two do differ is in the ending which here is very silly & again I just didn't find funny at all. The film looks wonderful, shot in black and white with beautiful atmospheric production design which gives the film a sumptuous look. The film actually uses many of the original laboratory props & equipment from the original Universal Frankenstein (1931) which someone had kept in their garage.With a supposed budget of about $2,800,000 the production values are great & the film looks great throughout of that there is no doubt & in a way the constantly unfunny jokes & gags got in the way for me & I thought Young Frankenstein worked best when it was a straight homage to the Universal Frankenstein films. The acting is alright, Gene Wilder apparently rates this as his favourite film that he has been in while Gene Hackman originally went uncredited as the blind-man.Young Frankenstein is not the best comedy ever, it's not the best spoof ever & it's not even Mel Brook's best film, I'm sorry but I just didn't find it very funny & apart from the tremendous production design & one or two mildly amusing gags I can't see why it's so highly rated.

When talking about nowadays crappy movies in the genre (like the Scary Movies for example), I think it's safe to say that the genre of decent spoofs is dead and buried.

I expressed my admiration for his work and politely requested an autograph on a magazine, featuring Gene Wilder on the cover, that I had enclosed with a stamped addressed envelope. A month later the magazine arrived back and it had been autographed.I have no idea if the autograph is genuine. It may well have been signed by Gene Wilder, or maybe it was just signed by somebody in Gene Wilder's office. I will never know. Do you know what? I don't care.

"},{"Title":"Quite stupid, really.","Date":"12 June 2002","Score":"8 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I was hoping for a non-stop laugh fest when I bought this movie. I was in a way, expecting a classic SCARY MOVIE that spoofed the FRANKENSTEIN films. But what we have, is a stupid, unfunny Mel Brooks film. I will never in my life see another Mel Brooks movie because of how bad this film is. There absolutely no laughs at all. The only good parts of the film are the serious parts that try not to be funny. This is more of a serious movie than it is a comedy. Gene Wilder hit rock-bottom here. I do not recommend seeing this if you haven't yet. I would not wish this film on my worst enemy. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN 1/2* out of 5. "}]
