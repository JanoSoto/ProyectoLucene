[{"Title":"Ipcress Still Hip and Best","Date":"13 December 2000","Score":"86 out of 93 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Although conceived and produced by Harry Salzman and scored by John Barry, this is a film which deliberately positions itself miles away from the up until this time familiar James Bond espionage ethos. Palmer is a short sighted, class-ridden, form-signing petty criminal, co-opted into the spy service to avoid a year in jail. He lives in a bedsit and wakes up with an alarm call and not a stunning sexual conquest. Unlike Bond too, he operates in an environment which is recognisable and totally believable big echoing offices ruled by passed over Majors, where filling out forms is as important as tedious leg work and the idea of a Aston Martin as a company car would be ridiculous. The glamorous stereotypes of 007 have been replaced by the grinding, self effacing reality of the civil service, with its believable day to day grind. In short Ipcress has roots in the contemporary wave of 60's kitchen-sink drama, and not garish Bond fantasies.This is a film taking a fresh look at what has passed for a spy film before. It's fitting then that a lot of the imagery revolves around sight and seeing. Palmer's glasses are an obvious symbol of imperfect vision (exemplified by a couple of 'blurred vision' special effects in the film). The camera in turn plays avant garde tricks, shooting alternately through the crowded window of a phone booth, through glasses, ornaments and other objects and so on. This is a film in which vision, or *comprehension* - deciphering 'Ipcress' or identifying 'Albania' as really London, for instance - is finally of paramount importance. Palmer has to both see, then understand, the web that surrounds him before he identifies the traitor. At the most basic level this 'knowing' extends to his own self, through the psychological trauma he undergoes.Class, too, is an important element. Whereas the public school educated Bond would be at home conversing with Palmer's superiors, Palmer is the working class staff man, insubordinate perhaps and cocky, but one who ultimately knows his place. Even the main villain is fairly aristocratic. This makes Palmer's final choice of shot all the more relishable. In the class-ridden snobbery of the secret service it proves to be one of the elite who is suspect and must be killed. Palmer is the better man - and not just morally either his appreciation of Mozart ('proper' Mozart, too, not the appalling bandstand variety pushed on him by Daulby) and fine cooking, marks him out as a man of taste, in contrast to the surrounding snobbery and elitism.This theme of class, as well as the locations chosen for 'The Ipcress File' mark it out as a very British spy film - possibly the best one ever in contrast to the Bond cycle, which represented an attempt to create a deliberate trans-Atlantic product. One parallel serves to illustrate this difference Bond has an American agent friend (Felix Leiter), an occasional minor character in the series. In contrast Palmer shoots an American agent dead by mistake and they tail him in revenge, while another dies in his flat. There is no camaraderie here, and the snug special relationship is nowhere in sight.Over the years 'The Ipcress File' has lost none of its edge (with the possible exception of the dated 60's psychedelia which confronts Palmer in his torture chair) or punch. Utterly compulsive as a spy drama, it remains one of Caine and Furie's best films, an example of a contemporary fresh approach that still remains a classic.

The scenes are shot on location in London (I came out of my house one morning, and saw them shooting the film across the road. A friend told me that Michael Caine was in the film, and this turns out to be the film.) This film was made in the wake of the Philby, McLean et al scandal, and the film enters the British class warfare with all guns blazing. You see, these bunch of traitors were not the undependable working class, these were decent Oxbridge chaps who had had the finest education and privilege. And it was THEY who had sided with the commies. Similarly, the Profumo affair, where a minister of the Conservative government had been sharing a mistress with a Soviet diplomat, had been a nail in the coffin for the old British order. If the chaps at the top couldn't be relied on to stay loyal. How about the rabble beneath?Harry Palmer represents the new kind of British hero, just as Michael Caine represents the new kind of British film actor. Whereas in British action films hitherto, the elite were shown as efficient and brave with their OK, chaps, in you go. I'll be right behind you; here they are displayed as duplicitous, inept, and resistant to change. (Listen to the comments made about supermarkets by Col. Ross.) The new order of things is being swept away, as evinced by Major Dalby swinging away to the military band in the park, in a sparsely filled auditorium.Again and again this theme of it's the upper classes that are subversive comes up - from the very beginning, when Palmer leaves his lowly flat in Maida Vale's Formosa Street to head for a stakeout in Hamilton Terrace, one of the most exclusive streets in London. When the traitor is revealed at the end, it is a member of the establishment, who apparently believes in the system - not the insubordinate Palmer who continually cocks a snook at the system.Plenty of interesting imagery here. Notice that it is the working class Palmer who is living the most sophisticated life, from the moment he first appears in the memorable scene. Yes, the working class with their regional accents, and studying the racing pages of the newspapers have now got electric kettles, electric coffee grinders, and make their coffee in cafetieres. Another harbinger of the social change to come is the CIA agent, portrayed by a well-dressed Negro who smokes a pipe.Then there is the irony. The establishment, who hold the lower orders in utter contempt are the ones who embrace communism, a system that is supposed to be on the side of the worker, while it is lower orders, as represented by Palmer, who are trying to stop them.The spy mystery is just the tip of this iceberg, the interesting things are the changes in society that are going on underneath.

When this film was made, 1965, Britain, and British filmmaking, was exactly on the cusp between the old, class ridden, Imperial culture of films like 'Zulu', and the gritty, modern, realist school that began with films like 'Get Carter'.In '65 Britain had a Labour government after a long period of Conservative rule, and sweeping changes were about to happen which would utterly change the face of British life. 'Ipcress' bridges the gap between these two eras.On the one hand we have the upper-middle class army officers lunching at their clubs and strolling along in bowler hats with tightly furled umbrellas, and at the other extreme we have the way-out psychedelia of the interrogation chamber scene, and the grimy world of offices, warehouses, and men jumping out of vans that defined the TV and films of the 70s such as 'The Sweeney'. In the middle somewhere is Harry Palmer, who rather than being working class, is classless. He has no discernable accent, dresses plainly, likes cooking and classical music and lives in nondescript surroundings. It is only his military rank, that of sergeant, that enables us to make any kind of judgement on his social status. I think this is part of the enduring appeal of the film. Although the Dalbys of this world are long gone, Palmer would not be out of place in 2003, in fact the Palmers of this world are now the norm in many positions of British authority. Overall a fascinating period piece but one which has worn well.

This is not the Psychedelic London of Austin Powers or the Beatles, neither is it the sophisticated aristocratic London of James Bond. This London is drab and populated by civil servants & bedsits. This London is still coming to terms with the end of World War II and the advent of a modern world.Working Class Palmer is an unwilling Home Office agent with criminal tendencies who is more interested in a pay rise so that he can indulge his true passion, gourmet cooking, than serving his country. His superiors, Ross (played by Guy Doleman) & Dalby (Played by Nigel Green) represent a microcosm of the British Upper & Lower Middle Classes. Palmer is clearly more cultured in his appreciation of food, music(Mozart & Bach) & women, I like Birds Best Palmer admits to Courtney played by Sue Lloyd (of Crossroads fame in UK).Palmers superiors appear uninterested in the fate of their subordinates and this is one reason why the character of Palmer works so well, we are him, he lives our lives and we want him to win through. This perspective is aided by the stunning photography that uses every conceivable camera angle (even views from a light bulb!) to see the world from the characters perspective.Look out for the supermarket scene between Ross and Palmer, my vote for the most violent use of a supermarket Trolley in a movie.As Palmer slowly unravels the mysterious disappearance of top government scientists it becomes clear that there is someone close to the top of the British Secret service acting as a double agent. Who is it, Ross or Dalby? Who is Courtney, Palmers love interest, working for?In the background is a rather sinister looking CIA, who always appear to be one step ahead of the Brits. (A reference to the decline of Britian as a world power and its reliance on America?) Wether intentional or not, this film has captured a London of the 60's that was going through substantial social change, gone are the class paradigms that suggest that the working class could never be cultured, gone is is the unquestioning loyalty to the upper class. This world was forever changed after the war. This is a film I can watch time and time again, if only to watch the title sequence as Palmer gets up for work as if he is going to just another office job.This is a stylish movie and one of the greatest British films ever made. If you havn't seen it watch it now!

Caine plays a British secret service agent who is assigned to find out who is brainwashing the country's top scientists. This is an interesting slant on the usual cold war thriller plots and is much more believable than James Bond films, although it lacks the latter's explosive action. this is the antithesis of Bond as Caine lives on a meagre wage, has a bedsitting flat and does his own shopping! He also wears glasses and in one scene, chats up his female work colleague whilst cooking. The plot is also a lot more grown-up than its Bond counterpart - there are no cat stroking madmen intent on world domination. What makes the film is the idiosyncratic camera angles and the grainy film quality which adds to the oppressive cold war drama. The brainwashing scene is quite amusing and cliched by todays standards with psychodelic images, trippy music and You-are-getting-sleepy... type-quotes. Guy Doleman and Nigel Green head up a brilliant supporting cast which include a few familiar British faces. It is interesting to note that the film was produced by the same people who bring Bond to the screen and even the excellent soundtrack is courtesy of John Barry.

One of the best things in the movie is the fantastic camera work by its cinematographer, Otto Heller. The director and his cameraman place the camera as a sort of peeping Tom device. Mr. Furie and Mr. Heller takes us along to spy on Harry Palmer in this satisfying adaptation of Len Deighton's novel. The musical score by John Barry is another element that works well with one is witnessing.Harry Palmer came alive the way Michael Caine played him. Palmer is a man from humble origins, in sharp contrast with the rest of the people he works for, who are clearly highly educated and who look down on this man because he is different. Mr. Caine is versatile actor whose take on Harry was right on the money. We can't do anything but admire him for making this man so approachable and believable.The film was blessed with an excellent cast. Nigel Green, who plays Major Dalby makes his character come true with little effort. So does Guy Doleman as Col. Ross. Sue Lloyd, Gordon Jackson, and the rest of the actors give amazing performances.The Ipcress File shows us what London looked like in the sixties. It hasn't changed that much, but all the exteriors used in the film is a joy to watch. That speaks volumes of Otto Heller who had an eye for what to photograph, as everything fit nicely into the context of the film.

Even secret agent Harry Palmer's incarceration in what he thinks is Eastern Europe has many differences to the version in the book. The novel includes scenes in Lebanon and an American Pacific base, while this film takes place entirely in London.At one stage, Deighton's unnamed anti-hero even states that `my name isn't Harry'.That said this is still a brilliant Cold War drama and the film does retain elements of Deighton's novel his world of espionage is one of draughty back street offices, red tape and limited budgets. When he is told that he is being transferred to another intelligence unit, one of Palmer's first questions is if he will get any more money. There is also the rivalry between intelligence departments and with the Americans people working together with gritted teeth rather than devoted camaraderie against a common enemy.Michael Caine is well cast as cockney Army Sergeant Harry Palmer, a gourmet anti-hero caught up in the Great Game of espionage because the alternative was prison. As well as a smug and double-dealing enemy like Erik Grantby (Frank Gatliff), Palmer has to cope with bureaucracy, a measly pay and distrusting superiors like Major Dalby (Nigel Green) and Colonel Ross (Guy Doleman).Although made by the same people who produced the James Bond films, this could not be more different. In contrast to Bond's life as a millionaire playboy, Palmer lives in an East End flat, has to do his own shopping and cooking, has limited resources and budgets and never-ending paperwork.Gordon Jackson also lends good support as Jock Carswell, the only fellow agent whom Palmer can trust or likes; Jean Courtney (Sue Lloyd) has an affair with Palmer, but is really keeping tabs on him. In the original novel Carswell is another bureaucrat a la Dalby and Ross for whom the unnamed narrator has little time for. Jackson's character is actually based on Carswell's assistant Murray.

With the boost in manpower, Harry Palmer finds himself taken off surveillance duties and put into a new unit under Major Dalby to find Radcliffe and capture Bluejay. Never one for following the rules, Palmer struggles to keep up to date with his paperwork while trying to make progress in the mission &#150; the bureaucracy making his job as hard as the opposite side. However soon he makes progress and finds himself drawn into a deadly web involving treachery, American agents and a plan to 'brain drain' the UK and weaken its powers.Although it has dated in some regards, The Ipcress File stands up well as a sort of answer to the Bond ideal of the British Secret Service. While it is much more fun to have a series of slick action moves and fantasy plots, this film's focus on structure and managers is much more realistic (one assumes) and also allows for a solid, if unspectacular, story but also some amusing digs at the civil service. The plot moves slowly but is still an engaging thriller even if it slowly unfolds rather than explodes along &#150; while this may put off many who prefer things to go 'bang' every few minutes I found it to be enjoyable and quite engaging. On top of this the film pokes fun at the UK civil service with a great deal of relish (but not sticking out as doing so). I have worked in a council and a Government funded charity and can confirm that this aspect of the film has not dated &#150; the UK still is very much to do with paperwork and having all the forms filled in correctly, for example &#150; tried to fill in any tax forms lately?! The film makes good sport of this aspect of Palmer's job and shows the fussy management structure of his department as being almost as much of a threat to national security as Bluejay himself is!The cast is pretty good but it is Michael Caine's film all the way. He is suitably acerbic in his wit and has the browbeaten look many of us get when we feel we are being stopped from 'doing our jobs' by having to spend too much time filling in forms! However, while also still making this point, Caine still makes Palmer effective enough for the audience to get behind him and still see him as a spy and the fact that Caine always brings his own screen presence to the role helps as well. Support is also good from Green, Doleman, Gatliff and Jackson but Caine is the one you'll remember.Overall this is not a great film but it is a good one. When viewed alongside other spy thrillers this one will appear very slow but I still found the story to be enjoyable if low key. The portrayal of the civil service as one of paperwork and managers adds a nice layer to a story that is already pretty good in its own right. Not to everyone's taste and it helps if you can appreciate Palmer's situation but it is a good espionage tale that rewards patience with a good story that is happily lacking in Hollywood excesses and empty spectacle.

This was the first of three films to depicted the normal activities and dangerous and extreme situations of British intelligence agent Harry Palmer(played by Michael Caine who became an international star with his portrayal of the working stiff/British spy). This was an espionage thriller that went straight by the book and then some which is based on Len Deighton's best selling novel. This was in no way compare to the James Bond spy flicks that came out the same time as this one,but this was totally different and for a very good reason. Palmer was a 9 to 5 stiff who was going by a measly paycheck,meeting in drab locations and of course has to sign for everything he gets including getting an issued gun and also getting transportation to get to and from his assignments and so forth as the story proceeds. You don't know whether not to like or dislike the character as he is in constant danger at every turn as his closest friends he meets at the office becomes his deadliest enemies out to kill him at any cost with an unglamourous death in the wings as you the viewer be grabbing your seat and hoping the outcome will end up with. Caine's performance as the drab agent is a must see and it also concludes toward the end of who the villain is and who is trying to frame him as well as kill him. Cliffhanging suspense! This was one of the most tense and stylish thriller of all time which in one point makes it so realistic that makes it distinctive from all the others in its genre. While British agent 007 was fantasy,Palmer was real and down to earth and it shows. A working class Joe. Caine goes on to make two more Palmer films that were not as successful as the first one;Funeral in Berlin(1966),and the last one  The Billion Dollar Brain(1969),but in all this one was a gem of a good spy flick.

The scene with the Land Rover is one of my all-time favorites.  A final touch is the clever spin on British Intelligence, which makes espionage look like a nine-to-five stint, and leaves out the James Bond gadgets and preposterously named sex bombs Bond cavorts with.

I think it`s both which is a strength and weakness for THE IPCRESS FILE , a strength because we`re shown that intelligence work is composed of nothing more dynamic than sitting in an office all day looking through files and checking out leads ( Factually correct I imagine ) and a weakness because not many film goers will be interested in watching a spy movie involving an agent who spends much of his time behind a desk and there are maybe a bit too many scenes set in an office . There`s another problem with THE IPCRESS FILE and that`s once you know who the traitor is the surprise only works once , likewise once Harry escapes from his prison cell we`re treated to a shock revelation and I remember thinking this was a very clever plot twist first time I saw it but seeing it again tonight it doesn`t carry much of an impact . Unlike a Bond adventure people aren`t going to rewatch this movie again and again To be positive though Michael Caine is absolutely superb as Harry Palmer and it`s easy to see why he was an icon of British culture in the 1960s , he plays the part in an understated manner and whoever would have thought someone wearing specs and a raincoat could be quite so cool ?

Caine is not your average spy, in fact, he's doing the job to keep from going to prison.

When the guard returns to the train to give it to him, the scientist is gone and someone else is in his place. Thus begins the work of getting him back and ferreting out a double agent. The film, based on the Deighton novel, probably reflects the Profumo scandal that rocked Britain, and shows the smart, patriotic boys to be the Caines of the world and not the traitorous upper crust. Caine is excellent as Palmer - dry, funny, and clever, all the while cooking gourmet food, shopping for only the best, and listening to Mozart.

When I discovered that it was released in 1965, I developed an enormous respect for it and have always made time to enjoy repeats (being of exceptional quality for it's time, as it has still preserved most of it's essence today).  It is the best of the Harry Palmer espionage series, which is on the same wavelength as Funeral in Berlin which was nowhere near as good in my humble opinion.  I found it to be one of the best and most under rated espionage films of all time. Michael Caine plays the role of the British intelligence agent Harry Palmer and brilliantly delivers a reality to this film in ways that most other movies of similar nature fail. In contrast to other fictitious characters from other espionage movies and novels, where the main characters all seem to be very one dimensional, Palmer appears more like a real person. Apart from his skills as an intelligence officer, he also has a personal character which is rarely exhibited by the main characters of other espionage films.  He shows his personality in his passion for cooking ( being fussy when in the supermarket while looking at canned button mushrooms) and music when he puts on a record of Mozart when preparing dinner in the presence of a lady guest. The movie begins with the scene during the music score, when he gets up to prepare his coffee by grinding fresh coffee beans to place in his plunger while preparing to get to work. He has an enormous amount of patience with his colleagues at work as he endures all kinds of ordeals to get through with his mission in style. He never complains and shows his modesty by never answering back, when ridiculed by insults from his colleagues. As a high quality British intelligence agent, he soon suspects that he is confronted by a double agent and selects wisely when put in a difficult position.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone that can see beyond the entertainment side of this movie.  It has all the ingredients of the espionage thriller that would satisfy those who seek something outside the square.

You can not trust anybody including your wife and your Boss in the Spy Business. This Film made Michael Caine famous and Len Deighton too. The Photography is also typical of the Sixties. Although I like Len Deighton, I think the film is better than the Book which is long and a bit tiring. 2008 I now have the DVD of Ipcress File and I would like to add that The Photography is Excellent, You feel that you are in London of the 60's and the Cold War.

After a fight with one of Grantby's goons, he returns to his captain with the bad news that he has been unsuccessful. The captain is for obvious reasons, not pleased.In an abandoned warehouse, Palmer finds a small piece of tape with the name IPCRESS on, but at this point in the movie, has no idea what it means, if anything. Later on, though, he learns that it is an abbreviation of Induction of Psychoneuroses by Conditioned Reflex Under Stress. When a scientist suddenly appears, with a strange memory loss, all the dots are about to get connected.The Ipcress File is an old movie, but not so old that you are bored by the plot, dialogue or even images. It starts out with a mysterious disappearance from a train and a murder. Who did this and for what reasons? Then we meet a young Michael Caine, this time playing an agent called Harry Palmer, who is taken from his job on a stakeout, to investigating the murder and disappearance. He is no James Bond, and thank you very much for that. In Harry Palmer we meet a real person with real routines, real emotions and who can speak like a real person without a single one-liner. For these very reasons, this is a very satisfying movie.I quite liked this movie, and while the colors are a bit faded and the dialogue a bit stiff, it actually felt contemporary, and the plot itself is as relevant today as it was back in 1965. The drama is not big car chases or rivers of blood, it is the drama between people, people that feel real and with real relationships. Also, the Harry Palmer character is not without humor, especially in the scenes with the young Jean (Sue Lloyd) who has been asked by her superior to learn more about Palmer.As far as agent movies go, this is one of the better that I have seen in a while. If you are thinking of seeing Skyfall&#x85; don't&#x85; go rent this movie instead. You'll be the better person for it.

One of the best British characters in a spy film ever created. Michael Caine's insubordinate, authority-bucking, laconic and borderline seedy Harry Palmer was a flip-side to Bond's more fantasy-driven persona. He's down-at-heel, semi-criminal and blackmailed by the British government into being a spy. A working-class bum with some gourmet aspirations and generally a bit of a loser more or less.Palmer, unlike Bond, is seldom in control in this murky world of danger and espionage. He doesn't know who to trust and he makes mistakes. It's notable also for being one of the first major films in which the lead character wears glasses not for comic effect or as a disguise, but because he has impaired vision. There's a great scene where he takes them off and casually slips them into his pocket before physically assaulting a heavy who's been following him.It's tense, atmospheric, with a great sense of time, place and lashings of cold war ambiance. Tightly directed by Sidney J. Furie, gripping cinematography by Otto Heller (all inventive angles with a gritty, photo-realistic aesthetic) and a killer score by the maestro, John Barry; everything just about hits all the right notes.Saltzman produced and it gave him another big hit outside of the Bond franchise.For anyone interested in 60s British espionage cinema, I would highly recommend it, along with the two sequels - FUNERAL IN BERLIN and BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN.The original Len Deighton novels are also a must for those who might like to get an inkling of what Raymond Chandler might have produced if he had been a cockney military historian and cookery writer penning spy books in Britain in the swinging 60s.

If you are looking for spies who constantly engage beautiful girls and spar with menacing looking Asian thugs, you're in the wrong theater. Books like Len Deighton's The Impcress File are designed to be 'the thinking man's secret agent.' Once in, you will follow the exploits of Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) who's background reveals is an ex-burglar and jewel thief who has been recruited from prison by M.I.6 for espionage work. He is a gourmet when it comes to wine, women, foods, beverages and loves classical music. His immediate boss is Colonel Ross (Guy Doleman) who constantly reminds Sargent Palmer he is in the military branch of the secret service and will act accordingly. In this segment, Palmer has been transferred to counter-intelligence work under Major Dalby (Nigal Green) who is investigating the Brain-Drain in England. Several top scientists have either been kidnapped or cease to function in the laboratory. Dalby is ordered by Ross to find out why. Dalby assigns Palmer to the case who learns quickly and despite Dalby's policies, has his own way of doing things. Through his inquiries, he learns of a highly experimental but success process which turns people into catatonic zombies. This method is called Induction of Psychoneuroses by Condition reflex under stress or simply Impcress. To complicate Palmer's investigation is the suspicion there is a 'mole or spy inside M.I.6 who is trying his best to discredit or kill Palmer and will go so far as to kidnaps and subject him to the Impcress treatment. If you are looking for a film which requires you to think through a mystery, this is the film for you. Producer Harry Saltzman was extremely successful with the Harry Palmer series and this movie is no exception. With seasoned actors like Sue Lloyd playing Jean Courtney and Gordon Jackson as Carswell, it has garnered enough accolades to render it a classic. **** "},{"Title":"Great film that stands re-watching many times","Date":"17 October 2008","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" Far and away better than any Bond film.

We find one of them simply feeding pigeons at his office window. These men squabble at a professional level, but at least to all appearances they are on the same side. Later we find them both walking in what looks like Green Park, comparing the menus at their respective clubs. For them, Britain seems changeless.Seargent Palmer is a devious near-criminal with a healthy contempt for authority. Cool, laconic and irreverently working-class, our quietly- spoken, bespectacled anti-hero is a new kind of spy who mixes action with brains in an understated way. But Palmer is vanguard to the social changes that are coming. His speech is eloquent and he's picked-up on good food and music, fresh grinding his own coffee for breakfast. He wasn't taut these things as a kid.Something's going wrong with British scientists, and the department to which Palmer is seconded must find out what's happening. There's a great deal more than at first meets the eye. Nobody is quite what they seem. You can't trust anyone completely.With very little warning, Palmer finds himself captured by 'the enemy' and in danger of being brainwashed like some of the scientists.As I say; there are wonderful little comic touches throughout the movie. At a branch fronting as a bespoke staffing agency, we see a disaffected job-applicant leaving in a huff 'I might as well have gone to the labour exchange'. On another occasion, Palmer and one of his superiors engage in an disagreement at a small supermarket. Their exchanges are emphasised by a trolley-ramming contest. There is yet more humour in the petty inter-departmental office-politics.By the same token, drama is equally slick. Death is sudden and unexpected. During an exchange, Palmer machine-guns an American Agent to death. Slyly we see proceedings in miniature through the dead agent's discarded spectacles. It's original (for its time) wicked and fun. In response, Palmer's colleague - played by the likable Gordon Jackson - is shot through the head, whilst waiting at traffic-lights in what appears to be a case of mistaken identity. Here's some dialogue; 'The Americans have put a tail on Palmer.' 'Really? How tiresome'. Perfect.The 'spectacle trick' is one of many similar plays on indirect observation. We study characters through car windows, telephone boxes, we peer over the tops of their desks as if from a crouched position. A dead suspect is barely glimpsed between the grating of his cell-door. We look down on another dead agent from the unlikely perspective of the room's light shade. It's as if the viewer has also been seconded into the spying game. There are lots of other novel tricks too. A conversation between two is portrayed by focusing from one to the other instead of changing the camera angle or working a second close-up. It's as much fun to watch what the director and cameraman are doing as the play between the actors themselves. How much more engaging modern movies could be if makers would only take the time to study older classics instead of resorting to foul language, cheap special effects or pyrotechnics. Almost none of which appear in this work.Throughout the movie, incidental music pops-up in various tempos as laconic as the man himself, to emphasise suspense, tedium, or just the melancholy passage of time. Lead is usually played by base guitar, it's a well-tried 1960's style; the spartan cords work well in both a macho, and suspenseful presentation. But there's another instrument too with which I'm unfamiliar.Even the last lines contain an element of dry wit Palmer; 'I could have been killed, or driven mad, or anything.' Reply; 'Well, it's what you're paid for.'This is the movie that propelled Micheal Caine to overnight stardom. And it was well-earned. But the supporting cast also deserve full credit for the Sterling efforts they make. Lighting is excellent, frequently slipping into a noirish style. Editing is also unexpected and keeps you guessing as it lingers upon some seeming trivia, drawing out the moment, then at other times cutting with shock suddenness. It's an inventive, droll, and suspenseful classic from a time when British cinema could still hold its own.

No, that's not even true &#x96; I actively dislike many of them. As a Sixties lad I saw some of the early Sean Connery Bonds and soon grew bored of the standard oh-so predictable formula. Later came the jokey Bonds with the bad pubs and fibre-glass scenery and I didn't bother, ever. Why exactly? I have since happened to catch glimpses of several of them on TV when keeping company with my housebound stroke victim stepmother, so I haven't actually not seen them, but I never actively went to the flicks or turned on the TV to watch one. In my view they are tacky, boring crap. The only Bond film I have liked even a little bit was the most recent Daniel Craig offering, Skyfall, but even it's two immediate preceding Craig offerings left me quite cold. So a film such as The Ipcress File is a very welcome change from all that stylised, macho schtick.It is worth noting that The Ipcress File with Michael Caine (who, admittedly, seems to portray no one else on screen but Michael Caine, though as I like him as an actor, that is no bad thing) was also a Sixties film, shot in 1965, but in its deviousness it is in a different league. The plot is pretty standard, but it is in its execution, by director Sidney Furie and his cinematographer Otto Heller (I had to look it up) is good to very good and, in my view at least, it has helped The Ipcress File stand the test of time.There is none of that utterly spurious spy glamour in Furie's (and writer Len Deighton's) spy world &#x96; the security services are just another department of the Civil Service for those it employs &#x96; and the whole film, when it counts, exudes menace, the lack of focus which is necessarily at the heart of spying &#x96; after all no on really knows what's going on.Forty years on it is salutary to reflect on what can be done with imaginative lighting and camera-work. These days there directors have far many more resources to fall back on - not least CGI effects - and all too often still produce nothing but formulaic clunkers.The Ipcress File isn't James Bond, but for that be grateful. If you can catch it and, like me, the whole 007 schtick leaves you cold, watch it. You will most certainly enjoy its ins and outs.

Suffice to say that Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) discovers the cause of all the trouble, but only after a considerable degree of suffering at the hands of a torturer (Frank Gatliff).What makes Sidney J. Furie's film so memorable is its shooting-style (photography by Otto Heller). It makes use of the basic shot- reverse shot sequence, but every frame is partially obscured by an object, or person placed close to the camera; we seldom see the characters' faces in full profile. This strategy helps to create an atmosphere of menace, where nothing is quite as it seems, and every mission suggested to Harry by his two bosses Dalby (Nigel Green) and Ross (Guy Doleman) appears to have ulterior motives behind it that Palmer remains blissfully unaware of. Palmer himself retains his integrity throughout, even if he perceives himself as something of a rebel within the Secret Service.THE IPCRESS FILE is a direct antithesis of the Bond canon of films, also popular at the time of release. It is set in a grimy, rain- sodden London full of gray buildings and dark interior; no exotic locations for this spy. The most colorful aspect of the mise-en- scene are the big old-fashioned Routemaster buses that drive up and down familiar streets - Piccadilly, Whitehall, Oxford Street. Palmer himself lives in a shabby apartment; his one concession to the so-called 'Swinging Sixties' spirit is an ability to cook, but no one, not least his colleague Jean (Sue Lloyd) seems especially interested. The film inevitably incorporates some of the sexist attitudes of the time - for Palmer all women are birds, and they do not become actively involved in any espionage activity. The film is a very masculinist piece, with legions of actors dressed in long coats, trilby hats and dark suits. Palmer himself has a good sartorial sense, but even he adopts the same uniform, especially when in pursuit of the enemy.Michael Caine, in a pre-ALFIE role, shows all the cockiness characteristic of his youthful period, when he really believed he could challenge the status quo. Whether he succeeds or not is very much open to debate.

The case is more difficult than usual since the British agents have reasons to believe that one of their own works for the enemy.What makes this film different from the films of the Jame-Bond 007 series is that it portrays a different and more realistic life of intelligence agents that is not glamorized or romanticized. Instead their lives can be more boring but also more deadly at the same time whereby little details can make the difference between life or death especially if the enemy may anticipate your moves.Eventually Palmer manages to resolve the case he works on (and also stay alive) not because he has the best weaponry or the best information but simply because he follows his instincts.I recommend this film if you are looking for a good mystery and intense thriller. It may have a bit outdated feel now since the cold war is over but do not let this deter you from seeing the good film that it is. An 8/10 from me. Note This is the first film where Michael Caine portrays the 'Harry Palmer' fictional character.

Michael Caine as Harry Palmer, a sergeant in army intelligence, gets out of bed, goes to the kitchen and makes his morning cup of coffee. The camera follows him as he grinds the beans, spoons out the coffee, and finally adds boiling water. Later in the film he makes an omelette, expertly breaking the eggs with one hand while chatting to a female colleague. These are important scenes in The Ipcress File; they establish the character's point of difference. Spy films proliferated in the 60's, inspired by the Cold War and the success of the James Bond films. Each new entry in the genre presented a bit of business that would help it stand out from the crowd. Bond may have had his Aston Martin and his debonair style but Harry Palmer had his horn-rimmed glasses and his domestic virtues. Harry Palmer is good at what he does but invariably rubs his superiors the wrong way. He is posted to British Counter-Intelligence to track down Dr. Radcliffe, a scientist who has been kidnapped by an international group of criminals who will try to sell him to the highest bidder &#x96; East or West. Palmer is under the command of Major Dalby played by Nigel Green, but finds his previous boss, the snobbish Colonel Ross, played by Guy Dolman, still hovering on the scene. Double agents and brainwashing were two of the favourite plot devices of movies from the period, and The Ipcress File ticks both items on the checklist. When the missing scientist is returned, it is discovered that he has been brainwashed. The claims for the effectiveness of brainwashing in movies have become more preposterous over time. Although the techniques on view in The Ipcress File are not the most far-fetched, they are nonetheless the least convincing aspects of the film. They consist of a high-pitched noise and cheap disco effects projected onto the subject strapped to a chair inside a metal container. Michael Caine plays Palmer with that same air of insolence that he brought to nearly all his roles in the first half of his career. The film also strips away any glamour espionage may have had. The operatives spend a great deal of time filling out forms &#x96; L101's and Motor Pool Requisitions. Mostly it's just legwork, explains Jock, a colleague Palmer befriends played by Gordon Jackson.A noticeable feature of the film is the camera work. After nearly 50 years, this appears as eccentric rather than chic. Many scenes are shot with the view obscured by what appears to be the nearest piece of furniture. Other scenes are shot at gravity defying angles. Although these effects now seem quaint and overly self-conscious, The Ipcress File is still a sharply told tale. It seemed that no British spy movie of the period was complete without a John Barry score. Barry was very experimental during the 60's, and produced one brilliant score after another including this one for The Ipcress File with effective use of the cimbalom in the main theme.Even if The Ipcress File doesn't qualify for classic status, Caine is still a good reason to watch this film, he gave it a unique edge back then that still makes it easy to watch today.

The plot could have come from Bond, or even an episode of The Avengers; somebody is kidnapping British scientists and, we later learn, brainwashing them! Palmer is part of a team investigating the latest disappearance, knowing the only person capable of organising the kidnapping they offer to buy him back but the man they get isn't the man he used to be... he has forgotten all information concerning his latest breakthrough. As Palmer starts to close in on his target he is set up for the murder of a CIA agent and ordered to lay low for a while but as he does so he is snatched and held captive while his captor attempts to brainwash him; will he be able to resist these techniques and contact his boss or will he become a pawn of his captor? I rather enjoyed this film; while it might not be a classic due to its rather far-fetched central premise which would be more suited to a lighter style, it is still fairly gripping and there are some nice twists to keep things interesting. While it is true that Michael Caine only seems to play Michael Caine whatever the role that doesn't matter in the slightest as he does it so well and hardly ever disappoints. While there wasn't much in the way of real action things were kept fairly tense; especially in the scenes were he was in captivity. I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes spy thrillers or fans of Michael Caine.

There are positive and negative commentaries on each component of the foregoing analysis depending on one's point of view, however just like a card game and the random nature of what comes up, this movie is what it is.......ie a novel portrayal of the nearly subjugated British way of life in a postwar funk. The unique and curious British culture and style which survived the Nazi attempt to abolish it, was now kicking and clawing to survive in the post WWII Cold War. Here we have a spy flick showing that inimitable British effort with the real workers in England, the lower middle and upper middle class... not the aristocracy, which was the style of portraying characters in British movies traditionally. Likable characters like Caine, and unlikeable ones representing the administrative and bureaucratic side of England's socialist leaning culture was a new adventure away from previous spy movies. The eerie and spellbinding Hungarian dulcimer instrument used throughout the movie's soundtrack added emotional impact which is forever impacted into my brain (not unlike the screeching violins during the Psycho shower scene.) By identifying with the skeptical and individualistic attitude of Caine's character, I seemed to empathize his torture experience far more than in other movies. The trigger phrase Now listen to me seemed to be a powerful simulation of brain washing technique and was used equally for same effect in The Manchurian Candidate. Overall, The Ipcress File left a favorable impact on my psyche such that I am spellbound by watching many different scenes throughout the movie. The encounters with spying, his bosses, the women in his apartment, his cooking, his close calls, the torture scenes, etc. are not particularly earth shattering cinematic achievements, but rather the interesting likable character Caine portrays and the eminent danger and the mysterious music all came together to make this a very interesting and emotionally provocative art piece.

Of course there's room in the cinematic universe for both and I personally wouldn't be without either. Here, Michael Caine, as Harry Palmer, in another iconic role (c.f. Zulu, Alfie, Get Carter etc) is plucked from mundane CI5 (or equivalent) obscurity to front-line field-work where his maverick nature and unorthodoxly direct instincts set him on the trail of foreign agents who kidnap, brainwash and then return for ransom, high-ranking British scientists. The Brain Drain indeed. Along the way he interacts with his terribly pukka-pukka superiors who operate out of massive offices in the heart of London, his new colleagues, principally stalwarts and later long-running UK TV stars Gordon Jackson and Sue Lloyd before confronting head bad guy Bluejay, played with élan if not exactly menace by Mohammed Al-Fayed lookalike Frank Gatliff. Director Furie uses every possible quirky camera-angle to keep the viewer off-guard, but probably overdoes it, no doubt a 60's infection. And yes, the brainwashing scene loses a lot in comparison to its previous depiction in Frankenheimer's superior The Manchurian Candidate and with its lapsing into subsequent cliché in any number of 60's TV dramas (Star Trek, Man From Uncle, hey - Joe 90 anyone, never mind Austin Powers!!!) but the who-to-kill? conclusion is genuinely suspenseful and leaves you wondering (like Cagney's cowardice at the end of Angels With Dirty Faces) as to whether Palmer kills the right man because of or despite his conditioning - after all he does shoot the traitor. Best of all though is Caine, now hitting his stride in starring vehicles, hardly having to break accent or native mannerisms, one suspects, in depicting the altogether less-than-superhuman secret agent, Palmer. Nice to see shots of contemporary London too, red buses everywhere, oh, and lest I forget, John Barry's soundtrack is as good as you'll hear for any movie...

The film has a storyline which promises many twists, leaving you with one question who is the traitor? I can promise you, you'll change your mind many times in this film. The scenes are all remarkably set. For example there is one really tense scene, no suspense music, just the ambiance of the location. Guns being pointed at each other, your just covering your eyes asking when the deal's going to go horribly wrong and a bullet in someone's head&#133;although we have a twist once again.

In the '60s, anyone who saw it, enjoyed and understood it was deemed an intellectual. The thick frame of Harry Palmer's glasses (my guess is that it was a Monarch brand from Germany) added to that impression. And let's say it, the young Michael Caine was smashingly handsome in just the right way -- not too rugged as to be disgusting but not too soft to be effeminate.It's simply all about extracting information from scientists and brainwashing them afterwards. What is interesting is how the persona of Palmer is presented. Ditto the characterization of British intelligence bureaucracy as snooty, ruthless and uncaring of its agents.Some of the skills I would have liked to pick up after seeing the movie 1. How to count bundles of money real fast (the scene where the ransom of a missing scientist took place) 2. How to hold eggs in between your fingers and break them one after the other without making a mess (Palmer while cooking dinner for his love interest. Caine used to be a baker after all.) 3. How to use pain to counteract brainwashing.I found touching the final scene when his control finally considers acceding to his standing request for a salary advance to buy a car. I think he was planning on a Mini. This after his bosses betray him by practically delivering him to the enemy from whom he escaped through sheer resourcefulness by the skin of his teeth.Palmer replied I'd rather walk.

Aside from dealing with the Cold War, we get to see mid-'60s London. Specifically, Palmer lives in a dreary flat but is called to investigate things involving geopolitics.Some people note that this was around the same time as the James Bond movies but The Ipcress File was more intellectual.

Although The Ipcress File was also produced by Harry Saltzman, it deliberately presents a quite different picture of life in the British Secret Service. Bond is a glamorous figure who lives a life of luxury, travels to exotic locations, drives expensive cars and seduces a succession of beautiful young women.The central character of this film is Harry Palmer, a former sergeant in the army who only joined the Secret Service because the alternative was serving time in a military prison for fraud and corruption. He lives in a flat in a Victorian terrace house in what today would be an extremely desirable location but which in the sixties was still seedy and downmarket. He does not get to travel the world- the entire film is set in London. He drives a Ford Zephyr rather than an Aston Martin and his love interest, Jean Courtney, is far from being a Bond girl. (Joan Collins was considered for the role, but was presumably rejected for being too glamorous). Like Bond, Palmer is a lover of good food, but does all his own cooking and has to shop in a supermarket. We learn that his annual salary is £1,400- a decent working wage in 1965, but hardly sufficient to finance a lifestyle like Bond's.The biggest difference between the two, however, can be summed up by saying that Palmer is a spy whereas Bond is an agent. The word agent is derived from the Latin agere, meaning to do, from which we also derive the word actor. The word spy comes ultimately from the root, meaning to watch, that gives us the word spectator. Bond is an actor in a drama, Palmer a spectator. I was interested by the reviewer who pointed out that sight is important in this film. Unusually for the hero of a thriller, he wears spectacles (another word from the same root as spy), and there are frequent references to implements such as cameras and binoculars. The images during the brainwashing sequence reflect the sixties fascination with all things psychedelic.Unlike Bond's, Harry's work is dull and bureaucratic, spent in watching suspects from draughty attics and then completing field reports and other routine paperwork. Much of the time he speaks in the sort of acronyms beloved of the British civil service but unintelligible to outsiders. Whereas M speaks to Bond as a social equal (they are probably members of the same London club), Harry is patronised by his upper-class superiors, Colonel Ross and Major Dalby, who see him as unreliable and insubordinate, an NCO with unwarranted ambitions to join the officer class.This was Michael Caine's second starring role; the first was Zulu, made the previous year. In that film he had played an upper-class army officer, but Palmer was the first of a number of working class heroes he was to play over the next few years. (Other examples include Alfie, Jack Carter and Charlie Croker from The Italian Job). The politics of social class are, in fact, much in evidence in this film. This is perhaps not surprising given that the sixties were the heyday of the kitchen sink school of British film-making, which sought to give greater prominence to the lives of working-class people, but the theme of class distinctions took on added significance in a spy thriller. In 1950 Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean, both members of the Cambridge ring of Soviet spies had defected to avoid exposure, and in 1963 a third member of the ring, Kim Philby, had also defected. (Since 1965 it has come to light that there were two further members, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross). Burgess, MacLean and Philby were all from privileged, Establishment backgrounds, so their treachery caused some consternation in Britain. Unlike some countries, such as France and Italy, Communism had very little mass appeal in Britain (by the sixties the party could never attract more than a derisory vote in elections), but it remained the opium of a certain type of bourgeois intellectual who perhaps imagined that after the Revolution the dictatorship of the proletariat would in practice be a dictatorship of themselves.The plot concerns MI5's attempts to investigate the kidnapping of a number of British government scientists and the involvement of a shady Albanian-born businessman with links to the KGB. As is common in spy thrillers, there is an atmosphere of betrayal and mistrust. Harry is never sure whom he can trust, even among his colleagues. It becomes clear that either Ross or Dalby is working for the Russians, but Harry cannot be certain which. (Was the name Dalby, I wonder, chosen because of its closeness to Philby?) There is a certain amount of dry humour, particularly in-jokes. (One line is You've forgotten your camera, Dr Radcliffe. This is a reference to the Radcliffe Camera, which is not a device for taking photographs, but a well-known university building in Oxford). As a spy thriller it still works well, and generates considerable tension, particularly towards the end, but it is also watchable today because of the insights it provides into the political and social concerns of its era. 7/10.

The traditional choice used to be Germany but World War II is slipping down the memory hole and one out of five of today's students think that Germany and the US fought Russia in World War II. The USSR was good for a while but with the dissolution of the Soviet Union it's gotten less common. There has been the occasional Israeli heavy (Eye Witness) or the Irish nationalist (The Devil's Own) but the villain usually represents some splinter group of renegade, so the Jews and the Irish shouldn't be upset.Albania makes a nice villainous place and provides plenty of opportunities for villainy. First of all there's no audience to be offended. Nobody can place Albania on a map. In fact, there may be no such place, even though in the underground classic, Tune In Tomorrow, I was an Albanian protesting against a negative portrait of Albanians in the media, exactly like what we see in this production.Well, that's neither here nor there; don't bother saying it. This movie is about Michael Caine as Harry Palmer, a Brit working for one of those intelligence or counterespionage agencies that the Brits have so many of. A scientist kidnapped by a group that are apparently Albanians, although it's never made entirely clear. The British buy the scientist back but his memory has been erased.MI5 or MI6 or MI7 is determined to get to the bottom of this and Caine leads the way, at some cost to himself and his friends. Caine plays the agent as smooth and heterosexual. He's also half blind without his glasses. This was 1965 and by this time, the pluperfect James Bond character may have begun to seem mechanical rather than human. He had no weaknesses or vices. So Harry Palmer had to be invested with some recognizably hominid traits.It's really rather amusing at times, as it's meant to be. All of Caine's superiors have fixed expressions of disdain or irony. One of them, Guy Doleman, is rolling his shopping cart down a supermarket aisle while musak murmurs in the background. Never cared for these American shopping habits, he remarks, and, examining a tin of Chef Boyardee, Beefaroni -- extraordinary! The photography is dark and Sidney Furie, the director, is trying to figure out how to be innovative with the camera. He fails because instead of Nouvelle Vague we get hide-and-seek. Many scenes are shot from floor level for no particular reason. And every other shot seems to be peeking over a lampshade or through a hole in the door of a prison cell. Sometimes an object hides most of the image and we don't know what the object is.The plot is nonsense from a psychological point of view but that doesn't matter. A new method of brainwashing is not so different from any of the gadgets that 007 carries around. If it's not taken seriously, and if you can get over the annoyance of looking up at someone sipping from a cup of tea from the perspective of his shoe laces, it's kind of fun. The droll dialog and Caine's balmy delivery make it an enjoyable diversion.

Then, rather out of the blue, two more in the 1990s. It's a shame he didn't make more in the 60s and 70s as they were very good films--ones that left me far more satisfied than most of the James Bond movies--though I would not say that about the later films in the series. Why? Because even the most outlandish one of these films (The Billion Dollar Brain) was far more realistic than Bond films. There were no gadgets, Palmer was smart but no superman and when a woman threw herself at him, he immediately suspected her motives. After all, he was just a guy who wore glasses and seemed anything but glamorous. Now I cannot comment about how closely this character and these plots were to the original Len Deighton novels (where Harry was NOT blackmailed into working for the service), as I've never read them, but the films are wonderfully entertaining.In The Ipcress File, Harry has apparently made a mess of his military career and instead of sending him to prison, the government has decided to make him a spy--as he IS resourceful...though also a bit disdainful of authority. However, his boss, the Colonel, has decided to reassign him to work for the Major. Why? Well, this becomes apparent late in the film.It seems that Harry's assignment is to discover what is happening to so many important agents and scientists. Eventually, they find one of these missing folks--and his mind has been wiped clean! What happened? Who did this and how? Apparently the word 'Ipcress' is the key. I could easily say more but want you to just see it for yourself. As I mentioned above, the Palmer character seems real. Part of this is the writing and part of it is the nice characterization by Michael Caine. Regardless, the film has lots of originality and style. Well worth seeing.

However his life of paperwork and tedium is about to come to a rude, unwelcome and unwanted end.Cinema is now an art form that has its antiques. Ancient antiques (silents) and modern antiques (such as this one). While value or enjoyment is a personal thing this is - to me - far more enjoyable today than when it was made or when it first got shown on TV. While clearly an answer to the slick and flash nonsense that was the, then, emerging James Bond franchise this is a product that can do nothing but divide. Probably along the lines of those that want escapism or those that want a story with at least one foot on the ground.The UK was, at that time, generally behind the USA in all technologies. This was the time when the supermarket was being introduced on to the market (hell holes of fluorescent lighting) and the NHS was still prepared to fix you up with a pair of cheap glasses. Caine even made wearing them look semi-cool - although he is portrayed here as a man of low morals. Something that was probably needed in the game he was in.The John Barry soundtrack plays a bigger role than you might think - indeed it is central to the whole con that is played out on the viewer. Quite how he scored all these films in such as short period of time I do not know. Maybe I should ask him when he returns home to our common home city of York.The cold war was built on the idea that it could - in time - become a hot war and no art form will be able to recreate the mood and the atmosphere to those that haven't lived it. The UK version of spying was a very much hands off affair - letting Russian's have a party and hoping they would get addicted to the better things in life. Today the cat-and-mouse looks dated and silly. Especially as we now know that British Intelligence was totally infiltrated by the KGB.Those looking for cheap thrills, fights or gizmo's will come away disappointed. In reality I have always thought that the spy game must be the most boring and frustrating job in the whole world. You are living a lie and in many cases you achieve nothing and even if you do your work goes unthanked. Who needs it? While only really a pot-boiler with a twist I recommend it to anybody who has had to live the life of doing things they don't really want to do and meeting people they don't want to meet. Like me, for example....

Am I being picky?Well,maybe,but for all Mr M.Caine's London Working Class Boy Looking rather like a grown up Mod performance is deserving of most of the praise it has got over the last forty - odd years,its smoke and mirrors cannot disguise the fact that his character - one step ahead of the Glasshouse - is not very believable.Much more so are messrs Greene and Doleman,a Charters and Caldicote for the swinging sixties or what passed for them amongst middle - ranking War Office civil servants. Mr N.Greene indulges himself somewhat in the much showier part as Major Dalby,every inch the off - duty guards officer,but back in 1965 most of the audience would have encountered someone just like him on a parade ground or an orderly room.Cynical of eye and tongue,rigid and unswerving he would stare out the most aggressive of drunken defaulters. Mr C.Doleman,all weary sophistication was the opposite side to the same coin.Understanding of human weakness without being tolerant of it,his type of officer puzzled NCOs and O.R.s throughout the army. Within the arcane infrastructure of the Civil Service these three very different men ostensibly work on the same task - the kidnapping of Brtish scientists and their disappearance behind the iron Curtain. But Mr Deighton's obsession with the British Class System (he was a bright working - class boy amidst the middle - classes)necessitates our Cockney hero having one over on his betters to an extent that can stretch credulity. I mean none of this to detract from the quality of the picture or the esteem I hold it in.Apart from The spy who came in from the cold thereis not a better exposition of Cold War Realpolitik in the cinema. And only Oskar Homolka as Col Stock in Mr Deighton's Billion Dollar Brain more exemplifies the pragmatic qualities of real espionage than Doleman and Greene. The Ipcress File marks the debut of Harry Palmer(unnamed in the novel,an anonymous hero presumably being a difficult concept for a movie).Not so much emphasis was placed on his proletarian antecedents in subsequent pictures,nor his culinary gifts,and he was consequently more believable,but presumably less popular because neither were successful. A pity because Billion Dollar Brain in particular is a very fine work by the much vilified Ken Russell. Mr M.Caine arguably never had a better role until Mr Huston cast him in The man who would be King. Watch this amazingly tight little film,marvel at his cool control and forget all those awful potboilers. Just as an aside....back in 1966,Sir Alf Ramsey took England's World Cup Squad to see The Ipcress File.Just as the titles rolled,the late Alan Ball piped up I've already seen this...XXXXXX done it!He was immediately set upon by his team mates,but made up for it by producing a World Cup winning performance a few days later.

Caine's appeal in IF (Ipcress File) is probably due to the stubborn anti-hero qualities he exudes, a ladies man with a a roving eye that would put a radar array to shame, suave, sophisticated, yet very much man about the house, given his self-supporting stance in the film.An ex-army sergeant ' bought ' from a military prison into active service in a different guise, the trade off being the job he's doing has the potential to kill him, so stark choice, spend time in prison or do this job and get 'pardoned' effectively, if you live to tell the tale.He exhibits in the film the ' I'm doing this my way ' attitude in several scenes, notably when he throws policy, procedure and protocol out of the window and asks for a high security clearance operation and gets it.The film is peppered with these events through to the end, had he been a matter of fact, by the book, typical spy, I doubt that the film would have worked so well, at the time, no other actor I feel would have filled the role of Harry Palmer so good as Caine. Given that it's now 40 years nearly since it was completed it's a classic in it's own right, and I feel always will be. The defining moment in Michael Caine's career which catapulted him to super stardom. One thing I have noticed is that when in the past Caine has been interviewed about films he's done he gives across that very same air of smarmy, I'm in control, I do this my way, and sod the lot of you, so I'm wondering how much ' real ' acting he needed to do in IF, it does seem that there was a lot of real Caine seeping out into the role.I haven't actually read the book yet, so if there's someone who can attest to how well placed the film is in reference to the original book of 1962, then I'd like you to put your findings as a post below mine. If you've never seen IF then please do, you won't regret it. It may not appeal to all, but then again what film does, for me it's my favourite and always will be. 9/10.

Unlike those celebrated Sean Connery vehicles, The Ipcress File does not present the life of a secret agent as a glamorous one. Michael Caine's character Harry Palmer is a short-sighted cynical spy who lives in a modest flat; he does his own shopping at his local super-market and doesn't bag-off with a succession of gorgeous women, he even has to do his own paper-work. He's pretty far removed from 007. The film itself has a strange look too. The cinematography is unusual in that events are often presented from behind foreground objects. It's quite an off-kilter approach and is agreeably unusual. There surely cannot be too many other films that show a fight from the vantage point of a phone box.Unlike the Bond films too, the film is entirely set in London. This of course reinforces the nuts and bolts presentation of spies, as opposed to the glamorous sun-kissed locales that Bond frequented on his travels. Even though I like the idea of coming at the spy-film with a new angle, I am not actually a huge fan of this film simply because the plot line just isn't very good. Where the presentation is original, the story is pretty unoriginal and at times downright questionable &#x96; for example, surely the secret service would do a hell of a lot more that lamely agree to pay a ransom to the men who kidnapped the missing professor? They seem just a little too impotent to be believable. By the end of the film I sort of felt a little underwhelmed to be honest. I hoped for a bit more but unfortunately the final scenes when Palmer is captured resort to typical Prisoner/Bond thrills; which sort of seems a shame as the initial premise suggested that this film would go somewhere else. So, overall, The Ipcress File is a weak plot wrapped in a nice overall idea.

The indications that we are watching the Secret Service at work are restricted to the skewed framing and 'keyhole' shots through lattice, bannisters and a magnificently edited trompe d'oeil through, indeed a keyhole.Consequently, drama is all in the subterfuge of the spy business. The obfuscated shots and John Barry's sinewy, cymbalon-based score reflects the claustrophobic drama which has little action - the first fight sequence is understated, rendered from a third-party perspective.Fine support in a strong ensemble goes right down to the excellent and thoroughly typical non-Moneypenny ('Alice') of Freda Bamford.

This movie tries to be different, by not using too much action or a true evil mastermind villain that tries to take over or destroy the world. It chooses a more realistic approach, which seems all the more silly when considering that the story is far from a likely one.Seemed that producer Harry Saltzman, who also produced multiple James Bond movies, until the mid-'70's, wanted to completely dominate the spy-genre in every form. It also explains why this movie uses many crew-members, who were also involved with making the James Bond movies; Composer John Barry, editor Peter R. Hunt, production designer Ken Adam, art director Peter Murton, the movie being shot at the Pinewood studios. They also had the intention to make this movie the beginning of a long running series of Harry Palmer movies. 4 later movies involving Caine playing the Palmer character followed but over the course of 30 years. So you can't really say it was a truly successful series of movies, at least no in the way they intended it to be.The story is confusing, with its many different character names and spy-terms and codes. However once you've figured the story out completely you'll note that its actually a rather weak and thin one, with also some bad dialog in it. They just tried to make it seem more difficult and complicated than it in fact really was.The story moves slow, which also doesn't make this the most interesting or exciting movie to watch. The movie starts to take more pace in its second halve but the movie at the same time then starts to become more ridicules and hard to take really serious.But really, the movie is still a good watch. It's a different and in a way also a quite experimental movie, which makes this all the more a good watch. Also the directing and acting makes this a good movie to watch.The innovative and experimental cinematography is from Otto Heller, who is fairly unknown but has made some great movies during his career. It's the kind of camera-work you would normally expect to see in an '70's movie.The characters are all as British as they can get, with their heavy accents and gentleman attitudes. Michael Caine once more plays a slick, 'bad-boy' kind of person who also is of course a real lady-killer. Caine was specialized in these sort of roles and one year later he played his ultimate lady-killer role in Alfie.Simply a good movie but a tad too confusing and ridicules in parts to consider it a real genre classic.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Can't figure it out!","Date":"9 November 2006","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" I don't know about this film.

You know a movie's in trouble when you find yourself listening to and laughing at music that is supposed to be dramatic instead of watching the film. Viewed today this is just an extended version of any 'Avengers' episode.

It shifts uncomfortably among well-paced, well-edited action scenes, lengthy discourse between bureaucrats, and sudden revelations that advance the plot but seem to come out of nowhere.The opening sequence, for example, is one of the best in the entire movie; it's done almost without dialogue, yet the viewer is never at a loss to know what's going on, and it ends with a real grabber that keeps one's interest high.  Then we switch to the famous scene of Michael Caine arising and making breakfast; not a bad change of pace through the credits, actually.Contrast this, however, to succeeding scenes inside the intelligence bureaucracy that move along with all the intensity of sap dripping from a tree.  Coupled with this are some startling lapses in logic.  For instance, the counter-intelligence boys think there's some major kidnapping and murder afoot.  They have a prime suspect in mind and even can find him if they wish.  So what's their reaction?  They politely inquire whether he might be good enough to accept a payoff to stop being such a baddie.While this is all eventually explained, what isn't explained is why the other characters accepted this so unquestioningly.  Perhaps it's teddibly British and all, but you'd have thought *someone* would raise his hand and say, Um, excuse me, um, guys -- if this fellow is such a threat to the Free World, shouldn't we -- just maybe, mind you -- do more than ask his permission to bribe him?While the bad guys are allowed, even encouraged, to run around freely, one becomes puzzled a bit later when Michael Caine's character worries that someone is trying to frame him for murder.  The only question this suggests is, Why are you worried about *that*?  Your superiors didn't seem to think much of it when other murderers were running around loose.  Maybe they'll even throw some money your way . . . .We've also got C.I.A. agents who are quite willing -- even eager -- to kill one of the British agents to avenge an American agent accidentally killed by the British.  This isn't a rogue agent, either; it's more or less portrayed as business as usual.  Perhaps the question is impertinent, but weren't the Americans and British generally on the same side during the Cold War?On the other hand, there are some items tossed in without the slightest logical connection to what's gone before.  Gordon Jackson's character, for example, finds an important clue -- the possible meaning of the titular ipcress -- but he apparently figures it out because the screenwriter called him and told him.  His discovery certainly isn't based on anything that anyone's done up until that point.This isn't to say that this movie is a waste of time; Caine is always an interesting actor to watch, especially so early in his career.  The movie does engender some genuine suspense, and once the plot gets to the final third (through methods contrived or not), the payoff is worthwhile.  It's not even surprising that the visual style of this movie inspired the television version of MissionImpossible, although the creators of Mission soon learned to do it much, much better. (In fact, there are some interesting parallels between the *movie* version with Tom Cruise -- from railway intrigues to the presence of a mole -- though one can at least say of The Ipcress File that, thank God, it has a plot.)But if you're looking for the best spy movie of all time -- better look to John Le Carre or elsewhere.  This film's best moments, its strong sense of place and time, and its cast make it worthwhile, but its inconsistent pacing, lapses in logic, and reliance on plot contrivance, place it in the second tier of espionage movies. "},{"Title":"Although I'm surprised to say so, file it under miss-fire.","Date":"21 September 2008","Score":"1 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" The Ipcress File nowadays comes across as a bit of a reaction; a knee jerk reaction to something that was whipping the British film industry into a storm back in the day. A few James Bond films had been made starring then (and now, I suppose) icon Sean Connery. Enter The Ipcress File and everyday, likable Englishman Michael Caine with his studio's attempt to cash in on the craze in genre, either that or they didn't like Bond not being English and tried to make an alternative for other would-be fans. I may not have been around back in the day but judging from a few documentaries I've seen over the years as well as those still images of people queuing around the block to see Goldfinger, The Ipcress File was an attempt to cash in on this new secret agent genre. It was clearly popular.Sadly, viewing the film now as an individual piece and nothing more connected with anything else, it comes across as dead air; a splash in film history's ocean. The Ipcress File begins with something the Bond films also began with an opening action sequence or large scale event that connects the rest of the film, in this case it's the death of some kind of scientist (we can tell because of the magazine he's reading). Then comes the agent himself, our protagonist for the film Harry Palmer, as an early Michael Caine role. The thing here is The Ipcress File borders on the parody; not having Palmer already on some secret mission or in an exotic location or with a woman creates realism for his character and makes the character of Bond and his actions broad. Palmer wakes up; gets up; switches off the alarm clock and makes coffee &#150; a far cry from most Bond introductions which would go on to involve explosions, girls and the rest for its mere introduction.But any good to come out of The Ipcress File pretty much stops here and it sort of sends out the wrong message in the first place. I got a counter-balancing feeling when watching the film, a film that begins with a clear statement of emphasis on realism but will fall into the espionage genre anyway; a film with secret agents but will go about things low-key and somewhat mute. Is it possible to approach the vast and, above all, exciting subjects like espionage and secret agents in a low-key and mute fashion? Probably, but will it be as interesting? Going by how The Ipcress File turned out, 'not really' is the answer.The Ipcress File follows on from its lead character introduction by giving us Palmer's place of work, an office. But again it's having a swipe at Bond. This isn't some fancy, exquisite office with pretty walls; houseplants and posh wooden furniture, oh-no, this is a drab and dreary office with colourless walls and people with real names instead of 'Moneypenny' and 'M'.So we get the idea The Ipcress File is trying to humanise a caricature; a caricature that exists within genres associated with escapism but if anything, it grates after a while. The trouble with The Ipcress File is its dull and unimaginative look, feel and general story twinned with the distinct lack of conflict. Rather than follow what most detective stories do by progressing the narrative with a clue in a scene in a causality driven style, The Ipcress File has its hero organise botched raids; it has its hero distracted by an American agent who appears just as quickly as he disappears before changing its tack completely and turning into something that has our hero look as if he's being framed.In The Ipcress File, everybody dresses the same; everybody looks the same and everybody talks the same, frequently in an annoying coded manner that frustrates more than it does get anything done. Caine as an actor cannot deliver an interesting performance because the character of Palmer is so flat and uninteresting bar the 'break away' ideation (in which credit goes to the screenwriter) that it's often painful to watch. Palmer spends his time organising botched raids; sleeping around and spends too much time in the office although he is conveniently placed just when the script needs a 'Eureka' moment. There is a scene that captures the monotony The Ipcress File slips into in a public park, at a bandstand, Palmer and another individual sit watching a brass band but when an important conversation arises, it is the other individual that delivers all the necessary dialogue as things progress. Palmer can only sit and remain passive as things are done.This scene sums things up for me; the lead character is relegated to staying in the background as matters are either taken care of or presented, much like the break away secret agent image ideation. I want to see Palmer away from the suits and offices, solving the mystery and cracking the case and it doesn't help later on when the bad guys cannot decide on whether they want him dead thanks to shooting the driver of his car or alive for the hypnosis torture they eventually put him through any way. Confused logic something this film has far too much of to make it just about watchable. "}{"Title":"Boring!","Date":"23 February 2006","Score":"2 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" This film takes about one hour and a half to tell the audience what it is all about, and when the audience finally seizes the plot it is so disappointed with the laughable ending that it can only come to one conclusion Harry Palmer is as boring as his name suggests. He is nothing but a boring spook with glasses that make him look aristocratic. I'd rather watch an ordinary James Bond flick than this wannabe independent spy movie. I really can see how the director thought I wanna make a spy movie that is different from the James Bond movies, so what I'll do (oh, I am a genius) is this I'll make Miss Moneypenny an old lady that smokes, I'll turn James Bond into a cooking and music-loving intellectual and I develop a story around this hypnotizing story which is so great... (director raves on). No, no, no, this is not a good film There is nothing to it and I was really disappointed, because the cover on the DVD looked interesting, and I thought I was about to see a great film Guess I have to keep on searching These days it is easier to find a needle in a stack of hay than it is to find a good movie.
