I absolutely love this movie.  It is complex, and extremely accurate in its portrayal of the time when gangsters owned stars.  If you love jazz music and know a little about its history, you will be enraptured by this movie.The acting is incredible, and highlights the subtle twists in the plot beautifully.  The cinematography is done in a most expert fashion.  Richard Gere and Gregory Hines are absolutely charming, and Diane Lane is perfect is Vera Cicero.  Lonette McKee has one of the most beautiful voices you will ever hear, it is no wonder she received a Tony award.  Any viewer will be surprised by the guest appearances including Nicholas Cage, Bob Hoskins, Lawrence Fishburne, and on-screen and real-life brother of Gregory, Maurice Hines. Not only one of Coppola's best, but one of the best of all time.

Was it because of the murder case surrounding its production?  Or did some people feel that a mixture of gangster films and Hollywood musicals didn't mix?  Whatever the reason, The Cotton Club deserves to be watched again and again, not just for its music and dancing, but for the great performances, scenery, cars, costumes...and tommy-guns.  The movie was nominated for two Oscars, but a third nomination should have gone to Bob Hoskins, for his brilliant performance as Owney Madden.  Despite his few film credits, James Remar is brilliant as Dutch Schultz and comes across as the sort of person you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley.There are rumours the film may be re-released with scenes and music that were cut from the original version.  If this is true, would the film finally become a hit?  After all, Robert Evans, the film's producer, apparently told one reporter...How can it miss?  It's got gangsters, music and girls.  Well said, Robert.

Now years later while I have the luxury of sitting in my house watching the various showings on cable, I like a better. Why because this movie is IMO 3 different movies going on at once. I Now I am able to concentrate on one aspect of the movie more then the whole. I will start with movie #1... The Cotton club, the nightclub where everything converges and what is the common denominator that brings ALL of the characters together. It is almost set up like a Plantation in Mississippi. The white gangster own the place and the black people work there and have no say about anything that goes on. Black people were not even able to go to the club as a customer. All of the women who worked there were light skin almost passing for white. In the movie they do show how the set up was but the place was no as large as it was in the movie and on a side bar. Larry Fishburn who plays a numbers runner (the same role he played in a later movie, Hoodlum) shows interest in a brown skin singer performer in the club and her mother is very upset because she is the first dark skin woman working at the club. I liked that they added that in. I know this because my neighbor use to play with Louis Armstrong that the women in question is in fact Louis Amstrongs future wife. A little tidbit. I like the music and the performances which took place in the club. To me this was the most enjoying part of the movie. I feel a movie just about the Club without all the other foolishness it would be very interesting in the right hands. Which brings me to movie 2THe gangsters or the white people. Owey Madden was a thug and a very nasty man. In this movie Bob Hoskin (who was very good) and Fred Gwynn who I loved played like they were Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. In the right hands we would of seen the real Madden. Remember this is the man who kept black people out of his club. And did battle with other NY gangsters. Then we have Dutch Schultz. I wonder why we did not see more of Lucky Luciano because it was those 2 who were causing havoc in NYC during the 20's with Luciano winning. I think James Remer did the best portrayal of Schulz. Years later Tim Roth played him in the movie Hoodlum and he was good, but Remer was scarier. And according to all reports he was a psychopath. Then we have the George Raft(Dixie Dwyer) character played by Richard Gere If people are not familiar with the actor George Raft it was known he hung around the mob and had big time mob connections..who actually got him a job in movies. Richard Gere even mentions at one time that he use to be a dancer. I am sure that is reference and acknowledgment of George Raft, who was a dancer before he went to Hollywood. George Raft was actually a pretty good actor. Gere even looks like him. I feel that is the real reason they cast him in this movie. Look at this movie as Gere playing Raft and not playing Dixie Dwyer and the part works. The last movie is the Harlem story. The Larry Fishburne character was a real person. He was lifetime criminal who spent most of his life in jail. He was not the voice of righteousness we see in the movie or the movie Hoodlum. What was interesting was the scene when he and the woman who was running the numbers racket in Harlem were offered a deal. I like they put that in the movie, that was true. The woman who was the real boss of the numbers racket came from the West Indies and started the whole thing on her own. A very tough cookie who went to jail because she would not give in to the mob. The mob was politically connected and they put her in jail for a long time. I like the the Hines bothers in the movie. They were feuding in real life and this movie was a way they starting talking again. They actually showed that in the movie. ALso the Vonnetta McGee character was interesting. I am a very light skin black women who could pas for white. WhICH I WOULD NEVER DO. But I don't know about living back in the early part of the century. The scene when she and Sandman goes to the hotel and the clerk tries to deny them a room actually happened to me and a boyfriend of mine years ago. So that scene really hit me. I would of liked if they explored Harlem life more, but the movie had too much going on already.Nicholas Cage...nephew of Cappolla was good playing the violent brother of the Richard Gere character. I would like to have seen him in more parts like that instead of the garbage he has been wasting himself in the last few years. Diane Lane was the miscast. She was playing a real character too, but she came nowhere near the woman she was playing, Texas Guinon(I think that was her last name) A big boozy tough blonde. To me that is the major miscast of the movie. I like her though, but not in this movie. This is a movie I feel has to be seen around 5 times to get the whole feeling of it. A good movie but just too messy and too much.

Richard Gere plays Dixie Dwyer, a young musician who works for mobsters, in an effort to advance his career. Dwyer falls in love with Vera Cicero (Diane Lane), the girlfriend of gangster Dutch Schultz (James Remar). The Dwyer character is based loosely on real-life jazz trumpet player Bix Beiderbecke.Throughout the film, various gangsters and bootleggers interact, sometimes violently, but much of the action centers around the Cotton Club, an establishment owned in real-life by Owney Madden, played in the film by actor Bob Hoskins. Madden would bring in Black performers to entertain a Whites-only client√®le, a truly racist policy, and a major plot point in the film's story.The film's plot is somewhat muddled, the result of a less than stellar screenplay. And, as you would expect, the gangster characters are not terribly likable. But the film overcomes these script weaknesses with a captivating visual and musical style that is both tawdry and elegant. The corruption, the violence, and the implied sleaze are garish and tawdry to be sure. Yet, the Club's ambiance gushes with a certain elegance and glamour. It's a strange mix, but one that is entirely consistent with that era in U.S. history.The film gets points from me for its lush, period piece costumes and production design, and adroit lighting, as well as all those jazz numbers, both sultry and flashy. Gregory Hines together with brother Maurice Hines provide some snappy tap dancing, some of which is improvised. Interestingly, their grandmother really did perform at the Cotton Club during its heyday. Also of interest in the film, viewers get to watch towering Fred Gwynne, who plays Frenchy, the oh-so-serious assistant to Owney Madden; the two of them engage in some interesting dialogue.Although the script's story and characters are less than ideal, I enjoyed the film a lot, mostly as a result of the tawdry and elegant visual style combined with the lavish jazz numbers. If you're interested in gangster movies or the Prohibition era of American history, this film is a must-see.

Check out the haunting Creole Love Call. I had hoped that a fuller, uncensored version would have surfaced by now.... especially on dvd. For instance, when Shultz kills Flynn in the dining room we see him stick a skewer in his neck. Yet 2 seconds later there is blood on the walls, dripping from the chandelier, and over just about everybody in the room. Sure looks like we missed something. This film could have been a lot better but for what it is, it's still worth a look. Bob Hoskins and a very menacing Fred Gwynne excel. Recommended.

The actors often play too broad (Diane Lane), and Richard Gere shows his lazy, grinning acting here too. However, many notable smaller roles for Gregory Hines (and his brother), Bob Hoskins, Laurence Fishburne and others who make it well worth watching. It is true that $40 million could have been used better, but when you consider both Bob Evans and Coppola's involvement it seems with hindsight that they were asking for trouble.  The music deserves special credit, as do the tap sequences (which i gather were shortened and some cut - what a shame). Mostly Duke Ellington classics.

Maybe one day you'll wise up, sap","Date":"8 May 2009","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Music","Review":" One gets the sense that 'The Cotton Club (1984)' will improve upon repeat viewings, once you've become accustomed to what director Francis Ford Coppola was attempting. After all, this is a gangster film from the man who brought us 'The Godfather (1972)' and its sequels &#x96; what else could we expect but another Corleone saga? The film we're delivered is nothing of the sort, a testament to the director's constant willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas. Indeed, rather than trying to emulate Coppola's former successes, 'The Cotton Club' could more accurately be described as a gangster musical, a realisation that took me until the film's second half. Do those two genres even go together? Perhaps taking inspiration from Herbert Ross' 'Pennies from Heaven (1981)' &#x96; and the mini-series on which it was based &#x96; the film blends the ugly brutality and corruption of the Prohibition- era with the dazzling bright lights of the Cotton Club, Harlem's premiere night club. It is this deliberate but uneasy juxtaposition of reality and fantasy that fuels Coppola's vision, an ambitious undertaking without a dominant focus.The film's major storyline concerns Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere), a comparatively ordinary jazz musician who unexpectedly finds himself associating with organised crime boss Dutch Schultz (James Remar). Dixie is interesting because, unlike your typical hero consumed by the allure of amoral riches, he always remains peripheral to the world of gangsters; he observes, with disapproval, its dishonesty and depravity, but rarely finds himself a part of it. In fact, the closest he ever comes to being a gangster is in Hollywood, where he shares the sort of film roles that made James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson famous. Coppola might have been offering a commentary on the inherently romanticised version of reality offered by the movies, but his real world of gangsters is scarcely less stylised. The seedy underbelly of organised crime is paradoxically depicted as taking place in the classiest locales in Harlem, where the crime bosses consume the best alcohol and mix with Hollywood's elite talent (Chaplin, Swanson and Cagney among the featured patrons). Proving further that Coppola wasn't attempting to replicate his Corleone saga, 'The Cotton Club' also features a rather extraneous subplot with Maurice and Gregory Hines as African-American tap-dancers vying for the big-time at the Cotton Club, where (in a bizarre discriminatory switch) only black performers are hired. The regular cross-cutting between this story and Dixie Dwyer's doesn't quite work, and, in any case, the taut romance between Dwyer and tough-girl Vera (an absolutely gorgeous Diane Lane) is much more involving than that between Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines) and mixed-race dancer Lila (Lonette McKee). Among the film's impressive supporting performers are Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne as crime associates, Nicholas Cage as an overly-ambitious young thug, Laurence Fishburne as black crime boss Bumpy Rhodes, and James Remar, playing a sleazier and less identifiable version of Dutch Schultz to Dustin Hoffman in 'Billy Bathgate (1991).' The premiere gangster film of 1984 was Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America (1984),' but, despite being runner-up, nobody can accuse Coppola of playing it safe.

Raised too high by initial expectations, then dismissed too brusquely when the critics got to see it, The Cotton Club exists in a kind of neutral zone, a grand spectacle undone by sloppy scriptwriting and unappealing characters that nevertheless shows the master with some juice still in his cup.It's the story of Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere), a cornet player who one evening in 1928 almost accidentally saves the life of notorious mob boss Dutch Schultz (James Remar). Dutch, already a fan of his music, is appreciative of the extra service and brings Dwyer into his circle, which brings him into contact with Dutch's girl Vera (Diane Lane).If I didn't like you, you'd be dead, is Dutch's way of expressing friendship.It's nice to be liked, Dixie replies.The film is centered around the nightclub of the title, a fashionable Harlem nightspot where blacks are welcome only on stage, entertaining the white customers. Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins) runs things with an eye for keeping order, especially where the volatile Dutchman is concerned. Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines) just wants to dance into the arms of Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), who is torn between the chance for true love versus the chance to pass for white in a white man's world.The stacked cast even includes Nicolas Cage as Dixie's mad-dog gangster brother and Laurence Fishburne in one of his first signature tough-guy roles. The white man has left me nothing but the underworld, and that is where I dance, he tells Sandman. Where do you dance? All this crammed into just over two hours leaves very little room to breathe, for a director who mastered movies which do exactly that. But with little useful dialogue except of the expository kind, characters coming and going all the time, left-field plot twists (Dixie goes to Hollywood and becomes an instant star), and a central romance between Gere and Lane that is long on open-mouth kissing but short on story, you need spectacle to keep your attention.Remar makes the film worthwhile for me. His bug-eyed tantrums as Dutch are what stay with me when the film is over, yet he shows range, too, shy with Vera, henpecked with his wife, and amiable with Dixie in his guarded way. It's hard not to worry what will happen when he learns about Dixie and Vera, not only for the lovebirds but for Dutch, too. I only wish Remar could have played Dutch in the latter film set in the same milieu, Billy Bathgate; Dustin Hoffman is a great actor but was wrong for that part. Remar here fits into it like a cement overshoe.The film also boasts great music, including singing from McKee and tapping from Hines and his brother Maurice that raise the roof and recall the famous baptism scene in Coppola's first Godfather. Larry Marshall does a great Cab Calloway, conked locks whipping across his forehead.Nothing is really wrong with Cotton Club. But what's right doesn't stay right for long, and the rest doesn't hold together. It's a fun show, so long as you don't mind being a bit confused when the curtain comes down.

But Francis Ford Coppola is not any director, so The Cotton Club is not just any movie. Rather, it succeeds at practically all levels and is certainly a film worth coming back to again and again.Set in Harlem in the late 1920s, we are introduced to a group of Jazz Age-products, people who see themselves exactly as they are but all hope to go somewhere better. Two story lines occupy the plot; we get a good-looking young musician Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere) who gets involved in the mob after falling for one of the gangster's girlfriends (Diane Lane) and we get the story of a very talented black dancer (Gregory Hines) trying to prove his love to a half-black and half-white chorus girl who seems to struggle with her place in this more or less racist society. Almost every night, everyone gathers at The Cotton Club, one of the most famous clubs in the city and the blacks entertain while the whites drink and watch. But Coppola gives us a view from all angles so it doesn't feel as if we are missing anything important.One of the biggest achievements of this film is its staging of the dance sequences, which are to say the least quite exquisite. Filled with colorful costumes and some mind-boggling tap numbers, at times you may forget that this is also a gangster picture. Indeed, some scenes feel just like Coppola's The Godfather with its quick bursts of violence but also in its tone of sad, elegiac setting. People come and go and some regret the things they do, but the music lives on. The acting is also very strong as Gere and Lane are quite wonderful in their first of three films together. Both were very good-looking and they do bring out the best in each other. Two supporting actors that really do steal the show are Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne as a mob boss and his head bodyguard. They share a tenacity and ferociousness in their dealings, but also have one really terrific scene involving Gwynne coming to see Hoskins after being kidnapped. A young Nicolas Cage also shows here he had incredible potential.This Broadway version of the gangster film so familiar in Hollywood refreshes both genres as we see the similarities between the two. Indeed, many of the participators in the entertainment were also involved in the mob and Coppola shows how the two lives intertwine and bring a lot of trouble to everyone. This may seem as a strange mixing of genres and story lines for some people, but it is well worth the two hours. It is funny, sad, violent, poetic but also enormously entertaining and isn't that what the movies are all about? Coppola seems to think so.

The picture always holds up. The combination of story, music and characters is as solid know as when it originally debuted. Because of the problems with the production, especially the problems that Robert Evans the producer was having, the picture was basically dumped, and disappeared. Everyone attached to it seemed to disown it, which is too bad, since it ranks as good as anything Francis Ford Coppola has ever done -- and he has done a lot of the greatest cinema ever made. Most, if not all of Cotton Club was done on sound stages, but Coppola makes the whole thing believable and he ties several stories together at once Richard Gere and Diane Lane; and Gregory Hines and Lonette McKee. With the great music, the original stuff by Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington etc., neatly held together with new stuff by John Barry, The Cotton Club is a genuine musical, that, for my money, is more effective than Chicago, that Gere would star in more than 20 years later. If you have the chance, catch The Cotton Club on DVD or on cable. You will not be disappointed, and, if you are like me, you will rank this film as a worthy cousin to Mr. Coppola's masterworks, The Godfather I & II, and The Conversation.

Desptie it being over-budget and under-whelming at the box-office, what remains is probably one of the director's most provocative turns, with so much thrust into it that one ends up admiring the whole so much that it can be forgiven that it veers into the bulky side of things. It's near-classic pulp melodrama fused with the grace and intelligence of the Hollywood musicals and crime pictures of the period that would come shortly after the events in this film. It's also at times utterly pleasurable as conventional fare that knows what it is, as well as visually flourishing in cinematography and editing to go a little further with the material. It's risky stuff not because of the story in and of itself, but because of the chances Coppola takes with putting so much together. Unlike one of his contemporaries, Scorsese, and his film New York, New York, the Cotton Club even in its most dragging or trickiest points in the narrative reigns high as an original hybrid by giving something captivating on every side of the coin.Acting-wise, Coppola goes for the big ensemble once again (a trademark of his films in the 80s), with the key ones allowing for the director to put a lot into each smaller group. The stars as the drenched-in-formula good looking' musician-cum-actor (Richard Gere) and the girl on the side for one of the big mob bosses in New York City (Diane Lane). the gangsters, all with specific characteristics that gain momentum as the story goes, like Dutch Schultz (James Remar) as the possessive paranoid killer, Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne (what a combo) as certain 'business interests' entwined with the rest of the mob, and Nicolas Cage as Gere's younger brother, a hot-head racist who wants to take over; the black actors, singers, dancers, all right out of Harlem and with its own stars (Gregory Hines, in one of his very best performances/roles), and criminals (Fishburne as a key part of this group). And the club itself is something of a character- as principle location- unto itself, as some surreal bastion of escapist glee (if your part of the audience) and gangland violence and bad race vibes (if not). Coppola also has the occasional side character, like the MC at the club played by Tom Waits (made believable all by a cigar), to not make either side too top-heavy.Whether one side bests the other or not is arguable. It's hard to say that there aren't some noteworthy scenes in practically every turn, even if they tend to go over-the-top (like Remar with Schultz) or almost too much on young charisma (Lane and sometimes Gere). It's a credit to Coppola, at least on that front, that he corrals moments- like the break-up/reuniting with Sandman and Clay Williams, or between the two main stars when they're literally between white sheets backstage at the club- that add up to a lot in the grand scheme of things. His other main concerns, however, are music and the subtle presence of the camera. There's rarely a dull moment with the former, as Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway are presented, if only for fans, as legends unto themselves that even get fleeting glances on screen (the Calloway number Minnie the Moocher is a hight-light). And Coppola's tie-in with Stephen Goldblatt and his editors is crucial, albeit using each to their fullest extent depending on the mood. The film moves pretty fast, narratively quicker than the Godfather films, but he only uses montage for pivotal cross-cutting moments, showing the rise and fall of the gangsters with that of the club gaining prestige (the fall, in the big climax, is as magnificent as it can get in cinema), and the technical prowess is skillful and inventive.And all the same, it shouldn't all work entirely, because so much feels like it's about to explode at any moment, and nearly to a point where it edges on the point of being the same thing that Coppola is striving to homage (shallow, escapist sensationalism). There's parallels between the struggles of musicians, criminals, and the others on the sidelines in show-business, and are exploited quite well. All the same it ends up not exactly a 'great' movie, because the underlying ideas for something much deeper only work up to a point. Still, after a first viewing, and like with most other films from the director (and, damned if I say it, the producer too), I wouldn't pass it up again on a viewing late at night; it's one of the more shamelessly entertaining pictures of the mid 80s.

Prohibition and the depression fill the air just as the talkie movie bursts out of the silver screen. The Cotton Club of the title is the focal point for many of the key character's lives, so Francis Coppola, who stepped in at the eleventh hour of the troubled production, has many threads to juggle. He drops the odd one, but never to the detriment of the verve and swagger of the pic. Violence comes and goes, song and dance often dazzles the eyes and ears, and a cast of hundreds induces that good old game of spot the stars - past, present and future.The narrative has strength via the observations of a major part of America in great transition, with the art design ops and tech crew beavers aiding him considerably via some superb period flavourings There is no getting away from the slightness of some character strands, the director and co choosing to insert another, all be it delightful, dance or song number to fill the void, but the core of the story remains strong throughout.

Gangs of one sort or another tried their best to run, dominate or at least influence the bustling town. This enjoyable film is from a novel written by Jim Haskins and credits' Francis ford Coppola of 'The Godfather' fame as screenwriter and Director. Although, the basic story revolves around the power of Major Gangsters like Dutch Schultz (James Remar, Superior acting), Ellsworth 'Bumpy Rhodes (Laurence Fishburburne) 'Lucky Luciano (Dalles Andro) Vincent 'Mad Dog' Coll (Nicolas Cage) and his brother, Dixie Dwyer, (Richard Gere), the inner story is of the famous Harlem night spot, called The Cotton Club. Assembling the two timely ingredients together, Directer Francis Coppola blends a cavalcade of famous and infamous Hollywood Stars with historical events. The result is a fascinating, excursion through the Jazz age, complete with colorful dance routines, Tap dancing duos and orchestral classics such as Cab Calloways' (Larry Marshals) 'Minnie the Moocher.' In addition, two love stories flow neatly in between dance numbers and Machine gun bursts. Gregory Hines, Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne enhance the magical rhythm of this incredible journey into yester-year.

It's a stirring, jarring ensemble piece where Dutch Schultz and Lucky Luciano stand side by side with fictional but realistic characters in a kind of side door universe. A strange yet focused glimpse into the hypocrisy and violence of the early 20th century.Obviously it's a Coppala film and shows the technical brilliance of FFC's well used brain.It's like an alternate take on Godfather 2, a different version where we focus on the smaller, less organized criminals. The cast is capable and seem to genuinely enjoy their roles. Gregory Hines showcases both his dancing brilliance as well as his acting chops, playing a man caught between mainstream fame and backstreet love. Richard Gere's tormented wannabe feels genuine while a very young Diane Lane and not yet famous Nicholas Cage pull off pretty admirable performances of their own.But the film's ensemble strength is also it's weakness, it goes off in too many directions, never quite settling on one narrative to make you fully give a damn. Sure it's nice to see what's going on in every single character's life but honestly the film would benefit from a little less detail just to let the plot breath. Lucky Luciano's presence at the tale end felt more like a Deus Ex Machina. All of a sudden the greatest gangster in New York history walks in and solves the problem? Really?All in all, good but not great.

Apocalypse Now soon follows. Maybe you remember The Outsiders, Peggy Sue Got Married, or even Tucker- A Man and His Dream. But everyone forgets The Cotton Club. This is a pity, because from the astonishing level of period accuracy to the actual technical skills that went into the film, it is evidence of Coppola's cinematic skill and his genius for all aspects of the movie-making process, even if it falls short of being his best. Coppola, as in The Godfather, shows a stunning talent for casting the right person for a given part, and a better cast film than this would be difficult to find. Even Joe Dallesandro as Charlie Luciano is the best portrayal of Lucky ever put on film, although the physical resemblance is totally non-existent. The period accuracy, including the sets, the costumes, the props, even the dialogue, is fantastic, and the only equal I've ever seen is Warren Beatty's Bugsy. The highlights of the film- -The cinematography, especially the hauntingly beautiful lighting (with copious use of classic cookie screens) in the love scene with Dixie and Vera. -The Felliniesque finish, with action and reaction from Penn Station to The Cotton Club and back cross-cutting and inter-mingling. - The Second Unit and montage sequences, directed by Coppola's Son, the late Gian-Carlo Coppola. The montage sequences alone are a fantastic example of what a fantastic diamond in the rough Gio was and what a fabulous director he may have turned out to be (eclipsing his sister, Sofia, and even his Father) had his life not been cut short so tragically.

At times it succeeds. At other times it falls way short of the mark.What I really admire is the fact that it deals with racial and ethnic friction honestly. The racial slurs in the dialog were part of the reality of that time. Relations between blacks and whites are not idealized. Richard Gere and Gregory Hines are neighbors and acquaintances, but are not portrayed as close friends. When Gregory Hines prevents Dutch Schultz (James Remar in a vivid characterization) from killing Richard Gere, he does it out of basic decency. Mercifully, there are none of the sentimental relationships between blacks and whites that seem so patently false in other films.Gangland New York during the prohibition era has rarely been portrayed accurately. A worst case example was a 1991 disaster called Mobsters (a.k.a. Young Tommy Guns). The Cotton Club deals with real life chracters like Owney Madden (has he ever been portrayed in another film under his real name?), Big Frenchy DeMange, Arthur Dutch Schultz Flegenheimer, a Vincent Coll standin, Charlie Lucky Luciano, Trigger Mike Coppola, and (at least in an early shooting script) Jack Legs Diamond. Richard Gere's character was loosely based on George Raft.They were fascinating characters. At times, The Cotton Club tries to play fair with them. It almost succeeds.On the whole, this should have been a better film. Personally, I would have preferred a film that focused on the real life gangsters with the music simply as background. The attempt to elevate the black characters to a position of equal importance in the narrative is the flaw that undoes the film. It's difficult to follow characters who have no power and little chance of gaining it. Obviously, that is not politically correct. However, I prefer for historical films to deal with life the way it really was, rather than the way some people think that it should have been.All in all, an interesting and honorable failure.

Among them are would be gangster Dixie Dwyer (a slick Richard Gere), Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines), a young Bumpy Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) and renowned psychopathic mobster Dutch Schultz (a ferocious James Remar). Coppola wisely ducks a routine plot line in favor of a helter skelter, raucous cascade of delirious partying, violence and steamy romance, a stylistic choice almost reminiscent of Robert Altman. Characters come and go, fight and feud, drink and dance and generally keep up the kind of manic energy and pizazz that only the 20's could sustain.

Ryan, James Russo, Fred Gwynne, Allen Garfield, Ed O Ross, Diane Venora, Woody Strode, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Cobbs, Sofia Coppola and singer Tom Waits as Irving Stark, the club's owner.

We simply spend too much time on their pants and skirts and who is or isn't going to blaze on the other. It turned off both audiences, my crowd gangster fans and the musical jazz people who loved the music and dancing. One of the paradoxes of the Other Directed Society is this block-headed thumbs up or down. Remar is worth owning the movie for, look, I like Hoffman but his Schultz, in Billy Bathgate, was just terrible. Remar will really stun you how menacing he is here conveying perfectly the sociopathic Dutch Schultz. In one horrifying sequence, at a food table, he grabs a butcher's knife and stabs a rival gangster; he is shaking, drenched in blood, Madden almost kills him on the spot; Frenchy holds a gun on him and you can tell Madden is thinking it over. This is my favorite part of the movie, Coppola knew how to do organized crime; when the movie focuses upon the Cotton Club, Madden, Luciano, Schultz it shines brightly. Trust me, I read lots of books on the Mafia, being part Italian, this is the best depiction of Dutch Schultz in any movie. It is approached by Roth in Hoodlum, I simply hated the rest of that movie. Also, while Roth conveys his coldness, there is not quite the volcanic murderous outbursts Remar does so well here. The musical parts are spectacular with the late Hines and his brother doing fantastic tap dancing; there is a great reunification of the two estranged brothers near the end that is so well done. What kills the movie is the romance, which should have been tangential, is center stage. Yes, they are good looking people but neither one could ever act one scene. Coppola gets wooden readings out of both of them, for me, the rest of the movie is good enough to overcome this flaw. Please, look at the supporting cast Hoskins, Cage, Gwynne, Garfield, Fishburne, even old reliable John P. Ryan. If you are going to watch this, ask yourself what kind of movie you are expecting? The romance is dreadful, stilted and boring; the gangster and music parts are a nine star movie. Admittedly, often when you get wrapped up in the music or gangster parts, off on a tangent we go with Dixie and Vera. The core of the movie for me is Madden, Dutch with Vincent flying off the handle and creating a crisis which brings about the eventual demise of Dutch at Luciano's hands. The etiology of Dutch's demise here is completely specious; in reality, Dewey was about to indict Dutch and he had the stupidity to tell Lucky he planned on shooting all thirty five witnesses to his maleficence. This is why Lucky killed him, no ripples in the water for the organization.As a reviewer, this is as pithy as I can distill it, a first rate gangster and Cotton Club musical interpolated with some cringe worthy badly acted romantic scenes. These are few enough that I have always overlooked them, the rest is so good. I cannot emphasize how well done the music and dance numbers are, you feel like you are there. Hine's romance actually was done much better than Dixie and Vera. If you are a pure romance viewer, going into this, it will really annoy you for the romance is quite background here. You will resent and be bored by the music and gangster main thrust of Francis Ford Coppola. I never expect perfection from any movie, the good parts in this are redemptive enough for me to tolerate parts I dislike. The Vincent part with Frenchy's kidnapping and Madden's reuniting with him is endearing enough, alone, to own this old underrated classic. The gangster story being my favorite, for the musical part to be appreciated by someone who does not like Jazz tells you how good it is. I can tell you this, you will never see a better delineation of Dutch Schultz, Remar nails him. The volcanic, violent psycho he was is right there, what a piece of acting. An Underrated Movie. Q.E.D.

The script isn't nearly as tight, and the all-star cast, despite being mostly good, isn't anywhere near as good as the Godfather ensemble. Personally, I'd take it over at least the third Godfather film any day of the week (that one was nominated for Best Picture; this film must have had similar aspirations, getting released near Christmas of 1984, but it only garnered two noms, for art direction and editing). The film is kind of Altman-esque with the way it follows multiple story lines (my first thought was I wonder what Altman could have done with it? but then I remember his own film of a similar vein, Kansas City, was a dud). None of them are particularly fantastic, truth be told, but all are serviceable. Richard Gere is the closest thing we have to a protagonist, as a cornet player who becomes a right-hand man to a gangster (James Remar). Diane Lane becomes romantically entangled with the both of them, but ends up with the gangster. Another plot line follows dancer Gregory Hines' romantic pursuit of the light skinned singer Lonette McKee. Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne play gangsters who co-own the Cotton Club. Nicolas Cage plays Gere's brother, who also becomes a gangster. The real worth of the film, though, is just the wonderful milieu and the awesome musical and dance numbers. Near the end of the film, Cab Calloway becomes the Cotton Club's premier musical talent (he's played by Larry Marshall). Perhaps this isn't great, but it's definitely worthwhile.

If you ignore that sort of minor flaw, you still get a splashy mob flick that is highly stylized, highly energized, and done with mounds of real panache.Taking place in 1930's Harlem (ah the good old days) and projecting itself as a movie that tries to cram in 2-3 stories in a 2 hr. period, Club tells the tale (or tales) of musician Dixie Dwyer, (played by Richard Gere who has amazing screen presence here) his uncontrollable resistance to move up the mob chain, and the resorting-to-murder brother he has to look out for (played with gusto by Nicolas Cage). The film also examines the life of a racially discriminated tap dancer (Gregory Hines) who struts his stuff at where else, The Cotton Club.Projecting itself as a sped up version of Coppola's masterpiece The Godfather (there's a sequence toward the end that pays complete homage to the baptism murder scene in said movie), this torrid vehicle has a fantastic look (very accurate for the time period and not too overdone), brilliant acting by Richard Gere ( Dwyer) and Nicolas Cage ( Dwyer's brother Vincent), and well choreographed, exhilarating tap dance sequences.Coppola, who is in total command of the camera (and his craft) wants to make sure the viewer is worn out by the time the credits roll. He is accurate, doesn't give an inch (he's a perfectionist. All you gotta do is watch the Heart of Darkness documentary), but seems too busy filling the screen with an overload of indelible images. I guess he insists on doing this instead of keeping the viewer focused on exactly what's going on with this talented cast (boy do they give it their all). Try as I might though, I can't fault him. Entertaining and never boring, The Cotton Club excels at making the audience feel unsafe (just like the actual characters in the movie) and it's at least in my mind, a moderate success. This veritable gangster movie is the equivalent of a sugar rush ( in a good way of course). It's one club you might want to check out.

The set up and main plot were good. It gave the movie a grittiness mixed with romance that could have gone somewhere. However, many of the secondary plots were uninteresting and/or badly done. The Gregory Hines sub-plot was probably the worst of the lot drifts throughout, hammy acting and a lame attempt at exposing racial inequality in the 1920s.On that note, the movie does take a tilt at racial issues, but pulls its punches. An opportunity wasted.Writer-director Francis Ford Coppola and writer Mario Puzo, who also collaborated on The Godfather series, would have done better if they just took that Godfather formula and stuck to it. Make a gritty, hard- edged gangster movie, and that alone. Instead we have pointless sub- plots that add nothing and subtract a lot.Performances are varied, but mostly let the movie down. Richard Gere overacts in the lead role. His performance just feels so overdone at times it was hard to find convincing. Gregory Hines is even worse - hammy. James Remar also overdoes it as Dutch Schultz.Nicholas Cage (Francis Ford Coppola's nephew, by the way), is pretty bad in his role. Way over the top delivery, and just seems silly. Surprised his career lasted much longer, though am glad it did.Best performances come from Diane Lane (then only 18) and Bob Hoskins (though he isn't capable of a bad performance).The supporting cast also includes some big names, though some weren't famous at the time Tom Waits, Laurence Fishburn, Jennifer Grey (in her third movie). Sofia Coppola and Mario van Peebles have very minor roles.A bit more focus and better performances and this could have been a great movie.

The movie transports the viewer back in time to the Prohibition Era, when gangsters ruled, booze flowed, musicians jammed, and dancers tapped.Don't try to follow the plot it's not worth the bother. There is something for everyone in this movie music, dance, violence... even titillating lingerie and costumes for those with fetishes.My favorite scene is that in the Hoofer Club. Filming those old timers dancing was a glorious tribute to their talent, and well worth preserving for future generations. Needless to say, the dance sequences with the Hines brothers were excellent.Try to get past the limitations of the script and enjoy the ambiance of the Jazz Era, gone long ago, leaving us now only with rappers--whom I cannot even understand, thank goodness, and who have no talent in comparison to those performing in this film--and country singers, who are anything but country folk.

Filled with amazing direction,a wonderful cast and a fantastic score,The Cotton Club is Francis Coppola at his best.Set in Harlem,New York in the late 1920s and 30s,The Cotton Club is the story of the real life Night club and stories and various events that take place inside and outside the club including the story of Dixie Dwyer(Richard Gere),a Jazz Musician that's working for vicious Gangster Dutch Schultz(James Remar). While working for Dutch Dixie falls for Dutch's girlfriend Vera Cicero(Diane Lane)while dealing with his love for Jazz,other Gangsters,violence and danger all around.Francis Coppola's The Cotton Club is an amazing film that is known for being a troubled production with Coppola fighting with producer Robert Evans,the film going over budget with 58 million dollars,various scripts written for the movie and the film flopping at the Box Office and receiving mixed reviews from critics. But all of those things don't stop The Cotton Club from being the great film that it is and in my opinion this is a movie that deserves more respect. The Cotton Club is a film that right from the very beginning pulls you into an experience that takes you back to the world of the 1920's and 30s that dazzles you and leaves you floored and will make your jaw drop. It's a film that is beautiful and visually stunning and is filled with great style and substance that is memorable and powerful. With TCC,Francis Coppola mixes together two genres the Gangster film genre and the Musical and when the two genres come together there is fireworks and excitement balancing out violence,Tommy Guns with singing and dances sequences giving The Cotton Club an unforgettable style. Coppola also uses the classic movie style of Gangster movies from the 1930s such as The Public Enemy,Little Ceaser,Scarface,Angels With Dirty Faces and The Roaring Twenties and Coppola does it in his own way with classic style montages mixing the violence and chaos of the Harlem,New York streets with the various singing and dancing at The Cotton Club. Coppola'a love for classic cinema is full display with this film. The Gangster style and trademarks of the 1930s is also on full display here as well with Coppola bringing a realism and accuracy to the period making viewers feel like they are actually there in the 1930s. Also,The Cotton Club depicts a Gangster world where Money,Guns and violence rule the streets and no one is safe from death and destruction and as a viewer you are disturb by the Actions of the Gangsters while at the same time you are interested in what happens next. What I also like about this film is how it includes real life Gangsters and crime figures of the 1930s such as Dutch Schultz,Owney Madden,Charlie 'Lucky' Luciano and Harlem Gangster Bumpy Johnson(as Bumpy Rhodes in the film). The violence in the film is horrific and at times dark and very unexpected coming out of nowhere and Coppola goes back to the violence and style of his early Gangster films The Godfather I and II with The Cotton Club. The Musical and dance sequences in the film are excellent,stylish and done in such a flawless way that is beautiful and exciting. In each Musical and dance scene is done with perfection and great attention to detail the only way Coppola knows how to do it. Each of the main characters are flawed people but are memorable and interesting because nearly all of them want one common goalthe common goal of being a success either with music,money or being a Gangster. If there is a flaw and problem with The Cotton Club is the movie's length that is 127 minutes. Now the 127 minutes length is great but I always feel when I watch the film is that the running time was too short for this film and that it should have been longer between the running times of 140 to 160 minutes. It seems like Coppola had to cut out a lot things because he was fighting with Orion pictures and producer Robert Evans. I hope someday that Coppola will release a director's cut of the film and have more scenes with the main characters. The ending of the film is excellent and masterful with sequences that are effective and amazing and will show you why filmmaking is such a beautiful art form. A great and truly unforgettable conclusion. The whole cast is great. Richard Gere is excellent as Dixie Dwyer,with Gere bringing depth and charisma to the role. The late great Gregory Hines is brilliant as Sandman Williams,a tap dancer working at The Cotton Club. Diane Lane is amazing and beautiful as Vera Cicero,Dutch's girlfriend and Dixie's love interest. Lonette Mckee is great as Lila,a dancer and singer at The Cotton Club and Sandman's love interest. Bob Hopskins is fantastic as Owney Madden,the owner of The Cotton Club. James Remar is terrific and frightening as Dutch Schultz,with Remar bringing intensity to the role. Fred Gwynne is wonderful and funny as Frenchy,Owney's right hand man. Nicholas Cage is fabulous as Vincent Dwyer,Dixie's hot headed younger brother who works for Dutch. Lawerence Fishburne(Bumpy Rhodes),Allen Garfield(Abbadabba),Tom Waits(Irving Stark),Maurice Hines(Clay Williams),Julian Beck(Sol),John P. Ryan(Joe Flynn),Lisa Jane Persky(Francis),Glenn Withrow(Popke),Ron Karabatsos(Mike Best),Jennifer Grey(Patsy Dwyer),Gwen Verdon(Tish Dwyer),Joe Dallesandro(Charles 'Lucky' Luciano),Diane Verona(Gloria Swanson),Woody Strode(Holmes)and Ed O'Ross(Monk)give good performances as well The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and giving the film a beautiful visual style and tone. Great direction,Coppola.The score by John Barry is amazing,beautiful,haunting and intense and truly matches the film's style and tone. Fantastic score,Barry.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Musicals,Crime Dramas or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Cotton Club,a brilliant,underrated and dazzling film that deserves a second chance.

"},{"Title":"Music and Mayhem.","Date":"22 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Music","Review":" Richard Gere is a trumpet and piano player who is hired by the famous gangster Dutch Schultz to provide some music at parties and to squire around Dutch's girl friend, Diane Lane, when Dutch is busy browbeating and killing people elsewhere. Gere and Lane fall for each other. Complications ensue. There is a sub plot involving alienation between Gregory Hines and his brother, a duo tap-dancing act, and they finally make up. The plot centers around -- or whirls around -- the Cotton Club, a fashionable night club in Harlem in which talented African-Americans provided entertainment for rich white couples and celebrities.Frankly, I found myself confused about some of the turns in the plot. The one thing I was able to keep straight is that all the murderers and thick-necked traitorous goons were white, while the black folk were all good. Dutch Schultz (James Remar) is particularly contemptible. The guy has no sense of humor. He's always scowling. And he gives too many orders like, Get me a cigar, and Tie my shoes, and Where is my garter belt? After a scuffle with Richard Gere and Gregory Hines in The Cotton Club, he and his sour henchmen drive to The Palace Chop House in Newark, New Jersey, where they are shot to pieces by a rival gang. I was honestly glad to see Schultz get it. With Newark the way it is today, I don't think he'd have made it as far as the chop house.The Cotton Club was famous, really famous, and Harlem was aboom in the 1920s and part of the 30s. Duke Ellington played there, Fletcher Henderson, Cab Calloway, everybody who was anybody. It was called going slumming and was a must-visit for movie stars. An unrecognizable Diane Venora plays Gloria Swanson, who gets Gere a job as an actor in a Hollywood movie.How does is the Cotton Club's entertainment fitted into the movie? Not so neatly. There are some great performers, including Honey Coles, and Coppola lets the camera roll while they do their stuff -- once in a while, for two or three numbers. But he makes the same mistake he made with Fred Astaire in Finian's Rainbow. Too often he cuts directly from a dancer's upper torso to a close up of the dancer's feet. And the cuts are too fast to allow the audience to appreciate what's going on. And there is a LOT going on during a well-choreographed dance, with the performer's whole body involved. I can say this with some certainty because I studied dance and, after a good deal of effort, found that, as a dancer, I had all the finely honed skills of a performing seal. It really puzzled me. I asked myself, Self, what the hell is wrong with your kinetic sense?, but the answer was a confusing explanation of myoneural plates and I gave up trying to understand. Some people have it. Some don't.Richard Gere is the central figure and he does all right by the role. He's edgier and more impulsive than ever, which is saying a lot. When he gets the proper role, Gere can do it to death, although I must say I found him no more than adequate as my supporting player in the poetic masterpiece, No Mercy. I had to carry the kid through the whole picture by giving him sound advice like, Just say your lines and make sure you don't look at the camera. And, I swear, whoever dubbed his trumpet solos couldn't find anything inventive in the subdued variations on the melodic theme. Listen to Gere's solos and then listen to a CD of Bix Beiderbecke or Louis Armstrong.

I know, because I was a young boy back in the early 80's. And, if you want to see Diane Lane at her most enchanting hotness, then you might want to check out The Cotton Club? That is, if you don't mind sitting through a mess of a movie that's over 2hrs long, and you don't care what happens to any of the multitude of characters story lines. Except, maybe Diane Lane's character, because she was just that HOT.But, don't worry Cotton Club fans out there, I will include a few positive aspects in this review about the movie. That doesn't involve murder conspiracy's of drug dealing movie producers. Only because IMDb requires at least a 10 line minimum written review before it can be posted on their website. Which is about, 9 lines longer than I care to spend writing about The Cotton Club. But the rules are the rules.The best thing The Cotton Club has to offer an audience is its stellar ensemble cast of actors and actresses. Even the ones that aren't Diane Lane. Some were already well established TV and Movie stars like Richard Gere, Fred Gwynne, Gwen Verdon and Gregory Hines. While others weren't house hold names yet like Nicholas Cage, Laurance Fishburne, Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins. But, would go on later to become huge Stars despite their appearance in The Cotton Club. I guess someone up there likes them?However, despite the movies great ensemble cast, you just DO NOT care about any of the characters in the movie. It's really hard to say exactly why you don't care if Nicholas Cage's character is gun downed in a phone booth. Or if Gregory Hines, Richard Gere and Laurance Fishburn ever get the girl at the end of the movie. Maybe, it's because there were so many different characters, that you never cared about, who couldn't get the girl until the very end of the movie. The only time I ever cared about any of the characters who didn't get me aroused while watching them, like Diane Lane for example. Is when I felt Sad that the evil Mob boss Dutz Sholtz was eventually killed, because he was the only interesting character in the entire movie. The Cotton Clubs' writer/director Francis Ford Coppola has made some great movies and some stinkers. The Cotton Club is definitely at the top of Coppola's 'Stinker List'. I hope I finally have the required IMDb 10 line minimum to post a review this time? I really don't want to spend any more time writing about The Cotton Club. The movie gets a D- from me, but I will change my review to a C+ if someone knows if Diane Lane does any texting.

His 1984 film, The Cotton Club, centers on events at the famous Harlem nightclub during the late 20s and early 30s. The club was a whites only establishment but ironically utilized mostly black entertainers.PLOT As musician Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere) starts chumming around with mobsters in order to advance his career, he slowly gets involved with the young moll (Diane Lane) of a snarling gangster (James Remar) and eventually becomes a Hollywood actor with the help of the club's owner (Bob Hoshkins). Meanwhile a black entertainer at the club, Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines), gets involved with a half-black singer (Lonette McKee), who sometimes passes herself off as white for convenience and career. Also on hand are Nicholas Cage as Dwyer's brother, who gets mixed up with the mob and becomes a public enemy, and the hulking Fred Gwynne as the club owner's right-hand man.To be expected, there's quite a bit of mob nastiness, but it's nicely balanced out by the music & entertainment. While I'm not a big fan of the music of that period, there are a couple of numbers that really impressed me, including one by McKee's character. The gangster shenanigans are also balanced out by quite a few other aspects, particularly the fact that the film has heart. In short, despite being mainly a mobster movie with a huge side of song & dance, there's some warmth here and there. Also, it's nice to see Fred Gwynne play someone other than Herman Munster.FINAL WORD I was mainly interested in The Cotton Club because of Coppola's genius and the film's infamous production. In addition, the movie's a great way to sort of go back in time to the Prohibition-era and get a taste of what it was like, Hollywoodized and overdone though it may be.The film was shot in New York City and runs 2 hours 7 minutes.GRADE B "},{"Title":"great jazz score enriches this hybrid period piece; a gangster movie with many musical and dance numbers.","Date":"8 January 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Music","Review":" Francis Ford Coppola exploded onto the scene with the stylishly original classic 'The Godfather' in 1972. A little over a decade later he made the lesser renowned but yet more notorious (for its production problems and bloated budget) 'The Cotton Club', a fact meets fiction throwback to the movies of the 1930s when gangster films (as well as comedies, etc) often incorporated musical and dance scenes. Today, while the Godfather resides on most of the best-ever movie lists, the Cotton Club is mired in obscurity&#x85;a largely forgotten near-miss. The film is stunning visually and has many other redeeming qualities however; James Remar chews the scenery effectively as a rabid Dutch Schultz, women can watch Richard Gere, men can watch the delectable Diane Lane, and the rest can watch the dazzling tap sequences of the Hines brothers and bask in all the period music.Trouble is brewing in 1930s Harlem as Dixie Dwyer (Gere), an up and coming actor, musician and mob fringe-dweller is asked by Schultz to chaperon his mistress, aspiring wannabe club owner Vera Cicero (Lane) and sparks immediately start to fly. Meanwhile Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins), the owner of the Cotton club is preparing for an upcoming prison stint and the local mob figures are vying for position and it appears a mob war is on the horizon.Also, Sandman Williams is starting his dance career and, along with his brother(Gregory and Maurice Hines), is seeking stardom at Harlems' famous Cotton Club. Sandman is also trying to court one of the clubs other entertainers (Lonette McKee) and his aspirations are coming between he and his brother and they eventually split. Also in the mix is Dixie's little brother, a young overzealous mob hit-man Mad Dog Dwyer (Nicholas Cage), who like the Sandman seems to be letting his ambition get the better of him.These (and other) story lines will all intersect in and around the Cotton Club as the strong-willed Vera fights for independence from the psychotic Schultz, which in turn puts Dixie in a dangerous predicament. Owney's prison term approaches, Mad Dog gets in over his head and Sandman has a heartwarming on-stage reunion with his brother. As we reach the climax Schultz's behavior has become intolerable and as Madden is leaving for prison we are treated to a masterful cinematic display as images of a high profile mob hit are alternated with shots of Sandman's stair step tap routine; beauty and brutality both captured in one memorable montage.There is a lot to enjoy in The Cotton Club; we get some of the great character actors like Fred Gwynne, Tom Waits, John P. Ryan and Remar, as well as future stars like Lawrence Fishburne, Jennifer Grey and Cage (who is Coppola's nephew by the way). Many of the characters are real such as Schultz, Sandman, Lucky Luciano and a young Bumpy Johnson (the same Bumpy Johnson that Denzel Washington's character worked for in the beginning of 'American Gangster').No it's not the Godfather but just as entertaining in its own way. In the early 90s when I first saw this I'd have rated it 8 or 9&#x85;but hey, it still plays well but this is an unappreciated film, for whatever reason. It is a tad long and the vast array of characters are mostly one-dimensional, but still the Cotton Club is well worth a watch.It gives us a glimpse into the culture and the fantastic jazz music of this long gone era. This was the era when common guys like Dixie Dwyer had a good chance of making it big, an era where a strong willed woman could overcome the clutches of a madman, an era when people in movies were liable to break out in song or dance at any time&#x85;even in Union Station, and it was an era when the hero got the girl and they rode off happily ever after.

I must admit that the continuity was so choppy that I felt I was watching a trailer, or the kind of salvage job hacked together after a fire at the studio. Nevertheless, what did emerge was enjoyable for the dancing and if you really don't care about the characters or who they are and why they are doing what they do, then you have a visually attractive and entertaining two hours.My BIG complaint was the atrocious close captioning which missed out half the dialogue and was generally chopped up so that half a word would appear on screen followed a minute later by the rest of the word. Had there been subtitles in English it would not have mattered so much, but for the hearing impaired who depend on close captioning to supply the words that they miss, it was a disaster.

This film, along with the Vietnam War films, The Godfather Trilogy, Cimeno's three epics and Altman's series of brilliant films, all constituted a renaissance of movie production. I long for those films where the magic of the directors was allowed to produce movies of insurmountable greatness.I do not involve myself with movie dialog when watching a film; rather, I am swept up in the visuals the camera shot selection, the lighting, the beauty and accuracy of the sets and wardrobes, the cinematography and the lighting. These visuals pull me so deeply into the movie that my small mind has no room for the words spoken, unless those words are so silly that they draw attention to themselves and the actor cannot save them from unscripted laughter.Cotton Club's totality of depth and richness was reflected in the musical numbers and the accompanying dance. I kept thinking that this movie will never be repeated because the ability won't be available; this is not to say that there will be no talent, only that the art form will have been lost out of disuse.Watch this film and marvel at what we have lost and be saddened by the losses that we are unknowingly unaware.

As well as the cinematography and how the filmmakers captured the era. However, I could really care less about the characters. The film's characters are supposed to be based on the real gangsters and African-American musicians that made the Cotton Club famous. But, after over twenty drafts I get the idea that director Francis Ford Coppola didn't exactly know what he wanted to accomplish with this project. The other thing that bothers me about this movie is the editing. There is a scene in which most of the main characters are at The Cotton Club and we are presented with about three or four musical numbers intercut with the characters communicating. Like about a minute is devoted to each of the musical numbers. Why would you do that? These were excellent musical numbers that should have been given some proper screen time. I know that it isn't part of the plot or anything, but it's part of The Cotton Club. After all this movie is supposed to be a fictional account of the Club's history. It's important to capture the story of the gangsters and musicians, but also devote screen time to the great music and dancing that made the club so famous.As for the performances I think they were all good. I really liked the work Richard Gere and the rest of actors did. I didn't really care about the characters but their performances made it watchable. Especially Diane Lane who is beautiful in this film. Gere and Lane reunited almost two decades later for the much better film, Unfaithful.

You never want to leave. Gregory Hines' dancing is the kind you could watch for hours. But the best scene in Cotton Club is when the gorgeous Lonette McKee takes the stage to sing a stunning version of Ill Wind. She is as beautiful as young Lena Horne, a feast for the eyes and ears. The director was wise not to place this number too early in the film because the movie never recovers afterward. Not that there was a lot to recover.Nick Cage is in there somewhere, so is Laurence Fishburne. Joe Dallisandro makes a cameo at the end as a gangster. All he does is sit there, but he was still handsome then and eye-candy was just about all the white leads offer in Cotton Club.One of these days a director is going to make a movie about the New York City of the twenties or early thirties that will have vitality and wit, peopled with the legendary theatrical characters of that era (Tallulah, Robert Benchley, the Barrymores for example). Not like the one from Alan Rudolph about Dorothy Parker; Jennifer Jason Leigh and Campbell Scott tried hard to save that one but the director was all over the place as usual doing his poor Robert Altman impression.

All the subplots meld nicely to give you a look at the prohibition era; unlike many movies made today there is little PC moralizing-away of finer plot points. Coppola is never ham handed as he shows us underage floozies, shoot-em-ups, racism or anything else prohibition style. Diane lane is sexy as hell and has terrific chemistry with Richard gere (who even plays his own coronet solos--and well!). Seeing the sadly deceased talent Gregory hines and his real life (also talented) brother as a tapping team is alone very worth the price of rental. These two have a very touching scene together as do Fred Gwynne (the original Herman Munster) and an endearingly smarmy Bob hoskins. Authentic scenes with now dead tap legends who were just hitting puberty during the real prohibition add an air of real nostalgia that cannot be duplicated---hell, it's 2005, and now most anyone who remembers the real cotton Club is dead or senile.

Mr. Coppola made a visually stunning film that focus on the old days in the famous Harlem night club that was the place where a lot of black stars got their start in show business.The film concentrates in the mobsters that were running all the rackets in Harlem, rather than in what was going on at the club. The setting is just a pretext for the story. By concentrating in the white gangsters, the story suffers. It's only when the action switches to the black performers working at the Cotton Club that some life comes into the screen.The film, as a canvas, is interesting to see, but some of the vignettes don't work. The Dixie Dwyer of Richard Gere doesn't go anywhere. Mr. Gere is a bland presence amid all the violence around him. Nicolas Cage's Vincent Dwyer seems like an after thought. On the other hand, the great Gregory Hines and Lonette McKee shine as a pair of black performers that find themselves in love.The movie also points out to the discrimination the Cotton Club regulars received from the whites in charge of running the place.

Now it's available as a freebie with a National newspaper and I've watched it again without changing my opinion by a jot. Judging by other comments here it seems that once again we have been watching different films. It's hard to pin down what's wrong with it; maybe it's the blending of fact and fiction; Dutch Schultz was a real person as was Owney Madden - though he was actually Welsh and not, as Hoskins claims in one scene, Irish. The Richard Gere character is a bad blending of George Raft and Bix Beiderbecke - though there were several white trumpet players around in 1928 Beiderbecke was the only white CORNET player with any kind of profile, so if they didn't mean Beiderbecke why not make Gere a trumpet player; Raft was cosy with the mob since his teens, was a professional gigolo (as Gere admits in one scene) and got his movie break in Scarface, based on Al Capone, a notorious gangster, though Raft had a supporting role unlike Gere who is the king of crime. By 1984 Raft - who never, of course, played either trumpet or cornet - could surely have been identified as clearly as Madden and Schultz. Apart from this the whole mish mosh is unconvincing with little attempt at period 'feel' and pedestrian song and dance. How bad? Let me count the ways.

It's just a mess, almost a complete mess, with many miscalculations on the part of the screenwriters, director, and actors contributing to a zombie of a film which angers one all the more because of what it could have been if all the elements had been put together in a more compelling fashion.It's really 2 completely separate films, one of them about musician Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere) and his brother (Nicolas Cage) who join up with ruthless NYC mobster Dutch Schultz (James Remar) to make more money, and the other about dancer Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines) and his brother (Maurice Hines) who as black men in the 1920s are paid to perform at the famed Cotton Club but would not be allowed to patronize the club as fans. The irony and tragedy of this situation is played upon throughout the film but ultimately dispelled without any explanation as to why the club was desegregated in the end.I think a very enjoyable normal length feature could have been built around the Hines Brothers and Sandman's romance with Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), a young dancer trying to pass for white to further her career. As it is the parts with the dancing and singing, as well as some of the backstage stuff, provides the best parts of the film. But the whole gangster story with Gere really does not pay off for a variety of reasons. First of all James Remar's performance is pitiful; he seems to have an extremely limited range, basically he is either violently out of control or petulantly agitated. He does not project the kind of screen presence and power that the character demands and he is not interesting to watch on screen. Since I've never seen him in anything else it makes me suspect that this was an attempt to place an unknown in a showy role and gain some attention for the film and the actor; if that's the case this film failed miserably. The scene where he attacks a rival mobster is embarrassingly gratuitous and feels like a rip-off of the DePalma Scar Face. Gere doesn't fare much better &#150; the only good parts of his performance were the very first scenes when he's wearing sunglasses. As soon as he takes them off and you can really observe his acting the whole thing starts to really unravel. He and his romantic co-star Diane Lane are simply not capable of pulling off their parts. Cage's performance is equally poor as he blusters and stomps around chewing scenery and trying to attract attention to himself. The only saving grace of this whole story track is Bob Hoskins as the owner of the Cotton Club and Fred Gwynn as his henchman; both actors are extraordinary and make the movie watchable while they're on screen, both funny and suitably scary. But this is a case of good performances salvaging part of a weak story &#150; their parts aren't especially interesting or well-written, they just brought them to life in a convincing way. This entire gangster story is a big clich√©, with nothing to surprise you and nothing to make you care about the characters or consider them as anything but 2 dimensional impressions of real people like Texas Guinan and George Raft.Because so much time is spent developing these uninteresting characters who are played by unimpressive actors, the part of the story that's actually interesting and fun is pushed to the sidelines. In much the same way, I might add, that the colored performers were themselves pushed out of the limelight as soon as their performances were finished at the original Cotton Club. It's almost certainly intentional, but still completely regrettable. I can't understand otherwise why the black and white segments of the story were kept so completely separate, until the symbolic desegregation of the Cotton Club itself occurs. I'm guessing this is a concept film in that regard and I think that the characters and story were sacrificed for the concept or constructed around the concept and this probably accounts for the many of the film's prominent weaknesses. The production is gorgeous, the songs and dances are done well-enough -- but not with the kind of style and skill that you would have seen from actual performers of the era like Bill Robinson, the Berry Brothers or the Nicholas Brothers. Hines' moves are quite a bit lighter and more self-consciously arty and balletic than what you would actually have seen in the Cotton Club in the 1920s. But it's well enough done that probably those who are being introduced to the scene by this film might enjoy the dances enough to seek out some of the originals. The scene with the old-timers in the pool hall showing their moves is actually a lot closer to what I imagine as the real deal. These scenes really are a joy to watch but even they don't really make it a film worth watching in my opinion, not at its excessive running length, miscalculated performances/casting, and conventional story. Coppola has been known to go out on a limb and I admire him for it, but in this case he fell on his backside. He could have trimmed it down and made a stylized period film with an intimate feeling (kind of like Rumble Fish), but instead this film is closer to the Coppola of Peggy Sue and Tucker &#150; big flashy production with nice period cars, costumes, music and a good character performance or two (Martin Landau in Tucker, Bob Hoskins in Cotton Club) but essentially empty exercises in high-concept film-making for the masses.
