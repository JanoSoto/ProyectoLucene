I'm not one to criticise or analyse, but tend to view a film as a whole. The courtroom scenes were infomative(as to procedure)as well as amusing, and the romantic interest was endearing. Especially enchanting was Charlize Theron, as waitress Billie Tyler, as she was cheerful, kindly, and even brave (when she thought she had lost her boyfriend to a rival).  Yet it was she who innocently caused the whole problem - by serving her own alcoholic cocktail!I'm putting this movie among my favourites.

Each of the main characters is playing a role that is somehow contrary to that person's real identity. In the case of the Rip Torn character, who is on trial for fraud, the deception is obvious, despite his ludicrous attempt to justify his fraudulent actions. And it is equally obvious in the case of the Michael Richards character, who is pretending to be a lawyer to help out his friend. But the other characters also are revealed to be different than who they appear to be.This is a wonderful movie, which raises important questions about the veneer most of us use to hide our real selves. Like most good comedians (e.g., Robin Williams, Steve Martin), Michael Richards is also a fine actor, and his closing argument in the case is an especially masterful piece of acting.

What ensues is a complete loss of control of a simple thing and the way in which the different characters handle it.The irony of the whole thing is that the harder the serious ones tried to control the situation, the more out of control the thing got.The real brilliance though, lies in Richards' character, Richard Rietti. Playing as an actor, he approaches life as one big play, and the lawyer as yet another role. All the world's a stage. I think this movie points this out for us.

It took me this long to finally get around to seeing it, even though I've been familiar with the two stars for quite some time now. I've seen Jeff Daniels as Jim Carrey's co-star in Dumb & Dumber, and knew the now infamous Michael Richards obviously for his role as Kramer in the popular sitcom, Seinfeld, plus his roles in comedy films such as UHF and So I Married an Axe Murderer. Since I had seen both of these actors in funny movies/TV shows, I figured I might find Trial and Error mildly amusing, nothing more, judging by its general reception. Expecting a mixed blessing, I didn't get any big surprises, pleasant or unpleasant.Charles Tuttle (Daniels) is a lawyer who will soon be married. His best friend, and best man for the wedding, is an out-of-work actor named Richard Rietti (Richards). Tuttle has been called over to Paradise Bluff, Nevada to defend his fianc√©e's relative, Benny Gibbs, in a class action fraud suit. When he arrives in the town, Richard (or Ricky) is there, and is ready to throw a bachelor party for his friend. After drinking and getting attacked in the bar, Charlie is not well enough to work the next day, so Ricky decides to go to the courtroom and claim to be a lawyer named Charles Tuttle! Charlie is not happy when he hears what Ricky has done, and soon finds that he now has to pose as an actor named Richard Rietti! Since the real Rietti is not trained to be a lawyer, the real Charlie pretends to be his assistant, using cue cards to tell him what to do on the job while he defends Benny. Obviously, this leads to a horrible mess! There weren't too many times when I laughed really hard while watching this 1997 comedy, but there were many parts I found at least mildly amusing. I can't forget Ricky discovering that his sick friend in bed has emptied out his pill bottle, Ricky trying to prepare Charlie for the trial while he is ill, Charlie's reaction when he learns what Ricky has done, and many things the main characters go through while they pose as each other. Michael Richards and Jeff Daniels are a good pair in the lead roles, which might be the main reason why this film is funny. Richards, with his over-the-top antics, playing a character with good intentions who keeps lousing up, and Daniels, with some of the faces he makes and his character's reactions to Ricky's doings. Unfortunately, the plot isn't too interesting, and if the film were hilarious, that wouldn't matter, but it's not funny enough to prevent the movie from being a little dull. Also, the romance wasn't done so well, eventually getting a little sappy, and the ending leaves much to be desired.This movie came out the same year as Liar Liar, another lawyer comedy. That film is definitely the more popular of the two, but I have to be honest, I prefer this one, as crazy as many people might think I am for that. While Jim Carrey has made me laugh in other films, I found that his antics went too far in that one. Richards and Daniels, while not usually hilarious in the film, are still pretty funny. I'm sure we all know about Richards' racist tirade in November 2006, which obviously permanently damaged his reputation and started a never ending debate over whether he really meant what he said and whether his apology was honest or not. It clearly had more impact than Mel Gibson's tirade earlier that year, and the main reason for that was probably because Richards was caught on video. I remember feeling like I could never watch anything with Richards in it again after I first heard about the incident and saw the footage, but now, regardless of his reputation and what may go on in his head, I have to admit, he can still make me laugh in the comedies I see him in. If you like the two co-stars in Trial and Error as comedians, then this flick could easily make you laugh, or at least some parts could.

That's because this film is much more than a comedy romance. How can anyone miss the satire of our court system and the law profession? This film has some wonderful spoofing of attorneys, judges, juries, witnesses, and big law firms. It also has a very clear critique and commentary on social classes, the trifles of high society weddings, ambition and personal quest for power and wealth, marriages of convenience without love, and more. In an early scene, we see the two leading men in one's new law office. It's a wrap-around corner with glass windows and views over the whole city, and a huge waste of space. The ridiculousness of it is accentuated by the solitary desk and chair across a huge room with nothing else in it.The film touches on the scams and frauds being perpetrated in our country, especially against the gullible. My one complaint is that the writers might have chosen a better scam to be prosecuting &#x96; one in which older people especially get taken to the cleaners. But then, this one lends itself perfectly to spoofing and the hilarious courtroom drama. To get an engraved likeness of Abraham Lincoln for just $17.99? Who couldn't bite? Indeed, how we no longer count our pennies as a society! Trial and Error is not a movie of many funny and witty lines. Or even a great deal of romance. It doesn't have a lot of situations for out-loud laughter. That may be why many of the viewers drawn to it don't think much of the film. But, again, had the film been promoted for its satire and breadth, it likely would have drawn a wider audience and much greater appreciation. Of course, there are some very good scenes of laughter. Michael Richards plays Richard Rietti, an actor who is out of work at the time. Jeff Daniels plays his friend, Charles Tuttle, who is a lawyer. Jeff says he hopes Richard didn't do his godfather routine at his recent tryout. In a flashback, we see Richard doing just that. He's hilarious and has tremendous body machinations. He bounces from one wall to another, flies across a room, falls to the floor and twists and turns in reaction to imaginary punches, kicks and throws from imaginary mob men. The courtroom scenes are peppered with very funny antics from various people &#x96; Richard and Charles especially. But the judge too gets in the picture. Austin Pendleton plays Judge Graff. Could his name be an intentional play on words (as in graft and corruption)? And the jury members are definitely part of the fun and farce. Rip Torn, as Benny Gibbs, gives one of the best down and out pity stories on film intended to evoke laughter. And it does, with me. In another scene, Richard is in his hotel room watching a video on trial procedures. The speaker is the legendary Wyoming trial attorney Gerry Spence. He strikes a chord with Richard when he says that the courtroom is like a stage play and the trial lawyer is in charge. He's the producer, director and star of the show. The film has subtle humor throughout, as Charles tries to stick to the facts while Richard goes for the theatrics. The court system is supposed to rely on the facts, but clearly, emotions will win out most of the time. That's because of the human element. One must wonder if justice is truly served, or if it is mostly a huge stage for lawyers to get rich. This film brings all that to the fore; and it spoofs the testimony of expert witnesses as well. Charles says to Richard at one point, that money will always find people willing to testify one way or another. Lying is a part of the game. But, after a while, our heroes decide they want to change and have the system work for real justice. That's the conclusion of the film. And, oh yes, there is romance and real love for both leading men. They are helped along by good performances from Charlize Theron as Billie Tyler and Jessica Steen as Elizabeth. One last plus for the film is the setting. It's supposed to be in Lone Pine, Nevada, for which road signs were made. But it was shot in and around Lone Pine, California. So, the film has nice scenic shots of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This is a delightful film and spoof. Those who watch it for what it is are sure to enjoy it immensely.

Michael Richards is his best man, a struggling actor.  The firm sends Daniels to a town in the middle of nowhere to defend a man accused of fraud, which means his bachelor party has to be postponed.  No, it doesn't!  Richards and the gang show up in Nowheresville and have the party anyway. Daniels gets beat up, and Richards makes a mistake with his medication, meaning Daniels is in no shape to go to court the next day.  Richards knows all Daniels plans to do is ask for a continuance, so he goes to court posing as Daniels' character.  The beautiful female prosecutor (romantic interest for Richards?) refuses, demanding that the trial start right away.  Daniels is feeling better when the trial starts but, of course, he and Richards could get in a lot of trouble, so Daniels poses as Richards' associate.  Richards stumbles through jury selection and the first part of the trial and the judge can't understand why an associate is giving him so much help.  Daniels ends up getting himself thrown out of the courtroom, and the funniest moments in the movie come from his attempts to communicate with Richards.  Later, Daniels starts a romance with a waitress he met at the bachelor party, who he later met and told he was Richards' character. The movie's tone changes about halfway through, still funny at times but no longer farcical.  Richards reminds me a lot of his Kramer character, clumsy but able to pull off a scam quite well, even if he never approaches being convincing as a real lawyer.  But the prosecutor describes his performance as Oscar-worthy, and that's not too far off. SPOILERS FOLLOW  Richards eventually gets what he wants but isn't happy about it, and Daniels realizes he wasn't happy in his old life.  There is still more to the movie, and it isn't entirely clear what will happen.  The moral dilemmas and how they were handled make the movie a little more substantial.  Still, how Daniels handled his romantic situation seemed a little too neat and tidy.  We are left to assume how it must have happened.  An enjoyable picture.  If you really want to know the funniest moments, Daniels falls through the courtroom ceiling after communicating through the heating vent, and using a walkie-talkie and a variation on Morse Code with the car horn, Daniels attempts to feed signals to Richards , but a near-accident resulting in lots of angry horn-blowing results in a frenzy of ridiculous objections from Richards.

Michael Richards plays a struggling actor who plans a bachelor party for his brother, played by Jeff Daniels. Daniels represents a fraud case but during a fight at a bar he is clobbered and takes all of his prescription pills. As predicted Richards will take his brother's place in court. Directed by Jonathan Lynn who made Sgt. Bilko the previous year. The two leads render this formula comedy beyond what it might have been without them. Richards recites his famous role on Seinfeld where his nightclub act must double as a lawyer when he is faced with doubling as his brother. Daniels does well as the real lawyer nursing a bar fight headache. He uses cue cards in his attempt to assist his brother in doing his job. He is also being cared for by a waitress whom he obviously will take a shine to. Charlize Theron plays the waitress and the role is as deadpan as it sounds. Rip Torn steals moments as the obviously guilty man on trial whom Richards uses slick thinking to expose. Jessica Steen plays a lawyer who ends up as a predictable romantic interest. The film exists mainly as a stage for Richards for his starring debut but despite its overly sitcom delivery, it will hopefully lead to better things for the comic.

In brief; every time this movie has the opportunity to make fun, it retracts. Is it laziness ? Average sense of comedy ? Whatever the reason is, while having the irony (Trial and Error) doesn't use it well, or doesn't use it.On the contrary, it has so wonderful meaning about stopping the lying, in a way most of the similar movies didn't have. The moment of the concluding pleading is heartwarming and overwhelming. It sums up the movie's core perfectly. Sad that with stronger comedy, this could have been evenly perfect movie itself.I loved the scene of (Jeff Daniels) talking about the early-brilliant's tragedy, the one who lives a chain reaction of being superior then less and less as time goes by. It's the scary opposite relationship between intelligence and freedom. More intelligence equals less freedom, hence less happiness. This movie shows it in impressive simplicity, running as a play on the main theme as well, whereas the character used to lie, yet on himself, as if he's happy while he isn't. Slight bugging matters  the strange biker had been pictured first as (Daniels)'s attention line and fascinating fantasy (with one important zoon-in); that was confusing a bit, especially when we discover lately that she'd be his friend's girl. Then, how come (Charlize Theron) forgave (Daniels) that simple, I still can't explain the big hug near the end knowing the hurting slap she got hours ago by his arrogant fianc√©e ?! And lastly, the movie leaves us, incredibly happy, while its 2 leading men could, or would, meet many years in jail for what they already have done. They both are going to be exposed easily. Not to mention what job exactly (Daniels) will have ? I mean when a movie like this doesn't answer questions like these, even by swift answers, then whether it prepares for a sequel or something was hasty about its ending.(Jeff Daniels) is a fair actor, but not a great comedian, besides he lacks the charismatic persona. (Michael Richards) is a nice talent. Look at his super slapstick comedy in his audition scene (I don't know what these examiners were uneasy about ?!). Or to the way he performed his serious scenes. Accordingly I don't know why he couldn't make a cinematic career away from his trademark Cosmo Kramer of Seinfeld ?! What I do know is that he didn't have a proper chance to blossom and flourish. (Rip Torn) and (Charlize Theron), with more capturing presence and talent, surpassed (Daniels) and (Richards). (Theron) in specific looked like fresh dream, and despite her short experience back then, she acted so naturally. It's smooth and meaningful afternoon movie. I began to feel that this term, afternoon movie, got a lot to do with the light movies. As if the more complicated or satisfied ones are more fit for the night. As a comedy it could have been better if only it wasn't full of too many anti-climaxes, where you're about to laugh, then you're not. It's where I desired a remake for the very movie I was watching !

If you see *any* blood resulting from a PG-13 punch, it's a trickle; in this movie it's a gusher. It's just so odd! This was not a bad movie--but I'm just ooked out by these occasional flashes of uncommonality.

I thought Michael Richards was one of the funniest actors out there, and I absolutely loved him as Kramer.  And of course, the film doesn't live up to its trailer--and that's something I still feel, even after my second viewing.  The trailers make us assume this is a raucous, fast-paced comedy with lots of physical schtick, when it's actually a lot more low-key.  It's strange because at the time I wasn't aware that Jonathan Lynn directed this film and I thought to myself, Geez, 'My Cousin Vinny' was so much funnier.  Whoever this director is should've learned from that movie.  Of course, Vinny is one of my favorite comedies of all time and it's extremely difficult to top a wonderfully original courtroom comedy of that kind. Anyway, there was a sale at my local West Coast Video, where I was able to purchase 5 videos for 19.99, so I decided to pick up Trial and Error, with a gut feeling that this time I'll probably keep a more open mind and enjoy it a lot more.  Well, I popped in the tape and I was impressed.  This is a funny film, and I got a lot more laughs than I did when sitting in the theater.  Sure, it's no My Cousin Vinny and I can't help but watch a courtroom comedy with that comparison in mind, but I was still able to enjoy it for what it is.  Michael Richards is not nearly as funny as Joe Pesci, but he was able to deliver some laughs without being over-the-top, which I found impressive.  Sure, I loved him as Kramer, but the movie's name is Trial and Error and not Seinfeld, and his job to play a CHARACTER.  And he did a fine job at playing this character, even showing in certain scenes that he has potential as a serious actor.  Richards is a good actor, and not simply a comedian who transfers his act to the big screen, like in the case of a Chris Tucker or Cedric the Entertainer.  Jeff Daniels is a very funny straight man, and some of his emotional outbursts are really enjoyable to watch.  Charlize Theron is her normal beautiful, charming self.  I just wish Alexandra Wentworth could've been given a less thankless role.  She doesn't get much chance to flaunt her talents as a comic actress.  *******SPOILERS AHEAD*********What prevents the movie from being a great, memorable comedy is its predictable, utterly formulaic plot.  Daniels is engaged to a woman, who he obviously doesn't like in the first place, and from one twist of fate he falls for another woman and decides to bump the marriage.  And of course, there's the case with Richards, where he pulls his fake lawyer act disastrously at first, improves as he goes along and finally has an attack of conscience and decides to lose the case, allowing the slimy defendant to pay his debt to society.  Didn't I see that in Liar Liar?  And other movies of this sort?  Despite its flaws, I liked the movie and was able to accept it for what it is...the second time around.  I imagine others had the same feelings as I did on the first viewing.  Trial and Error isn't a must-see, but it's worth watching.  My score  7 (out of 10)       "},{"Title":"I don't care what he is in, hes still Kramer","Date":"17 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This was pretty much an effort to capitalize on the success of Michael Richards from Seinfeld.

Daniels is the lawyer in trouble, doing a favour for his boss, defending Rip Torn's wonderfully roguish swindler the week before wedding the bosses daughter, Richards is the accident-prone actor friend along for the ride, who ends up sparking a farcical few days when he has to stand in for Daniels at the trial. The story is simple, predictable but no less fun for it, the pace is good, finding the right balance between the courtroom scenes and the shenanigans outside where Daniels is romanced away from his unappealing bride-to-be by a pretty, only slightly kooky Charlize Theron. It isn't a great film, doesn't have much by way of originality or innovation but doesn't claim to, it's just simple, undemanding entertainment, perfectly adequate for a bit of a giggle of a Sunday afternoon "},{"Title":"WHY EVEN BOTHER MAKING A MOVIE LIKE THIS??","Date":"3 September 1999","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Why in the world was this movie even in the theatures, it was so boring and un funny.

On the other hand, it was difficult to understand what was going on. I couldn't understand this movie, and it was far out too cheesy to me.

Better than I expected.  Horribly predictable and some of the jokes misfire, but the characters are likable enough.  The courtroom scene with Rip Torn on the stand should have been dispensed with, or better yet, written VERY differently.  I know it's a comedy, but a little realism would have been appreciated; even OJ didn't BS that badly (not on the stand, but in depositions etc.).  However, the jurors ultimate decision helps make up for the ridiculousness of the whole thing, even if the initial reaction was extremely dumb.  I like Jeff Daniels and think Michael Richards was the only good thing about Seinfeld, and consequently they have to fail pretty badly for me to dislike anything they do, so if you don't agree with my view of them, you might very well also not agree with my assessment of this movie.

I was skeptical at first but was convinced that this movie was terrific after having watched the first five minutes of it. If I were a martian from the future and had a mission to destroy earth unless the human race presented me with their best work of art; I hope that this is what they would show me.

Enter best friend Michael Richards (of Seinfeld fame) who decides to pose as Daniels when he is unable to go to court the first day of trial. Richards, a ham actor in the film, naturally knows nothing about law and Daniels has to teach and instruct as the trial starts and continues. Light-weight fluff that is not bad for the genre, but really this is nothing more than a long-running gag. Richards does his usual television routine and ends up stealing the show from the usually impressive Daniels (I don't know what he is doing in this).

Well this movie outlines it quite well. The plot is interesting but the movie is nothing more than pure stupidity. The judge does not seem to be at all interested in actually running the case while the lawyer, Jeff Daniels, turns out to be nothing more than a bumbling fool.His friend, the one who takes over the case for him, knows absolutely nothing about law and can do absolutely nothing with out his friend beside him (or at least in communication range). Yet the movie always takes the lawyer away to leave us laughing at the ineptitude of the friend, who happens to be an actor.This movie really has nothing that makes it stand out. The lawyer is engaged to be married to a rich girl who is the daughter of the boss of the law firm for whom he works, but he gives her up for a sweet city girl come country girl who has a humble background. The actor is chasing one particular woman all the way through the movie, that is the prosecutor, and gets away with things such as sexual harassment. In the end he lands up with her, which is very typical of Hollywood.The name of the town, Paradise Bluff, brings up some thoughts, as if it is a place that on the outside seems perfect, but deep within there is some rotting evil. In this movie though, there is no allusion, nor is there any hidden evil. Paradise Bluff is a Paradise where the heroes live happily ever after.In my opinion, Trial and Error is a very dull movie with little to no comedy in it at all. It is not worth hiring, nor is it worth wasting one's time watching it on TV. The only time one should even consider watching this movie is when you are stuck on a bus between Adelaide and Sydney, and there is no way off.

With a critical thumbs up rating I expected it to be better and funnier than it actually is. First off, even though Michael Richards is a fine actor, he relies too heavily on playing the same character he made famous in the Seinfeld TV series. You know, stumbling on the simplest things, almost mutilating a book while trying to nervously replace it in the bookshelf. I absolutely cannot stand those antics of his and every scene of his up to near the end was difficult for me to enjoy. Second, the premise of an actor pretending to be a lawyer, and the attendant legal issues was a bit far fetched for a movie that actually purports to be more serious in the way it ends.  Theron and Daniels are perfect in their roles, but the story and Richards' acting dragged it down for me to a 5 rating.  Absurd story but not funny enough.some SPOILERS for my recollection, please read no further.Daniels, lawyer, engaged to boss's spoiled daughter, goes to small Nevada town, continuance sought, drunk night before, actor friend goes to court, continuance denied, trouble begins, legal hot water, motorcycle-riding pretty prosecutor, absurd trial, Daniels fell through ceiling, banned from courtroom, fiancee shows up after Daniels and Theron began courting, he realizes he prefers the quiet life, breaks off wedding plans, stays with Theron, Richards and prosecutor fall in love.

Theron shows promise though she has to create her performance as she is given nothing by the material.  Perhaps the funniest moment in the film comes when Torn tells his sob story after he puts himself on the stand.  I got the impression Jeff Daniels wasn't trying very hard in this film, but you can't blame him given the tired storyline and studio-oriented vision.  The script was most likely written by a computer, or more likely a desperate, soulless, sellout of a hack with a talent for gag suppression.  For diehard Michael Richards fans only.

In an unbelievable sequence of events, Richards assumes Daniels' identity and defends a con artist client. Michael Richards still suffers from the Sienfeld hangover and looked very uncomfortable in his biggest starring role to date. Daniels struggles to keep the movie going with an uninspiring performance.
