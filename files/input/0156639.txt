Ferguson, who is HORRIBLE on Drew Carey, is every bit as wonderful in this smart, well acted, clever and sweet mockumentary which is surprisingly not a Christpher Guest production, and luckily with no Eugene Levy in sight!This film is a surprise, it's a sleeper, and probably did  0 box office in the US, but, give yourself a treat.

I have watched it several times, and find it more entertaining each time. I recently read a quote of Craig Ferguson's in a Reel.com interview, saying that the movie somewhat parallels his experience in Hollywood. He said, it is an exact mirror image of the show business that I know. I believe that the story in the movie is my story in America, and when asked how Crawford's experience in America paralleled with his own, Craig replied, It's exactly the same...it is very similar to my own experience. That is where the story comes from. I watched the movie today for the first time since reading these comments, which Craig made about 7 years ago, and find that there are more similarities than he could have foreseen at the time. Part of the sharp satire on insider Hollywood revolves around getting a break because of whom you know. In the movie, Crawford comes to L.A. as a well-established hairstylist in Scotland (the Red Adair of hair), and manages to connect with the right people, beginning with Eamon the limo driver and Candy the publicist, which in turn leads to a series of connections with other key people and opportunities an amusement park animal costume fur-dressing gig, the continuing antagonistic yet crucial interactions with Monique and Stig, a lunch date with Drew Carey that takes Crawford's credibility to the next level, and a meeting with the Senator who finally allows him to compete in the W.H.I.F Hair-Off. Throughout these events and introductions, Crawford must pay his dues, often feeling humiliated in the process, yet always managing to make the best of the situation. I don't pretend to know all the details of Craig's rise to fame, but he was already an established comedian well-known in the U.K., then came to the U.S. and obscurity. After paying his dues here and there, he got a break as Mr. Wick on The Drew Carey Show. Drew Carey is the equivalent of Candy in this movie, giving stability to Craig's career, and enough required time on the set but not in front of the camera to begin writing, thus marking his breakthrough into the roles of writer, producer, and finally director with the critically acclaimed I'll Be There. Craig Ferguson's big break as host of CBS's The Late Late Show is similar to Crawford's walk-on success in the competition for the Platinum Scissors award. Craig has not yet been crowned the king of late-night, but I have a feeling that some of the other late-night hosts are feeling very much the same as the other three Hair-Off competitors, wondering, Who is this Scottish guy, and who could have guessed he had so much talent? One interesting scene in particular shows the obvious pride Crawford feels when he finally obtains his H.A.G. card, a pride which Craig will soon share when he obtains a U.S. passport upon becoming a citizen of his adopted country. The parallels to Craig's current situation are easy to see, and I think that The Big Tease may portend the huge success that Craig has yet to attain in Hollywood and with the ranks of late-night fans. Like Crawford, Craig is determined to reach the pinnacle of his profession, and he has forced industry insiders to sit up and take notice of him. Just like Crawford, Craig was born to this.

Filmed in a documentary style, which takes a few scenes to get used to, it really only hits its stride when the hero Crawford lands in the US.  From there it works very well, tilting at various American showbiz windmills.

Ferguson stars (and appears in virtually every scene) as a Scottish hairdresser who gets a letter inviting him to an international hair styling competition in Los Angeles.  This is cause for Langham to film a BBC documentary on him and much of the film is from that perspective (although Ferguson also narrates in blurbs filmed after the event.)  Falling somewhere in between the lame Drop Dead Gorgeous and the sublime Best in Show, the film is full of odd situations and the infectious charm of Ferguson as he sets out to win top honors.  Needless to say, if Ferguson weren't entertaining the film would be sunk.  Thankfully, he is delightful throughout.  Fisher, though less endearing, also provides nice support for him.  Several excellent comedic performers pop up along the way, notably the bizarre and side-splitting Miller as a harried hotel manager.  Rasche sinks humorously into his role as Ferguson's chief competitor.  McCormack, a very attractive young lady, perfectly captures the phony, insincere aspects of the contest organizer.  And any film that even briefly utilizes the untapped charms of McGinley can't be all bad.  Home video viewers may need to use subtitles to catch all of the remarks as the authentic Scottish accents are sometimes hard to completely understand.  Some real life hair professionals appear, but star cameos are minimal.  Carey inexplicably shows up as himself, but with a full head of hair.  Hasselhoff comes off amusingly as himself.  Crosby, an actress who always could have used a good stylist, appears briefly as a demonstration assistant.  One quibble  If the film was going to be rated R anyway, why not show more of the lead's physical assets.  What's shown is great, but all too brief.  On it's own little terms, this is a charming and fun movie.   "},{"Title":"A warm comedy romp.

Out of his hotel and out of money, Crawford tries to get into the competition and wins over the trend setters of Beverly Hills and, with a little bit of luck and deceit tries to work his way into the contestI had never heard of this film prior to it's TV premier in the UK, I imagine it's the same with a lot of people &#150; it's a British comedy but it never managed to get the same high profile as more notable successes.  However this is not to take from this film as it is pretty funny and gently amusing.  The plot is nonsense but I think that is the point &#150; it's is increasingly absurd &#150; just like the actual competition and Hollywood lifestyle that Crawford finds himself thrust into.  The comedy is rarely hilarious but it is consistently funny nonetheless &#150; being more amusing than rip-roaring.  The sheer wit and energy of the film manages to carry it over the odd dry spell.Ferguson is suitably flaming as Crawford and is sweetly na√Øve for the most part.  Langham is very dry as Samuels and I wanted him to have more screen time than he did &#150; many other mock-documentaries have successfully made much better use of the dry humour of the interviewer.  The support cast are good on the whole and don't mind making fun of themselves.  Rasche is good as the two-faced Stig.  While comedy cameos from Drew Carey and David Hasselhoff work well.  Miller is always value for money and is good in his brief scene.Overall this is a nice short little comedy that is lively and absurd.

And while the documentary style helps moves the story along (why waste time on character background when you can have a documentary filmmaker simply ask our hero a pointed question?), it also slows the story down at times.

Even as I checked the listing of credits here at IMDb, there are a few folks I saw in the film that are not listed.

Try as he might, he is told he cannot compete...and just to get rid of him, he's told that he has to be a member of the Hair Stylist Union to even be considered, and so his LA adventure begins.The film is fun as via documentary style we watch him run into everything LA has to give, including HIS hair styling idol who is a real snot!!

Well here, I'm happy to say, is a worthy addition to the shortlist of great mockumentaries.Craig Fergusen, best known for The Drew Carey Show and hosting The Late Show, co-wrote and starred in this fun romp intended to celebrate Scottish pride in the very in- Scottish world of Hollywood glitz. He plays Crawford Mackenzie, a flamboyant hair artiste who travels to L.A. for a celebrity hairstylist competition, but he soon ends up in a very bad hair day involving, but not limited to, dirty rival hairdressers, limo drivers of questionable character, drive-by shootings, snobby Hollywood promoters, snobby Hollywood hotel managers, snobby traffic cops, David Hasselhoff, hairdresser bureaucracies and basically every obstacle Hollywood can throw in the face of an aspiring artist.I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of Craig Fergusen, but I found this story to be so fun that I was able to put aside my Ferguphobia. It's a creative & funny premise, but what makes it brilliant is the way it mercilessly skewers the Hollywood machine for being the frustrating members-only-club that it is. And while such an undertaking could've easily turned cynical, The Big Tease manages to keep everything light-heartedly satirical and fun the whole way through. The comedy is pretty fast paced, and you might miss a few subtle gags upon first viewing; some quiet lines are so priceless you'll find yourself wanting to write them down. That's the mark of a well- written script.There's just one area where it fell short in my mind. This film has more than enough strength to stand as a straight mockumentary or reality show. But they decided to add occasional scenes of the character Crawford narrating the story. Seemingly done in post production, he sits on a staged set talking to the camera. To me, this was the one flaw of the movie because it upstages the documentarian by adding 2nd character who is now communicating directly with the audience, further breaking down that 4th wall. Although some of these scenes feature hilarious material, I felt like they interrupted the rhythm of this brisk comedy.That's really a very minor criticism, and it probably won't even bother you. Like I said, The Big Tease deserves its place of honor along the other rare but hilarious mockumentaries Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind (all by Christopher Guest), the obscure but riotously funny Sons of Provo (about a Mormon boy band composed of aging men) and the totally obscure but absolutely brilliant Aussie flick Razzle Dazzle (about a misfit team of young girls in a national dance competition).

In his own charming way Crawford embarks to Lotus Land thinking he's to represent Glasgow as a competitor but is soon informed by WHIF's oraganizer Monique Geingold (McCormack, who has the uncanny knack in being a real phony with comic aplomb) he was invited to be in the audience.  Not taking no for an answer the indefatigable Scotsman attempts to get his HAG card (that's Hairdressers of America Guild) by any means necessary even resorting to his competition, the pompous ass Nordic god of the salon set, Stig Ludwiggssen (Rasche, a good sport hooligan in a ridiculous hair extensioned wig), who dismisses him like a knot in one's hair.Adding some gumption and support to Mackenzie's starry-eyed quest is high powered Hollywood publicist Candy Harper (the wonderfully tart and no bull Fisher) who takes him under her wing after his attempt to get Sean Connery's phone number from her (he once helped the fellow Scot during a windy mishap with his toupee during a Benny Hill Pro/Am Golf outing) and instead gives her a sparkling makeover.. Ferguson - who is so good as the devilishly naughty Mr. Wick on the `Carrey' program  - at least gives the impression of having a good time onscreen (and it shows) which seems to bounce off nicely from his assembled cast including veteran stand up comic Miller as a recovering alcoholic manager of a posh Beverly Hills hotel (`I've been clean and sober for five.days'), McCormack - best known as Howard Stern's long-suffering wife in `Private Parts' - is a charming bitch with not one honest bone in her well manicured body, and Logue as a player wanna be limo driver is memorable.Funny in its execution but gradually losing its bearing in the climactic `hair off' - for a lack of a better term - the film's concept seems one note and often has the unkindly air of flop sweat with its too lingering shots on the desperate hair stylist in his dream becoming a nightmare.

This is done in the fake documentary form as Drop Dead Gorgeous was. The plots between the two movies were pretty similar, showing the competitive nature between the hair stylists or the beauty pageant contestants.Crawford Mackenzie (Craig Ferguson) is the up and coming gay hair stylist from Glasgow, Scotland who has received an invitation to compete in Los Angeles for the coveted Platinum Scissors award. Mackenzie is delighted and gets a documentary crew together to document the events, which, as you might assume, will get a little embarrassing to be documented. The first mishap to take place is the fact that his credit card has been maxed out, unexpected to Mackenzie because he believed the participants expenses were taken care of. Second, he finds out that he was not invited to compete, but to watch. That would be pretty embarrassing in itself, but Mackenzie takes it upon himself to earn his HAG card (Hairdressers of America Guild) so he can become eligible to compete.Stig Ludwiggssen (David Rasche, and the reason I rented the movie) is the main competition for Mackenzie and comes off as a pompous jerk, like Ted McGinley's character in Revenge Of The Nerds (who, coincidentally, is Stig's agent in The Big Tease).Also, Drew Carrey makes a cameo as himself, but with a full head of hair and raves about Mackenzie's work, which for some reason I found pretty funny. Between Drew's and Rasche's hair, I do not know which was more out of place. I am still used to remembering Rasche as the straight laced Sledge Hammer.Overall, a fun little movie if you do not go into it expecting much.

The problem with THE BIG TEASE is that the jokes are fairly weak and mainly revolve the old - And we`re talking so old they died of old age some time ago and the stench is overpowering - pratfall gags of people walking into sliding doors etcThere`s also directorial blunders too . Remember that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was a spoof documentary shot on a single video camera ? Then you`ll remember that every single scene was shot on a single video camera . With THE BIG TEASE it`s obvious the documentary crew only have one camera but in nearly every single scene there`s cross cuts long shots etc which prove there`s several different cameras used to shoot the movie . Yeah I`m nit-picking for sure but I`ve never been a fan of mockumentaries , hell I didn`t even like THIS IS SPINAL TAP that much For neutrals who have never heard of Craig Ferguson you might find THE BIG TEASE amusing if you see it on TV ( It was ten times more entertaining than the alleged comedy film the BBC showed last night entitled THE WEDDING TACKLE ) but I doubt you`d want to spend money hiring it at the video shop   "}{"Title":"Not particularly funny, not particularly entertaining, not particularly anything","Date":"22 April 2005","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" When I sat down to see this film, I expected a mix of Drop Dead Gorgeous and The Drew Carey Show(because of it being a mockumentary and it starring Craig Ferguson whom I know mainly from that show). I don't know exactly to describe what I got instead. The humor seems fairly thin, and based on clich√©s and stereotypes I never even knew existed. The gags and jokes don't seem as silly-funny or stupid-funny as... not funny at all. I understand Ferguson wrote the script, at least in part. I don't know if he's to blame for the shoddy writing and poor humor, but I would guess so. The film has a few celebrity cameos, but they're really there to bring even more bad jokes and make fun of themselves. The plot is fairly good, and somewhat original, but quickly descends into yet another fish-out-of-water run-of-the-mill happy-ending fairy tale about some guy triumphing over adversity. The pacing is awful... the film barely seems to move at all during the less than 90 minute running time. The acting is fair. The characters are all paper-thin, with everyone whose side we're supposed to be on being goody-goody and their enemies being caricatures of bad people. Weirdest thing about this film is... for the first half or so, it seemed pretty funny. Larry Miller was great fun to watch, as was Donal Logue. From there on end, it just went downhill. I don't know, other people might enjoy it. Maybe I'm just not into Ferguson's humor. I recommend this to fans of Craig Ferguson and possibly one or more of the other comedians/comic actors in it. If you happen to catch it and you enjoy Miller's typical act in films, you should at least watch until the end of his scenes. He is one of the few redeeming features of the film. 5/10 "}]
