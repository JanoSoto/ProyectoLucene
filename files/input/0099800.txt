Than look no further, because writer/director Reginald Hudlin has made not only one of the best Afro-Americans based film. But also one of the most copied haircuts in recent history.Play(Christopher Martin) is having this banging HOUSE PARTY with buddy Bilal(Martin Lawrence) DJing. But their best friend Kid(Christopher Reid) can't go because he's Pops(Robin Harris in a terrific performance) grounded him. So he sneaks out to join the party, but face neighborhood bullies(Full Force) and the fact that two girls(Tisha Campbell & A.J. Johnson) like him and wants him to choose between them.The dance scenes are amazing and the songs are still hype. The acting is great, especially by the late Robin Harris, who will have you laughing at every scene he's in. And George Clinton's cameo is absolutely funny as hell. So enjoy the movie that gave birth to HOW HIGH, SOUL PLANE, and of course CLASS ACT in some ways.

The new jack swing was at its peak and this movie sums it up. It became a break-through for then young actors Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell. This reminds me of the time when I was a teenager who wanted to sneak out to go to a party and later got caught. I was in the 10th grade when this movie was released and I had a lot of fun during that time with not too much fighting at parties. The bullies played by the R&B group Full Force made the movie more funny with its slapstick humor and the memorable Robin Harris with his witty punchlines. It's sad to see him leave this earth at an early age,and comedian Bernie Mac reminds me of him. I remember he died the weekend of this movie and this was a shock. He could have been one of the funniest comedians in the 90s but his life was put to a halt and made way for several comedians who are now today's superstars (namely from Def Comedy Jam). House Party also remind me of how fun hip-hop was,and back then hip-hop was political,educational,radical,and uplifting. This movie can go down in history as how African-Americans can enjoy themselves with no use of drugs and unprotected sex.

Kid and Play make one of the first hip hop films of the nineties which had a plot. Many young black comedic actors got their start in this film like Martin Lawerence and AJ Johnson. But the true comedic talent in the film is the late Robin Harris. The world only knows what Harris could have done. The script is smart and the direction by Regiland Hudlin is good.

(spoilers)","Date":"30 January 2005","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" Oddly serving as the thesis film for director Reginald Hudlin while a student at Harvard, 'House Party' is one of my favorite teen comedies. Although, clearly most of the cast (especially Martin Lawrence and the members of Full Force) who were clearly somewhere in their late 20s, if not early 30s. However, this is one all-black teen comedy which did things with just the right amount of spunk, and the characters were not so obnoxious and not so stereotypical that you couldn't enjoy their (mis)adventures.Old school rappers, Kid and Play, are two high school friends. Play is hosting a house party when his folks go out of town and his number one mate, Kid, plans on making an appearance. But, after getting into a scuffle with one of the bullies (aka, the biggest muscles from Full Force), he gets suspended. Like Les Anderson hoping his parents won't find out that he flunked his driver exam in 'License to Drive,' Kid prays that his father won't find out about his getting in trouble at school because he desperately wants to go that party.But, more importantly, there is a great mix of subplots interacting which make this movie quite entertaining, especially the idiotic white cops that seem to appear at the most inconvenient moments (and not appear at the convenient ones) to harass the neighborhood and Kid's father (stand-up comedian, Robin Harris) making his way to the house party to bring his son home. And get a load of those clothes and dancing! For fans of old school rap and hip-hop the nostalgia trip alone should be reason enough to watch it. And, though several House Party sequels would follow, the first two are really the only ones worth watching.

The be-all and end-all of House Parties. Where they can let their personal freak flags fly. Where a good time will most certainly be had by all.And they basically do.In a lurid blur of motion and colour these attractive teens set about enjoying themselves in the most PG 13 ways imaginable.For a 15 year old this was like opening a window to another world the outlandish gravity defying haircuts that I envied but would never dare attempt. The stoopid (in a good way) rhymes and dumb (in a hopelessly dated now) phrases spouted by these fly guys and home girls were new and dangerously addictive, if terribly out of place in the small town I grew up.Shennanigans were plentiful, but amounted to little more than messin' playfully with the man in blue, freaking the establishment and clearly exposing the gaping generation gap by juxtaposing these carefully manicured teens against the pompous and staid older types.Characters are broad and never less than frenetic and loud, dialogue makes little sense but sure sounds fresh and exciting.And boy are these kids budding model citizens.Overindulgence of alcohol is frowned upon, but with a supportive message of limitation rather than abhorrence. Violence is for punks and drugs aren't even mentioned. Sex is OK but only when 'safe' and amenable to both parties, no 'c'mon baby, you know you want it' here.And there is an anti-prison sex rap. Finally someone stands up against it! Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 / 10. House Party spawned several sequels, none of which I even vaguely recall. But this 90 minutes is always likable and elicits warm memories of my teens (not that I acted like this, but I watched a lot of movies where characters did).

He is constantly under the watchful eye of his frustrated, over-protective father who is also a widow, and Kid has no girlfriend. But fortunately his life would get better for at school that day his friend, Play Martin, was organizing a huge house party he would be throwing at his house while his parents were out of town. Their friend Bilal would be the DJ. Kid was definitely in. They also invite two beautiful girls, Sidney and Sharane. Unfortunately while Kid was talking to them, he accidentally bumped into Stab, the meanest boy in school. Stab calls Kid's recently deceased mother a 'ho and then a fight breaks out. Kid and Stab are brought before the principal who says she will notify Kid's father. Kid was worried because he knew for sure his father would say no to the party if he found out Kid got in trouble at school again. Luckily there was no letter for phone call from school when he got home. So all looked well until that evening when Pops received a telegram from the school. Well that did it. He told Kid that he was forbidden to go the party; Bilal and his equipment waited on Bilal's porch for Play to pick them up. Pretty soon Play drove up with his girlfriend, LaDonna. Play managed to jam all the equipment into his little car, even though the record players and speakers were scratched up and chipped pretty bad. But now there was no room in the car for Bilal, so Play decided to come back for him, much to Bilal's chagrin.Later that night, Kid crept out of the house while Pops was asleep and headed for the party. Unfortunately, Pops wasn't quite asleep. En route to the party, Kid was harassed by two inept, wayward, fascist cops, Boyd and Warraski. Not only that, but Kid also runs afoul of Stab and his cohorts Zilla and Pee-Wee. They give chase. Kid hides in the backyard of a very boring party. But with help from the DJ, George Clinton, Kid manages to speed up the party. Stab, Zilla and Pee- Wee arrive then. So do Officers Boyd and Warraski. Fortunately nobody at the party pressed charges but the officers felt it was their civic duty to publicly humiliate the boys before letting them go; Play finally returns to pick up Bilal who decided not to go to the party until he saw all the beautiful girls in the back of Play's car. The party was already underway by the time everybody arrived. Play's friends Groove, Chill, Clinton, Benita, La Shay, Herman, and more. Sidney and Sharane were there too. It was to be the biggest house party the block had ever seen. This annoyed the neighbor next door who called the feds; Kid and Play have a rap contest to one another. Kid really played Play. Bilal wanted to dance with Sidney, but she refused because she said Bilal had bad breath. She wouldn't even dance with Kid or Play. But Sharane did; Stab, Zilla and Pee-Wee arrive then. Play does not allow them into the party and Kid taunts them from inside. Stab grabs a can of gasoline and decides to burn the house down. Luckily before he got the fire started, Officers Boyd and Warraski arrive then. The jig was up.Pops Robinson headed out to look for Kid. He was also stopped by Boyd and Warraski. But they left when he told them he was from a town called Fresh Off A Cop's 'arse' and was feeling home sick. Pops soon arrives at Play's house. Fortunately Kid was upstairs with Sharane (who was getting her coat). Sidney didn't let him upstairs, so Pops went home to wait for his son; Kid walks Sharane and Sidney home. He doesn't get very far with Sharane, and Sidney didn't want to rush into a relationship. However five minutes later they were up in the bedroom. While they worried about birth control, Sidney's parents came home. Kid escaped but was soon left at the mercy of Stab, Zilla and Pee-Wee, who had just gotten back from being victims of police brutality. They give chase. Kid hides in an old refrigerator (don't try this at home!) The wayward cops return and arrest all four of them. In the jail cell, Kid calls Play and asks him to bail him out, and quickly, as Kid's cellmates eyed him hungrily; Play was very frustrated with the party's results, because on top of everything, someone broke his toilet! But together with Bilal, they got some money together to bail Kid out of jail. Sidney and Sharane even helped. At the jail, Kid managed to delay his cellmates with a rap song. Finally he is bailed out. They drop Sidney and Sharane off at home, then Kid is dropped off. He crept back into the house and just as he was climbing into bed, there stood Pops... Belt in hand.House Party is a pretty funny movie. It ISN'T a stoner film, like it may sound. Nobody uses drugs in the movie. Heck, nobody even smokes a cigarette. That's good. I don't even recall if there was any alcohol. This was one of the good kind of parties. Rap artists Christopher Reid and Christopher Martin are Kid 'N Play, as credited. Fellow rap artists Paul Anthony, B-Fine and Bow-Legged Lou play Stab, Zilla and Pee-Wee. Robin Harris plays Pops and unfortunately, he has passed away. He died in mid-1990 after completing this film. Too bad, because he was very good. House Party was followed by many sequels. House Party 2 in 1991, House Party 3 in 1994, and House Party 4 in 2001. I wonder if there will be a House Party 5. If so, I'm sure a lot of TODAY'S fine rap artists will be in it. But for right now, I recommend y'all check out House Party! It's dope! It's hip! It's the hype. It's ALL THAT. Know what I'm sayin'? Oh, and Martin Lawrence is here too! So you know it's good! He was banned from SNL. So check out House Party! There's actually not as much pervasive language as you might expect. It is pretty tame for its particular genre.

And what a crummy cinema it was....the Mandolin in Sydney was the mangy red velvet 60s beatnik cinema that was a converted 1930s radio theater. Perfect! I think that night we went to the movies and saw Kid'n'Play's HOUSE PARTY and appropriately went to an all night dance party in a warehouse nearby with 5000 others who secretly knew it was on (yes 5000 others) and like in HOUSE PARTY, you had to know it was on in there.... so we got to see the movie and cross/culture/shift and relive the experience to the same music. HOUSE PARTY like that night is a moment in time, part of the hilarious reckless nights we have all had in the late 80s (see the great tiny1982 indie Oz pic GOING DOWN for proof) ... to new music with hilarious friends and dance tracks that allowed you to dance with 15 different people. I know there were sequels but by then the time had gone and the dance parties were full of bad drugs and bonehead behavior. HOUSE PARTY is the bookend to PARTY MONSTER.. the incredible lavish and absolutely bullseye moment of the 90s captured on film in 2003 with Macauley Culkin and Seth Green. It would be horrifying fun to see these films together in one sitting to identify the night it started and the night it stopped. I suppose it is the same idea wondering how we got from I Wanna Hold Your Hand to When I Think Of You I Touch Myself. Yes HOUSE PARTY is the innocent side of the coke chopping razor and PARTY MONSTER is the harsh sunlight of next morning.

We don't get many of these classic, retro, 80's and 90's style black movies anymore like we used too. The latest one that crosses my mind at the moment is the recent Lottery Ticket that, judging from the film's trailer, has the style, humor, and looks of a Friday film (with Ice Cube not as Craig) and some other similarities I won't dig into at this time. Though it undoubtedly wont surpass the humor brought by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker in the 1995 Comedy, it will most likely bring cute one liners and have an essence of the feeling while being it's own thing.Kid 'n Play and DJ Jazzy Jeff/The Fresh Prince were icons and the rap duos way back in the 80's 90's. They are the true definition of hip-hop with their amusing, yet cheesy music videos, and energetic beats combined with clever lines in their songs. We even get the memorable and respectable rap battle between Kid n' Play which is the film's ultimate turn for the best. We get some of the most fluent rhymes and a beat (composed by Martin Lawrence) to satisfy as well. It's definitely the most energetic point in the film and without the had the most thought put into it.Kid n' Play play are themselves with a simple plot amongst them. Kid wants to go to a party held by Play, but after a run in with the school bully, his father Pops (played by the late Robin Harris, whom died nine days after the release of the film) prevents him from going and makes him remain in the house all night. Kid sneaks out and heads to Play's party in hopes of having his way with the girl, or girls, of his dreams. The one thing in the way of his dreams is the school bully and his two goons trying to make Kid sorry for his accidental run in in the lunch room.It's a simple story, but to my surprise, the movie is not all about the house party as the title, cover, and storyline would suggest. It's actually a heartfelt, meaningful story about friendship, love, and doing what you think is right. When introduced to Kid we are given the misleading impression he is a goodie-goodie kid with nothing on his mind that would ever lead to trouble. Instead when the movie picks up we learn Kid's wild side and the antics never stop when they start.Another thing very cool about this film are the colors. Bright, vibrant texture is put to the test here and the colorful and artistic blend work well in creating a very unique setup. Also with the classic hip-hop tracks constantly played in the movie, it's almost feels like one 100 minute musical/music video, since most videos back in the 90's had a cheesy, colorful set with energetic music and a track with sensible lyrics. Overall, House Party is definitely a party. With the all star African American cast, enjoyable songs, vibrant colors, and a retro feeling to top it off, it's the ultimate party movie, and Kid n' Play are the icing on the cake.Starring Christopher Kid Reid, Christopher Play Martin, Full Force, Martin Lawrence, A.J. Johnson, Tisha Campbell,, and Daryl Chill Mitchell.

It helped to create more positive images of young black teens rather than showing the more negative aspects. Most of the films about young blacks up until then had been about them either being in gangs or on drugs. At least in this film you see the kids getting into mischief without getting into any real trouble. However, the only negative thing I have to say about the film is not about the film itself, but about the seemingly endless series of sequels that seemed to follow. To me the only the first film should be seen and not the sequels because they pretty much undermined the quality of the first film. Also, the series almost seemed to become an African-American version of the Beach Party films, where there pretty much was no plot and just gave the actors an excuse to party. Other than that, this is still a good film.Another note about this film. The thing that really stood out about the film was the performance of comedian Robin Harris as Kid's father. His performance pretty much helped to sell the film for me. Unfortunately, a few months after the film was released Harris died from an apparent heart attack at the much too young age of 36 and just as he was about to achieve stardom. So, this film, while enjoyable, is also a very bittersweet experience.

Groove and Chill were hilarious, but John Witherspoon's character, Mr. Strickland, was the funniest. Too bad he only showed up for a few minutes. The sequels suck.

I loved the characters, especially KID, and POPs. Pops made me laugh every time he spoke. He would mumble to himself all sorts of things, even if they had nothing to do with what was going on. I don't know if I like this movie more because I'm black or if anyone would like it. I know it made me laugh. I give this film a 9 out of 10.

Upon finishing this film, I did a bit of research on it and discovered that this pioneer film (prior to the sequels) was actually a favorite among Sundance goers in 1990. Apparently it racked up quite a bit of awards in the drama category. While I must say that it was enjoyable to go back to this type of cinema, you know, the parents are away so the kids will play scenario, but I didn't think this was the best this genre had to offer. Director Reginald Hudlin created this film for his thesis at Harvard as well as a benchmark for DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Price, so how did he finally end up with Kid & Play? While I did think that Kid did a decent job with his character, which couldn't have been too far from himself, Play offered nothing new to the film. Martin Lawrence continued to be the most annoying character in the film, while the love interests were clichéd from the start. The music was fun, the dancing was laughable, and the police officers were racist &#133; so does that make for Sundance winning cinema? Personally, there were elements that needed tightened and some that were great the way they were. It wasn't the best film, but House Party did provide for an hour and a half of dusty memories.The characters were both a high point and the low point of the film. House Party is a classic example of great starting characters that eventually dwindle away before the film officially ends. I thought that Kid did a decent job of being a humorous element, while Play coupled with Martin Lawrence's character were just overly annoying. I couldn't get attached to either of them. It was obvious that Lawrence was working towards his character for his television show Martin throughout this entire film. If you watch his television show and this film you will draw similar comparisons. Play cannot act, and throughout this film it becomes apparently clear that his only true talent was acting because he even looses in the infamous rap competition. Tisha Campbell and AJ Johnson couldn't have been more cliché. I say this with the warmest sympathies, but their characters had no depth, no originality, and carried nothing more than eye candy for the two male leads. Women are handed these roles all the time, there are some that stand forward and say that they demand characters with more personality, but then you also have women like this that needed the paycheck. Thinking back on the cast of this film, I do believe that Hudlin could have put more thought into everyone. If you first pick is not available, there is no need to immediately jump to the bottom of the barrel. Be patient, the best could be right in front of you. The film is worth watching for Kid, his expression in his eyes and face is immaculate, but for the rest, I have watched commercials with better character development.What about this story? The story was an extremely simple set up. High schoolers trying to go out on a school night to the dance party of the century get caught up in a web of trouble only to discover that what they think is important to them isn't necessarily true. Also, true love lurks around the corner in the darkest of spaces. Does this sound like a familiar Hollywood recycled plot to you? To me it does, but what this film does which takes it out of the recycle bin category is the urban themes that Hudlin ignites. While I thought that your typical film would have centered on a love affair, this urban film instead revolved around Kid trying to be a better lyricist. While some will argue that love is the central focus of this film, I saw his desire to be a better performer to the ultimate moment for our character. In nearly all of his scenes he is attempting to finally be the best at his rap game, and finally, even in the jail cell, he proves that he can handle himself with the best. I liked this focus. I liked seeing Kid evolve throughout the film. What I didn't like, and thought was completely trashy, was the racial undertones that Hudlin threw in the mix. The white police officer jokes were not funny. I thought the point where they took the bullies to the docks and beat them was completely uncalled for and ruined the light tone of this film. Was that funny? This reviewer wasn't laughing at all.Overall, I thought this was a decent film. I have no doubt in my eyes that the sequels that were spun do not carry the overall excitement that was conveyed in this first film, but for now, House Party was a light, enjoyable film that christened a new range of actors into the Hollywood circuit. Could one safely say that this was the first film to introduce rappers as actors? I haven't seen enough films to make that assumption, but I wouldn't mind making a wager. This is a historical film, but not one that can be watched over and over again. The language seemed a bit strong for the levity of the film, but outside of the key points where Hudlin failed (Lawrence role, white officers, cliché women), I thought that this film quietly fell into place by the end. It reminded me of some of the Feldman/Haim match-ups with an urban flair.Grade *** out of ***** "},{"Title":"If you're still jiggy with hip-hop, see this movie.","Date":"8 March 1999","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":"  This definitely deserves a spot in the cult classic category. A truckload of jiggy dialogue would have greater impact on serving to a limited audience without mass hysteria. The funny moments ensue the lack of horrid raunchiness, making this aged film a step above CAN'T HARDLY WAIT. I hate to go back to the first time I entered high school. That's when hair-dos styled inches high made life miserable. HOUSE PARTY is good if you like to go back to those wild days. It isn't bad for the comedy, for which Kid & Play did best at it. Just don't complain about the expensive power bill that shows up after you've wasted a good 100+ minutes on a relic that been way past its prime.  "}]
