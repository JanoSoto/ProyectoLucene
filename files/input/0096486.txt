The plot involves Yahoo Serious splitting beer atoms, inventing the electric violin and the surfing board, running into the cute Marie Curie and having a very bad hair day, and is of course full of anachronisms and other factual errors.But does that really matter? No, of course not. This movie takes a very light and novel approach to making a movie about science. Not all the jokes are good. In fact, most are pretty bad. But at least most of them are original. And the parts were Young Einstein explains some concepts of relativity are great ! The only explanation I can give for the low rating this movie currently has is that most people simply don't understand the jokes. If you don't know what splitting an atom is, and if you don't know that beer-atoms are none-existent, then you probably hate this movie.

Yahoo Serious is awesomely gifted and, thankfully for us, independent in his creations.  This is NOT a movie hacked out by bored corporate committee members filling in quotas of stupid juvenile formulas.  This isn't a spoof, either.

Serious' character performance is superbly charming and funny, and the rest of the film is filled with great acting, but it's the visuals that impress most, it's really quite astounding that such great production values could go into such a non-mainstream film, and be used so effectively.

For instance the invention of Rock 'n Roll serves to feed a great theme in movie.  Albert Einstein is a genius far ahead of his time and his attempts to introduce Rock 'n Roll and electric instruments serve to illustrate that genius is often not only misunderstood but completely unappreciated.  This is in fact one of the major themes of the film - his parents don't understand him, the scientist with Marie Currie, and her teacher simply don't understand him or his theories. This film's wonderful scenery, marvellous sets, and fantastic camera work often give the impression of an extremely expensive film.  However this film was anything but!

I have seen this film dozens of times now, on cable and in little art house theatres, and it always makes me laugh and gets my spirits a little bit up.

Just DONT BOTHER,. "},{"Title":"Lame","Date":"8 September 2000","Score":"2 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, History","Review":"  This movie will only appeal to five year old's. It is so lame, and completely dated by now, that it can only be seen as a historical document. The sound effects are so over used, you will scream 'shut up!' at it. Serious needs to go to comedy school for a couple of years, for he needs to learn that a lizard that makes a dinosaur noise isn't funny, and that being literally kicked out of somewhere and accompanied by a voice saying and stay out! isn't funny. There have been a lot of great Australian films, and this isn't one of them. I kind of feel a bit sorry for Yahoo Serious, I mean, anyone will a name like that has to have issues in the 'being funny' department. 3/10. "}]
