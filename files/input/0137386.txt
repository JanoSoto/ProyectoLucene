The comedy, directed by Tommy O'Haver never goes for cheap shots. The story of this somewhat naive photographer trying to make it in Los Angeles, under another writer/director would have gone for the 'on your face' attitude, rather than give it the romantic tone Tommy O'Haver imparted on the movie.The performances are good. Sean Hayes, who has gone to bigger and better things, is fine as Billy, the photographer. Brad Rowe, as Gabriel, the object of Billy's love, is fine also. Best of all is Meredith Scott Lynn, a fine actress, who is the best asset of this movie. Her Georgina serves to tie all the different plots, and in doing so, she contributes to make the film better. Paul Bartel, Holly Woodlawn and the rest, do a fine job.Tommy O'Haver made a charming movie about people that are so normal they could be straight for all we know.

But Hayes receives mixed signals from the object of his desire - is he gay, or isn't he? - which leads to complications of the heart...Described as a 'trifle' by writer-director Tommy O'Haver (ELLA ENCHANTED), this unassuming confection asks little more of its audience than to enjoy the scenery (both geographical and human!) and to pine along with its luckless protagonist as he pursues the hunk of his dreams. Those familiar with Hayes' outrageous turn in TV's Will & Grace may be disappointed by his restraint as a bland, scatterbrained idealist who learns the hard way that the course of true love never ran smoothly, especially in LA. Spiced with dream sequences that recreate moments from Hollywood's 'golden age' (most impressively, an Astaire-Rogers dance routine between Hayes and Rowe to the strains of Petula Clark, with drag queens on backing vocals!), the film pays affectionate tribute to the movies of a bygone era, movies which inspire the leading character on his never-ending quest for perfect happiness. Watch out for the magical scene in which Hayes and Rowe share a bed for purely platonic reasons, only to end up touching each other by 'accident'...Also starring Meredith Scott Lynn (STANDING ON FISHES), Richard Ganoung (PARTING GLANCES), Paul Bartel (EATING RAOUL), Carmine D.

His portrayal of Billy is low-key & pensive. He's adorable (instead of obnoxious & swishy) with a little boy twinkle in his eyes. Billy is a photographer from Indiana who has relocated to Los Angeles. He comes across a waiter/bass player (Brad Rowe as Gabriel, a character I'm not too crazy about) working in a coffee shop, who becomes his model & the object of his affection. Supposedly, Gabriel is straight & has a girlfriend in San Francisco. The sexual tension between these two can be cut with a knife (it's nerve wracking.) I especially like the scenes where Billy opens up to Gabriel about his life & experiences. Telling him the types of things you'd only share with someone you truly feel connected to. Is Gabriel gay??

Before the movie was over, I was online buying the DVD. O'Haver must have summoned all his Indy Film clout to muster the likes of Paul Ganoung, Meredith Scott Lynn and the fabulous Paul Bartel to lend their talents both on and off the camera, but the coup of coups was casting Sean Hayes. Hayes is superb as Billy, a struggling gay photographer yearning for love. He falls for Gabriel (Brad Rowe) who may or may not be gay. The rest of the film dances around the inevitable question and let's just say that things have a way of working out for the best, albeit differently from what we often expect.Actor, writer, director and absolute gay icon Paul Bartel, who unfortunately passed away a couple of years after Screen Kiss, is deliciously unctuous as a would be mentor. Brad Rowe is passable, if a little lightweight, and benefits immeasurably from his co-star. Sean Hayes, even before the runaway success of Will and Grace, demonstrates the comedic genius that steals almost every scene. Spliced throughout the movie are several numbers by Mr. Dan, a notable drag artist and promoter from L.A., and as Petula Clark he helps generate the sheer joy of watching this movie. If you remember Lou Reed's classic Take a Walk on the Wild Side you may enjoy watching Holly Woodlawn (Holly came from Miami F-L-A - yes THAT Holly) as the party hostess.The DVD commentary is worthwhile, and offers an inside view of the resourcefulness it takes to make a good indie film. It does not detract from the importance of BHSK that it is not an original film. O'Haver had been toying with the basic story idea since his earlier Catalina, but in BHSK the story is more fully developed and humorous. Touching, moving, gentle and risqu√©, an uplifting and life-affirming message wrapped in a carnival of Angelean queer decadence.

Whether you're gay or straight (although, I suspect, particularly if you're a gay man), you're bound to see yourself on the screen more than once.  Billy (Sean P. Hayes) rushes headlong to a place where we've all gone before, a place where angels fear to tread the Territory of Unrequited Affection.  We've all been there; we've all done it.  The desire and need for emotional as well as physical intimacy is a great and terrible thing, and Billy's struggle is one we can identify with while still seeing the humor inherent in our own all-too-human endeavors.  Bright, cheerful cinematography makes the most of the distinctly L.A. locations (West Hollywood, Catalina Island).  Gentle, tender, funny, for the most part honest, and not a diatribe--which meant that I could recommend it to my straight friends, too.

The bedroom scene is the best acted, best scripted, best directed moment in the whole film, done with rare sensitivity and acting skill by both. It culminates in nothing, which is what one feels by the time the movie has come to its disappointing finale. Nothing really new has opened up food for thought.By turns, sad, wistful, funny, irreverent, with a cast full of what we call misfits (and rather shallow ones at that), it fails to do anything more than pass the time as the kind of interesting little gay trifle that gains sympathy for Sean Hayes' character. At the same time one can't help being irritated by his hopelessly romantic character molded by the tacky romantic films he grew up on. Makes its point by having strains from Max Steiner's Now, Voyager as part of the background score.Certainly not for everyone, but amusing enough to please fans of SEAN HAYES who will no doubt like seeing him in a more restrained role than the gay man he played on Will and Grace. He does well in the part. BRAD ROWE is a bit stiff as his fair-haired dreamboy (and would-be lover), lacking the ability to create any sympathy at all for his character by the film's end. He's really too bland to care about.Darkly handsome JASON-SHANE SCOTT as Brad might have been a better choice for Rowe's key role since he shows considerable more dramatic ability in a minor part as well as the model looks required.

The story revolves around Billy (Sean Hayes) and his infatuation with a seemingly straight man named Gabriel (Brad Rowe) who he meets at a coffee shop and convinces to do some modeling. Before long a more famous photographer on the L.A. scene, Rex Webster (Paul Bartel) is threatening to swoop down and take him away from Billy before he gets to finish his photo shoot.Much of the film is consumed with Billy's self-doubt about his relationship with Gabriel &#150; is he merely engaging in fantasy projection of his desire onto an apparently straight man (who assures us at every opportunity that he has a girlfriend in San Francisco) or has he fallen in love with the improbably handsome busboy? There are some moments of slight humor but nothing that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the characters just became obnoxious to me, particularly Billy's straight friend Georgiana (Meredith Scott Lynn) who for unexplained reasons spends time with a very very obnoxious drug addict musician type on Catalina Island. The drug addict character is an example of how the film tried to woo favor with the straight audience by projecting its unfavorable stereotyped images onto select straight characters and allowing the other straight characters to join in on ridiculing those characters' behavior along with the gay characters.I mostly watched the film to see Paul Bartel, honestly, and his work was fine here but not exceptional. There wasn't anything distinctive enough about the character, a sort of hackneyed artist/queen, that would have enabled Bartel to show much of his talent. Since this was one of Bartel's last roles that's kind of disappointing.I did enjoy Hayes' work, I thought it was fine within the limits of what he was given for the character.Not really a terrible movie but really just not funny enough to be worth it.

Good acting by all the actors and quite funny. It's a nice light tale of Billy who loves to produce his own art in the form of polaroids.  He falls in love with the guy that he asks to be his model for his first REAL photo shoot.  The model is supposedly straight but is breaking up with his girlfriend and seems to be slowly opening up to Billy and his lifestyle.  Billy thinks he can have him but isn't sure if he's gay or not.  Finally they get together but it's the model's first time and it falls through.  He loses the model to a bigger shoot by another photo artist.  The model goes to Catalina Island and Billy and others are invited (sort of) to the party afterwards.  Billy chases after his model love just to find that his model has fallen in love with someone else.  He also discovers that one of his best friends has loved him from afar for sometime but he never knew it.  At the end he finally get's his photos seen at a show and another friend introduces him to someone else that loves his work and you can see that he is probably headed for love again and you leave the movie feeling that he is going to live happily ever after with the new friend.I feel the movie is great because it takes a situation than we've all seen many times in movies about heterosexuals and switches it to the gay life. The nice thing is it shows that this is normal everyday life for anyone; gay or straight.   Anyone could see this and love it gay or straight if they just watch it for what it is.  This is not (in my opinion) a gay movie; it is a movie about they everyday life of anyone who's out there looking for love.  The film maker simply showed that everyday life includes gays as well.  Sure it centered around a gay man but it DID NOT center around gay life.  It centered around LIFE.  Period!  )  I'm pleased with this film on many levels but the fact that it shows that everyone goes through the same thing and has the same feelings regardless of whether they are gay or straight is my favorite thing about this film.

In an example of what has become typical of gay cinema, the characters are allowed to say they're gay but not to BE GAY. They have gay impulses, but are not allowed to act upon them. These movie-gays are in the same closet as James Coco's actor from 1981's Only When I Laugh (who tossed off lines about painting his toenails and cruising Central Park, but never got to flirt with another man on-screen). Some viewers might say this is fine with them--perhaps they don't wish to see two men being intimate--but, unfortunately, writer-director Tommy O'Haver never gives audiences a chance to decide (he's too busy evading the issue and hedging his bets). Tellingly, the most vivacious character in the whole film is a straight woman (fetchingly played by Meredith Scott Lynn) and the only man-to-man kiss on display is played for a cheap laugh.

There seems to be no point to the plot because the story is just as thin and shallow as the lead characters. At the end of the movie I found myself wondering what the heck it was all about anyway. Was this a story about friendship, lust, and falling in love? Was it about Gabriel's confusion about his sexual identity? Was it all about Billy's life as a long-suffering and hopeless romantic in search of the elusive Mr. Right? Or was it a tale about a never-to-be romance between two unbelievably hollow people? I suspect the screenwriter attempted to do a combination of all of the above and simply failed to come up with a smoother and more logical ending.Brad Rowe plays the role of the handsome hunk Gabriel, a painfully stereotypical butch-boy character that most gay men can only fantasize about. At First Gabriel seems to be a really cool, down-to-earth, nice, charming, sensitive, and sweet guy. But he, quite predictably, turns out to be an insensitive, flake who toys with the emotions of his rather average-looking admirer, Billy, a gay victim-of-unrequited-love stereotype played quite well by Sean Hayes.All through the movie, Gabriel keeps us guessing about his sexuality, from his troubled relationship with his girlfriend (whom we never see), to his homoerotic lead-ons with Billy (especially in the bedroom scene), and to his hanging out with a really goodlooking guy and girl at the Catalina sioree. Billy eventually convinces himself that Gabriel is probably questioning his own sexuality and extends a hand of friendship to help him come to terms those feelings. But the cold and unfeeling Gabriel then tells Billy that he was never unsure about what he wanted at all, and he walks away hugging his gorgeous model boyfriend whom he had apparently been seeing all along, leaving Billy standing on the beach. Now, that was cold! At the end of the movie we want to feel sorry for Billy, his having been dumped by Gabriel for a super goodlooking guy. But it is unfair to say that Gabriel dumped Billy because they were never really 'together' in the first place. It just doesn't make any sense that Gabriel made such an effort to befriend Billy and to lead him on the way he did, unless he was interested in being more than just platonic friends, or, at least, in platonic friendship, albeit with an undertone of homoeroticism. But, the way Gabriel discarded Billy during that beach scene made it clear that he wasn't really interested in Billy's friendship at all. Something is missing here, and it is the key that would explain Gabriel's transition from being a nice guy to the son-of-a b*tch that he turned out to be. Did he ever really have a girlfriend, or was that just a lie he made up to keep Billy at bay? Was Gabriel's 'girlfriend' really the dark-haired guy that he eventually ended up with? Did Gabriel ever even like Billy as a friend, or did he just use Billy as a means to get the modeling contract and the Catalina shoot? Unfortunately, the movie ends without even attempting to explain it.Notwithstanding, as much as we like Billy, its difficult to muster any empathy for him because he's really a victim of his own superficial fixation on having a prettyboy stereotype for a boyfriend. This begs the question is it really so that lonely gay men like Billy are doomed to a life of singleness because they can't find Mr. Right. Or, is the singleness self-imposed because they're holding out for fantasy stereotypes like Gabriel? Unfortunately for the producers of this film, they've successfully made a statement in support the latter argument.I give this movie 3 stars out of ten. It could have been a lot better.

While out for coffee with straight girlfriend Meredith Scott Lynn (as George, short for Georgiana), Hayes admires model-perfect waiter Brad Rowe (as Gabriel). Hayes is stricken. Later, he meets Mr. Rowe at a shallow party and offers the young hunk a job modeling for a series of photographs he's taking of beautiful young men kissing drag queens...Not to put this film too far down, but it fails if we're supposed to question whether or not Rowe's character might be gay or bisexual. It could be that what writer-director Tommy O'Haver conveys is Hayes' insecurity and/or fear of rejection. Even the declaration I have a girlfriend in San Francisco, seems like an invitation. We do want Hayes and Rowe to get together, so the story can be disappointing if they don't. Also, it may be difficult to feel sorry for a guy who slips out of bed with one attractive lover and appears to be headed for another, just because he doesn't get the one in between...There is not much on-screen sex in Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, as Mr. O'Haver reveals in the opening. That's not bad in itself, but we know there would be a lot more shown if the story focused on a man and a woman. Consequently, our suspicion that both Hayes and Rowe prefer to be sexually passive (with other men) is sketchy. That seems be their problem. Through most of their hesitating courtship, we wonder why Hayes doesn't take more of a lead. Most of the time, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss plays like a gay film. It would have been better as an offbeat film about the appealing characters created by O'Haver. Still, the music and dream sequences add an exceptional charm, both celebrating and lifting us out of the genre.******* Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998-06-04) Tommy O'Haver ~ Sean Hayes, Brad Rowe, Richard Ganoung, Meredith Scott Lynn "},{"Title":"Love, this is my song","Date":"28 November 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss is a small 1998 film about a gay photographer (Sean P.

Along the way, Billy develops a crush on Gabriel, even though he's not certain of Gabriel's feelings for him.There's some old dogs hauled out and given new polish in this flick.  Three drag queens serve as sort of a Greek chorus throughout the movie, usually lip-synching to Petula Clark and camping it up.  The opening credit sequence featuring these three was truly hilarious.  Heterosexuals (especially males) are portrayed as slabs of meat following their slavish desires for women, but it's done humorously.  Paul Bartel goes *way* over the top playing a Bruce Weber like photographer, openly and contempuously laughing at the people who purchase his art (the character obviously is doing it just to be near stunningly handsome, near-naked men that are young enough to be his grandchildren) and the character of Whitey was just plain annoying.However, despite some of the cliches, Hayes' performance reveals the splendid sense of comedic timing we would later see in his supporting role on Will and Grace; he often puts Brad Rowe to shame in their scenes together, Rowe often seems a  stiff and wooden next to Hayes, often looking like he just doesn't get it.Overall the movie's a cute piece of fluff, a nice popcorn date movie.

The spoofs on classic films and the movie-like dream sequences were at times side-splitting.I thought the film possessed a certain serious subtext but it never competed with the comedic intent of the script. The actors were flawless in their understated deliveries of their often witty lines. Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss is a delightful film that should be seen and enjoyed by gays and straights alike.

While I'm sure there are other films that follow the same truths, this one seems to have something honest to say about feelings and what they may or may not mean.  The director/writer keeps the most physical intimacies out of the way, letting eyes and words describe the emotions of each character. I really enjoyed the script and the creative side of the director, who also used lighting and colors well.  One more thing--It's nice to see a movie where not one person is violent or evil. Even if everyone doesn't necessarily get along, at least no one raises voice or hand in anger.  Thant's pretty unusual, and cool.

Credibility aside, the characters make you care about them. For one thing, Billy, as played by Sean P. Hayes, is very appealing--so much so that you can FEEL all that anxiety when Gabriel agrees to spend the night and tumbles into Billy's bed.  When Gabriel decides to pose for the famous photographer Paul Bartel, it's almost like a personal blow that he might be slipping away from the earnest Billy.  Brad Rowe as Gabriel is wonderful as the unattainable model, too.  The drag queen numbers wear out their welcome after a while, though.  One thing that really caught my EAR was that snappy Petula Clark number Happy Heart which I hadn't heard in years! Overall, this a fun film that I would certainly recommend.

Others might feel a bit left out and some viewers might be put off by some of the humor and portrayals of straights and Hispanics. But if your a gay male you will probably identify with many of the situations as the main character goes through relationship trouble that we've all been through. Despite its glossy look, the film's characters are rather real and the ending is a pleasant surprise (not a roll your eyes predictable ending). There is a fantastic scene between Billy and Gabriel where the tension is played incredibly well. The drag interludes are a bit tired, maybe because we've seen it done more effectively in the film Stonewall. In short, if you are part of the primarily-young somewhat-urban gay male crowd you will find the film entertaining, and if you are a romantic you will also find it touching and familiar.

When he is at a small cafe' with his best friend, he meets a gorgeous worker, Gabe (Brad Row). So, Billy being raken back by Gabriel's beauty - asks him if he could photograph him...professionally. But the thing is...Billy doesn't know if Gabe is a homosexual or not.Well I won't tell you the rest or give away anything but I will tell you this This film is so great that you don't even pay attention to the fact that Billy is gay - you just wish he would end up with Gabe. The musical score is amazing and Sean Hayes is TERRIFIC that you don't see any Jack Mcfarland-ness in him.People complain that there was barely any kissing. Well of course there wasn't! This was supposed to be shot like a semi-classical film back in the...maybe 30's. Back then, there were no raunchy sex scenes. So if you love sweet complex romance, go watch this.

I found the movie charming, and the character of Billy especially so.  The scenes at Billy's apartment with Gabriel--the uncertainty and longing and desire for the other--is something we've all gone through.  The scene in Billy's bedroom had my stomach in knots just as if I were going through all that Billy was feeling.  Very effective.  As for Gabriel--the character has been accused by some posters as a stereotypical gay and an insensitive gay jerk, only attracted to gorgeous young men.  I don't agree.  I'm not entirely certain that he's gay--I think his orientation is still in question in his final scene, for the character played by Jason-Shane Scott is not identified as gay.  There's no reason to think that he and Billy won't renew a friendship.  I think I'll go and buy it tomorrow (and I'm not a 20-something, shallow gay man--I'm 40+ and well-adjusted and happy.)

Both dramatically and comedically, he gives a lovely performance and makes Billy an endearing man, we'd all love to have as a friend. The handsome Brad Rowe is his perfect foil as Gabriel- the sexually confused object of Billy's affection. Brad gives a sensitive, warm and appealing performance. Brad and Sean play together seamlessly.Adding vital support is Richard Ganoung - back with us once more (remember his unforgettable work in PARTING GLANCES?)as the older and wiser mentor, Perry. Meredith Scott Lynn is a delight as Billy's wacky girlfriend, Georgina, and Paul Bartel lends fine support as the effete Rex Webster. Chris Bradley gives us six memorable scenes as Georgina's well-meaning, goofy boyfriend, Andrew. He's a doll.You want to hug everyone in this cast - their characters are all trying so earnestly to be happy. We're rooting for all of them all of the time. Loved the happy ending. Want a sequel.

Now after years in LA, he misses the sedentary monogamous lifestyle of the straight world he left behind. He yearns for his Mr. Right.Into Billy's life struts Gabriel; waiter, musician, model. He and Billy hit it off immediately. There is an attraction, but is Gabriel also gay? He says he has a girlfriend, or does he really? The entire movie is the romantic kabuki dance Billy and Gabriel engage in while sorting out their relationship.Not bad, but this one-note movie stretches it's story pretty thin before crossing the finish line. It does keep its legs though and is not a bad rental when in the mood for a trifle.

These movie makers apparently have never seen a gay person east of Beverly Hills. Stereotype, California gays are all alive and well in this film.  The drag queens added nothing to the story or plot line and were as untalented as they were unpleasing to see.  The sets were trash and had cheap written all over them!

This isn't a complicated film, and if you're looking for a movie that gets all angst-filled and dramatic with its portrayals of gay relationships, this isn't it. This is just a very charming and delightful movie about the bittersweet longing for someone you fear you can't have. I think the ending, sometimes maligned, is simply saying that the quest for love is universal and unending. You just gotta keep looking. It seems that very few people actually ever find true love, so the rest of us just have to make do the best we can with the journey. BHSK is, up to a point, also about that.

But every once in awhile, I try to check out something in the hope that things have changed.This was not a movie that met my hopes. Frankly, I was irritated by this movie from the opening narration, full of the sort of sad melancholic gay me, outcast as a child with Mom my only friend, unable to really connect as an adult which has made my life sort of sad, but I try to joke my way through the pain narration that should have dropped out of gay art years ago, along with pink feather boas and bad Judy Garland impersonations.There's nothing HORRIFIC about this movie -- it just plods along its relatively predictable path, occasionally stopping to underscore silly or offensive clich√©s like the gay man with the fag had best friend, or the older gay gentlemen and his loud and crass sexual double-entendres or the standard attempt to portray a gay party that consists primarily of witty insults among the guests. The odd bits of drag and performance art were just annoying filler.Sigh.I will say that the connection between Hayes' and Rowe's characters does work and the scene where they are in bed together is played very well. (For those who haven't seen the movie, don't get too excited about the idea that there is a bed scene between them -- it's a good scene, but not what you're thinking.)But, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out, the way that their relationship is left -- specifically the way Rowe's character behaves in his last scene, simply doesn't fit with how he's behaved (or what we've been told) before. Overall, I didn't find that this movie warranted spending the 90-some minutes I spent on it and I really couldn't recommend it to anyone. On a larger note, this film made me think a little about why so much gay cinema is unsatisfying. I suspect that one of the problems is that so much of it is based on material prepared by younger first-time writers/first-time directors, who often seem to be exploiting gay life as a way to get a first movie made or seen, but who then go off to do more mainstream projects afterward. What is missing are mature writers and directors (and I realize that mature in Hollywood means, at most, 35 but even that would be an improvement) making films about gay life when it has moved beyond the issues that pertain either to the coming-out/lost loves of early adolescence period or to the lives of gay men during the screw-around and party and try to get a boyfriend stage.

Then it all leads up to a ridiculous and real bad conclusion--it's supposed to be happy, but it left me cold. This movie tries (too hard) to appeal to gay and straight audiences and ends up doing neither. The acting is pretty good (especially Rowe), but the movie is just bad.
