[{"Title":"Revenge of the 80's The sequel!","Date":"7 November 2004","Score":"22 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Another 48 Hrs. (1990) was another sequel. During the 80's any movie that made the slightest of profits made a sequel. For one reason only, to make even more money. However many producers never made another dime off of the momentum of the previous film and were stuck with a sequel that cost two or three times as much as the original film, Another 48 Hrs. was a prime example. The only reason films that produced multiple sequels raked in the dough was the films were cheaply made, low overhead means more potential for a profit. When you pour millions into a movie and expect to make a buck, two out of three times you're going to lose your shirt. The movie has a rushed into production feel. I felt the same way after watching Scary Movie 2. The director was given what he had to work with. I can't fault Walter Hill because he made a pretty watchable movie. The problem was this film didn't need a sequel. The end results are a remake of the first movie. No more, no less. This film was made during the peak of Eddie Murphy's over exposure period. Like so many actors, he was a victim of his own excess. Nick Nolte seemed to be going through the motions whilst Eddie Murphy had that look at me thing going.Overall it's not a bad movie. But if you're expecting something different then look elsewhere. Maybe the filmmakers should have watched the first movie again before they wrote the script. It would have helped a bit. Recommended for fans of the first film.B "},{"Title":"A bit far fetched, yet entertaining","Date":"5 January 2002","Score":"12 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I'll be the first to admitt that the sequel probably isn't as good as the original, but for some reason i get much more enjoyment from watching it. Perhaps it's due to the fact that Murphy gets to show off more of his comic talents then he does in the original,but whatever the case i found this to be an enjoyable flick which unfairly recieved some harsh critisim (in my opinon). The basic plot for Another 48 Hours is that Detective Jack Cates(Nolte)has for years been attempting to track down a underground criminal only known as the iceman. Then when Cates finds out the iceman wants his old buddy Reggie Hammond(Murphy)     dead, he enlists his help to bring the iceman down (because apparently Hammond is the only person ever to have seen the Iceman). A few notes, at the end of the original film, Hammond only had 6 months left to go on his sentence. However since then his sentence has been changed to 6 years because he apparently robbed the prision payrole(hey i'm not making this stuff up). Ganz's(the main bad guy, from the original 48 hours) brother is one of the bad guys who has been hired by the iceman to kill Hammond and Cates. The sequel is more comic-like than the original,and truth be known some parts of it's storyline are flawed (we never really know the real story behind Hamond being detained for another 6 years)and the Jack Cates character is more lukewarm then the original. But still, Another 48 Hours provides much entertainment and if your a fan of Eddie Murphy i would recommend you giving this one a try.

But then most sequels do. Same characters, same personalities leads to some of the stuff being same-ish. Yet I ask you, how many people do you know that drastically change overnight? Not that many. So the same characters having the same reactions and habits to similar situations is not that far fetched. Hill Street Blues characters didn't change that much either yet it stayed entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The acting is of a very high quality and so are some of the action scenes. And there is a twist in the film I didn't see coming.

If he had released this film immediately after the first one, it would have become a flop.  The reason is because both films are very much alike.  Another 48 hrs. hasn't got anything new to offer; it's an almost exact copy of the first one.  And that's precisely why they waited so long before making this sequel.Nothing really changed actually.  There's Nick Nolte who plays the same cigarette-smoking and alcohol-addicted tough-guy cop forced to team together with Eddy Murphy who takes up his part as the noisy, bad-mouth and know-it-all convict-character again.  Just like in the first film, it's the chemistry between these two actors that makes Another 48 hrs. really worth-watching.  And just like in the first film, the only decent acting comes from Nick Nolte and Eddy Murphy while the rest of the cast is merely below average. Once more the action scenes are great to watch.  This is a good thing, because it makes you forget about the weak script.  The dialogues are funny, but they're overloaded again with harsh language.  Some might find this annoying; I honestly thought it became funny after a while.The ending is pretty weak and predictable, but on the whole Another 48 hrs. is almost as good as its predecessor and good waste of time; not money.

This is the kind of movie which you should see with your friends on a Friday-night, with a great bowl of pop-corn. The actors, such as Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (the original 48 Hours team) have a great chemistry between them and their combination of action and fun works well for the film. The movie is very funny and you'll have a hard time not enjoying it, with it good soundtrack and quite original, cool scenes (such as the bus-scene). I would like to mark Andrew Divoff's performance as Cherry Ganz, one of the biking psycho-killers that Murphy and Nolte are after. Divoff really scared the crap out of me with his wild, fierce, hyper portrayal of Cherry Ganz, who also contributes to alot of killings and violence shown in this film. People who say that 48 Hours is the untouchable original are wrong because the sequel was made by the same director who's style you immediately recognise in this picture. Another 48 Hours is as good as the original and is doubtless a highly entertaining film!

This is because it never really elevates itself above the material it actually is. At a time when the Lethal Weapon films had proved there was a demand for white cop with black sidekick buddy combination type films, Another 48 Hrs. is perhaps a cash in sequel to a film that was never anything special any way. Where as it sounds like I'm being negative, the film was enjoyable for what it was and that said; I would have a hard time in deciding which one I liked more.A scene from this film which typically sums up the genre the film is working under highlights not only the genres inability to ever be anything above a certain level but also the problem films face when they age. The film is a crime film; a buddy combination of two people getting involved in shoot outs and general criminal activity whilst battling each others egos. In 1994 when Pulp Fiction came out, films like Another 48 Hrs. were history and a particular scene is defining evidence shortly after a prison bus has rolled over a few times, two hells angels are going to kill someone on board. But what happens is instead of riding up to the overturned bus and finishing the job, they park their bikes a few hundred yards away, get off very slowly and walk up to the bus with the intent to kill. Now, there is absolutely no reason for them to do this apart from add suspense to the scene and perhaps have two bikers walk in tandem; in slow motion amongst the heat wave in a 'cool' fashion. This is the point; films such as these rely on what would look good cinematically rather than stick to what their characters would do.I know it's wrong to compare a film to another film made after it but this highlights not only the bad way in which Another 48 Hrs. has aged but further cements what a great film Pulp Fiction really is; the buddy combination in that film of Jules and Vincent who are by no coincidence black and white but Tarantino plays with realism in the film and the scene in which someone is accidentally shot in the back of the car is so much more clear in the sense it is two fingers up to scenes like the one just mentioned in Another 48 Hrs. The film starts off with Reggie (Murphy) still in prison and shows up its other half of the buddy combination as a bit of an idiot. Another 48 Hrs. suffers from its clich√© that its best cop on the force, Jack (Nolte), is actually a loose cannon whom needs to be removed even though the job is actually perfect for him; an idea toyed with in the third Die Hard film but with John McLane. Jack seems certain that an antagonist known as The Iceman is at large but is demeaned and shown up as perhaps a bit of a schizophrenic; one officer labelling this Iceman as an imaginary friend/enemy who Jack has been pretending to chase.Unfortunately, the initial incident in the film happens a little early by way of a shooting at a race track. What I couldn't understand is that with all those people watching the race, nobody saw the bad guy shoot at Jack and consequently; the police have their eye on him. Reggie on the other hand is out of jail and he miraculously survives an attack on a bus (mentioned earlier) as it rolls over several times; something that would have killed him. But the film suffers from it lack of logic that can be applied to certain situations The bus rolls over; the bikers aren't professional enough; the back up arrives a too quickly and are unable to spot the bikers fleeing; the bikers in other scenes get their guns out in full public view too many times but nobody ever seems to mind and generally, there is an acute sense of frustration during these times. But the film backs itself up with a scene in a nightclub during which it makes a pastiche out of its predecessor by putting Jack in a punch up only for Reggie to save him by acting out his cop/no nonsense routine by threatening to shoot first and the ask questions later. Along with this, Jack even makes reference to 'typical bar punch ups that you get in the movies' where he states someone always hits else someone over the head with a chair or a glass bottle. Jack then does exactly that with a bottle and the chair soon follows.But to me, this is Another 48 Hrs. recognising that is knows what it is; that it knows the formula its using and is having fun playing around with the clich√©s; even if scenes such as the bus rolling and the bikers not doing what they should do by finishing the job. The film is by no means great or groundbreaking but I was never bored or put off by what I was seeing; it may have lacked realism and been since pushed down a peg in the crime genre hierarchy by bigger and better films but it remains entertaining to a degree with gunshots powerful enough to propel people through windows and cops smart enough to wear bullet proof vests whilst off duty. Another 48 Hrs. is by no means a big winner but it is by no means a massive loser, even if it may indeed look like that in another twenty years.

And we won't even go into the monumental plot holes. Gigantic plot holes. Brobdingnagian plot holes. And while I hadn't previously noted the enormous amount of glass breaking, until reading the comments, yes, I'd have to say they made it more or less a motif of the film. Murphy and Nolte did reasonably well resurrecting their respective characters, and there were some truly funny moments, and truly snappy repartee. But it's not enough to save this one.

As for me, among many things, it's the Buddy-Movies.Since the 1970s' end the 1980s' start, the action movies became big and loud, the expression Blockbuster has been founded, and the Buddy-Cop movie became the most fashionable subgenre. So, despite my feelings about the first 48 Hrs movie, I must admit it was one godfather for the genre and a milestone in its time. It was the beginning of an era that lasted for nearly 2 decades after, setting a specific formula where the Action thriller will be always with odd couple. So it's Abbott & Costello again yet in a world of madly violent bad guys, madly violent good guys, incessant swearing from everybody, streets full of unstoppable car chases, a sky that rains torrents of bullets, huge explosions every 10 minutes, police forces with only dirty cops, and continuous sarcastic clashes between the 2 partners who-are-going-to-be-real-friends !From the highest, most popular, franchises (Lethal Weapon), to (Stakeout), (Men In Black), (Bad Boys), reaching to (Rush Hour).. with the decline of the whole matter ! It was maybe the golden age of the American action movie, and definitely the golden age of the Buddy-action movie. So, after 8 years of the first 48 Hrs, it was some acme for its kind. For instance at the same year of 1990, you'd find another similar Buddies such as (The Rookie), and it was even the time to a Buddy-Cop spoof  (Loose Cannons)! So why not to make (Another 48 Hrs).The intention here was clear  making a fierce image all the time, with at least one explosion, gunfire, flying bus or man in every single scene, and when director (Walter Hill) and his writing team find no such matters to put, so they make the actor break the glass by his bare hand.. Just for the fun of it. Hence when its finale took place at a nightclub you'd catch on its real message; it's about having a noisy good time anyway.This is, unlike the original, a downright crazy action. You'd never meet a girlfriend character or a longer than one page dialogue. That surely affected the comedy in a bad way, though who said that this is a comedy? Even the first movie was anything but a comedy (otherwise if you consider the numerous swearing a comic thing !).The main plot is openly just an excuse to blow up things, but it managed to be good as whole. Along side being highly explosive (I love that), it enjoyed presenting a modern time old western outlaws, making an actual confusion about who's the real iceman ?, and spoofing itself smartly while the bar fight (with Nolte saying  How clich√© !).But the writing didn't care much about rooting the 2 leads' relationship; which is absolute crap when it comes to a flick like this before being something already had been done in the first one. Yet it got real weak points like the iceman's complicated plan to kill (Murphy)'s character (just because he saw him once!) while it's something easier to be executed in jail more than doing it outside ?! Plus I felt that something didn't fit (Eddie Murphy), he has nothing funny to do but imitating James Brown rapidly, and he got to say the same speech of having a bad day twice already (at the hospital, then at the bar!!??).The 2 leads look fatter than the first movie. They deliver, especially to each other, spiritlessly. (James Horner) uses his original catchy main theme yet the movie doesn't give him a space to say more. (Walter Hill) seems having a riotous good time, I believe he wanted to pay a little homage to Sergio Leone's (Once Upon a Time in The West) at the slow, kind of long, opening titles in dusty desert with 3 killers gather to murder one man. And Although he managed to blast it at his full blast, but I saw that the climax wasn't up to all what was before it of stronger action.For rare time the tagline speaks the truth  Here they go again. Only faster. And tougher. Am I add bigger and louder, but not funny !P.S  At one moment of the movie (Murphy)'s character says if the sh*t became with price, these ones will be born without asses, it's a line from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel (The Autumn of the Patriarch) !! Or is it too far coincidence ?!

There is a little explosion but they don't find the other guys gun. So Jack is in big problems because he is likely to be charged with manslaughter. Jack visits Reggie (Eddie Murphy) in prison and tells him that he only gets his money (which Jack stored for him) if he helps him. Reggie gets really mad. BTW Reggie says he was in prison for 7 years which gets explained later. Because in Part 1 they always talked about (I think) just a few (like 2 or so, but don't hold me to that) years. Oh and on of the bikers, who are supposed to kill Reggie is the brother of the bad guy in the first movie. Well, Reggie gets out of the Prison and is on his bus. while that happens there is an attempt on Jack's Life. Because he is on the search for a ominous Drugdealer called The Iceman. (BTW I missed something before Reggie was in his cell alone and singing to his James Brown tape. Looks exactly as it did in Part one. When the movie came out, I read that this Scene was put in to compensate Eddie Murphies Wishes. But it was funny one time. The second time it looks kinda out of place.). All that happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. So you can imagine that there is a lot of action in this movie. After a while they get to be good buddies during the movie again. It's very similar to the first movie. And a lot of scenes are kind of just copied from the first one (I mean storywise) Since Walter Hill had 8 Years to come up with a new and entertaining and sometimes funny story. But the movie just hasn't the charm of the first movie. Though if you enjoy either Eddie Murphy or Nick Nolte You'll like it I will not spoil the rest of the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet and tell you who the iceman is. Now it get's explained why Reggie was in the Can longer. He was framed for illegal money possession in Jail. Since Jack doesn't give Reggie his Money they have to work together, and Reggie isn't happy about it. Nobody from the Force believes Jack about the Iceman... Well the story develops as you might think.. They go through a lot and become good buddies again. I am watching the Movie right now. The revelation who the Iceman is, that is the only real surprise in this movie, the rest is real predictable. Well it's a typical Buddie Movie as they did back then (like from the middle 80ties to the beginning of the nineties)... like the first Lethal Weapon Movie. First the two don't like each other and during the movie they become best friends.(It's sad that they, for the most part, don't make 'em like this anymore).. If you like these kinds of movies you will like this one.. I like them from back when they were new, so I still do. But if you are used to Movie like they make 'em today , I really don't know if you will enjoy it. But it is a pretty good movie. Watch it and decide for yourself. And if you haven't seen Part 1 (48 Hours) get that one too. O.K. I will watch the rest of the movie now and enjoy myself. One last thing I really think, the movie is worth 7 out of 10 points.

So in a sense, this is just the creative players from 48 hours getting paid their due. It's also another spin for Hill on the dying embers of the West, with a motorbike gang (I sense this was first drafted in the 70s) proclaiming themselves the last true outlaws and bastions of freedom before offing some random cops and entangling themselves with Nick Nolte and his amazing never-ending revolver (I count 11 shots in the final barrage of bullets into the bad guy alone). Familiar scenes are replayed again by people now so rich (and yes, I'm thinking Eddie Murphy here in a redneck bar) that the good guys come off as cruel rather than heroic. Bult Walter can still trade gunfire with anyone out there, and for that reason alone it's worthy of your attention. It also looks like a Tony Scott film with it's earthy tones and blazing suns.

Much like the car chase in Bullitt; its the part you remember years after you've forgotten the plot of the film.Nick Nolte is excellent as the tough but rather dumb cop commuting between mayhem zones in his tired and much abused Cadillac convertible. Most of the western-style action takes place in sleaze-bag honky-tonks and a brothel. Quite effective.Excellent action throughout but the broken-glass festival at the end is a little overdone. The fake streetcars are very unprofessional. Why spend so much money and effort on some scenes and then blow it on basic glitches like that? Movie audiences DO notice that sort of thing, just like airplane vapor trails in Westerns, so stay on the ball, Hollywood.Speaking of balls, my favorite scene in this film is the one where Eddie Murphy gets the drop on Nick Nolte with a basketball ! Either Nolte is a very good actor or he really didn't know it was coming. Maybe both. Try doing 20 takes of that scene sometime.Perennial villain Ed O'Ross (Red Heat, Universal Soldier) is in there as one of the bad cops and duly gets drilled in the finale. Has Ed O'Ross EVER been in a film where he didn't meet a violent end ? The problem is that as soon as you see him, you just know that he's going to be one of the heels.

Don't know what happened. Same director, same leading stars,almost the same premises and what a misfire! What a shame. I was really looking forward to seeing this sequel because of the classic 48 HRS(1982) before it. But what a disappointment. This one doe not even have a Nolte vs Eddie rematch fight! (It's like it was trying to hard to replicate the success of the 1st one.(Big mistake) Even having the same music and actors and the most unbelievable , the same lines!!? Being repeated here again just made them lose all their power per say(Call for help now!) (Roxanne!..) Nolte calling Eddie convict etc...had this been more of homage then maybe it would have worked differently.In this one Eddie Murphy is now the star and Nick Nolte his co-star. They still have that chemistry but somehow it just isn't the same or funny like it was in the original. Brion James returns as 'Ben Kehoe' from the original,but now in a bigger role as in the most unbelievable ridiculous I can't believe I gotta swallow this oneway. He turns out to be now the main bad guy(the 'Ice Man')this in turn explains in some crazy way that it was Kehoe's money that 'Reggie Hammond'(Murphy) stole in the 1st movie!!?? What the hell??!! That was the best they could come up with as a story? gimme a break! Why did he wait till the sequel to get Eddie killed??! Doesn't make sense! Another actor from the original is supposedly here also(I didn't see him at all) and that is the great Frank McRae as 'Capt. Haden',he is listed here on IMDb in this film as uncredited but I still not see him for nothing. Annette O'Toole, who played 'Jack Cates's girl 'Elaine' in the original,(wisely) sat this one out as they explain that she and Jack are now divorced and she went back home somewhere.Of the new blood we have the great Kevin Tighe doing what he does best, playing a slimy , sleazy type of role. Here he is 'Blake Wilson' the Internal Affairs guy out to get Nolte. good turn for him. He even gets punched out big time by Nolte! Next we have the great(and one of my favorites) Ed O'Ross in a thankless role as a crooked cop who is in cahoots with the Ice Man. He had a much better role earlier in Walter Hill's Red Heat(1988) as Viktor 'Rosta' Rostavili. Here, he was just wasted.The main villain here is played by none-other than the great Andrew Divoff. He plays 'Cherry Ganz' the brother of Albert Ganz from the original that was played by the great James Remar. Divoff did a believable(even with the fake wig and stuff) job, even sounded a lot like Remar's Ganz but then again they are suppose to be 'brothers' so that totally worked for me.i was surprised to see the great Bernie Casey.Don't get me wrong, he did a great turn as 'Kirkland Smith' the man inside prison with Murphy that Eddie 'owes' a favor big-time. His role was brief but good. His daughter in this film is played by Tisha Cambell(Gina from 'Martin' fame) that was nice but she came out to close to the end and once again I feel she was wasted in her brief thankless role. it would have been interesting to have had her come out earlier and see if she and Murphy would have had some chemistry. Oh well, we will never know.It looks like director Walter Hill uses many of the actors he has worked with in his prior films. Like for instance Brent Jennings who was in Hill's Red Heat(1988) as 'Abdul Elijah'. here he has the role of 'Tyrone Burroughs' the so-called 'Ice-Man's right-hand man.It was a OK role but I feel he was wasted also. Another actor used was the late Edward Walsh, who sadly this was his final film. he had a brief role also as a fellow detective of Nolte and was just not used properly like he was in Hill's debut Hard Times(1975) as the sleazy, double-crossing 'Pettibon'. This film was not a good final swansong for him.The late character actor of countless B Movies Hoke Howell had a brief bit here as an ill-fated bartender. Stuntman/actor Allan Graf did both jobs in this one also in his brief bit as the ill-fated bus driver.Also performing stunts only was the beautiful and talented Patricia Tallman.Two very surprising bits that were so brief you better not blink type were from two very distinguished Asian actors George 'kee' Cheung and Dana Lee. I barely saw George's scene but missed Dana's completely. What made these very talented actors at this juncture of their long career's take these throwaway bit roles is a mystery to me. Maybe they were Walter Hill's friends and did it for a lark or they were just happy to be working and getting paid no matter what the role required. Complete mystery. Ironically, these two gentlemen had previously worked together 5 years earlier in RamboFirst Blood part 2(1985) in way better roles being the bad guys/villains to Stallone's Rambo.And last but certainly not least, is the blink and you'll miss it scene of the great Kitten Natividad shown briefly as a nude stripper in a movie playing in the background as the action/climax just tears up the screen she is on. I guess you gotta take what you can in Hollywood and I'm thinking that's just what these actors all did! )P.S.

Following the theory that success is not to be tampered with, director Walter Hill has paired up convict Eddie Murphy with cop Nick Nolte and poured them in to story little change from the original. Just like the first movie, Murphy is released from prison and must unwillingly help Nolte solve a crime in 48 Hrs. They happy ending of the first movie is long since gone, and the two don't like each other again. Presumably, so we can have the same bickering banter all movie before the out their differences aside and take down the bad guys as in the first movie. The score is reused from the first movie as is the song 'The Boys Are Back In Town'. As well as all that all the best scenes from the first movie are duplicated here.To be fair the story has been updated a little bit, Nolte is no longer permanently hungover, his wife has left him and Murphy is out of prison permanently.Crude, mindless, foul mouthed and violent.

And while Another 48 Hrs is not as good as the original,the film is still a solid sequel.Set seven years after the original,Another 48 Hrs finds Jack Cates(Nick Nolte)trying to track down and nail a drug lord named The Iceman,a drug dealer who has been operating in San Francisco. With nowhere to turn,Jack needs help once again from Reggie Hammond(Eddie Murphy)who's been in prison for five years and is about to get out. The only problem is that The Iceman wants Reggie dead. Now,Jack and Reggie have Another 48 Hrs to bring down The Iceman and with Jack and Reggie the boys are back in town with more laughs and thrills.Released in 1990,Another 48 Hrs is an entertaining sequel that not only came out 8 years after the excellent,landmark Action-Comedy classic 48 Hrs but also came out after the Box Office success of the first two Lethal Weapon films. While Another 48 Hrs was a Box Office success,the film received a mixed reaction from film critics who felt Another 48 Hrs was too much like the original and while this film isn't very creative or truly groundbreaking like the first film it's still a fun and thrilling movie that entertains you for 95 minutes. Another 48 Hrs is a good Action-Comedy that pretty much taking what worked in the first movie and bringing it to this film mixing thrilling,intense Action with hilarious Comedy that is non-stop from beginning to end. The Comedy and Humor in Another 48 Hrs. is funny and will make you laugh out loud because the Humor is very much in line with the first film showing how Jack and Reggie deal with each other while looking for The Iceman and getting into various situations that are funny with Eddie Murphy being the funny guy and Nick Nolte being the straight one. Although the Comedy in Another 48 Hrs is funny,the Humor sometimes lacks the edge and politically incorrect tone the first one had. If there is one thing that is different and bigger from the first 48 Hrs it's the Action scenes. The Action scenes in Another 48 Hrs are not only amazing but are bigger and louder than they were in the first film because director Walter Hill(who was given a much bigger budget with this film)goes completely insane with the Action with each Action scene being more explosive than the last. Hill's Action scenes always feature people flying in the air or going through broken glass and while there is people flying in the air,there is more broken glass shattered in Another 48 Hrs than in any other Walter Hill film whether it's with windows or glass doors. There is enough Action,gunfights,explosions and thrills in Another 48 to satisfy any Action film and Walter Fill fan. The main characters Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond show in this film that despite not seeing each other for seven neither one of them has changed since the last time they saw each other with the two still throwing funny jabs and insults at one another almost like they were never apart. Throughout the film we also see Jack and Reggie try to repair their friendship which has been strained(the two haven't seen each other in seven years)but as the film goes on and the two work together their partnership and friendship grows despite the funny lines the two throw at each other and the chemistry is still there. The ending of Another 48 Hrs is great and filled with Action,excitement and laughs and a twist you wont see coming at all. There is also a wonderful bit at the end that is a funny homage to the ending in the original film that will make you laugh. A great ending.The cast is terrific. Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte are excellent once again as Reggie Hammond and Jack Cates,with Murphy and Nolte displaying great laughs and chemistry. Brion James is great as Kehoe,Cates' fellow cop and friend. Kevin Tighe is wonderful as Blake Wilson,an Internal Affairs cop that is on Jack's back. Ed O'Ross does a fine job as Frank Cruise,another San Francisco Cop. David Anthony Marshall(Willie Hickok),Andrew Divoff(Richard 'Cherry Ganz)and Ted Markland(Malcolm Price)are outstanding as the three murderous bikers. Bernie Casey is fantastic as Kirkland Smith,a fellow convict that Reggie owes a debt to. Brent Jennings is sensational as Burroughs,a man that works for The Iceman. Tisha Campbell(Amy Smith),Page Leong(Angel Lee)and Cathy Hasse(Girl Bartender)give good performances as well.The direction by Walter Hill is wonderful,with Hill always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace and Hill also does a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Hill.The score by James Horner is great,intense and matches the tone of the film. Fantastic score,Horner. There is also the return of the classic song The Boys Are Back In Town by The Bus Boys and another version of the song by Jesse Johnson.In final word,if you love Action-Comedies,Walter Hill,Eddie Murphy or Nick Nolte,I highly suggest you see Another 48 Hrs.,a terrific,Action-packed and funny Action-Comedy that will keep you entertained.

He needs the street smart Reggie once again who is in jail still for a crime he claims he didn't commit.

But like I said, unfortunately Eddie Murphy's career was going down hill at the point where this sequel was made. But I loved the scene where Jack gets into a bar fight and Reggie has to help him out, I loved how he was pointing the gun at one of the fighters, and the guy calls Reggie's bluff with the gun, but Reggie shoots his knee to prove to him. Unrealistic, but funny on Eddie Murphy's part. Another 48 Hrs. is worth a look, it has really cool action scenes and all in all, it's a good action movie.

Like the first one, it's a crime thriller starring Nick Nolte as Jack Crates, a tough guy/alcoholic cop in San Francisco who hunts down cop killers by enlisting the services of a convict (Eddie Murphy). The killers this time out are violent outlaw bikers, but Cates' real target is the elusive Iceman, the drug kingpin of the area. In the eight years between the movies Murphy became a mega-success and so holds top billing in this one.The first half struck me as better than the first film, but then it devolves into almost shockingly bad in the second half. It's what-were-they-thinking bad. A good example is the scene where the two bikers drive their cycles through a movie screen during a nude sequence. Why sure! The only thing I can think of is that director Walter Hill was shooting for mythic cool-ness in the manner of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Unfortunately, he ended up with laughable dreck. To add insult to injury, the revelation of the Iceman is lame. Would a real drug kingpin keep an exhausting full-time job? Isn't the purpose of being a drug kingpin to make loads of money so you can kick back and enjoy the high life? Moreover, the conflict-habituated relationship of the protagonists really starts to grate on the nerves by the second half.There's another scene in the first half that's a cool action scene on the surface; that is, until you think about it. It's the sequence where two bikers attempt to kill someone in a mini-bus by riding alongside the vehicle on either side while blowing holes into it. All the driver has to do is swerve to one side or the other and &#x96; voil√† &#x96; both bikers are taken out. Lastly, there's just something trashy about this film. While the protagonists have admirable qualities underneath their gruff exteriors, the majority of the characters in the film seem like the dregs of society. I'll take 1984's Beverly Hills Cop over the two 48 HRS flicks any day. It's all-around better with more likable characters and redeemable qualities. The film runs 93 minutes and was shot in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Folsom, California, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada.

Walter Hill is back directing, Murphy and Nolte are back as the leads, and the storyline is virtually the same as in the first.Sadly, the law of diminishing returns hits this film hard, making it a shadow of his predecessor (which I found to be only an averagely entertaining movie at best). Every scene, situation and shoot-out is overly familiar, and absolutely nothing that happens - even in regard to the twist involving the villains' identity - is a surprise. Murphy's high-wire, sometimes frenzied acting helps add much needed energy to the production, but Nolte is sleepwalking and indeed appears half asleep in this movie.Still, on the plus side the pacing is fast and quite a lot of the humour works well. Hill's directing can't be faulted, and he's fleshed out his supporting cast with a number of familiar faces from the '80s Kevin Tighe as the IA man, Brion James and Ed O'Ross cast against type as cops, and an early role for WISHMASTER's Andrew Divoff as the baddie. It's just a shame more original material couldn't be found to sustain all of this.

I couldn't wait to go see it. The problem was that I was only 17 years old at the time, and I really hadn't grasped just how much this film had to live up to. Although I was a little disappointed by it, I still laughed pretty hard at most of it along with the entire theater. It really is a funny film. That's about all you can say for it, though.Missing is the edge provided in the first film by the ever-nasty James Remar. The plot this time around is almost impossible to decipher, also. All we know is that Murphy and Nolte have to reluctantly team up to stop some bad guys. The rest is window dressing.The humor in this film is top drawer. Nolte (one Nebraska's most famous sons) actually has the funniest lines, and he's having a ball saying them. You can tell. I always wanted a chauffeur, Reggie! and You can always catch another bus. You had a lot of luck with the last one! and so on. Murphy was also very funny. I miss the Murphy of those days just like everyone else in the world. One thing you can do when this film is on is play a neat drinking game. Every time some glass breaks, everyone has to drink a shot of beer or some other pre-determined beverage. I swear I have never seen a movie in which more glass is broken. They way over-did it with that effect.Overall, this film falls way short of the original, like most sequels. It can provide you with a night of entertainment, though.I'm feeling generous today. I'll give it 7 of 10 stars.So sayeth the Hound.   "},{"Title":"Passable sequel.

Keeping in the spirit of the original film and maintaining consistency of character, it was a worthy successor to the brilliant original.Logistically, the film is true to its origins. Jack Cates (Nolte) is on the backfoot when his determination to track down a mysterious killer called the Iceman who is the owner of the money that Murphy and co stole from in the original film finds him under investigation by IAD and has to enlist Hammond's (Murphy) help to identify and catch the man in question.The weakness is probably in using faceless Hell Angels stereotypes who are assigned to kill Hammond who really don't have the dark tones of James Remar's Ganz in the original film. As with DIE HARD, the sequels diluted the villainy at the expense of suspense.Still, there is much to enjoy in ANOTHER 48 HRS.

Meanwhile detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) for the past four years has been trying to discover the identity of a powerful drugs dealer known as the Iceman, after a shoot out with one of the Iceman's men Jack finds a picture of Reggie & figures he can help him find the Iceman. Reggie is released from prison & a hit is made on him but he survives while Cherry Ganz decides to kill Jack to avenge his brother's death but a bullet proof vest saves him, Reggie & Jack have no choice but to work together to unmask the Iceman & stay alive long enough to do it...Directed by Walter Hill who returns from the original 48 Hrs. I actually think Another 48 Hrs. is a better film than it's predecessor on just about every level. The script by Jeb Stuart, John Fasano & Larry Gross is a more balanced film, it moves along at a tighter pace, the action scenes are better, it still has plenty of amusing one-liners but has thankfully dropped the racist overtones & there's just more going on. From the problems Jack has with internal affairs to Reggie having to pay someone off who kept him alive in jail & from the mysterious identity of the Iceman to the fact that Reggie is now a free man & doesn't have to work with Jack just make Another 48 Hrs. slightly better than the original. On the down side it's nothing particularly new or original & while it's not a complete rehash of the original it can feel pretty similar at times & there's just so many buddy buddy cop flicks out there Another 48 Hrs. has sort of gotten lost in the crowd somewhat. Personally I liked it, it has plenty of bad language, one-liners, decent set-pieces & fights & a bit of mystery surrounding the plot although it's not that hard to work it out.Director Hill does alright but the film looks & feels a lot like the first, the action scenes are well handled & it's suitably profanity ridden. Brion James has said in an interview that Another 48 Hrs. ran for something 140 minutes originally & that Paramount cut huge chunks out of it including a lot of footage with him in it which I find very easy to believe, James name is third in the opening credits yet he comes across as a glorified extra. Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own. The violence isn't too strong here, some gory gunshot wounds a & some punch ups is as violent as it gets but at least it's a solid 'R' rather than a 'PG'.Apparently this made near $20,000,000 in it's opening weekend which I would imagine is a decent amount even for films released today so it's maybe a bit puzzling a third 48 Hrs. flick wasn't forthcoming. It's well made with that big budget Hollywood feel & look to it, again set in San Francisco it was again like the original partly shot in Los Angeles. The acting is good with the two leads having a good on screen chemistry & Murphy in foul mouthed mode is pretty funny to listen too, Nolte is alright but seems to be going through the motions somewhat.Another 48 Hrs. is a throughly enjoyable 90's action flick full of bad language & violence of the sort they just don't seem to make anymore which is a shame but there you go. I think it's a slight improvement on the original & a solid action flick in it's own right, worth a watch for sure.

Because 'Southern Comfort', 'The Warriors', '48 HRS' and 'The Long Riders' are very, very good, but 'Extreme Prejudice' and 'Another 48 HRS' (and the other ones that are just too tiresome to remember) are horrid.Some, like 'Red Heat' and 'Trespass' are OK, nothing more, nothing less.WHAT is going on here? What (other than a chequebook being waved in his direction by Paramount) possessed him to remake 48 HRS in the first place? That's all this is, a remake, and for those people who don't like remakes and criticise them for not being as good as the original, look at this film it's trying to be exactly the same as the original and it sucks.

Nick Nolte and others involved with the movie, vowed never to work with Eddie Murphy again. There were constant spats on the set with the biggest complaint that Murphy would arrive three hours late for filming while everyone would have to set around and wait for him to show up. If the above was true, Murphy is not the one to blame for the movies failure. 'Another 48 Hours' offers no surprises, originality and a plot that has been recycled over and over again.Co-written by the director of the first installment, Walter Hill, (who had years to come up with something good) gives the fans of the original a HUGE letdown. The opening scene has three bikers cruising all over the country blowing innocent people away and apparently they work for a major drug dealer known as Iceman that Jack Cates (Nick Nolte)has been trying to track down for years. The Iceman wants Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) dead for reasons that go unexplained throughout most of the movie.Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting. The suspect is burned to a crisp in a gasoline fire but the one important clue is unbelievably sparred.So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours,' something is now wrong. Nolte and Murphy don't seem to be enjoying themselves. They are not having fun. And either am I.The routine plot becomes more routine as the writers seem to know that the movie is not funny and try their best to distract the audience with endless car chases, shootouts, and the likes. One unintentional laugh I got was watching a bus roll over a dozen times at 50 miles an hour with Murphy in it but later seeing him walk away without a scratch. And the so called surprise when the identity of the Iceman is revealed is about as believable as Frosty The Snowman.

Set pieces are good, the plot can be a little incoherent at times, but it hurtles along at a good enough pace, you really forget that the chief bad guy is named after a Marvel character.If it were made before Harlem Nights, it would probably have had success like BHC 2, but one feels that Murphys ego was partially to blame.A fun movie.

Nick Nolte took top-billing in 48 HRS, but Eddie Murphy now takes top-billing over Nolte in Another 48 HRS. The only character from the original who returns is Jack Kehoe (Brion James), a friend and police colleague of the Nolte character Jack Cates. The villains are two long-haired, leather-clad, trigger-happy bikers who have no qualms against cold blooded murder and prove it in the opening scene in a desert cafe where they blow away two cops and then kill an innocent bystander--the cafe owner. One of these bikers, Cherry Ganz (Andrew Divoff of Air Force One), wants to avenge the death of his brother who Cates killed in the original movie. You know Ganz is a bad guy because he wears the tattoo of a tear beneath one eye and the strap on his boot where the spur would be holds bullets. The one character who is conspicuous by his absence is the police captain that Frank MacRae played, though if you look hard enough you might catch a glimpse of him. Another 48 HRS doesn't generate the suspense or tension of the first film and the humor isn't as consistent. You'd think that as much as Eddie Murphy put into the plot that it would have yielded better moments for him. This is another example of a thriller where the individual held hostage pleads with his friend to shoot him. Speed would later appropriate this tactic. This time around our hero Jack Cates is searching for a mythical villain known as 'the Iceman,' but this Iceman apparently does not exist in any known data base. If this were not enough of an obstacle, Cates has to contend with a conscientious Internal Affairs detective, Blake Wilson (Kevin Tighe of Road House), who has dedicated his every waking minute to seeing Cates prosecuted for a wrongful act. Cates had to gun down a suspect at the outset of the action, and nobody recovered a firearm at the sight of the shoot-out. Consequently, Jack will have to face a day in court. This possibility won't have you tearing your nails out. Meantime, Reggie Hamond (Eddie Murphy) finally gets out of jail, but learns from Cates that some bikers have a contract on him. Walter Hill, who called the shots on 48 HRS, is still calling the shots on this slick, visually opulent, but rather lackluster sequel that adheres closely to the original formula. Cates refuses to hand over the money that Reggie stashed because a couple of outlaw bikers are raising hell. Plus, these guys are tied in with the Iceman. Jack does not have to worry about standing up a female friend because he has no women in Another 48 HRS. The biggest action scene involves a prison bus flipping 17 times after a could of vengeful bikers shoot it up.When Hill and scenarists John Fasano, Jeb Stuart,Larry Gross, and Murphy under the pen name Fred Braughton divulge the identity of the infamous Iceman in the last quarter hour. Don't you hate it when the filmmakers refuse to let you participate in the process. We are never given the chance to deduce his identity before he is revealed. This revelation doesn't help this pedestrian thriller. Another 48 HRS coasts on strong performances and action sequences that Hill stages with his customary flair. The genius of Hill is that he makes this superficial, 95-minute, R-rated comedy-actioneer flow so well when the story lacks the depth of a bed pan. Nick Nolte looks in better shape in this outing, though he still chain-smokes but no longer nips off a flask. Eddie Murphy looks like prosperity has grown in him because he was a lot skinner now. Bernie Casey plays a convicted felon in prison who has asked Reggie to do him a flavor. Matthew F. Leonetti lensed the action adeptly and it looks good, especially a musical act at a nightclub. Unfortunately, Murphy does not get a chance to repeat his bar act from the first film. This is one of those sequels where anybody other than the leading players winds up dead.

That's not the case here since this one took eight years to make so why does it feel so cheap? I'm not sure why more time wasn't spent on the screenplay because the story here is just extremely forced and comes across as a bad rehash of the first film. Everything that made the original a classic is missing here including the fun back and forth between Nolte and Murphy. This here should have at least been a given but the two star's chemistry is missing and that charm is also gone. This film also suffers from some pretty weak villains and there's really no adventure or excitement in the two stars tracking them down. The biggest thing missing from this picture are the laughs, which sadly there are very few of. Both Murphy and Nolte get a couple good one-liners but the majority of the laughs fall flat. Speaking of flat, the performances from the two leads are also quite bland and never spark any life into the picture. Hill pretty much pumps up the action sequences but when everything around them is flat they really can't bring any additional life to the picture.

They make a great team, but I would have loved to see them teamed up in a fresh story or another kind of film.In Another 48 Hours, instead of eight years later, it's just four. Jack has been chasing a drug kingpin known as the Ice Man, whom some of his cronies don't even believe exists. After taking part in a shooting where the victim's gun has disappeared, Jack is in trouble. He enlists Reggie's help to find the Ice Man so that he can clear his name -- also, Jack has learned that the Ice Man has put out a contract on Reggie, who is about to be released from prison. Reggie will help if Jack will give him the $500,000 he's been holding for him. Jack refuses, but Reggie winds up helping him after a bus accident, when he's released into Jack's custody. And on and on.Another 48 Hours doesn't have the crackling energy of the first film or the excitement, though there are some good chase scenes and some funny lines. There were lots of sequels in the '80s, and there still are. This is but one and like many of the others, it's just not very good.

Almost a homage shot for shot, bad ass witticism for bad ass witticism. The bad guys have long hair, face tattoos, and have stupid written all over them. Hardly believable as operators of a huge drug operation that no one in California can track down. Anyway, bad scripting, bad set up, and this time around, bad chemistry between Nolte and Murphy. This is no way to make a sequel, it just gives off bad vibes that everyone needed a paycheque. As usual when there are no ideas, the writers decide to go for character, so Nolte and Murphy are told to exaggerate every little tic, every little thing that made it work in the first. That's what makes it everything so irritating, they're simply trying too hard.

Another 48 Hrs. copies every cop-buddy film's formula and tries to claim it as its own. Another retread of Red Heat, Turner and Hootch, K-9, and, of course, 48 Hrs. The beginning gripper involving a gang of bikers having a shoot-out in a small-town bar didn't excite me at all, and considering that's the big beginning of the film, you know what comes later on. The first was very funny, and one of the first cop-buddy/comedy/action films. This one is not. It plays more like a rip-off than a sequel to a lively film. Disgraceful.2/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Another 48 Hours... If Eddie Murphy movies persist see your Doctor.","Date":"10 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Another 48 Hours 3 out of 10 If you want a synopsis of what was wrong with many movies in the 1980‚Äôs (and why the decade has such a bad cinematic rap despite some great films) Another 48 Hours provides a great starting point. (Despite being made in 1990).The first 48 Hours was a bonafide hit that started and/or influenced the cop buddy film genre for years to come. It was Eddie Murphy‚Äôs first film and along with Trading Places made him a star. It combined comedy with intense straight up action and still works today despite having its conventions replicated in a thousand films since 1982.Another 48 Hours came on the scene at a different time. Eddie Murphy had just had some high profile cinematic bombs and people were anxious for his next great hit. (Little did we know at the time, how great a wait people would have.) Nothing that worked in the first film works here. Eddie Murphy sleepwalks through his role and the film simply is not funny.The action scenes are not much better. The villains look like a Klingon Biker Gang. There is a muddled story with a reveal at the end that could not make less sense if they tried. The direction by Walter Hill is pedestrian and the jazzy soundtrack practically assaults the audience.There are a few positives. Nick Nolte seems game throughout much of the film despite the ridiculous script and some of the action set pieces are decent. Over-all the film is a clear miss and an example of why sequels got such a bad name back in the Eighties (Okay early Nineties).Overall the film is not worth ten minutes of your time let alone another 48 Hours.

Boy are these guys scary , they're the reason why you don't want to go to an American jail . On deeper reflection they're the reason you don't want to go to America period . Unfortunately having established these bikers are ruthless violent criminals the screenwriters inject a piece of violent action which is totally unnecessary and which draws attention to their actions iun the context of the movieIf truth be told these bikers could have been amongst the best screen villains of the 1990s but the cast are let down by the screenplay , it's both very contrived while failing to explain some things . Bikers are right wing aren't they ? and these  Western Brotherhood  guys confirm this by stating they're like the old pioneers before America became a god forsaken melting pot , so what are they doing hanging around with a black crimelord ? That's because it sets up the sequel featuring Reggie and Jack , like I said contrived . It does explain how Reggie is involved but it's rather throwaway and unconvincing , the script would have been much better if it concentrated on niggling little things like how can characters be abducted from a supermarket and brought into a busy nightclub without anyone calling the cops If you loved the original then you might enjoy this sequel but it was spoiled by a very clumsy script  "}]
