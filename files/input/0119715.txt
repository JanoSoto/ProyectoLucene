Here's a movie that brings back a subject which was specific to the cartoons from the forties and fifties the game of the cat and the mouse. Here, there's a real mouse and the cat is epitomized by the Schmuntz brothers who wish to get rid of her in order to sell an old but expensive house. The more the film advances, the more the traps prepared by Lars and Ernie Schmuntz are worked out it begins with the simple, trivial trap the mousetrap and it ends with the appearance of the mouse-exterminator ( an unexpected and irresistible Christopher Walken). In short, what it seems to be a child's play at the beginning of the movie, ends up becoming a merciless fight in which there'll be no winner, no loser... Gore Verbinski adopted an inventive and clever making and he rightly choose his actors. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans form an ideal duo, not very far from the legendary Laurel and Hardy. They've got a different personality but are united to kill this mouse. Moreover, the movie doesn't only focus on this mouse hunt but also on the Schmuntz brothers' efforts to earn money in order to save their father's string factory ( a world without string is chaos...). Let's add some hilarious and efficient gags ; the movie pays a tribute to Tex Avery. Dialogs that kick the bull's eye and some cues are powerful such as in this mouse's mind, you are the intruders says Walken to the Schmuntz brothers. At last, the real mouse is, of course, a little pest (she's even compared to Hitler with a tail) but in parallel, Verbinski attempts to make her touching. At the end, a comedy without too many claims but efficient enough to please to a large public.

When they find the house may be worth millions they set about renovating it to auction it.  However they don't reckon on the house's one inhabitant &#150; a small mouse &#150; who has no intention of going anywhere.In the wrong hands this could easily have turned into a cruel slapstick and nothing else.  It's easy to see this sort of thing turning into a Home Alone type thing with the mouse dishing out cruel punishment after cruel punishment.  However it's more than that, although it has elements of those films.  The film is witty &#150; mixing the slapstick with a more adult humour and, although the slapstick is cartoony, it is also clever and imaginative in most cases.The strength of the film is in three performances.  First and second is Lane and Evans, both have an air of Laurel and Hardy (especially Lane) and they make for a good double act.  Lane gets to do his usual stuff while the more goofy antics of Lars suit Evans' stand-up routine background to the ground.  However the main success is the mouse.  In other hands he would have been a mere excuse for destruction, however here he has `humanity' &#150; a character if you will.  This is perfectly demonstrated by the unintentional chase with a nail gun &#150; how dramatic! How tense! But also how touching &#150; the mouse is given intelligence and has a motivation for what happens.Of course at heart this is a kids film and it is a very good one at that.  However these other points give it the feel that it was made for adults too.  Certainly the inclusion of Walken as a pest controller is one no child will get.Overall this is well made and is more that just a crude slapstick affair.  It can be enjoyed on that level but it just feels that little more mature.  To illustrate what I mean &#150; can you imagine the difference if Chris Columbus had directed it?  Now you've got me!

Check out the mouse swinging across a chasm on a light bulb chain! It's amazing! Kris- I give this movie 8 stars. Luna, age 6, gave it 10 stars and I thought since this is a family film, one I might not have seen without her, she deserved a voice. She gives a lot of kids flicks 10 stars, but not all. I thought the film captured the perfect feel of a cartoon, but done in live action. There are a few films that come to mind from the past that pulled off the cartoon feel, the Coen's Hudsucker Proxy, or more so even, Raising Arizona, Tim Burton's early films and a few others. None may be shot as perfectly in cartoon style as Mousehunt however, and none are as perfectly suited for kids age 3 to 10. Some of its visual delights could be called cinematic bliss, as great as anything procured by Welles or Lean. There is a fade from a white plastic home on a white cake that dissolves into a white home on a snowy white hill that should be shown in every film school. There is use of shadows and water that would make Ingmar Bergman proud. And of course, there is the mouse. The effects and photography are done so well that he convinced the kids he was real, and really smart and acrobatic. Lee Evans and Nathan Lane are perfectly cast as black and white characters. They don't look like they're related, Evan's too nice and Lane is too mean, but hey, it's a kids movie. Their characters work perfectly in the cartoon world they inhibit. They make you laugh, no matter how old you are. Christopher Walken plays an exterminator and it was right before he became overexposed in every other hip movie made. His best dialogue comes off-screen from a tape recorder. Walken could be just as funny on radio I guess, it's all in his verbiage. So rent or buy this for the family.

Bronson Pinchot could have made a better sidekick especially for the physical humor, but even with Evans, the movie is a fast furious laugh riot as the guys try to catch one inescapable mouse which knows the house better than they do. Ian Abercrombie of Seinfeld fame also joins the fun as does veteran actor William Hickey of Wings in this his last role. The mouse which is in part portrayed by real mice, puppets and computer animation steals much of the movie as does a cat from Hades which then in turn unleashes a wild and funny John and Larry (Tom and Jerry ???) sequence far funnier than the sadisticly lousy cartoon.

The idea is very simple. Two brothers inherit a rundown house from their late father. Hoping to renovate it, and auction it off to the highest bidder, they first have to evict a mouse that's made its home there. And what follows is an increasingly hilarious series of outlandish schemes, traps and slapstick.The plot may be wafer-thin, and it is really a one joke film, but I love MouseHunt! It really is that funny. Director Gore Verbinski knows all about cartoon slapstick in live-action. Something that would reach overkill in his Pirates of the Caribbean films. But in MouseHunt, the short running time means that this is a more tightly plotted endeavour, and all the more enjoyable for it.The film uses a combination of animatronics and CGI to create the mouse. And they really are very inventive. They undoubtedly used real mice for some stunts. Like the cute scene of the mouse running on top of a wheel of cheese like a giant hamster wheel. But the more difficult ones, such as swinging from a light-bulb cord, jumping onto a spoon, or hanging on for dear life to avoid being sucked up by a vacuum are all accomplished by some very impressive special effects. They recall the brilliance of the exceptional Roald Dahl film adaptation The Witches.The mouse is the real star of the film, and you can tell Verbinski considers him the hero of the piece. Placing him up against insurmountable odds like an insane cat, fire-hoses and propane explosions, the mouse emerges triumphant every time. There is some wonderful slapstick in these scenes, and they're all perfectly orchestrated. I love the part when cat and mouse are inside a piano, running on the keys, and it sounds like an ominous film score.Providing the human element, the two brothers Ernie and Lars Smuntz (Nathan Lane & Lee Evans) are both on top comic form. Evans gets to sport his usual stand-up shtick, and Lane is on fine form as the scheming older brother. He gets the lions share of all the best lines He's Hitler with a tail. He's The Omen with whiskers. Even Nostradamus didn't see him coming!The two of them take quite a beating over the course of the film. Like when they mousetrap themselves into a corner. Or a marvellously executed sequence that has them sliding down a flight of stairs in a bath, over a hill and onto a frozen lake. Then they go in the lake. It's an energetic piece of inspired lunacy that has you laughing so hard your sides feel like they're going to split open.A lot of people who've reviewed MouseHunt have compared it to Home Alone. And not without reason. The violent slapstick is just about on a par, but believe me, the mouse is much more endearing than Macauley Culkin ever will be.There's also a fine supporting cast. Vicki Lewis is perfectly horrid as Lars' scheming wife. But look out for Christopher Walken's star turn as the slightly mad and very twitchy exterminator Caeser. Like Ahab after Moby Dick, his mouse catching contraptions turn out to be his undoing.Verbinski ensures that things never run out of steam, because wisely, he doesn't allow the mouse-catching to be the sum of the film's parts. MouseHunt avoids a pitfall most other films would have fallen into. He includes interconnecting subplots that form a more substantial backbone. Such as Lars' wife, April agreeing to help them with their financial problems so she can turn a larger profit when the house is sold. As well as the future of the string factory they too inherited from their father, who a couple of heavies are interested in buying. They're weaved into the plot and called upon when required.All the different plot strands converge in the inspired last 15 minutes. The night of the auction. In one long, continuous running joke, the slapstick builds until it reaches critical mass. Its something that wouldn't have looked out of place in an episode of Frasier.The final scenes are actually quite touching, and I liked the way the mouse proves to be Ernie and Lars' salvation in the end. MouseHunt is a real treat. Delivering laughs, heart and fun in equal measure. And the musical score by Alan Silvestri is one of his best in years.Not to be missed!

I missed it when it was released and I was not too eager to see a family live/animated drama about two simpletons who want to get rid of the mouse in the house but in the traditions of Tom and Jerry or Home Alone always get outsmarted by a much smaller but smarter, quicker and unpredictably creative opponent. But hey, when someone whose opinion I respect tells me that it is one of the greats and I must keep my expectations high, I at least should check it out and see for myself. The fact that it is included in many viewers' Top 10 lists like BIG TIME SLEEPERS, Forgotten Gems, and Laugh-out-Loud actually added to my interest and anticipation. Besides, any movie with Christopher Walken doing what he does best - a crazed, creepy, and funny character, is a must see.So the story is simple - once there was a mouse, a very smart mouse that lived in an old mansion alone. One day, two brothers (rather losers) who inherited the house found out that it was a forgotten architectural masterpiece worth of millions. They wanted to sell, the mouse wanted to stay -thus the epic Mousehunt began. I am happy to report that I had a truly wonderful time watching the movie. It is darkly funny and creative. It combines live action and animation masterfully and seamlessly, and one hilarious scene runs after another without any pause culminating in the auction sequence that was made as an astounding mixture of slapstick comedy and disaster movie. Another favorite scene was at the animal shelter where Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) wanted to get the meanest scariest cat, and preferably with a history of mental illness. I'm talking' one mean pussy, in short -not just a cat but Catzilla. Christopher Walken's exterminator who took his job very seriously by trying to get inside the mouse's mind and to think how the mouse thinks, delivered a delightful cameo. I also think that the movie benefits tremendously from its timeless look meaning that we don't know in what decade of the last century it takes place but that's exactly what makes it universal. It won't look outdated for many years from now.The film was a first feature for its director Gore Verbinski, who had stunned millions of TV-viewers in 1993 when he created now legendary Budweiser commercial featuring three croaking frogs, for which he was awarded the advertising Silver Lion at Cannes and also received four Clio Awards. Verbinski then delighted the whole world with three (well, he delighted this viewer - with two) films of Pirates of Caribbean. For some reasons, Mouse hunt received controversial and rather harsh reviews from the critics that accused the film of not been able to find a target audience and not creating any characters the public could identify with and root for. I believe it is a great film for the whole family, and it talks about serious mattes while entertains. I was fascinated by the clever inventive little mouse, and the movie kept my interest and child-like joy until the very end. Even the fact that the premise of the movie in not new or original did not make it any worse. Lane and Evans are very funny together, and the movie is a work of art from the enormously visually and sound talented director, his cast, and his production team.9/9.5 "},{"Title":"The Mouse Owns The House","Date":"1 January 2009","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":" One of few comedies that is a true comedy.For the most part, this entire movie can be a silent movie and still be just as funny.The lead cast and even the supporting cast are great...but nothing beats the mouse...and I do mean...nothing beats the mouse.A very creative film with some really cool concepts and absolutely hilarious structured story.From the very opening scene to the very closing scene...pure genius.

Director Gore Verbinski runs about like the mouse itself permitting anything save for a plot. He is aided only by its production, which contains a Capra style visual appeal, but it is far from anything remotely evident of the quality of a Capra film. Lane and Evans fall victim to countless stunts that seem inspired by Home Alone. Christopher Walken is wasted as an exterminator who goes through Looney Tune accidents.

From there the movie takes off in a funhouse of slapstick pratfalls, brilliant physical comedy, cartoonish and imaginative set pieces, and a sense of humour that's playful, yet ever so subtly not appropriate for kids. Verbinski is one of my favourite directors, with a very diverse filmography. He a.ways has a great sense of spectacle and action, winning us over with fluid, funny, balanced sequences of cinematic satisfaction (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Rango). The 1940's setting adds a cool twist and almost feels like a silent film type aesthetic at times. The supporting cast is speckled with knowing comic turns from various characters actors Maury Chaykin eats the scenery, and everything in sight as a real estate debonair, William Hickey makes a ghostly cameo as the brothers father, and literally looks like he's on his death bed for real! When they inevitably call an exterminator, he's a wacky loony toon played but Christopher Walken because of course. Walken is time capsule gold as Cesar, bringing his well known loopy side to the short but sweet role. I don't get the negativity for this one.

The humor is golden and laugh out loud and it has some wonderful Christopher Walken moments in it. If you are a fan of Home Alone and want something new in the slap stick world besides Home Alone 3. Rent this movie, it is a very funny film you and your kids will enjoy and laugh.

Things got wacky when the brothers start to get rid of the mouse, using one method after another.This film was like 15 years ago but its humor is still fresh. It's one of those comedy-films where you'd laugh at the same scenes, over and over again. The first family-film by Dream Works, I dare say it's a classic. Jokes and laughter aside, Mouse-hunt teaches audience the family value, the quality of life and&#x85; how to catch a Mouse.

Lars, the loyal son, refuses to sell the factory, making his wife April (Godzilla's Vicki Lewis) mad and chuck him out, and Ernie, the not-so-honest son, has lost his five-star restaurant because of the Mayor's death (ate a cockroach). With no place to go, both of them sleep in the old house, but they soon find out the place is worth a fortune, the architect of 1876 was the famous Charles Lyle Lerue. They decide to fix the place up in ready for an auction, and Alexander Falko (Entrapment's Maury Chaykin) is the most likely high-profit buyer. The only problem they have while fixing the house is a mouse, so they are trying everything they can think of to hunt it down and get rid of it. This includes many mousetraps, a cat named Catzilla, a pest control man named Caesar (a brief but great Christopher Walken) and just chasing it and getting themselves injured to hell. Also starring Eric Christmas as The Smuntz's lawyer, Michael Jeter as Quincy Thorpe, Debra Christofferson as Ingrid and Camilla Soeberg as Hilde. Filled with hilarious slapstick, not just from Lee Evans (his trait) but Lane has some fantastic moments of frustration. This is great family fun, unless you have a thing with mice. Very good!

So, I easily found Mousehunt and yesterday decided to give it a chance. The story convinces the spectator for a particular reason it defines the characters very well. There is a big contrast between the brothers. Ernie is the ambitious member of the family, whilst Lars is the innocent guy who gives more importance to feelings than money or superficial things-- which reminded me of Paul Metzler from 1999's Election. The main plot is very obvious a diabolic rat that destroys everything in order to keep alive. The film admits its cheesiness from the get go, so you might expect it to continue that way-- and it does. In fact, there are lots of cheesy scenes, but only some of them achieve on being funny. I had about three laughs I guess. Therefore, this is the kind of movie to watch with your brains off, otherwise you'll just feel cheated by the corny situations.

Lars and Ernie are similarly sympathetically portrayed, with many lessons about keeping family together occasionally scattered throughout the film. Crucially though, the movie isn't too mawkish about it.

Because this is a damn bad comedy. A real ugly one. Although it got some good idea, polished cinematography, grand sets, moments of good directing, but nothing can end its loathsome effective sense, to be one of the most seemingly attractive unattractive movies. I told myself don't write about it, not only because all what I have to say is bad things, but also because I don't want originally to bring up the matter of watching it ever again. It's one of those memories that you can get easier in life if you managed to forget it utterly!OK, something had happened in the American cinema's comedies since the 1980s' end ; they became relying basically (and sometimes only) on vomit, fart, excrement, urine or even semen???. I think the success of movies that were pioneer bold at this area such as (The War of the Roses, Dumb and Dumber, The Nutty Professor..) pushed that ahead, or is it another circumstances related to the American society?, the international taste?, or Hollywood producers ?! I can't settle exactly, but I do know that they produce it, and somebody out there just loves it, and surely that somebody is NOT ME!How many sins in here? Many I suppose. I still ask which's filthier?  eating a cockroach, dying out of vomiting, (Christopher Walken)'s special dish, or promoting all of that as a kids movie and a family fun !!?? Actually putting one hand between women's breasts wasn't something droll, so even by the anti-family movies' measures it wasn't fun either !The only thing that amused me was the shot at the start in which the 2 brothers heard the number that one of the buyers said; their freezing, being both stunned, was the only memorable &#x96; in a good way ! &#x96; moment. Else that it's a hell of unpleasant dirtiness. The plot is how to kill a smart mouse, but there is nothing smart after that, since all what it has is victory after another for the mouse. And when the script found no solution, they trumped up one, any one, for the happy end. The real problem is that they had to fill the in-between with highly disgusting moments (to make you laugh !). Its dark twisted sense of humor killed even the scarce clever points. It got eventually obnoxious feel that suits a personality of a horror movie more than a slapstick comedy. And what could be more embarrassing for a comedy when you say after it  I didn't laugh even one time through it ?!I believe there is a specific wisdom that we're created to live a certain time in the bathrooms, long or short time it's always limited, so I don't believe that by any chance we had to get our natural time in the bathroom and in the movies also! Simply I was unfortunate enough to watch this in a theater and by virtue of its loyal determined toilet humor; it transformed the place into a toilet, being an actual crap ! So while the fabricated happy end, when you see the colorful food, you have to feel sick hard, because this very movie, during all of its time, succeeded at giving you the nausea already !Imagine what kind of movie that pushes you to hate its whole cast ? Because their acting ?, because being in it ? whatever. Truly after experiencing Nathan Lane and Lee Evans in here, I now think twice before viewing anything with their names on it. It was mean just accepting this job in the first place.After 10 years, director Gore Verbinski proved easily how his sense of comedy is mostly fruitless, that's something to say clearly after movies by him like (The Mexican), (The Weather Man), and (Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest) OHH that last one was perfectly a dead comedy.I still remember what I read on its original poster back then, it was some foul opinion for some fool critic, being between parentheses, saying Mousehunt.. The funniest comedy of the year !!!! I think it should have been  The most sick unfunny comedy of the year. At its first scene it enjoys throwing an old man's dead body in the sink, after completing the movie I threw it in the sink myself, it belongs there altogether.Sick world postulates Sick viewers, so (Mousehunt) must be made, must be loved yet not by me..

But i'm happy to say that he and Nathan Lane were great.  The relationship between them was believable with Lane being the dominant, slightly bullying brother and Evans the dim-wit - very Laurel and Hardy which is fine with me.  Actually, one of my favourite moments is when Lane fiddles with his tie, a la Hardy, when he's flirting with 2 girls. He does it so sweetly.The true star of course is the mouse who is brought to life brilliantly using a combination of real mice and computer effects.  And he wasn't made too cute either but had a cheeky and inventive, never-say-die personality. You end-up rooting for him as he (or she) appeared to be the only truly sane character in the film.The only negative thing was that for a kids film there was a bit too much swearing and bare flesh which was unneccesary and it may have been a tad too long.Overall, i enjoyed the mix of dark humour and touching moments which never seemed forced or cloying.The ending was a slight let down as i felt it was abit saccharine when you consider the glorious dark humour that preceded it.

For those of you who don't know, a Black Comedy is one that contains humanistic things that one normally shouldn't laugh at but can't help it. Well that's the simple definition anyways. Other examples of this genre include Terry Gillem's Brazil or even Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and Doctor Strangelove. This film was billed, and at first glance appear to be no more than a stupid Home ALone ripoff, with two bumbling fools out to mutilate the film's protagonist. While the film IS full of slapstick and the two fools ARE bumbling, this film is not light-hearted and cheery. In fact, quite the opposite. The protagonist's of this film are a pair of brothers who are both down on their luck and have come into possession of a really old house because of their father's death. They are forced to move in because of circumstances that can't be helped and are tormented with a psychological obsession to rid themselves of the Mouse, the other protagonist of our film. Their obsession appears to stim from their frustration with the outside world and the rotten hands they've been dealt. Throughout a series of increasingly violent encounters, building up to a blazing cresendo'(spelling, yes I know) they attempt to rid themselves of this menace. In the end their efforts are futile, but all are not lost. Now on to what makes this particular film, not just for little kids. Most of Mouse Hunt's visual gags are taken very seriously, and the bumbling fools DO get hurt, not like in the ridiculous, seemingly-indestructible, criminals of Home Alone and it's ilk. We see the humanity of all the characters, even the Mouse who is just attempting to keep it's home. The photography of the film itself is quite dar and depressing, bringing images of Jeunet Cario's City of Lost Children or Gillem's Brazil. What's quite disturbing is the treatment of Christopher Walken's character. He plays an obsessive Exterminator. His mannerisms make me wonder, what trauma occured in his life to make him so obsessed with the death of rodentia. He is brutally murdered by an angry mouse, thwarting an attempt on his own life. As I've said THIS IS NOT A KIDDIE FILM. All in all Mouse Hunt is a wonderfully DARK film about the human psyche and the effects of life on such. The Mouse serves as a symbol to represent all that frustrates us in the world. ANyone who calls this film fun for the kids or just plain pointless just didn't get it. Watch this film for what it is, a wonderful look at the darker side of humanity masquerading as a simple kiddie film. Enjoy.

Even my father, who thinks most kids' movies are bombs, actually said, and I quote It's a great movie. I love it. I actually thought so, too. While Nathan Lane isn't particularly my favorite actor, he did do an excellent job in the film. The funniest jokes were spoken by or directed at him. (A couple of examples, while not the funniest lines, still made me giggle I'm just glad he finished the place before they cartered him off to the Laughing Academy, We're looking for a cat... preferably one with a history of mental illness.) This is probably my favorite film from Lane (I definitely like it a lot better than The Birdcage). Overall, the film is a fun one, and probably one of the funniest movies of all time.

Actually, the mouse chases are more obviously copied from Tom & Jerry cartoons, but the ease with which they fit in makes it hard to avoid the conclusion that they'd have had those sequences in the Laurel and Hardy movies if they could.The big difference between this and a L&H movie, though, is also a product of progress. Because it is made with the child audience in mind, it is more crudely drawn and lacks finesse.It's perhaps difficult these days to do slapstick with the same innocence that Chaplin or Laurel and Hardy managed, and so it inevitably seems disappointing, but Mouse Hunt makes a pretty good stab.

See it, then maybe read this if you like.One thing I wondered about when I watched Mouse Hunt again recently, is the nature of the mouse. Here we have a very intelligent creature, far more intelligent than any mouse usually is, closer to Jerry of 'Tom & Jerry' than a real mouse, with powers that are evidenced by things that largely happen off-screen (he is able, on two occasions, I think, to trap threatening people in a trunk - how exactly?), and a mouse which demonstrates some very human characteristics (sleeping in a miniature bed, for example).I've started to wonder whether the scriptwriter was intending us to make a deeper connection - that he is the reincarnation of Mr Smuntz Snr...It's not outside the realms of possibility the mouse is not seen until long after Smuntz' death, and isn't it odd that he should happen to occupy that particular house at that particular time? Is he perhaps there to guide his two former sons to a place where they have a better relationship and a more fulfilled life than before? All Smuntz Snr seems to have been obsessed with in life is string, and his two sons being successful and being closer than they were, both of which is achieved by the end of the film.I never quite understood why the mouse eats the first piece of string that Smuntz Snr gave to Lars before he died, and how the mouse then becomes separated from the string it has eaten with no ill effects during the house collapse. But what if this is meant to symbolise the mouse/father taking back control in order to bestow it equally on Lars and Ernie at the end?Certainly, the mouse initially seems intent on causing a nuisance, but once it has defeated their attempts to kill it, it gives them a lot of help! Amongst other things, it gets rid of Lars' greedy wife to a Texas oil baron, destroys the old house that would have left them rich but probably unfulfilled, brings the two brothers closer than they've ever been, and by inventing cheese string, helps them out of the hole that the losses of string production had put them in and leads them to a success of their own, while enabling all concerned to have a useful function in a positive future.Or am I reading too much into it?!This was the first time I became aware of the hilarious Nathan Lane, and I thought he and Lee Evans made a great team. It's a shame they didn't double up for more films in similar roles. Bizarrely, of course, they will be working together shortly on stage in the London West End production of The Producers, following Richard Dreyfuss' departure!

Well, it is, and then it isn't. First of all, it has a great deal of tongue-in-cheek about itself - as it's directed by Gore Verbinski, one may compare this streak of self-irony to the same attitude in (particularly) the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Furthermore, it plays out sorta like Home Alone, but with a mouse substituted for the annoyingly smug kid. This is so silly it actually works, especially since creative animal wrangling (and probably the state of computer SFX at the time of shooting) means there is some almost baffling footage of an actual mouse doing stunts worthy of Die Hard - and if it's unreal for an 8-year-old to beat two burglars it's utterly ridiculous for a 4-inch rodent to beat, well, anyone, giving the movie an absurd twist that elevates it above its piers.The movie is full of references to popular action flicks, and the psychotic pest control guy who is a staple in this kind of story is amusingly overplayed by Christopher Walken.In short, I chuckled warmly many times throughout Mousehunt - the leads are funny, the battle against bankruptcy, brotherly rivalry and, of course, the mouse from hell is considerably less of a waste of time than watching paint dry...

(Guys looking for a non-threatening film that both men and women can laugh to should take note).Even without that, Mouse Hunt has a lot to recommend it. It's not really a teen film, or a juvenile film. But it is one of the few modern films that a family could watch together. However, since it didn't come from Disney (in spite of having a mouse as one of the main characters) it doesn't suffers from the faux-hip goody-goody mindset that dogs all of Disney's lobotomized live movies. I was able to play this for my older brother (who despises bad language and overt sexuality in films) without worrying about offending him, and he enjoyed it immensely. Same effect for my 78 year old father when we were looking for something to watch as an alternative to the 100th reshowing of the latest Frazier episode.But if you are a fan of meaner, angrier and less G-rated fare, don't let the purported wholesomeness of Mouse Hunt put you off. Remember the energy and violence of the old Warner Brother cartoons and the Tom and Jerry cartoons from the golden age of Hanna-Barbera? I think director Verbinski and his screenwriter and cinematographers do, and I also think that someone in the production team was a BIG Laurel and Hardy fan. Nothing else can account for the slapstick humor and superb timing of the numerous set pieces and scene designs here.This was the first movie I saw where Nathan Lane was front and center, and of course, he is superb. He has deadpan snarky delivery, perfect comedic timing, and he simply radiates humor and pathos. Lee Evans has to play a somewhat more subdued and retiring character as his brother, but he makes a wonderful foil to Lane and there is great interplay and chemistry going on as they quarrel, scheme, fight, fail, and accidentally hit each other with hammers and roof shingles. The comparisons to Laurel and Hardy are obvious, but these two actors manage to invoke those classic two-reelers without lapsing into simple homage or imitation - Lane smirks in a way Hardy never could, and Lee is definitely his own actor.Kids will laugh at the slapstick, and they will think the mouse is adorable, but the movie packs in a lot of extra aspects that will go over their heads and keep the adults snickering behing their hands. It takes a seriously bent sensibility to include the scenes with Christopher Walken, Catzilla, the string factory floor, and the hair models, and I love whoever made sure this stuff got in for it.There are a few pacing problems - it drags a bit in the beginning until the really funny stuff starts - but stay with it, be patient, and your patience will be rewarded. Mouse Hunt is a wonderful movie, reminding me of the best aspects of the old two-reelers, still focusing on the humanity of its three main characters (yes, the mouse is definitely a main character), but invoking enough of a jaundiced eye on humanity to keep audiences in the modern age from relinquishing it to the antiques pile.

I am not kidding, it is the worst movie i have seen in a very very long time. I'm not gonna waste my time to tell you what the plot is - cause it is not too hard to guess. It's a copy of Home Alone, except that it's not a little boy against 2 stupid guys, but it's a little mouse against 2 stupid guys. The gags are not funny at all, i didn't laugh a bit, not even my younger brother who is actually the main reason i watched this film, didn't laugh at all. And it's not just that the gags aren't funny - they are not original either. The acting is absolutely horrible and the ending... phhh... it s*cks.I totally disagree with one of the other users who said that this is for adults too. That is false. This is a misfortuned combination of Home Alone and Tom&Jerry cartoons. Nothing more.Vote 1 out of 10.

It is an offensive, unpleasant viewing experience that is quite possibly one of the worst and most misguided films ever committed to celluloid. Its sole redeeming feature (for adults only) is the rather titillating,  Laurel and Hardy homage, as one of the brothers tries to comically seduce two beautiful girls (who later appear with outlandish hairdos revealing a lot of cleavage). If the entire film had been like that, it would have been a great film (though still not for children, but at least adults could have enjoyed it!). As it is, it feels like the viewer is watching two distinctly different movies 1) the horrid, grotesque, violent mouse hunt and 2) a charming modern update of Laurel & Hardy, which does not mesh well with the rest of this cinematic garbage Spielberg and Company call a movie. Shame on everyone responsible for this mess. I found this film slightly less offensive than the recent DENNIS THE MENACE film, which also contained completely inappropriate levels of gruesome violence and torture (of the homeless, no less!) for a so-called children's movie.

A character (1 of the brothers) comments I had sex like I've only seen on animal planet.The mouse goes down a woman's blouse and 1 of the brothers puts his hand down her shirt. Her jealous girlfriend grabs the other brothers hand and puts it down her shirt.The mouse goes down 1 brother's pants, he jumps up and the other guy trys to grab the mouse. Comments like can you pull my little friend out ensue. Pure crap.(Spoiler alert) When the brothers loose everything and the house falls in, 1 brother's wife takes off with the rich Texan. As she leaves she gives a looser look to her husband as she hooks up with a winner.There isn't enough slapstick comedy in the world to let kids see this kind of message. Hollywood JUST Doesn't GET IT.Do not see this movie.

It contained a few spattered adult jokes, and inappropriate humor, and even some foul language in what is, for the most part, a cliché celebration of boobery. If the movie was aimed at adults only the very easily entertained could have drawn any level of amusement from this repetetive and reused script, whose only worthwhile plot twist came at the ending - the movie's only redeeming quality.  If the movie was aimed for kids, it would have hit the target, but the senseless and unnecessary use of profanity and adult humour negated it's value as a family movie.  All in all a waste of time and money, among the top 15 or 20 worst movies I've seen.

The latter seemed quite attractive and I was looking forward to go and watch the movie.  However it was an utter disappointment.  The story seems to go on forever and nothing actually happens - it's always the same old story men try to kill mouse, think they succeed but mouse gets above their heads.  Finally, obviously they make friends and open a big factory.  Rubbish.  Crappy.  Unbelievable from beginning to end.  A waste of time. "},{"Title":"Complete and utter crap!","Date":"23 May 1999","Score":"3 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  I suspect that some of the people who have written comments here (the ones who suggest this movie is either entertaining or humourous) were watching a different film. This movie is nothing more than rodent excrement. It is honestly one of the worst movies I have seen for some time. It is thoroughly unfunny, dull, predictable, and boring. It was nothing more than a weak collection of inanities cobbled together and served up by two moronic brothers. My wife and I sat through it pleading for it to end, all the time thinking it must get better. It didn't, it got worse! If you care at all about your money of the 1 1/2 hours of your life you'll lose, stay well away from this nonsense. (BTW, this is probably one of the most scathing comments I've ever given in the IMDB). "}]
