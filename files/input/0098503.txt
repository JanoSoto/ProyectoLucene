And so on. Unlike the first film with many clever and satiric elements in it, the sequel concentrates more on the not-so-clever humor and jokes and extremely over-the-top ultra gore and violence that have often been censored (the Japanese VHS, the US Tox Box DVD set and, surprisingly, the Finnish videotape RE-release are as uncut as possible & director's editions) and for a better reason than in Part I. The effects are quite splashy and nasty. There are some genuinely funny moments and bits of dialogue (especially dealing with the Japan/USA territory and cultural differences and also genuine acceptance of foreign people, something that, for example, many Hong Kong exploitation films rarely achieve or dare to do) but the spark of freshness is gone. There is also a James Bond spoof that may be funny for some; at least the long chace is well shot even though the budget for the sequel was notably higher than in the first film. Ultra gory, ultra toxic and often ultra stupid but honest trash cinema.

Ignorant consumers naturally thought this WAS the unrated cut, which is but a pile of forgettable dross with all the gleeful violence and nudity cut out by the MPAA. (and most inexplainably of all, the fate of the Japanese thug girl is completely removed, which doesn't contain any hardcore violence in the first place!) Unfortunately (or fortunately, rather) I have only heard about the notorious censored version, as I myself got the Tox Box which contained the TRUE unrated cut, and trust me when I say that it is almost on par with the first movie. The first film was a huge hit in Japan, and Troma received additional sponsorship from that very country, which is why they went there to make their film. Naturally, the plot to get Toxie to Japan is absolutely ridiculous, but that's Troma for you.Personally, I rate this film actually higher than the first, mostly because of the much higher production values which do indeed show gone are the pumpkin-head children and cheap gore effects, as this time we see some genuine splatter, such as a man being squeezed to death in a wheelchair, literally causing him to spill his guts...or a man being chopped up by a very distracted fish marketer!

This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this), Toxie now works as a concierge at the 'Tromaville centre for the blind'. It's not long before trouble rears it's ugly head though, an evil chemical producing company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to take over Tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of Toxie. After the evil chairman's (Rick Collins) first plan fails he bribes Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan & see his Father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his Mother (Jessica Dublin) & his home behind Toxie heads for Tokyo, Japan. Once there Toxie sets about finding his Father & a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his quest. Meanwhile back in Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. move in for the kill & without Toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) whom he has been lead to believe is his Father, however Big Mac is all part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once & for all...Produced & directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz this follow up to the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves the first film was a complete fluke, a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy, outrageous violence & so-bad-it's-good film-making, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a load of crap in comparison. The script by by Kaufman, Phil Rivio & Gay Partington Terry with a load of 'additional material' credits does not contain one single funny moment during it's entire 102 (uncut director's cut) duration. The visual gags are terrible, Toxie walking through Tokyo with a wig & glasses to blend in for instance, or a scene where he heats up a bath with a bad guy in it & as he cooks Toxie throws in a load of vegetable's & spaghetti, a scene where he sticks electrical wires up a woman's nose, sticks an antenna in her head & a microphone in her mouth to which a Japanese radio announcer talks into, a bit where a Japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish, a bit where Toxie grabs a swordfish head & uses it as a weapon, or the embarrassingly bad overacting & stupid idiotic facial expressions, a guy who literary has a fish for a head & gets turned literary into sushi, the awful comedy music & sound effects & the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing & memorable. The bad taste gags aren't there this time round & the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing, it just feels like a real step back from the original & lets not forget this is Troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing. There are a few gory fights & some serious gore & violence, at least in the supposedly uncut 102 minute version I saw, crushed heads with the bodies spurting out blood, smashed faces, intestines, roses poked in someones eyes & thorns wrapped around their throat, ripped off ears, severed arms & a very graphic & gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces. Unfortunately the special effects by Pericles Lewnes aren't particularly convincing & come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes. The acting is of embarrassing proportions as I've already mentioned. Action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end & a few unexciting, lacklustre fights utilising cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. Horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart. Comedy wise this is very unfunny. In fact The Toxic Avenger, Part II sucks on all levels really & to top it all off it's atrociously made as well, most of the cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner, continuity is none existent, cinematography is basic point & shoot & the special effects are anything but. One or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain & simple, do yourself a favour watch the original again instead.

It brought the small indie film studio into the limelight, which created an instant cult following, and made enough money to finance several further films. This superhero was a nerdy guy janitor who was bullied and picked on, but then fell into a vat of toxic waste and emerged a horribly disfigured superhero who would fight the bad guys in town.The year 1989 came around and Kaufman and Herz decided to make sequel and a quick buck as well, and thus 'The Toxic Avenger Part II' was born. There are a lot of fun moments here with this sequel, but Kaufman and Herz decided the more over- the-top this is, the better the film will be. That's not always the case, as is here with Part II. Instead of telling a somewhat cohesive story from start to finish and furthering along the Toxie character in their own Troma way, Kaufman and Herz decided to drag out gross out and gooey scenes too long and put together a bunch of schlocky-silly skits together with blood and guts, rather than keep the story flowing.Don't get me wrong, there are some genuine good moments here, but they wear out there welcome rather quickly, even when the crew heads to Japan for a change of scenery. After the events of the first film, Toxie lives with his girlfriend and works at the center for the blind. The town he lives in is free of the bad guys, where everyone lives more or less a hippy lifestyle. Low and behold though, the evil people at Apocalypse Inc., the evil corporation whose sole purpose is to pollute the Earth has a new sinister plan.However, they know that The Toxic Avenger will stand in their way of their cruel schemes, thus they try to kill Toxie. Meanwhile, Toxie is dealing with his own personal demons in addition to brutally killing the bad guys. He has sever depression and wants to know who his real father is, which sets him out on a journey via windsurfing to Japan to locate his father. It seems like Troma would have quite the character study here, but let's get serious for a minute. This is Troma, and Troma is mostly just interested in more nudity, gore, and violence.One of the unfortunate things here is that Kaufman and Herz throw all the playing cards on the table in the first fifteen minutes of the movie in one long action scene of destruction, and the film never recovers. They literally blew their wad too early. There are a few later scenes that pack this kind of action, but it is very short lived with long gaps of slow pacing problems. In the end, I still love that this sequel is part of the whole Toxie franchise, but it's very inconsistent and riddled with trying to go the extra mile than telling a cohesive story.

The Toxic Avenger takes care of these guys but he also must go to Japan to try and locate his long-lost father. THE TOXIC AVENGER PART II is an incredibly bad movie from start to finish but if you do decide to sit through it then it's best you view the uncut version, which will at least give you all sorts of gore. If you go with the cut version of this then you might as well take a complete star away from my rating. In its uncut form we're treated to some pretty wild gore scenes that manage to be just as disgusting as the ones in the first flick. Most of the action takes place after the home for the blind has been blown up and various thugs take their shots at the Toxic Avenger. He rips them apart in countless ways, turns a midget into a basketball and one poor guy gets smashed to where his guts are falling out all over the place. All that gore is good but sadly there's a lot of bad here. For starters, this thing clocks in at 103-minutes which is at least twenty-minutes too long and in all honesty I'd argue it's about forty-minutes too long. THe film's story is a pretty weak one even by Troma standards and they simply don't do anything with it. The stuff at Tromaville is just boring and the stuff in Japan dealing with the father simply goes no where. There's also a real lack of any comedy, which is something that made the original film work so well. Performances are pretty much what you'd expect from a movie like this. Sadly, everything that made the original so good is missing here so if you must you can fast forward to all the gore scenes and just leave everything else alone.

Will Toxie find pops and return home to save the day? Or, will Apoc Inc rule Tromaville for good? Inferior sequel to THE TOXIC AVENGER, is incredibly silly in a cartoonish way, maintaining the gore quotient including plenty of nudity and foul behavior. The film has the novelty of being set in Tokyo for a large portion of the running time, milking the fish-out-of-water formula for all it's worth as locals often stare in disbelief and fear as Toxie walks the streets seeking out the identity of his supposed father, getting help from a girl he saved from sexual assault. Toxie runs into a series of altercations with villains who work for a mob boss he mistakes for his father. The film shows Tromaville's citizens(..including the elderly, blind, and children)being accosted by the evil minions of Apoc Inc.Unlike the previous film, the sequel is narrated by Toxie(..an annoyance in my opinion that wasn't needed)throughout. The film is essentially an ultra-violent slapstick comedy adventure with Toxie punching holes into faces, crushing bodies, ripping limbs off, the works. There are explosions, a high speed chase where Toxie commands a taxi driver to pursue a biker with a bomb, and even martial arts battles where our hero duels with Japanese thugs on Tokyo streets. The ability of directors Kaufman and Herz to find people with hideous acting is unprecedented for they succeed in casting plenty of Japanese who are just as terrible as their American counterparts. Plenty of bug-eyes and overacting, and, you betcha, not one, but TWO transvestites(..Toxie even tangles with one in Japan, who taunts him as our hero attempts to walk away)who get pummeled for their troubles. I'm happy I had the chance to see the sequel uncut for the first time, the way Herz and Kaufman intended.

This time Toxie is given a different voice (Gone is the deep voice sounding monster). As any TROMA/TOXIE fan can tell you, THE TOXIC AVENGER PARTS II & III, are the ones that brought Toxie (briefly) into the mainstream. Looking back now, it's almost hard to imagine that a series loaded with sex, nudity, violent bloodshed & profanity (The first film even contained violence towards children) would spawn a cartoon series TOXIC CRUSADERS, a line of comic books, action figures & T-shirts, but it did. TOXIC II also amps up the gore effects due to it's much increased budget, in fact the gore scenes here are some of the best this series has to offer! Not only has this one got more gore, it has better gore! Toxie's look is what I refer to as the definitive look for the Toxic Avenger, true the mask looks a little rubbery, but I prefer it over his old look from the first movie. The films bigger budget also allows TOXIC II to amp up bigger & better stunts, action scenes, car chases & impressive explosions.That said TOXIC II does have many problems. The script written by GAY PARTINGTON TERRY (With TOXIC II & III being her only screen writing credits) & LLOYD KAUFMAN tends to miss a lot of what made the first film so special. While the comedy is funny, a lot of it tends to be too juvenile & the film's far more cartoonish/comic book like tone & qualities tends to outshine everything else. The first film wallowed in B movie cheapness & sleaze. It's many elements were over the top, wild & unforgettable, in fact it's own raunchiness actually made the film! THE TOXIC AVENGER PART II however ditches the raunchy humour. Due to many unnecessary, silly scene's (even by Troma standards!) the film feels dull & padded in areas & many of the films better sequences tend to over stay their welcome, such as a lengthy car chase, various fight scenes etc. The films comic book/silly cartoonish feel also extends to the films villains. It literally strips away the Sci-fi/Horror/Suspense elements that were present in the first, as well as it's mean streak. In fact had TROMA left all of the silly moments onto the cutting room floor, out of the four hour long cut, they no doubt would have had a far superior movie on their hands. The film- makers also mess up on continuity from the first film, Toxie's blind girlfriend is here called CLAIRE & not SARAH like it was in the first & his last name is JUNKO not FERD as he is referred to in the original film. Despite TROMA'S obviously bigger budget ($2 million), the film still looks & feels relatively cheap. While it is slicker in look, boasts better gore effects & features bigger stunts, chases & explosions, it somehow lacks the same charm of the first. The acting is pretty bad, since it's clear that a lot of the actors were not really actors at all. PHOBE LEGERE overacts as Claire & doesn't appear to be the same girlfriend character Toxie had in the first for some reason, since the character is radically different. RICK COLLINS is a hoot as the chairman. What should be noted is how Toxie is played by two actors in RON FAZIO (Who also stars as a member of Apocalypse) & JOHN ALTAMURA (Who left midway into the production over creative differences with the film-makers) both men do a pretty good job as Toxie, although what should be noted is how Altamura tends to have a chubbier face than Fazio, that is quiet noticeable. LLOYD KAUFMAN & MICHAEL HERZ do well behind the camera capturing the action scenes, explosions & stunts in all the right areas. The film is also self referential as we see the first movie playing in Apocalypse Ic. headquarters during a meeting. The film does have a feel good ending where Toxie reunites with his real dad.THE TOXIC AVENGER PARTS II & III, were actually filmed as one big epic movie, until Troma realized they had four hours worth of footage & decided to edit the film into two separate parts. Although TOXIC II, has many fun moments, it ultimately falters due to it really not having an ending to it. The entire film just...well ends. The situation with Apocalypse Inc. is never resolved & the films lengthy (but impressive) chase scene used for the films climax made the film feel unfinished. In short, this is strictly for fans of the first film only. Not to say TOXIC II is a complete waste of time. In fact I rather enjoyed it for what it was, but compared to the first film it just wasn't as good. Avoid the Warner Bros. VHS & TROMA'S single disc TOXIC AVENGER PART II DVD (which also bills itself as the UNRATED CUT) since they are both heavily cut & try & get a hold of the TOX BOX set (which includes the first three Toxie movies & the cartoon series first couple episodes) since the full 102 minute uncut directors cut in the first box set, features all over the over the top gore & more footage. Look for SPAWN's own MICHAEL JAI WHITE in an early role as one of the henchmen from Apocalypse Inc.

According to Lloyd this movie was being joked around about being made into a sequel until a investor became interested in purchasing it and hence this and part III were spawned. Ok..now this and III are pretty much hated by alot of people..including Troma fans. Even Troma itself has stated on Citizen Toxie the 4th film that We're sorry about II and III heres the real sequel. Personally I think it's unfair..I really do enjoy II and even III. Also II and III are the same movie from the same script..but because when they began to edit it they discovered it ran 4 hrs long and decided to split it into 2 movies.Now while not as great as the first or even the fourth , Part II has it's moments. Now this review is based on my viewing of the Unrated Directors Cut DVD that can only be found in the Tox Box as of now due to a screw up in Troma studios where the DVD release sold individually is the R rated version although it claims to be cut. The Unrated Directors Cut is loaded with excessive gore and some extra footage that was omitted from the R rated video version. The people that probably saw the R rated version are usually the most anti part II , because i'm sure this version will change their minds for the extreme gore and violence alone. There are some things I like about this movie , and other things I despise. What I like CONTRARY TO EVERYONE! is Toxie's voice..I prefer the nerdy personality voice rather than the badly dubbed deep booming voice of the first film. His personality is alot funnier and alot more lively than he was in the first film and I thought the nerd actually suited what Toxie still was mentally rather physically making it funnier but Kaufman and everyone else disagrees. What I despise is Claire played by Phoebe Legere. They changed the name of the character Sara into Claire because she was a different actress.. Sara who was played by the gorgeous and sweet Andree Maranda was alot better..since they couldnt get Miranda they got Legere who plays it as annoying 80's trash slut. Not only is she really not as innocently portrayed  as Sara, her personality made my damn teeth grind..I kept hoping Toxie would just crush her head or something..yeah and she's blind???..she sure seems to focus on a characters face ya know..but acting in a Troma movie shouldnt require that but damn..I really hated her.*probably spoilers* Toxie is depressed since he's cleaned up crime in Tromaville despite nearly being blown to bits by Apcolypse Inc run by the evil chairman (Rick Collins) taking down his army of thugs and goons. They trick Toxie into going to Japan to find his long lost father and what insues is hillarious moments of locals being frightend by the hideously deformed creature . Toxie saves a cute Japanese girl from thugs , and she helps him find his father leading him to Big Mac Bunko a sumo wrestling thug smuggling cocaine in fish. Yeah he meets a gorey death...and what follows is sorta a pointless car chase scene that really didn't belong..and then the door opens for the remainder of the chapter in Part III. I guess you should see this movie..and all the Toxic Avenger movies..I liked it..just don't expect a huge classic like the first one..but the bad reviews this movie usually gets is undeserving.

First of all I couldn't understand how Troma were willing to change so much about the movie when the first one was so excellent. First of all Melvin appears to have shrunk somewhere in the region of 9-12 inches, his voice is about two octaves higher, none of the original cast are present (even though it had only been 5 years). Most shockingly I thought though was the way that Troma had completely changed the style of the movie. Whereas Toxic 1 had been humurous, gory and genuinely had a 'so bad its good' feel to it, Toxic 2 appears to have gone for a slapstick, comic book feel which totally sucks. Instead of decapitations, and arm ripping from the first movie, we are 'treated' to comedy sound effects, spinning heads and what I can only call a kids or family film. Very disappointing by Tromas standards. It's not all bad though, there are some genuinely funny parts to the movie. More complaints now, why was it deemed neccessary to have Toxie narrate throughout the entire movie? Why is his new girlfriend so annoyingly poor actress even by Tromas standards? When you watch it the second and third times it does get better I guess its just the initial shock of the complete u-turn that they have taken since the first movie. After seeing it a couple of times now I recommend that you give it a shot and make your own mind up on this movie. This movie is not half as good as the first one but is twice as good as the third installment.

And crazy films are brilliant. It's nice to sit down and watch a film which is a total joke.The Toxic Avenger battles the evil Apocalypse Inc. corporation and the evil Big Mac Bunko-and there's plenty of crazy situations throughout.The Toxic Avenger is the ugliest hero ever with a blind girlfriend. He fights the good fight against evil throughout the film.The best bit is the beginning where a car pulls up by Toxie's home. Dozens of guys pile out of the car to battle Toxie. That was the first thing that made me laugh. How they all fit into one limousine is beyond me? And they were truly weird guys. There was some guy with a dogface, another guy dressed as a woman and other weird characters.Toxie despatched them all with ease. He decapitated two guys, he twisted one guy into a basketball and he made one guy's head spin round with one punch. It looked like he was going to meet his match at one point when this tall Martial Arts guy came to fight but Toxie was spared when the bad guy realised he had a piano lesson due to start.After the battle Toxie went over to Japan for more madcap mayhem. I won't spoil what happened but it will have you laughing throughout.Long live the Toxic Avenger!

But then I watched it again and realised how funny it was. Thus, I bought Toxic Avenger two or, as I lovingly call it, Toxie In Tokyo. THis movie really looks like a comic book. Peoples heads spin, gangs of bad guys (and I mean gangs as in 30 people) continusaly pile out of a limosine. Toxie is now a little sillier, and I think they knew what kind of movie they were making. This could double as something on Cartoon Network without all the violence. Basicly, The first super human from New Jersey goes to find his father in Tokyo. Great stuff.

When the first film is so good the makers of the next film have a real challenge on their hands. However, some sequels are actually superior to the first film. Many would agree that 'The Empire Strikes Back' is better than the first 'Star Wars. The first 'Toxic Avenger' is a film that practically screamed sequel by the end and Troma would deliver, but not for a few years. The wait however would be worth it because the makers of part II really went all out so they could give us around 100 minutes of pure weird entertainment.Pros Cast is game. Fun score and catchy theme song. Excellent special and make-up effects, many of which are quite gruesome. Paces zips right along. A lot of hilarious moments and lines of dialogue. Bursting with creative vitality, like the death scenes for instance. High camp all the way. Filmmakers do a great job of taking new chances rather than copy the original.Cons Again not much on plot. The opening fight sequence is fun, but really drawn out. Though it's not supposed to be realistic, some of the acting really is too amateurish.Final thought I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I like this sequel more than part 1. It's more consistently entertaining, is less restrained, and takes the idea further. Sure it's totally silly and not an example of great filmmaking, but it accomplishes what it set out to and that's entertain. It's also quite funny if you're in the right mood.My rating 4/5 "},{"Title":"So bad that it is not good!","Date":"14 August 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":" The first movie was bad but it still had over the top plot that was a lot of fun and some decent deaths scenes in that movie, it kind flowed really well, I was never got bored with the first movie.

Troma works the formula well in a lot of their movies,not so much with the movies they pick up and release. The original Toxic Avenger is one of my all time favorite movies, right along with Troma's Terror Firmer (love that movie). This sequel is not all that bad. It delivers the witty gore and goof ball humor you would expect from Troma. Nowhere near as good as the original, but miles ahead of Part 3. The down-fall with this movie is that Toxie himself is cheesier here then he was in Part 1, which took away from his character. Still, this is a good Troma product, and should be seen only in it's unrated form. Features a man getting chopped up, elderly person blown-up in wheel-chair, naked women, and a horse hit by a truck (a scene that freaked me out when I saw this on the USA Network in the middle of the afternoon over a decade ago). Watch out for the plot inconsistinances which are everywhere in this (especially Melvin's (The Toxic Avenger) un-explained last name change, as well as his girlfriends first name switcheroo).

TOXIC AVENGER 2 takes itself too seriously with it's half-way decent acting, dramatic music, big-budget, and wait a sec. Troma actually tried incorporating a complex storyline into it too!  Also, Toxie's mask was incredibly fake looking and his voice was very wimpy sounding!  I can't for the life of me understand why they'd change his voice from being deep and sinister sounding to this now girly voice.OK so it isn't all bad.  Some of the jokes and gags (while forced) did make me laugh a bit and if you see the true uncut version it's loaded with some serious gore.  I loved the bad cheesy gore in the first movie, but in this one the gore is both realistic and sickening.  Oh and his new blind girlfriend is a lot hotter than the old one (if not goofier too).

Since force seems to have failed they send him on a wild goose chase to Japan to find his father. Eventually, Toxie gets wise though, and returns to destroy big business for good.Throughout this picture it seems as though the film was shot and then the directors tried to edit together a movie however they could. Yet, this only adds to the films charm. Furthermore, The Toxic Avenger, Part II features a cast of hundreds (mainly local non-actors I believe), who are for the most part hilarious.
