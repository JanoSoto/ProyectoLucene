It's also one of my favourite films of all time. Which is not to say it's a perfect ten, it isn't. But it's a great combination of good cheeze and pure fun. Suspend all disbelief, it's not about realism. And try not to nitpick (we all know graphics would not have been possible using Unix, we all know that those archaic modems couldn't run that fast, etc. etc. etc.)That aside, this film is really funny. It also laughs at itself on a regular basis...I mean just look at dade's wardrobe, and then remind yourself that you know half a dozen people who dressed like that in 94. I know a people who mirror just about every character in this film, which makes it even more enjoyable.The dialogue is often over the top, and some of the acting is overdone, but tis the nature of the beast. Jonny Lee Miller (who never ceases to amaze me) pulls off the American accent quite well (though he tends to slip on occasion) and Dade is certainly no Sickboy. But that's just an example of range (he did it again in Dracula 2000...and almost saved it). Matthew Lillard, though occasionally OVERLY annoying, is perfect as Cereal Killer; his best role ever, though Scream comes close. Renoly Santiago is a funny and loud Phantom Phreak, a role only second to his role in Con Air, and his lines are always great; and Laurence Mason as the ultra-cool Lord Nikon a very close tie with Tin-Tin in The Crow for coolness (and he's done some *cool* spots...Floyd D in True Romance (not to be confused with Brad Pitt's character 'Floyd';) and Roach in an awesome ep. of Law & Order...) his character is by far the coolest of the Elite. Lorraine Bracco in a *very* early role...and speaking of *early* - Early Edition's Fishe Stevens is amusing as the arrogant swine Eugene 'The Plague' Belford. And how can one not like a film with Penn Jillette in it???But all that aside, Angelina Jolie stole the show (as she often does). Looking like a cyber-elf straight out of ShadowRun, she's sultry and sexy in a way most actresses these days can't manage. I can't think of any films I haven't liked her in...even if I didn't like the films themselves. She's simply awesome here, she even takes bad dialogue and turns it into fun, good lines. And *her* outfits are really nice, save for that horrid dress she was stuck in at the end. And she has a Massive Attack startup on her puter!! (with a 28.8 bps modem!! ;p~~~)Overall sure it's unrealistic. Sure half of it's impossible. Sure it's overacted and the dialogue needs work. But the cast are all under-rated, and most of them went on to better roles, some to much fame. And the soundtracks are absolutely AMAZING!! I own them and listen regularly... This should probably rate a four or five, but I can't help but ignore all critics and pronounce myself as one of the large cult following of adorers of this film. For fun value, let alone the fact that it's entertaining as hell 8/10.

Coming from a programmer and a computer enthusiast, the movie was great despite all the false statements, fake guis and totally bs methods of cracking. Quite frankly if you are one of my fellow computer geeks don't expect anything close to the real deal, it would never make a good movie for the public. I think that the true movie here is behind the whole hacking front. It is the development of characters the build up of a plot and an exciting climax and satisfying denouement. In closing, don't expect a command line prompt or a true UNIX client on any of the systems because it just doesn't happen in movies. Instead watch the movie because its exciting, fun and a great throwback to the early 90's.

This isn't a new problem for filmmakers; great films of the past, from DESK SET to COLOSSUS THE FORBIN PROJECT, from DEMON SEED to TRON and THE LAST STARFIGHTER have all featured 'cutting-edge' technology that seems quaint, by today's standards. Even 'Hal', from the timeless classic 2001A SPACE ODYSSEY, is a huge monstrosity that could be miniaturized to a fraction of it's size, today. So when a film's whole theme involves computers, like THE NET, or HACKERS, you can't take the technology end too seriously, even if much of it is bogus, as is the case of Iain Softley's paean to teen-aged computer freaks. Hackers are, of course, not romantic, adventurous daredevils who are trying to right wrongs by attacking evil conglomerates via an expertise in computer programming; they are generally over-educated anarchists who create worms and viruses for the simple joy of seeing the disruption and destruction of EVERYONE'S computers, just to know that they can do it.Having said this, let me say that the true joy of HACKERS is seeing a group of young 'Stars in the Making', early in their careers. Of course the most recognizable and famous of these is Angelina Jolie, who looks butch and adorable with short hair, and 'an attitude', but the film also offers a dazzling performance by Matthew Lillard (Shaggy in the live-action SCOOBY-DOO), who has become one of the finest young comic actors around; gifted British actor Jonny Lee Miller, playing an American, here, who would go on to TRAINSPOTTING, DRACULA 2000, and the title role in the TV production of BYRON; Jesse Bradford, star of last year's CLOCKSTOPPERS; Laurence Mason (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, A.I.); and Renoly Santiago (CON AIR). Quite an impressive resume for a cast of 'unknowns' in 1995!Of course, the established actors of the film haven't done badly, either...While Fisher Stevens never became a 'major' star, after the build-up television and the SHORT CIRCUIT films gave him, he still remains active; and of course, Lorraine Bracco went on to THE SOPRANOS, as the Mafia's favorite 'shrink' (with the possible exception of Billy Crystal).So, if you skip over the dated attempt to be 'cutting edge', and just sit back and enjoy the performances, HACKERS is a fun movie that can be appreciated as a 'Preview of Coming Attractions' from a remarkable cast...

While the computer screens depicted aren't realistic so to speak (I'll get to that in a moment) it was exciting, and made computers exciting again, it also didn't hurt the fact that everyone I knew used Macs just like the Hackers in the movie, so as you can imagine, it inspired many of us to see if we had the potential to do similar things but ultimately gave up (popping in a few CD-ROM games was much more entertaining;;)  ). Anyways, now I own the film on DVD and I believe I've come to a revelation regarding the computer screens shown in the film...what we see is not what is actually happening on the screen, what they're showing us is what the hackers are doing, as visualized in their mind, they picture the data on the screen in a way in their head where it comes together, and what we see is that picture in their head, if maybe only an enhanced picture...anyways, thought I'd share that.Oh, and isn't it funny to see computer geeks drooling over a laptop with a 28.8 modem?)

Not from the actual film itself, but from the fact that Hollywood would take the sidekicks of every other action film and give them their own film. It was refreshing, even if the overall feature did not settle well. It showed that Hollywood was willing to take a step forward in the world of creativity, and for a few films it brooded well. Now in 2005, I watch this film again, and am completely devastated by the results. Now, when I watch this film, I see clichéd characters, an uninvolved plot, complete disregard for the law, and extremely cheap computer graphics, which heavily stamped a date on this feature. Is this what hacking is all about? Is hacking about fighting evil hackers with virus', about growing out-dated over time, and about finding that one Goth girl that has a boyfriend and making her your own? That is what Hackers demonstrated to me, so why shouldn't I believe it? Director Ian Softley really went outside of his tent when creating this film. Going from the feature Backbeat, about music's cultural icons, to this just doesn't &#133; well &#133; compute. He had this great opportunity to bring an unknown culture into a mainstream light, but instead he teeny-bopped it out of reality. He transforms these unsociable, outcast geniuses into superheroes, armed with nothing more than keyboards, high libidos, teen music, and an overabundance of clichés. If I were a member of the hacker community I would be outraged about this film. It is like making a movie about Superman wearing a Batman costume, two different cultures were intertwining incorrectly and nobody was there to stop it. We needed The Matrix, but all we got was American Pie. To help remedy this situation, we needed three distinct changes. We needed stronger actors to accompany their characters, a tighter story that dove deeper into the hacker culture, and we needed stronger CGI, which wouldn't date this early 90s film.Jonny Lee Miller was decent, Angelina carried her own, Jesse Bradford was wasted, but overall the most hurtful part of these characters was that they never quite gelled together. I never quite saw these main characters working together after this. I never saw them remaining friends or pursuing their computer degrees further. We opened with only enough information for us to feel sympathy for Miller and literally left with no care in the world what would happen to these characters after the credit sequence. This is not strong film-making. I like to end films with a sensation that life outside the camera will continue in a linear course, but with Hackers that sensation never erupted. I think some of this has to do with Matthew Lillard who just floundered his performance (almost to the clichéd T) and decayed nearly every scene he was involved with. The only attribute he was able to succeed with was annoying, and I don't think that is what Softley was shooting for. These characters were painful to watch and thankfully were able to rebound after this film, sans Matthew Lillard.The story. Without detailing too much, the story was unoriginal. It felt as if we took a general action film, erased the main heroes, and instead substituted this band of hipster hackers as our heroines. Which means, a very clichéd story equipped with our very own over-acting villain, The Plague. What was his role in this film outside of telling Penn Jillette what to do, and sleeping with Lorraine Bracco? His spoken words were hideous and painful to the ear, coupled with his one-dimensional character really left us with a villain that never quite covered the evil ground. Neither him nor Bracco felt evil. Instead, from the moment we met them we knew what would be their fate. There was nothing that Softley could have done to avoid this &#133; outside of making better casting decisions, a stronger story, and a decent climax.Finally, I would like to say that this film felt like the mid-90s. No matter how you look at it, the choice for graphics in this film completely dates the picture. If you think you are going to gather up your computer friends for a rousing night of micro-brews and this feature, you will find yourself definitely alone by the end of the evening. Softley's use of random letters, images, and computer-enhanced something-or-others, didn't even feel like computers. I remember playing computer games back in the 80s that made more sense than this. I felt cheapened after seeing these terminally poor graphics and wondered if this film was used to push computer companies into a better era. Either way, Softley's CGI use in this film was hysterically bad, causing a ripple of cheapness to cascade through this film.Overall, I wasn't happy with my future viewing of this film. Perhaps I should have left this film go in the 90s, but watching it today I felt cheap and robbed. Softley's inaccurate portrayal of this hacker culture only brewed a deeper dislike of Hollywood and their ability to capitalize on this unknown world. The cast was atrocious (Matthew Lillard), the story can be seen in dozens of other action-genre films, and the central focus of this film, the computer graphics, were apparently designed by Wal-Mart. Hackers is a disgraceful mess of a film that should be locked in the film vault never to be released again.Grade * out of ***** "},{"Title":"A dissenting opinion","Date":"23 September 2006","Score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" I feel compelled to offer my take on this film.

However, Sopranos Lorraine Brocco Leaves much to be desired, though that may be due to the script.2. The Music I forgot how great this soundtrack was. Massive Attack, Cirrus, and even stuff from Kruder Dorfmeister that I didn't really get into until 2002. The music alone is worth the viewing.3.

However, much of the film makes it appear hackers can target credit cards, alter traffic light systems, and issue arrest warrants at will. Certainly, hackers have done things on a large scale, such as the recent hacking of Sony Pictures Studio and Target stores. If hackers really had the ability to do all the things implied by the film, we wouldn't be able to function in the mechanized world as it is.The film begins when Dade Murphy (Jonny Lee Miller), age 11, engaged one of the most successful and damaging computer hacks in the history of internet infiltration, crashing 1500+ systems. He's sentenced to probation, his parents fined $10,000's, and he's forbidden to use a computer until age 18. Fast-forward 7 years. Now he's at a high school in New York where he meets fellow computer hackers Kate Libby, a.k.a. Acid Burn (Angelina Jolie), Ramόn Sánchez (Renoly Santiago), Joey Pardella (Jesse Bradford) and Lord Nikon (Laurence Mason). At first they see hacking as a kind of game, looking to one-up each other.Dade and Kate then decide to have a competition who can do the best hacking of one of the poor schmucks from the FBI who has been targeting hackers, Agent William Dick Gill. The stakes if she loses, she has to go on a date with him and wear a dress, or if he loses, he has to become her slave. So they begin the competition, a kind of virtual football match, in true hacking style. They invalidate his credit card, put up a porn ad in his name and give out his business phone number where NY gays and transvestites can call him. They even pull the worst trick they indicate in his file that he's deceased.It's all good fun until the youngest of the hackers, Joey, breaks into The Gibson, an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer. He notices there's a strange virus in the system and downloads some of it, putting it on a partially downloaded 3.5 floppy disk (remember those?). The FBI at the behest of their systems security analyst Eugene Belford, a.k.a. The Plague (Fisher Stevens), tracks down Joey and arrests him, but not before he hides the disk. Later, Belford and the FBI storm into Joey's house, and the systems security analyst Belford threatens Dade to give them the information they want, which is hidden on the disk. Dade declines saying he doesn't play well with others, to which Belford takes out his frustration on a piece of music equipment in Dade's bedroom. The hackers then discover a virus, which was not written by the hackers, is going to wreak havoc with the company via large cargo ships at sea. They realize the blame will most likely be put on them.While this is certainly not the best film of this type, it's a good one. Some of the visuals are stunning, and interestingly, the movie doesn't come off dated even though it was produced a couple of decades before this writing. The characters are rather interesting, depicting Generation X types who hack into computer systems, not for a living, but for fun. And I liked Fisher Stevens as the former hacker turned security analyst who understands hacker culture. This film was made from the point of view of young computer geeks of Generation X. The older generation, Boomers and Silent in other words, come off rather stilted and nondescript, which I agree is a good depiction, being a Generation X'er myself.

Amazing graphics on these PC screens didn't exist back then which IMHO made it date better than other Computer movies of its day.I liked how some scary facts about the government holding files on its people which you would be amazed today on what they hold on you. And you would be surprised just how many skimming scams are going on .... these issues hold true today.It was a more innocent time when only a select few knew how to do things and I even remember doing the tape digital sounds .... oh those where the days )Enjoy it for what it was .... oh and you get to see sexy Jolie when she was only 19 .... pretty simple story line and some truism that even today not many people would know.

Even the latest equipment looks ridiculously antique within a few years of release. There is not really anything to see -- just people sitting at keyboards. You must interpret it poetically. There is not much action. The public has no idea what is really going on.The best attempts, like Tron, work at two levels, direct action for the kids, and subtle in-jokes and metaphors for the computer savvy.Hackers has lots of energy, but it is downright silly.For a start, the techno-babble is complete gibberish. The screenwriters did not even know the difference between a modem, a screen and RAM. I think they composed the dialogue by looking up computer jargon in a dictionary and throwing the words into a hat. They make zero attempt at plausibility.This incompetence quickly destroys the illusion we are viewing whiz kids capable of bringing down civilisation as we know if they so chose.Most of the dialogue is theme and variation on I'm the king of the castle, and you're the dirty rascal. It sounds like something first graders would say. It is so juvenile, it is jarring.Another jarring thing. Dade and his mother stayed in a one-bedroom apartment where mom slept on the couch. Yet Dade had thousands of dollars to spend on clothes and hairstyling.There is a goony character called Cereal. He appears to be brain damaged, perhaps from too many drugs. Yet we are supposed to believe he took over all TV channels of earth.But the main problem with the movie was the lead Dade, played by Johnny Lee Miller. He was badly miscast. His hair was expensively bleached and each curl pressed into place. He wore a leather jacket costing thousands of dollars that Liberace might have coveted. His facial features were so sharp he could cut cheese with them, but he had no sizzle. He came across as soggy as yesterday's waffle, a sort of young Lawrence Welk. His voice was as flat as Houston astronaut ground control.Angelina Jolie did a great job with the atrocious dialogue they handed her. She was like a time bomb about to explode. It is too bad the movie was not written more around her acting skills.A touch I did like was the way the characters got around their city with dazzling speed on roller blades. It added some visual excitement and flash.Some of the CGI visuals to poetically represent hacking into computers were of course completely unrealistic, but at least interesting and metaphorically evocative.A movie is a team. The writers were incompetent though the basic plot was quite clever. Most of the actors were great. The visual effects people were ahead of their time (but of course dated now). A movie is as good as its weakest link.

'Hackers' is pretty much another teen saves the world movie, this time using technology. Although it is a teen flick, I liked that it's not heavily sugarcoated. The romance isn't overly mushy though poorly developed. The comedy aspect of it works. The pacing, especially midway, is very slow. Now the script is definitely full of holes but there is a reason why this film has achieved cult classic status. It has heart. One can easily relate to the characters. Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Fisher Stevens, Lorraine Bracco and Matthew Lillard do a good enough job. Jolie looks quite cute and sultry and Bracco is hot. However, where acting is concerned, Jesse Bradford steals the show as the youngest one in the group, the rookie, who tries to fit in. He appears spontaneous and his performance is very natural. In addition, to the good performances, 'Hackers' has an awesome soundtrack. So when one expects something unrealistic and cheesy and is not looking to nitpick, 'Hackers' can be fun.

You don't see a directory structure in a command line. They show it with a 3D look. Another sequence that shows this is the one at the party where they all stare at the laptop, and it's screen saver. It's eye candy to avoid the public from running away from it. If they did a realistic hacking movie, it would probably be very boring.

You can't hack from the top of the Empire State Building for three reasons. 1. No phone lines. 2. No wireless network. 3. You can't go to the top of the Empire State Building.

Well....(Spoilers Ahead) In 1988, an 11 year old (that's right, 11) named Dade crashes a whole bunch of Wall Street computers, and is denied the right to a use computer until his 18th birthday. Cut to 17 years later, and Dade (now played by the terrific Johnny Lee Miller) is up to his old tricks. He soon falls in with a crowd of hackers and meets Kate (Angelina Jolie), and the two of them begin the usual movie foreplay. Everyone's having fun at first, but then things get serious. It seems that a business man and former hacker (Fisher Stevens) has created a disastrous virus (which is actually a cover for a fraudulent worm program) and has decided to frame the hackers for it. So, Dade and the rest of the hackers set out to stop the virus and clear their names. End Summary. Sure this film has it's problems the obviously false computer technology and the fact that no one (particularly the adults) can tell that Stevens is a bad guy when it's so obvious. No matter.

As has been said, Hackers is a rather cute romantic movie, but it also incorporates other elements that make it so much more than a mere romance, or stick it to the Man story.  (Although the _Sleepless in Seattle_-esque lights on the building was a nice touch.)The film focuses on Dade's point of view -- including a creative take on his thoughts or emotions, in the form of clips from other movies (come on -- the scene where the woman is being strangled after the pool on the roof?). Dade's new friends -- possibly the most extreme individuals in that high school -- all have great quirks and personalities of their own.  Many a good quote comes from Cereal, or Nikon.  Admittedly, the bad guys are essentially universally under-developped, but since the story isn't about them, it's not a big problem.The soundtrack is amazing, as are a good deal of the shots in the movie (from a purely aesthetic point of view).  The buildings chosen all have great lines, and the aerial shots are interesting, if not breathtaking. As to the hacking, the coloured equations floating through space thing made what is, visually, a rather boring topic interesting in a way that didn't pretend to be realistic (a la _The Net_).  There just isn't a way to make people typing frantically interesting.  It can't be done.  So they didn't.I think that sums up what I love about this movie.

Still, the lavish (almost excessive) visual effects and the stereotypically outlandish appearance of the characters does not rescue flat, also stereotyped characters and a much-recycled plot.  The romance manages to be both predictable and unbelievable; the action follows the exact same pattern as every other youth-friendly adventure movie that came out of the 1980s.Amazingly enough, the catchphrase Crash and Burn did not turn out to be a prophetic statement about the future of the film, which is a lot better than it could have been.

In a society where everybody should suspect everybody, they are the only ones who stand up for the rights to free information. This movie is a flashy cybernetic insight into the computer sub-culture of the 90's. Excellently portrayed by fresh-faced actors such as Jonny-Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie, are the roles of two hackers at war. Crash Override, and Acid Burn. Youth is exuberant in these two fine actors, who will  go on to do bigger(but not necessarily better) things. The computer consognoti or hacker of today is as or even more heroic as an athlete winning gold at the Olympics. How, you ask? Well, how hard is it to don a pair of swimming trunks and swim up and down a pool as fast as you can? How hard is it  to crack into high-tech security of vast companies, who pay thousands to people to prevent it happening. Exactly. Plus it is much harder to think of an original handle. The youth of today are somewhat underestimated, as they are in this film. Initially triggered by Tron and later War Games, Hackers shows us the realities of today and the technological world. A technological marvel, computers were considered back in the 80's. Now, they are powerful tools used in the everyday building of modern society. And hackers, are the only ones who use them to their full potential.

It is stylized, not true of real hacking and the graphics and images (using city streets and building to represent circuitry), similar in look to some cyber parts of Johnny Mnemonic which was out the same year as well as a few other films from around the same time. It's a sexy, funny, much quotable romp with a sub-plot of romance. The main plot is mega-corporation conspiracy to hold tankers to ransom using a computer virus called Da Vinci and it's some College 'elite' hackers vs the FBI to be first to solve who is to blame and clear those who are innocent. Jonny Lee Miller is the hero of the piece and is gorgeous and confident, playing it cool and smooth opposite a young (and already stunning) Angelina Jolie often sans appropriate underwear. She is haughty and cold, and for only her first major film role completely sizzled. The chemistry between her and Miller was smoking, in art as in life.Overall the acting is a little overplayed and I feel that much of the film was tongue in cheek and not to be taken seriously, almost like a comic-strip adaptation. All the characters in the gang are larger than life from the extremely weird and intelligence-ambiguous Matthew Lillard as Cereal Killer (as in fruit loops) to the hyper 'boy wonder' Jesse Bradford as underdog-wanting-recognition Joey. Fisher Stevens plays manchild with boytoys 'The Freak' and does the role with crazy eccentricity and hubris together with his equally crazy partner in crime Margo (Lorraine Bracco) who is terminally hammy and over-the-over-the-top of everyone else but in a rather wooden and unconvincing kind of way. Look out for a young Penn Jillette (as in Penn and Teller). It's a great 90s film with a fab soundrack and wardrobe, especially Crash and Burn (Miller and Jolie), and a really exciting finale. However, whilst I like it a lot I don't think it aged well to appeal to a wider generation, but it remains a favourite of mine, which I watch every now and again for giggles and to bring back memories. That all said, the stand out message from this film is most certainly Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right!

It's not that they are bad, just strange. For instance, it is hard to believe that a gorgeous girl such as Kate (Joli) could be a computer nerd, second of all, that Matthew Lillard's character, Cereal Killer, could be that eccentric. I'm not quite sure why, but Cereal acts like a Jack Sparrow on LSD. And, ultimately, the story is a bit hard to believe as well yet fear not, my fellow movie gurus, the film is awesome.The opening scene sets up the mood automatically. You know this is going to be a serious film (Lorraine Bracco of The Sopranos is in it) and at the same time, you know you're going to laugh at it (Penn Jillete of Vegas' Penn and Teller duo is also in it); except, I don't know what to say or how you should feel about singer Marc Anthony, who randomly plays a government agent in this movie. The truth is, you pretty much know what you're going to get with director Iain Softly (K-PAX, The Skeleton Key, and Inkheart) and writer Rafael Moreu of The Rage Carrie 2.My only beef with the film is that several characters randomly disappear towards the middle of the movie and never comeback. Other than that, I loved it, and so will you. It makes me wonder, what do you think Dade and his crew would do is WikiLeaks and Facebook existed back in 1995?

The non-complex plot acts as a vehicle for character development, style, and a great soundtrack.I'm a student of computer science, so obviously I can see how shoddy the technical underpinnings of some of the material are, but honestly, that has no effect on my enjoyment of this movie. The film almost acknowledges its unrealistic use of special effects with various hints dropped throughout the movie that would be lost on laymen, like the Metropolis poster in Kate's bedroom, the mention of various (in)famous pieces of technical literature, hacking a Gibson, and Plague's use of the alias Babbage. Where it can afford to, this movie has a pretty good grasp on hacker culture, so don't crap a bird and check your petty skepticism at the door; the movie is using visual metaphors to depict the intricacies of hacking to people who wouldn't be able to understand them otherwise, and it does it in a fun, stylistic way.I have no doubt that seeing this movie at a young age cultivated my admiration for not only computing (and Angelina Jolie), but New York City as well. The film portrays the island of Manhattan as a sprawling, wired playground that never sleeps, rife with energy; a breathing invitation to stay out all night, win the girl, and hack the world around you.The DVD cover sure as hell doesn't make it apparent, but this film is about the closest (and likely best) adaptation of William Gibson's cultural fission, Neuromancer, that you'll ever find. If you enjoyed this book, seek this movie immediately, and vice versa.From the minute the flick starts, it yanks you in. Every time.

It was (is) a good old-fashioned movie about the good guys triumphing against the bad guys, having fun on the way, and getting the girl in the end.I must state that in 1997 I hadn't even looked at a PC, or even heard a single Ozzy Osbourne track.Level 2 - The 2004 enjoyment. Now with a decent knowledge of the in-jokes (Anarchist Cookbook references, Ozzy Osbourne, etc) I enjoy it on the level of inside looking out - I understand that the virus's are insane, that you cannot view PCs as huge tower blocks (although I'm sure some GUI will have that capability) etc. I also understand that this is symbolism, and for a few hours, I can switch off the part of my brain that hates newbies pretending they can hack because they got some tewls. I can enjoy this film, I can understand the cultural references, I can love Mathew Lillard's acting, and above all, I can watch this movie time and time again.Hell I am watching it the now, and it will always be in my top 5 list of favourite films.So yes, I can see how the film might irritate 'true' hackers, but save that angst for the newbs. Watch this film for what it is - a film. And I think you might find it is a good FILM.Unless you absolutely despise teenagers/computers/people talking in a language you wont understand. In which case don't bother.For me, it is a 10/10, but for many it could be a 0/10. All I can say is watch it for yourself, and build your own opinions.

The NSA provides SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), the CIA analyzes that information, The Secret Service has two jobs anti-counterfeiting and VIP protection, not arresting Hackers or crackerz. There are some accuracies in the film, so I would agree that the writer knew something, not a lot, but some. The speed with which a trace was made is accurate, a modem will take maybe 10sec to trace to the source, a LAN only 5sec. if this film was made in 2004 it would probably be the (B)OHS doing the investigating. In fact the hackers wouldn't have been redflagged anyway would they? the real reason for the secret service is the name.

Coming from the culture this film is loosely based on it's terribly painful to watch due to three factors.  One is the computer interfaces they use.  Maybe they'd be okay if this was set many decades into the future, but with it being set in 1995 it just doesn't fly; very cartoonish.  Another is the glorification of this culture as one which works solely for the freedom of information.  Crackers as they're supposed to be called (a hacker is a programmer, a cracker is a person who breaks into those programs) are in most cases bored 16 year old kids just wanting to cause trouble.  The third, and the one which bothers me the most, is the horribly cheesy dialog.  Time and again words are grabbed from hacker dictionaries, tossed into a blender on puree, then poured out into the film.  It's so bad at times it actually made me cringe.On the upside it has Angelina Jolie, and good performances from the rest of the good guys.  Fisher Stevens and Lorraine Bracco are pretty bad in the roles of the evil cracker and his, uh, girlfriend I guess.  Bracco is wooden at best, and Stevens waffles between dead serious and some kind of comic charicature.

It's about people living on the fringe of society, who express themselves through a connection to the electronic world.The storyline is simple, a young man is found guilty on his 11th birthday of using a virus to infect multiple network systems and causing them to crash. Subsequently, he is put on a probation that restricts him from owing or operating a computer & touch tone telephone. Fast forward to his 18th birthday, and after a broken family, a move to New York with his mother, and a change of schools; he falls into a group of people who live as Hackers. After one of them inadvertently copies incriminating data from a Mineral Company computer, the company's head of computer security hatches a plan to track them down. With a couple of plot twists, and a Good/Evil story, its an easy watch. Angelina Jolie even briefly gets her nipples onto film for the first time.The downside comes in the fact that the characters are very one dimensional. It's hard to engage with them, as they all seem to be trying so hard to be interesting and edgy. The computer jargon thrown into the dialogue is appropriate for the time frame of the movie, but it really has not aged well. Its a mess of bad cliché and cheesy one-liners that creates a nasty cringe factor.Using New York as a backdrop, the film is shot nicely, giving a gritty urban feel, and allowing it to seem larger in scope than the sum of its parts. However, with wooden acting & delivery, the characters seem to fade into the background, not taking advantage of the settings they find themselves in.The low rating is more for the poor acting, lackluster dialogue and cut'n'paste storyline. This, though, does not mean its a bad film. Hackers has a great soundtrack, with quirky tracks that work perfectly for the material. It also seems to work on a visceral level, providing entertainment and laughs that it wasn't really intending.The best bet is to turn your brain off, grab some popcorn, and (if you have a passing knowledge of computers) have some belly laughs at the utter cheese of it all.

Just reading the reviews here at IMDB, it can be seen that many people have quite an affection for this piece of cinematic garbage.  Let me set the record straight this film is a complete waste of time.  After watching it, I felt really bad about losing an hour and a half of my life that could've been spent doing something more worthwhile.Even if you try to keep an open mind about how unrealistic the film is, the movie just does not work on any level whatsoever.  This movie is not fun in any way.  The performances by the actors ranged from average to sub-par.  The only redeeming aspect of this movie is when you catch a 3-second overhead shot of Angelina Jolie in a see-thru shirt.  Besides that, this movie is the equivalent of a dung heap.  It's one of those movies that takes itself way too seriously, and tried too hard to be hip and cool.When my friend raved to me about how cool the movie was before showing it to me, I was hyped up, and expecting an intelligent movie with cool special effects and a convincing storyline.  Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Instead, I'm treated to a handful of goofily-dressed, shallow characters who I am somehow supposed to believe are a bunch of bad-assed computer hackers, and am dragged along through a really tired and cliche plot.  The director was so careless in his handling of the plot and characters, that one of the relatively main characters (Ramon) gets arrested about mid-way thru the film and disappears for the remainder of the movie, without a follow-up or explanation as to what happens to him.  Sadly, I didn't even really care. The effects for the computer displays were pretty sorry and unconvincing, too.  I might have excused this if the film was made in the 80s, but this was the mid-90s, folks.  I especially laughed at the effects for the supercomputer, with the 3D operating system that made no coherent sense whatsoever.I have a feeling that the director intended to blow away the audience with his vision of coolness, by trying to take a really hip concept (computer hackers) and appeal to a wide teenage crowd by dumbing it down, so that the masses would understand it and not be turned away by it's computer-driven theme.

When he was 9 years old, Dade crashed computers all over the world.  He was caught, and his sentence was, among other things, the inability to own a computer, or a use a phone for `hacking' purposes until the day of his 17th birthday. Fast-forward to his birthday, and he and his mother have since moved, and Dade now knows no one, and cleverly introduces himself to Kate Libby known to her friends as `Acid Burn'.Hackers is a movie about a group of friends who are framed for setting up an oil tanker to spill over into the ocean, which is owned by a company that employs Eugene Belford or `The Plague' played by Fisher Stevens.  Eugene has framed the group of hackers to throw off the powers that be to his illegal embezzling of his company's money.The story is well written, and the choice of actors was well thought out.  Newcomer Jonny Lee Miller (Dade Murphy) is perfect as the `leader' of the group.  The always beautiful and newly recognized Angelina Jolie (Kate Libby) is perfect as the love interest of Dade, and plays this role perfectly.  The always funny and crazy Matthew Lillard completes the cast of hackers.As good as this movie is, you can really tell that they had a very small budget, and they rushed to put it together.  The editor of the movie must have been sick the day he was supposed to screen it because it is full of mistakes, and scenes that are clearly out of order.

I don't even need to explain myself, but as a previous reviewer so brilliantly realized, was that the screen-saver-like images that pop up on the screen are actually what they see in their minds; the pieces of a puzzle coming together. I think it's brilliant; I've never seen that tactic used in a film before. And even if the images weren't meant to be a digital composite of the hackers' minds, I don't care. The computer nerds don't have to watch this film.Hackers is total cult potential and cooler than most other cult films. It's a really funny flick; Angelina Jolie is probably getting better at acting in dramatic roles, but in my opinion, this is her BEST type of role. Sassy. Smart. Buff, but ballsy. Rabid, but cute! Short-haired...... She's in her element here. Ihad (AND I AM TOTALLY SERIOUS) absolutely NO earthly IDEA that Johnny Lee Miller was a Brit. He pulls off such a good Seattle accent here. I loved the Hispanic who played Phreak, he was so cool. Then, of course, there's Matt Lillard, and the others. But nothing next to Angelina Jolie. She is perfect in her techno hair, flare, and attitude.

The technical aspects of the film might be called quaint by today's standards. Of course it is always difficult to create drama on film when most of the action is someone typing on a keyboard. The answer is usually to offer graphic (mis)representations of the internal actions. And maybe to project screen images onto the faces of the typists. This film never generates much heat. The impending catastrophe never feels like it is of consequence. The hackers and their enemies have a conflict that could be described as cute.The primary actors are all young kids. Seeing Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller in the lead roles offers the greatest joy in Hackers. In 2013, Jonny Lee is now playing Sherlock Holmes in TV's Elementary and doing a great job. Angelina has turned in some very acting since Hackers and is now an icon of American cinema and culture.Dated stories do not have to feel dated. Consider Wargames with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy. That story is not just about computer activities; it has a very human story that drives the action. Unfortunately, Hackers does not have that much depth.

Still, the story was interesting enough and the characters were actually pretty interesting and sympathetic. Even the villain, a fellow computer-geek working for the man was decent in a nefarious Steve Urkel kind of way.The only sour point really was the inclusion of Matthew Lillard. Don't get me wrong I don't hate him as an actor I just hate the parts he was type-cast to play, i.e. annoying sidekicks who scarf down junk food while yelling dude. The very fact that the principle cast was saved by him is indication enough you shouldn't take the movie seriously. Still for every Matthew Lillard there is a pre-Tomb Raider (2001) Angelina Jolie.

Admittedly, not the best you've ever seen, but overall, it does have an atmosphere you can't but like. It's a romanticized view of hackers, depicting them as a cool subculture not harming anyone, but also showing the potential threat they can become. Although an older film, the computers they used at the time were more or less up to date, which is all the more credit to them (compared with the simple mistake made in Simone). I absolutely like Angelina Jolie in the role of Acid Burn. She's so much more natural than in her later films, but already shows the tough chick personality and spirit so well known from her later performances. Johnny Lee Miller (probably best known from Trainspotting, at least to me) isn't too bad either. There is chemistry between them. Matthew Lillard does what he can do best be the most flamboyant character in the film. You can't but love him. The plot is simple and well known, someone has to clear their name for something they didn't do. As for the soundtrack, it fits seamlessly in with the atmosphere the film breathes, and consists of Orbital, Prodigy and Urban Dance Squad, amongst others.

The cheesy romance between Dade (Johnny Lee Miller) and Kate (Angelina Jolie) works surprisingly well, and the performances are impressive throughout. There is a sense of union and camaraderie that is generated between the characters, which is impressive because they don't just throw something into the dialogue about how long they've been friends. Consider the scene where Ramon taps the phone to get the operator and secretly dial his friend - It's in that place where I put that thing that time!Everyone involved very easily passes as genuine computer geeks, although the movie also commits that early sin of having images from the computers projected onto the faces of the users, so you can watch text and pictures crawling up their faces and they stare at the screens, a goofy invention similar to the tendency - which persists to this day - of having any kind of computer or stopwatch usage being accompanied by lots of clicks and beeps, I suppose to remind the audience that something is happening or about to happen. But the computer stuff in the movie is really beside the point, which is good because it's so outlandish. Like WarGames, Hackers will have you believe that any kid with an internet connection can hack into government mainframes and cause a global crisis, financial or otherwise. The story is about the characters, which is good because they are well-developed, in most cases, while much of the rest of the movie is not. There is a clever villain who is not so much a villain as much as another hacker who happens to have different objectives. He has some smart lines (Never fear, I is here.), and the rivalry between him and the main characters provides for some great scenes. Besides being a curiosity piece about some well known actors at early points in their careers, Hackers is a smart technological thriller that takes wild creative liberties with the capabilities of a still- emerging technology, but makes it into quite a fun ride.

Cyberspace is not like the Lawnmower Man, and I wish Hollywood would stop portraying it that way. The casting of this movie is what really shines. I am a big fan of Miller, who plays Dade Murphy. He was brilliant in Trainspotting and his co-star is a better than usual Angelina Jolie. Rounding out the cast is Matt Lillard(Scream), Fisher Stevens (Short Circuit), Laurence Mason (the Crow), Jesse Bradford(Swimfan). Renoly Santiago(Con Air) & Lorraine Bracco(Sopranos). The cast seems to be having fun, which helps the audience to have some, as well. The direction is well paced and fluent. Director Iain Softley, who had directed 1994's Backbeat, did a good jobs of handling the far-fetched plot. The cinematography and set design was also well done.

I've read the story is more about the lead characters' romance, but all the effects drowned out such possibility of intimacy.  They put in too much multimedia and then there's this weird TV/reality flashes. The climax is laughable as the heroes who are hacking the enemy corporation looked like they don't know how to remove a screensaver.  There was a interesting scene where the bad guy says we are samurai.  Unfortunately, the villain was the samurai.  Very cheesy too when Dade, the hero, becomes reluctant to get involved with saving one of his friends.  After giving the living hell out of a poor Secret Service Agent, you'd think this is any different.  This is probably my problem with the characters, they live to be anti-establishment. Of course they have big egos because of this.  No one person who maintains a network of computers likes these people for very good reasons.    I think the writers should go back to the samurai analogy and make the samurai, the good guy.  Dade caused economic chaos, someone could get hurt like the traffic light switchings at the end of the movie.  Stopping the oil tanker from sinking can be taken as a sign of redemption.  Angelina Jolie wore an interesting dress in the end.

It stars Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Jesse Bradford, Matthew Lillard, Laurence Mason, Renoly Santiago, Fisher Stevens and Lorraine Bracco. Music is scored by Simon Boswell and Guy Pratt and cinematography by Andrzej Sekula. Young Dade Murphy (Miller) gets banned from touching a computer again until his 18th birthday because of a infamous hacking stunt. Moving to New York with his mum, Dade meets like-minded techno heads at his new school. When one of them hacks into a scam masterminded by The Plague (Stevens), the gang find themselves framed and have to not only clear their names, but also avert computer catastrophe.I desperately don't want to be one of this middle aged squares who frowns at teenagers, I consistently worry about the widening generational gap. Yet Hackers is irritating beyond compare, a film that, were I a teenage techno geek, would probably be on my epic favourites list. The 90s saw a rush of cyberspace/computer based thrillers, think The Net, Antitrust, The Lawnmower Man et al, none of which had the savvy nous or intelligence of War Games a decade earlier or Sneakers from 92. The main problem with Hackers is that it forgoes plot in favour of bombarding the viewer with techno babble and flashy visuals, it thinks it's being immeasurably cool by having this bunch of genius hacker kids (who conveniently all go to the same school) take on the establishment, but it's desperately shallow and comes off as an excuse to showcase some pretty young things in a world that the writers know nothing about.Computer based crime is very real, now more than ever, and it's frightening, but this never comes to the fore here, the peril is preposterous and pushed to the sidelines. In fact the only thing scary here is Matthew Lillard's pig-tail plats! Softley, who made the rather great Backbeat, is more content with MTV style coolness than making his film stand on its own thematic two feet. It's all very colourful, but even the gorgeous colour only serves to make this teen hacker world seem like a space age cartoon, the fashions more at home in an episode of The Jetsons. If it was Softley and the writer's intention to create an alien teen world, one that the adults are bemused by, then that would be impressive, but I really don't think it's that at all, especially since it rings so false. The young actors are enthusiastic, but that's about it, leaving Fisher's villain to hog the limelight, while Bracco is woeful.I can dig fanciful entertainment and spandex, but I'd also like a bit of substance with my eye orgasms too, Mr Softley.

I certainly wouldn't. Heck, I won't even tell most of my non-geek friends how to look at the Registry. People don't know what they're doing as it is without giving them the means to screw things up _really_ bad. You don't give a small child a sharp knife and expect them to cut their food rather than themselves, right? Zheezh!My first watch of the film occurred while I was taking Cisco classes a couple years ago. A friend in my class was astounded that I'd never seen it. He said it was a staple of our diet. Well, it's certainly a fun movie to watch and analyze if you enjoy the field and can understand the terminology. The special effects are pretty cool IMO and very intuitively geared toward people who see circuits everywhere they go - the city turning into a circuit board, for example... I was startled to see that occur just as I was thinking the same thing! The typical moviegoer might get some fun out of this movie, too, even if doing some head-scratching, and the effects might not be true to what real computers are like but they certainly are neat and give a good interpretation of what it's like to be thinking inside the box (literally).Hackers was the first real movie (other than Star Trek movies of course) that I ever truly paid attention to since realizing I wasn't alone in my love for computers. Before watching it I didn't care about watching TV because it was a waste of my valuable computer time. Now, however, I understand the value behind such entertainment. Since this movie I've come to love a few other staples such as Lord Of The Rings, Tron, The Matrix, SwordFish, and of course the classic for all of us stuck in small spaces fighting with stupid copiers and arrogant bosses, Office Space.Regardless of whether you're geared toward computers or not, though, I'd highly recommend this movie. It's a fairly good introduction into the whole concept of the hacker mindset (insatiable curiosity, obsession with working out problems) and the whole techno subculture (or whatever it's called). Looking at it from a nontechnical person's standpoint, it's a fun story about a bunch of good but misunderstood kids who stick together to bring down those who would otherwise manipulate the general public and thwart the minority just to get away with something unethical. And, it also helps to point out that there are indeed two types of hackers in real life - the white hat variety (such as the kids in the movie) and the black hat types (more commonly known as crackers). The media today has soooooo badly corrupted the word hacker that one can't even mention the word in some places without immediately being labelled as suspect. You definitely don't want to let it slip out at work, especially if you work with computers!Me, I'd watch it just to see that finger armor on Angelina's finger and daydream about wearing it myself. Unfortunately, they simply don't make that type of jewelry in size 6. Ugh. One of these days I'll get into metalworking and make my own. HACK THE PLANET!!

This film is such a beauty, I started watching it for the second time, just minutes after the end titles rolled down my screen... Now, what makes this picture a masterpiece? After a quick summary of the story, I shall give my answer.Dade, an 11 year old hacker, breaks into some Wall Street computers and causes major agitations within the authorities, and after being captured by the Secret Service, he's sentenced a no computer ban until he reaches the age of 18. Well, this doesn't stop our young hero - when one of his new hacker friends at his last year at high school fall for the temptation of cracking into a high tech super machine, we are thrown into an inferno of nasty digital war, as he and his group are fighting an evil twisted hacker, named The Plague. I won't reveal what they are battling for, though, that might crack the tension.The reason for my raptures about this movie is practically the unique mood that is created by use of a smooth plot, good acting, some crispy special effects and, last but not least, the smashing music that adds that feeling of coolness during the entire ride. Here you'll find everything from digitally inspired techno to magnificent guitar riffs, all in step with the visual action. I should also mention that the film has it's wits. The foreplay between Dade and his female opponent are quite an amusement, even though it's pretty standard film jokes that are being served.The best thing about Hackers, though, is the feeling of power and curiosity that are radiated during this picture, and that is, in my opinion, what makes it's deadly sexy. It's quite a thrill going into the role of the hackers, experiencing their feeling of balancing on the edge of total control and fatal surrender.The plastic knots at the key board might be tiny, yet the actions they're capable of launching, are infinite, beyond the comprehension of the human brain...Summing up, I simply loved this film from the first time I heard it's title, then, when I finally got to see it, my expectations was confirmed.

Now living in New York, Dade gets back into hacking and meets a new network of people into the same thing. When one of them is arrested for hacking a system belonging to Eugene Belford, evidence of Eugene's plot to steal money from his employers comes out and, as he rushes to cover his tracks, Eugene forces Dade to get back into the saddle.When this film came out in 1995 I had just moved to England from Northern Ireland and I had just started using the internet for the first time, becoming a regular users of the net and discovering the uses of email and such that had not been available to me in my school. Against that background, maybe Hackers would have seemed cool, high-tech and exciting. Now in 2005 what strikes me about this film is how dated it all seems and how the idea of teenage shut-ins writing viruses in their bedrooms just seems annoying rather that coolly counter-culture. With this problem in it, it really needed a strong narrative to prevent it fading with every passing year and every new technological advancement; sadly the plot is too basic and relying on charm and energy to carry it through a basic plot. The film is vaguely comic and this energy does help a bit but not enough to cover a plot which started life as a very simple frame and never got any further than that.The direction tries so hard to be cool and out there that it hurts; the presentation of hacking is fiction and it isn't helped by how unrealistic it looks now, never mind then. The cast try their best to be young, hip and sexy and they just about succeed apart from some of them being very grating. Miller is relatively normal and cool and he is pretty good; Jolie is sexy as always but she looks too old for the role even though I'm sure she wasn't. Stevens and Bracco ham it up the best they can but never convince as an actual threat although Pierce is at least slightly amusing. Of the rest of the cast most just run around like slightly annoying teenagers however they come across as very complex and interesting characters in the face of yet another annoying performance from Lillard. I don't want to be too hard on the guy but he'd better hope that they keep making Scooby Doo films because that is the only thing I've seen him in where I've liked him.Overall this is not a terrible film but it is just an OK one that doesn't really do anything that well despite not doing anything badly. The novelty value of seeing how quaint it all looks now is of some interest but really it is only an average film that will become more dated and more forgotten with every passing year and every new version of Windows.

This predates the modern WWW by about five years, so there was little information that could have been gotten this way (at least, SENSITIVE information).Okay, I won't harp on about the technological realism, but I still find a movie full of fake techno-speak mumbo-jumbo to be extremely annoying.

These hackers log into computers they're not supposed to, with modems, and then all of a sudden, the Secret Service is after them?? Computer security is NOT the jurisdiction of the Secret Service; it would be the FBI and the NSA that would be after you.This movie also fails to explain why Crash Override has to move to New York City in the first place, and, without placing following events into any realistic context, he just *happens* to run into Phantom Phreak at his new high school and is whisked into this local hacker underground that takes place at some mid-90's cyber hangout that represents no subculture I have ever heard of.

For example, when the characters type on the keyboard, a echoing sound affect is added which is extremely funny. Also, when they show a virus, it is graphical and it talks and interact with you, which is extremely funny. The last thing that made me laugh was the actual techno talk that they do. It is almost funny and hysterical as most people know something about computers and they know most of the techno talks in this movie are complete blabbing of the mouth. Finally, it seems that this movie is bent on the fact that hackers can take over TV networks and make shows appear in the wee hours of the morning and make traffic lights turn red and turn on sprinklers at certain times. Almost funnier is that the movie is bent on the fact that all hackers are from MIT and that any hacker must go to that school in order to be elite.The one thing I found unusual is that at the time of this movie, laptop computers weren't exactly cheap like they are now. If I remembered correctly, laptops can cost upwards to 2-3 thousands dollars at the time, and I seriously doubt that highschool students (as portrayed in this movie) can just go out and buy one. I also find it odd that the movie portrays hackers take their crimes at payphone boots with laptops and all sorts of hookups to conceal their identity. I even find it more odd that there is a subculture where every hackers know each other. In this movie, it's like, Do you know a hacker named Acid Burn, and then suddenly everyone knows who it is.One thing this movie is true is the fact that nearly all casual hackers are teens (someone who is in highschool). Rarely do you hear hackers who are in their late 30s or 40s. I must say that based on real life cases, the most destructive hackers are the one who goes to college, whereas, the ones who stalks and terrorizes individuals are teens.Overall, I am pleased with the movie. Even though the movie is far from anything technical, it captures the culture of hacking. Namely the clothing style and the attitude are very true to someone who is techno (not exactly a hacker, but someone who really likes computers).

Because of this many stigmatize hackers to the geek and the kid who never sees the light of day. Hackers shows us something a little different which in many ways is refreshing. As far as the use of computers in the film, there is nothing that movie showed that couldn't be done in real life. Many of the so called hacker culture use many variants of Linux and Free BSD, and in most of these operating systems the GUI can be customized quite a bit (example Symphony Linux, currently in alpha testing.) I felt the movie conveyed what it wanted to show. There are hackers out there and not all of them are bad. The acting in the film was somewhat above the average. Yes there were a few spots where Johnny Lee Miller's accent came through but most of the time he held a very good American accent. Many of the techno jargon thrown around in the film was very good, and believe it or not many techno junkies talk about things like that as common conversation.All in all the film was an awesome attempt at showing many what the hacker culture may be, as many of us do not really know, and also that even in todays world there are those in power that can exploit these capabilities. I loved the film and watch it repeatedly because it reminds me the era and culture I came from.

Knowing where each one came from upon their entrance onto the screen made me feel like I really knew them.

In this movie, Jolie's character, Kate, really isn't crazy about Miller's character, Dade. In fact,she hate him. But Dade has a obsession with her. Later on in the movie, Kate shows some compassion for him and then at the end of the movie, they're a couple. This is where they both met for the first time, and then later on got married. A year later they seperated and in 1999,they divorced. The best parts of this movie is when Dade is NOT thinking about Kate sexually,or other wise the Love scenes(when i say Love scenes i mean when Dade thinks about Kate, or when Kate thinks about dade, or when they just dream about each other, etc.).

The movie just *looks* great (especially on DVD - check out the great use of colours!), has a killer rave/techno type soundtrack (which has to date spawned no less than 3 CD albums - all highly recommended, BTW) and features an eccentric bunch of interesting characters. Matthew Lillard immediately comes to mind, but also Jonny Lee Miller (from Trainspotting fame), Angelina Jolie, and many others. And as someone else mentioned, even the bad guy is fun, in a way.A common criticism on this film seems to be that is isn't realistic.Well, D'UH! -)It should be *obvious* the people who made this movie weren't going for the realistic approach. Instead, the movie paints a more symbolic picture.For once, computer users aren't depicted as complete nerds (read complete retards) but instead as rather cool, hip & interesting (and, yes, likeable) people.And yes, I know about the distinction between crackers & the real hackers. Most if not all of the characters could arguably be categorised under both categories (since they know how to crack systems, but also happen to really know programming languages, hardware, etc..) So for all intents & purposes, I have no problem with labelling them as hackers.By the way, if you want to learn more about real hackers, check out Steven Levy's classic book Hackers, which - once again - is highly recommended.Anyway, this movie is highly recommended as fast-moving entertainment. It is not a real portrait of any real hackers - nor is it supposed to be - but rather a feel-good movie, one of those films you can see over and over again, and just enjoy.

These brave and noble men and women are the truest American heroes of them all, and instantly draw comparison to the samurai of feudal Japan.  Bound by their, Cyber Bushido, They only use their abilities to protect the weak and innocent from tyrrany and oppression of large industry conglomerates, and looming, lurking offices of the goverment, and are not deserving of the metaphorical mental image of being mugged by Steve Urkel, that has been propogated by the mass media.  So finally, their critics have received their comeuppance, in this masterpiece of celluloid retribution.  The young and talented cast has an easily seen affection for the material, and have obviously done their research.  Fisher Stevens attacks his role with a fervent gusto that hasn't been seen from him since Short Circuit, and it is his deftly nuanced performance that makes his character all too real, and anchors the picture.  Also turning in top-notch performances are Jonny Lee Miller as the Newbie to this Loyal 47 Ronin-esque group, and a salad-days Angelina Jolie, as his elusive love interest.  They're performances burn white-hot with the intensity and impetuousness of youth.  Well-scripted, well-acted, and well-filmed, Hackers is a truly groundbreaking work, which could easily keep company with Rashomon or Fellini Satyricon in the lexicon of classic world cinema.  "}]
