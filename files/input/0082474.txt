It also has great support from the comic greatness of John Cleese, Joan Sanderson, Jack Warden, Robert Morley and Peter Falk.Diana Rigg and Charles Grodin (in his best movie) manage to hold the central human characters together, up against the bright lunacy of the Muppets.

I am 23 and I still need to view this movie at least once a year. Jim Henson was at the height of his creative powers when this was made, and it shows brilliantly. As opposed to The Muppet Movie, the songs aren't as dated, and the celebrity cameos have been cut back which lessens the distraction from the Muppets themselves. The cameos of John Cleese, Sir Peter Ustinov, Sir Robert Morley, and Jack Warden all are funny and fit the plot's movement. The highest performance praise though, must go to Dame Diana Rigg and Charles Grodin, who may have deserved an Academy Award for being the only human ever to attempt to make love to Miss Piggy! (Miss Piggy, don't put a wall between us...we could have had the world on a silver platter) I also love the music, especially the number in the Dubonett Club, which harkens back to the old-time musicals, with just a hint of satire. Even after seeing The Score and Ocean's 11, the Muppet heist scene is still the most entertaining I've ever seen!

This was all done before we had CGI but it works. I can't figure out how they did it--and I don't want to know. Acting is very good. Rigg is having a whale of a time in her role and it rubs off on the audience. Grodin appears drugged but it DOES fit his character.

Another very entertaining movie almost from beginning to end with only a slightly underwhelming opening number and partially amusing newspaper office scene with Jack Warden the only minor blips. Otherwise, Jim Henson as director keeps things entertaining throughout especially when he has Miss Piggy do her tribute to Esther Williams and when he has the whole Muppet gang on bikes which was impressive enough in the last movie when only Kermit was doing it. Oh, and how awesome to have seen him in a very recognizable cameo in the nightclub scene! It's during that scene that the Oscar-nominated song, The First Time It Happens is performed. It lost to the just as good Best That You Can Do from the original Arthur. In fact, all the songs by composer-lyricist Joe Raposo have such a feel good quality that you'll want to listen to them over and over again. No surprise knowing he was the resident Seseme Street songwriter with such classics like Bein' Green and Sing among that show's highlights. Once again, such human celebrities like Diana Rigg and Charles Grodin add their own touches to the proceedings not to mention cameos by such luminaries like Peter Falk, Robert Morley, Peter Ustinov, and especially John Clesse their own sense of humor. There's another Muppet cameo here that I don't feel like revealing that I was amused by but I'll just now say that The Great Muppet Caper is highly recommend by me.

Much of this is because I wanted to see Muppets--not Charles Grodin, Diana Rigg and other human actors as well as some uninteresting plot about jewel thieves. And, because the Muppets are best when not over-burdened with plot and are allowed to just cut up and be silly, the more there was plot the more the film lost my attention.

This is a fun movie, plain and simple, which parents won't find too bad either.

There's plenty of great gags, horribly awesome puns, the cool flavor of the 'Jewel of the North Atlantic', and a few cameos (John Cleese and Peter Ustinov notably) surrounded by the nut-house that is the muppet world make this a near must see.

The second Muppets feature film (and the only one directed by Jim Henson) starts out strong but, as other reviewers before me have pointed out, it doesn't sustain. Part of the problem is too much focus on the jewel thief plot and an especially annoying Charles Grodin. The Muppets are lots of fun here but there's only so much they can do when competing against a ham actor desperately trying to steal a movie about Muppets away from the Muppets. It's not called The Great Grodin Caper, after all. Anyway, the jewel thief plot is dullsville and the movie should not have spent so much time on it, in my opinion. A significant part of the film drags because of this. I appreciate the attempt to pay tribute to movies of the 1930s and 40s but a little goes a long way.Still, there are some funny moments. Fozzie adding sugar to champagne to make it taste like ginger ale is probably my favorite scene from the movie and it's what many would consider a minor gag. Some of the best jokes are the ones that break the fourth wall, like that clever opening with Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo in a hot air balloon commenting on the opening credits, Diana Rigg pointing out her expository dialogue, Miss Piggy complaining about doing her own stunts, and Kermit chastising Miss Piggy for overacting. The celebrity cameos this time include John Cleese, Robert Morley, Peter Ustinov, and Peter Falk. The Cleese and Falk scenes are the funniest. The songs are cute but not as memorable as the ones from The Muppet Movie. Most die-hard Muppets fans will probably love this despite its flaws. I liked it but didn't love it.

When The Muppet Movie VHS release was advertised, the second Muppet film, The Great Muppet Caper (1981), was trumpeted along with it. That set the bar high, and unfortunately, it didn't click with me well as a child.You might attribute that to drab scenery (the newspaper office and the Happiness Hotel) and costumes (Kermit and Fozzie are none too appealing in this), and themes of newspaper writing and jewel thievery that aren't going to attract every child. Having rewatched The Great Muppet Caper now, I've come around on it, or at least the first half. The film starts strong with numerous funny gags, but runs out of steam. We have some humorous self-references and Gonzo being reckless, and then as we get into the film we have dubious claims Kermit and Fozzie are identical twins, and much fun over how bad the Happiness Hotel is. The British couple who barely register Miss Piggy climbing their walls are a riot. After that, particularly when Miss Piggy begins her dancing and modelling scenes, the film begins to drag and the story isn't all that strong.

I was within my last few years before adolescence at the time, and may have liked both movies equally when I first saw them. I've watched both of them again twice in recent years, and don't recall ever having an opinion on which one was better before those viewings. I now think the first one, from 1979, is the stronger of the two (I think most Muppets fans would agree), but this 1981 follow-up is still an impressive family movie.Kermit and Fozzie are reporters for the Daily Chronicle, and Gonzo is their photographer. One day, they are out on the street trying to get a good news story, when jewels are stolen from English fashion designer Lady Holiday! This happens when they aren't looking, so they don't notice, and instead write an article on Kermit and Fozzie as twins joining the newspaper staff, which they are fired for. The three of them then travel to London, England in the cargo hold of a plane to interview Lady Holiday. They stay at Happiness Hotel, a decaying building with free accommodation! When Kermit goes to meet Lady Holiday in her office, she isn't there, but he meets her new receptionist, Miss Piggy, instead. Trying to impress him, Miss Piggy lies and says she is Lady Holiday, and they quickly fall in love. However, she obviously can't keep her secret for long, and the jewel thieves are trying to frame her! If you ask me, the main thing that makes The Great Muppet Caper inferior to its predecessor is the set of songs. None of the songs can match Rainbow Connection and certain other memorable ones from The Muppet Movie, and two of the songs here, The First Time It Happens and Miss Piggy's Fantasy, make for two fairly lacklustre and tedious sequences. This second Muppet movie also doesn't have the same poignancy and meaningfulness as the first one. However, there's still a lot to like. The songs generally aren't bad, and of course, there are the same lovable Muppets in the movie. They also didn't forget about the humour, as the film definitely is funny, even if it's not usually hilarious. There are celebrity cameos here (though not as many as there are in The Muppet Movie), including one from John Cleese, of Monty Python fame. He helps make the part where Miss Piggy sneaks into 17 Highbrow Street a comic highlight. The plot also works well for a lighthearted family movie like this.Jim Henson's Muppets made an excellent silver screen debut in 1979, in a film that's still widely admired after just over thirty years. I guess it's no surprise that this 1981 follow-up is inferior, since that's often the case with franchise movies. However, overall, The Great Muppet Caper is a very good family comedy adventure, and is still much better than Muppets from Space, the last theatrical movie featuring the famous puppet characters, released in 1999. I saw that one for the first time over a year ago and had never been so disappointed by anything featuring the Muppets! Anyway, kids could really enjoy this second installment in the franchise, and as usual with these films, it's not just for them. There's enough to make it worth watching for adults who still like the Muppets as well. Just because it's not as good as its predecessor doesn't mean it's not another noteworthy accomplishment.

The culprit turns out to be her own obnoxious brother Charles Grodin and his trio of burglar-models; Grodin seems to have the hots for Miss Piggy (at one point singing his heart out to her but she puts down his effort by revealing that the actor's voice was dubbed!), a model wannabe engaged as Rigg's secretary and who ends up impersonating her boss to impress Kermit. The change in locale adds precious little to the table and, truth be told, the film tends to sag badly during its midsection (with too many schmaltzy songs for balance). However, when the film is funny, it's frequently hilarious the in-jokey commentary by the trio of reporters accompanying the opening credits; their traveling to London in a plane's luggage compartment inside boxes denoting their species (Gonzo is a Whatever) and their being thrown off the plane in mid-flight eventually landing at Robert Morley's feet; the eccentric and inquisitive guests at the Happiness Hotel; Miss Piggy's central musical number is an amusing pastiche of old Esther Williams aquatic routines; Miss Piggy's run-in with lorry driver Peter Ustinov (who complains, after being thrown into the garbage, that his is only a cameo), etc. Ex-Monty Python John Cleese also appears as a henpecked husband who thinks nothing of glimpsing a pig climbing the walls of his apartment building.

There are some good songs and a few not bad songs, but overall the music is a joy to listen to.Special Effects There are very few special effects in this film, and with the movie being created in the early '80s.

All of the Muppet stuff in the years before Jim Henson died and when I was still a kid. The great Muppet caper was wonderful starting with them being thrown out of their plane in their stow away boxes and landing in a pond, their ckecking into the happiness hotel and the song that went with it, miss piggy meeting Lady Holiday and her witty conversation with her. It almost has the combination of old time charm and typical Muppet humor combined. A lot of the movie has that. I really liked the Esther Williams style water ballet with miss piggy, even when I was a kid and I didn't know then what was being satired. In recent times when I've really started loving old time golden age Hollywood musicals with golden age stars like Judy Garland, June Allyson, Esther Williams, etc., that has caused me to really love the Esther Williams water ballet scene in the Muppet caper, especially when it turned out to be miss piggy's dream and then she in reality dives into a small fountain, being the only one who gets wet. Another great scene is when all of the muppets are riding their bikes through the park singing. It sort of, in a way reminds me of a time when I was about 8 years old walking through Hyde park in London with my family when I was on vacation in England. That scene, for that reason added, makes the Muppet bike riding scene and song even more terrific. There's also lots of humorous wit through the movie, especially from Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, and of course Miss piggy. And a number of great cameos from John Cleese, Charles Groden, and from the great Muppet man himself, Jim Henson in a restaurant. And the guard, while Scooter delivers a pizza, but I hate pepperoni. Funny. Some reviewers have commented on the diamond plot not being good. The diamond plot is only a small part of the movie to me. The bigger picture, all of the things I've written above, is what makes this movie great. And of course, don't miss the cameo from Oscar the grouch.

This time, the muppets get involved with an attempted jewel heist involving Miss Piggy's sophisticated boss (the gorgeous Diana Rigg) and her neer-do-well brother (the very American Charles Grodin, apparently content in villain roles after Heaven Can Wait), and romance erupts once again between frog and hog. It isn't a sequel to The Muppet Movie, but is still equally as entertaining, filled with some delicious sight gags including the turning of Miss Piggy into an Ann Miller type tap dancer.Certainly more elaborate looking, it is a throwback to the type of 30's musicals that starred Fred and Ginger, and Miss Piggy's big production number (The First Time You See Her) is truly a marvel to look at. In fact, it came out the same year as another throwback to the old 30's musicals (Pennies From Heaven) even though it isn't nearly as dark. The few cameos that do occur are by British theater legends Robert Morley and Peter Ustinov, as well as Monty Python favorite John Cleese.Follow-ups to successful films are rarely worthy of their predecessors, but in the case of this one, the second time around really was worth while. They would have one more entry (the entertaining but seemingly desperate The Muppets Take Manhattan) and a long break before coming back (the pathetic Follow that Bird! not counting) to entertain a new generation that had not had the privilege of being around when they first got their start on T.V. variety shows and finally their own shows and movies.

Granted, I think The Muppets Take Manhattan and the 2011 reboot are near masterpieces, but I've found myself relatively bored with the rest of the Muppet films. The Great Muppet Caper is a bit of a mixed bag for me. While the last 40 minutes or so is essentially devoid of any sort of laughter or entertainment, there are some parts in the first hour that are very funny. And yet the laughs were few, and while there were plenty of smiles, even a hesitant recommendation may not be hesitant enough.The weirdly complicated plot involves Kermit, Fozzy, and Gonzo placed in charge of investigating a jewelry robbery (as they are newspaper reporters). The jewelry was stolen from Lady Holiday, whom Kermit wishes to interview, though due to an unfortunate mix-up, Kermit mistakes Miss Piggy for Lady Holiday, leading up to several complications. In addition, another jewelry thief takes place, and Miss Piggy is framed! There's more to the plot than that, but most other details are unnecessary. And that's one of the problems with this film; unnecessary detail. The movie is way too busy. Nicky Holiday (Lady Holiday's brother) develops feelings for Miss Piggy, but this adds absolutely nothing to the story. Many other plot threads like this are in this film, and many of them should've been cut.I've already mentioned that the last 40 minutes are dull, and believe me; they are an absolute snooze fest. And they're also completely nonsensical. The convoluted plot suddenly takes a sharp tune from the mildly serious, to an anything goes kind of finish. It's not particularly satisfying if you had to ask.And then we have the breaking of the fourth wall which happens far too much. Personally, I find it funny when a film breaks the fourth wall, but this is a kind of humor that's much better in moderation. The fact that the fourth wall is broken over half a dozen times before the opening credits are over should tell you something about the over-use of this kind of humor.And yet, despite these flaws, there are times when The Great Muppet Caper is pretty fun. John Cleese and Joan Sanderson have arguably the funniest scene in the film portraying a British elderly couple at breakfast having a deliciously droll and satirical conversation that's nearly impossible not to smile during. Jack Warden also gets a funny cameo as a newspaper editor, as does Robert Morley as a British Gentlemen.Of course, there are a number of memorable lines as well, and the technical aspect of many scenes is quite astounding.The musical numbers are certainly a mixed bag. Hey, a Movie, is forgettable and the on screen events are chaotic and cluttered. Happiness Hotel is an extremely clever and upbeat song, and one of the best songs in the film (it's also very well choreographed). The First Time it Happens is the standout of the film, with catchy lyrics, and great choreography. And lastly, Couldn't We Ride is immensely dull, despite some nifty on screen special effects.Charles Grodin as Nicky Holiday is forgettable, but then again, so is the character. Diana Rigg gets some great lines as Lady Holiday, and is easily the standout of the (admittedly small) human cast.The score, composed by Joe Raposo, is a simple parody score. Like most of the Muppet scores, the music works fine for the film, but it's not likely to hold up well when taken away from it.Falling squarely in the middle of the Muppet films, The Great Muppet Caper has some amusing scenes, but dull stretches, a convoluted plot, and fourth wall joke overkill, stops it from achieving a higher rating. Still, I came away from the film humming one or two of the songs, and recalling some funny cameos, so I suppose The Great Muppet Caper succeeds to at least some extent.

There was nothing wrong with it; it had Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and pretty much any pop culture reference that you could think of at the time. It was smarter than the kids that were watching it, and for my money, still holds up pretty well. The Muppet movies didn't really come around for me the first time around, in fact I remember watching most of them on VHS when my dad recorded them for me. Think about it, The Muppet Movie was released in 1979, and to say the least I was the last thing my parents had on their mind at the time. However, when I was old enough to know how to operate the VCR and go through the stacks of VHS recordings that we had in our house, it was that fateful day I popped in 1981's The Great Muppet Caper starring all of your favorite Muppets; from Kermit the Frog to *John Cleese, yes, John Motherf*ckin' Cleese is in this movie.Like most Muppet fare the plot is going to include plenty of hijinks, celebrity cameos, and humor that goes well over the intended audiences heads, including one in Caper that refers to a guy cheating on his wife. Jim Henson had some balls on him. Any who, we open Caper with our three heroes, Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo in a hot air balloon talking about the opening credits. Next thing they know their balloon is going down right in the middle of a crowded street which breaks out into our first musical number. Further hijinks ensue that involve a case of mistaken identity, stolen diamonds, and a love triangle between a frog, pig, and Charles Grodin. Good clean family fun.What stands out, like most Muppets movies, are the songs. The highlight is Happiness Hotel that has the sound of a blues, zydeco, and a big band mash-up that works perfectly and will be stuck in your head for days. Some of the other songs get a little sappy, but there's still a whimsical element to the music that can appeal to the young and old alike.While the setting of the movie takes place in London, it could really take place anywhere. This isn't The Muppets Take Manhattan where the city is almost as big a star as The Muppets, but you still get a chuckle from some of the dry British humor we all know and love.If you've only seen 2011's The Muppets with Jason Segel and Amy Adams, which is fine in it's own way, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to The Great Muppet Caper that has plenty of mad-cap antics and no cheap Disney tie-in's.*Disclaimer Of course I know John Cleese isn't a Muppet, but he might be the king of silly walks.Check out other reviews at simplisticreviews.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"A Movie That I Have Been Waiting To Watch For A Very Long Time!","Date":"29 July 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family","Review":" The Great Muppet Caper has been a film which I have been waiting to watch for many, many years!

Everything the pink one does is memorable--her exuberance at landing a job as receptionist to fashion icon Lady Holiday (I'll TAKE IT! I'LL TAKE IT!...I'll sit, I can sit, I'm very good at sitting.), her scaling a building in evening gown and heels (Next time they want stunts, they get a double), her tap dance (in glass slippers!) her dismissal of the boobish Charles Grodin (You can't even sing! Your voice was dubbed!) her honest hurt when Kermit breaks character to accuse her of hamming it up (I am TRYING to save this movie!), and, of course, that climactic motorbike ride. Let film critics talk of Fellini and Antonioni; my never-to-be-topped moment of cinematic nirvana consists of Piggy, clad in white, crashing a motorcycle through a stained-glass window. Diana Rigg, as Lady Holiday, is a perfect foil; she suggests a human Piggy slimmed down and gone cynical. (She tosses off a long, irrelevant monologue, shrugging, It's plot exposition. It has to go somewhere.) Grodin, recruited as Kermit's rival for the pig's affections, doesn't blink once at the assignment. There are numerous featured bits for the other characters, human and Muppet; John Cleese and Joan Sanderson are married (of course) and more reclusive and upper-class British than anyone in any season of Masterpiece Theatre. Fozzie gets more good-natured sidekick lines than usual (toying with a glass of champagne, he remarks, You put enough sugar in this stuff, it tastes just like ginger ale--it doesn't, I tried), and the Dr. Teeth band also gets their due in the Happiness Hotel production number. All this movie wants to do is make you happy--and if that's corny, go back to your Clint Eastwood movie essays in gloom and leave me alone.

As a kid, you take things for granted like the amazing puppet work in this movie, the set design, the great script. All you see if you're a kid watching this movie is a bunch of colorful characters involved in a light-hearted crime drama.But from the perspective of an adult, you appreciate everything in this movie. You appreciate the wacky humor which constantly breaks the fourth wall(even in the emotional scenes), and all the cameos from some terrific actors. You've got John Cleese, Peter Ustinov, Jack Warden, and even Peter Falk! Even though these are just cameos, this film has some terrific star power and actually appreciates those great actors that don't get nearly the appreciation they do today.This movie is seriously, seriously funny. The muppets are all wonderfully realized characters who actually all serve a dramatic purpose in the framework of the film, and they interact beautifully with the main stars of the film, Charles Grodin and Diana Rigg.Charles Grodin is excellent as this thief named Nicky who really steals the show with his fantastic overacting, which actually works to this movie's advantage and serves to make it even funnier.But seriously, if you've never seen The Great Muppet Caper before, you're missing out. The Muppets crack wise and tell great jokes in practically every scene and this film will leave you satisfied with a big smile on your face. This is actually the perfect family film. It's not too sappy, and even when you think it's going to get to that point, it goes in the opposite direction. "},{"Title":"Amusing big-screen venture for the Muppets.

This sequel sticks to a similar formula and is a perfectly acceptable comic vehicle. You've got the slapstick humour and cuteness/cuddliness of the Muppets to keep the kids happy. Meanwhile the grown-ups can enjoy the subtle asides and the amusing cameo appearances from the likes of Peter Ustinov, John Cleese, Peter Falk and Jack Warden.A trio of unlikely and inept reporters &#150; Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear and Gonzo &#150; miss a scandalous jewel heist even though it happens practically right in front of them. Their boss (Jack Warden) threatens to fire them, giving the hapless threesome one last chance&#133;. they must go to London and help the victim, rich fashion designer Lady Holliday (Diana Rigg), recover her stolen gems. Matters become complicated when Kermit mistakenly believes a ditsy secretary, Miss Piggy, to be the real Lady Holliday. Meanwhile, Lady Holliday lives in perpetual fear that her newest diamond necklace might be the next target for the cunning thief. Little does she realize the guilty one is, in fact, her own brother Nicky (Charles Grodin). Nicky cleverly frames Miss Piggy for the crimes and, while she is locked away and the police think the danger has past, he plans his final, most audacious heist &#150; a priceless gemstone stored in the high security Mallory Gallery&#133;..The Great Muppet Caper is a convivial, attractive film with much to like. There are continual running jokes about English eccentricity and numerous touches of clever wordplay. The Muppets are amusingly voiced (as always) and most of the live actors seem to be enjoying themselves. Rigg is particularly good as the vulnerable but hard-nosed Lady Holliday. Grodin is the only one who seems a bit out of place, chewing the scenery rather too hammily from beneath excessive make-up. All the guest cameos are played very funnily. The film starts and ends particularly well, with lively set pieces full of good-natured hijinks, songs and manic mayhem. Unfortunately the middle of the film seems rather long-winded, with tedious scenes which don't really move the story forward. It doesn't entirely ruin the film but lowers the overall likability a notch or two.

The Muppets are great as usual, Jim Henson especially as Kermit. It was such a shame that he died, he was such a talented man, though Steve Whitmire is a very good replacement in the later Muppet films. Great to see Sam the Eagle, Fozzie, Wrolf and Rizzo. Out of the human cast, Charles Grodin and Diana Rigg are very good, Grodin with his charm and Rigg with her frostiness, though if anything I wish the two stars had more screen time. Not to mention the amusing cameos from John Cleese and Peter Ustinov. The songs were very pleasant, perhaps not as memorable as ones in other Muppet films but First Time It Happens is one of my all time favourite Muppet songs, and there are some clever jokes about British eccentricity and what have you. My favourite Muppet and the the best aspect of the film, or for me anyway, was the always wonderful Miss Piggy, who delighted in every scene she was in.

Every other newspaper's cover story is on it. But the cover story for Kermit and Fozzie's paper was Twin Brothers Become Reporters. Their boss was not pleased. They lost their jobs. But Kermit wanted to go to England to interview Lady Holiday. Unfortunately, they fly in cargo and are thrown from the plane. When they arrive in Great Britain, they check into the Happiness Hotel, which was a run-down dump run by the weirdest characters around! There's no kitchen, no food, no hope.         Miss Piggy becomes Lady Holiday's secretary and was told to watch the office while she went to a luncheon. That's when Kermit the Frog walked in and took her to be Lady Holiday. They set up a dinner date, which Fozzie blabbed to everyone at the hotel. Fozzie wanted to go along on the date, but Kermit said it wasn't a good idea. When he finally allows him to come, Fozzie figured it meant everyone from the hotel could come. They all go to a very fancy restaurant for dinner. Gonzo helps them pay the tab by taking photographs of other people and charging $10; That night, Lady Holiday's jewels were stolen again and Gonzo was able to snap a photo of the guy right when it happened! All they had to do was develop the picture and the case was solved! That plan backfired when the door to the dark room was opened.        Kermit finds out that Miss Piggy was not in fact Lady Holiday, and if that wasn't enough, Lady Holiday's brother Nicky, the jewel thief planted the stolen necklace on Miss Piggy and she was arrested. Gonzo overheard Nicky planning out the next heist Lady Holiday's baseball diamond. So Kermit and pals devise a plan to catch those thieves redhanded, no matter what color their hands currently were. Miss Piggy breaks out of jail and snatches a truck from Peter Ustinov who has a run-in with Oscar the Grouch.             At the Mallory Gallery, the friends get in and stop the thieves. The police arrive and take the guilty parties to jail. The good guys all fly home the same way they got to England--they're thrown out of the plane.                This was as good as The Muppet Movie. Watch for cameo appearences by the Muppet performers! Richard Hunt is a cab driver in the beginning, Frank Oz is the man behind Gonzo when he says Stop the presses, Jim Henson is the guy who get's his picture taken in the restaurant, and Jerry Nelson is the guy in the park who informs his real-life daughter that bears wear hats.

Any joke these guys could possibly make shows up here, and they all work perfectly! This is the one of the best Muppet movies and comedy films you'll ever see!Synopsis Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo work for their local newspaper, The Daily Chronicle. After a huge robbery featuring the famous Lady Holiday takes place - literally right behind their backs! - they decide to go to England to interview Lady Holiday. Before they can see her, though, Miss Piggy comes in attempts to be a model, but becomes a receptionist instead. Kermit confuses Piggy for Lady Holiday, and they go out to dinner. What they don't know is that they'll be investigating who Lady Holiday's robbers are.There are way too many jokes for me to talk about here! They all work, and they're all funny! One of the great things the Muppets do well is break the fourth wall, and let us into their world. The fourth wall jokes are awesome! One of my favorites is after a huge musical number that takes place in Piggy's mind during Lady Holiday's fashion show. In her vision, Mickey, Lady Holiday's brother, and Kermit both sing to her. After her vision, she realizes Mickey framed her for something she didn't do. As she's being taken away she yells at him, Y'know what? You can't even sing! Your voice was dubbed! At the beginning of the movie, our reporters miss the big robbery story and tell the boss they'll do better next time. He asks them why they think there'll be a next time, and Kermit replies, If there's not, it's gonna be a real short movie.The fourth wall jokes are great, but the other jokes work just as well, too! I LOVE the Happiness Hotel! After they get there, they have this exchange of dialoguePOPS Hey, how are you boys fixin' to pay? KERMIT What're our choices? POPS A Credit Card; B Cash; C Sneak out in the middle of the night. FOZZIE? We'll take C. POPS Very popular choice.CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? Why would that be an option in a hotel? It's so funny! Another favorite joke of mine is when the reporters are trying to get a taxi. None of them stop for Kermit, and Gonzo takes care of it in his own weirdo fashion. He jumps in the middle of the street screaming TAXIIII! A taxi stops, Kermit acknowledges the effectiveness of that action, and Gonzo replies, Yeah, it's great when it works. YOU CAN'T FIND JOKES LIKE THESE ANYWHERE ELSE!!!The songs are really good, too. Joe Raposo, one of the early songwriters of Sesame Street, wrote these songs. These songs have a bit more of a purpose than the songs in The Muppet Show. They set the mood and the tone of the film. They're also really memorable and fun. They're no Rainbow Connection, but they're still pretty good.What I love about this movie is that the humor is very smart. Just like in many Muppet project or in any Jim Henson project, the entertainment is smart and thoughtful. The writers and producers put thought behind these jokes. It's not random crap thrown in front of us, insulting our intelligence. These jokes work because people thought about them and put on the screen what they knew would work.I just can't say how much I love this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! It's hilarious, it's musical, it's mysterious, and it's our favorite characters doing what we love! I promise you will love this movie! You'll get a headache laughing throughout this film! BOOYIKA!

The Great Muppet Caper looks a slightly similar topic. At the beginning of the movie, Kermit and Fozzie are reporters and run a story about how they have just joined the staff of the Daily Chronicle. As it so happens, a robbery was taking place right behind the two of them and neither one noticed. Doesn't it seem common for a lot of people in the news to go to great lengths to promote themselves while missing the most obvious problems in the world? OK, so that was a very loose connection. I make a lot of loose connections. That's just how I am. Anyway, Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo do the conscientious thing and set out to solve the case. With a lot of funny stuff going on, I might add. As with The Muppet Movie, there are a lot of jokes, songs and cameos (including Jim Henson as a man in a restaurant). This one isn't quite as good as the first one, but still really enjoyable. Probably my favorite scene is John Cleese and Joan Sanderson as a pair of archetypal stuffy English people. Diana Rigg's robbery victim seems like a precursor to Meryl Streep's character in The Devil Wears Prada.Anyway, really fun.

Technically, he took puppetry into a whole different level. A 'creature workshop' was created, and along with other great performers and skilled artists, which developed some amazing effects for such astonishingly elaborate films as The Dark Crystal (1982) and Labyrinth (1986). The workshop is still, to this day, a fully functioning company, that recently worked on Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are (2009). Aside from Henson's more forward thinking for the development of his craft, he has endowed the collective consciousness with a collection of enduring, lovable characters. Jim Henson had been developing a puppetry style for television since the 1950's. However, after the success of the Children's Television Workshop's Sesame Street (1969 - present), he wanted to be able to take creative control over a show featuring his Muppet puppets.The cultural phenomenon that was The Muppet Show, began in 1976 and ran until 1981. The show was set in a theatre, which was harking back to the days of vaudeville. This element of variety was carried over into the first film, The Muppet Movie (1979), and has also been developed in their second feature, The Great Muppet Caper. Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear are twin brothers who, along with Gonzo, are playing investigative journalists. After being fired from their newspaper, they decide to pursue a story about jewel thieves in England. There they meet a whole host of other Muppet characters, and become embroiled in a mystery involving brother and sister, Nicky and Lady Holiday (Charles Grodin and Diana Rigg). There are some catchy musical numbers, and a Busby Berkley inspired synchronised swimming sequence with Miss Piggy and its centre.It is testament to the characters that Henson created here. They still endure today. I have many fond memories of the Muppets. This was unfortunately the last great Muppet film. (Here's hoping that this years The Muppets will reinvigorate the franchise.) Caper is a fun film. The characters constantly refer to themselves being in a film (this is a device that Henson used also in The Muppet Movie).

There are many cool effects such as the Muppets riding bicycles and the Muppets in a double-decker bus, with Pops driving and Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem performing on the top deck of the bus. The movie also has a neat opening sequence with Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo in a hot air balloon, and an even neater ending sequence with the Muppets wearing parachutes.Let's not also forget about the human cast.

High camp ensues in Jolly Old England as aspiring model Miss Piggy shanghais fashion designer Lady Holiday (Diane Rigg) into hiring her, only to be framed by Lady Holiday's slimy, garishly-besocked brother Nicky (Charles Grodin) and a trio of disco-dressed evil models for stealing the Lady's jewels.  It's up to bumbling twin reporters Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear, along with all the other Muppets, to prove her innocence and prevent the theft of Lady Holiday's prize possession - the Fabulous Baseball Diamond!Corny blurbs aside, the movie is hilarious, with tons of slapstick, camp, and celebrity cameos.  Yes, it's a musical, but the songs advance the plot and are genuinely funny.  Miss Piggy shines in a juicy role, playing a star-struck aspiring model (though she apparently only knows one pose) who gets a big break (and a fun water-ballet extravaganza) only to be thrown in jail (right out of a women's prison movie), finally escaping to help the gang overcome the bad guys.  One fabulously funny bit happens when, wanting to impress Kermit on their first date, Piggy makes Kermit guess her address - on some Highbrow St.  They make a date to meet there - the address just happens to exist in a ritzy way, occupied by John Cleese as a true Upper-Class Twit.  Piggy breaks and enters, and through sheer force of will makes Cleese pretend to be her butler.In short, the movie is sassy and witty and fun, perfect fare for both children and adults.  I said that earlier, didn't I?  Well, watch it, please.

It is the scene where we see both the Charles Grodin gang and the Muppets, getting ready to go to the museum. The Grodin Gang wants to steal the great Baseball Diamond and The Muppets want to stop them from doing so .While the  Grodin Gang reads off its checklist to see if the tools they need for their heist was appropriated so do The Muppets. While the Grodin Gang is well prepared,The Muppets are trying their best to keep up with the bad guys. An un-exact sampling follows-Grodin Gang-Night vision binoculars....check.One hundred foot long rope...check.The Muppets-Flashlight....I think we got one in the bus.Just thinking about this scene makes me jump up and laugh!

I love the way the Muppets always act sill y- especially when Kermit and Fozzie say they're identical twins, that's hilarious.  This kind of humor is very specific, you have to be in the right kind of mood for it, and some of it, of course, is juvenile, other parts are over the kids' heads.  But the best of the Muppet movies, in my opinion!

Wonderful entertainment for the whole family with Fozzie, Gonzo and of course...Animal on hand.

I thought I had liked it. Recently I picked up a copy of the Great Muppet Caper because I was curious to see what I had enjoyed about it. Also, because I remember the man who played the brother was my first object of sexual attraction. After viewing the film once more I was disappointed at best; the musical numbers were basically crap as was the script. I realize that this is a children's film but still make a little effort.There were a few good sequences which I did enjoy but other than that it wasn't a good film. So it gets 3 out of 10 stars, though I might be biased due to ruining a good memory.

Everything goes for flat-out laughs here as the comedy comes in every direction and naturally there are cameos abound. Some of the jokes come shining through, while others just seem more dumb than clever. Perfect for all audiences, but not one of the better productions of the cinematic genre. 2.5 out of 5 stars.  "}]
