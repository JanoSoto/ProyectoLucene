There are strong anti-Japanese messeges (including one Japanese guy having a tash similar to a certain German dictator) in the film but it has been over 33 years since the film was made and so this can be put down to it being dated. Ultimately it is a film about injustice and Revenge. The Bushido School's general evilness, the injustice against the Chinese in Shanghai and Bruce's (called Chen in this one) hot headedness create a circle of violence which escalates completely out of control. This is an intensely gritty Kung Fu film unlike Bruce's later films which were more escapist in nature and Fist Of Fury has the highest body count in terms of Bruce actually killing people with those fists. The legendary 'Sick Man Of Asia' scene is amazing and the end of Kill Bill clearly homage's this so any Tarentino fan's will get an added joy out of watching this beautiful sequence.

That aside, essentially this is a riotous Bruce Lee vehicle, kicking out trademarks and smashing up all evil in the process. The plot (Lee's sifu poisoned by Japanese school in turn-of-the-century Shanghai) is a valid excuse to string a great line-up of fight sequences together, and what great action this is Bruce pounds the lights out of a dojo full of evil Japs using only fists, feet and nunchakus, and the duel with Baker (Lee's real-life personal bodyguard) near the movie's end is sheer entertainment typified. Though based on factual events, the subject matter is vastly exaggerated. Nevertheless, as kung fu theatre goes, Fist of Fury is an immensely satisfying experience, and stands as probably Lee's best Hong Kong work.

Here, we have the 'student sets out to avenge his master's death' which was already the major storyline of most martial arts films. However, it is handled in a more realistic way then usual and technically it is far superior. Lee was allowed to choreograph his own fights and his battle with Japanese martial artists in their school and climactic duels with a Russian boxer and a Japanese swordsman remains classic fight scenes.The film drags somewhat in the middle although the lengthy dialogue scene between Lee and his girlfriend was another step forward for the Hong Kong martial arts movie, vivid proof that Lee was a pretty good ACTOR. By contrast, Lee's final farewell to his girlfriend is all the more powerful for being done completely without dialogue at all. The ending is the most powerful and moving of all the Lee films, the final freeze frame managing to encapsulate Lee's grace and power in a single shot.Many mock Lee's films as being silly and just consisting of fighting. Both accusations are completely untrue. They have far less fights than most films of this kind and, at least in the three Hong Kong films he made, there is a clear message that violence does not solve anything. They may not have the polish of the more recent works of Jackie Chan and Jet Lee but their power remains undiminished, as long as of course one does not watch the awful dubbed versions!

Fist of Fury tells the story of Chen (Lee) who arrives in Shanghai to his martial art school, only to learn that his beloved teacher has died and the funeral is going on when he arrives. Soon it is revealed that the death was without a doubt a murder and our fierce hero is going to solve the mystery..With the power of his fists and kicks.This film is prehaps little too racist towards Japanese since they are depicted as dirty and greedy criminals here and some lines in the script are very underlining and judge the Japanese people too much. Then again, the film makes me wonder about racism in general since there is so much mayhem in the film and so many Chinese and Japanese get killed by each other, so maybe this film was not meant to be racist at all. Maybe the intention was to tell something about us who cannot live in peace with each other. All these things happen even today, 30 years after the film's release so the subject matter is definitely universal as it was back then in 1972. Still I would have toned down some of the dialogue bits since they are little too strong, and I think Bruce Lee himself didn't like the film's racial elements.On the other hand, this film is really beautiful as it depicts the sensitive love between Bruce and Nora Miao, who is very beautiful and sweet female in this film, and also in other Lee's films. The scene at the teacher's grave is one of the most sensitive scenes of love I've ever seen, and those two characters are hand touchingly full of emotion. The themes in this film are mainly about relationships between individuals and humans in general, so the film has many things to offer moreover mere action. This is action classic with heart.The film is famous for its legendary first nunchaku fight scene at the Japanese' training camp as Bruce shows for the first time his personal fighting tool and weapon, a pair of nunchakus. That fight scene even before nunchakus is among the greatest ever filmed since the choreography and timing is totally marvellous as the one take lasts very long without edits, and Bruce kicks and hits about ten victims during that, and the timing and stunt men had to be really sharp in order to not to get hurt for real. Also, the nunchaku fights in the film are incredible as Bruce uses his weapon without flinching an eye and with fierce look on his face. This all is even more powerful in his next film, Way of the Dragon.The film was shot mostly in studio and there are only few exteriors in Fist of Fury. The staging is very convincing and the film's bigger budget compared to that of The Big Boss' really shows. The last fight in night time at the Japanese yard is very beautifully lighted and full of cinematic magic. The film is full of details and elements from Chinese culture and traditions, so this is little more personal and interesting film than The Big Boss, which had some irritating little flaws like the sound of Bruce' necklace he got from his mother and the scene where Bruce punches a guy through a wall with funny and campy result, which director Lo definitely didn't meant to look that funny. Fist of Fury is a stunning piece of Hong Kong and world cinema and easily among Lee's greatest films. The atmosphere is created so convincingly that even people who usually don't appreciate action films should appreciate this, since this film is many more things than just action and fighting. Fist of Fury hasn't lost any of its power and punch during these 30 years and will remain one of the most important martial arts movies ever made. 9/10 "},{"Title":"underrated here but i think i know why...","Date":"11 October 2002","Score":"18 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Romance","Review":" ...most of you have seen the dubbed, cutted version. this review is for the uncut version.bruce lee makes his most memorable performance in this excellent martial art film. the main character is not the perfect kind forgiving guy you always see in these types of movies. he cannot forgive all he can think of is revenge. he's even prepared to kick down some innocent people on the side if need be to achieve his goal.martial art movies often suffer from the same problems as porn movies do. the lack of a decent plot.in this one bad guys are really bad guys, the good guy is like 'the punisher', shows anger in every turn but is unable to show his emotions towards his girlfriend. here even the ending is an unconventional one.a very good film, compared to the remake with jet li bruce lee's movie loses in great fighting scenes, but wins in attitude and depth. jet li wasn't very believable as chen zhen, but you can see the fire burning in bruce's eyes in every single screen.

Constantly referring to the Chinese (as a whole) as the 'sick men of Asia,' and even thinking them lower than dogs (as is shown in some of the scenes). The entire basis of this Kung Fu film becomes a real reaction to the pain of discrimination and the hatred of a sense of racism that the Japanese dished out to the Chinese, and is based actually off of a real story that followed similar tones. What makes this film very special is the commitment that Bruce Lee has to defeating the Japanese whose goal is to crush the will of the Chinese -- a very accurate reflection of the sentiment that existed.Overall, this is a very good film that was well done; it has a lot of the defects that films similar to its' genre have (having the grainy feel of Kung Fu films of its' time) but other than the typical, it really sets a standard for Kung Fu and film in general. One can see it, in many ways, as being a good basis for subsequent action and Kung Fu films. A lot of the things in this film were very original and very interesting -- overall, a must see film for anybody who enjoys Action, Kung Fu, or 'political resistance' so to speak. A film for the downtrodden striking back.

Well paced, with creative and fairly realistic fight scenes distributed evenly, the movie keeps the audience's attention all the way through the long fight scene near the climactic end (I won't spoil the actual ending for you).        The predictable revenge plot provides the emotional trigger to release Lee's rage-filled fights and his now-famous smashing of the No Dogs or Chinese Allowed sign.  Equally famous is his this time you eat paper, next time you eat glass line.  Viewers are also treated to the only on-screen kiss by Lee, some comical moments with Lee playing a bumbling telephone repairman, a cameo by director Lo-Wei as the chief inspector, and a soundtrack which effectively builds tension in the fight scenes.  You won't recognize Jackie Chan as the stuntman for one of the Japanese martial artists who flies through the screen door.        The most memorable part of this movie is Lee's dynamic vitality as he goes about his business, cocksure and confident, and with the goods to back it up.  I am forever grateful to those who, in marketing this movie to the west, decided to dub only the dialogue and to leave Lee's original fight sounds untouched.  As is evident in the US version of Return of the Dragon (aka Way of the Dragon), dubbing Lee's fight sounds is nothing short of a sin.

I really did.Well, that is - I liked the wild, over-the-top fight scenes that were, at times, a literal frenzied roller-coaster ride of grunting, groaning, snapping, leaping, screaming bodies flying this way and that.Yep. Bruce Lee (with his perfect coordination and his precision timing) really did a mighty fine job of royally kicking some serious ass.And, in the lull between all of the Kung Fu action, I also liked the priceless Geisha-Girl striptease. (nudge-nudge-wink-wink) Now, that was a hoot-and-a-half! And, I also got a really big kick (pardon the pun) at the moment when Bruce Lee's character who (not being able to put his opponent down with any of his deadly kicks or chops) actually resorted to (get this!) sinking his teeth into this fierce, unstoppable brute's foot. (I ain't kidding!) Believe me, from where I was sitting, this was a sheer delight to watch. This sort of conduct from Bruce was a real slice of pure slapstick comedy, straight out of an episode from The Three Stooges.This film also contained a helluva lot of outright prejudice and antagonism towards the Japanese. I certainly won't go into any great detail about it here - But, I will say that the Japanese were all depicted as being a truly despicable bunch of pseudo-Nazi types.When it came to this picture's overall action sequences and the wonderful choreographing of its fight scenes, I was really quite surprised when I came to realize just how often these very scenes have been lifted and blatantly used, over and over again, in such films as The Matrix Reloaded, Kill Bill, and other such films.Anyways - In spite of all the wooden performances, the laughable dialog, and the terrible dubbing that prevailed, it was undeniably Bruce Lee, the ultimate master of martial arts, who shone magnificently throughout this very film that literally started the whole Kung Fu movie-craze over 40 years ago.

After The Big Boss, Bruce Lee was given much more creative control in acting and choreography; he broods, smolders, withdraws, erupts, and he insisted that blows actually connect during combat. His anger is palpable, so the catharsis is much more potent. Is there anything more life-affirming than that freeze-frame at the end? If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.I think it's creepy and vaguely anti-human that a film has to revolve around alienation, existential angst, emasculation and general victimhood to be seen as deep or academically important, as if introspection as anything other than an end in itself is somehow inherently fallacious. In a world that wasn't addicted to self-righteous wallowing and imagined oppressors, this would be seen on the same level as The Seventh Seal.

With his unparalleled skill in the Martial Arts, his unique style for choreography (based on his Jeet Kune Do philosophy) and overall, his great talent for acting, Lee quickly became the icon for Martial Arts films, and the biggest star at Golden Harvest Studios. The follow-up for The Big Boss, was a more traditional martial arts film Jing Wu Men (Fist of Fury). A period piece directed again by Lo Wei, Fist of Fury would take Lee's star even beyond.Set in 1908, the film is loosely based on the story of the Chin Woo Athletic Association, and the mysterious death of it's founder, the legendary Martial Artist Huo Yuanjia. Located in Shanghai, China, the Chin Woo school faces big problems now that their leader has died, as the Japanese occupation of Shanghai makes life very difficult for the Chinese. This makes Chen Zhen (Bruce Lee) furious, as he suspects the Japanese are behind the death of his master. As his investigation proves him right, Chen goes on a murder spree in order to avenge the death of Huo Yuanjia.Written and directed by Lo Wei, the film is a more straight forward Martial Arts film that follows almost to the letter the classic style that was dominating Hong Kong cinema at the time, with one important difference (add without a doubt Lee) the film favors a weaponless style of combat. Lo Wei's story, focuses mainly on the difficulties suffered by the Chinese with their land occupied by foreigners that used and abused the law for their advantage, and the rise of a hero to challenge the occupation. Many elements of the plot are centered around this nationalist pride, to the point of being overtly racist against the Japanese (this and other differences made Lee to decide to never work with Lo Wei again).While the story is definitely the one of a typical revenge story, it's in the execution where the film truly excels and shows why is considered a landmark in Hong Kong Action films. Now familiar with his star's abilities, director Lo Wei gives Bruce Lee enough freedom to direct and choreograph his own stunts, resulting in a better, more realist way of portraying Kung-Fu than in their previous film together (The Big Boss). Sadly, this also allows Lo Wei's flaws to be obvious when compared to Lee's directing style. Lo Wei focuses on telling a patriotic action-filled story of revenge, while Lee wants a stylish drama with lesson on Kung-Fu included (Lee would do this in his next film, Men Lung Guojiang or Way of the Dragon).To Lo Wei's credit, the discovery and eventual exploitation of Lee's natural talent for acting is one of the film's best characteristics. Bruce Lee finally gets a chance to show a lot more depth in small but significant scenes where he does comedy and melodrama in a remarkable way. While the rest of the cast is not as refreshing or surprising as Lee himself, there are two exceptions the beautiful Nora Miao (Lee's regular collaborator), and the excellent Ping-Ao Wei, who delivers a great performance as the treacherous Wu.Like in most Hong Kog films of its time, Jing Wu Men suffers from a really low-budget (although not as bad as The big Boss), some amateurish acting and an awful dubbing. However, this movie is one of Bruce Lee's most important films, as despite its flaws the legendary Martial Artist shows his best moves and his natural talent in an excellent way. Sure, Lo Wei's plot is not the most original and suffers from a lot of problems, but it also features some of Lee's best scenes in his tragically short career.Raw and gritty, yet somewhat stylish, this movie became a huge success and consolidated Lee as a major Action star. Personally, I prefer Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon over this film, however, Jing Wu Men, the Fist of Fury is an excellent Martial Arts film that set the standard for the explosion of Kung-Fu cinema that would follow it. 7/10 "},{"Title":"One of Bruce Lee's best!!","Date":"10 August 2004","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Romance","Review":"   This is after the big boss my favorite Bruce Lee's movies.

But such assumptions are unfair since they are mainly based on the heavily cesored, chopped and dubbed version, which is rightly, so laughably bad, as to not even warrant a rating.Now I like to think I have seen enough of films to know what is good and what is not and this in its original form is marvellous, although still not without its shortfalls i.e. some of the talky scenes, expecially the romance scenes.  But other then that the film, is powerful story (albeit straighforward), with the tradition/history associated with the myths and legends of the martial artists from yesteryear.  The film is fused with revenge, heroism and of course uncontrollable charisma! from a fully expressed Bruce Lee who plays the best role of his career (downside is the overly dispicable portrayal of the japanese - on par with Saving Private Ryan)Particularly impressive in the film is the build up of the raw, feral tension e.g. the funeral scene where a Lee dressed all in white is goaded by the translator.  Seen in widescreen you can really appreciate the composition of the fight scenes (although the budget means the scenery on offer is samey and a bit stagey).  Again Lee is influenced by the traditional samurai films (anyone familiar with Kurosawa's work will recall the Seven Samurai when Lee first enters the doorway to Suzuki's office) and notably the 'Dollars' trilogy (i.e the close up montage and build up of encounters).The fights feature Lee at his emotionally and maniacal best, particularly the underrated exchange between the Russian (Wall) even if its ruined by a few random hits, and the equally underrated if short, killing of the two imposters in the kitchen.  Most memorable however is the first dojo set piece and the cat like grace of an eluding Lee to a Samurai sword towards the end.Those who are lucky enough to see the nunchuka v samurai sword battle at the end will see one of the most thrilling sequences in cinema, since the shower scene from Pyscho, or the crop duster scene from North by Northwest, or the murder in Strangers by a Train etc, or the shootout in Good the Bad and the Ugly.The film is intellictually and overaly not on par with Kurosawa's best naturally, but is arguably just as, or more 'superficially' enjoyable. Also worth a mention is the powerfully downbeat ending.  The film revolutionaised action films and is universally the ultimate martial arts film - still providing unsurpassable enjoyment for those who enjoy a good enjoyable flick.Also look out for a cameo appearance from Steve Martin at the end!!

A year ago in my review of that film, I proclaimed Return of the Dragon (1972) as Lee's greatest Asian work, but I've been proved wrong since I hadn't seen The Chinese Connection and I was disappointed by Fists of Fury (1971). But director Wei Lo improved with this film, which features Lee as martial arts student Chen, who returns to Shanghai upon receiving news of the death of his beloved master. The story, set in 1908, has a timely vibe and pays close attention to the animosity growing between the students at a Chinese martial arts school and imposing Japanese occupation forces. When Chen investigates deeper into his master's death, he finds he may have been murdered, and sets out to find the culprits. The Chinese Connection is Lee's best Asian work to me. From the get-go, we can see that Chen is deeply saddened and angered, and pummels through all in his way as he embarks on a costly and dangerously bloodthirsty quest of vengeance. The scene at his master's funeral is especially disheartening and Lee shows respectable acting skills as his rage and emotions overpower him, and it takes a priest to have to knock him out with a shovel. Lee's Jeet Kune Do skills are at their peak in this work, fast and furious, delivering death-blows to all who oppose him, especially in the no-holds-barred confrontation between himself, a rock-hard Russian named Petrov (Robert Baker), and the ruling Japanese forces. The only real drawback to the whole experience is the decidedly racist and one-sided portrayal of all the Japanese as inherently evil.

It is pretty well-choreographed for the time and features a decent supporting cast and characters ( although the fact that all the police officers are sporting fedoras with their traditional garb is a bit ridiculous). Wu is a nice slimy villain, Petrov , portrayed by Robert Baker is a pretty good tough-guy, and the film builds up towards the final confrontation between the two quite well. Notice as well that in this movie, Bruce Lee is about ten pounds heavier than in his other feature films, and looks stronger. I prefer this look to the skinnier ( and thus, a bit more muscularly defined)version of Lee we see in Enter The Dragon. The music in this movie is another highlight, the sound effects used during the combat scenes coupled with slow-motion death blows are a nice touch ( check out the killer blow to the Japanese cook's sternum ) that add to the intensity and mortal nature of the violence being portrayed. The movie Fist Of Legend, which tells the same story about actual event sin Chinese history, is a decent film as well. One afternoon when time permits, watch both offering s back-to-back and you will find it well worth the time spent.

Yes, I know, in Way they're back door of restaurant, but its what happens there. I give Way 8, Enter 6 and Boss 7. In Enter the Dragon Lee was really skinny and he died, before the movie was released. The Big Boss has strong story, but not much fighting. OK, I made myself clear about other Lee movies, lets think about Fist of Fury. It starts with Lee arriving to his teachers funeral. Lee becomes so emotional, that he starts to dig with his hands mud off teachers coffin. Next scene, Lee hasn't eat anything in 2 days, he just sits in front of his teachers photo. Lee asks What killed my teacher? Little Unicorn answers It was cold. Lee replies He was wealthy man, nothing was wrong with him. Then Japanese arrive and give sign, that reads sick men of Asia. Lee nearly attacks Japanese, but remembers, what his teacher told to him be patient. I was really surprised in a good way, because the infamous house scene happens at 15 minutes mark. After that this movie becomes quite boring, but next action scene is Lee versus Ying-Chieh Han and other Japanese, they pretended to be Chinese, but Lee found out secret. Lee kills both and takes them to hang in pole. Japanese respond by attacking Chinese school. Next action scene is Lee with rickshaw and that gay dude from Way of the Dragon, Lee asks, that what happened to his teacher, gay answers, it was Suzuki, gay tries to surprise Lee, but Lee was alert and kills gay and again puts him to pole. Then Japanese have had it and they march to Chinese school and same time Lee goes to Japanese school and end fight begins. There are only few men in house, so Lee finishes them off quickly. Then its fat dude with glasses and he takes samurai sword, Lee kicks the sword and grabs fat dude and sword goes right through him. Then its Japanese backyard and Lee beats up few guys, after them its Lee versus Russian guy and that was pretty impressive fight, when Lee finishes Russian, its Lee versus Suzuki and Suzuki surprises Lee with Samurai sword, but Lee has his weapon and Lee kicks Suzuki through paper wall and when Suzuki flew, the stunt was made by Jackie Chan. After that scene Lee shows up to police and they shoot Lee. End of movie. We had young and rising superstars in Jackie Chan, Biao Yuen, Corey Yuen and Wah Yuen. Then again we had veteran actors in Ying-Chieh Han (1927-1991) and Feng Tien (Born 1928 and still alive, while I'm making this review).

However, I think in Fists Of Fury, Bruce gives his most intense performance of all of his films. When Chen Zen's master dies under mysterious circumstances and is harassed by a rival Japanese school, Chen(Bruce Lee) kicks the crap out of the Japanese school. This causes conflict between the school, Chen and the Japanese which results in a series of back and forth fighting until the film's conclusion. Bruce is at his most intense and the fighting is almost non stop. Bruce is rage incarnate in this film and his presence and performance is second to none.

As a result Shanghai was considered an international city in which the major powers at the time pretty much used as they saw fit. Anyway, it's during this time that a martial arts student by the name of Chen Zhen (Bruce Lee) returns to the dojo that meant so much to him. When he arrives he finds that his beloved master has died and is in the process of being buried. After a few days of intense bereavement Chen angrily demands to know how his master died. When told the official diagnosis was pneumonia Chen immediately rejects that explanation and suspects a more sinister cause. Not long afterward some members of a nearby Japanese dojo arrive and disrespectfully taunt those who are paying a final homage to their late master. This infuriates Chen who decides to take matters into his own hands and pay a visit to the rival dojo later that night. Now, rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was one of the first martial arts films shown to American audiences and it made a huge impression at the time. Even so, while it is certainly good, I don't consider it to be the best martial arts film ever made. I say this because the dubbing on the film that I watched was extremely bad. Additionally, the first fight scene between Bruce Lee and Yi Feng (as the Japanese martial arts instructor named Yoshida) was rather pathetic. Along with that the film quality wasn't exactly top-notch either. On the plus side this movie features the best martial arts expert to have ever acted on screen bar none. Likewise, with the exception of the fight scene mentioned earlier, the rest of the combat scenes were quite excellent. I especially liked the fight between Chen and Petrov (Robert Baker). I also liked the addition of Nora Miao (as Yuen Le-erh). Be that as it may I thought this was a good movie and I rate it as slightly above average.

Bruce lee, jet-li, Donnie yen, and Vincent zhao. one was even a world champion(jet-li) for a few years. Jackie, sammo, and yuen baio don't count, because they studied peking opera dance and acrobatics. my favorite out of all of them is Bruce lee. mark my words, just like there will never be another James Dean, there will never be another Bruce lee. the mans a legend and he had a total of four completed films, the last one in 1973, after that there were countless imitations. so if you are a true fan of Bruce lee, his last completed film was enter the dragon in 1973. he was about to take the world by storm right before his death.OK, on to the movie...the setting is pre-world war 2 shanghai China, and it is about his masters poisoning death by the hands of the Japanese, while Bruce was away. he comes back for the funeral and is immediately suspicious unlike his other classmates.the investigation goes deeper, he finds out people from his school were directly involved with the death and the bodies start piling-up from there on. the pacing got a little bit slow during the middle but thats okay, it wasn't just a kung-fu movie, there was serious acting in it too. it is just the awesome imagery Bruce lee conveys when he is doing his thing...it is like on a visceral level impossible to duplicate. i love kung-fu movies in general but i have to say, there is no one like Bruce Lee...his style was his own and everybody tried to imitate him and everybody failed miserably or it was just meant to be comical. forget about other kung-fu movie stars trying to imitate him..., ever since i can remember(early 1980's)of my childhood in NYC, i would see him on TV, i walk down the street and guys are imitating him, i see t-shirts of him and this is in the United States...i can imagine how crazy it must have been in Hong Kong.when Bruce lee did his moves they look so real and he was incredibly quick, like a cat and the closest i've seen in speed is jet li. watching Bruce lee beat up bad-guys is like a guilty pleasure that you don't mind. there is so many classic images from this movie and they are like burned into my mind and i will never forget those images...the initial dojo fight, the ending where the shot ends on a freeze frame and like a hundred other shots in the movie. this movie is bleaker then his other three films, but it was shot beautifully, more so then the other 3 films.thank you for your 4 completed films and may your legend and myth live on forever!

Chen Zhen (Lee), a student at the Jing-wu Mun School of martial arts, returns home to find that his master Fok Yun Gap (who was actually a real-life master - the photos you see in the movie on his shrine are those of the real guy) has died suddenly. The funeral and eulogy are broken up when members of Master Suzuki (Riki Hoshimoto)'s neighbouring Bushido School, together with their interpreter Mr Wu (Wei Ping-Ao, 'Way Of The Dragon', 'Ninja In The Dragon's Den'), who brings them a 'present' - a sign with the Chinese symbols for 'Sick Man Of Asia'. This greatly angers Chen, so, after having been forbidden to exact his ever-growing fury at the prejudice on Wu and the Japanese during the funeral, he later pays them a visit and single-handedly defeats all of the Japanese students with his incredible fighting skills.After a revenge attack from the Japanese on the Jing-wu school and its students (which includes a guy played by a pre-cosmetic surgery Jackie Chan), Chen is asked to leave for the school's sake. He refuses, and stays the night, but soon has his peace disturbed when he finds out that something more sinister may have been responsible for the death of Sifu Fok Yun Gap...This was not only considered to be Bruce Lee's most defining role as he defends his fellow Chinese against prejudice from the Japanese (his most famous scenes, which caused raucous cheer, are (a) the line where he says 'We Chinese are not sick', and (b) the bit involving the racially-discriminating 'No Dogs or Chinese Allowed' sign outside the park).Note that even though Han Yin-Chieh is listed as the fight coordinator, Bruce Lee actually choreographed the fight scenes he was in (you can tell because of the different overall feel of those which did not feature him, which looked limp and unrealistic in comparison). Lee surrendered credit to Han out of respect for an elder. as well as pointing out key actors and actresses, including ones who would later make it big (look out for people such as Jackie Chan, Yuen Wah and a brief appearance from 'Mr Vampire' star Lam Ching-Ying). If you were a bit disappointed by the hokery in 'The Big Boss', don't let that put you off this one. Lee's first scrap doesn't take long to kick in (pun fully intended), and all his fights are far more impressive. In fact, fans cite this as containing the best fights of his tragically short career, as well as showing him and Nora Miao sharing what would be his only screen kiss.

I was expecting to be a little bit bored by a bunch of fake action events and no worthwhile plot. I soon found however that the movie was quite intriguing from the start, and for more reasons than one. First thing is, I didn't know that Bruce Lee could ACT. He's got this charisma, which on one hand goes part and parcel with the intensity of fierceness during the fight, yet on the other hand, he's no one-dimensional character either, and there are a lot of good dramatic scenes between characters in between the fights. Actually on-screen drama time is quite a bit more minute for minute than fight scenes, which I was happy to discover. Oh, there is definitely enough fighting, but not to the detriment of the story which grows and develops suspensefully.'Fist of Fury', set in colonial Shanghai times, is the story of a Japanese martial arts school trying to shut down a Chinese one, to which Lee belongs, after killing their master, and is the basis for a lot of very good fight scenes and just a touch of humor as Lee goes fugitive and then evading the law and donning a variety of disguises, single handedly takes them down one by one (and sometimes all together at the same time). This synopsis however doesn't do justice to the atmosphere of the story, the resonant feeling of 1970s old Shanghai, rich in violence and Japanese/Chinese historic background. I can see now why Bruce Lee is still revered as the icon of bad@ss 70s cool - but his personality carried very well into scenes beyond the fight, unlike say Jet Li.

ETD is slicker but the few fight scenes that there are in this film are among Bruce Lee's best in my opinion. The reason is that he is acting while fighting. He is supposed to be this crazy guy who is driven mad by his masters murder and this sure comes through in the fight scenes. Two in particular are when he kills the guy involved in poisoning his master ( acted by the same guy who was the Big Boss in the first Chinese Martial Arts Film Lee did ) 'Why did you kill my teacher then?' and then at the Japanese school when he says ' I will allow you to leave, Scram, Scram, Scraaaam!' Pure magic. Also the fight against the Russian allows Bruce to show off some excellent Kung fu skills ( apart from the silly hand waving scene,what was that supposed to be about? ) When Bruce switches styles from Kung Fu, Karate and Western Boxing to confuse the Russian it is Bruce showing Jeet Kune Do at it's best. The film has it's silly comic elements, like the rickshaw throwing scene, but this was probably Lo Wei's (Director) idea. And the love scenes with Nora Mao are too long and unnecessary. All the other fighters in the film look really amateurish compared to Bruce with one or two exceptions. The scene where the Japanese boss flies through the wall after Bruce kicks him is actually a young Jackie Chan as a stunt man. Jackie mentions in his biography that he was the only stunt man willing to do that scene as it involved landing on his back. Jackie is also the stunt man who has his neck broken by Bruce in Enter the Dragon. All in all I still enjoy this film having watched it probably over 30 times.

THE BIG BOSS comes to mind. Well crafted for a low budget movie, it also boasts THE breakout superstar performance by Bruce Lee. Everything's pretty low key until it happens, but, when it does, it's the kind of game-changing play that makes movie-making history. Bruce Lee's charismatic explosion instantly blows everything else off the map. Every action star who came before (or since, in my opinion) is immediately taken down a notch- and not necessarily by dint of any shortcomings on their part; Bruce Lee was- and is, for all time- the world's greatest martial arts movie star. And this is the movie that introduced him to the world.The follow-up, THE Chinese CONNECTION, was better still- One for the ages, as they say, with an even greater focus on the martial arts skills that he'd taken a lifetime to master (or to EVOLVE, to be more precise). Even the fight scenes in THE BIG BOSS pale by comparison. While it doesn't take his character as long to mix it up with the bad guys this time around, the tension nonetheless builds to an almost unbearable degree before he lets his fists fly. FISTS OF FURY, indeed- and the use of the nunchaku in the big showdown with the Japanese fighters only adds injury to more injury. When he uncovers the murderers (by recognizing the Japanese undergarments they're wearing), there's even MORE hell to pay. The lulls between the spectacular fight scenes don't detract from the action at all- and, indeed, serve to keep us glued to the edge of our seats in anticipation. When the end comes, it's well worth the wait and Lee's final scene is at once heroic and poignant. Without a doubt, THE Chinese CONNECTION is one of the top five martial arts movies of all time (in my book, behind only ENTER THE DRAGON and WAY OF THE DRAGON). The fight scenes for the unfinished GAME OF DEATH were greater still and proof positive that Bruce Lee was continuing to evolve as an actor, a martial artist, and a filmmaker.

He returns to the city to marry his fiancé but finds out that his master had died. He questions the official reason about how he was killed and the Japanese Bushidō school seek to close Chen's school. The Japanese plan to arrest Chen, learn the secret of the Fist of Fury and arrest every member of the school.

The acting isn't exactly good. Bruce Lee and Nora Miao are the strongest performs. This film's winning feature (and the whole point of watching this type of film) is the martial arts sequence.

Excellent viewing.The film also has a couple of themes. There is the themes of vengeance and actions have consequence for everyone involved. There is also a major theme about Chinese and Japanese racism and the hatred the two nations have to each other.

When Chen Zhen discovers Jing Wu's master was murdered, he sets out on a one-man mission to make the Japanese pay for their crime. But has he considered the consequences of his actions ?This, the second of Bruce Lee's four Jeet Kune Do classics, is pretty solid entertainment throughout. Okay, so some of the acting is out of a silent movie, and the dubbing in the English-language version isn't the greatest, but none of that really matters. What does matter is Lee, who is hypnotic and sensational - his passion for what he is doing and the sheer physical originality of the man is awesome, even in a film nearly forty years old. The showpiece one-against-thirty nunchaku fight in the dojo is one of the best and most influential fight scenes in cinema, with Lee at his most balletic. He also shines when allowed to drop into disguises; a silver-haired old street-vendor, and a goofy-toothed telephone repairman. Director Lo (who also plays the procrastinating police inspector) steals from various sources - big Sergio Leone closeups, swordplay from Kurosawa's samurai films, James Bond-style superfast editing, the ending of Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid - but keeps coming up with interesting scenes and exploits Lee's action hero skills for maximum effect. A Golden Harvest production, this is top-notch fare for the discerning chop-socky fan. The English title is Fist Of Fury. Made by many of the same cast and crew as Lo's earlier Tang Shan Da Xiong (also known as The Big Boss, and, confusingly, Fists Of Fury). Bruce Lee is the James Dean of action cinema; sadly, he only made a handful of movies before his untimely death, but his legacy is as powerful and pervasive today (see The Matrix and Kill Bill films, and just about any half-decent modern action flick, not to mention digital entertainment like Namco's Tekken series of videogames) as it has ever been.

I was impressed with them in ways that I hadn't noticed on previous viewings. Of course, Lee's athleticism and martial arts prowess are well on display here. That's to be expected. But there is more at work here than that. Far more. Lee displays a polish as an actor and film star here. He's playing a character who can best be described as a loose cannon, someone who is psychologically unhinged by the death of his mentor and father figure. This is displayed immediately by his over-the-top reaction at his master's funeral. From that point on we see him responding, scene by scene, in an obsessive way. He pursues his master's killers relentlessly, despite the costs to himself, his friends, the woman he loves, and his cherished school.

That makes this Lee's visually most powerful film.To this, Lee adds a strong story, a great hero, utterly detestable villains, and a willingness to try out some tactics & techniques he learned in Hollywood - the scene where Lee disguises himself as a telephone repair man is completely atypical of this genre at the time, but was common in American thrillers (compare, for instance, the early scene in the French Connection where cloudy has lunch in the suspect's diner).And I say Lee did this, because no stretch of the imagination could allow Lo Wei the benefit of the doubt as to who really directed this film. If Lee isn't actually directing, he certainly put the production package together, and probably brought in another director. This is definitely Lee insisting on a star-quality production for a star-quality action performer. The only other credited to Lo Wei that comes close to this in quality is Dragon Fist, an early Jackie Chan film which I also suspect as not having been directed by Lo.The reason for this is simple Lo, a former actor (he plays the detective in the present film), shows interest in scene staging and camera technique in pretty much NO other film credited to him; nor can I accept the notion of some fluke of genius happening here.No, this is Bruce Lee's film from start to finish - and it is the best looking with the strongest story, best pacing, most dramatic. Besides which, Lee's own fight scenes are unforgettably audacious, of course - and largely remain so, after more than 30 years! - for a genre film that nearly says it all. Remains a classic, and worth watching more than once.

I always enjoyed this one but never as much as The Big Boss or Way Of The Dragon, because this one seems a bit too plot driven and while this is okay the fact that it's badly dubbed, simplistic in its approach and somewhat slow at times, Fist Of Fury isn't my favorite Bruce Lee movie. However that being said, Bruce Lee not at his best is still often vastly superior to anything from Chuck Norris or really anything for that matter. The other thing I found genuinely interesting was the fascinating rage it fosters toward the Japanese, all of them in this film are 100% evil and this rage extends to the Russian bad guy and any Chinese who betrays his people and therefore it provides a fascinating time capsule look in the same way the 80's offer a fascinating look in their right wing politics.

The intensity of the fight sequences is what stuck with me, starting from his first confrontation of the Japanese school, where he dispatches every student (and the head instructor) with ruthless efficiency.Chinese angst over powerful and unwanted Japanese influence in the country is a predominant theme. The second strong theme, poignant at the end, is the question of restraint versus revenge, and the cost of each. A love interest adds some flavour but is secondary to the main object revenge against the Japanese responsible for the master's death.The intensity increases as Chen is not satisfied anymore with just maiming enemies but goes on a killing spree of revenge. The final fight scenes including the Russian strongman Petrov are extremely intense and a joy to watch, especially when Lee breaks out the nunchaku against the Japanese master's sword.Highly recommended!

While the marital arts are outstanding, his enlivened performance and signature mannerisms does truly stand-out. Raw, but heartfelt in delivery and more often level- headed with aggressive live-wire bursts. Inspired by true events Lee plays Chen Jun, a student of legendary martial artist Fok Yun Gap who returns to the school in Shanghai after the death of his teacher. There he learns there might just be more to it, as he uncovers a Japanese martial arts school is behind his master's death. Throughout the plot there's quite a strong standing of race conflict (infamous jump-kick of a sign No dogs or Chinese allowed at the entrance of a park) interwoven within the themes of revenge and injustice. Director Lo Wei workably allows the film to steadily flow with slick guidance, as Lee slowly moves from one scene to another with complete mastery of his skills, which is magnificently photographed. The jarring martial arts are vicious in detail, but realistically pitched with maximum force, rhythm and flair like Lee's bruising encounter with Robert Baker's Russian enforcer. In between those moments it can slow-up, as it has Lee investigating his master's death, causing race confrontations, bad guys living it up and Lee romancing Nora Miao. But it those moments when he uses his rage (and those nun-chucks!) on the meddling Japanese imperialists. Director Wei artistically gets the period etchings and decorated costumes spot on, even though some set-pieces are obvious set- designs but the colour plateau shines through. The rest of the cast Tony Liu, Kam Shan, Lee Kwan, Fung Ngal and James Tein do acquit themselves well. A gallant and feisty Hong Kong martial arts fable that ends on an honourably iconic final shot.Now you listen to me. I'll only say it once. We are not sick men.

The plot is no different to thousands of other martial arts films, but Lee lifts the material a huge amount as he does with all his other films. The film uses the backdrop of the traditional hatred between the Chinese and Japanese, and uses this to portray the Japanese as slimy, backstabbing bastards who use Kantana swords against unarmed men (But still loose).I could go on for ages about how there isn't any characterisation and basically nothing special besides the action, but if you are watching a Bruce Lee film you shouldn't be looking for these things in the first place. And you won't be disappointed as the action on display here is some of the best Lee has offered. The climax featuring the fight with the Russian wrestler is nowhere near the same level as Lee's legendary fight with Chuck Norris in Way of the Dragon, but it is bloody and brilliant nether the less. As with The Big Boss, there is some unnecessary nudity and other rather pointless scenes that add nothing to the film, but at the same time do not detract anything from its chop socky nature. Given most of the running time consists of people dying and being hung from lamp posts, if this actually bothers you, you shouldn't really be watching a HK martial arts film in the first place.The supporting cast includes many regular Lee collaborators, including the beautiful Nora Miao as his love interest. Again, many of them don't have much to do because after all this is Lee's show. The action and violence rarely lets up and with a somewhat downbeat ending unlike WOTD and Enter the Dragon, you shouldn't finish the film feeling you got anything less than what you expected.

He soon understands that his master was killed by a rival master, and uncovers a world of crime and prejudice. However, he knows that taking on the bad guys will probably cost him his own life.

As Chen Chen, a young student at a martial arts school in Japan-occupied Shanghai in the late 19th century, Lee is spectacular, playing his scenes with an enraged intensity that's sometimes overwhelming. The plot hinges on the mysterious death of the school's master, the responsibility for which Chen traces to a rival Japanese Bushido school in town. Fights ensue, with Chen taking on just about everyone single-handedly in some stunning sequences that are still effective 30 years later. The film addresses the more-than-strained relations between Chinese and Japanese at the time, exacerbated by the institutional racism of the latter, head-on, and Chen's rage at his teacher's murder becomes the suppressed fury of an entire culture.

I'm sorry if a lower than perfection rating offends anyone who sees Bruce Lee as a cinematic god &#x96; but at the same time I wonder if half the guys who rock his many bootleg T shirts are devotees or merely guys who went to Hong Kong once for a few days.In Fist of Fury Chen (Lee) arrives home in Shanghai after a long absence to find his beloved Master has died unexpectedly after a duel with a Japanese fighter from a rival school. It must be mentioned that at the time the Japanese occupied Shanghai by force and treated the local Chinese as less than dogs &#x96; might now be a good time to point out I'm pretty sure Chen eats a dog on a spit in one scene? Let's say Chen handles the death of his master&#x85; badly. Things are not helped when members of the Japanese martial arts school show at his funeral to stir things up, for the good name of the school no-one reacts to the taunts and the intruders are allowed to leave somewhat victorious.Only Chen ain't going out like that, the next day he pays their school a visit and systematically dismantles everyone in attendance, including the old, wise, fat master &#x96; who obviously was cast for his acting and can't fight for sh*t.This sleight doesn't go down well with the Japanese who send a group down to apprehend Chen and end up in an all-in brawl with the Chinese students instead, the Japanese tell the school that they have three days to hand over Chen or they'll dob on him&#x85; I know you are but what am I stuff indeed.So the back and forth goes on for the rest of the film, the Japanese keep taunting and giving demands, the Chinese want nothing to do with things but don't want Chen to get killed and aside from his pigtailed ladyfriend have no idea where he is, and Chen himself lies low, using a bunch of terrible disguises to infiltrate and get information. He picks off conspirators and those responsible for the death of his Master as the facts are uncovered.Eventually of course things come to a head and a big showdown is inevitable with Chen vs the entire Japanese school&#x85; PLUS a Russian muscleman that they brought in especially for the situation &#x96; and so they could have a scene where he bends rubber props made to look like metal.I think that they also wanted to easily differentiate some of the major bad guys, so they give one heavy a bizarre ginger wig and paint ludicrous sideburns on the Japanese leader to frame an equally fake looking mo. The Russian mercenary too rocks a dangerously bad perm, though that unfortunately might have been real.It must be said that Fist of Fury gets better as it goes along, the first half is a little slow and the fights dull, uninspired and flat. But as Chen gets angrier and angrier Bruce gets to display more of what made him great, the fights don't flow as well as some of Jackie Chan's (who was the stuntman that pulled off the huge fall signifying the end of the film by the way) but they do highlight Lee's athleticism and magnetism.Even in the scenes where he is simple seething about and pondering &#x96; which are many &#x96; you can't take your eyes off him, his determined jaw and heavy eyebrows make him always seem thoughtful and ready, and there was a fair chance that that was the case.It is unfair to martial arts lovers that Bruce Lee was taken so soon, he could have made another dozen classic films to complete his legacy and redefine an entire cinematic genre (he could also have gotten lazy and fat and busted out easy cash-ins like Adam Sandler has for a decade).As it stands we'll have to watch Enter the Dragon over and over &#x96; or my preference read biographies or watch docos about the real Bruce Lee, a far more interesting, noble and complex character than any he played on screen.Fist of Fury must therefore stand as an intriguing appetiser for a main course that started with Enter the Dragon but was never allowed to finish.Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 / 10. Builds momentum in the second half as Bruce is allowed more room to move, probably my favourite Bruce film after Enter the Dragon.

Unfortunately, during the 1970s, many kung-fu movies were horribly dubbed into English--with voices that didn't sound the least bit Asian or appropriate to the characters. In addition, the sound effects were WAY over the top--with the loudest crunching sounds you'll ever hear in a film! While I don't mind the super-loud slapping and crunching sounds, I hated the dubbing and really wish the movie had been presented in its original form with subtitles. Now I am sure some insanely biased fans of Bruce Lee will think I am attacking him or trashing the movie. On the contrary, I am attacking the ham-fisted way foreigners butchered the film and showed little regard for the material. This was all part of a three DVD set from St. Clair Video entitled Samurai Collection--though few of the films had anything to do with samurai--most were kung-fu movies (kung-fu is a style of marital arts, whereas a samurai is a Japanese version of a knight).The film itself is entertaining and needs a bit of historical background to help the viewer to understand what is happening. In the 19th and 20th century, China was a very weak nation with a string of inept leaders. As a result, greedy nations of Europe began forcing their way into the country and carved up this large nation into foreign zones which were basically colonies within China. The most famous of these was Hong Kong, though the film is set in Shanghai. A bit later, the US and Japan also got involved in this colonialism and the Japanese dominating and taking advantage of the Chinese is the setting for the film. It is set in the early 20th century and the film plays up the natural hatred of the Japanese among the Chinese (for more information, try googling Nanking). In this case, a group of evil Japanese Karate experts (they are mistranslated as samurai) and their dojo come to beat up the nice local kung-fu practitioners. They start by poisoning the leader of the Chinese school and then begin beating the crap out of the nice Chinese. The only one to stand up to them and fight back is Bruce Lee.As for the rest of the film, it's almost non-stop action and it's truly amazing to see Lee fight so fast. Unfortunately, though the choreography isn't what it was in later films--even later Lee films. It's a lot of super-fast punching and kicking. Vey impressive, yes--but appearing very spontaneous and less cool as later kung-fu videos. For example, although Jackie Chan seems to be less fast or insane when he fights (definite pluses for Lee), he uses props very well and his fights are more visually impressive because of this. Still, Lee is the grand-daddy of all martial artists and it's an entertaining film if you can find a subtitled copy---if it exists.FYI--Since this movie is set in the 20th century, most people who watch this film MUST be thinking why don't they just shoot him and end this fighting machine once and for all?!. I know I sure did!

Unlike the juvenile The Big Boss, the immature Way of the Dragon or the Utterly silly Enter the Dragon, this movie is one of the most emotionally deep films about racism and equal rights next to Speilberg's Schindler's List.  Many people criticise Fist of Fury because Bruce fought like a maniac, screaming his trademark scream that has been shamelessly lampooned in bad Sprite commercials.  It is NOT intended to be comical.  It is meant to be an expression of the deep and profound rage and sorrow that Bruce's Character, Chen Zhen, felt as his race is bullied like dogs by the Japanese.  It is not surprising that the audience in the 1972 premier stood up and cheered in an unison of National Pride when Chen Smashed the infamous No Dogs and Chinese Allowed sign.  This film showed that the Chinese (or in Bruce's philosophy, any race) has the equal right to live and cannot be so easily bullied. Thank you, Lo Wei; although you almost ruined Jackie Chan's career, you have truly made a masterpiece of Racial Equality.

I don't know anything about martial arts, but I do know a good kick to the face when I see one. The problem with this one, other than the bad acting and the abysmal dubbing, is that too much of the story is just plain filler. Fist of Fury is at least fifteen minutes too long, something which could easily have been resolved by removing that silly romance between Bruce and that not-so-hot chick. That part of the story just didn't lead up to anything, and it is safe to say that Bruce Lee doesn't exactly excel in scenes which require anything else from him than his usual ass-kicking and high pitched yelling. Nevertheless, if you are up for some intense, and many times hilarious, fight scenes, then check this one out. You could always get another beer from the kitchen, microwave yesterdays dinner or something like that, during the dull spots. "}]
