I didn't realize it was a John Sayles movie until I saw his name on the credits and then I thought it might be something different; I don't associate Sayles with simple family movies.  But in fact, this is pretty much the movie I was hoping for, full of Irish charm and blarney, beautiful filmed and full of magic and wonder.  One hesitates to call it a children's movie or a family movie because those are generally awful, but it is very much the sort of movie that is perfect to take the family too (although it is unaccountably rated PG).  But it's not *just* a kid's movie, it's a movie with magic for anyone, and I would put it in the same category as Alfonso Cuar√≥n's A Little Princess, another movie that treats children not in the Disney aren't-they-cute way but as real thinking individuals.  This is a lovely drama featuring a child rather than a kid's movie, but it works on either level.

She's a little girl lost at the beginning when we meet her, wandering through the smog of the city to find some way to latch onto her father who is lost and sad with grief over a dead wife and a dead and missing baby boy.  Her true quest begins when she is sent to live with her grandparents who still live by the sea.

In essence, this is a children's movie, and only through Sayles' brilliance are we adults allowed in.Roan Inish is a deserted island off the coast of Donegal, where Fiona's mother died and her baby brother was lost at sea.  Her father has moved to the city but Fiona is sent back to live with her grandparents for her health.  Her grandparents live on the coast opposite Roan Inish, having moved off the island at the same time.  In fact, the Conneelys have a very special bond with Roan Inish, as Fiona starts to discover as she talks with the local townfolk, especially to a dark and brooding relative named Tadhg.  Tadhg tells her about the selkie -- a shapeshifter of Irish lore who is half-seal and half-human -- and why Roan Inish is so important to the family.  From that, Fiona must unravel the mystery of what happened to her baby brother.I don't want to spoil any of the story, so rather than recount any more of the plot, I'll just tell you that all the performances are wonderful.  Mick Lally as the grandfather especially shines, as does Eileen Colgan as the grandmother.  Jeni Courtney is terrific as young Fiona and Richard Sheridan as Eamonn, her young cousin, is very good too.  In fact, I couldn't pick out any bad performances at all.The Secret of Roan Inish features some beautiful Irish music, both instrumental and Irish-language, and of course features lush cinematography of the Donegal area and coast.  Beautifully shot, wonderfully written and performed, and masterfully directed, The Secret of Roan Inish will delight everyone in the family.  Don't hesitate to buy or rent this one.

It does not jump up and grab your attention or startle you, it just gradually lays out a very magical yet timeless story. It is a story about love, found and lost, and a little girl who refuses to believe that she has lost a beloved family member. It is told through her magical eyes and the Irish background and characters that cross her path easily come to life. I watch this movie whenever I need to relax and just get away from the everyday craziness of life. It is well worth the time. This movie reminds me of, The Winter Guest, by Alan Rickman.

Jeni Courtney turns in an excellent and completely believable performance as Fiona who learns about the legend of the selkie and uses it to find her little brother Jimmy who had disappeared at sea at an infant.

This shouldn't be too difficult for moviegoers weaned on Star Wars and Die Hard.  Let's hope so because The Secret of Roan Inish is a rare movie, a fairy tale, told from a child?s perspective, but for adults as well as children.Roan Inish is an island off the coast of western Ireland from which 10-year-old Fiona's family has recently decamped for the mainland because of hard times. Now directly across the water from their beloved island, Fiona's grandparents take her in after her city-living father can no longer care for her. And there are secrets. Unbeknownst to Fiona there is a branch of her family descended from Selkies, beings half seal and half human. Unlike mermaids though, Selkies are either all human or all seal, depending on their mood. And if you can catch a human Selkie, they're yours until they discover where you've hid their seal skin. And with a beautiful female, Fiona's grandfather did just that, married her, raised a family, but alas one day she finds her seal skin and she's off to the sea. This legend segues into a modern mystery and a challenge Fiona must face.Slow paced, beautifully photographed, well acted and directed, this is a unique gem of a movie.

Most of all, I love that all of the characters are allowed their humanity and dignity.  Fiona, the 10 year girl who is at the center of the film, follows her curiosity in a brave but realistic way, never spouting wise cracks so common with most American child characters.  Imagine being told an old family story by your favorite Uncle or Grandfather while sitting around a living room late at night, with only the low light provided by the glow of a fire or one old lamp so nothing distracts your imagination's journey.

Jamie disappeared a few years earlier, and hints begin to emerge that he may have been carried off by the many seals that haunt the island where he lived.Fiona is portrayed quite well. Although she looks frail physically, she nevertheless conveys a deep strength and fearlessness as she uncovers strange elements of her family's past and begins to believe that Jamie may still be aliveThe Irish setting is played up very strongly. There are lovely seascapes and good use of Irish music. The faces of the people are very evocative as well, with many rugged, homely appearances that feel very honest and comfortable. The magical elements are portrayed seriously and delicately without getting too corny -- no dancing leprechauns.The messages of the film are done intelligently, without much dialogue, relying mostly on visuals. One thing I noticed in a second viewing is how much of the time the film shows people working. It opens up in a tough-looking laundromat or factory of some sort, and many of the key scenes are set with the main characters talking while they are busy with the work of their daily lives. There is an important scene where children labor especially hard for something that has a strong influence on the resolution of the story. At no time is there an overt quote about working, but the importance of labor comes through seeing people do it.Roan Inish works well for young children as well. My younger sons were swept into it, although it is quite unlike any film they had seen before. They definitely thought it was unusual, but they seemed to enjoy the characters and situations and had a lot of interested questions about what was going on.

The character of Fiona (played by Jeni Courtney) is like every free and beautiful little girl that you've ever encountered rolled into one. She has such a wonderful outlook on life; honest and serious, faithful and fanciful. This is an improbable film for director John Sayles, an American filmmaker who usually sticks much closer to home. More pleasing still is the fact that he takes an honest, unfiltered view of the Irish culture that is so intrinsic to the story being told.The Secret of Roan Inish is about storytelling, from an inner and outer perspective. Each character is deeply concerned with sharing his or her own tale or take on local folklore. The script takes all sorts of beautiful sidelines into the tales of Fiona's relatives and anyone else who happens to pass by. Particularly fascinating is the performance of John Lynch, whose character tells the legend of the Selkie (played by his sister, Susan Lynch). The images of the seal woman are breathtaking, painful in their uncertain waking beauty.The final result of the film is something between the purity of childhood and the trust of self. I was taken in not only by the overwhelming sense of the unknown, but by everything fearful and wonderful in the making known of the same. This is one of the most enrapturing motion pictures I've ever seen.

Roan Inish weaves its magic through the well written dialogue of characters who tell the story of a family ancestor who was a mythological selkie, as well as the lost infant raised by seals who populate the abandoned island. They comment on the loss of native language and culture by a generation of young islanders who left for jobs in the city. The return of a small island girl to her grandparents permits director John Sayles to examine with the girl, the island's history, and its community whose knowledge is grounded in oral history and the past. Set in the post-war economy, desire to leave the old ways to incorporate benefits of modern urban life is seen only briefly as intrusive on the people whose community is intimately tied to the sea. The strength of the film is in how it presents the need and place of intergenerational knowledge, the preservation of the language, and the unique place of ethnic heritage based in oral traditions.What sets this film apart from others is how it is a family film without resorting to clich√©s, but instead, is the kind of movie entertaining to all age groups without talking down to anyone. That the film was not better marketed is likely the fault of the studio that did not know how to sell the film's idea to American audiences grown accustomed to mindless car chases, exploding buildings, and gratuitous violence as well as irritating, smart-mouth kid actors. Roan Inish has none of these elements although the brief nudity of one child actor could offend some who would find offense in any presentation of the human form in any context. But for this, the film allows audiences to be drawn into the story of children who value and desire to restore their heritage and family, and take responsibility to act.The production values of this film are high, its plot thoroughly believable. DP Haskell Wexler uses the beauty of the Irish countryside to paint a stunning image of the landscape and sea that makes one wish to return to the old sod. Sayles's cast are character actors not familiar to most audiences in the US, but who are able to carry the film with authenticity and grace. The child actors are especially mature and believable. This is a film that should be seen by more audiences but probably won't and that is unfortunate for The Secret of Roan Inish is a gem in a sea of mediocre Hollywood fare.

It's a movie that works quietly for its effects.The first thing I have to comment on is the beautiful setting of the film and the photography. The setting is the west coast of Ireland, in a small fishing village, and on the sea and the land around the village. I believe Secret is as successful at conveying the rugged beauty of this landscape and seascape as any movie made. No tricks, no special effects, just the beauty of a place that has a lot of history and mythology associated with it.The actors and actresses in this film are not big names and not well-known, and I would say that this is a movie that is more story-driven than character-driven. At the same time, the lack of name actors or big bravura performances works to the advantage of the film, in that the personalities of the actors are submerged in the plot.There is a lot of kindness in this film, and a sense of the people being really connected to one another and caring for and about each other, and about the land and time they live in. That's one of the things that I loved about this film there are no real villains, nothing evil. Nobody is considered stupid or demeaned in any way.

Well this review is dedicated in its entirety to the isle of Roan Inish, all Irish, no Japan-inish. John Sayles has spent most of his stellar career as a writer-director documenting the making of modern America with the searing, masterfully-woven race relations dramas Lone Star and Sunshine State and the classic coming-of-age film Baby It's You, which doubles as a portrait of the immigrant experience. This change-of-pace outing finds him amidst the myths and mysteries of rural Ireland, where a 10-year-old girl is hunting for the baby brother who was swept to sea when her family evacuated its remote island home. The film builds slowly, mesmerisingly towards a cathartic act of mercy, incorporating several nuanced diversions which either bolster the narrative or flesh out its highly evocative portrait of a sea-faring community.Medium Cool director Haskell Wexler's lustrous cinematography and a soundtrack of Celtic folk songs add to the very special atmosphere, while the sensitive performances remain doggedly unsentimental, young Jeni Courtney representing the movie's poetic but earthy sensibility as the resourceful, single-minded heroine. Meanwhile, Sayles' unmatched ear for dialogue is as attuned as ever, his empathy for the characters reinforced by inventive direction that sees the world from Courtney's height for its first five minutes. Roan Inish is a tender, affecting and ultimately magical film - and one of the best few I'll see this year. RZA was unavailable for comment.

Working with a virtually unknown Irish cast, Sayles brings to life a story that wanders on the borderland between mystical and blue-collar realism, without becoming cloying or simplistic. The only film to which i think Roan Inish can be effectively compared is Whale Rider, but with no insult intended to Whale Rider, to me Roan Inish is a richer and more complex film. The basic story concerns the relationship between humans and non-humans and how long- standing relationships between species can be torn apart by world events; in this case the Second World War, which forces a community of Irish fisherfolk to relocate to the mainland. A young girl, whose family has been damaged through these actions and other forces, is sent to live with her grandparents on the coast, at which point her nonhuman relatives contrive to bring her and her family back to the home they once shared with other life forms.The little girl, Fiona, who is the primary human character, played by Jenny Courtney, is wonderfully written and played. She is not your standard cutie-pie, but a budding force of nature. It is obvious why of all the members of her family, the nonhumans single her out for their attention. The story is drawn from the traditional Irish and Scots stories of relationships between humans and seals, or selchies, but transposes this into a more modern setting, without losing any of the mystery or wonder.One of the strongest recommendations I can give this film is that has become one of the most popular and respected films at Haskell Indian Nations University here in Kansas. Indigenous Americans seem to identify with the experience of the Irish, which shows them that modern European culture has been destructive to Indigenous peoples in Europe, and allows them to realize that there have been and continue to be, Indigenous people with distinct cultures in Europe as well as the Americas. I was once in a video store, when a person I knew slightly asked me if I could recommend a film that would appeal both to him and his children. Without hesitation I went over and picked up the store's copy of Roan Inish, and told him, Not only will you enjoy this, but it will give you and your kids a lot to think and talk about.

The movie mainly focuses on ten-year-old Fiona going to live with her grandparents in Donegal, Ireland, and learning family stories. But there were two aspects that I found particularly important.One was the focus on how England sought to destroy the Irish culture. Students weren't allowed to speak their native language in school, and Fiona's grandparents have to give up their house to an English family. But there was also the focus on seals. Aside from the story about the woman who could turn into a seal, there's Fiona's disappeared younger brother might the seals be raising him? Rarely have I ever seen such a mystical and edifying look at the relationship between humans and animals.All in all, this is the sort of movie that could only come from John Sayles.

No one tells stories the way the Irish tell stories. This movie celebrates that gift and passion with story after story told within the frame of the film's story. The idea of the ultimate return home is given an even greater resonance than usual with a special reunion here. The whole notion of the loss of language, Gaelic in this instance, is universally moving and significant today. A wonderful story, gorgeously shot by Haskell Wexler, with beautiful music.

Based on the children's book, The Secret of Ron Mor Skerry by Rosalie K. Fry, The Secret of Roan Inish by John Sayles is about a family, a tradition, and a magical connection to the land. It is also the story of the island of Roan Inish where the Coneelly family lived in harmony with the seals for many generations until they left shortly after World War II. Brilliantly shot on location by the great Haskell Wexler, the film transports you into a world of black rocks, gloomy seascapes, squawking sea gulls, and seals that look human. The mood of solitude is enhanced by the tin whistle, flute, strings and bodhran (old style frame drum) of Mason Daring's enchanting score (I would have loved to also hear Selkie of Suleskerry and Rockin the Cradle).The film wonderfully recaptures the tradition of oral storytelling, especially by Fiona's grandfather who tells her stories about her ancestors with passion and conviction. The film depicts a version of the tale about the Selkie, the half-seal and half-human creatures that are regarded in Irish folklore as being able to transform themselves from seals into humans by casting off their skins. Her father's cousin Tadgh (John Lynch), one of the dark ones, tells Fiona how her ancestor Liam (Gerald Rooney) married a Selkie who was called Nuala (Susan Lynch), had children together, and lived happily for many years. Later when the children told Nuala where to find her sealskin, she left the family and returned to the sea. Fiona wonders if her baby brother Jamie (Cillian Byrne), lost at sea in his cradle during the evacuation, might still be alive under the protection of the Selkies on Roan Inish, waiting for the family to return. Fiona visits the island with her 13-year old cousin Eamon (Richard Sheridan) and, when she discovers footprints in the surf, begins a process of unraveling the truth of Jamie's disappearance. While I had problems with the internal logic of the story and some very stiff performances, The Secret of Roan Inish is a genuinely moving parable about preserving family tradition, being part of the natural world, and having the courage to seek the truth for yourself. The film can be recommended for older children, but keep in mind that the pace is slow and the car chases are kept to an absolute minimum.

Like all of these films (Waking Ned Devine, Far and Away, Riverdance etc), The Secret of Roan Inish exemplifies what writer Natasha Casey calls Cletic commodification, reducing Ireland and Irishness to Celtic myths, quaint, pre-modern, rural landscapes, and a depiction of the nation as being forever pre-colonised. Unsurprisingly, the film was widely distributed in America and Britian (since John Ford, Irishness has always been used as a vehicle to allow white audiences to role-play being white minorities/victims), but only had a limited release in Ireland. Its pastoral, regressive image of Irish society is more commercially viable outside of its home territory. The film is often touted as being Sayles' only non-political film, but this isn't true. Its tales of when man and beast lived side-by-side, sharing the sea, of monsters shedding their past skins, of a little girl's self determination and slow journey back to her roots, are designed specifically for the Irish diaspora. It's a call for a people to return to their homes and live alongside the now tamed beasts of Old England.Everyone wants to march into the future, one haggard Irish character says, mourning about how his country just got left behind. But the film's solution is to avoid modernization and to delve deeper into the past; a regression into some mythical pure origins, a move backward to re-establish a pre-colonial Ireland. This is not surprising. The grand narrative of a society moving from the pre-modern to the modern to the post-modern, breaks down in Ireland. After the Anglo-Irish and Civil wars, as well as hundreds of years of struggle, the Irish were concerned with maintaining the nationalist cultural identity that they were finally free to express in their self-governance. But what Sayles' film does is advocate delving into the rich identity of Ireland's past, whilst serving up only Disneyland trinkets. It's the condescending David Lean view of Ireland; the art house equivalent of a Lucky Charms cereal box. So it's not only that the film fails to give a genuine ideology of contemporary Ireland, or that it chooses an escape to the past instead of clarifying historical events, but that it pretends to be about identity when actually it's relying on mythology in order to avoid questions of authenticity (or the impossibility thereof). Ironically, with the Irish film industry in ruins, Irishness has increasingly become a sort of viscious circle, foreigners projecting Irishness onto a country who must now parrot (and export) such cosy, plastic Irishness in their own art if they hope to garner international attention. Sayles is unwittingly participating here in the kind of damaging, bottled-tourism and cultural kitsch that he denounces so well in Limbo and Sunshine State. Ignoring these issues, the film works fairly well as a children's fantasy, though I suspect most kids and adults will find Roan Inish too plain and too slow. Compare the film to Victor Erice's The Spirit of the Beehive, a masterpiece which, like Roan Inish, merges history, myth and childhood. 7/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

A little girl, Fiona, comes to live with her grandparents and learns of the legend of her ancestors and seals with mystical qualities.

Jeni Courtney is perfectly cast in the lead role and she effortlessly displays a natural ability to seem like a real ten year-old kid. Sayles lets her appear in virtually every scene of the movie and it is a wise choice. The sea and its creatures are the other major element and it all works to make The Secret Roan Inish worth a 7.5/10.

The seascapes are beautifully filmed and the extensive footage of the seals is endearing. Is there anyone with soul so dead who does not find seals adorable? One of the greatest values this movie had for me was Sayles' reference to Robert Flaherty's Man of Aran in his director's commentary. He said that he had watched that in preparing for the filming of Roan Inish. That put me on to watching Man of Aran, which I had never heard of.

Fiona's father has taken her to the city where the jobs are supposed to be better than the fishing life the family has always known. Unfortunately father spends most of his time drinking in the pub. A kindly bar maid suggests that he send her back to the Grandparents who could probably take better care of her. That's were the story really begins. Grandfather tells her the history of the Connelly's and Roan Inish. They are descended from a Selkie. A female seal that could shed her skin and sun herself on the rocks. If you steal her skin she will stay with you, and that's what the ancestor did. They had many children and lived happily until her eldest told her where the skin was hidden. The Selkie went back to the sea. Fiona's cousin Eamon has also run away from the city and come back to fish with his grandfather. The Grandmother thinks it's just a bunch of old tales.

From tales set in America's past (Matewan), to yuppy dramadies (The Return Of The Secaucus Seven), to urban social satires (The Brother From Another Planet), to more modern looks at American life (Sunshine State, Lone Star, Casa De Los Babys), Sayles has shown a desire to explore things no other filmmaker has. And while he does not have a distinctive look nor style, each of films is well wrought, and a worthy addition to world cinema. One of his most daring films was actually one of his most popular and financially successful- 1995's Irish fantasy film, The Secret Of Roan Inish.OK, let me rephrase- to call The Secret Of Roan Inish a fantasy film- even if Sayles adapted the screenplay from a 1957 children's book (The Secret Of Ron Mor Skerry) by Rosalie K. Fry, is to sell it short. It is a very sly and deep look at childhood and the loneliness that accompanies such. In this way, it is very much in league with such other explorations of early childhood loneliness as Val Lewton's 1944 film The Curse Of The Cat People and 1968's Godzilla's Revenge. It is also very much a great family film along the lines of October Sky and My Dog Skip.It is also very much a mythic film. That term is often overused to describe films that deal with 'epic' characters or situations, but that sort of description and film too often wallows in the pseudo-babble of faux intellectuals like Joseph Campbell. This film succeeds by using the exact opposite tack- it presents the film very much from a child's eye point of view, that of its lead character Fiona Coneely (Jeni Courtney)- a cute ten year old blond girl who goes to live with her grandparents after World War Two, because her mother has died, and her father has had to go off to Scotland to find work.The film did only mediocre at the box office, but that's because it is a terrific and deep film that never condescends. It is a children's film sans explosions and wiseass children, and explodes the idea that films aimed at children need be lesser versions of their adult counterparts. In fact, they have a greater charge- to appeal to kids as well as adults, and on both levels. Children's films, in fact, should have more ideas crammed into them as children can absorb more and learn from them without the biases and fears that a typical adult has acquired.The film runs a crisp hour and forty-three minutes, and not a second is wasted. The only quibble one might have with the film is its title. It really should have been called The Secrets (plural) Of Roan Inish, for more than the secret of Jamie's fate is involved. Yet, the flaws in this film are very minor- such as Fiona's repeated inability to outwit her wild child brother, compared to the film's virtues- almost all else. The Secret Of Roan Inish is one of Sayles' best films, and arguably a great film in its own right. That this film did what it did with so little shows that true creativity thrives no matter what its source of nourishment is, and that when that creativity is a product of John Sayles' mind, it's likely to be something well beyond the norm.

The problem isn't the central performance of Jeni Courtney as Fiona, which is outstandingly good, or the rest of the cast who must have frozen their assets impressively filming the lives of poor fishermen on the East Atlantic foreshore. More power to them. The kid playing the lost boy Jamie, Cillian Byrne (who didn't trouble the costume department), is also amazing, the way he (apparently) steers that floating cradle; and the scene with the seal and him having 'tea' is tremendous. But essentially this is a children's film, a sort of 'Railway Children' with Irish pipes and seals. Lots of Irish pipes. Lots of seals. Lots of seagulls. Lots of cold-looking water and rowboats. Lots of beaches, grass and flowers. Yet more Irish music. The only real suspense is whether there's a happy ending or not, which I won't give away, but no-one ever doubts that Fiona's story of what she has seen is true. Fair enough, they're simple people who believe in faery folk, but it all seems a bit cut-and-dried in the end. At the beginning, there's too much exposition from blarney-gushing Oirish characters, the late middle segue sequence goes on a bit too long and the pacing tends to slow up towards the end. But it's a genuine, well-made, innocent sort of film that you can safely let your smallest kids watch. The sort of film to rent at Xmas, or Easter. Especially if there's any Irish in you, or you particularly like seals. Much better than 'Ryan's Daughter', btw.

This is not the stereotypical American view of an Ireland possessed by banshees and leprechauns. This film is a beautiful adaptation of a legend that is not too widely spread. The story reveals the legend of the Selkie--the fairy creatures who were half human, half seal. It is an old tale, probably originally out of Scotland and coming into Ireland through County Donegal, which is also the setting of this movie. The actors are mostly unknown to American audiences but their performances are wonderful. The music is all traditional Irish folksong, and you'll hear a bit of the old language (Irish Gaelic) in the film as well. This movie is perfect for all of us Irish and Scots transplants and emigrants' children who are or want to be in touch with our roots. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking, and it'll make you want to move home in a hurry. The story might be a tad difficult to follow unless you concentrate, and unless you have an ear for the dialect, I'd suggest leaving the closed captioning on the first time you view it, as the Donegal Irish speech is not an easy one to decipher at first. Once you get past those small hurdles, however, you will find yourself in possession of a true gem of a film that treats a wonderful old legend with the respect and wonder it deserves. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in their Irish stock. "},{"Title":"Just see it.  Preferably in a theatre.","Date":"13 August 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  I heard the best review for this movie that I've ever heard for ANY movie. It went something like I would happily tell any friend, 'Go see this movie, then let's sit down together, have a drink of something warm, and we'll talk.' That was the whole review.  Simple, unqualified approval. I'd never before gone into a movie with such high expectations without being disappointed. Ten out of ten.  This show is in my top twenty favourites.

Master Sayles presents the viewer with a tale of changing the conditions of rural communities as they become part of the global village, with a spry hand. This film is as accessible for 30-something intellectuals as it is for 10-something children.

Shocked by this I filled out the required information just to write this one review. This film struck me as borderline unwatchable. The child acting is on par The Phantom Menace. The little girl is cute, but good lord it was just embarrassing to watch. I kept telling myself it had to be intended as a children's movie and I was being unfair to assess it as harshly as I was until the movie had been playing for about an hour and NOTHING HAD HAPPENED! The only event that had occurred, excluding the painfully boring exposition, was the little girl chasing the naked kid for 40 seconds or so only to lose him in his little boat. I kept holding on hoping something, anything, would happen, but it never really did. This is literally how the movie ends The little girl's family , for no reason, starts believing her about the little boy so they go out in the storm to find him. They walk outside their newly repaired house and the girl yells Look! We then see the kid on the shore and when he sees his sister he tries to flee, perhaps horrified at his sister's acting ability. When he tries to get in his little boat some seals, bear with me, come onto the shore. One seal chases him away from his boat and the others push the boat into the water. The family captures him and that's the happy ending? Does that not seem, at best, extremely dumb to anyone else? I can maybe buy someone liking the cultural overtones of the movie or even the occasional whimsy, but who in their right mind could truly say that they were ENTERTAINED by this film? Maybe this movie just went over my head, but in order for me to enjoy a movie i would need a few events to occur and maybe a plot or something.

I'm a Sayles fan, but this film was terribly dull most of the time - I think I fell asleep while watching it.  The first 1/3 of the film's narrative was difficult to follow, and only in the last 20 minutes or so did the film manage to sustain my interest.  Roan Innish is my least favorite John Sayles effort, though I haven't seen his early 80's films since they came out.
