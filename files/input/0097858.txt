It's about a bunch of animal puppets (or people in animal costumes) putting on a show where everything goes wrong. Half of the puppets are strung out on drugs; some are doing porno videos in the basement; the rabbit is basically getting it on with everybody (and gets a potentially fatal disease); a walrus is going at it with a cat (this is shown) and a psychotic hippo gets hold of a machine gun....As you can see this is NOT for the kiddies. What it is is an all out, no holds barred assault on good taste. Jackson and his crew show puppets vomiting, having sex, being graphically killed or sexually assaulted. If you have a weak stomach this is NOT for you. However if you have a REAL sick sense of humor and can take VERY graphic material (like me) you'll have a ball! I was actually laughing myself silly during this. The movie keeps topping itself with the humor getting more sick and graphic until the final massacre sequence at the end. Hard to believe this guy went on to do The Lord of the Rings trilogy. NOT FOR EVERYBODY but damn I had so much FUN watching it!!!!

It's an ultra-perverse, ultra-absurd, and sometimes really ultra-stupid take on a variety show where puppets are preparing for the night's performance, only everything that could go wrong- or more precisely anything that could be unexpected to go wrong- does every which way to Sunday. It's actually the kind of movie when I was watching, for the most part early on, I almost couldn't really laugh. I just had a look on my face like 'what am I watching?' And, 'how can something like this actually exist?' It's not even so much a question of how well or how not well Jackson and his low-budget team pull it off, but how someone can take the time and energy to think this all up and put it all on paper.Let me try to sort through some of the varied story lines- there is Robert, a newcomer to the Feebles gang (and gang I mean in literal and figurative terms), who wants to impress a certain poodle-dog type of girl who really has him going to lengths to impress her. But meanwhile, a really nasty rodent- also a porno director as well as the boss's assistant- decides to use her in his next porno flick by drugging her. This rodent also has to deal with some other low-lifes in the group, like a junkie lizard who has one big story to tell Robert at one point about his crazy, violent trip to Vietnam (including a 'why not' homage to Deer Hunter). There's also a rabbit who may or may not be dying from an STD of some sort (I think it was an STD anyway), and has a pestering fly (always in the most uncomfortably close of close-ups) trying to get the scoop on his condition. There's even the overly-annoying stage manager who can't wait to put on his God-awful dance number of his own. But the main center of attention and star of the Feebles shows is Heidi, a hippo who loves to binge on junk food, and is also suspecting a femme-feline of stealing away her previous man- the boss. When she finds out what's really up, it leads to the unbelievable climax.And so on. I still keep thinking about my reactions to certain scenes, and the kind of sensibility about this whole project. Maybe in part its really lampooning something maybe more common in New Zealand, like with whatever kinds of variety shows or kid shows they have there. But it's also without a doubt that Jackson's also seen his share of Muppets, as the basic concept follows off from the Muppet Show. What's amazing about the film, and at times a little frustrating, is how a real mind-set of gonzo film-making is apparent. It doesn't seem original in parts, like it's taking things from other movies- or maybe other movies and shows that have come after this seem quite similar- but it really is in the bizarre, crude nature of everything. The climax probably holds the biggest laughs and surprises, even in its tight context of everything going to hell in a hand-basket. As its a world entire devoid of humans, all of its logic is based around how outrageous these puppets can be in their own whacked-out environment. With the exception of the naive, method-trained Robert, and maybe his love interest, every character in the picture is severely flawed in one way or another, or just really put to abstract lengths so mind-boggling they work only in conjunction with Jackson's unnerving, low-budget style. It has the same jarring, diabolically juvenile and in-your-face comedy of some of the South Park guys stuff (Team America and Cannibal sort of come to mind), but without necessarily the sharp edge of satire.And at the end of it all, with all the laughs I had and shocked 'huh' moments at what Jackson had done with all these weird characters (some of which are outright perverts, drug addicts, criminals, egoists, adulterers, and even father half elephant-half chicken offspring), I wasn't sure totally what the point of it all was. Maybe though there really isn't any; I have to think this is the kind of movie that a director makes with himself as the audience, and not really in a selfish manner either. It's not great art by any means, and doesn't pretend to be, which is part of the dark fun of it all Meet the Feebles, with its singing and dancing miscreants (quite a catchy theme song by the way), and numerous scenes of more-than-suggestive sexual moments and gory bouts of extreme violence, is a case of kamikaze independent film-making, where homage spreads out into the concept and becomes something very strange but, in its own world, sort of wonderful too. It might be far from my favorite of the director's, but it's got things in it that are really fantastic and uproarious. It's one of those fine guilty pleasures of the late 80s.

Maybe it is best described as Bad Taste with puppets or The Muppet Movie in bad taste but it is certainly a movie I would recomend to anyone of sufficient maturity (no children should EVER see this film).Like Bad Taste before it this movie features disgusting humour, lots of blood, and impressive low budget special effects, and the puppets in it have to be seen to be believed.  One of the best things about The Fellowship of the Ring (and I Love that movie as well) is that in the hype following it more people may see Meet The Feebles.  Maybe Meet The Feebles and Bad Taste will be released on DVD in Australia now (I have them both on VHS).I will say one thing tho, it is certainly a strange feeling to have been a Peter Jackson fan for 10 years before Lord Of The Rings was released and the whole world finally discovered him.

Back then, this was the most cruel, disgusting thing I had ever seen and it sent me into shock.Now, at the ripe old age of eighteen, I can proudly say, this is the movie that made me the twisted monkey I am today.The film itself was done by the same guy who directed the infamously long Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson. You wouldn't guess it by the budget, but that doesn't remove any enjoyment. The film reeks of genius, taking something very fun and family friendly (The Muppets, and any other puppet-based kids show) and adding some not-so-family-safe elements (drugs, sex, killing, STDs, blackmail, date-rape, porn, swearing, toilet humour, homosexuality, eating disorders, emotional instability, smoking, suicide and excessive amounts of blood).But how does it add up? Well, quite honestly I think this movie is one of the best pieces of satire ever created. Having seen a fair few puppet shows, it never crossed my mind about what Kermit would be like as a drug addicted ex-Vietnam veteran, or if the rest of the crew went bad. And Peter Jackson brings out the depravity greatly, with most of the movie being filmed in a cramped back-stage area that is covered in filth.I would recommend this to anybody who has a very wicked sense of humour, since this has quite possibly destroyed more than a few childhoods. It definitely ruined mine, and I certainly would say adults only. Only show it to your children if you're sick in the head, or if you hate them.

It's unlike any movie I've ever seen before, but it does work. Let me alert you though, if your viewing history with Peter Jackson doesn't go past Lord Of The Rings and King Kong then you may want to think twice before watching Jackson's earlier films, because I'll say it loud it clear Meet The Feebles may very well be the most repulsing movie I've ever seen. It may not be as gory as Braindead, Jackson's own zombie gore-fest masterpiece, but it is more sickening. It's hard to describe it because it defies every convention ever created, but it is gross. However, if you can tolerate the gross and obscene and find humor in black comedies, then Meet The Feebles is sure to amaze you. The film follows a troupe of performing puppets called The Feebles who present a variety show of sorts. Throughout the film we experience a whole abundance of problems with the cast. I don't want to spoil anything about the movie because I feel it is the most effective if the viewer has no clue but they're getting into, but I recommend to go into the movie naively, making everything you see all the more shocking, and in effect, all the more hilarious. And yet again without spoiling, the film's final scene is a force to be reckoned with. It manages to be one of the most striking closing sequences in any movie, capping off the unique movie. Peter Jackson like few other filmmakers has a knack for creating films that are unique and original in their own respect every time. From the splatter fest of Braindead to the epic proportions of Lord Of The Rings to the haunting, sickening and hilarious tones of Meet The Feebles, Jackson is the real deal in film making. But take this as your final warning folks, Meet The Feebles is not for the weak of stomach.

That's the first thing which comes into mind after watching the movie. Second thing is, that visually MTF is probably the poorest movie by Peter Jackson, even his first film, Badtaste, had better camera work. But the difference might come from the fact, that the movie is puppet/people in animal suit film.The film starts with a quick Feebels opening musical act, then we meet Robert, a hedgehog who has just about to begun his career with the Feebels. Bletch, a manager of the Feebels, does his side business, drug smuggling, while trying to achieve syndicated TV series of Feebels. Trevor the rat does hardcore porno while dealing drugs to the cast members. The list goes on and on. MTF isn't Peter Jackson best, or funniest film. It's far away from his two other gore and black humor spreading movies, Brain Dead and Badtaste. It's not bad movie tough, if you can stand juvenile South Park humor, and it does have couple of rather good scenes cinematically. But other than that the plot is a bit too loose and the film reminds a lot a sketch type TV show than a real movie.

How could you, when it deals with drugs, sex, vomit, AIDS, Vietnam, and bloody massacres? And when all of the above is done by MUPPETS? (Actually not official Muppets, but it's clear that some of the characters - especially the female hippo - got inspiration from some of the actual Muppets.)It's a sick movie, but actually it's also very funny. Peter Jackson is obviously one of the masters of cinematic sick humor. Though Meet The Feebles in now way compares to Dead-Alive, it's still worth checking out for any Jackson fans.Still, I had some complaints about the movie(1) The movie didn't have a high enough budget, making some sequences look TOO cheesy(2) An obnoxious music score(3) A musical score that doesn't know when to shut up(4) Too many characters(5) No characters get enough time to actually make them main charactersIt's possible that even if you are a Jackson fan, you might be disappointed with the movie. I admit the five problems I've listed above almost got to the point where I wouldn't recommend the movie. But in the end, I was glad to have seen it. If you prepare yourself for this movie having some major problems, and you are not expecting a masterpiece like Jackson's Dead-Alive, then by all means see Meet The Feebles.

I mean, the idea is just pretty good making kinda of a drama/black comedy story about what happens behind a big, famous, theater musical... What, you thought I'm talking about Birdman now? No, this is totally different. This whole thing is made with puppets. And not Henson's puppets. They can be as cute as creepy, as funny as kinky, as wise as dirty. I don't know.

And it has some characters that are good, still trying to do the right thing, while in Birdman we have a big bunch of crazy selfish actors trying to do everything for anything.Of course, it is a MUST WATCH only if you are into B movies, 80's movies, cult classics or whatever...

Well other than the fact that they are all high quality films, they all share a director with the little seen; little loved 1989 New Zealand film Meet the Feebles (1989). That's right; before Peter Jackson won critical acclaim for his magnificent spectacles and J.R.R. Tolkien adaptations he was the director of a twisted, tawdry parody of The Muppets (1976-1981), ranking up there with The Toxic Avenger (1984) in its level of vulgarity.The movie aptly juggles a multitude of stories surrounding the struggling variety show cast and crew. The main character of Meet the Feebles is an aging star, Heidi the Hippo (Danny Mulheron) who is struggling to keep her relationship with adulterous producer Bletch the Walrus (Peter Vere-Jones). That, in addition to a sugary sweet love story between a hedgehog and a poodle is about the tamest thing about Meet the Feebles. There are subplots involving drugs, STDs, Vietnam flashbacks, gun violence and plenty of puppet sex.The sheer ridiculousness of this nightmarish puppet show makes it too ghastly to look away. It appalls intrigues and impresses in equal measure. Everything from the camera-work to the puppeteering to the script are crude yet wildly effective. The size of each anamorphic puppet varies from elaborate sock puppet to a multi-crewed giant all requiring a certain level of skill which while not on par with Jim Henson, is fun to watch.This film, coupled with Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (1992) makes me wonder where the director would be if he had stayed on the path of grotesque horror and gallows humor. Give the man a humungous budget, award winning actors and the top technical talents of Hollywood, and he'll give you a triptych of timeless classics. Give him just $750,000 a hand-held camera and some felt and he'll give you a memorable marionette experience that won't be equaled until Team America World Police (2004). One thing's for certain if he had stayed on the path we wouldn't have had to endure The Frighteners (1996).The script written by Jackson and three other New Zealanders is fresh and funny giving the audience everything from silly muppet-like puns to ribald musical numbers including Sodomy sung by Sebastian the Fox (Stuart Devenie). Much of the gross out humor is provided by a character simply known as The Fly (Brian Sergent) who buzzes around for tabloid gossip and develops his photos in a toilet.The rest of the film is filled to the brim with knife throwing, machine gun toting; cocaine sniffing mayhem intermingled with rabbit-HIV and sadomasochism for good measure. I'd recommend this film to anyone with a warped sense of humor over a certain age. Those who were endeared by Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear and Gonzo the&#x85;whatever, should probably avoid Meet the Feebles. Not because of its cynical treatment of hand puppets might ruin fond memories but because those same fond memories might be replaced by rude hilarity that ensues in Peter Jackson's 8th best film.http//www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Another fim in bad taste, but in this case, a good thing","Date":"3 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Musical","Review":" What a bizarre flick this is. Borderline porn, reversely different from Jackson's Bad Taste, this almost seems appropriate, one factor I loved about this. Set around this t.v. show where some of the puppets are really bad and devious sorts, most of the characters in Showgirls should get together with them. Everything and anything shocking comes up in this, including gore, some puppet porn, plus a fly feeding on faecies. Certainly something different, this PJ flick only had a couple of special screenings back in 91 at the Academy, and really I guess it deserved more. Definitely an improvement on his horrible but undeniably lovable dreck, Bad Taste, this captivates the viewer by how far these puppets go. Like Ted, the puppets here were well manned, some of them actually cute and likable like Robert the slightly stuttering hedge hog, and his bitch on heat, this white female poodle, Lucille, oblivious to the fact, she's about to become a star in this scuzzy rat's underground sex flick. Heidi the hippo, the star of our show, goes nuts in the end, guns blazing, at the discovery of her husband, Harry the Walrus, having it off with a southern bell speaking floosy. If you liked to be really shocked, deeply humored, or after something different, where the coin could toss both ways, give this one a go. Besides Robert, I really did love Heidi, especially eating out a bakery. I wish Peter Jackson still made these offbeat kind of films. "},{"Title":"Juvenile, but undeniably funny and twisted","Date":"21 April 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Musical","Review":" After his bad taste dÃ©but, er, Bad Taste (1987), the young Peter Jackson made the decision to take his filth-laden sense of humour to a new level and direct Meet the Feebles, the kind of film you would expect Jim Henson to make if his life had gone in an entirely different direction and had formed a psychedelic drug habit. He still had little budget to work with, as well as the (understandable) concerns from his funders, but this was the first time he would work with his future wife Fran Walsh, who would work with him on every film after this. Maybe it is her influence that makes Feebles a noticeable step up from his dÃ©but, or maybe it's not, but the film works thanks to a director seemingly more comfortable in his role, but still renegade enough to inject his guerilla sensibilities into it.The basic 'plot' revolves around The Feebles variety show, of which the main attraction is singer Heidi the Hippo (voiced by Mark Hadlow, Dori in The Hobbit (2012)), a former big star who has formed an uncontrollable attraction to cakes. Amongst the various characters is newcomer Robert, a softly-spoken and naive hedgehog who goes to great lengths to attract a seductive poodle he has fallen for. It is mainly through his eyes that we witness the mayhem of the show, which is ran by Bletch the Walrus (Peter Vere-Jones). Bletch is involved with Heidi, but is secretly having sex with a slutty feline, and is always making money on the side through Trevor the Rat's (Brian Sergent) pornography films. The show comes under threat when sex-addicted Harry the Rabbit contracts an STD and is given a few hours to live, but is busted by the Fly, a pesky journalist.What Meet the Feebles lacks in taste and any sense of actual purpose, it makes up for in sheer invention and entertainment. It moves along furiously, never stopping to consider something as unnecessary as plot, drifting from one scene of complete debauchery to the next. If you would be offended by the sight of animal ejaculating through his elongated snout onto the the pierced udders of a dominatrix cow, then I would recommending passing on this one. The humour is almost akin to that of South Park, but doesn't bogged down with satire or observational gags, and instead seems to seek to disgust. It is juvenile, certainly, but it's undeniably funny, and is simply too twisted and disturbing to go about unnoticed. It is the anti-Muppets, representing depravity where Henson's creations were driven by naive optimism (although the puppets here are quite wonderfully designed).After the proceeding Braindead (1992), which employed a lawnmower as the answer to a house overrun by horny zombies, Jackson seemed to grow up and film the astonishingly dream-like Beautiful Creatures (1994). It is simply mind-boggling how the director of this, a film that has a contortionist get his head stuck up his own a**e, would go on to be the biggest director in Hollywood and create one of the finest achievements of modern mainstream film-making, The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003). Although he never won any Oscars for them, there is plenty to enjoy in early Jackson. You could even say that some of the hideous creations in Feebles were a pretext to some of the monsters seen in Rings and The Hobbit.

These characters are cast and crew of a variety show with more than its fair share of behind the scenes tumult. The star hippo is completely stressed out, the frog knife thrower (a Vietnam veteran) is a hopeless drug addict, and the rabbit MC believes himself to be dying of a venereal disease. In this wonderfully warped vision that co-writer / co-producer / director Jackson creates, puppets have sex, defecate, swear, vomit, and gruesomely slaughter each other. Yup, this is far from being appropriate for kids, but that's the whole point, and one is compelled to keep watching this deliciously dark comedy just to see what nastiness Jackson and company will come up with next. First rate puppeteering, truly fun puppet design, enthusiastic vocal performances, and genuinely catchy songs are part of the package in this priceless puppet perversion. The characters are entertaining, too, whether they're endearing (such as well intentioned nice guy Wobert the Hedgehog) or just plain despicable (Trevor the Rat, who indeed is every bit the walking and talking vermin). The movie is a marvel in terms of art direction and spectacle. One of the gut busting highlights has the flustered, in-over-his-head director fox staging his own production number where he pays tribute to sodomy. Jackson just dives headfirst into the mayhem, leaving all of the credits for the end, and does a fun job of skewering show business in general, with the appropriate casting of a fly as a stereotypically sleazy journalist set on exposing the hapless rabbit's secret. And the jokes keep coming when we get an update on the surviving characters before the end credits begin. If the prospective viewer really enjoyed Dead Alive and Bad Taste, they should find this adequately amusing as well. Eight out of 10.

Ultra violence and low budget, while still remaining watchable often times can lead to a cult, and this is no different. This is a bizarre film that shows the weakness in characters, such as drug addiction, sex addiction, STDs and more. The problem is, this movie focuses on over 10 different characters, each with their own sub-plot, so we never get a main plot. It's just a series of stories on puppets working on a show, and how they live their lives.Meet the Feebles is a popular show, starring an eclectic group of animals that sing and dance an perform amusing numbers. Backstage, things are completely different. Arguably, the main plot is that of Robert the Hedgehog, who is the newest Feeble. He is trying to woo Lucille, a chorus girl poodle. Other plots include Heidi the hippo whose lover and manager is cheating on her for Samantha the cat. This sends her in an eating rage, and later a violent rage. Sebastion the fox, the group's gay choreographer is trying to get a number in on the show, but it isn't until the stage goes into complete chaos that he gets it in. Trevor the rat, the manager of the manager, drugs and rapes Lucille. Harry the rabbit believes he's contracted a deadly STD. And many other sub-plots...This movie has no focus, and the constant switch of characters can grow tiring. There's a lot of gross out humor to appeal to those who enjoy puppet violence/sex, but it only comes in spurts, so don't expect a constant bloody puppet orgy. The Robert the hedgehog story brings a small bit of heart to the movie, but at the same time, it's just not very interesting. None of the plots are particularly interesting, except for Heidi's final performance backstage. It's the characters that make this watchable. There's so many and so many jokes being fired, and about a quarter of them are funny, and the rest you just shrug off.With all that said, this isn't a bad movie. It's just a very disjointed film. It is amusing mostly, and occasionally it's really funny, but you may find for some of the film you'll be closing your eyes thinking about pudding (or something other than the movie in front of you).My rating ** 1/2 out of ****. 97 mins.

Meanwhile, a sexually active rabbit named Harry discovers that he has a deadly sexually transmitted disease, let's just say that it's AIDS, and only has a matter of hours before he dies. He doesn't want to disappoint his fans, however, and doesn't tell anybody, but a fly reporter knows his secret and is going to tell the press and destroy poor Harry. Meanwhile, a new cast member hedgehog named Robert has joined the Feebles and has fallen in love with a beautiful poodle singer. He is joined with a worm who helps him impress her and fall in love with him, but Trevor the Rat wants a new actress for his porno films and has set his sights on Robert's new lover. Meanwhile, a gay fox named Sebastien is nerve racked by the fact that he wants the show to go perfect and is determined to entertain people, even if that means making a stoned Vietnam war veteran throw knives on stage, and do a musical number that he created himself that apparently is not family friendly enough according to Bletch, the Head Master of the show. Out of all of Peter Jackson's pre-Lord of the Rings films,(This, BAD TASTE, BRAINDEAD, HEAVENLY CREATURES, FORGOTTEN SILVER, and THE FRIGHTENERS) This would have to be my favorite of his. Not that I don't love the rest of them, but this film has something very special. It has scenes of true human anguish and frustration. It is honest in it's plot lines. It is very funny, witty, and intelligent. And it has characters that you love and care about, despite all the nastiness. If I were to compare this film to another, I'd probably compare it to Paul Thomas Anderson brilliant film, MAGNOLIA, for it's intersecting story lines and stressed out characters. And yet this film offers so much else. This film shows us characters that, to their audience are fun and talented, but backstage are deeply flawed and very disturbed characters. All of the characters turmoils build up to a gore fest finale in which a character goes on a killing spree. The mass murder is an event that shook the puppet world, and yet the viewer won't be surprised by it since one of the characters had to lose it at some point. This film also gives us character development and key plot points that go past being comic events and somehow become all part of a payoff. The film, in actuality, is an emotional roller coaster ride, much like a lot of serious films. There are some Vietnam war flashbacks of the drug addicted frog character that are actually quite terrifying and intense when it stops being funny. The scenes with Heidi growing depressed are quite sad and moving. The scenes of the rabbit dying of AIDS are difficult to watch and give a more honest representation of that reality than most, if not all, movies would feel comfortable giving. It's a vile film is some respects, but I adored it and am proud to own it, even if the DVD has no special features on it whatsoever(unless you count a chapter menu, which I don't). I highly recommend it. It's a great film.

I looked at it as a meaningful, profoundly symbolic work of his. Excellent job. I would have my kids watch it when they turn 18. The acting is exquisite and amazingly done by a hippo with a machine gun, an untrustworthy walrus, a naive porcupine, sick bunnies, etc. I can totally see the connections between this movie and his later ones, even though they are done on different budget.

He basically just took the real entertainment industry and put it in puppet form. Sex, Lies, and a hippo with a machine gun. Okay, maybe it wasn't an uncanny depiction of the basic industry. But it had its moments. It also had me wondering... Did he really mean this to make it a comedy. I mean if it wasn't with puppets it wouldn't be funny at all. But, It would be entertaining nonetheless. Unlike most Jackson movies, it was mostly raunchy over gory. My family was kind of cynical when I bought this movie. They have seen the new Jackson movies and just didn't know what to expect from this. But they were pleasantly surprised. Altogether I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I recommend it to anyone whole likes Gore, puppets, Peter Jackson, and Hippos.

Unfortunately this film seems to be unfairly treated as a juvenile attempt at shock value or gross-out comedy, with most critics completely ignoring the satire. Kubrick made how many films prominently featuring satire and the grotesque? Easily we could look at just A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket and ask are those films juvenile gross out comedies? No, those films are classic statements about the direction that humanity is heading, and so is Meet the Feebles. Peter Jackson took a Muppets-ish satire and made an allegory about the ills of Hollywood and excess in the entertainment industry. Jackson tackles not only the ills of the entertainment industry, but also the ills in general of living in our modern society where people are used as commodities in every facet of life. That he accomplished such sharp criticism using a Muppets-esquire parody is an amazing accomplishment, and for that he deserves a place alongside other satiric luminaries like Kubrick and Vonnegut. My only complaint is that Jackson hasn't made more films in this tone, and instead went on to direct an epic stack of boredom after this.For an underground film fan, this one of the better (non-campy) things to come out of the 80's. Peter Jackson my hats off to you. I don't quite understand how someone can go from this movie and Bad Taste to the blockbuster Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the epic proportions of LOTR are somewhat foreshadowed here. Do yourself a favor, rent the Feebles on VHS so you get all the grimy gritty texture that the film's subjects deserve. If they ever re-release this film I just hope they do a promotional tie-in with stuffed animals of the characters, specifically Wubot (Robert). He has worked his way into my heart, the lovable lil fella.

Peter Jackson has since shown that he is an elite filmmaker and his films like this one are where it began. Films such as Bad Taste and dead-alive are awesome films.

This film centers around a Muppets like variety hour that is going to go on live TV. Things really start going awry (where to begin) before their scheduled performance. Heidi the Hippo is slowly learning that her man, Bletch the Walrus (also the show's producer), is banging Samantha the Cat. To add to this, Wynnyard the Forg is hopelessly addicted to heroin after his tour in Vietnam (nice little Nam flashback scene) and can't perform his knife throwing routine without his fix. Harry the Hare thinks he got AIDS from sleeping with one or more of his bunny groupies. Trevor the Rat is just an all around asshole who makes porno tapes in the basement using a cow and cockroach. On top of all of this, there's Robert the Hedgehog who has a crush on Lucile (I think she's a poodle) and is trying to win her affections (they're some of the only nice people in the movie).The whole show is a disaster from beginning to end, culminating in Sebastian the Fox singing a song about anal sex and Heidi going crazy with an M-60.I highly recommend it for those with a very twisted sense of humor.

The songs are all great, the puppets all look great, and just a fabulous story. This was an early indication of Peter Jackson's talent as a director.

But more than a skewering of the beloved children's puppets, this is the story of love, both blossoming and whithering, fame, madness and violence.The ensemble cast of puppets, called the Feebles, includes the star, Heidi the Hippo.  Heidi's best years are falling behind her.  Her boyfriend, the show's producer Bletch the Walrus, is cheating on her with a cat named Samantha.  She's depressed and stressed out on the eve of a major show the Feebles are performing, as is the director, Sebastion the Fox. And with good reason, just look at the rest of the cast  The rabbit MC has a venereal disease, the rat who's making porno films in the basement between a cow and a cockroach is also in charge of Bletch's shady drug deals, the knife-throwing frog is addicted to heroin and suffers from Nam flashbacks, the animal-trainer elephant is trapped in a paternity suit with a chicken, and to top it all off, Heidi's mental condition is rapidly deteriorating. Contrasting all these shady, unpleasant characters is the stalwart hedgehog Robert, the chain-smoking caterpillar Arthur and the beautiful poodle Lucille. I admired this film on an asthetic level.  For such an obviously low-budget film, the puppets are well crafted and well controlled.  The voice acting is stellar, there are some great songs, and when things start turning bad, the film has style to burn.  The script is sharp and observant, with some cutting satire perfectly balanced with some hilarious poo-poo humor.  But I can't say that I quite liked it, because that would imply that I had fun watching it.  I didn't.  It's very dark, very ugly, and very unpleasant. It's impact is a lasting one.

They are the Feebles and if you are willing to give them a mere hour and a half of your time they will take you on a ride so wild and over-the-top you may never see something like this in any other film. Anyone who is offended by Peter Jackson's second in what I like to call his trilogy of gore, should have know better in the first place. Only Jackson could make a film this ridiculous and get away with it. For everyone who has not heard of this film before let me give you the low day. We are presented with an all star cast of a hippo, a rat, a worm, a hedgehog, a seal, a warthog and a bull dog to name a few. The thing about this film that makes Jackson such a genius is that even though there is not a human in sight he still manages to have a more diverse cast than any film could dream of having and even though there is not one thing that happens in this film that should be taken seriously I felt myself becoming more attached to these puppets than most human actors. The film opens with a song and dance number that sums everything up Meet the Feebles, Meet the Feebles, we're not your average people They may not be average but all exhibit very human like behaviour that most people would probably not associate with puppets. Just in case you have not figured it out yet this film is not your average Muppet spin-off and should, under no circumstances be viewed by children, or most adults for that matter, anyone who thought Death to Smoochy was offensive better watch out because this film makes that looks like a Sunday matinee. We see a Hippo with a machine gun, a rat who directs porno, a warthog who sells cocaine, a rabbit who came down with HIV. from not using protection while having a threesome and a seal who receives oral sex from a rat who dresses like she is straight off the nearest corner, and all of it is nothing short of hilarious. There are many funny scenes to be had but one of the more enjoyable are of a burnt out lizard remembering his days in Vietnam, there is even a parody of the Russian roulette scenes from the Deer Hunter. The story behind the film is simple, it is one day in which all the performers must practice for a live broadcast of The Fabulous Feebles Variety Hour, but everything seems to be going wrong. Even though there is basically no plot to be found it is still pretty darn fun watching these puppets up to no good, getting into all kinds or hilarious and disgusting situations. All you hardcore Jackson fans fear not there are still plenty of liquids flying around including blood, vomit, urine, semen and puss. Jackson could have taken a satirical approach to this film and in some ways he did, but overall anything smart is thrown out the window in the name of good fun, and good fun it is. So instead he made a film that would please the fans of his other sick and twisted efforts such as Bad Taste and Dead/Alive. It is sad that we will probably never see films like this again since Jackson has sold his soul for mainstream success with Lord of the Rings, but nevertheless this is an underrated classic and if you have a sick sense of humour like me be sure to check this out because it is indeed one of a kind.

Meet The Feebles was no mere puppet movie, the artistic and comedy stylings of director Peter Jackson coupled with fantastic dialogue and story-lines made for a nonstop ride of laughter, bewilderment and humorous shock; especially at the amount of profanity and puppet sex.With an overweight psychopathic hippo, a bumbling shy hedgehog, a porn directing Rat, a crack addict frog and a devious drug baron producer - how could this not be funny?  To be fair it's a rip-off of certain Muppets movies but that does not take away the cutting edge that there is actually a story to the film and not just a moronic rip-off or snipe at other films. It has no need for expensive SFX as it uses whit and style to portray a message that puppet movies don't have to be the bane of a movie-lover, just a part of a person which never grew up.To think Peter Jackson went on to direct the Lord of The Rings films is a testament to his abilities to sling together a slapstick comedy like this which keeps you laughing and giggling throughout to a sensible and downright amazing film such as LOTR.

Well it's a hysterical/rotten little film that was spawned by film maker Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring). It's quite simply one of the funniest, dirtiest, and most unique film ever made. It's Meet the Feebles. To imagine what Meet the Feebles is, simply take the world of the Muppets, with a spice of Fraggle Rock, and then add a good hard helping of pornography and death, and you'll have Meet the Feebles.I don't adore the film just for its shock value, I adore it because it's an absolute joy to watch from start to finish. So before I get into the icky stuff, let's talk about what else makes Meet the Feebles a wonderful piece of cinema. Few films adore their characters in the same fashion as Meet the Feebles. In that respect, the admiration for its characters could be compared to Robert Altman's Short Cuts and P.T. Anderson's Magnolia. Although the characters are adored, it doesn't give them Walt Disney like immortality. This film is for the adults, with adult consequences, and no matter how adorable the Feebles are, they are not immortal. I guess part of the charm of Meet the Feebles is how the film makers take a topic (talking puppets) that would usually be intended for small children,and they go out and make it as extreme as possible. I admire that.The story is simple enough -- as it should be. Robert the hedgehog wants nothing more than to join the wonderful cast that is the Feebles. The Feebles are a group of actors and performers who work for a walrus named Bletch. Bletch is the big bad boss who has a rat named Trevor working for him. Trevor smuggles drugs to the Feebles, and has a frog who is a Vietnam veteran eating out of his hands. Trevor is also trying to get Robert's love interest into porn films. There's a rabbit who has a sexually transmitted disease, a fly who works for the Enquirer, a anteater who ejaculates from his nose, and a slew of other odd-ball characters. It's the characters that make this film, not the plot. Stuff to watch for 3minutes13seconds A walrus and a cat have hot passionate sex together. The walrus is upset because he didn't get to pop his cookies.16minutes38seconds Strange little fluffy critters tear up an elephant's bathroom. The money shot is one of the little buggers urinates into the sink. After the elephant throws them out of the bathroom, a large barrel runs them over and squishes them, and Trevor the rat eats some of the squished innards. 25minutes27seconds Harry the Rabbit has a three-way with two other rabbits. As the bunnies copulate, a horny anteater watches, and it appears that he drools semen. 26minutes32seconds Robert the hedgehog walks in on a strange porn film that involves a Cow with unusual piercing on her udders, and a cockroach with a whip. 32minutes53seconds A sneaky fly has been having a cuisine in Harry the Rabbit's toilet. Need I say more? 34minutes23seconds A drug addicted frog tells young Robert what Vietnam war was like.

Though the characters are obviously puppets, through great voice-acting and puppeteering skills I found myself caring for (and in some cases, loathing) all of the cast of The Feebles.The Feebles are a group of animals who put on variety shows periodically. Their next show is to be enormous, but through various diversions such as drug deals, a rabbit-infected with AIDS, a giant sea monster, affairs, pornographic-movie-making, and a machine-gun killing-frenzy, the show is constantly looming closer and closer as all hell breaks loose for all involved.Whilst it does have cynical and dark sarcastic undertones to the movie, there are a few genuinely touching moments. My particular favourite is a racoon named Robert (but said with a 'w', ie; Wobert). Any scene involving him evokes such tender pity as he tries to serenade his crush with a flamenco guitar, and tries to find his way to the Stage Manager for the first time.Musically, this film is a delight;  I find myself humming 'Garden of Love,' quite regularly. And in music, the film contrasts just as heavy as it's characters.However, I am of Generation X and consequently, the goriness towards the end of the film is not as shocking to me as it would be to someone who has watched 'Snow White' all their lives. Same goes with the drugs, puppet-sex, and the language.

It was the sick, twisted and revolting cult-trilogy of bare guts, brain-pieces, cruel butchery, loose-limbs, flying gore, mutilated corpses and splashing vomit. It gave him the well-earned reputation as the king of all bad taste and absolutely nothing suggested that he would eventually change his warped visions and direct something that's actually sane. This is the middle one of these three shameless feasts of violence and morbid abnormities. Dubious topics like savage mass slaughter, obscene sexual perversions, drug-dealing, repulsive venereal disease and heroin addiction aren't very suitable elements for a cheerful comedy but Peter Jackson found a perfect way to create one that included all of 'em by using puppets as an actors. When a bunch of animals - different sorts and sizes - are practicing all of these objectionable acts it immediately turns out to be comical. Want it or not. Movie contains only two puppets that are actually quite cute and sympathetic - sweet little hedgehog known as Robert and an amusing worm called Arthur. Almost all the other ones are offensive in one way or another.There's a drug addict frog that suffers from serious withdrawal symptoms, chain-smoking sewer rat who shoots porn flicks and Indian contortionist who's head accidentally gets stuck in his rectum. The most grotesque character of Meet the Feebles is probably the obtrusive reporter fly who eats shit with a spoon - I guess sense of shame is something that Jackson just isn't able to feel. My favorite character is definitely the director of Meet the Feebles variety hour - bitter fox called Sebastian. This film has some pretty clever songs like One leg missing and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who's favorite scene of the whole movie is the part when Sebastian sings the hilariously indecent number called Sodomy. I have no recollection of how many times I've been rewinding that same stupid song but I can assure you over and over again. Another spectacular scene is flashback-sequence to Vietnam war. Bunch of frogs represents American soldiers and during only few minutes Jackson makes a cheap parody of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter. If you love puppets, don't ever watch Meet the Feebles. If you possess a sick sense of humor and you think you're prepared for a movie that's full of insane animals that will do basically everything that's grotesque you can enjoy this disgusting and absurd classic as much as I did. 10/10.

This seems to be the central premise of Peter Jackson's completely unhinged Meet the Feebles.This was the second Jackson film I'd seen (Dead/Alive being the first).  I'd never heard of it, but a small, local theater (The Grand Illusion, for you Seattleites) was running a revival; I went in knowing nothing whatsoever.  Consequently, I spent the next hour-and-a-half repeating I can't believe he did that every ten minutes.  Barely a minute passes without something thoroughly shocking, grotesque, offensive or objectionable happening onscreen.There has never been, nor, I imagine, will there ever be, anything remotely like this movie.  The very idea of watching ersatz Muppets engage in kinky group sex, drug use, and mob violence is so shockingly original as to border on genius.  Yes, it goes over the top, it goes too far, and you will be just plain grossed out at times.  But even then, you'll be laughing, even if it's just in disbelief.This continues the Peter Jackson tradition that not only will none of his films be quite like anything you've seen, they won't even resemble one another very much.  No true fan of twisted cinema should miss this film; it belongs on the shelf with such rarefied works as Jackson's own Dead/Alive and Trey Parker's Cannibal! The Musical.

However, since Peter Jackson is directing it, you know you're in for a (very) wild ride! I think Peter Jackson is one of the most original (if not thÃ© most original) film-makers alive. BAD TASTE and especially BRAINDEAD (DEAD ALIVE) show his incredible ability to make something very very original out of almost nothing. He shot BAD TASTE for example with a couple of friends and with a budget about ten thousand times (or something close to that) smaller than that of TITANIC. The result is one of the most outrageous, goriest and funniest films ever made.  His Hollywood efforts (THE FRIGHTENERS, HEAVELY CREATURES) are not as good as these films, though the latter was widely praised. I think Peter Jackson is at his best when making films with a small budget, that go further than you'd expect. The gore genre seems to have his trademark. I really can't wait to see THE LORD OF THE RINGS-trilogy. I'm no fan of these fantasy/adventure, special effects laden movies, but I'm sure Peter Jackson will make something special out of it. The only thing I'm afraid of is the size of the budget. As I said, I really think that this wonderful director is at his best when working with nearly no budget at all. Oh, I almost forgot to say something about this film! Well, it's not the Muppet Show, but think about what you can do with those characters so that it's not a film for children anymore ... at all!

This nasty little follow up number was filmed on grant money from the New Zealand government (apparantly), and I don't for one moment imagine that anyone could consider it a sound investment. Essentially a sleazy version of the muppets, with perhaps a more satirical edge on the real showbiz industry, this film attempts to be more subversive than that well known kiddies programme by throwing taste and caution to the winds and assaulting the viewers senses with as much depravity as possible. Suffice it to say that this would NEVER have got by in live action form.I'm a big Peter Jackson fan, and have nothing but respect for his skill and ambition as a director, but try as I might I found this film to be thoroughly unlikeable in almost every conceivable way. I imagine that that was the point, but even black comedies (and this could not be blacker) have to have some kind of angle from which the viewer can see the film and come away satisfied. This simply repells in a deeply unpleasant fashion.Which is a pity really, seeing as the art direction, the puppets themselves (check out the homage to Rocksteady from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the Scottish Warthog/Boar) and especially the voices (the absolute highlights being Trevor the rats Peter Lorre type rasp and Sebastians sublime riffing on Basil Brush) all point to a film that should have been so much more.

This week I popped it into my VCR and watched it when I was getting ready for work.I'd heard the comments............ ......it's EEEEEEEVILLLLL.... Muppets on CrackHow right those comments were....and more....Meet the Feebles is a dark, thoroughly repulsive opus with animal characters that are, by and large, extremely unlikable with no redeeming qualities at all.  For those not in the know, it's a movie telling of the backstage antics of the performers in the Meet The Feebles variety show For 92 minutes, you watch these characters bed, spit on and in general abuse each other for their own selfish means. The only character I found myself liking was Robert, a shy hedgehog who wants to be part of the cast....and this because he was able to retain his basic innocence while working with his unlikable fellow cast members. Not only are the characters unlikable, the script also leaves much to be desired.  There are several sequences that seem to be added by director John Waters (er...Peter Jackson) just to push the envelope of taste.  For example, did he really have to write into the script a subplot about the misery of a hare dying from the big one (aids) and a reporter fly who seems to gloat in said hare's misfortune?  I think not.Speaking of the script (and the characters) I found myself smiling with grim satisfaction at the end of the movie, when Heidi Hippo (the show's main star) finally becomes unhinged and mows practically the entire cast down with a machine gun.  Good riddance to bad rubbish I thought. I'm also happy that Robert (the hedgehog mentioned above) and Arthur (a worm and a halfway decent bloke himself) survive the bloodbath-both were innocents and didn't deserve to die.

Now it's hard to say.If you were to tell me (at any point in the '90's) that the director of this film would go on to not only create one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time, but win an Oscar for it, I would have laughed at you. That's not to say this movie is bad. It's not perfect, but what it lacks in budget it makes up for in ambition and having a sense of humor about itself.Meet The Feebles is a movie about puppets (both hand puppets and people in suits) who, like the Muppets, are not assumed to be puppets in their universe. Also like the Muppets, the Feebles host a weekly variety show whose audience is also comprised of puppets, and no humans whatsoever. The Feebles are all different animals who have all different personalities. Sounds like a kids movie? Keep reading.Among these characters, there is only one who could easily fit into the real Muppet Show. That character is a hedgehog (or a porcupine. It's hard to tell) named Robert, around whom the movie centers. Robert is the newest cast member on the Meet The Feebles Variety Hour. He is naive but good-natured, and develops an innocent crush on a poodle named Lucile (who actually looks like a bear, but that's just my opinion). Other than the worm stage manager Arthur, these are the only good-natured creatures in the movie. The rest are out of a parents' nightmare, which is why kids under the age of 15 should stay away from this movie.There's the host of the show, Harry the Rabbit, whose health is degenerating because of a supposed STD. The star of the show, Heidi The Hippo, has an overeating problem and is correctly concerned that her husband, Bletch the Walrus, is cheating on her. Meanwhile, Bletch is involved in a shady drug deal with Barry the Bulldog. A frog named Wynyard is a drug-addicted Vietnam veteran who has flashbacks. A gay stagehand fox named Sebastian has a penchant for sodomy, and performs a song about it despite warnings from the crew. And then there's a rat named Trevor who makes hardcore porn films in the studio basement, and is easily the creepiest, and ugliest, creature in the movie. These are just a few of the characters in, I repeat, a movie that's not for kids. The situations make for hilarity in the film, but this film could traumatize children. It really could.It's refreshing that Jackson created his own characters, rather than making parodies of each individual Muppet. While Heidi the Hippo is clearly influenced by Miss Piggy, the rest of the characters are original and therefore often funny the times you can tell what they're saying. The sound on this film is fuzzy, even on the independently-released DVD, and you have to turn your TV up to understand some of the dialogue in these characters.The lighting also could have been better. To the filmmaker's credit, the lack of lighting gave this film a dark and unfriendly ambiance which is well deserved. However, the light could have been brighter on the good characters (such as Robert and Lucille) and darker on the bad characters (like Bletch) to show obvious contrast between the characters. Instead, it looked as though the filmmakers used one light to film the entire production, and instead of making the film look intentionally creepy, it looks unintentionally crappy.Although Peter Jackson is now a major name in Hollywood, you're still hard-pressed to find this movie on DVD. It has been released on two different DVDs in the U.S., but both of them are a.) hard to find, b.) of low quality, and c.) released by an independent studio who included no special features of any kind. Now that it's 20 years since the movie has been made, it's high time they release a 20th Anniversary DVD of the film.Although Meet The Feebles is far from perfect, it's a great parody of not only the Muppets, but other puppet productions that contain wall-to-wall cuteness. What Ralph Bakshi did for family-friendly cartoons which would otherwise seem cute and cuddly in Fritz The Cat, Jackson does for these kids puppets who would otherwise have family appeal in Meet The Feebles. It's demented and funny, but hasn't gotten the release or restoration it deserves. Hopefully that will change in the near future.

I have a feeling that the only hilarious thing about it is that the characters are all animal puppets, obviously very similar to those that, only ten years previous to watching this film, I used to love and get taught by on Sesame Street. But these animals had a serious sting in their tale.The tagline to the film is 'Hell hath no fury like a hippo with a machine gun'. Is this a hilarious fantastical romp, or a dark arty movie designed to haunt your sleep for years? My answer - it could be both, but for me it was the latter.Admittedly I was only ten or eleven years old when I saw this movie and presumably a lot of the jokes went above my head. But for most of the movie, it was all too clear and all to disturbing what was going on. The concept of a puppet of a sewage rat is enough in itself, but when that sewage rat puppet then proceeds to make cheap underground porno films with some disturbingly graphic visual puppet sequences, it gets to be too much. Similarly an adorable rabbit puppet smitten with venereal disease is a bit too much to bear.Maybe I'm a bit too biased, I'm sure I could watch this movie again and laugh along despite the resurgence of unpleasant memories, but I can assure you that no matter how strong your composure, this film is no stroll in the tulips. Some arty comedies are fun, while others shake you to the bone. All I can do is marvel at how far Peter Jackson has come. 2 1/2 stars out of 5.

This is the sort of thing the Muppets would be in the REAL world of showbiz!There are very few sympathetic characters in this movie, but the bad guys, such as the corrupt producer Bletch the Walrus and his sidekick, a Peter Lorre-like rat named Trevor, are great characters.  The good guys, including gay fox director Sebastian and loveable stage manager Arthur the Worm are also fully-rounded characters. There are also the rather two-dimensional lovers, Robert the Hedgehog and Lucille the Poodle, but they are likeable compared with some of the other characters.SPOILER WARNING It is the day of the TV debut of THE FABULOUS FEEBLES VARIETY HOUR, a hit variety show, and basically, everything that can go wrong does go wrong.  Their MC, a bed-hopping rabbit catches a serious disease which may or may not be sexually transmitted, their star, the Miss Piggy-like hippo Heidi, is going through a stage of depression, the knife thrower (a drug-addicted Vietnam-vet frog) has accidentally killed his assistant and a sleazy fly reporter (aptly described by Arthur as 'a no-good muck raker from the gutter press') is doing his damdest to spread nasty behind-the-scenes rumours.  Not only this, but producer Bletch is involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side, such as drug-dealing and making porn movies in the cellar.Ultimately, the film is enjoyable,and rather moralistic.  All the 'bad' people in the story like Bletch, Trevor and the Fly are punished, while all the 'good' people like Robert, Lucille, Arthur etc. live happily ever after.The songs are particularly good, the show-stopper being Heidi's touching ballad 'Garden of Love'.

Take muppets and make them do the unthinkable.  This would be a great shock if you were in the medium = content frame of mind, where cartoons and puppets are always for children.  However, if you've seen a range of anime, you've probably overcome that mental barrier, so seeing puppets have sex and do drugs is probably no more shocking than seeing cartoons have sex and do drugs.  If that's the case, the shock value won't carry you, and what's left is the content of the movie itself.  Meet the Feebles is actually hampered by its use of puppets, as none of the violence, sex, or other disgustingness can be done very well.  Peter Jackson and crew did amazing work with the limited resources that they had, but it isn't quite enough.  The only scenes that really get a Braindead-like eww... are the fly eating feces scene and Harry's super-vomit scene.  The story itself is just an excuse for a collage of shock scenes, which is why the movie ultimately fails.  If a movie is made to showcase shock scenes which aren't shocking, there isn't much left.  Though not a bad movie, per se, it ends up being somewhat bland.

We've got a depressed elephant, a pantie-sniffing ant eater, an oversensitive hedgehog, a frog who fought in Vietnam and now he's addicted to every possible drug, a rabbit who screws every female on the set, a hippo with an eating disorder and a giant cigar-smoking walrus who runs the crazy place. All these animals have their own problems which influence their work. None of them can actually stand another but they have to try and make a show together. Meanwhile, the boss of the whole thing, Bletch (the Walrus) is involved in all sorts of crime. Great!! But the most memorable character certainly is Trevor...He's a sarcastic chain-smoking rat who sells dope, makes snuff movies and rapes dogs. I'd say Give him an Oscar! He's brilliant. Maybe you shouldn't watch this film if you're easily offended or if you can't handle too much gore. Because, it's not because they're puppets they don't bleed. Au contrary, I would say. They die Braindead-style ! The film is filled with humor but it's from the darkest kind of humor that exists. So if you liked Sleepless in Seattle or Pretty Woman...maybe this isn't your cup of tea.

The characters, and I use that term loosely, seem to feed off of each other with absolutely no thread of decency or discretion.Despite all of this film's flaws, I can think of two characters that I could actually relate to.  The first was the chicken that wandered around with its head blown off.  It sounds cruel but I can't think of a better way to describe how I felt while watching this film.  The second character I could relate to was the hippo that massacred all of the other puppets.  I related with the hippo because at this point in the film all of the characters had become so annoying that I couldn't stand them anymore.  And, frankly, I couldn't think of another way that this film could have ended other than a bloodbath of severed fluffy puppet parts.Even though I have many bad things to say about MEET THE FEEBLES, I didn't give this film a one.  I think it takes a lot of bad movie making to create a movie that deserves the lowest score.

Basically, in a world full of puppet characters, are the Feebles theatrical troupe of performers, with their Variety Hour drawing in the crowds. The star of the show is Heidi the Hippo (Mark Hadlow) is really upset when she catches boyfriend Bletch the Walrus (Peter Vere-Jones) having sex with Samantha the Cat (Donna Akersten), and she is doing her best to carry on with the show. New arrival Robert the Hedgehog (Hadlow) wants to become part of the stage act, with the permission of Arfur the Worm (Vere-Jones), who also introduces him to Robert's new love interest Lucille the Poddle. There is also Eyes in the Sky the Fly (Brian Sergent) is trying to scoop a big story involving Harry the Rabbit, and his sexual activities and illness could be the big one. Also, Trevor the Rat (Sergent) is trying to find the next big star for his porn movies, to join Madame Bovine aka Daisy the Cow (Devenie), and he is looking at Lucille. In front of the show audience, Sid the Elephant (Mark Wright) faces his baby responsibility, Robert can't face Lucille after finding out about her escapade with Trevor, and Harry is believes he is dying from a sexual transmitted disease, until Dr. Quack (Devenie) puts him straight. While all this happens at once, Heidi finally loses the plot and gets a M60 machine gun to shoot anyone and everyone in her way, killing Samantha, Harry, Sandy the Chicken (Devenie), Dorothy the Sheep (Akersten), Trevor, and of course Bletch. In the end the film reveals what all the living characters did after parting their ways from the Feebles fame. Also starring Hadlow as Barry the Bulldog, Sergent as Wynyard the Frog, Wright as The Cockroach and Louie the Fish, and Danny Mulheron as the singing voice of Heidi. If the Muppets were like us in a dark and screwed up world, this is what it would be like, full of swearing, sex, drugs, prostitution, rape, disease, Hippo's breasts and excrement. It is relatively amusing seeing cute and cuddly puppet characters behaving rude, sick and disgusting, Heidi is definitely the next Miss Piggy, but it one of those films that's maybe a little close to the mark in black comedy.

The jokes were predictable and unfunny, the plot was threadbare and weak, and the only reason I think anybody likes this movie is simply because it's got an imitation Kermit the Frog on smack and a cat bl*wing a walrus. Why is this tripe a cult classic? Is this what constitutes groundbreaking originality? Ha-Freakin-Ha. That was sarcasm. The hero of this 97 minute long fecal log is an obnoxious, whining, self-pitying pink hippo who can't stop stuffing bakery cakes down her gullet long enough to figure out why nobody likes her anymore. Sure, her walrus boyfriend is cheating on her, but besides the degradation of both her stage career and her body (of which both things are certainly her own fault), there is nothing else wrong in her life. Somehow, this justifies the machine-gun slaughter of all the folks she knows. This mass murdering Hippo (whose character is a blatant ripoff of Hoppopotomus on that 80's cartoon The Wuzzles) serves only ten years in prison at the end, as if her inverted sadness excuses her heinous crimes. Sure, the bad guy of a Walrus and his hustling rat pal are dead, but so are a whole bunch of one-note characters that we barely heard from during the movie at all, and simply didn't deserve to die at the Hippo's hands. Usually, I giggle at mass-murder vengeance in movies (if the killer is righteous, ala Frank Castle), but this stupid, selfish, gluttonous hippo just makes the almost-cool end of this insufferable film all the more detestable. From the very boring musical number at the beginning to the brainlessly unsatisfying end, there is nothing worth writing about that happened in between.

You can now find my reviews on Cinemasickness.com/Teamsickness.I take it upon myself to re-watch movies to see if they are worse or better than I remember. I reviewed this film as my 200th review. Consider this a rewrite. Since then I saw reviews saying that this was a film to see and it was some peoples favorite film, which is weird but I am not one to judge people. I am here to judge this film. Is it better or worse than when I reviewed i?. Well believe it or not, it somehow manages to be worse than before. There is no other film that has made me more disgusted and has made me angrier than Meet The Feebles. This movie is so bad that I could analyze and nitpick every single thing wrong about this film but I'll spare you the time. When I revisited this film I saw at least 15 things that I left out of my original review. So let's get started.Heidi The Hippo is upset because, during rehearsal, Trevor The Rat insults her. Heidi Runs to her lover Bletch The Walrus (Which provokes interesting thoughts) and Bletch comforts her. Beltch is secretly having an affair with Samantha The Siamese Cat (and shows you all of their Interactions). We also have Harry The Hare who gets sick after Little Bunny Froo Froo went hopping through the forest. Also a hedgehog who is in love with a poodle, a chicken married to an elephant, a drug addicted frog and the walrus doing drug deals. This I can not make up.Well the story is a good place to start. The main story itself is buried under so many ridiculous subplots it's awful. Also the movie does not know which story to go to because the film keeps jumping around like I just opened a can of Jumping Beans. The stories are terrible, every single one of them. Now all of the plots I mentioned are only half of what is in the film. The rest are either not worth mentioning, or I can't put them in this review or else the wonderful folks over at IMDb Would kick me off forever. We wouldn't want that now would we? The characters... are the most disgusting and vile creatures I have ever seen. The Hippo is star hungry, The walrus is money hungry, The frog is a drug addicted wreck, The rabbit likes to go hopping without protection, The rat is an adult film director and plus there is an Indian running around with his head up his own Rectum! What the hell is going on here? I feel like someone was taking a ride on the LSD train while writing this. These Characters Are Mean-Spirited and soulless. You want investing characters? HA! Don't be ridiculous! There are no characters that you can invest in. Well there are 2 but to be honest they only have 4 minutes of screen time each. Thats not Good.This movie also tries to pass itself off as a musical. I find that hard to believe because there is not a single song in this worthless piece of trash that you can remember, and if you do remember the songs, they stick in your head until you want to put a gun to your head and pull the trigger. The soundtrack includes such classics like, I got one leg missing, The S***** Song and the always classic Garden Of Love. Meet The Feebles does not pass as a musical. A comedy that does pass as a musical is the 1999 film, South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut. That movie was also a satire, and it worked. This does not. Oh, and by the way, Just what the hell is this movie trying to be a satire of, because I'm not seeing it. Apparently, My intelligence is no match for this film.The Ending. This movie features, without a doubt, the worst ending in a feature-length motion picture I have ever seen. There will be spoilers but in all honesty you should stay away from this film. The ending starts with Heidi Trying to commit suicide by hanging herself but due to her being fat(Ha-Ha), she falls down to the basement. She then grabs a gun and decides to go on a shooting rampage. By this point in the film I wanted strangle myself, but I pushed on because there was less than 10 minutes left. She literally kills everybody but 6 people. The Hedgehog and the Poodle have kids(I'm Not sure how that would work), The Elephant and his son live a quiet life, And the worm retires. The next moment made me so mad I wanted to punch the screen I was watching. The Hippo gets only 10 years and then goes to work in a supermarket. Are you kidding me?!!? Have you had any criminal history. Oh nothing big, just that I went on a big shooting rampage and killed over 50 people. Your Hired!.

I could list the revolting images, but the list would itself be revolting; suffice it say that you can live happily without seeing them, but if you DO see them, you may find them uncomfortably hard to forget.  Choose wisely.  (Remember why it is that films like this manage to find an audience in the first place - it's because people who haven't seen them don't know what they're missing, and so aren't as grateful as they ought to be.)  The fact that these are muppets, rather than live actors, vomiting, shooting up, dying in pools of their own blood, and so forth, only makes matters worse it's that much harder to disengage.  I, for one, was involved to the end.  So it's not, as some people have been unable to resist calling it, a feeble film on the contrary, it has been crafted with skill, so as to be positively and pungently bad.

It wasn't funny, shocking, or interesting.  It was just god awful.  I like weird and unusual movies and this was neither, just plain stupid. Sorry if I'm repeating myself I just want to get the point across.

No area rental joint had it, so I bought it on Amazon.It was terrible.  The sound was bad - reminds you of trying to understand everything in Snatch, but they weren't in England!This is the kind of movie that is a brilliant brilliant brilliant idea - done terribly wrong.  Not overly gross to top it off.  The funniest part still is my mp3 of 'sodomy'!Save your cash - rent Airplane or Pandemonium (1982) instead.

Indeed it was gross, rude an disturbing at some points. Black twisted humor and not a single character I really liked.Don't get me wrong, South Park jokes and Wayne's World are favorites of mine, but this simply is either outdated sick humor or art-house comedy. Either way, it's not that funny as other comments have said.All clichÃ©s like good guys, bad guys, addicts and the showbiz way of doing business can be found here. BUT HEY, WHERE'S THE MUSICAL PART?! A few notes, the Feebles tune that comes around a few times... It's not like Annie or the Sound of the Music? Heck, even South Park The Movie had multiples times more of a soundtrack. Just skip this one. "}]
