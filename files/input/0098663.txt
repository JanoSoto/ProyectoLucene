[{"Title":"i love the power glove. it's my mommie.","Date":"18 July 2004","Score":"63 out of 77 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Somewhere along the line, someone realized that it's nigh impossible to   make a good movie based on a video game. So instead, they made a movie   about the entire Nintendo Entertainment System, thereby capturing all the   feel-good nostalgia associated with its hundreds of titles, but without crippling handicaps such as an unfeasible plot or Jean-Claude VanDamme as Colonel William F. Guile. Thus was born The Wizard...a shameless consumerist repackaging of The Who's Tommy, adjusted for a new audience and coming at you in full-on buddy film fashion.    Fred Savage explodes onto the screen as a curly-haired dork with highly  articulate eyebrows. He's caught between his divorced parents in a   custody battle over his autistic, obsessive-compulsive, equinophobic, dyslexic, colorblind kid brother Jimmy. Realizing that being in the custody of one or more of his parents will most certainly kill Jimmy (and that Jimmy has the superhuman ability to reach level 3 on Double Dragon),   Fred Savage does the right thing and whisks his kid brother off to   exploit his virtuosic video game playing ability for cash and prizes   worth well over $130.    Along the way they meet Haley, who's totally hot if you're 12. Haley   misleads Fred and Jimmy on many occasions, notably one scene where   renegade truckers steal their entire video game pilgrimage budget and   presumably, molest them. Still, they stick to their guns (or should I say, their Nintendo LIGHT GUNS, for use with Duck Hunt), even managing to outsmart the enigmatic Lucas, a rebellious young boy who apparently lives alone in the desert like Mohammed. Only this messiah has a Nintendo POWER GLOVE,  buy yours today!    Lucas complicates the story, creating a sordid love triangle between   himself, Fred Savage and Haley. He taunts Jimmy ruthlessly (We   wouldn't want you to...WHIZ on yourself.) and, despite having devoted his life to Nintendo games and thus presumably having no friends, a crowd of   prepubescent disciples follow him at all times. His secret to success is the Nintendo Power Glove, which is, in Lucas's own words, so bad. But as most of us know, the truth is that the Nintendo Power Glove was totally gay. It only did what you wanted it to do when you were punching your friend in the face with it to vent your frustration about its lack of response.    The protagonists' path is beset by peril on all sides. There are   teenage white trash hoodlums who exist solely for the purpose of   stealing Jimmy's hat and saying lines like What is this kid, some sort of cyborg? There are fat salesmen who talk like Foghorn Leghorn, unable to believe that a scrawny kid is better than they are at Contra.    And don't get me started on the creepy bald guy hired by Fred's mom to   bring the kids back home, dead or alive. His name is Putnam and repeatedly   touches Haley's breasts. Meanwhile, Beau Bridges plays Nintendo like my   dad, yanking the controller this way and that. Every time Beau Bridges   and Christian Slater run into Putnam, a redneck banjo riff kicks in and   the whole movie starts to sound like a Menard's commercial while the adversaries engage in automobile/ gardening tool combat.    Saved from certain molestation by a grotesque man-child named Spanky,   their adventure climaxes when they play Ninja Gaiden with a scary   gravel-voiced MC (who also seems to be a child molester) and nearly get eaten by a fake King Kong at UNIVERSAL STUDIOS THEMEPARK, now open! By the way, Jimmy knows the exact location of the Warp Whistle in Super Mario Bros. 3 prior to the game's release because he reads Nintendo Power Magazine. Jimmy gets the warp whistle and uses it to reach World 4 (yes, Giant World) and Lucas looks on helplessly as his empire of Power Gloves comes crashing down around him.    Spackled with golden dialogue, this movie is a subculture in its own   right. But while many people quote Lucas's it's so bad, or Haley's   he touched my breast, for me it doesn't get any better than when Christian Slater says,    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

For this set, born in the late '70s and early '80s, the excitement in the air was palpable when previews for the film appeared on TV. It not only combined our two favorite entertainment vehicles -- Nintendo and movies -- but also provided a thrilling sneak preview of the year's most anticipated game, Super Mario Bros. 3. NES geeks (of course they weren't geeks back then... Nintendo was cool) thought they'd died and gone to eight-bit heaven.When we finally got mom and dad to take us to the theater or pick up the video, THE WIZARD was every bit as good as we'd hoped. Critics almost universally panned it as a 90-minute Nintendo commercial, but young viewers were enthralled. (Besides... a 90-minute Nintendo commercial wasn't exactly an awful thing!). The film combined very human storytelling with hardy laughs and wide-eyed exhilaration. It gave us playground catchphrases (Lucas with I love the Power Glove. It's so bad and Jimmy with Calli-forn-ya... Calli-forn-ya!) Sure the highlight was all the cool video game-related stuff, but video games were a big part of our lives, one that our parents just didn't understand. The people who made this movie, whatever their intentions, did.Most eight- or nine- or ten-year-olds who caught THE WIZARD upon release would give it two big thumbs up, if not the Oscar for Best Picture of All-Time. Of course we're not eight or nine or ten anymore, and THE WIZARD, in hindsight, is not actually a cinematic masterpiece. But nor is it the sort of mindless junk that stuffy critics would have us believe. The film is actually a sweet, harmless cross-country adventure. It has laughs (who could forget Haley's scream of He touched my breast! to ward off the hapless Putnam?) and emotion (Jimmy's reflections of his late sister are undeniably heartbreaking). And the video game competition finale holds up surprisingly well even with the novelty of the Super Mario Bros. 3 footage long worn off.Beyond that, THE WIZARD carries deeper meanings that children can pick up on. Jimmy, the autistic video game prodigy, demonstrates that all of us, regardless of our limitations, possess marvelous gifts. Putnam, the cold-hearted family services worker trying to take Jimmy away, helps illustrate that families are what matter. And the villainous Lucas is an example of how we should treat our enemies with dignity and by letting our actions speak louder than our words, as Jimmy does. Okay, it's not exactly Nietzsche, but it's not total fluff, either.THE WIZARD is not the greatest movie of all-time. It's probably not even a great movie. But it is a special period piece, a reminder of a simpler time when our only worry in the world was passing math and knocking off goombas. It will forever hold a special place in the hearts of many.

Yes, the plot is predictable and cheesy and the writing leaves a lot to be desired, but I guarantee if you fall into the above group, you will enjoy regressing back to 1989 where having all 97 games, and the power glove (it's so bad...) were major status symbols.  If you don't fall into this group, or couldn't really care less about old video games, then you should probably pass on this film.  But for the rest of us, (I used to watch the commercial for this film just to get a glimpse at Super Mario Bros. 3) watch it and enjoy it time after time.

Corey and Jimmy are half-brothers. Jimmy has a dead twin sister. Mom has a new boyfriend. Dad owns a landscaping business. Throw in Christian Slater as a bad-ass older brother, a love triangle with three 13 year olds, the power-glove, and the song Send Me and Angel by Real Life and you have 1 intense peice of cinema. Watch out for cameos by the black dude from Batteries Not Included*, a guy with the same voice as Dicky Barrett, and Las Vegas.

The story follows a little boy who, like Tommy, is non associative to sound or picture and can beat the toughest arcade games of his day without batting an eyelash.Depression brought on by the tragic loss of his twin sister, Jennifer, and his family's refusal to discuss the situation leads seven-year-old Jimmy Woods to hide deeper and deeper inside himself. Searching for answers he concludes that if he can only return to the place on Earth where he was happiest, where the best time in his life occurred, he will be able to truly be happy again. Lunch pail in hand and nothing but his own intuition to guide him the young boy sets off on a trip to California. We can only imagine the horrors that have filled Jimmy's life with his preadolescent confusion and dis-understanding of the reality of things around him. His wanting to just hear the words that it's all right. Jimmy is fascinated with patterns and observing the narrowing toward the peak of a pyramid watching a pattern shorten, in essence move faster. Similar, in an analog sense, to the ascending difficulty in repeating patterns of the motions of video game characters on a television screen.Corey Woods, Jimmy's older half brother, through their father, loves his brother. He wants no harm or fear to ever enter Jimmy's life and wants only for his sibling to live happily in the company of family and friends. Corey, coincidentally, decides to run away to California with Jimmy to keep him out of a home for the mentally disabled.Haley is the know it all, all grown up kid who tries her damnedest to hold the world together. Wants to prove to her father that she's got it together. Her mother, who got lost in an addiction to gambling and unspecified drugs, left her father. Haley wants to prove to herself as much as to her father that she's got it together. So much so that she can travel cross country alone at twelve, so much so that she can gamble against nothing and come out on the very top.Sam Woods fills in most of the comic relief as he and his eldest son, Nick, spend the movie in a race and chase against the children's bounty hunter, a snyde ass-bag of a fellow, real easy character to hate, called Putnam. Putnam was hired by Sam's ex-wife and Jimmy's mother, Christine, and her new husband, Mr. Bateman, to track down the runaway children. He sees Jimmy and Corey as a meal ticket and he refuses to let anything get between him and his money. He has several encounters with Sam and Nick on his hunt and tries to stop them every step of the way with as many underhanded schemes as he can come up with from slashing Sam's tires to selling Sam's truck to a chop-shop. He is representation of all seven mortal sins and, while Sam is nowhere near a perfect person, it is easy to cheer him on every time he gets a step ahead of, or attacks, Mister Putnam. Through the film, Sam and Nick get to play several video games and come to a sort of understanding of one another that they hadn't had since Jennifer was alive, a sort of comradery that ought to exist between every son and father but is so rare.Lucas is the reigning video game champion and has a thug crew who hang onto him because he is as close as they will ever get to anything worthwhile as Lucas hangs onto the video games in the same manner. Lucas is not necessarily an evil character and at the end there is a sense of humbling within him as he does come to realize slightly that winning isn't everything and losing won't kill you.Along their journey, the kids are helped by various people in parts of society that most would try to shy away from, truckers and gamblers and lesbian bikers, to be specific. The story also shows that even if you think you know who you are getting a ride from, you should beware because greed can make even the seemingly nicest person into a monster.The story is simple, yet worthwhile three kids go across the country to do something that they had never thought to do before, it recommends that real adventure should coexist with electronic diversion if you're going to have electronic diversion; and it also shows us that there is a time and a place for everything. It shows kids that if they are ever in trouble with a stranger, it is always a good idea to scream. In the end, Jimmy is more social but still has a long way to go before anyone might consider him normal; but it shows definite progress in his character.Even though the situation is ridiculous in parts, it is still touching and fun. This is a great family film, which can make the family video game machine be more than just a toy.I highly recommend it regardless of your age or family status.

It's got it all--an excellent and hilarious story, great music, excellent actors, and above all--that little 80s console of long hours of entertainment known as The Nintendo. The Wizard was made to feul sales for Nintendo in promoting it's newest video game, Super Mario Brothers 3, which I understand to be the company's best selling game of all time (and with good reason). The story involves three kids, struggling for independence from their messed up family life. Fred Savage plays Cory, who's father and brother tend to change the subject of the uncomfortable fact that his half-brother Jimmy is going to be put in a foster home. Not if Cory can help it. He and Jimmy go Shanghai for California, the land of possibility. Along the way, they meet Haley, a hot shot young girl who's father is a truck driver and mother is a gambling addict. On her way to Reno, she discovers that Jimmy is a video game wizard (like the Pinball Wizard). With the Video Game Armaggeddon just weeks away, Haley comes up with the idea that the three kids should pool their resources, go to California, compete, and split the cash.It may seem like an easy goal--heading from Utah to California on a skateboard and a couple of bucks, hustling video game hacks along the way. But meanwhile, a crazy bounty hunter kind of guy has been hired to bring Jimmy (and only Jimmy) back home. He's similarly in a competition--against Corey's father, who needs to get to the kids first before the crazy bounty hunter does. This movie has it all. You get to see some the greatest Nintendo games (Double Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) The Adventures of Zelda, Excite Bike, and Rad Racer) in addition to other Nintendo accessories such as The Power Glove (I love the Power Glove, it's so bad.) It's so effective in selling Nintendo nostalgia (though it wasn't quite nostalgia when the movie was made), that it will make you want to pull out the old console--or emulator--and have a crack or two at some games again.Additionally, you have an excellent cast of actors involved in a hilarious cat-and-mouse chase, with the most laughs coming from the traveling dispute of the bounty hunter and Corey's dad (Beau Bridges). Plus, how can you go wrong with an early Fred Savage, Jennifer Rilo Kiley Lewis, and Christian Slater movie? You can't. It's packed to the brim with excellent features that if you're in love with the 80s, you're sure to enjoy.

Not only did the 'Glove turn out to be so bad, but it couldn't actually be used with the game it was in the movie. Essentially, this film is one long commercial for a product that didn't work as advertised. And now with its long-awaited DVD release, Wizard (like Wonka before it) has long outlasted the product it was created to shill.That being said, I personally don't think this picture is a bad film. Not by any means. The story is compelling, the acting (particularly the traumatized boy) is above par, the drama is well-executed and not overdone, lending to some very humorous (and intentional) moments, and the message is timeless. In fact, the climax (with just a little suspension of disbelief) will have you eagerly awaiting the outcome whilst all the while rooting for the film's hero to emerge just that.Don't go in with the highest expectations, but surely don't go in expecting a bad 90-minute commercial.

I was only 2 in 1989 so I couldn't see it in the theatre, but I did buy it as fast as I could.  I still love it.  I lot of people will say this movie is garbage.  They are so wrong.  Well, maybe to the people who WEREN'T NES Freaks.  This movie has many classic scenes, I love the power glove, it's so bad.  And I think it's halarious how in true life not ONE of the kids can play a video game!  For instance, when Jimmy is playing Double Dragon, he is pressing buttons at the introduction scene.  And you are just hearing the ounches and the hits as if he were REALLY playing.  And they claim he made 50, 000 points on it, when it just made the noise that he finished level one!  And in Rad Racer, the dude is just starting level 1 with his power glove and everyone is just like, OH MY GOD!! I CAN'T BELEVE HE GOT SO FAR!  There are many other video game related mistaked but I just wanted to point out some.  Anyway, this is a really cool and entertaining movie.

After a long US holiday it was nice seeing a road movie to pass the long hours stuck on the plane. The movie is an utterly shameless 100-minute commercial for Nintendo products, the then imminent release of Super Mario Bros. 3 (even though 2 was never released in the US) and Universal's own Los Angeles theme park, but at the time I was just interested because of all the video games on show, though it does not speak well of youth that even in 1989 video games were still the number 1 sport.The actual plot woven into the commercial is truly heartbreaking though. Young, possibly autistic, catatonic Jimmy Woods (James Woods?) keeps wandering away from home, desperate to get to California. Half-brother Cory (Fred Savage) goes after him, attempting to pacify his desire to get to the west coast state. Cory thinks that Jimmy wants to enter a video game competition at Universal Studios but really he just wants to visit the Cabazon Dinosaurs - the last place of happy memories before the death of his twin sister, and he just wants to let her go.Really heavy-going stuff, and not a film I can enjoy watching as an adult in that regard. The film is poorly directed and features innumerable errors regarding the Nintendo products that they are promoting. How can the kids shout out the secrets of a video game that they have never played and that has only just been announced? For a commercial they sure didn't research their material very well. But it does win back some points for effective use of the original Send me an Angel by Real Life.Christian Slater and Beau Bridges pursue the boys as the older brother and dad, while a feisty teenage girl called Hayley helps them get to their destination on time. The travel montages and locations are all memorable and turn the journey into a nice rites-of-passage.It's become a cult classic in recent years, and will provoke even more nostalgia another 24 years down the line, but the heavy subject matter beneath the Nintendo-plugging means I can't go back again.

This film was almost a dream come true to me because it was one based on the world of gaming. This is an underrated gem (in my book anyway)that I really like and still do to this day. It's also one of the only sports films I really like/love (I personally am not a fan of the sub genre)and there aren't many like it.There is just a lot I really like about the film, watching it again now is more interesting because now it's sort of a time capsule of the 89-90's era. The fashions, video games at the time, the Universial Studio locale when it was young, music you name it. Speaking of the music, I feel this film has one of the best soundtracks which no doubt brew 90's, my favorite is the end credit theme song which is one of my personal favorites called I Found My Way, it's just a beautiful and inspiring song in my book anyway.The highlight no doubt in the visual aspect was the Video Armegenon contest, just the amount of energy and showmanship it had, really makes me which most other video game/PC game tournaments today had that again. But of course it was when the new game at the time was revealed Super Mario Bros 3 I remember seeing that in the film and thought OMG, I never even knew the franchise was even developing a third volume so you can imagine how much it blew my mind. Some would say that the film is a bit dated, personally I think that's an unfair argument to make, if it was some other video game in a film say Halo 7 same thing would happen. You have to understand in 89-90 the video game counterculture was on the rise, not just was it becoming more popular and accessible but also video game technology itself was rapidly developing. However I don't just like this film because it has video games/gaming, but I honestly felt the film has a bit of a heart as well. Like any sports film I really like the characters and there motives.The antagonist that stands out for me despite not being in the film that long is Lucas, he's a villain you love to dislike because we've all seen people like that, whom think their hot stuff, egocentric, have more things than you and like to show off.However the best characters were the three protagonists whom I thought were the best dynamic of the bunch. All three acted and felt like real kids, they weren't stereotypical all smiles annoying kids. Each of these protagonists I thought were sympathetic have suffered loss in a sense and all three wanted some sort of change, I wouldn't say just change in their life but just something good again in their lives, which is something they've never had in a long time. Fred Savage was great as Cory Woods (on a side note, yes I remember the TV show The Wonder Years thats one of my favorite shows). He's a typical adolescent a little rebellious, a gamer he does know his games, he's not too smooth he has a sort of dry witticism to him. But most importantly he does care about his young brother Jimmy Woods (Luke Edwards) whom is the video game wizard. Cory's motive is he simply wants both he and his brother to be a family again and going on this journey with him is the only way to do it.Jenny Lewis I thought was great as Haley, it's a shame this actress didn't have more because I thought she was a capable actress. She sort of reminds me, heck even physically looks a bit like actress Emma Watson. Anyway her character is my favorite, she's fiery, feisty, smart, she has some of the best moments and lines to say. But what I really like is that she has warmth even though she doesn't also show it, she does care about Jimmy and has a bit of a crush on Cory. But there is a bit of sadness to her character, because her character is alone in a way. Doesn't really have many close friends, so Cory is probably the only one she's ever been closest to.The chemistry between both Cory and Haley to me is the other highlight of the movie. Both have just a great back and forth, where at times both give each other intentional or unintentional grief. And yet their relationship develops both care and bond with each other more as the film goes on.But it's true this film isn't perfect I have at least a couple of glitches. I wished in the Video Armeganon elimination sequence it was a montage, where I would of liked to of seen Jimmy play different Nintendo games and knocking down numerous competitors, the fact this didn't happen I thought was a lost opportunity. Certain hiccups in the script, for example 50,000 in Double Dragon which in reality isn't possible (I played and own the game so I know) though I don't feel that was so much a case of bad writing just bad research. Overall I think this is a fun and surprisingly touching sports movie and personally I like to see more sports movies based on the video game subculture. For me it's a fun nolstagia trip I like to take every once in a while, for new viewers it could be a fun history lesson but most importantly a fun movie. The Wizard scores.Rating 3 and a half stars.

One of those things which held much importance at the time was the magazine Nintendo Power. I have seen everything from early Atari with my grandad to Ps3, but never was there anything like NES. For what seems like ten years it had the market cornered and somewhere in that time the execs at NES decided, smartly i might add, to make a film with the best child star actor of all time, Fred Savage! At some point during this time there was a Major rumbling about this movie in Nintendo Power. This is pre-internet here, we had to get together and pass the magazine around to read about this movie, and the kicker was the secret game to be introduced during the climax of the movie. All i can say is this was a total watershed moment in NES history, peoples heads nearly exploded seeing Super Mario 3 on the big screen at the end. It's a movie packed to the brim with one liners and heart. And what i mean by heart is they didn't have to make a movie so utterly depressing about video games. Fred Savage's brother has lost his twin sister who DROWN, and he just wants to go to cccalifornia to put her things back inside a dinosaur. Well this movie confronts all kinds of issues, its a time-capsule and like i said its got a deeper plot then you could imagine for a movie about Italion plumbers. But they did it.

The Wizard combines comedy, drama, and Nintendo by the truckload to form a unique and genuinly moving character study of crazy kids who like Nintendo.The movie concerns the journey to California of Fred Savage, and his brother Jimmy(played with powerful solemnity by some kid), a Nintendo Wizard, as it were.  The goal is to reach a Nintendo Competition, where Jimmy will eventually face Super Mario Brothers 3, a game never seen until the competition.  Along the way, the kids gamble on Jimmy's Nintendo skill, and undergo various non-Nintendo-related adventures.  Various villains include a guy who has to track Jimmy down, and Lucas, the Nintendo rival. Lucas delivers a powerful scene in which he makes mince meat of Rad Racer using the almighty Power Glove (which he keeps in a large protective case).The movie really is carried by the performances of the actors.  The ensemble also includes Christian Slater as the third brother, Beau Bridges as the father, and some girl as the companion to the kids, who comes up with the idea of using Jimmy's Nintendo skill to gamble.  In one classic scene, Christian Slater is berated by the father for his Nintendo playing, and then Slater wakes up in the motel to find Beau playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(a lackluster title, but compelling none the less).The movie would certainly appeal to the Nintendo enthusiasts, but will also appeal to anyone looking for a movie which tackles the serious issue of death, and healing the pain of that loss with Nintendo.  The movie was released in 1989, and Super Mario Bros. 3 was not yet released.  When viewed today, the ending is slightly anti-climactic, but still the emotion of the moment is still present.  As far as problems go, this movie has a few.  The most glaring is the slight error in Nintendo representation.  For example, Jimmy plays Double Dragon on an arcade machine, yet he is clearly playing the Nintendo version of the game, when a different version would be played in an arcade.  Also, as Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, Beau Bridges exclaims that he has reached level 3 in TMNT, yet the screen clearly shows he is on level 1.  This is a minor flaw, but kudos to Ebert for spotting that one. In no way should these flaws dissuade anyone from viewing The Wizard. There are a lot of movies today about Nintendo competitions, but for look at the predecessor, rent The Wizard. Truly a film classic.

He is put into a place for troubled children, and his older half brother (Fred Savage) helps him sneak out and wants to help him get to California. He's angry at his dad for allowing them to put Jimmy away, and angry at his older brother, Christian Slater, who he blames for his half sister's death (Jimmy's twin sister died on a family vacation when CS was supposed to be watching her, and Jimmy has been troubled ever since). The only reason they even play video games along the way is that they need money to fund their trip, and are using Jimmy's talent to hustle for money, and want to win the competition to get money.This movie is truly more centered on why Jimmy is so traumatized, and what exactly is in California that he so desperately wants. It turns out he only wants to return to the place him and Jennifer (his sister) had last been together, and  honor her memory. It makes me teary just thinking about it.The movie itself is entertaining as well as sad, and I would recommend it to anyone.

It's simply a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word designed in the loosest sense possible, because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos.I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you.

Honestly, the game play in this movie is fun and entertaining, but the rest of the film is mainly cheese. However the movie can be useful if you think of it as window into gaming culture back in those days. And you'll even learn a thing or two. Apparently the infamous Power Glove had gyroscopic technology! Why didn't Nintendo make that more well known? Or include that technology in the Super Nintendo or something? Basically Nintendo didn't do anything with it until the Wii. But the Wii did kind of save Nintendo's but so who am I to judge? Another thing I learn is that there was a 1-800 number for gamers to call for game advice! I guess some gamers needed something like that back before the internet was around. Anyway, the movie is fun when they're actually playing games which is about 5 to 10 percent of the movie. So yeah.

The difference between a very long commercial and this film is that this film's creators decided to surround the commercial with an uninteresting story about a troubled boy who wants to go to California.Because the movie has to juggle the need to promote Nintendo with the need to have a story that went beyond promote Nintendo, the result is a story that feels forced and insincere with its emotional moments coupled with game scenes that never really take off because you don't really care about the characters involved in them. It's easy when you're a kid, especially back in 1989, to overlook the obvious flaws, but they're otherwise unavoidable.Almost none of the actors stood out to me with the exception of Will Seltzer, playing a villain who tries capturing Jimmy in order to bring him back to the institution from whence he came.

It is also incredibly cheesy, even as 80 kids films go.But then on the other hand, this film has an odd goofy nature that really shows when it was from. It also contains some interesting and funny lines and memorable scenes, many which are spoken to or referenced today, for better or for worse.If you did not know, this film in general concerns a young group of kids trying to go to a video game championship themselves. There is an underlying plot, but why spoil anything else here? This film is bad but in a good way. It has just enough charm to prevent it from being bad.

It is a great trip down memory lane, a blast from the past, a reminder of all things late 80s and early 90s, and a shameless Nintendo promo. It isn't a work of art, a plausible scenario, or even a decent movie by its own standards.If you were born before 1994, this movie is pretty much a love letter to ye olden days when Nintendo was king of the living room and emotional strife was brewing in 9/10 American families. This has all the components of a story that could draw in kids at the time. Our story features Corey (Fred Savage) who steals away with his younger and emotionally disturbed brother Jimmy (Luke Edwards) to escape the mounting tension of their family that is falling apart around them. Along the way they encounter a feisty red-headed girl named Haley (Jenny Lewis) and discover that Jimmy has a natural talent for playing video games and beating anyone that he faces. Soon they devise a plan to escape to L.A. to compete in a video game contest for $50,000 and in doing so prove that Jimmmy isn't a lost cause and possibly saving their family in the process. However, they have to dodge the boys' father and older brother (played by Beau Bridges and Christan Slater), a kid bounty hunter, and beat the competition.Yeah, the plot is seemingly ridiculous, and it really is. At one point the kids resort to hustling money in arcades to pay for their cross country trip. Then they encounter the a 13 year old boy who lives by himself and only plays video games for sustenance (with the aid of the Power Glove) who plays the evil foil for the main characters. And finally, they go into a casino complete with preteen girls in full showgirl uniform selling concessions.As mentioned before, this is for people who were kids and remember the Nintendo Era in all its splendor. If you missed this gem growing up or don't care at all, you won't change your mind and should avoid this corny rose-tinted film at all costs. But if you want to inject some nostalgia into your eyes or haven't seen this since you were a kid, rent it off Amazon or track down a copy and have a laugh. We were dumb kids.

Today's kids aren't going to want to watch this film simply because it's old. Even I, a retro-Nintendo fan, was bored throughout most of this film.Reason being why this film was so big at the time was because kids everywhere were in love with the Nintendo Entertainment System, and wanted to see and play anything to do with it. Plus, not only was it a movie with some games referenced in it, it also had the sneak peek of Super Mario Bros. 3. I can't imagine the looks on a child's face as they saw some early footage of one of the greatest games in video game history. It's things like that juice-up the nostalgia meter, but don't do much to juice-up the likability of the film.The story is about two boys, Corey (Savage) and his brother Jimmy (Edwards), who run away from their parents after a family fights consume the house. Jimmy suffers from a serious mental condition, and remains silent for most of the film. Corey realizes that Jimmy is a wizard at video games. He seems pretty calm about his skills as well, and they soon meet up with Haley (Lewis), another runaway who tells them about Video Armageddon, a big video game event that showcasing player's skill. Suddenly, they are en route to it.The Wizard's main problem is it is overly written and completely unrealistic, but I think that is what most kids will like about it. Home Alone was very over-the-top, but kids like it because the unlikely happened. Same thing happens with The Wizard. Though too many times these kids are put into serious danger, that no kid would escape. I find it incredibly hard to believe young kids aren't victim to trouble or abduction when they wander the streets aimlessly as runaways escaping kidnappers like they do it all the time.Every kid who saw this film came for the video game footage. Not the actual storyline. There are parts in the film where games are shown, saying they are on level three or something, when really, it's plain obvious to the character when they are on level. Any kid who was a huge fan of these games was most likely yelling in the theater hey, he's not on level three, and frankly, if I was eight in 1989 I probably would've too.The film focuses too much on a senseless, congested storyline when it could be focusing on trying to construct more video game footage for the kids. If you told a child, around eight or nine years old, that this film as going to show five seconds of Super Mario Bros., they wouldn't bite. If you market the film like it centers around that game, then kids would bite. Nintendo could've banked from this a lot more had they simply gave kids what they wanted. It disappoints all around.Watching the end scene in 2011 doesn't really mean much now, because Super Mario Bros. 3 can now be bought for a few dollars off of Amazon, or at any retro-game used store. All I could think was how many kids screamed at the screen when they saw this come up so abruptly. That's all The Wizard is good for now. Memories, imagining, and nostalgia. Those three things only make for a paper-thin film.Starring Fred Savage, Luke Edwards, Jenny Lewis, and Christian Slater. Directed by Todd Holland. "},{"Title":"I love The Wizard.

I seriously didn't even remember Christian Slater was in it, nor Beau Bridges (who is terrible pretending he knows how to play Nintendo, flailing at the buttons as he does). And the girl who co-stars is Jenny Lewis, now one of today's greatest musicians, heading the band Rilo Kiley as well as having a fantastic solo career. I would never have recognized her.

The Wizard is a lousy movie, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine. Directed by Todd Holland, the movie reminds me of Wonder Years meets 'Rain Man' with Nintendo. The Wizard also known as Joy Stick Heroes, Sweet Road, The Video Game Genius, Game Over and Gameboy in other countries is an adventure comedy-drama film about three children who decide to runaway to California after the death of a family member. The weak main plot is undermined, by the superior sub-plot of one of the children, Jimmy Woods (Luke Edwards), while being emotionally withdrawn, has a useful skill in video games. He's so good, that he's allow to take part of a video game tournament. This 20% part of the film, brings most of the entertaining value; while the other 80% is under par. The whole emotional depth of Jimmy trying to overcome his grief for his sister, is truly not develop, right. That plot is not emotion enough, to care about, and nearly forgotten over the superior entertaining video game sub-plot. The jokes with Jimmy's father, Sam (Beau Bridges) & older brother, Nick (Christian Slater) trying to reach the children, first, between Putnam (Will Seltzer), a greedy and sleazy runaway-child bounty hunter does, is pretty awful and unfunny. Why are both groups sabotaging each other's efforts? Isn't the child well-being more important than this childish badgering? Why is the adults in this film, acting like children, while the children is acting more like adults? Most of the humor are really bad in this film. A young girl loudly accusing the man of molesting her is supposed to be funny? Not funny. Not funny at all. Lots of unrealistic kid movie moments that kinda hurt the film, a bit. How could a 9-year-old boy walk miles along a desert highway without being noticed? I doubt the kids would find enough old rich people playing video games to gambling against. It's not like today, where video games have more appeal to an older generation that lived through video games eras like Atari. Games were pretty mediocre, in graphics and story back then. I doubt many adults played video games at the time. The Wizard is famous for its numerous references to video games and accessories for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Power Glove is one of those scenes that make the product look amazing; while in truth, the power glove is indeed truly bad. It doesn't even work, most of the time with it hard to control difficulty. Playing the game, Rad Racer on it, isn't easy at all! The film was also well known for the debut of Super Mario Bros. 3. The whole game tournament was indeed tense. Still, it was a bit odd for Jimmy to find a cheap code on a yet to debut game. Honestly, how did he know where to find the warp levels? There were a lot of Inaccuracies BS moments throughout this film. A good example is when Jimmy plays Double Dragon at the bus stop, Corey remarks that Jimmy scored 50,000 points. Jimmy achieved this in less than two minutes of play when in reality it would take playing through nearly the entire game to do so, which would take much more time. Nearly every video game that's played for any length of time in this movie is depicted incorrectly. And this as Product Placement paid for by Nintendo. It is things like this; that would turn off viewers. Still, a lot of old school gamers, would love to revisit this film as it show cast gameplay from Nintendo hits like Castlevania II Simon's Quest, Contra, Double Dragon, Mega Man 2, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden. It was a bit odd for Nintendo to showcase, some of their really crappy games as well like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Zelda II the Adventure of Link. As much, as it's nice to see somebody else, play the games well. It's well better to play it yourself. The movie is full of product placement, examples ranges from the family passes by the Cabazon Dinosaurs, a highway tourist attractions to the last part of the film taking place at Universal Studios in California. Large amounts of the time toward the end is use just to showcase extended advertisement for the studio tour. I think that one of the reasons, this movie fails. It felt like a feature length commercial than a movie. The supporting acting in the film was pretty alright at the time. Fred Savage as Jimmy's brother, Corey and Jenny Lewis as Haley were pretty good in their roles. The music by J. Peter Robinson is alright. Overall This PG-rated 97 minutes, commercial movie has maintains a cult following within the video game culture for good reasons. It's clearly not for the story, but the nostalgia factor of the games that were represented here. So check it out if you want to. Other than that. This movie is game over.

Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The kid wasn't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed. A lot of kids I knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced. On top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are bland and completely uninteresting, the 'Wizard' (the youngest child) is a very silent, completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma. It isn't that this is unrealistic, it's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes.Honestly, the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie you're going to like it whether it was good or not. It was about kids playing video games, and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the NES as well.

It's as thin as rice paper, as cheesy as a Camembert festival and as haphazardly put together as my failed Scalextric projects.Despite all this, I have a soft spot in my scaly old heart for road movies, and seeing all those ancient Nintendo games brings with it something of a warm nostalgic glow (Which is a bit odd, considering I was a Sega dude).

Apparently, my expectations were pretty low when I watched the whole film and was disappointed, but I don't think it's as bad as the critics and others say it is. It reminded me of the Nintendo Games (just Mario, apparently) that I used to play as a child back at the 90s even though this mediocre film was released in the late 80s.First, there are pros that literally saved this movie. Some of the child actors did fine with their performances and suited well for the clichéd main characters especially Fred Savage even though the kid saying, California seemed kind of shy and awkward to me. It has some nice references to some of the games (Double Dragon, and everything else along with Super Mario Brothers 3 during a contest in Universal Florida which was awesome in my opinion) and the music is pretty good too.Then, there are the cons that completely ruined the film for me. the adult actors are OK, but to me, they felt like they got bored with their roles and the villain didn't interest me at all. The worst con throughout this film is the story and boy was it boring. You know how it goes A kid got traumatized because of the death of his sister and his family is now lost after his father got divorced. However, a kid has the ability to play games and is really good at it. So, he and two other kids (his brother, played by Fred Savage) journey to other places until finally they reached Universal Florida. The beginning just showed a freaking kid walking in a valley (seriously, what kind of kind can walk in that place where his foster parents are looking for him?) and the ending was completely lame (They just traveled through different countries, entered a video game tournament in Universal Florida, just to enter another theme park where the California saying kid sees a dinosaur and puts a picture of his family on it? Come on! How extremely boring can this ending get?).Overall, The Wizard is a strictly mediocre family film. It shows great nostalgic value that reminded the audience of how much they played the Nintendo games when they were kids or teenagers which shows some great entertainment, but with a much better story, this would've been so much better.

Well, at least not exactly. This Wizard dealt with kids in peril, feeling trapped where they were. Video games were their outlet. One boy so disturbed, he became mute and later committed after witnessing the death of his sister. The older brothers living with the father after the divorce. When a child is lost, a family is too. The Wizard open with a small, determined soul walking along a long stretch of road in the pursuit of something. Some goal, some destination. Some form of escape. There's something... he's looking for. He's on his way... somewhere. Somewhere special, somewhere important. Somewhere he needs to be. It fades in like a sunrise... where is he going? We don't know. This boy's name is Jimmy. And he has a goal. He tells us, California... Jimmy, in a major institution, yet breaking loose again and again like the family cat. One day during a visit, big brother Corey takes little Jimmy and the two break loose--together. At an arcade, Corey first-hand witnesses Jimmy is Bobby Fisher's predecessor at Nintendo. They use his skills to play for money. And because it's a road trip movie, they have to pick up a woman along the way. It's a PG flick for little kids (once again, Nintendo fans), so it has to a preteen like them--and they have to be just friend. Her name is Haley, an adolescent drifter. She claims to know the score... and she can raise the money to get them where they need to go. And Halley is one sizzling hustler. Wait 'til she's old enough to develop sex appeal to add to the mix. It was my mother who recalled that old song from the He's A Pinball Wizard by The Who and suggested maybe that's where the movie got its namesake. The little ditty of some soul who was a wonder at that one arcade game. It was his world. Whoever he was. Well, if anyone could relate to that... 'Would've liked to hear that on the soundtrack at maybe some point. A lot of the world said that the Wizard is stuffed to the gills with commercials. But no, they were wrong. The Wizard WAS a commercial. For Nintendo and Universal. If we'd gotten scenes where we see Jimmy's connection to these games, how he becomes Zen, there might have actually been some real significance. We're just watching video games being played. And... that's all we as kids wanted from The Wizard. No really powerful piece of cinema, but to just see kids like us running loose without parental supervision and Nintendo being our source of rebellion. Children as resourceful as can be doing incredible things with the toys we played with and loved. Screenwriter/producer David Chisholm seems to have cobbled this together out of spare plot threads and gimmicks. Usually filmmakers do this when they're just doing the obligated rush hatchet job and don't have their heart in the project they're working on. And you can tell--Chisholm doesn't love this screenplay of his. This is no personal project for him. This is just a Hollywood crowd-pleaser designed to feed the cult masses. The choir (us) loves video games, lives for them, thrives on them. But the makers of this movie don't. They don't care about any of this except--Here, buy this. Spend your money on... For all of those who belonged to the mass cult of Nintendo, this was the third coming. Seeing it again now with older, more experienced eyes... like an old man going back into his childhood home, the bedroom we once lived in, the bed once ours, looking over our own toys and photos... and, and... what the hell was I thinking? Was that even me? Who was that?What is Wizard? A film of our adoration for Nintendo from our childhood, which weaved together our love of movies featuring us kids as the heroes and our undying love of the video games. ... Jesus, what were we thinking? Fred Savage stands as one of the finest child actors there ever was. The Savage was just that--even better. And Luke Edwards is all right for what this role calls for--acting terminally shy at all times. For a movie about the kids and their toys, The Wizard holds some surprisingly good adult performances. Steven Grives as the electrified Video Armageddon Announcer who's like a British Christopher Lloyd as the charged-up Master of Ceremonies. And Will Seltzer as one scummy bounty hunter who tracks down runaways. Beau Bridges, commendable. Christian Slater himself, a fine actor, very fine. Like fine china. And he's given virtually nothing to do in his eldest brother role. Hey, the kids don't care about Bridges or Christian Slater--they care about Nintendo. Well, there's not much Nintendo either. For some reason, after seeing The Wizard again with older eyes, I just somehow didn't feel like video games for the time being. I wanted to get out and physically do something. Take some real action with my life. It was a few days before I picked up a Game Boy.

My sister and I were both born in the 1980's and both had a Nintendo system of course. So I decided to go ahead and check out this movie, it seemed sort of like a nostalgic movie that represented out simple time of Super Mario Brothers. Not knowing what this film was about, just that it had a lot of Nintendo games in it, I wasn't sure what to expect. But I'm sure that maybe when the film came out, it had a lot of high expectations, but it was a let down as this story is a bit odd. I don't know who wrote the script, but these kids that star in the movie don't talk or act like kids at all, at least that I could remember I never talked like that with my friends. Then the adults act like a bunch of immature kids, the way some of these people behave, you're surprised they're not in a mental institution. But somehow, I don't know why, I liked this movie. It's one of those movies that I can't explain why, I just enjoyed the film.Jimmy is a young boy who has been in a silent mode since his twin sister drowned in a river. He doesn't interact with anyone, spending most of his time building things out of blocks or boxes, and he always carries his lunch pail with him. He's determined go to California.Jimmy's condition has broken up his family he lives with his mother and stepfather, while his half-brothers Corey and Nick live with their father Sam. When Jimmy is put into an institution, Corey breaks him out and runs away with him to California. Jimmy's mother and stepfather hire Putnam, runaway child hunter, who competes with Corey's father and older brother to find the boys and sabotage each other's efforts. Along the way, they meet a girl named Haley, who is on her way home to Reno. Discovering that Jimmy has an innate skill at playing video games, Haley tells them about Video Armageddon, a video game tournament with a cash prize of $50,000. She then agrees to help the two reach Los Angeles. By doing so, they hope to prove that Jimmy doesn't need to live in an institution.The story is a bit tedious at times, our little weirdo kid Jimmy doesn't exactly have the charm to win over the audience's heart as he's a bit too strange with his deliverance of the line Califooooneeea, heck, even Arnold Schwartzenegger says California more believable than Jimmy. Also, I know the child hunter Puntman is a sleaze bag, but why is he a villain? The dad and brother are constantly getting into unrealistic fights with him that are almost deadly, they slash each other's car tires, they crash into each other's cars, they try to shatter each other's windows, it's a bit too disturbing what they go through just so they could say who got to the kids first. The Wizard was just a big Nintendo promotion to buy all the newest video games, including their newest at the time Super Mario Brothers 3(one of the most awesome video games of all time I have to say), also a promotion of Universal Studios that wasn't too subtle. But still, again, through all that's bad, I think this film has a good time and had good intentions over all. It's nothing too memorable, but if you are a kid of the 80's/90's I think you'll get a kick out of this movie.6/10 "},{"Title":"Memories","Date":"8 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","Review":" This film was a little flat for me, but watchable.

A young boy (Luke Edwards) is literally taken out of a mental institution by his older brother (Fred Savage) with no one knowing until it is too late. Edwards is very distant and seems to have autistic tendencies. They decide to go to California to get Edwards in a national Nintendo tournament. Along the way they meet up with youngster Jenny Lewis and together the trio slowly advances to their destination. Soon Beau Bridges (the boys' father) and Christian Slater (their older brother) set out to find them. Of course they are in a race against time with Bridges' ex-wife (Wendy Phillips) and her husband (Sam McMurray) and also with super-slimy private investigator Will Seltzer. The big conflict for Savage and company is a brash video-gamer (Jackey Vinson) and his group of adolescent cronies (which includes Tobey Maguire if you look real hard) who are trying to keep our heroes out of the video game competition.

The NES was a major success, kids everywhere were filled with joy playing such greats such as the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros, and Nintendo was raking in the cash. While the Super Mario Bros Movie is the prime example of Nintendo butchering video game franchises in order to bring them to the big screen, one movie in 1989 was unlike all the others The Wizard.The film begins with a mentally-unstable 6 year old boy named Jimmy. It soon becomes apparent that Jimmy wants to go to California (VERY APPARENT), so his 13 year old half-brother Corey (Fred Savage) steals him from the mental institution, and they're on their way. As an interesting side note, Ben Savage plays a character named Corey on Boy Meets World while Fred Savage plays a different Corey in The Wizard. Confusing. Anyway, Corey's dad (Beau Bridges) and brother (Christian Slater) start on a mission to find the children while competing with a children-finder, who is not nearly as pant-wetting freaky as the child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, to get them first. It may seem simple on the exterior, but the plot starts to not make much sense when trying to figure out the family connections between all the characters since Jimmy is the product of one marriage and Corey and&#x85;..screw it. Along the way, the duo meets up with Hailey, who convinces them into competing in Video Armageddon, a video game tournament in none other than California.Now, in any great movie there is a great adversary, right? Well of course, and The Wizard is no exception. So, who will be standing in Jimmy's path to video game domination? Lucas Barton, the greatest video gamer in all the land. I really don't know what the creators were thinking when they created this laughable excuse for a villain, but for some odd reason, it actually works. It gives the film a unique sort of feel, and even though it's dated and immature, it's a load of fun.Besides confusing the crap out of an 8 year old with the attention span of a rodent, what other problems does the film have? Got 3 hours to spare? First of all, the morals are all screwed up. The film essentially preaches that hitchhiking is the best plan for 6 and 13 year olds, gambling is great for all ages, screaming about being raped in public to get someone is arrested is fine even if you're just messing around, never reprimand your kids for running away, charge as much money to a hotel room you can't pay for as possible, eat food that isn't yours, sell your parent's bus ticket for some video games&#x85;&#x85;I think the point has been made. I am not even going to discuss the I'm sleeping with my father in a dump on the highway or the 80-year old man in a thong ordering liquor. Seriously, what the hell were they thinking? Thankfully, the soundtrack to The Wizard is about as 80's as possible, and for a fan of music from that decade, it's a true joy to listen to. While all the bands that performed songs for the film have ling been forgotten, rocking tunes such as Send Me an Angel are featured in some great montage sequences that add a unique style to the overall experience. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie is the actual filming locations in the movie. The vast majority of the flick showcases Jimmy and Corey hitchhiking from Utah to California, so seeing all the beautiful scenery and open areas is a real treat.There are great movies, there are terrible movies, and then there is The Wizard. I truly don't know how to even classify it since, yes, it is a plot disaster, yet it's enormously entertaining and interesting. I have seen this flick more times over the years than I can even count, and watching it today still gives me a sense of satisfaction and joy.

The movie was not a success by Hollywood standards, but the film helped push SMB3's popularity over the edge into a full-on mania.  The film was also an advertisement for the Nintendo World Championships that was to tour the country around the same time.  (Yes, I went- made it to the semi-finals at least.)  In response to a reviewer who thought it was dumb that the movie showed people traveling across country to play video games... umm- it happened.  I was beat, in Indianapolis, by a guy from New York (and he lost to Thor Aackerlund, another traveller, at the end of the tournament.)  When talking to the kid who beat me, I found out that he had participated in every NWC that had taken place so far.  The movie, as a movie, sucks.  There is no other proper description.  It's a trite kid's movie, and is as bad as Mac and Me or Slappy and the Stinkers.  The actors are all way out of place- anyone could have filled their roles, and the same effect would have been achieved.  The only reason to see this theatrically was to see SMB3 in action, and to get the promotional special-edition digest-sized Nintendo Power that theaters gave to patrons.  (Similar to the special edition given away at the NWCs... hmm, I sense a pattern.)So- I trashed the movie.  Why do I own it? It's a video game movie, and one of the only ones from the late 80's.

Tron, The Last Starfighter, Cloak & Dagger, Tilt (okay- it's pinball), Joysticks, Arcade... this type of movie has been supplanted by movies based around people getting sucked into virtual reality games (just how many people even PLAY vr games?).  The Wizard is one of this genre of film that will probably never really come back... I'm an old-school gamer, and own everything from a Pong to a PSX, plus arcade games and PCs galore.  The Wizard may not be very good, but it is one of the few documents of the late 80's video game scene- and for that, it's priceless. "},{"Title":"i love the power glove....

A son who heals and a father who connects with his children.........yeah...So it's basically a shameless plug for Nintendo, but who cares? I for one can remember that after seeing this film, I treated every video game I played for a number of years later as an epic experience.Coming up to a machine, putting my quarters in, and staring at the glass with the intensity of a hawk. I was the man. I was the Wizard...Sadly though, if you weren't alive in a time when The N.E.S. was king, then this movie probably wont mean that much for you. Now it is a stroll down memory lane. A simpler time of 8 bit graphics, and the premier of the greatest Super Mario game ever.Don't go into this looking for a life changing experience. For all intent and purposes it's not really that great of a film. To a 7 year old who lived it however, it was the end all be all to films.I can't really go much into this film cause as I said, it was something that was for it's time. Today with Halo III a month away from release, and a world of Wii's, 360's, and PS3, the charm that this movie once had has long since faded into a pile of ash.The life that this film had has gone beyond the wall-mart bargain bin, and will forever live in the hearts and minds of 2nd Gen gamers (I say 2nd gen cause technically the Nintendo/Sega years were a resurgence from the Commodore/Atari years).I would say that if you have never seen this movie and you are under the age of say 24, then please be kind. Remember that this movie was not for you. It was for us. Us gamers who thought that 16 colors was a artisans palette. Us who remember the joy's of opening Mario Brother III and feeling the excitement of a Mario that could fly, and knowing that the reign of the N.E.S. was about to give way to the new kid on the block, the S.N.E.S. Us who remember what a real console war was.Nothing personal to anyone, but it is certainly the truth...

I had a Nintendo, and loved the fact that we were going to get a look at Super Mario 3.For a twelve year old the action was awesome, the romance between Fred Savage and Jenny Lewis was jaw dropping, plus the gambling in Reno and the final tournament.Now I see it was just a glorified commercial for Universal Studios and Nintendo, even though it had Christian Slater in it. I still love the film for the nostalgia, like the power glove and the games like Ninja Gaiden, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and especially Super Mario Bros. 3. If you are around my age rent it for your kids, and you will probably find yourself watching it as well.

Fred Savage runs away with his autistic like brother off to California to play in a video game tournament. If you want to remember how cool it was to play Nintendo, watch this movie.         The fun parts of this movie was watching how dysfunctional the single father was. After witnessing this film I would never allow kids to return to a father like that. Another fun bit with this movie was with Fred's love interest. During the movie she accuses a character of being a child molestor to escape from her capture. That's some pretty odd slap stick.

I guess it all depends on the age you were when it came out, and whether you had or played the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).I was 11 when the movie was released, and my 7 year old brother and I dragged our mother to the theatre to let us see it.  I could relate to all the games they were playing, and of course, got my first glimpse at Super Mario Brothers 3, probably the best game ever for the NES.The story was simple enough to follow at that age, and provided plenty of action and drama for us.  Yes, the plot and acting are not oscar-calibre, but it never tried to be.  And of course this movie is filled with shameless product placement, but who cares when you're 11?Looking back now, I would probably find the movie too dated, lightweight, and commercial, but I am 13 years older.  The only people who would appreciate this movie would today be around 19-29.  If you tried to show it to anyone else, including kids of today, they wouldn't like it at all. Like I said, you either love it or hate it.

The high point of the movie would have to be just before the worst movie line ever. just keep your Power Gloves off her, pal. Once uttered, this phrase caused the movie to plummet into a downward spiral, eventually coming to rest in the so bad it's funny category alongside other titles such as Santa with Muscles or Deathsport.

I didn't own a NES at the time, but all my friends did, and I was miserable. (Eventually, I did get a NES. Then I got a SNES, then a computer, the Internet and my brain rotted.) Anyway, I rented this film and I actually liked it a lot, when I was five. Then I saw it again recently. My feelings have changed a lot since then.This movie is about a kid (Fred Savage) who accompanies his retarded cousin (or brother... I forget) to California to participate in a Nintendo competition. A girl also follows them around. The whole plot is sappy, but it's in an OK road-movie format. A lot of the dialogue went right over my head (you know, the Street Fighter stuff...) as well as the overall cheesiness of this film. What mostly appealed to me (as a five year old) was the fact that everyone was playing Nintendo. But now, in the era of kids with cellphones and multimedia, this may be lost. I don't think anyone except those under 7 (right now) or who was a Nintendo freak during that time will enjoy this movie. 5/10 (for kids and Nintendo freaks) 3/10 for the rest.

Hence, a movie. This film, and I use the term loosely, is a re-hash of The Who's Tommy, minus the interesting characters, trippy visuals, and mind-bending music. This is the type of movie that defined the Saturday Morning Cartoon generation of the 1980s, with its blatant commercialism and poor production. So we have classicly horrid dialogue like, The Power Glove(tm). It's so bad..., kids fawning over some (now) classic video games, and some *really* inept adults, as were found in most eighties movies, especially the John Hughes Brat Pack flicks.

For some reason they get on my nerves and as such I can't particularly feel anything for the lead protagonist, the ever bothersome Jimmy.Be afraid.  Very afraid.
