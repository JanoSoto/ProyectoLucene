[{"Title":"Sick...demented...hilarious!!!!!","Date":"19 September 2002","Score":"70 out of 89 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Screw all those crappy reviews!  This is a wonderful film!  First of all, I was hoping to one day see a movie about the actors behind a children's TV show who are completely nuts in real life.  Well, I got my wish.  I would say that Adam Resnick (the writer) stole my idea, but I had no exact thoughts on where to go with the premise.  Well, Resnick went really far with this wonderful premise and in result we have this dark, alluring, hilarious comedy!The cast is absolutely topnotch!  I read one review slamming Edward Norton's performance in the film, saying that he phoned in his performance.  Sure, his performance in this film doesn't QUITE measure up to those in Primal Fear and Rounders, but he did one hell of a job, and I can tell he researched the role very well to the point where he completely disappeared into the character.  Whether it's a dramatic or comedic role, Norton always immerses himself in his roles.  Though you can classify him as the straight man in this wacky satire, he says and does a lot of things that had me cracking up, without any humorous intentions.  The only thing that disappointed me slightly was that Robin Williams didn't have as big a role as I expected.  In the first 45 minutes, we only see him intermittently. Actually, Norton really has the starring role and if Robin weren't a more popular actor, he probably would've been billed first.  Norton's one of my favorite actors, but I believe if you're gonna bill an actor as the star, he better be the star!  But Robin Williams was still in top form.  Catherine Keener is beautiful, yet entirely convincing as an ego-driven TV executive. Jon Stewart doesn't have too many funny scenes, but his goofy Jerry Lewis haircut was enough to make me crack up.  Danny Woodburn--Mickey from Seinfeld--shows off his fine acting skills, playing more than just the little guy.  The always-amusing Vincent Schiavelli makes a few appearances towards the end.  Michael Rispoli is both hilarious and likable as the simple-minded ex-fighter, Spinner.  Danny DeVito proves yet again that his skills behind the camera match his talents in front of the camera.I don't suppose Death to Smoochy will be receiving any major Oscars, but it should at least be nominated for Best Art Direction.  The sets, lighting and color pallette are absolutely incredible.  As grim as it is, it's a beautiful film to look at.This is an R-rated comedy with a well-deserved R.  There's tons of profanity and some truly crude (though not disgusting, thankfully) sex gags. If you're in the mood for an old-fashioned, Cary Grant-type screwball comedy--you will be sorely appalled.  Nevertheless, the humor is smart and witty, just drenched in cynicism.  When Norton was doing the show and pulled out a cookie shaped like a man's genitals and Robin started screaming at the kids what it really is, I was dying with laughter.  You may not feel good about laughing at some of these jokes, but the sense of humor doesn't lie. But as cynical as it is, I didn't feel the movie was mean-spirited. Because I'm often turned off by mean-spirited comedies.  I guess it's because as scummy as these characters prove to be, there's at least one redeeming quality about each of them.  Sure, Rainbow Randolph is a loud, obnoxious drunk.  He lost his TV show.  They snatched his dream, because of one little bribery slip-up.  So he's not a saint.  Is Mister Rogers a saint?  As far as we know, but how do we know for sure he wasn't in the same theater as Pee Wee Herman, disguised in a fake moustache and beard, pleasuring himself as well?  Whatever the public don't know can't hurt them.I was glad to see that the movie averaged a 6.9 rating on the IMDB.  I was expecting a rating much lower, after its poor box office records and countless bad reviews from major critics.  Well, I had a blast!  It's an energetic, upbeat, fun-filled journey with a ton of laughs.  I surely hope it one day reaches cult status.  And the sequence over the closing credits is perfectly delightful.  If you love Robin Williams and think he's one of the funniest men in the planet, if you're a fan of the great Edward Norton, if you think Catherine Keener is really hot, if you think Danny DeVito is a genius or if you simply wanna have a barrel of laughs--Death to Smoochy will keep you alive with pleasure.My score  7 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"An Original Adult Comedy","Date":"1 October 2002","Score":"52 out of 63 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Death to Smoochy pushes the envelope of comedy, only to fail because it couldn't find the right audience.

Entertainment programs for children that are turned into big business, rules and controlled by people who don't care about anything but money, fame and commercializing. Death to Smootch shows how it's perfectly possible to cover up a world of bribery, fraud and blackmail behind the curtains of a colorful and jolly kid-show. Edward Nortons stars as Smoochy the Rhino. His character is dragged head over heals into the business when old-timer Rainbow Randolph is convicted of illegal actions. Smoochy is a pure character and his only intentions are to educate children and enlighten them with some important values of life, but he soon gets faced with the facts that the producers don't care about this at all. Death to Smoochy really succeeds in critisizing the greed in the media-business and manages to portray the producers and sponsors as a real bunch of vultures. It also gives a good image of the downward spiral of insanity someone is going through when he's borne down on the lee shore. Certainly recommended for the intriguing story and surrounding but in the very first place, for the brilliant characters that are involved in this story. The Irish mobsters impress and entertain the most...The sequences where they're taking care of everything are the funniest parts in this movie. Director DeVito (his fifth movie as a director and maybe the best of them all) cast himself terrifically as the greedy shorty who introduces himself as the new impresario. Jon Stewart's character is memorable because he has the dorkiest haircut I've ever seen. And then there's Edward Norton of course...needless to say that he's a very solid actor who acts like a true professional, no matter if the production is huge or not. Give Death to Smoochy a watch...it'll certainly be one of the most sparklingly satires you'll ever see.

I say that because of the humor is sick, mainly the tirades spouted by Robin Williams (especially with kids nearby). Otherwise, this black comedy offers a really wonderful character as the lead good guy Smoochy the Rhino, played well by Edward Norton. How Norton could deliver some of these lines with a straight face is beyond me. He must have required numerous takes. He's a real hoot in here.Despite what you might have read from national critics, there are a lot of laughs in this film. I also thought the cinematography was interesting with vivid, fascinating colors and some nice closeup shots. For a comedy, I don't expect photography to be as good as it is in here. Kudos to the director and cinematographer.Williams, as the bitter dethroned kiddies TV host,  'Rainbow' Randolph Smiley, is, well.....Robin Williams, which means very profane and very funny. I expect that sort of profanity out of him, and he gets away with it here and there because of his great comedic talent, but I hate to hear it from female leads who are supposed to be likable. That's the case with Catherine Keener, who seems to play a lot of these hard-looking, foul- mouthed women.....although Smoochy finally softens her up by the end of this story.At any rate, you have to appreciate black comedy and this kind of almost-perverse humor, to like this movie.

I can understand that some people didn't like it, as black comedy isn't for everyone; especially black comedy set around the business of children's television. But Death to Smoochy is an intelligent and well written film that is completely original.Edward Norton is spot on as the moralistic Sheldon Mopes and Robin Williams is absolutely hilarious as the off the rails Rainbow Randolph. This doesn't however, take away from the rest of the cast, who are also all perfect.The story line is tight and entertaining to the very last second. I've looked very hard to find fault with this film - and I can't find any. Even the ending, which could be construed as sugary sweet, fits into the fantasy type world of the film.The important thing to remember about this film is that it's a satire, and taking a satire seriously is a big mistake. A funny and interesting satire is very hard to do, but in this instance it's something that Adam Resnick and Danny Danny DeVito have achieved brilliantly.

And also the characters in 'War of the Roses' were thoroughly over-the-top, but it was because of this that the films directed by the short man were so entertaining.'Death to Smoochy' was no exception. It is because of the over-the-top characters that it is so funny. Edward Norton's character in particular is hilarious just because of the OTT reactions the 'atrocities' of the world draw out of him, and the overly-nice attitude he oozes.There are other things that create humour. The lines are hilariously witty and even the facial expressions created by some of the characters give the film replay value. So IS there anything wrong with it?I, personally, don't believe the dated storyline creates an obstruction, but I do feel that there is a problem with the dramatic character arcs. The biggest example of this is Robin Williams' character who goes, in one scene, from being ridiculously hateful, to wanting nothing more than to save his ex-arch-rival. This is where the over-the-top obstructs believability, although it doesn't do enough to make me dislike the film even partially.The film, although flawed only by the very dramatic character arcs, is thoroughly enjoyable, and DeVito sprinkles just enough dramatic camera angles to support the extremity of the storyline. It is a rare gem, battered at the box office, but very safe in my collection of favourite DVDs.Enjoy.-Stoate.

Talk about totally hilarious.Some of the gags in this film were quality - Robin Williams is at his comical best.

In fact, i've never laughed this much since Dumb and Dumber.Edward Norton was actually very believable as the clean cut good guy. I didn't expect it from him after watching Fight club and American history X but he carried out his role really well.Catherine Keener also looked really beautiful, she played her power-hungry turned nice chick character to a tee.Even though the story is about a kids show, there's a lot of dark comedy in it e.g. the involvement of the Irish gangsters (by the way also very funny) showing what a good job Danny devito has done directing this film.

All seemed believable and Robin Williams was the star.If you watch this film, persevere for the first 20 minutes because after which the jokes and plot come in hard and thick.Top stuff, rent if you want a comedy with original storyline and a little bit of good humoured smut thrown in for good measure.

He makes meticulously crafted films, so finely designed that they really impress. These are fine products at the technical level with lots of cinematic tricks. They are also finely conceived in terms of the narrative placement. Heck, one of his films revolves around a Nabokov novel. But like Zappa, all that craft is deliberately hidden under an unappealing, inhuman noise.In this case, its the narrative conception that makes this worth while. I say that even though I am dying to report that at long last Williams, poor man, has a role that fits.That narrative structure relies on a currently popular device of plays about plays. Here, it is a film about an ice show about a TeeVee show. All three are equally abstract and stylized; all three an equal `distance' from the viewer. But unlike Lynch or Depalma or Greenaway, the casual viewer has no problem sorting out which is which. That's because of the talented Keener and how DeVito uses her as our surrogate. Walking through this, we have a fight over the TeeVee show in which a fighter in `real life' is murdered.We have essential nazis controlling the TeeVee show, disrupted by `real' Nazis which are a threat to the player and which he turns around in the iceshow parody. (This is a nod to Brooks and his similarly structured `The Producers.')Watch this. It lacks the inviting warmth in which many films wrap themselves, in fact it pokes a stick right in that tradition. But it is intelligent in both cinematic and literate ways.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4 Worth watching.

DTS throws out most of the conventional comedy mold and attempts to do something different and off the wall. The cast is also a great ensemble, including Edward Norton, Robin Williams, Catherine Keener, and Danny DeVitto among others.The problem for me was the delivery of the humor just didn't work. DTS relies too much on the uniqueness of itself to generate laughs. A theoretically good concept can't make up for the lack of substance of the greater product. The movie just drags on and on for nearly two hours, despite barely having enough humorous material to fill half that time. The only scene that I really found memorable was Robin Williams's rant about a certain phallic shaped cookie.Maybe I'm overlooking some deep inner meaning or something, but for me this film just didn't work and while some will no doubt like it for being different, it's a tough sell.

It certainly bears the slightly warped touch of director Danny DeVito, who surrounds himself with like minded performers such as Robin Williams, Edward Norton and Jon Stewart. His choice for the ice skating opera diva is also in keeping with this theme, choosing the unconventional (and somewhat controversial in opera circles) Lauren Flanigan to poke fun at her genre. Although the plot centers on children's television, the language is certainly more for an adult audience, hence the R rating. By the way, a note to the Julliard School's Alumni Association, rumors of Ms. Flanigan's demise, as listed in your latest directory, are grossly exaggerated. "},{"Title":"Dated already.

With the sleaze hurting the studio, the execs look for the cleanest replacement they can find - enter one Sheldon Mopes aka Smoochy the Rhino.  Sheldon's clean cut approach rubs some of the execs up the wrong way as they try to push the usual marketing stuff through.  While he makes enemies within the studio, Rainbow Randolph is fuming and planning to destroy Smoochy and get his show back.I really wanted to love this simply because I am one of the few people in the UK who will have bothered to see this film since the collapse of FilmFour and poor US box office pretty much meant it barely reached video stores here.  However the overall film doesn't really manage to do what it sets out to do.  The plot seemed interesting to me a few years ago when it was first released in the US, but since then it's topical edge has been lost and what is left is a basic dark comedy.  Within this there are a handful of good moments but generally it just doesn't work out; the jokes are dark to be sure, but it has far too few laughs - and not for the want of trying. The film throws in violent gags, slapstick gags, outrageous gags and so on, but too many of them slip by without eliciting laughter.The plot is looked at to provide humour simply on the basis of how `unusual' and `darkly comic' it is, but it doesn't manage to provide laughs - but it does do enough to hold the interest.  It has far too much going on and far too many characters to adequately control.  As such it loses focus and, when it ended, I was unsure what it had been trying to accomplish but knowing for sure that it had failed.  Too much is unstructured and the script would have done better to lose a lot of characters (who only exist to drive the plot occasionally) and focus on the main strands.The cast is impressive but largely poor I'm afraid to say.  Norton is a powerhouse and is one of my favourite actors as a result, but here he can't carry the whole film.  His performance is good but only on the one level - when it goes beyond the comedy hippy, he loses it.  Likewise Williams just tries to swear and shock to be funny - his best moments are the more serious moments where he is falling apart but the film doesn't allow him time to do it.  Keener has good timing and a good role and she is worth watching here, as is Stewart, although he has little screen time.  DeVito is OK as actor and his direction is good in terms of interesting shots and frames, however he can't bring it all together.  Small roles from the Schiavelli and the dreaded Fierstein don't really add a great deal - and don't even get me started on the Irish mob caricatures!Overall I have been interested in this film for about two years and had forgotten it by the time I chanced upon it in the video store.  It had some good ideas and some potential but it was lost and the result is a film that is fragmented, unsure of it's self and, sadly, not very funny in either the dark sense or the laugh-out-loud sense.  Missed by most of the UK and seen by me - and I think the majority are right on this one. "},{"Title":"Someone toss me a beach towel because my head is swimming. How is this movie, a bad movie!?

And that's why the rhino's going to get exactly what he deserves. Death to Smoochy is a mix of Barney the Dinosaur and over the top gangster films. Death to Smoochy is an acquired taste, that has since release, got a large cult follow. In no way is the movie perfect, this movie does take something so sacred like kid-televisions shows host, and turn it incredibly dark. Most of the characters are pretty unlikeable and mean-spirited, and their turn around to good, a bit far-fetch, but I have to say, that the movie isn't trying to be squeaky clean, it's trying to show that even the greater of good can still fall in the mud. The movie felt like a remake of 1939's Mr. Smith goes to Washington with its similar plot. The movie is about, a good-All American boy, named Sheldon Mopes AKA Smoochy (Edward Norton) who is hired by a network station to replace, corrupt children's television show host, Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) whom just got busted for taking bribes. It's seem like the television producers, M. Frank Stokes (Jon Stewart) & Nora Wells (Catherine Keener) charged with finding a squeaky clean replacement for Randolph, under-establish how squeaky clean, Sheldon is, as he's not willing to forsake any events that is funded by criminals such as the Parade of Hope, who hide under a charity organization. Now, Sheldon must try to keep his 'I want to do good, mentality believable, under the pressure of the harsh realism of corruption, leaded by attacks from both Rainbow Randolph, Parade of Hope, and the Network. Making a dark comedy is difficult to write, it's so easy to slip into a really depressing drama, or horror, if not handled correctly. I think the movie is well-written. It is crass, crude, and hilarious. It shows the depths of ugliness, but isn't too mean-spirited to be unlikeable. Still, whatever commentary there was supposed to be about American mass media consumerism didn't really come through right. Without the great gifted acting from both Edward Norton and Robin Williams, this movie wouldn't had work. Edward Norton's Sheldon Mopes is a lovable and friendly character that's so nice, so friendly, so naive, he played all those layers of the character so well we start to believe a guy like that can really exist! He was a bit annoying at times, but overall, he did great as the moral stone needed for this film to work. Robin Williams is just ridiculous, most of his jokes were funny as hell. This is the first role, in a long time of playing the good guy in the 1990s, that he was alright as the rude and irascible with a propensity for violence, type of a bad guy. The supporting cast was just as funny as them. I love the character of Spinner Dunn (Michael Rispoli). He was such a lovable funny character. The witty one-liners, harsh physical comedy and dark, biting tone force the audience to laugh out loud while squirming in their seats. Still, it's weird that Neo-Nazis are huge fans of a cartoony rhino. The music that goes with the film is just absurd, but great to hear; Step-father, one of Moochy's songs about being patient with mom's new husband, is pure brilliance. Even the Friends Come in All Sizes, song by Robin William is pretty impression with the opening tap dance. The whole ice dance event toward the end was very well-done. I got buzzed off of orange juice watching it. Death to Smoochy is known for its outwardly vulgar and profane humor, particularly Williams' profound cursing outbursts throughout the film. I wouldn't say, this movie should be watch, by children, at all. It was unfair of critics to call it one of the worst of the year. Overall Death to Smoochy is screwed up satire, but in a squeamishly delightful kind of way. Plus, for those of you who harbor a secret, pent-up, homicidal hatred of Barney, will love this movie. Death to Smoochy can't change the world but it did made a dent in some people lives. I was surprised to find that this film has so many rabid fans.

First, Smoochy gives a dark twist to children's TV programming and especially to children's charities, portraying them more as crime syndicates than do-good organizations. In one scene, Sheldon (Ed Norton), who is Smoochy the Rhino, declines to do an ice show, thus cutting off expected revenues to a well known children's charity. He is severely warned, They are the roughest of all the charities.Ed Norton is superb. You first meet an impossibly sincere, saccharine character who sits at a bar drinking orange juice spiked with liquid alfalfa---and gets buzzed. And you believe him. But, there are a couple of moments when he reveals the potential for insensate rage, and you learn that one time in his life he had to learn anger management, thus giving an entirely different spin to the character.Norton is exquisitely supported by all the others. Catherine Keener is a revelation. Early in the movie, Nora (Keener) is a hard-bitten TV exec who puts Sheldon (Norton)in his place, I didn't discover you. I delivered you. I have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish.Later, she reveals a vulnerable woman who was used and hurt by the cads all around her in the children's TV business. Rebuffing Rainbow Randolph's (Robin Williams) suggestion they take up where they left off, years ago, Nora ripostes,Nora I was young. And stupid.

What would a lecherous, heroine-addicted clown, hired to assassinate another clown, look like? He would look like Buggy Ding Dong. You have to see him to believe it. You will burst out laughing.That the critics hated this movie brings up what I call the Bulworth effect, which I first noticed around 1998, when that awful movie came out. So, Bulworth is to movies what shoe leather is to filet mignon. But for the young Halle Barry, Bulworth would be unwatchable. However, it is politically correct, and that is the only possible explanation for the raves it got from critics.Death To Smoochy is politically very INcorrect. And that is the only possible explanation for the hammering it got from critics. If you have ever wondered why your own impressions of a movie differ so greatly from that of the critics, politics is the likely explanation. Movies like Death To Smoochy and Bulworth make it very clear that many of the critics are looking at the movies for something other than a great story and great acting.

With a misleading trailer boasting a broad comedy Robin Williams vehicle, the film was greeted as a scornful box office failure that few seemed to know how to approach and proved miles away from what they had expected. Yet this reaction proves all the more disappointing considering the rare treat the film offers - one of a steadily decreasing few which genuinely subvert viewer expectations. While far from perfect, Death to Smoochy remains the sort of fundamentally bizarre yet gloriously daring picture which seldom makes it to theatres, offering a gleefully warped, macabre wit almost guaranteed to please those willing to take it for what it is.The fact that the word 'death' being present in the title of a mainstream comedy is a rarity should be indicative of exactly how offbeat and downright sinister the film is. Despite a sparkly visual palate of pastel colours, the film could hardly be more dark tonally, with its infusion of frequent brutal violence and sadistic, uncomfortable humour making it about the farthest thing away from the safe, mainstream comedy its trailer attempted to depict. Yet its shady sensibilities cannot possibly quench the film's manic, wickedly sadistic wit, and the enormously quotable screenplay delivers such a varied slew of humour that the viewer cannot help but consistently be caught by surprise. DeVito amplifies such an ambiance with bizarre, off-kilter camera-work and a continuous transitioning from satire to the deadly serious to goofy slapstick and back again, leaving the viewer uncertain when to roar with laughter or to cringe uncomfortably. In fact, the blurring between the two becomes poignantly indiscernible, with DeVito seemingly impishly suggesting that whether cinema makes us laugh or cringe, either way it does not deter our fascination with watching, and that perhaps the boundary becomes simply redundant in the end. Nonetheless, as fresh as such a fusion of the comedic and the grotesque may be, the lack of obvious prerequisites also results in Death to Smoochy suffering from certain design flaws. The film starts off as a devilish satire of network television, with Norton's sickeningly wholesome entertainer Sheldon Mopes thrust into the fish out of water figure in a sea full of greedy, merchandise obsessed execs. Yet about halfway through DeVito loses his pace, and the film begins to feel more like a chaotic jumble, continually stuffing in new characters and plot twists, and with at least three seeming climaxes uneasily leading into further narrative development. Similarly, the film's treatment of Robin Williams' vengeance obsessed TV host Rainbow Randolph remains equally indecisive. Perhaps due to Williams' star casting, DeVito appears to struggle with exactly what to do with the character, whether to situate him as protagonist or depraved quasi-antagonist. As such, Randolph appears uncomfortably stuck between the two, and the film's ensuing rocky focalization makes it harder for the viewer to maintain their emotional bearings. The addition of a rather conventional romantic subplot also feels somewhat out of place in so uniformly dark and vindictive a picture, making the third act feel all the more unnecessarily chaotic. Nonetheless, despite this mishmash of content, somehow DeVito's loopy pace and zany, twisted sense of humour never quite loses the audience even at its most imbalanced, but instead only becomes more bizarre (often appealingly so) without sacrificing the entertainment front. DeVito also delights in inverting the typical characters his stars would play, resulting in a deliciously unconventional tweaking of expectations. Despite the publicity hyping Williams, Edward Norton is the most firmly situated as the film's 'main character', which works, as Norton is unreasonably hilarious, superbly counteracting his usual intensity as charming yet irritatingly well intentioned children's entertainer Smoochy the Rhino, who goes out of his way to refuse merchandising money in favour of promoting organic, sugar free foods and respecting hostile step-parents on children's television. Norton is careful to keep the character crucially likable, even at his most simperingly moronic, crafting an enduring emotional centre and grounding the calamity of the film around him. Similarly, fans of Robin Williams' less family sanctioned stand-up act will be enthralled by his performance as unhinged Rainbow Randolph. Retaining his usual flair for colourful improvisation, Williams lets loose in a twisted, exceedingly dark fashion barely glimpsed before, and while he unquestionably rockets light years past being over the top, his slew of bitter, incensed, profanity-fraught rants are just about worth watching the film by themselves.Catherine Keener's credible charisma and warmth also help acclimatize a shaky character transition from nihilistically jaded producer to earnest, hopeful young woman, making the potentially weakest point of the film instead burst to life with a quirky spark. Danny DeVito himself delivers a familiar but still enjoyable lampoon of the greedy agent figure, and an early performance by TV comic Jon Stewart delivers a tantalizing taste of a gestating talent. The film also offers a collection of memorable character bits worthy of the Coen brothers, from Michael Rispoli's blustering, often incomprehensible lovable nitwit of a former boxer, Danny Woodburn's sardonic children's television actor, and an utterly hilarious Vincent Schiavelli as a narcoleptic, heroin addict assassin.While certainly not for all tastes, Death to Smoochy delivers a unique, daringly morbid and raucously hilarious product which manages to continually dodge expectations while remaining enjoyable. While its unfavourable reaction is perhaps typical of so unconventional a picture, such a rare delight deserves to be enjoyed and appreciated, flaws and all, and those willing to take in a different kind of comedy are unlikely to be disappointed.-8/10 "},{"Title":"Comedy?","Date":"3 October 2003","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I picked this up from the video store not expecting much from it, but keeping an open mind because quite often underrated movies really surprise me.

Then shut the F up and let me do the thinking. The movie is filled with the cut-throat world of children's television, as you know it really is, behind the placid, happy land surface. The movie is funny from the first frame, where Rainbow gets busted by the Feds for taking bribes for prime seating for the little darlings, through to my personal favorite, when Rainbow books his replacement at a Nazi rally. As Smoochie comes onto the darkened stage, he is leaving Rainbow with some lobotomized mantra, Rainbow muttersWhatever the hell that means you F'ing hippie,'he pushes him out onto the dais. Smoochie asks for the house lights to be brought up and it is three hundred brown and black suited Nazis. As the speakers blare, Deutschland, Deutschland Uber Alles, the press and police run in and bust him. Suffice to say, he loses his job the next day. The movie is filled with hilarious characters, remember, I am not a big DeVito fan, I loved War Of The Roses but detested Hoffa. This was his best effort, it is funny all the way through. There is an Irish gang led by Tommy, the fiery red headed woman, you don't want to say no to.She has a punch drunk relative you better book on your kid's show, when Mopes tries to refuse the gang surrounds him. Tommy says,Boys, I am feeling really upset right now, One answers,Who is it that is upsetting up Tommy? She says,I don't want to mention any names, Sheldon quickly agrees before losing many teeth. The most hilarious is the charity Parade of Hope, that is skimming the ice show, you better come through, trust me. When Sheldon tries to refuse, he is ejected from their limo with Fierstein intoning,As for the ice show, I suggest you start shopping for skates. The movie follows Rainbow's determination to regain his lost kiddie show, whatever it takes. Norton plays Mopes as a likable but painfully quixotic, hippie throwback. He doesn't mix well with the tough as nails producer who turns out to be a kiddie show groupie, sleeping with everybody in an outfit. She has some of the best lines in the show, the movie is replete with funny characters, witty sarcastic dialog; when placed in the context of children's programming, it increases the hilarity. Rainbow breaks onto the set, steals the cookies and replaces all of them with phallic shaped cookies. I am not a big William's fan but he is at his funniest here. The movie gets serious near the end with the killing of Spinner and the attempted killing of Sheldon. I won't spoil who rescues Sheldon but, after this, comes my favorite line. The header is second, it is spoken by Rainbow when Jon Stewart gives him a sample bag from a Rain Forest fund-raiser. I still love when Tommy gets Devito and Stewart together, before killing them,So, have you two traveled together before? DeVito evinces a look of realization of what's coming next. Played tongue in cheek, the majority of the violence is off camera. Keener gives her best performance in any movie; actors I never was wild about (Stewart, Fierstein, Williams) are great because the writing is so good. It definitely is not for children, no way. The language is rough with plenty of bloodless violence. The jokes often wander into the sexual activities of Keener and different kiddie stars that would traumatize little pee wees. For me, it is one of the funniest movies all the way through, the scenes I shared are my favorites, there are many equally great ones.

So, I can only assume that mainstream moviegoers didn't think that much of it.If you're a fan of Robin Williams' quirky, light-hearted performances, then you may be disappointed. His role here is one of his darker, more serious ones (think 'One Hour Photo, only more openly psychotic). He plays a disgraced children's TV show presenter who vows - lethal - revenge on his successor - the mild-mannered and good-natured 'Smoochy' (his stage name), played by Edward Norton. Also, it's fair to say that, despite Robin Williams being billed as the 'star,' I was surprised at how much screen time was given to Edward Norton - really he should be billed as the star.There are mob hits, beatings, murder, blackmail and Nazis in this film - hardly the stuff of your average family comedy. Therefore, the humour is pretty black. It's also a satire - showing you the 'dark side' of something so allegedly pure as children's TV.If you like your movies dark, satirical and slightly over the top, then give this one a go.

It's very off-beat; more of a funny noir film than a black comedy. The audience is meant to identify with Sheldon Mopes (Ed Norton) as an outsider who discovers that children's television programming is more of a criminal enterprise akin to a 1930's era Mafia than what Sesame Street would have you believe.There are levels of complexity in the characters that most people who consider the likes of Scary Movie to be classic comedy will likely miss. It's easy to hate Mopes at first He is, after all, representative of the epitome of all hated kid TV mascots, Barney the Purple Dinosaur. He is more than he appears, however. Sheldon Mopes has a violent anger within him that finally threatens to erupt by the end of the film. Despite that, he's a genuinely good guy who is pushed to the brink by an industry insane with corruption. Robin William's Rainbow Randolph is a man miserable with his own corruption who shifts the blame for his position to Mopes simply because Smoochy inadvertently benefits from his downfall. Randolph's insanity eventually leads to a sort of impish super-villainy until he is ready to accept the blame himself. Catherine Keener plays the evil bitch beautifully again, until Mopes helps her to remember why she got into the business of children's entertainment in the first place (she seems a little delusional too; when she mentions that Harvey Firestein's character Marv Green grabbed her ass at a benefit dinner I had to say, yeah, right. Sure, Firestein's character isn't explicitly gay in the film but c'mon, it's Harvey freakin' Firestein). Danny DeVito is his usual charming self as the astoundingly belligerent Burke Bennet, a conniving rat who conspires to have his own client bumped off.While the production is amazing, and it is certainly so, it pales when compared to the amount of acting and comedy talent in this film. Though I will admit that John Stewart is wasted here as a witless straight man, there are nuances to the comedy that are hard to pick up on a single viewing. My favorite example is when Rainbow Randolph dupes Mopes into playing a Nazi rally to discredit him Williams shifts between no less than three accents including Scottish, Australian, and Irish. The fact that the characters (and many of the viewers who watch the film) don't pick up on this is to me one of the little joys (of many) of the film (another is Rainbow's theme song which is filled with sexual innuendo). Oh yeah, and Vincent Schiavelli is awesome as the extremely creepy Buggy Ding Dong, but then again he's always awesome.My one gripe (and it is a minor one) is the ice show at the end credits. It just seems a little forced.This is one of the most complete films I've seen in the last ten years, and is one of those rare comedies that I can bring myself to watch it again and again (like MP and the HG, Clerks, and other nerd-fests).

I can't understand how a movie with such a great cast and a director who has proved he's the king of black comedies could be so disappointing. To me, at least.Here's where my problem is The parts with Rainbow Raindolph trying to sabotage Smoochy are hilarious. I admit that. But the whole plot about the mob, and the 'reality' behind children's TV shows is just retarded. What the hell kind of satirical statement is that? It's sort of funny to think, hey, what if the makers behind Sesame Street are really insane drug addicts with ties to the mob? and things like that, but Death To Smoochy takes that idea too far. It would be a lot funnier if it was just about Rainbow Randolph VS. Smoochy. I'd recommend just watching the trailer for this one. I'm not sure exactly how long the actual movie was, but however long it was it felt TOO long.

I will give you that it points out that Barney and such may have been started for a greater good but then get thrown into the gutter for profits, but I didn't need this movie to show me that, it is obvious.  This movie has a stellar cast, a decent director with a track record, but fails miserably at being FUNNY.  Yeah, I got a chuckle out of the step-dad song, but one chuckle does not make a movie.Let's start with the positives.  Edward Norton is Smoochy and surprisingly handles the role well.  He seemed to take the character he played throughout Primal Fear and turned him into a guy who wants to change the world for the better.Catherine Keener is the girl, who is all about the money until Smoochy walks into her life.  I like Keener, who was wasted in her role, but did a good job with the part she was given.There are your positives, now to the negatives (I don't think IMDB gives me enough space to truly handle them all, so I will condense them)Jon Stewart's role was pathetic and his acting was as bad.  The scene with Williams and him in the car was just disturbing, and he brought nothing to the table.Danny Devito tried like always, but I don't know if it was a problem with directing himself, but his performance seemed flat and his direction...Robin Williams tried TOO HARD TO BE FUNNY.  His character was horribly written and lacked the depth that was necessary to create the illusion of caring for his down-on-his-luck Rainbow (unlike One Hour Photo, where his performance was perfect).All the rest of the cast stunk up the joint, but I really don't think it was from lack of trying, I think the material just didn't merit this movie to be made.  I mean the script has Irish mobsters, clowns, midgets, a drugged out hitman who was an ex-children's show host, a character named Rainbow, a character named Smoochy, a charity organization doing mob-like tactics, a retarded former prizefighter who rings a bell, and Nazis.  It was not funny at all.  It was not insightful, unless you didn't know that people (including those behind children's shows) try and make money.  It smelled of a Shakes the Clown rip-off, and anyone who has seen that movie knows that a rip-off of that movie has to stink (especially Mr. Williams, who was in both).I don't blame Mr. Devito, I think he directed a movie made with a horrible script as well as could be expected.  His choice to take it very dark was the only way to salvage an absolute mess.  It didn't work, but at least he tried.The real problem for me is that Barney is ultra-annoying and should be an easy target to lampoon.  This movie instead became as annoying as Barney and on top of that offensive to downright obscene in parts and it couldn't make me laugh.  The entire ending ice-capades sequence was so over-the-top (not the credits one which was even MORE over-the-top, but the actual ice show) it just made you want to scream in disgust that someone greenlighted this piece of trash.  Tack on the credits sequence which screamed FILLER, and this movie just overstays it's welcome.  Actually I think I should have just shut it off after the first half-hour because it wasn't going to get any better.If you actually liked this drivel, Hollywood has a track-record of making these types of movies ten times more often than a really good movie, so you are in luck.  I can't believe I agree with Roger Ebert, this movie was horrible and I am in shock that this movie is averaging a 6.6 on IMDB. That shows you how bad movies have become, but I gave this movie what it deserved a 1 out of 10.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, life is too short.

Second viewing however, I realized it was a comedic gem, with subtle humor all the way through, and some outright hilarious scenes that are one of a kind, perfectly executed, and great acting. Robin Williams is a kids TV host and character that loses his job, for taking bribes off parents that want their kids on the show. So he gets canned, loses everything, goes nuts, everyone rejects him. Ed Norton, a rehab motivational guitar playing nice guy, gets his job as the Smoochy character, and Robin Williams wants revenge. Robin Williams plays the role of the mildly insane bad guy perfectly, just hilarious and unpredictable. The 'cookie' scene has got to be one of the greatest scenes ever. The restaurant mascot,owned by the Irish mob, is named Spinner, and is a very funny ex- boxer thats punch drunk,and every scene he is in just makes me laugh every time. All in all, great writing, great acting, and a very clever and hilarious take on the corruption in big business, but the first time I've seen it based around children's TV!

This is a film that requires multiple viewings. There is a lot of symbolism in this film that most people miss.

He appears to have a halo around him, as he sits at the long narrow table. Now observe Mr. Stewart's character- similar framing, but his 'halo' is red and sinister. The messianic undertones are far from subtle in this movie,but the film's true intent is left purposely vague. Are they ironically comparing children's TV hosts to a modern day Jesus? Or is there another layer of metaphor? Either way, this film is infinitely entertaining. I disagree with the assertion that it's a black comedy-it's dark, and oddly funny, but mainly, it's art. It defies genre and popularity polls. This is one of those movies that rewards attentive viewers.This is also a great performance by Robin Williams. If you don't like this movie, perhaps you would prefer to watch a different Robin Williams movie-such as Old Dogs. Cretin.

It's an all star pisser that fires on its alcoholic, manic depressive cylinders for its entire running time, and doesn't let up with the demented antics for a minute. Robin Williams plays dirtbag kids TV show host Rainbow Randolph like a bat out of hell on crack. He's a force of fast talking nature in the role, dominating every scene with a gleeful scuzzy, lovable nastiness that's just wonderful. When he's fired for being a scumbag, the ratings obsessed manager (Jon Stewart of all people) replaces him with upstart fool Smoochy The Rhino, aka Edward Norton. Norton throws himself knowingly into the wicked comedy and gives us a naive, vegan, borderline retarded sap, and owns every minute. Catherine Keener plays the slutty network recruiter with her typical scary sass and underlying warmth, with a slutty side (she likes to make it with the hosts when they're in costume). Randolph then does everything in his power to sabotage Smoochy, going to some shocking, perverted lengths. This is a full on, risky, extremely R rated comedy and that could be why it was so hated on. Don't listen to a word of naysaying. It's an absolute riot. Devito, who has a god given gift for these mean spirited comedies, shows up as a sleazeball agent. There's awesome work from Vincent Schiavelli, Robert Prosky, Pam Ferris and Harvey Fierstein as well.

Dismissed from his beloved job when he's caught taking payola, Randolph becomes increasingly mentally unhinged and the target of his delusional revenge fantasies is Sheldon Mopes, otherwise known as Smoochy, the fuchsia rhino character that has replaced him and soared to national popularity.

Well, maybe it isn't, but Danny DeVito sure thinks it is in his darkly comic film Death to Smoochy. It is about an idealistic purple rhino named Smoochy, created by Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton) who replaces another star, Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) after Randolph gets busted for a bribery scandal. Sheldon strives to make big changes in the world of children's television and he wants to keep all of his business squeaky clean. But everyone else tries to thwart his idealism, opening up a world of dog-eat-dog scandals. The film tries to be outrageous as possible and unfortunately misses the mark.Death to Smoochy has a great premise. Taking such a loving and colorful medium like kids television and then adding such a dark twist is a hilarious idea. This thought satisfies all of our adolescent fantasies of disproving the lovey-dovey side of Barney. It harps on the thought that maybe there was a darker side behind the scenes of Sesame Street. It is hilarious adult satire. But, as always, the best ideas receive the poorest executions. Death to Smoochy falls flat in its spoofing of the world of kids television with a mafia like twist. The film starts out great and it cruelly tricks you into believing you are about to watch an ingeniously clever satire. But the film then starts to move to a more narrow and cliché road until it completely falls apart in the end. Death to Smoochy attempts to create complex conspiracies and scandals all through the Barney-like medium. But the film loses control of itself and goes too far. When the dust finally settles, a plethora of plot holes open up and we see just how poorly this story is constructed. It gets too ridiculous to enjoy by the end, losing the clever satire and falling to mindless comedy.But Death to Smoochy isn't all bad. Danny DeVito directs in a very cartoony way that is amusingly entertaining throughout. The film also boasts all kinds of vibrant colors and exuberant set pieces that ironically contrast the darkly humorous tone of the film. The characters do the same thing. The first character we are introduced to is Rainbow Randolph and his multi-colored sparkling vest as he dances, surrounded by lollipops and rainbows. Then we meet the real Rainbow Randolph who is a foul mouthed, deranged drunkard that Robin Williams portrays excellently. The film delivers an all star cast that do a great job, but in the end are wasted potential. We are delivered the comedic stylings of everyone from Williams, to DeVito himself, and even Jon Stewart who I won't call a great actor but as a huge fan of The Daily Show I couldn't help but enjoy seeing him in this movie. However, these high points of Death to Smoochy don't save it from being a very weak film.Had there been a little more thought put into Death to Smoochy's plot it could have been an incredible comedy. It has an incredibly original premise that bears a world of potential, but this film leaves all that potential on the side and instead goes for a very lackluster plot. It's a shame to see such great actors give it their all in this film, only to have their effort tattered by the weak storyline and the plot holes so big you drive an eighteen wheeler through them.

Williams plays Rainbow Randolph, a kid's show host who is fired for taking bribes. The studio demands he be replaced with someone squeaky clean. Enter Sheldon Mopes (Norton) as Smoochy the Rhino, a character so sugary sweet that diabetics should be careful watching him.Smoochy immediately becomes a hit, much to the ire of the now defamed Rainbow Randolph. Bitter and angry, he makes it his mission to screw over Smoochy and get himself back on TV. Williams is perfect for this role, and handles it with a quirky glee that makes him a joy to watch. He looks like he's having fun the entire movie, whether being beaten senseless by the Irish mob or dancing in the streets when Smoochy is taken off the air.Toss in Harvey Fierstein as the head of a crooked charity, DeVito as the scheming manager, and Jon Stewart as all around toad Marion Stokes and this movie is complete.

However, this movie is one of DeVito's better works, not necessarily due to his directing but because of actors who play the three main characters (Ed Norton, Robin Williams, Catherine Keener).The movie revolves around a children's show on a network named KidNet. `Rainbow Randolph' (Robin Williams) plays the main character on the TV show and is the adulated star.until he gets caught accepting bribes from parents who want to ensure better placement of their child/actors on the stage.Randolph is quickly fired and Frank Stokes (Jon Stewart), the producer of the show, is directed by the corporate heads to find a replacement whose ethics is beyond reproach.  He decides on a relatively unknown bit character called Smoochy, who is played by Sheldon Mopes (Ed Norton) and orders his assistant Nora (Catherine Keener) to sign him.  Nora, barely hiding her jadedness, gets Sheldon to agree to star in KidNets children's show, with him playing Smoochy, a creature of Sheldon's creation that looks like miscegenation between a rhino and Barney.  Sheldon, being a naïve, politically correct altruist, doesn't seem to realize what he's getting into - he expects the show to be a platform for him to promote worthwhile values to his viewers, the children.  Norton plays the naiveté part well, much like his performance as the stuttering murderer with multiple personalities in `Primal Fear'.  He portrays a look of innocence with his eyes and body language, as someone who is gullible and innocent, yet good of heart. Sheldon does not expect to encounter the crass commercialization of children's TV nor of the various unseemly characters who want to profit from the TV show thru kickbacks and graft.  He is shocked at what really goes on behind the scenes at a children's show.Meanwhile, Randolph, who is now destitute after being fired by KidNet, goes off the deep end. Upon learning of Smoochy replacing `Rainbow Randolph', Randolph's jealousy of this usurper transforms him into a raving maniac fixated on destroying Smoochy's career and getting his old job back on the children's show.   With his strong and sometimes contorted facial expressions, his verbal rapidity, and his demented wit, Williams does a very good job portraying the unbalanced, obsessive psychotic bent on getting back at Smoochy.Catherine Keener also adds to this movie as Nora, the cynical and jaded assistant producer.  This role is perfect for Keener's trademark, a personality of sarcasm and surliness that gives her character an edge. She fights Sheldon's attempts to de-commercialize the children's show, at one point locking him out of a meeting room so he cannot complain about the show pushing new `Smoochy' products to the kids.  Sheldon describes her jadedness by accusing her of viewing children as `dollar signs with pony tails'.Nora clashes with Sheldon about the direction of the show throughout most of the movie.  Sheldon wants to redefine the purpose of the show to be one that educates children and espouses values like sharing while Nora and the rest of the staff are cynical enough to realize that the show's main purpose (and main source of revenue) is to promote Smoochy-related products that KidNet sells.  This becomes an indictment of today's children shows on TV.  Nora doesn't believe in Sheldon's good heart  - she's too cynical to believe that Sheldon is really that naïve and altruistic; she's seen too many character stars who had professed to care about the welfare of children only to sell out when the price was high enough.Other stars, like Danny DeVito, play peripheral parts; DeVito plays a slimy agent named Burke Bennett, who is in cahoots with others interested in using the TV show for profit by unethical means.  He plays that part well - when was the last time DeVito didn't play a shady and distrustful character? Another question why wasn't he in `Lord of the Rings' playing the role of one of the trolls?Harvey Fierstein also plays a minor part as the head of a syndicate that uses a charity as a dummy front to make money.  He is in cahoots with Bennett and Burke in a plan to make some money by associating his charity with Smoochy's show.  It's obvious Fierstein took this part in this movie to break out of his typecast, which is that of an effeminate, gay male with a husky voice.  He does a good job acting as the head gangster in the beginning, using his deep voice to convey a sense of threat.  But as the movie goes on, his character talks more and more and his effort to hide his effeminate mannerisms become less effective - by the end of the movie, the change in the pitch of his speech give him away as a gay male and that detracts from his effort to portray a cold, ruthless leader of organized crime.There is also a female head of an Irish gang named Tommy (Pam Ferris) who intimidates Sheldon into giving a role for her cousin Spinner Dunn (Michael Rispoli), a once-famous boxer who took too many blows to the head and is suffering the consequences.  She plays a part in the outcome of the story.You can see the direction this movie will take and the 2nd half of it is anticlimactic.   The bad guys' plot fails, the good guys win, Randolph's rivalry with Sheldon is resolved, Nora's cold heart is reignited by Sheldon's real and virtuous behavior, and Sheldon is able to keep his principles in the midst of crass commercialization so prevalent in today's children's shows.  A sappy ending, quite predictable, but still a funny movie nonetheless, especially due to Robin Williams' performance.

Death To Smoochy was one of those chance meetings with a film, in which it draws you in and kicks you in the bum by being so unpredictable. Seeing that Robin Williams and Ed Norton are the main stars i hoped Smoochy would be a good film, and i was not at all disappointed. The film opens with a montage of what is to be expected, colour, vibrancy, comedy but with a dark, violent edge in the world of childrens television. We are then shown Rainbow Randolph (williams) and co. in their tv show. Turns out randolph is a shady character looking for some extra cash or 'ass-wipe money'. He's caught out and that's where Smoochy (norton) steps in. But Rainbow Randolph aint a happy chappy bout that one!Despite what people have said, Death To Smootchy is one crack up of a film. I've sat through films like Dumb and Dumber, get shorty, meet the parents etc. the apparent Comedies of the year and hilariously funny films and have barely cracked a smile, not to say i have no sense of humour, it's just too much hype, and terrible scripts, but Smoochy had me in hysterics, from start to finish, brilliant movie, danny de-vito should be extremely proud of this effort, it might not be the critical/financial hit it deserves to be, but Smoochy is probably the best american film i have ever seen!Remember friends come in all sizes!

In fact, I'd venture to say that the style of this film is almost comic book in nature. The lighting is very stark and solid in it's choice of colors and the characters are almost ripped from the pages of a Dick Tracy comic book, albeit a more modern one.Robin Williams gives a very funny performance as a homo-repressed over-the-top children's TV host and delivers his comedy in his characteristic rapid fire delivery. It's classic Robin Williams. Edward Norton shows us yet another side to his character acting skills as a meek and mild, cleaner than clean wannabe children's television host. His opening scene performing at a heroin clinic is just classic, Let's face it. Big junkies come from little junkies. We gotta nip this in the bud, Burke!. Yet Norton plays Smoochy with a bit of a hidden dark edge that keeps you thinking he's going to pop at any moment. It just keeps the energy of the film always at a high rev.Overall, Death To Smoochy is Mr. Rogers, meets The Simpsons, meets Ren and Stimpy. It's a farcical romp through a very distorted view of children's television that will have you laughing in that fun, but un-comfortable way.

Of course, all satire is based to some extent on truth, but this story isn't looking to besmirch Mr. Rogers or Sesame Street.  It is modeled more on commercialized shows going back to the 1950s such as Pinky Lee, much later with Pee Wee Herman, and most recently with Barney, all of which capitalized unmercifully on their characters.  Beyond that, the message of the film is about what happens when a genuinely sincere individual finds himself sucked into a world thoroughly corrupt, and motivated by unbridled selfishness and petty jealousies.  Although its theme is related to children's shows, it is not a film for children.  It is very dark and disturbing, with lots of strong language, violence and sexual content. Its subject for satire is the business of children's television, which behind the scenes can be very ugly, hypocritical, and exploiting.It does not try to have a message, but one still results What ever happened to children's television such that anything resembling value to children got left out?  There used to be shows in which kids were involved, and not just as voices in cartoons.  Real human children are more meaningful to other children than cartoons, but it is cheaper to make cartoons than to pay for live humans.  Cartoons sell toys and junk-food more dependably than children do, anyway, and they don't complain about issues of sincerity. It's just a business, after all, the purpose of which is to make money. It's not about children, but exploiting them for profits, and that is the message that emerges from Smoochy.  If even children's television is unscrupulous, what does that say for the rest of the entertainment business?

Though lacking slightly in plot development, DeVito's film offers more than enough elements to entertain the viewer. The first are his stage settings. These are very colorful and highly produced, offering the viewer that well needed escape from what has become over-played ultra-realism.Williams' choreographic performance caught my attention immediately. He danced through his scenes expertly and showcased his character with aplomb. His character allowed him to show off his acting range handsomely.Overall, the acting was skilled and credible. A couple of issues in character/plot development made it unclear if the writing or the editing was lacking. The first example is the abrupt change in demeanor on the part of the lead female character. The acting was excellent, but the transition from angry young female to admiring love interest happened without sufficient warning. The character essentially went from black to white without having established a potential for such a significant change.Another issue, which I assume was related to the editing, was a loose end delivered by Smoochy. The character claimed that he had been forced to take an anger management class sometime in his past, but the unfolding of the plot seemed to make that remark irrelevant.In spite of these issues, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to overly cerebral or passionate flicks.

Ed Norton shines with his gee whiz! demeanor as he dances around in a rhino outfit. As Randolph yells to God in the middle of Times Square, after he has again been shoved aside for Smoochy, What does it all MEAN? What does it all mean, indeed? Just how crass it is to make money off kids, and the tripe we produce as entertainment (including some rather comical ice capades.) How the most innocent-seeming of industries is rife with jealousy, politics and greed. That it can all be the basis for a black comedy.

In general, the action is quick in the beginning as it is with the current film archetypes. Boom, Devito throws us into his world immediately.His world, of course, is that of the absurd.  Anyone who talks bad about this film's cruel language, plot realism, purpose, kill Barney jabs, etc... obviously missed the big point Devito made.It's all absurd.  A competitive market for children's tv show characters? Stat sheets for these up and coming 'performers'?  One man, obsessed enough to gather Nazi's to a tractor warehouse?  It's all absurd. (Absurd as in, theater of the absurd; although, outrageous fits here also)  The whole thing.  The environment, the plot, the meaning (which does hold basis in our temporal world of reasoning) Everything is overly dramatic and done over the top.  The Sets, the actions, the single-sided characters...  It's Devito's own ideas of the state of the American Public.The film is dark... the seedy underbelly of children's programming, gun-toting charity groups skimming a little 'off the top' (strangely reminsicant of Serpico).

Much like most of DeVito's films it has great style and a nice pace in energy. The characters alone are great, very funny. The plot builds on itself pretty well. Sometimes things seem too contrived, but for the most part they work. The acting is great (minus the GREAT Jon Stewart. Sorry Jon. You are now the host of may be the greatest show of our time, but that is who you are. It's just weird seeing you out there on the field). Where does this movie go wrong? Easy, the characters are fine by themselves, but when asked to be in a seen together, to communicate with one another, these characters break down. They don't mix well, it's weird to see Nora and Sheldon start having (let me put in away Smoochy might), Humpty-dumpty rumpty time... together.And the anger of Randolph, (while really funny) lets us down by the end. And a strange team-up happens that when you see you think, Of course this is what happens. Not, Oh! Of course this is what happens! Why didn't I see it before, how clever! The movie was dark but it felt like it wanted to be darker, meaner, but it was too nice.On the other hand Death to Smoochy is not the train wreck so many are calling it. In fact it's completely watchable. (Smoochy's song about stepfathers may be one of the funniest songs ever written). If I was to teach a film school I would use the style of this film. The colors,  the movement of the cameras, it's all great.

Instead, everyone involved in `Death to Smoochy' should wash their mouths out with soap, go to their rooms for a while and sincerely think about what they have done.You see, it's not often such a great cast gets put together (or that Jon Stewart gets more than three minutes of slated screen time) or that America has healed enough from its wounds to finally be able to enjoy a good `Kill Barney' movie again.But you weren't thinking about that Mr. DeVito, now were you?  No, you got too caught up in the subplot with the mafia and with repetitive character mannerisms.  You forgot to let the actors be themselves.  You got lazy and you let us down.  Now I want you to write a thousand times `I will not waste talent.  I will not waste talent.  I will not waste talent.'  And so on.Remember when you had the Irish lady say she would cut off the guy's b***s and shove them up his a**, and then Ed Norton's character said, `no, we should save that for the cops to do,' and then the other Irish guy said, `actually, the cops won't do the b*** shoving thing-it's against procedure.' That was crude, and I don't approve of that sort of language, but it was also very funny and there were a lot of laugh-out loud moments like that.You see, you can be good when you want to be.  You can be very good and we want to love you so much but sometimes you just put so much emphasis on moving the plot forward that you forget to be funny and it frustrates your mother and I.  It's just that you have so much potential and we've already given up on your older siblings and you were our last chance to do things right.  You were supposed to be the good one.We wish you would have devoted a little more time to Smoochy's kids show. The singalong about stepfathers was inspired, but most of the other songs didn't seem to have required much thought, and there were so many jabs at the Barney phenomenon just begging to be made that you didn't even explore. We raised you better than that.I know I've already mentioned this, but you could have really done without a lot of the scatological humor.  Half the time you have Robin Williams screaming I can't even tell what he's saying, but I can pretty much guess that it starts with an 'f' and it ain't 'funny.'  Just because something's in your pants doesn't make it a punchline.Incidentally, have you thought about what we talked about last week? Have you declared a major yet?  How are things working out between you and Rhea? When are you going to make us grandparents?  When are you going to make something of your life?  We worry about you, you know.  We love you.I don't want to get all gushy here, but in your finest moments, of which there were many, you have done us proud, son.  Ed Norton's Smoochy is so blissfully naïve until he falls out of character at the end.  Robin Williams' Rainbow Randolph is so savagely funny even when he falls out of character at the end.  And the end credits, an hilarious sendup of Peter Pan on Ice, are so campily great until they end up ending . . . at the end.It's moments like these that make me think that things could have turned out differently.  Maybe if only we had been better to you.  Maybe if we had gone to see you play T-ball when you were a kid, or if I would have taken you out for ice cream after you got your tonsils out.  Maybe if we would have been there for you through the thick and thin of it all, instead of just showing up in your life for the first time at a press screening four days before your theatrical release. But now you're all grown up and it's too late for both of us to change. You've already been through post-production and distribution and played in theatres across the nation.

Unfortunately, I've seen all three films he wrote this one, Lucky Numbers and (get ready) Cabin Boy. I didn't like any of them, but there's a certain consistency to them. While watching all three of them, I said to myself, Hmmm. That should make me laugh. But it doesn't. Something about this guy's work just does not translate. And yet, I'm not sure the writing was the main culprit here. Instead, I blame three other elements. First, Ed Norton. Yeah yeah, great actor and all. Love him in almost everything else. But how they settled on him for the role of Sheldon/Smoochy is beyond me. He brought entirely the wrong vibe, spirit and mannerisms to the part. In no way does this role suit him.Second, Catherine Keener. Anyone else getting tired of seeing this girl play a bitch? Best I can tell, she's a one-note actress, and I've heard enough of that note. Thanks, Catherine. Next time we need a hardened  urban professional woman who uses sarcasm as a defense mechanism, we'll be sure to give you a call. Until then, I suggest trying to find the other two dimensions to your characters.Third, and most crucial, the direction. Devito just f*cked this one up. Where he should have gone for irony, he went for maliciousness. It tilts the boat the wrong way, and everyone goes into the drink. I almost always like Danny, but he did not interpret this script right. Because of that, this movie never really had a chance.If you give me this script, these actors and this director, I agree to make this film any day of the week. Oh well.

Now we fast forward to today where he has delved deep down into the darkest recesses of his mind to churn out a film that is so ridiculous it is entertaining. The film starts off with the arrest of children's television king Rainbow Randolph for taking a bribe from agents posed as parents wanting their child on his show. With an open time slot just waiting to be filled TV big wigs turn to an out of luck, good-natured, purple rhino named Smoochy. Smoochy's main goal in life is to bring his good morals to the children of the world but he is constantly at battle to due so because his bosses are only interested in squeezing every penny out of the world with Smoochy as their outlet. But as Smoochy sky-rockets to the top of kiddie land Randolph slowly loses his mind and does everything he can to ruin the rhino at any cost to position himself back on top, even if this means replacing Smoochy's cookies with one the is shaped like a penis. This film supposedly focuses on the backstage life of television show hosts, one faulting because he is rotten to the core and one faulting because he doesn't have an indecent bone in his body and how the money hungry executives will stop at no cost to sell their product, sound like  satire? Well yes and no. It does attempt to be smart and convey a certain message but the simple fact is that it never once seems to take itself seriously, we have a slimy manager, a producer with a fetish for TV show hosts, a stadium fill of Nazi's, a doped up hit man, and an Irish mob boss, now someone please tell me how you can make a serious film out of that. I expected nothing from this film when I saw it and maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much, but the film does struggle to find a common medium for its audience. Teen's won't find it funny because the comedy is far to dark and mature for their liking but it is far to goofy for the hardcore film buffs to take a liking to, rendering it a love or hate find of film. Robbin Williams is constantly hilarious as Randolf who to me shows a lot of the spirit here that he does while watching him do live stand-up. Ed Norton is good as Smoochy, I suppose but the character is so boring and annoying that he hardly seems fit to be here. Danny DeVito and John Stewart have small but important roles as weasels only out to make a quick buck, but the true comedic gold comes from Michael Rispoli as Spinner Dunn, a former boxer who seems to have taken a few to many blows to the head because he has the IQ of about a five year old. Rispoli steals every scene and makes every word out of his mouth nothing short of hilarious, I couldn't help but laugh out loud when he yells Hey Smoochy I'll be right back I've got to take a dump in across a public restaurant. This film has received many bad reviews, Ebert and Roeper even went as far as to call it the worst film of the year, but even through all of those harsh comments I just couldn't help but sit back and have a good time. This film is offensive, vulgar and seriously twisted but it sure is fun if you take it from the proper context. If you are looking for some deep message and some smart comedy your not going to get it and probably hate what you see, as this film is not for everyone. If you are just looking for an over-the-top look on a topic so stupid it almost has to be funny then your in for a treat. The material within may not be a crowning comedic achievement but it sure made my night, check it out and see for yourself.

Garnished by a few inspired Improvs by Williams which probably made for some good trailer sound bites, I found this movie failed because it had no credible audience. With a script that insults the intelligence of an 8 year old and the verbal sexual content which is inappropriate for most children, which audience was this movie targetting? My answer is a marginal group of adults who watch TV in snippets who don't really care for an original story i.e. box office bomb material!While some of the visuals including the ice show scenes were grand, in the end, there was no story here worth telling to mass appeal and the non connect left me asking Was there more than Rudolph's jacket to this movie?

I have usually found that most dark comedies  forget the comedy part.  But, I thought that Smoochy delivered on the goods.  There aren't any real belly laughs in the movie, but there are several chuckles.  Most of the humor revolves around Sheldon (Smoochy/Norton) being kind of a fish out of water as a children's TV entertainment personality.  Not that he is unsuited to entertain children, but just the opposite.  He is perfectly suited to entertain children, while practically everyone else in the industry has long ago forgotten about the children in exchange for promoting their own interests, and lining their own pockets.  So, everyone struggles to manipulate Smoochy for their own interests, while Smoochy wants nothing that isn't in the best interest of his child fans.  Of course, meanwhile, a nearly, over the top Robin Williams plots for Smoochy's overthrow, as revenge for Smoochy taking his time slot on TV.I enjoyed the conflicts, and found the movie to be enjoyable.

Certainly worth watching on video, if for no other reason than to catch Edward Norton's great-ish performance as Smoochy, the New Millenium Barney and Candide all wrapped up in one. Unfortunately, Robin Williams as his main nemesis plays the same hyperkinetic character he has played in endless films, although he has a couple of funny moments. He isn't the star, thank God, and does not appear in large segments of the movie. The plot is paper-thin and the movie goes on far too long. It is just not particularly funny and a lot of the attempts at humor feel strained. That's director Danny DeVito's fault and no one else's. But it is mildly entertaining and if you can stay with it, there is a clever, and very odd, fantasy-on-ice schtick at the end. Once you have seen this black comedy-cum-sappy up-with-people plot, imagine a director like Terry Gilliam at the helm instead of Danny DeVito. Now for one huge plot hole Norton is convinced by various and sundry folks to authorize a Smoochy ice show, which he ultimately decides to star in himself. This allows for an exciting if contrived climax, when a hired gun tries to take Norton out while the show is going on. But why does Norton star in the show in the first place? There isn't a single hint given during the entire movie that Norton's character would know how to skate well enough to star in an ice show. And even if he were a champion skater, which again I must point out is not established, where would he find the time and why would he bother when he has a TV show to put on? The character he plays is in a costume that would make it impossible to tell who is in the suit. Wouldn't it have logically been played by a professional ice skater? On the other hand, if you think of the movie as pure fantasy, it makes a little more sense. But the movie is not a fantasy. Anyhow, it's worth watching on a slow Saturday night, for the performances if nothing else. DeVito as Smoochy's unscrupulous agent hams it up throughout, as does Harvey Feierstein as a mob boss, but some of the other characters are pretty well played. Such as Pam Farris as the head of a tough Irish family and Katherine Keener as a network VP.

I highly commend those of you who picked up on (or inserted, depending on your perspective) subversive, humorous, interesting, etc. meanings from the film.  I also understand the perspective of those of you who felt the film failed, was stupid or pointless.  Neither side is entirely correct, however.I felt that Keener, Williams and (especially) Norton did a fabulous job with a script that more than occasionally did not live up to its potential.  The film did not maintain the boisterous energy it began and ended with; several sections in the middle lagged more than a little.  But the costumes and sets compensated somewhat.

We needed to see the crazy-funny side to him that we saw in Good Morning Vietnam or The Fisher King.

His show is cancelled, and the network that carried his show tried to look for a TV show with a guy who was 100% clean cut without even the most minor offense to his or her name.  So enters Smoochy, a purple rhinocerous played by Edward Norton, who is 100% clean and lives up to his image.  He goes from Playing guitar in a drug rehab clinic to hosting a hugely successful kids show.Randolph, pathetic as he is, tries to bring Smoochy down.  However, in a complex twist of plot, Randolph's not the only one, and so tells this very dark comedy.Williams is excellent as Rainbow Randolph.

I am a fan of the dark comedy and this one kept me rolling as much as the seats in our new theater would allow.Shortly afterwards, I got to talking with a friend of mine about the movie, and an interesting line of conversation arose.  In America, we seem to have this peculiar notion that everything has a dark underbelly.  In the case of Smoochy, this happens to be children's television.  Think about it. There is not a single organization (or individual, for that matter) that is not suspected of being somehow secretly underhanded.  We expect that even the best of people will one day end up as the cover story of 20/20 or Dateline.I cannot say when this sort of thinking began in our country.  Most likely, its foundations were laid in the 60s and grew ever more hungry as the decades passed, perhaps culminating in the televangelist scandals of the 80s.  Regardless, here it is and its likely here to stay.DeVito's film paints a fascinating picture of the kids' TV underworld, which is desperate to find a character with real integrity as the movie opens. And yet, this better-than-perfect television savior is systematically mocked and taken advantage of throughout the picture.  As a viewer, I too was searching for the tragic flaw that would bring him to his knees like the rest of the slime with whom he mingled.All in all, one can learn a valuable lesson from DeVito's laughably twisted film.  Sure, every person and every organization has its flaws and failures. Which is why when someone doesn't appear to be flawed, he becomes comical. The important thing is that despite these drawbacks in character, we can work toward the good of things that are important and valuable, e.g., Catherine Keener's character and Robin Williams's character by the end.

This, most people will forget, most people didn't even like it or care to see.  I was lucky enough to see this film...and i loved it.  The film, directed by Danny DeVito and written by Adam Resnick, follows Rainbow Randolph Smiley(Robin Williams) a beloved kid TV show host that gets caught taking a payment by parents of a child to make sure their child would dance on his show.  He is fired from the show by the producers, M. Frank Stokes( Jon Stewart) and Nora Wells(Catherine Keener)and adventally replace him with 'Smoochy'(Edward Norton).  Sheldon Mopes(Edward Norton), the name of the man that plays Smoochy, is an all aound good, clean guy.  He doesn't like violence, doesn't curse, and doesn't even want to take money from the public for apperances; he is the good person that Smoochy is, he's the real deal. Rainbow Randolph is jealous, he's filled with complete hatred for Smoochy, he wants to kill Smoochy for taking his time slot.  He stalks Smoochy, he tries to make Smoochy look like a fool, he all around just wants his old life back, after getting fired he looses everything, including his sanity.  The film just follows all the tries of Rainbow to get his life back and even throws in a little love story between Nora and Sheldon.  I feel most people won't like this movie because it's to dark for them to see the comedy in it, there are a few dark moments whee u think ' Can DeVito get away with this?'  I thought the comedy was done great, I laughed more in this movie then i have in other comedies that were taglined as comedies.  I think the best performance in this movie is Robin Williams as Rainbow Randolph, he goes off the deep end, he puts everything he has in it and just goes wild, just like the character is, wild.  Norton is just fine as the do-gooder Mopes, but even though he is funny, Williams just makes you forget everybody else is in the movie, you can't wait to see what he puts Smoochy through next.

Both movies take their subject matter to such an extreme that they almost end up being a parody of themselves, and neither seems to care of what the consequences will be. The question is, does it work? Mars Attacks! didn't work because the sci-fi spoof had been done better... but Death to Smoochy works because it's fresh, demanding, and above all else, hilariously funny.Robin Williams makes the best of an underwritten role, making sure that you have just the right amount of sympathy for his character. (This ends up going two ways, but I won't say how.) Edward Norton usually doesn't play this type of role - normally, you'd see him in roles like the one Williams has here) but he mixes the over-idealism of Sheldon with real-world sensibility perfectly. Catherine Keener's change from a overzealous, filthy-mouthed producer seems a bit artificial, but the realism of Sheldon's change more than makes up for it.The movie can be overly and needlessly dark at times, but this works because it's directly in contrast with the happy-go-lucky attitude of the on-camera world of children's television. Things move along very quickly, but again, that's part of the satire. And yes, there is no shortage of criminally annoying sing-alongs and dance numbers, but you know what they're there for.

Even ones like Very Bad Things. And Election is one of my favorite movies. I also really like most of Danny Devito's other movies (Throw Momma From the Train and War of the Roses).That being said, I didn't like Death to Smoochy. The main reason being that I did not think it was that dark of a comedy.Dark comedy is making patte out of a dog then serving it to its owner (War of the Roses (I know it didn't really happen, but still...)). Its a high school teacher thinking of one of his students as he has sex with his wife (Election). Its systematically killing off your classmates and staging them as liberating suicides (Heathers). All these instances go beyond the social limitations of its time, crossing lines of what people can do to achieve their goals. It is *not* penis-shaped cookies being shown to little kids. That is no more than a plain bathroom sight gag. Nor is it singing kids songs in front of a Nazi convention or having sex with a man in Barney suit. These instances only provide slightly humorous situations, but do not break any social conventions. Dark comedy has to hit you with a mac truck when you're looking the other way. Death to Smoochy taps you on the shoulder, then gives you a bad joke.I keep going over other scenes in Death to Smoochy (the Nazi convention, the ice skating, etc.) and I fail to see the dark humor, or any humor for that matter. Is it only funny because they're hosts of kid shows? I find that to be way too small of a reason to make it humorous. And every other aspect of the movie is generic. In the other movies I mentioned, the humor comes from the twisted things the characters do, and its disturbing regardless of who they are. In Death to Smoochy, no character does anything really outrageous. Rainbow seeks revenge on Smoochy, and does some pretty standard things to get that revenge. What, he plants him at a Nazi convention? Whoopdee-frickin-doo, that's hilarious - sarcasm. A very similar thing happens in Rat Race, which is your standard screwball comedy, and it wasn't terribly funny there either. Then theres the former boxer with no rhythm. He gets a few chuckles here and there, but again, just some standard shtick. Maybe I'm too jaded, but I just didn't find these scenes (or most others, but I won't go into all of them) funny in any respect.The movie does have some funny parts the songs we're pretty good, the cookies got a laugh, and maybe a couple of other scenes. But in the end, where's this dark comedy that everyone talks about? What twisted things do these characters do? I sure can't find them. The characters have some pretty normal desires, and go about fulfilling them in some fairly normal ways, whether it was through a hitman, an agent, or an old fashioned gun. That is *not* dark comedy. Dark comedy would have the characters doing demented things to get the job done, like the ones I mentioned before. The characters in Death to Smoochy do nothing we haven't seen many times before in other movies.And since when do dark comedies have happy endings? Doesn't that go against the standards of a dark comedy? And the ending of Death to Smoochy isn't just happy, its serene. A bad choice in my book.Bottom line if you're a fan of dark comedies, don't expect anything original here. And if you aren't a fan of dark comedies, stay away all together.

Prior to seeing the film, I had liked the trailer and adored the website.  I was all set to embrace Danny Devito's picture about a purply rhino and the psycho wishing to do him harm.But no... Death To Smoochy is a great concept ruined by a poor script.  It feels like Adam Resnick was so enthused by his idea (which is a great one), that he totally forgot to write a decent movie to back it up.  In this age of Barney and Teletubbies, the idea of kid-show satire is badly needed, but this film doesn't come up with the goods.  The sets and props are excellent, the songs enjoyable, but this movie just didn't make me laugh enough to leave feeling satisfied.When I did laugh, it was mostly due to Robin Williams, who shows in Smoochy that he still has his vulgar comic sensibilities.  The character of Rainbow Randolph is one of the few things that *does* work in this movie. Williams' tortured psychotic gets off many of the best lines, and it's a shame he didn't get more screentime.  The rest of the actors try hard, especially the beautiful Catherine Keener, who I cannot stop looking at, but they struggle under the poor script.

Death to Smoochy is, in my opinion, one of the most intelligent, funny, satiric comedies of the year.Smoochy is cast brilliantly, Robin Williams exudes psychosis in his role as Rainbow Randolf.  He delivers a dynamite comedic performance while playing on his character's mental state.  Edward Norton, is absolutely perfect in his casting as Sheldon (Smoochy) Mopes.  He plays his incredibly caring, naive, sensitive character with such innocence and flair, that all that seems to be missing is a gee whiz thrown in here and there.  In the center of these two actors is Nora Wells (played by Catherine Keener), a studio big wig who recruits Smoochy after a legal debacle surrounding Randolf.If you've seen the trailers you know the central plot revolves around Rainbow's despise of Smoochy.  This plot is surrounded by several interesting subplots which give the film intellectual depth.While Williams, Norton, and Keener carry the film, it is fleshed out incredibly well with a great supporting cast of Danny DeVito, Jon Stewart, and Pam Ferris (who plays a hilarious Irish Mob Boss).If you've learn to know and hate current children's TV shows (i.e. Barney, Teletubbies, etc.), you will love Death to Smoochy.  It left me searching for breath to laugh.  It's dialogue is intelligent, funny, and fresh.  The characters, while slightly two dimensional, are real and fun.  And the action is sublimely wicked, dark, and twisted.

Robin is funny as can be in this film, spurting jaw-dropping lines (that are bound to become classic) with his perfect comedic rhythm. Robin earned his paycheck on this film -- Rainbow Randolph is a classic character.The Problems Robin Williams isn't in it hardly enough, unlike the previews might suggest, and when he isn't there the film suffers.

Keener plays the same role she played in Being John Malkovich, showing her lack as an actress. The film just misses opportunities one after the other -- and half the material isn't nearly as fresh as one might have hoped.

You're either the type of person to appreciate the ironic comedy, dark references, and inside jokes, or you aren't. The film offers a great fictional account of the dark underbelly of kids' programming and charities, describing things we don't want to be true, but know, in our hearts, probably ARE true at some level. The film also mixes children's television with sex, death, drugs, murder, extortion, and other scandals. I was surprised DeVito didn't ask Paul Reubens to play a role in Death To Smoochy- The irony of such a cameo would have been delicious!  Death To Smoochy is an inspired, clever film. At no point in it was I left bored or did I feel misdirected by the pace of the story. Everything is well-played. The acting is top-notch, with Williams, Norton, DeVito, Keener, and others giving their best performances in ages. Robin Williams, of course, is being lauded for his return to his comic roots, and it's a well-deserved accolade. Williams hasn't been this funny or entertaining for almost a decade! He's manic, out-of-control, and yet has the glimmer of goodness underneath his mania. He's perfect as Rainbow Randolph.  Keener does what she does best Plays a shrewd, harsh woman who eventually warms up and reveals an intriguingly twisted past (ala Being John Malkovitch). Keener is not the star, however, and is not given any more screen time than she should.  It is Norton, with his squeaky-clean, yet believable Mopes (a.k.a. Smoochy) who steals the show. He's at the top of his game here. He plays the innocent drawn into the lion's den extremely well, and yet this innocence is not ridiculous, and Mopes shows that it's the result of great self-discipline, rather than hopeless, optimistic ignorance. He's good to the bone, and he works hard to stay that way when it would be so easy to just give in and be a creep like everybody who surrounds him.Death To Smoochy will definitely hit cult status. It's got all the markings of a cult-favorite dark comedy which will be placed in the vault of wit for decades to come. People with children might best avoid this film if they want to feel good about letting their kids watch TV or go to ice shows ever again.

Ever wanted to pull a rock star thing and throw the Teletubbies out of a high-rise hotel window? Are you plotting Mr. Wizard's unfortunate accident with his next experiment? If that's how your mind works, then Death to Smoochy, the story of rivalrous child's television show hosts, is for you. As director and co-star Danny DeVito says, We're always looking for movies to take our kids to. This is not that movie! Deservedly rated R, Death to Smoochy is a very dark comedy riffing on a subject overripe for satire. Too bad it doesn't quite work. The irrepressible Robin Williams stars as Rainbow Randolph, the sunny, sparkly top-hatted host of a kiddie TV show, who isn't so perky when the cameras aren't rolling. While in a bar knocking back hard liquor, he gets caught in a bribery scandal and immediately gets the old heave-ho from his employer, Kidnet. The search is on to find a new, squeaky clean host, and when Randolph is replaced by Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton), a scrupled simp whose character is a lovable fuchsia rhinoceros named Smoochy, he hits the skids, big time. Going on a major drinking binge and forced to move in with a midget bit-player from his old show, Randolph plots his revenge against the hapless, happy-go-lucky Sheldon. Catherine Keener plays Nora Wells, a hard-nosed network executive, and Danny DeVito is Burke, Smoochy's unscrupulous agent (complete with pencil moustache). Harvey Fierstein and Jon Stewart shine in supporting roles.The concept is fantastic. The idea of agents and lawyers and plotting and throat-cutting in the seamy underbelly of the candy-coated world of children's television is hilarious. And the movie is mostly funny -- I just think it could have been better had Danny DeVito written the script, and someone like Woody Harrelson had been cast as the moralistic, naturalistic hippy-dippy Smoochy. Norton is one of my favorite actors of all time, but I do feel he was miscast as Smoochy. There's nothing wrong with a little typecasting now and then; in this case, going against type really didn't pan out. I did get chuckles out of Death to Smoochy, and there were a few laugh-out-loud detours (there's a scene in which Randolph bakes some rather interesting cookies for Smoochy, and another where he disguises himself as an accent-challenged limo driver), but it just didn't quite hit the target of excellence I expect from DeVito as a director.The movie could have been a killer black comedy, but as it turns out Death to Smoochy is only near-fatal.

As you might've guessed, the `Barney' and `Teletubbies' references are ancient and are relied all throughout for a non-existent laugh.Robin Williams is a great comic actor but his talents are terribly wasted in this film.  He wears out his welcome almost immediately and resorts to ad-libbing penis jokes in front of children.   It becomes irritatingly clear that the `dark and demented' DeVito's idea of satire is dated pop-culture allusions and having people who make children's shows drop the f-bomb every other word.  Weak.  Williams is supposed to be loathsome, but he's so good at it it's not fun.Edward Norton is too sugary to swallow and Catherine Keener does more eye-rolling than acting (plus they have no romantic chemistry whatsoever).  DeVito is a stereotype, Jon Stewart is barely used, and Harvey Fierstein doesn't cut it as a gangster.  Sure, there were a few funny moments (I laughed good and hard at the `Step-dad Song') but those moments were few and far between as the characters are too one-dimensional and all the bright colors were giving me a headache.  Maybe instead of attacking the commercialism of kid's programming, DeVito could've done better by going after the movie theater industry's overpriced popcorn and soda I consumed while watching this junk.  At least that would've seemed to have a purpose.  Still want to see `Smoochy'? Fine, just save your money and rent it.

Williams is as manic as ever, and Norton is wonderfully naïve.  I can't get over how versatile he is considering his roles in Fight Club, American History X, and Primal Fear.I was expecting Death to Smoochy to be on the same plane as classic satires, like Network, but aside from a few great lines and the infamous and hilarious stepfather song, the film was not nearly as dark as it could have been.  DeVito seems to think that profanity and violence creates a sneering dark comedy, but truly great films, like The Royal Tenenbaums, are able to be darker still without the violence, but rather through the story and characters.Visually the film is colorful and lively with great sets, extras, and particularly costumes.  And the ice skating climax and all scenes on the Smoochy TV set are pure entertainment.Every joke doesn't fly, but the ones that do hit hard, and they come quick enough that you barely even notice.So, in summary, Death to Smoochy is a hilarious and highly entertaining mock of children's television and the blatant exploitation of this deep-pocketed demographic with a satirical edge, but not as much substance as style.

Finally we get to see his range as he explores this dark and tortured character. Williams has most of the funny scenes, as usual, and as suits him well. This role is different in the type of humor Williams displays. Think raw. Yes he swears a lot, but he's supposed to be a bad man. If you don't like the language or suggested violence, go watch Hook instead.One of the most surprising and interesting characters is portrayed by Edward Norton. Not since Fight Club has Norton taken on a role so convincingly as to make you truly understand the character. This is true acting. Norton's Smoochy mirrors the pure sugary sweet sappy attitude of Mr. Rogers and Barney the Dinosaur combined.Danny Devito has taken a clever script and taken risks as a director which ultimately pay off. Atypical characters from Williams and Norton add to the quirky directing style that really captures the mood of the film. Here is a black comedy as dark as can be but still funny.If you ever found yourself daydreaming of strangling Barney the Dinosaur, or any other really annoying children's TV icon, then this is the movie for you!

The cast and creators have done excellent work before, which is why this soggy film is especially disappointing.  It's not without humor the song about stepfathers is brilliant, and there are inspired one-liners here and there.  But overall, the movie is inexplicably repetitive and uninspired.  Once the main conflict of the movie is established (Rainbow Randolph wants his job back while Smoochy brings his uplifting schtick to children's TV), the story simply limps around in circles. The plot throws in sequences about organized crime, but the characters just keep repeating themselves until the ice skating climax.  You know a movie is in trouble when a lead character is continually asked to roll her eyes or snort in surprise/indignation, and unfortunately, that's Catherine Keener's main job.  It's difficult to watch her with nothing to do here if you've recently seen her in the brilliant BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.  It's good to see Robin Williams cast off the sappy good guy roles he has recently been playing, but his character is strangely without dimension.  His lines depend on empty profanities, which come across as more and more hollow as the movie unfolds.  Danny DeVito's hyper directing style doesn't help much either--a scene in super closeup between DeVito and Harvey Fierstein is as irksome as it is unsensible.In short, a disappointing movie that fails to take advantage of its very ripe-for-satirizing subject matter.

If you don't understand that remark, you're not going to like this movie.This movie's promotion suggested a one-joke ordeal. I'm not a fan of Throw Momma or Robin Williams movies, and I had zero interest in War of the Roses. But after some coaxing I watched this, and was pleasantly surprised at the places it went, and the obscene zeal it found in two children's TV hosts one of whom despises the other. The super-vulgar one with no self-control hates the big purple thing who's insufferably P.C.. It is inconceivable that this received the drubbing it did, from the public and especially the critics. We've endured so much heinous children's television over the years, and so many awful child actors, that an original comedy as funny as this was a long time coming. It's a put-on people, laugh a little! Every scene includes at least a titter. Even pratfalls (the lamest type of humor in the canon) get a fresh treatment here. DTS may be the most garish-looking movie ever filmed though.The deliriously nasty joke of the movie is that a plethora of syndicates, grifters and venal self-promoters are behind children's TV. If you can make it through authentically annoying, naff, didactic kiddie songs like My Stepdads Not Mean, He's Just Adjusting (and that's one of the better ones) you'll reach streams of vivid, limber expletives and plot situations which are a joy to behold. The script which frequently becomes rote, always snaps back with something shockingly vulgar. When the movie reaches a children's Wagner on Ice show, I was still chuckling.Robin Williams plays a hilariously foul-mouthed malcontent. One of my favorite lines involves comparing a woman's virtue to the Titanic but I won't ruin it. Instead I'll leave you with a Joe Orton line in the same vein You? You were born with your legs spread. They'll have to bury you in Y-shaped coffin. Catherine Keener as a children's TV exec/mascot fetishist again shows off the fresh, direct, natural acting technique that she first displayed in Being John Malkovich.The Irish mob boss named Tommy (female) is a great character, memorable for, among other things, a particularly direct way of grieving Alright boys, let's go pray and get sh***aced.Just as with most DVD commentaries DeVito's remarks are a pointless description of only what's in front of your eyes, without even a sentence of explanation of the origins of this original script. But at least he draws your attention to some interesting edits. I only caught about half the fun he was having with film technique.

From the moment I heard about it, there was a lot I liked about the idea. It was absurd, it was dark, and it was different. What I found, however, was that it tried too hard to be different, and in trying, it failed to become what it could have.Essentially what we have is a comedy, dark at times, funny at times, but not quite one or the other. It's not a black comedy, because it's too ridiculous; the best black comedies are simply not funny, because they're too grotesquely real. Conversely, it's not quite a straight comedy because it just isn't witty enough; it relies too heavily on stereotypes and hyperbole for its humour. At times it seems to be a biting satire of children's television, but it fails in this respect too, because it doesn't have a firm enough grounding in reality. The best satire (call it Swiftean, if you will) also shouldn't be funny, because it's too vivid a mirror for reality.Death to Smoochy is too warped, you could say. It fails to really hit the highs of the peak it attempts to climb, because it takes it one step too far in every respect. Its humour relies on a farcical nature that is just too extreme to work every time. The character of Sheldon is overworked; likewise Rainbow Randolph. I mean, we've seen green-loving hippies before, it's nothing new, and so too have we seen Robin Williams in crazy ranting mode, and it's funnier when he's not such a clichéd 'psycho' character.The film does, however, have its moments For example, the zoom-out from the costumed Spinner's dead body to a chalk outline of a giant foam rhinoceros - that made me laugh for a twisted, absurdly poignant minute. That's the chord I feel the entire film was trying to hit, that - to clumsily continue the metaphor - 'diminished' chord. But moments like that that made me laugh - and I wouldn't want to deny that there were a few - were isolated. There wasn't a coherent enough flow to make these amusing moments string together into a funny, witty, truly memorable whole.And I think it's basically just a lack of coherence that causes its downfall. IT doesn't even know what it's trying to do. Because the really tragic thing is, as I knew before I watched it, that there are so many good elements here. The cast is great, not just on paper but they all attack their roles with gusto (with the possibly notable exception of Jon Stewart, who I think is quite amusing in real life, but he's not a great actor). The concept behind the plot, if not necessarily the plot as it unfolds, is amusing and original. Danny De Vito directs with a stylistic hand, and he clearly enjoys what he's putting together here. All in all, it really could have been something more than it is.But basically, funny though it is, it doesn't have enough to set it apart from other 'funny' films. It's different, certainly, but not in the way that Bringing Up Baby is different from, say, Cheaper by the Dozen (Not the greatest comparison I've ever devised, but I hope you get the general idea). In the end, I have to join that rather succinct mob who inadvertently inspired me to watch this film, and say It's just weird. "},{"Title":"Stop! The flames are too hot!

I saw the movie almost a week ago and every time I think about (which is a lot!) I just start laughing. 'Death to Smoochy' was a movie that always lingered on the periphery of my rental appetites; I'd heard so many bad things about it that you can't help but believe the hype. When it came out I couldn't find a single person who liked it or who wanted to like it and I think that maybe that's why I stayed away from it. A few years later I've had some distance and rediscovered it. All I can say is I'm so glad I did! 'Death to Smoochy' was part of Robin Williams self-described 'Triptych of Terror.' Along with 'Insomnia' and 'One Hour Photo,' he tried to set out and play characters very different from his past choices. People will argue about how they these performances were received initially, but I think they all have an edge and a complexity that easily outdistances a lot of his earlier work. His performance as Rainbow Randolph in 'Death to Smoochy' is the most comedic of his three dark turns. He is a man unhinged as his world is collapsing all around him, and realizing that he's fettered away or lost what little of anything he once had. His anguish turns to rage and his rage focuses in on his rival 'Smoochy.' Rival may not be the right word there since it insinuates two combatants. 'Smoochy' is so good-hearted and well-intentioned that he is largely oblivious to the machinations of the man whose time slot on network television he has stolen.'Death to Smoochy' is VICIOUSLY satirical. Very strong performances from Williams, Devito, and the always excellent Catherine Keener. Edward Norton is a bit of a revelation who knew the guy could be funny? Vincent Schiavelli plays a children's performer even farther down on his his luck and more desperate than Williams' Randolph. Littered with great character actors, this is a wonderfully dark and irreverent film that has three main themes 1. How far will a man go to get back what he's lost, 2. How strongly will one defend one's principles, and 3. Corruption through greed and how avarice can destroy those it ensnares.This is a wonderful film that deserves a second chance. My rating may go up for it in time. If you're looking for a satirically dark, edgy comedy that skewers network politics, uber-healthy lifestyles and children's programming (hey, throw in ice shows too!) than this is the film for you.

The plot is intriguing(no, honestly, it is; you wouldn't think so from the outline, but it really is), though it develops strangely. The pacing is somewhat uneven, but it does move as it should during some parts... I'd say about half of the movie is blessed with good pacing, while the other half... yes, I'm afraid so. The acting is mostly solid. The writing is... out there, very much. Occasionally funny, but more often than not, it's just weird. The comedians are all pretty funny here, though I found that Jon Stewart had an almost criminally small part compared to how funny the man is. With some bizarre humor and various musical numbers, this film is an odd one. Well, when the first few moments are a shadow-play of the host of a children's show getting murdered, you know you're in for an unusual film. I haven't seen too many other movies directed by Danny DeVito... in fact, this is the first. Anyway, therefore, I can't really say if this is typical for him or not.

You have to be very open minded to not think this is a silly waste of your time. Its a satire of the children's television world, likening it to the viciousness and competitiveness of big business - but you have to ask yourself, why? Why was this an important subject of satire? It wasn't, really. A highly insignificant film, about a peppy do-gooder, Edward Norton (Primal Fear, American History X) who takes over the timeslot of established kids TV old hat Robin Williams, oblivious to the network politics behind him. Robin Williams spends most of the movie looking more scary than funny as the ex-kids' TV star gone deranged and bent on executing his revenge on the man who took it all away from him, peppy Norton.My family began throwing things at the television ten minutes in, and left the room twenty minutes in. You probably won't be as patient as i was, staying till the end, mostly from sheer morbid curiosity. Stinkers rarely come as bad as this. But what can you expect, from Danny DeVito directing.

It is a black comedy; you will laugh at things you won't like laughing at, or just be plain disgusted.  If you like dark comedy however, it is a masterpiece.  The film is set in the Children's entertainment industry and the corruption therein.  Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) is convicted of accepting Payola and he is removed from the network.  The search is on now for a suitable replacement, a person that is as clean and virtuous as they can get.  They find Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton) aka Smoochy the Rhino.  Mopes' virtue in the film (it's like they dragged him from Berkley, CA circa 1970) sharply contrasts the industry that is supposed to help and entertain children, making its corruption that much more prominent.  Here you have charities that order hits, the Irish mob protecting children's stars and Randolph's decent into madness and alcoholism.  Makes me laugh.If your favorite films of Robin Williams are Awakenings and What Dreams May Come, you will not like his character.  If you like his stand-up and his role in The Fisher King, you will probably like his role.  He plays it very over the top and, in my opinion, his is the best part of the film. Everyone else does a great job too, though it is hard to see Harvey Firestein in an intimidating role.  It is well shot and well directed.  It is dark, depressing and hilarious, like an episode of 60 Minutes with a laugh track. Watch with caution.

I'd missed it at the cinema (It wasn't on for long, if at all, if my memory serves me correctly) and it's taken me a long time to finally rent it. Ultimately though, it was probably worth the wait.In Death To Smoochy we're introduced to Rainbow Randolph Smiley (played with manic energy by Robin Williams). Randolph, a beloved children's presenter is fired after being arrested for fixing who's child goes on the front row. Eager to avoid another catastrophe, the tv executives hire Shelton Mopes (Ed Norton) to bring Mopes' dinosaur Smoochy to children's tv. This leaves Randolph bitter, twisted, and desperate for revenge.In this movie, the partnership of Williams and Norton is, to say the least, genius. Williams as the insane Randolph and Norton as the ridiculously camp, morally perfect Shelton, are an amazing duo leading a solid cast on a route of daft laughs. With a lively colour scheme and a twisted sense of humour, we're presented to the extreme world of children's television which is not quite as innocent as it might seem.Truth be told, there's not much which can be said about Death To Smoochy. The movie has a solid plot line with some amazing jokes, the problem though is that something just doesn't seem to click. It's a good enough piece of entertainment to be able to sit and just mellow out to, but it doesn't feel like it quite has the edge to really be up there amongst those films I'd consider buying and watching over and over again. I'd love to know what it is which makes the movie feel wrong, but I really don't have a clue. Perhaps it's me, I'm not sure. All I know is that this movie makes me laugh and it makes me smile, but it doesn't really hit me hard. It's not hilarious, it's just nice.

The key word here is at -- I didn't laugh with it; I didn't laugh about it. I laughed at it.Smoochy is a horrible, terrible unbelievably bad movie. I can think of no film that is quite so ill-conceived, tasteless and heavy-handed, yet done with such arrogant self assurance. The fact that director Danny De Vito and writer Adam Resnick don't realize just how awful their material really is makes it all rather sad. The fact that they blindly trudged onward and downward in total ignorance of the mess they are making is sadly hilarious.The premise is promising. Two rival kiddie show hosts - - one corrupt and evil, the other absurdly innocent and sweet -- battle for the hearts and minds of America's toddlers. You know the satire will be heavy-handed and obvious from the first scene There we see Robin Williams (as Rainbow Randolph, the evil host) dance around on the set of his TV show, which is decorated by giant dollar signs. How obvious can you get? What follows includes a lot of foul language, mob executions, Nazi rallies, tasteless ethnic stereotyping and unrelentingly stupid plot twists. By the time the ending rolls around -- which involves an assassination attempt at a children's ice-capades performance -- any hope of the film being even slightly logical or even mildly clever have long since died. And is there anything as tragically unfunny as plotting to kill a kids show host in an auditorium full of toddlers? What kind of sick mind would even hope to make this funny?Yet, I laughed at it. Not while watching it, but afterward, on the way home. I couldn't help myself. I sat at stop lights and just broke out laughing. I laughed at how desperate the filmmakers were to get a laugh. I laughed at how insipid the story was and how clumsy each plot twist was belched into the narrative. I laughed at how outrageously silly and offensive the film got. I laughed the loudest remembering out utterly dim-witted the closing credits were. My laughs were cruel, but after enduring two hours of stumbling stupidity, I think I earned the right to be cruel.What I didn't laugh at were the poor actors. I had nothing but pity for most of the pathetic (if well paid) wretches who were trapped in this mess. Though I can praise Edward Norton for the consistent sweetness of his performance as the benignly insipid Smoochy, I cannot be so generous to Williams, Once again given free reign to mug and riff and shamelessly overact, he runs amok, and not in the good Robin Williams way.To it's credit, DEATH TO SMOOCHY is a unique motion picture. Not since the 1960's -- which gave us stuff like YELLOW SUBMARINE, MYRA BRECKENRIDGE, CASINO ROYALE and SKI-DOO -- has a film had the nerve to be so unpredictably absurd. But those films at least could argue that they were heavily influenced by drugs. SMOOCHY presumably was made by sober people with clear intentions, which in itself is a scary notion.

Norton being the great actor he is, and Williams also having done some very good drama work recently, and even his comedy was good, this film is neither too funny nor has any dramatic feel. It's a Rated-R film, but feels like its made for 5 year old throughout. After seeing this, I think Danny DeVito should definitely think about what he is directing. A silly story about a children show host (Williams) who loses his job to a man named Sheldon Mopes (Norton) who makes a rhino character called Smoochy. The former host who gets fired because of Mopes now wants revenge. The film is not a dark comedy, most of it wasn't funny. At best it had some interesting over the top scenes. Catherine Keener was decent in her role, Danny DeVito probably had the best performance of the film, Robin Williams was annoyingly over the top, easily the worst I have seen him, Norton was decent, not himself though, it's the first bad performance I have seen from Norton. It had an interesting plot, and if done right, could have been an interesting film, but it seemed like DeVito was trying to make a dark humor film, without the humor!. 6/10 "}{"Title":"Death to Smoochy is GREAT!!!","Date":"4 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I remember when this first hit the theater I really wanted to see it, but as fate would have it I wasn't able to get myself to the theater in time to see it.  I couldn't believe how quickly this film was in and out of the theaters.  I saw the trailers for it and couldn't believe that it could be THAT bad.  So, finally the film came out to DVD and I wasted no time in renting it.  Death to Smoochy is awesome!  I makes me so sad that it didn't do very well in the theater.  The cast is awesome, the story is hilarious, the acting great, the directing is top-notch, everything about this film is great.Edward Norton is a truly gifted actor, and he plays the part of Sheldon Mopes perfectly!  His character is awesome and extremely well done.  Then you throw Robin Williams into the mix, a great actor as well, a bit of a different turn from his typical roles, but nonetheless pulls it off.  It seems weird to hear Robin Williams cuss, but it works well in the film and definitely with the character.  Catherine Keener deserves some notice as well, not a terribly well known actress, but hopefully she will be someday.  Great actress!  Danny DeVito, Michael Rispoli, Jon Stewart and Harvey Fierstein also deserve some notice, they all play their parts very well.I will admit however, that this film is definitely not for everyone.  I can surely see why some people would dislike it and why this wouldn't appeal to a lot of people.  It's not a happy story and it's definitely got a great deal of dark humor to it.  Dark comedies are usually not my cup of tea, but there is something about this film that I really like.Like I said this film isn't going to appeal to everyone, so I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.  I guess, if the trailer makes the film look interesting to you and you like dark comedies then go for it.  If you're simply a fan of the one the actors, then be my guest, check it out.

First off, it had Robin Williams in it. I hadn't seen Robin Williams do anything worth seeing for quite some time, and for some reason the film spoke to me, like the voice in Field of Dreams. Second, it had Ed Norton in it, who is one of the most careful actors in Hollywood today. He only chooses movies that he knows are worth his involvement, and I must say thank goodness he believed in this. And finally, it was directed by Danny DeVito, who has always had my respect as a hilarious guy and a fine filmmaker. When I heard he was directing this film and that it was, in fact, a comedy that was rated R, I immediately called my buddy Jason (who was thinking the exact same thing by this point) and in March of 2002, we headed for the cinemas. Every aspect of Death to Smoochy sets it apart from any film I've seen in the past four years. Not only did it have a stunning cast and a truly original story, but it was also unbelievably funny. This was a film that both my friend and I felt was made specifically for us. It had a style of humor that is usually lacking in all comedies of present. And the actors performing those lines couldn't have done a better job. We were two out of probably five people in the theatre, including the father of the year that brought his two five year old children to see it. Apparently the large R rating that was branded across the screen didn't convince him that there was any reason to doubt this movie would be appropriate for his toddlers. I think after the first expletive was uttered, a whopping three or four minutes into the feature, dad should have probably known where this was going. But no, he and his children remained through every single hilarious minute. From the dill-dough cookie to the Jersey Nazi rally, Death to Smoochy was a roller coaster ride of unbelievably hilarious proportions, even if it was definitely not appropriate for children. But hey, that's why we have a rating system. The cinematography was surprisingly well thought out and classy, done in such a way that made Death to Smoochy rise from being just another Hollywood comedy to an original venture that no one can lay claim to. I own the DVD and bought it the day it came out, and every time I watch it I see or hear something new. The color schemes they used in the film were completely believable and yet surprisingly meaningful. You see the brightness of the characters' wardrobe and immediately are reminded of cartoons or other children's' programming. Nora and Sheldon wear complimentary colors every time they are around each other, and creates an almost subconscious acceptance of their relationship. Everything looks soft and almost innocent, when the harsh dialogue and rough situations stand as a direct contrast. The film is an amazingly woven quilt of comedy, tenderness, edge, intrigue, and silliness. I commend Danny DeVito (unlike nearly every other critic out there) for his decision to take on this edgy, original, ambitious script and breathe such life into it that it literally leapt off the pages and did the jiggy ziggy dance.

The storyline and subtext beneath it demand humor; the television business is so jaded and ugly (represented by Keener, DeVito, and Stewart's characters) that rather than turning this into another Network the catch was to make it as outrageous as possible.  All the elements of contrast (Smoochy vs. Rainbow Randolph) and added elements of corruption (Tommy Cotter and Spinner) are so uncalled for in such an expose, you can't help but laugh.Robin Williams tears right at your gut with Rainbow Randolph at the end of his mental rope, while Pam Ferris and Michael Rispoli make me laugh even harder with their totally hilarious Irish Mafia bit.  The entire cast comes together as a fabulous ensemble.

I rented it on instinct -- sure, the movie had been slammed by countless people yet there was something about it that reached for my attention.The premise of the movie is simple Rainbow Randy the clown (Robin Williams) takes a bribe involving the placement of a person in the show. The people he conducts this transaction with are undercover agents; Randy is arrested, the media is notified, his show on Kidsnet is cancelled, et cetera. This triggers the need for Nora Wells (Catherine Keener) to find a drop-in replacement for the show. She finds him -- Sheldon Mopes who will become Smoochy the Rhino -- in a methadone clinic where he plays a guitar and sings melodies for the maintenance patients. She offers him a contract to host a television show and he accepts. Randy plots various acts of revenge multiple times throughout the movie.That out of the way, I can't say enough good about this movie. Superb acting and the exponential amount of humor present in this movie is almost supernatural.

He finds himself wrapped up in the dark side of children's television, tangling with merchandising-happy TV execs, corrupt charity workers, Irish thugs and kiddie show hosts who prove to be grown-ups after all, and learns just how well a disguise sincerity can be.  Robin Williams is well cast as Rainbow Randolph, the corrupt clown Smoochy replaces, playing sweet and scary to the hilt.  No doubt this story took some inspiration from the Pee-Wee Herman scandal!

The first thing out my best friend's mouth when we left was I am ready to see it again., my wife and I agreed. Few films, or stories in any medium, have thought to attack the subjects this film does and none have achieved the level of thoughtfulness, humor and pure enjoyment.  The morals of this story are simple and clear, not that they don't show the complexity of life and every situation, but it makes clear that there are basic ideals that most folks agree with and try to live by and that no matter how dark and/or difficult things may seem, if you let things like the Golden Rule influence your thinking process, things will work out for the best in the end. Oh yeah, if Barney, the Tella Tubies, or the Beatles (All You Need is Love) bug you this film's thrashing of them as well as elevating them will make you feel better.  Few folks can combine Dark humor with Lite humor and serious issues in a way that make you not only pay attention, but love the ride no matter where it takes you.

Judging by the fullness of the foliage and the ways in which the people are dressed, we can ascertain that the scene was shot sometime in the spring or summer.  Yet, by the time the car has arrived at its destination, the setting is engulfed in a full-on blizzard, appropriately enough since the film does indeed take place in wintertime Manhattan.This seemingly minor technical discrepancy is actually emblematic of the carelessness and cluelessness that have gone into the making of this black comedy misfire, written by Adam Resnik and directed by Danny De Vito.  Pity the two unlucky stars who are stuck playing rival kiddie show hosts who find themselves involved in a battle from which only one can emerge victorious.  Williams portrays Rainbow Randolph Smiley, on camera, a beaming, saccharine purveyor of upbeat lessons in morality and life, off camera, a foulmouthed, amoral moneygrubber who gets busted for taking payola from some undercover agents posing as parents desperate to get their child a coveted spot on Smiley's TV show.  Norton plays Smoochy, a down-on-his-luck, wannabe star whose moral métier is the exact opposite of Smiley's.  He is decent, kind and honest to a fault, a man who balks at all the corporate exploitation of children done in the name of entertainment and profit.  When Smoochy is hired to be Smiley's replacement, the mentally unbalanced has-been launches a diabolical crusade to undercut the rising star's ascent to the top and to regain his own lost position of prominence in the hearts and minds of his adoring fans and the corporate execs and sponsors who happen to pay the bills.It's sort of hard to know what exactly those involved with this enterprise really thought they were doing.  The corrupt world of so-called `children's entertainment'- where more money is spent trying to get the tykes and their parents to buy tie-in products than in trying to instill strong moral values into the intended audience - is certainly rife for some clear-eyed deconstruction.  `Death to Smoochy,' however, fails at every level &#150; the prime problem being that there is not a single laugh to be found anywhere in the movie.  Any attempt to bring pop-eyed gangsters, hired hit men and Nazi storm troopers into a satire about a kiddie show in crisis had better know what it is doing from the outset.  `Death to Smoochy' never gets a sure footing.  Smiley and Smoochy are too broadly drawn to be very interesting or effective as characters and the humor generally consists of people cussing at one another while an innocent, angelic Smoochy looks on in finger-wagging disapproval.  The low point of the movie occurs when a deranged Smiley waves a giant cookie made in the shape of a penis right in the faces of a group of astonished children while he enumerates each and every one of the terms commonly associated with that object.  This seems to be a new low even for Hollywood, which obviously no longer acknowledges the existence of any line separating what is appropriate for adults from what is appropriate for children.Typical for a mainstream film that presumes to dabble in the area of `dark' comedy, `Death to Smoochy' turns all soft, cuddly and righteous at the end.  Yet, what a film of this sort needs is a hard edge, a willingness to go all the way into the realm of iconoclastic satire and not want the audience to pat it on the back as it leaves the theatre.   De Vito made such a film a dozen or so years back.  It was called `The War of the Roses.'  That film had the courage of its convictions and still boasts one of the bravest and darkest endings ever to adorn a mainstream American movie. `Death to Smoochy' is, ultimately, as treacly and bland as the target it is trying to attack.

His show is very successful, Randolph is furious and jealous, but it is Mopes' agent, the slimy Burke Bennett (DeVito) who is trying to get Smoochy killed. In a finale on ice, a beautiful kids' show, a shooter is aiming at Smoochy but the plot is foiled, the shooter falls from above to his death on ice, and Burke is exposed as the crook.

This gag is used numerous times throughout the film, and it is never creative or funny. Most of the other scenes consist of Norton spouting some New Age nonsense that isn't funny because it's meant to be funny, not sincere; or Robin Williams acting manic. Unfortunately after about 20 years of being manic Robin Williams, the routine's a little stale.There is another adult-oriented movie about childrens' entertainers called Shakes the Clown that succeeds where this one fails precisely because that movie has the decency to wallow in its own crassness. Robin Williams appears in both movies; given the general lack of quality of his comedy as his years have progressed, it should not be surprising that Shakes is his better performance. Makes one wonder about the wisdom of giving up cocaine. I mean, I'm glad for his health that he's off the pipe, but he used to be funny. Remember Mork?Smoochie never finds its tone, and thus fails as entertainment. I cannot think of a single film that has successfully blended adult situations, juvenile humor, feigned sincerity about the welfare of children, and violence. Possibly because there is no worthwhile story that would require such a recipe. In attempting to appeal to every demographic, every focus group, Smoochie succeds admirably in being a thoroughly mediocre and forgettable film in all respects.Of the movie's many shortcomings, I must admit one in particular bothers me. Henry Rollins should have gotten the role as Spinner. I don't say this because I believe Rollins is a particularly good actor; the point is that the role required someone who was believable as a psychotic, punch-drunk retired boxer. Rollins has the energy and focus to deliver such a character. The guy they got just doesn't. He fails to take over his scenes, which is what a manic character is supposed to do - how can you be manic and be secondary in your scenes? Rollins tells a great story about how he lost this role by being too enthusiastic about it - that story is much funnier than anything in this fiasco.Through the entire running time of this movie I encountered two jokes that made me chuckle the stepfather song and a one-liner by a thug about the differences between law enforcement and mob violence. The rest is unbearable. Don't suffer my fate. Rent Shakes the Clown instead.

Viewers wanting a good laugh instead have had to suffer through the likes of the mediocre Showtime to outright junk like All About the Benjamins, Sorority Boys, and Big Trouble.Death to Smoochy, directed by Danny DeVito (who also co-stars), definitely falls into the latter category. A black comedy about a kiddie show mascot who is marked for death is a concept that looked promising on paper. Too bad that it stinks so badly on the big screen. Labeling this a comedy is truly a misnomer, because it has as much humor as DeVito has height.Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) is a kiddie-show host who is swiftly fired after taking a bribe. His replacement is Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton), who spends his days playing guitar to a group of listless addicts in a Coney Island drug rehabilitation clinic. Nora Wells (Catherine Keener), television producer for the cable channel KidNet, offers Randolph's time slot to Mopes, and he immediately jumps at the opportunity. Hence the creation of Smoochy, a big purple rhinoceros (and obvious ripoff of Barney) whose new show immediately shoots to the top of the ratings. Needless to say, Randolph is much displeased about this and, as the title suggests, he'll use any means in his power to get his job back, even if he has to resort to murder.As a result of Adam Resnick's awful script and DeVito's inmates-running-the-asylum directing style, this film is so flat and lifeless that it's in dire need of a defibrillator. It's as bad as Benjamins when it comes to forcing unfunny humor down our throats. Are we really expected to laugh at dialogue like I'll be back after I take a dump?Nothing about Smoochy is humorous at all, unless you enjoy watching a troupe of distinguished actors continuously make asses of themselves. The script focuses too much on overwrought and underwhelming physical comedy, and as a result there is absolutely zero character development. We don't know anything about these guys, except for the fact that Mopes wants to save the drug clinic after it's suddenly shut down. There is not one individual worth rooting for in this mishmash, not even the do-gooder Mopes with his endless health-nut propaganda. While not busy being harassed by Randolph, he and Nora regularly butt heads over creative differences.Meanwhile, Williams' role as Randolph is right up there with past disasters like Jack, Bicentennial Man and Fathers' Day. If he's not busy cussing up a storm, he's busy getting thrown headfirst into walls and down flights of stairs, and ends up with barely a bruise or scratch each time. At one point when a gang of charity-organization heavies (featuring Harvey Fierstein as leader Merv Green) roughs Randolph up, including bodyslamming him to the hardwood floor of his apartment and clobbering him in numerous and sundry ways, Randolph shrugs it off and is back on his feet in a matter of seconds. Even those who can suspend disbelief at the drop of a hat will find this ridiculous. He has a chance to redeem himself in the upcoming Al Pacino film Insomnia. At this point, he can go nowhere but up.When the characters aren't arguing or exchanging banal dialogue, every other scene is of Randolph throwing a temper tantrum in one way or another. Most of the time, these outbursts do nothing to advance the microscopic plot. For no reason, he assaults a man collecting money to save an endangered species of rhinoceros. Before that, he douses himself with gasoline and threatens to touch himself with a lit match. Try to guess what happens next.If the truly asinine supporting characters of a mentally-challenged ex-boxer and a junkie hitman are supposed to have us rolling in the aisles, then I must already be an old codger at twenty-six.Smoochy is so desperate for laughs that it stoops to unscrupulous lows. The eponymous purple rhino makes an appearance at a Nazi rally, complete with huge swastika banners and the familiar hand salute. (Mopes gets in this situation after being set up by Randolph, but of course nobody believes him.) Randolph barges onto the set of Smoochy's show and unleashes a dozen euphemisms of the male genitalia in an attempt to humiliate him on national television. The usage of sexual metaphors worked to hilarious effect in Mrs. Doubtfire, but it miserably crashes and burns here. While he talks, he waves an anatomically correct cookie &#150; the subject of his verbal barrage &#150; at a group of small children. One can only imagine their parents having a collective heart attack as this scene was being filmed. The climax, which takes place at an ice show (complete with concession stands selling soy dogs, organic smoothies and salt-free pretzels), is so anticlimactic and predictable that there's no feeling of satisfaction; during the sappy end credits sequence, you're instead wondering about plot holes left open at the end.It's revealed in the credits that Smoochy's ice skating scenes were choreographed and performed by Elvis Stojko. Good Lord, he goes from being an Olympian to this?Much more dirt could be dug up regarding this abomination, but it's simply not worth the effort. To make a long story short, watch Ice Age instead if you really want to enjoy a movie about imaginary talking animals. I had previously said that Resident Evil was the worst film of the new millennium. Well, now it has a companion. One's company and two's definitely a crowd. 1/10  "},{"Title":"Impressively miscast incoherence","Date":"14 March 2007","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" Impressive movie - for piling up stupid story, stupid casting, stupid clichés and stupid costumes, all then delivered by first-rate and good actors. Quite incredible.Why didn't Edward Norton play the villain and Robin Williams the supposedly adorable rhino Smoochy, rather than Williams as villain and Norton as cuddly (which he is not)? That's the mystery I watched the movie through for. Fabulously miscast. Norton's a great actor. So is Williams. But for opposite kinds of roles! Someone on the set must have noticed this, so why didn't they switch? Maybe they realized the whole movie was so horribly candy-floss dumb anyway, so rather than make the best of things they went for a mind-blowingly messed-up bad fantasy effect, hoping it might improve something? Looks that way. Seldom have I experienced so little suspension of disbelief through a movie. Rather, my disbelief was constantly activated throughout. To the point that Robin Williams' wild improvisations became islands of believability, in at least his comic talent.Is this a children's movie or for adults? Looks like a children's movie, but dialogue quite adult (at times very) - the mixing is baffling a badly controlled contrast.Directed by Danny DeVito this film must have been a get-together as a favour to him and party for the actors.Hard to believe money was spent making this film - that's what I need to suspend my disbelief about here.1 star out of 10 (rather than unrated) mostly for the daring psychedelic colours (though clashing with the story the way, say, meat dyed green clash with taste), and some of Williams' jokes.
