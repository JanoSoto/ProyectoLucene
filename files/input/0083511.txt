Accept no imitations.","Date":"15 January 2003","Score":"53 out of 61 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  This is the one of the movies that kicked off the buddy cop formula.  Technically, Nick Nolte's the only cop, but other films have tried to imitate the style by having a tough, cranky, by-the-book cop (Nolte's character) paired off with a loose, easygoing, unorthodox cop (like Murphy's character).  Some of these imitators have failed miserably and even those that succeeded don't match up to 48 Hours.  I haven't seen the unedited version of this movie in over ten years (it plays on TV like 4 times every month), and even when I did catch it on TV, I caught it in bits and pieces.  Now that I've seen it straight-through, in its uncut form, I can regard this as an overlooked classic.  Watching Nolte as the gruff, chain-smoking Jack, I thought to myself, He owns that part.  Many actors have tried to take on that same role, but nobody plays it better than Nolte.  And the same goes for Eddie Murphy.  His talent has been taken for granted over the recent years, since his career has hit a major slump.  And rightfully so.  He should choose his roles much more wisely.  How do you from doing such fun, memorable films as 48 Hours, Coming to America and Trading Places to doing Showtime and I-Spy.  This movie proves that Murphy can go leaps and bounds with his comic talent, if the script is well-written.  The scene in the all-white, country-western bar, where Murphy shows off his skills as an interrogator, is a classic. The film is directed by Walter Hill, who's great at directing action sequences.  So the movie packs a punch in both the action and comedy department.  Nolte and Murphy's chemistry is priceless, and the banter between them is sharp and hilarious.  One of my favorite examples is when Murphy asks Nolte, Can you tell me a bedtime story?  Nolte responds, F**k you.  That's my favorite one.  Of course, Murphy gets most of the credit for being the comic relief, and he is terrific in one of his best comic performances, but Nolte belts out just as many funny lines as him, though he's the official straight man.  He never seems to say anything intentionally funny, but that's what's funny.  He says things that are hilarious, but sounds dead serious about them.  And of course, it's also hilarious to watch him react furiously to Murphy's taunts. Those who haven't seen 48 Hours should really check it out, because it's an action classic!  Sure, the Rush Hour films are good, but Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan don't have close to the same magic as Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy!  THIS is how an action/comedy is made!!My score  9 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"Pretty entertaining thanks to great performances from the two leads...","Date":"12 April 2001","Score":"26 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"     It's the chemistry between Nolte and Murphy that makes this work, plus the fact that both men really attempt to 'get into the skin' of their character, something mostly ignored in other examples of this genre.  Director Hill knows he's got a great team in front of the camera, and all that remains is for him to incorporate some spectacular action sequences around them.  This he does competently.  That one-two punch is what gives the movie its fireworks.   The banter and situations concerning the characters are also gleefully un-PC.  It'd be interesting to see what a studio and director would make of the same premise in these 'enlightened' times.  Murphy's comic stage persona is less restrained here than it would be in later films, and the results are often shamefully funny.   Don't expect Shakespeare, there's far too much cursing and other unsavoury shenanigans going on for that; do expect a pacy and entertaining early example of the 'buddy thriller'.

He's forced to enlist the help of fast-talking incarcerated con man Eddie Murphy, who has dealt with one of the killers in past. Murphy insists he be let out for 48 hours in order to secure a stash of money he has that the killer wants. Nolte and Murphy are a mismatched pair, Murphy being the sly young criminal, Nolte being a tough, somewhat ignorant cop who tires easily of his partner's fast mouth and wayward way of giving information, and constant attempts at getting a gun.There's one good scene where Murphy walks into a redneck cowboy joint with a bet about what it takes to be taken seriously as a cop, and trades places with Nolte as a detective trying to get information on where one of the guys is. Later on, Nolte and Murphy get into a fight because Murphy won't say what he knows the escaped killer is after.Walter Hill creates one of the best cop movies ever, and a perfect movie to act as Murphy's first real vehicle for his comedy style. However, this is not comedy like, say, Trading Places. This movie is more the comedy style of the first Lethal Weapon movie. Alternately serious and funny.

Considering one is a cop and the other is a convict it shouldn't really be considered a buddy cop movie. I watched this film a couple of days ago because it had been awhile since I watched it a thousand times on cable television as a kid. I was surprised at the amount of racial comments made in this film, I guess as a child I didn't really pay attention to those comments. The movie is still solid, definitely one of Walter Hill's best films. Eddie Murphy is perfecting his onscreen personality in his first film. Beverley Hills Cop wasn't far behind. Nick Nolte feels like a tired detective in this film. Nolte has always seemed like the perfect tired private eye or detective to me. The rough voice, the lined and aged face, he just seems right.

His movies are, generally-speaking, either very good or very bad. 48 Hours is one of his very good offerings. It gives Eddie Murphy one of cinema's most unforgettable movie debuts, and invents the conventions of the buddy cop genre that were to become blueprints for years to come. Every buddy picture after 1982 - including Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Fled, Bad Boys, and a thousand more - owes something to 48 Hours.The film opens with psychopathic Albert Ganz (James Remar) escaping from a chain gang. Determined to track down Ganz, tough cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) springs a fast-talking convict named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from jail for forty-eight hours, during which time the mismatched duo must find their quarry. Cates doesn't like blacks, and Hammond doesn't like cops, so before they can even get to the business of tracking down their man they first have to come to terms with working alongside each other.Fast-paced, energetic, foul-mouthed and funny, 48 Hours is simply a great ride. Nolte underplays brilliantly, wisely allowing Murphy to handle the loud and showy role while he etches a gruff, rugged characterisation as a cop on the warpath. The leading characters are rounded off wonderfully by James Remar, as a genuinely bad baddie. If the plot to 48 Hours sounds like a collection of all the clich√©s and predictabilities that ruin most films, it's important to remember that before this film nothing like it had really been done. These plot devices and conventions are only considered cliches nowadays because 48 Hours was so influential, not to mention frequently-imitated, in the ensuing years. James Horner's music score is perfectly judged too. Finally, no review of 48 Hours would be complete without some acknowledgment of the film's most famous scene. I'm talking - of course - about the bit where Murphy causes a stir in a redneck bar. More often than not famous movie scenes fail to live up to their lofty reputation, but in this case that simply isn't so. It really is an electrifying screen moment.... in a film that really is an electrifying screen experience!

High octane action directed sleekly by Walter Hill and the unexpurgated energetic glee Murphy exudes kicks the film into overdrive.

What made me enjoy the movie is the trust and respect that the Murphy and Nolte characters begin to show, even there are moments where they want to pound each other's head in. In addition to Nolte and Murphy (who's in his film debut), Remar is pretty good here despite having a limited amount of screen time. The photography of the city by Ric Waite is well, excellent and the skillful direction by Walter Hill can't go unnoticed. 48 Hrs. may not look as well-crafted as The French Connection, but Hill sure knows how to make something memorable out of nothing.

Nick Nolte plays Jack Cates, a rusty, cranky, tough-guy cop working the homicide department in San Francisco.  When a violent chain-gang escape reunites two hardened criminals (the greasy-looking Ganz and a towering Indian named Billy Bear) who subsequently murder two police officers and a prison guard, Cates is assigned to babysit paroled convict Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy), an old member of Ganz's gang.  Reggie has been released for one weekend (hence the title) to aid Jack in capturing these two cop-killers.  Unbeknownst to Cates, Ganz & Billy Bear are not simply out on a killing spree but rather in search of a very important briefcase that belongs to Reggie.I can't think of another film debut as explosive as Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs., even though Murphy's work on Saturday Night Live already tossed him into the public's consciousness.  It's also worth noting that because director Walter Hill is known for casting interracial leads in his non-western films (Brewster's Millions, Crossroads, Supernova), never before had we seen a black man act like this in a movie; assured, aggressive and confident to the point of being cocky.  It would be easy to dismiss Murphy's character as a black stereotype; well-dressed, horny, smooth-talking, bantering, but Murphy pulls his character away from stereotype cobwebs with unfiltered charisma and instinct.  Think of it, most people who now wail away the chorus to Roxanne are invoking Murphy instead of Sting (and what a hilarious introduction that is).  Also, there is the unforgettable sequence where Reggie takes over a redneck bar, posing as a cop!  It's the most magnetic scene in the film, and Murphy delivers (You know what I am?  I'm your worst f***in' nightmare!  That's right I'm a nigger with a badge and I got permission to kick your f***in' ass whenever I feel like it.)Obviously, this film wasn't written as a comedy.  Nolte spends much of his time hurling every kind of racial epithet imaginable at Murphy when he's not chain-smoking or guzzling from a flask.  Murphy injects his humor into the story without disrupting the movie's violently grim tone, and Murphy & Nolte are excellent at creating an oil-and-water duo that keeps them at odds for most of the film.  There are no stylistic explosions, but there are some tense gunfights including a chase scene in a train station and a shootout that employs a convertible and a public bus.  Composer James Horner, who would come to prominence in the 90's as one of the more reverent film composers, creates an unusual, percussion-driven score heavy with Caribbean flavor.  It's works well, adding an element of heat while Jack & Reggie cruise San Francisco with the top down.  The film has thankfully dated pretty well, and sometimes even holds the faint resemblance of a 1970's cop film (I'm sure interracial blaxploitation movies like Across 110th Street served their influence).  Of all of Walter Hill's work, Crossroads remains closest to my heart, but this is certainly his most mature effort.  Expect to laugh, but expect to be shaken too.

This formula proved to be so successful that it blazed the trail for the whole genre of buddy cop movies that followed. 48 Hours was also significant, however, for being Eddie Murphy's first film and the one that made him into an instant star.Detective Sergeant Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) is a tough San Francisco cop who's out for revenge after two of his colleagues are killed by escaped convicts Albert Ganz (James Remar) and Billy Bear (Sonny Landham) in a shootout at a local apartment building. Jack's investigations soon reveal that another member of their gang is still in prison serving a three-year sentence for robbery and so he arranges for Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) to be released on a 48 hour pass so that he can help to track down the two killers.Reggie proves to be useful in assisting Jack's pursuit of Ganz and Bear who'd killed a couple of guards when they broke out of prison and are now intent on finding the $500,000 that they stole before being sent to jail. Reggie discloses that the money was stashed away in the trunk of his car which had been parked in a garage for the 30 months that he'd been in prison. Predictably though, Jack and Reggie's mission to recover the money and bring Ganz and Bear to justice within the 48 hours available, proves to be both challenging and extremely dangerous.The relationship between Jack and Reggie is so highly-charged as it develops from open hostility to mutual respect (and eventually friendship) that it becomes absolutely fascinating to watch. It's also incredibly funny because they're so different and their interactions are so abrasive. The dialogue is sharp, witty and often coarse and when they trade insults (in pre-politically correct language) their brilliantly-written quick-fire exchanges are delivered with tremendous panache.Nick Nolte is excellent as the gruff, hard-drinking detective who chain-smokes, always looks dishevelled and has a totally dysfunctional relationship with his badly-treated girlfriend Elaine (Annette O'Toole). Eddie Murphy is sensational as Reggie, who's a fast-talking, wisecracking, smartly-dressed ladies man with a lot of attitude and reasons of his own for being prepared to help Jack. Murphy's first appearance in the movie is very memorable because of the excruciating way in which he sings Roxanne and the now-legendary scene in which he takes control of a redneck bar while posing as a police officer is still terrific and laugh-out-loud funny.In retrospect, it's clear that, as well as being a fantastically successful movie that's hugely entertaining, 48 Hours also proved to be far more influential than anyone could possibly have imagined at the time of its original release.

Nick Nolte was well on his way to super-stardom when he shared the screen with Saturday Night Live sensation Eddie Murphy in his feature film debut. Hard Times writer & director Walter Hill and scenarist Roger Spottiswoode deserve credit for conjuring up--with co-scribes Larry Gross of Streets of Fire and Steven E. de Souza of Die Hard--a tough-guy action thriller that was short of originality but long on the charisma that its two stars generated. Reportedly, producer Lawrence Gordon had an idea that barely resembled the outcome. In the Gordon premise, a criminal abducts the Louisiana governor's daughter, attaches an explosive device to her head, and demands ransom in 48 hours. The brutal cop assigned to the case recruits the kidnapper's prison cell mate to assist him on the investigation. Actually, they could have made the Gordon plot as a straight-to-video spin-off. After a hardened criminal, Albert Ganz (James Remar of The Warriors), escapes from a California chain-gang, Ganz with his crazy-as-a-loon Indian partner Billy Bear (Sonny Landham of Predator), they head for San Francisco to get the cash that their cohorts, Luther (Daniel Patrick Kelly of The Warriors) and Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) have secretly stashed in a convertible WV sports car in a garage. Rough-hewn Jack Cates (Nick Nolte of North Dallas Forty) decides to take a chance on a loud-mouthed convict who knows Ganz. Reggie has served almost three years on his sentence in San Quentin with six months left when Cates comes a-calling. Reggie convinces Cates to spring him and Cates forges a signature to get Reggie out of stir. The two have a hard time getting along initially but by the dust has settled, they are literally as thick-as-thieves. The shoot-outs are as thuggish as the characters squeezing the trigger as our heroes hunt down the hair-trigger villains. Neither Ganz nor Billy Bear show any qualms about blasting cops and taking hostages. Literally, there is never a dull moment. 48 HRS may not have been the first cops and robbers shoot'em up in the 80s to feature a foul-mouthed, screaming police superior--Frank McRae fits the bill to a tee--but it was probably near the top. Some say 48 HRS spawned the police buddy picture genre, but they are presumptious. The earliest buddy picture about cops was In the Heat of the Night (1967) with Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. 48 HRS might have inspired the pairings of other stars in an urban actioneer, and the Jack Cates character served as a prototype for Mel Gibson's suicidal Lethal Weapon hero Martin Riggs. You cannot help but wonder if Spottiswoode and Hill weren't inspired by Akira Kurosawa's 1949 crime thriller Stray Dog because Cates loses his .44 Smith & Wesson revolver early on during the action. Cates is trying to help Detective Algren (Jonathan Banks of Beverly Hills Cop) and Detective Vanzant (James Keane of Apocalypse Now) make an arrest at the Walden Hotel. Ganz surprises the cops when he slips out of his room by another door and comes up behind them in the hallway. A gunfight erupts. Vanzant takes a couple of slugs in the chest, and Ganz threatens to finish off Algren. Ganz grabs Cates' handgun just as Toshir√¥ Mifune lost his pistol in Stray Dog. Nolte and Murphy make a perfectly matched but mismatched heroic pair who spend most of their time in each other's faces. They develop a grudging respect for each other after a savage slugfest on the sidewalk. Miraculously, Reggie's Giorgio Armani suit isn't torn to shreds during their knock-down, drag-out brawl. These guys run into more trouble from the law as they close in on Ganz and Billy. At least twice they find themselves interfered with by men in blue. Eventually, they corner the villains in Chinatown and blast it out with them. The ending with Ganz holding Reggie at gunpoint as a human shield against the sullen Cates is straight out of Dirty Harry. The relentless action, the wisecracking--mostly improvised--dialogue, and memorable performances by Nolte and Murphy boost this routine thriller. Murphy's scene in a redneck bar as he masquerades as a cop makes this police movie worth watching. Indeed, Murphy garnered an Golden Globe nomination for his debut performance. Hill anted up a sequel Another 48 HRS about eight years later with Nolte and Murphy reprising their roles.

However, a lot of the characters are underwritten, most notably the villain who gets a worthy introduction but isn't seen too much until the inevitable climax. Nick Nolte's girlfriend is also underwritten and seems to serve little purpose other than to give him something else to bitch about. However, Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy's characters are very well-defined and developed, and their chemistry is what makes the movie so special. Eddie Murphy really hit it out of the park with this film, his feature debut. There's a lot of great action and comedic scenes, but my favorite has to be when Eddie Murphy takes on a bar full of rednecks. What transpires is truly hilarious, and an excellent character-building moment. Also, since the movie moves along so quickly, you never get bored watching what happens on screen. My last complaint would be that the film is resolved maybe a little too quickly, but it still was a satisfying ending, nonetheless. I should also mention that this movie has a killer soundtrack, with one particularly good song by The Busboys, (The Boys Are) Back In Town, which is a rollicking good blues rock tune.

What is wrong with you , people ? It's a classic ! The whole movie even after all those years has a sense of freshness in it . It is based on original idea about cop working with thief to catch bandits. Usually an action comedy is a buddy cop movie when two cops with different personalities try to work together solving a case (Lethal weapon , Red heat, , Tango and Cash and so on ) . The idea of making a cop work with thief is brilliant , because it allows us to watch the struggle between people from two different worlds (law and crime ) not two people from one world (law). It opens up new possibilities for fun and the movie uses the idea to the maximum.Nick Nolte (Jack Cates) and Eddie Murphy (Reggie Hammond) are brilliant together . They have great chemistry and each one of them shines in his role . Some people say that Murphy overshadows Nolte , but I don't agree . Yes , the 48 hours was the movie that started Eddie's career , but it was a team effort . After all , when you think of Nolte , you probably think of 48 hours first.It's Nolte's most recognizable role and one of his best performances . He's great as aggressive, cynical , burned out and brutal cop . Murphy also makes his character much more than a typical funny black guy who is a comic relief role , that often appears in action movies. His Reggie Hammond is a thief with strong sense of elegance , pride and weakness for pick pocketing. Together both are fun to watch as they argue and slowly become friends.James Remar (Ganz) , David Patrick Kelly (Luther) and Sonny Landhan (Billy Bear) all were very convincing as the dangerous criminals . Frank McRae was big fun as typical big black boss yelling at our heroes . I was in tears , when he was shouting at Cates and Hammond ! Brion James (Blade runner) has a supporting role as Kehoe &#x96; a friend cop of Cates . Annette O'Toole plays an instrumental role of Cates angry girlfriend Elaine. Too bad , the movie could use her more.Funny fact &#x96; Jonathan Banks plays here a small , but important role of good cop. He doesn't have a scene with Murphy , but he appears in Beverly Hills cop as a thug.The movie is a powerful mix of action and comedy . The two outstanding scenes are the bet between Hammond and Cates (There's a new sheriff in town) and the bus chase . Especially the first scene is wonderful , because it explains why Murphy was so awesome in the 80's.A really good script combined with top notch acting and a confident direction from Walter Hill make this movie a winner . It's more in style of Lethal weapon than Beverly Hills cop . Remember that . Also remember the great song from Bus Boys The boys are back in town. And don't forget to watch this classic movie . I give it 8/10.

He has just the right combination of in-your-face barbs with letting down his guard and showing his feelings.The action scenes are realistic, harrowing, never over the top, and they don't go on too long.The villains are effective and believable, if blanks as characters. James Remar has the role of a psychopath completely at his disposal.The story line is very clever, teaming a cop with a convict for 48 hours in order to catch a cop-killer that the convict knows.

And 48 Hours has a lot to do with that statement. I have seen this movie a million times and its kind of bittersweet, that Murphy ended up becoming one of the biggest movie stars ever while the very talented Nick Nolte was a criminally underrated actor for much of his career.This represented not only the movie debut of Murphy but also one of the finest hours of Nolte and head villain James Remar's (Albert Ganz) career. Remar is also an underrated actor who I have enjoyed in many shows and movies; but he was really a scumbag in this film beating on women, killing people for nothing, etc.This film was one of Walter Hill's better films and it was also a very, very well cast film. This movie ranks in my Top 5 of best Eddie Murphy films. For all of you who grew up in the 1980s be VERY thankful, because they don't make stuff anymore like they did back then.

But right from the off, this is one partnership that ain't gonna flow like a boat.At just 21, Murphy took his stand-up comedy act and took to the big screen with veteran Nolte for this raucious cop thriller. The movie also introduced the likes of notable character actor Remar as well as David Patrick 'Sully' Kelly in a supporting role.It has (for it's time, anyway) an interesting angle of a good guy and a bad guy coming together and what would happen if they came to depend on each other. Murphy's character indeed isn't awfully likable and an unfortunate stereotype for some black characters in cinema, but Nolte gives a good turn as the hard-assed, cranky cop. The movie has it's 'buddy-buddy' angle down to a tee, but it seems to be too indulgent of this and seems to forget that it was actually meant to be an action movie and concentrate on the action (of which there's hardly any!) making it become rather boring after a while.If you're looking for a good 'buddy-buddy' cop movie, you've come to the right place.

It's violent, foul mouthed, and there are laughs aplenty. It is hard to see these types of movies nowadays with the political correctness and Hollywood's main aim to attract wider audiences with toned down movies. Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (in his feature film debut) created a great chemistry as the hard nosed cop and fast talking criminal who are made reluctant partners to bring down a common enemy. Director Walter Hill has done a fine job and his midas touch with bringing gritty action movies to the big screen is sorely missed.The movie starts with Billy Bear (Sonny Landham, Predator) breaking Albert Ganz (James Remar, The Warriors) out of prison by staging a fight and killing three prison guards. Two days later, SFPD Inspector Jack Cates (Nick Nolte, Cape Fear) and two other detectives track down Albert Ganz and Billy Bear hiding out at the Walden Hotel in downtown San Francisco which ends in a bloodbath and two of the police detectives accompanying Cates are killed.Jack Cates is determined to bring down Albert Ganz and Billy Bear but must also enlist the help of a fast talking hustler Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy, Trading Places) to help track down Ganz and Billy who was also previously associated with the crazed criminals. Ganz and Billy are also killing off their previous associates and have kidnapped the girlfriend of another associate Luther (David Patrick Kelly, Commando) to find $500,000 that has been mysteriously stashed away in a hiding spot. Tracking down the crazed criminals won't be easy given that Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond have already developed an antagonistic relationship.In Eddie Murphy's feature film debut, he explodes onto the scene in a huge way, and his comedic talents have not been wasted for one moment. Nick Nolte as Jack Cates plays it perfectly as the straight man who doesn't always see eye to eye with Reggie Hammond and many others. James Remar and Sonny Landham make a great duo as the crazed criminals creating a rampaging path through San Francisco.Keep an eye out for many other character actors in small roles including but not limited to Jack's boss Captain Haden (Frank McRae, Lock Up), Jack's girlfriend Elaine (Annette O'Toole, Superman III), Inspector Algren (Jonathan Banks, Breaking Bad), and in other small roles Chris Mulkey (First Blood) as a patrol officer and Denise Crosby (Star Trek The Next Generation) as Sally, the woman who attacks Reggie with a baseball bat.The movie has non stop foul mouthed, politically incorrect humour which counterbalances the strong violence, but there is no denying that 48 Hrs. is well worth the time.

He elicits the help of a smooth talking, jailed convict who is connected to the killer, 'Reggie Hammond', who again is perfectly played by Eddie Murphy. Over the next 48 hours, the two polar opposites not only fight their way to the killer, but fight each other as well, making for some very memorable scenes.

It's a sharp, witty, and incredibly energetic action comedy, and remains one of the highlights of the under-rated director Walter Hills' career. It introduced a then very young comedy star named Eddie Murphy to the big screen in a big way. Over three decades later, it remains fun to watch.A rock solid Nick Nolte stars as weary, cranky detective Jack Cates, who's after a psychotic prison escapee named Albert Ganz (an intense James Remar). In order to get the goods on Ganz, Cates decides he will enlist the services of Reggie Hammond (Murphy), a slick, smooth young criminal who was once in the same gang as Ganz. Cates springs Hammond out of jail for the title period of time, and the sparks fly as the two strong personalities butt heads (almost literally) with each other.Murphy exudes tons of confidence, and lights up the screen in what is rightly regarded as the films' best scene, when he intimidates the regulars at a redneck bar. He and Nolte get some amazing chemistry as their banter flies back and forth. The relationship between them is believable at every turn. In fact, it's so antagonistic that, not surprisingly, Cates and Hammond come to blows. Director Hill keeps the movie racing forward; there's no filler here, just a good and meaty story with some effective scenes of violence and some nicely done chases. It's all set to a catchy James Horner score.Annette O'Toole is unfortunately rather wasted in an under developed role as Cates's fed-up girlfriend, Frank McRae is amusing as the kind of Yelling Boss we're all familiar with from countless action films, and Remar and Sonny Landham are very enjoyable villains. (Remars' Ganz is such a nut job that a hooker surmises that he enjoys shooting cops more than getting laid.) The supporting cast features many appearances by familiar faces and great character actors David Patrick Kelly, Brion James, Jonathan Banks, James Keane, Denise Crosby, Olivia Brown, Jim Haynie, Jack Thibeau, Peter Jason, Chris Mulkey, R.D. Call, Gloria Gifford, John Dennis Johnston, and Ola Ray.The 97 minute run time of this classic pretty much flies by. With a thoroughly memorable pair of characters at the forefront, it keeps the audience watching. Along with, say, Riggs and Murtaugh from the Lethal Weapon franchise, Cates and Hammond pretty much *define* the buddy movie. Viewers hoping for a tough, hard hitting action film with entertaining roles and a good sense of humour won't be disappointed with what they see here.10 out of 10.

Filled with great direction,excellent performances from Nick Nolte,Eddie Murphy and the rest of the cast and a wonderful score,48 Hrs is Hill,Notle and Murphy at their best.Set in San Francisco,California,48 Hrs tells the story of tough cop Jack Cates(Nick Notle)who wants to bust two cops killers escaped convict Albert Ganz(James Remar)and his associate Billy Bear(Sonny Landham). With nowhere to turn,Jack wants help from Reggie Hammond(Eddie Murphy,in his film debut),a smooth talking,wisecracking prisoner who used to run with Ganz and Billy Bear. With Jack getting Reggie out for 48 Hrs,Jack and Reggie must team up and try to get Ganz and Billy,that is if they don't kill each other first.48 Hrs is a great film and is the movie that started it all and also set the standard for Action-Comedies that came later on. This film did for Action-Comedy like 2001A Space Odyseey did for Science Fiction and Halloween did for the Horror/Slasher genre after all Where would all of the Lethal Weapon films,Beverly Hills Cop films,Rush Hour films and others be without 48 Hrs' influence. One of the reasons 48 Hrs is excellent is because the film is a combination of violent 1970s early 80s Action films with edgy Comedy. Unlike most of the Action/Comedies that came which were light in comparison,the Action and tone in 48 Hrs is gritty and sometimes dark and very violent which in my opinion separates 48 Hrs from the other Action/Comedies because the film has a great balance between seriousness and laughter. The film was in between and a transitional period from the gritty Dirty Harry type film of the 70s to the Lethal Weapon/Beverly Hills Cop type films of the 80s and beyond. The Comedy and humor in the film is great because it's sometimes played straight and to the point with memorable dialog and characters which are aggressive and very profane. What I also love about the Comedy and humor is how politically incorrect it is because where most Comedies now play it safe and hold back,48 Hrs' Comedy is edgy,risky and uncompromising. It's the kind of Comedy that would offend most people and studio heads and that's one of the things I love about the film. The now classic Bar scene is a prime example of politically incorrect Comedy. The two main characters Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond are one of cinemas greatest tag team duos and it is a classic pairing that can be seen as a great precursor to Riggs and Murtaugh in the Lethal Weapon series except in this film Jack is a Cop and Reggie is the criminal. Like in any entertaining Buddy Action-Comedy,Jack and Reggie at first really hate each other and the back and forth dialog between the two memorable characters is hilarious and truly unforgettable with Jack being tough and gritty and Reggie using his wisecracks and sarcasm and the banter and back and forth between the two doesn't feel forced or fake but real and natural and you as a viewer are fascinated with Jack and Reggie and their natural back forth dialog is what makes the film and the two main characters classic and memorable. While the two hate and dislike each other in the very beginning,Jack and Reggie start to like each other as the film goes on and the two begin to really start to understand their own motivations and reasons for wanting to catch the bad guys and the two main characters are well developed and likable. Co-Writer and Director Walter Hill is a master at dealing with tough male characters and male bonding and 48 Hrs is no exception. The Action and shootouts in the film are amazing,intense and fast-paced like a lot of Walter Hill's films. The Action in the film also gives the film a great balance between Action and Comedy. The ending of the film is Action-packed as well as funny with the characters Jack and Reggie and is a great conclusion.The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Nick Nolte is excellent as cop Jack Cates,with Nolte bringing toughness,grit and humor to the role. Eddie Murphy(in one of the great film debuts of all time)is brilliant and hilarious as Reggie Hammond,with Murphy bringing great Comedy to the performance and having great chemistry with Nolte. Annette O'Toole is good and beautiful as Elaine,Jack's girlfriend. Frank McRae is wonderful as Haden,Cates' boss. James Remar and Sonny Landham are great and intense as Albert Ganz and Billy Bear. Brion James does a good job as Ben Kehoe,one of Jack's fellow officers. David Patrick Kelly does a great job as Luther,an associate of Reggie and Ganz. Margot Rose(Casey),Denise Crosby(Sally),Kerry Sherman(Rosalie),Olivia Brown(Candy)and Jonathan Banks(Algren)give good performances as well.The direction by Walter Hill is excellent,with Hill bringing an intensity,energy and great atmosphere to the film and Hill also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction,Hill.The Score by James Horner is wonderful and intense and adds to the energy and greatness of the film. Great score. The film also includes the classic song The Boys Are Back in Town by The Bus Boys and Brian O'Neal.In Final Word,if you love Action films,Comedy films,Walter Hill,Nick Nolte,Eddie Murphy or films in general,I highly suggest you see 48 Hrs,a excellent,landmark classic that you can watch again and again.

Eddie Murphy gave best performance as Reggie a fast-talking smooth criminal, Murphy steals most of his scenes, almost as good as he was in Beverly HIlls Cop (that was his absolute best). This movie had some decent action for 1982 times, but not great, and the suspense was a bit odd, but decent.

But what also makes this film so excellent is its atmospheric music, especially the hard-driving opening theme and its steel drum-flavored variations - particularly when Our Heroes follow Luther to the subway station (whence the traffic goof is revealed) - yet unlike the tiresome sequel, there ain't no soundtrack to this! Like Harold Faltermeyer's incidental music in Beverly Hills Cop what wasn't included on that movie's soundtrack, I feel cheated of Good Listening independent of the action here - and I loved Brand New Shoes or whatever that first performed song was called instead of that overrated yawner The Boys Are Back In Town. The artistes released a *cover* CD which really doesn't cover it. I just now found out about a Horner bootleg from 7 years ago!!! that has both the title track and the Following Luther theme, although in one case a reviewer found its sound quality to be less than perfect.

Walter Hill's style set up a structure a lot of films would borrow from for a long time.  It's also was the first time the buddy system was applied in such a way.  It had been seen before, but not with characters like this.  Not with the same banter and chemistry by Nolte and Murphy.  They are a great team, which is something a lot of recent buddie cop films have been missing.  Their performances together was the foundation for a lot of other buddie cop films, including anothe black & white pair, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon.  The movie provides some good action scenes, but at the time they could only do so much.  It's better viewed with the frame of mind that this has a comedy foreground and action background.  There are some weak spots, like with any action film.  Some scenes drag a bit.  The thing with Nolte's girlfriend is underdeveloped and thus it's inclusion in the film at all is a waste of time.  And the film lacks a great villain.  Hey, I love James Remar as much as the next guy, but the entire second act goes without an appearnce by the main baddie.  Overall, it has flaws.

I saw this movie so many years ago, and really, I'm sure I never saw the whole film because no way my parents would have allowed it.

The closest thing I've seen to it is Rush Hour, and even as much as Chris Tucker pushed the envelope with the subtle digs at Jackie Chan's Chinese heritage, you definitely saw that a line was drawn. In 48 Hours, no line was set--which is maybe why it was such a hit.Eddie Murphy was funny, though not nearly as funny as in other movies. Nick Nolte was all too good as the raspy voiced, surly cop.

(1982) is an action classic the only original best buddy cop flick from the 80's. Is an action cop flick that I love to death and it was honestly the first action film I saw as a kid. I grew up watching this film and in my opinion is still my favorite action buddy flick. This is first time we see Eddie Murphy in action before he went in making Beverly Hills Cop (1984), beside Beverly Hills Cop this is one if his best movies of the 80's. It is actually my favorite Walter Hill film. Like I said I grew up watching this film, I loved 48 Hrs. so much that I hardly convinced my mom to watch this movie with me and the sequel of this film. I read on Charles Bronson's Murphy's Law (1986) flick that the storyline of that film the pairing a cop with a convict was popular in Hollywood during the 1980s after the success of this film 48 Hrs. (1982). Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are sensational in this film, the action is great and the plot about this film is well paced it goes fast and it is entertaining. I really enjoy watching this movie and honestly I love it more, than I would love the sequel, the sequel can't even hold a candle to this film.Yeah. Well, I'm real impressed with you too, man. It takes a real-skilled cop to kick in the bedroom door of a couple of dykes!Plot A hard-nosed cop reluctantly teams up with a wise-cracking criminal temporarily paroled to him, in order to track down a killer.The film is actually about a $500,000 stashed cash and two cop killers who are running around and killing cop,s while they want to get the hands of this cash. A tough cop who is a survivor in a shoot out in the hotel from those two killers, pairs with a convict from prison to help him to get and catch those two killers. They only have 48 Hrs. before the cop has to bring the convict back. They don't make films like this anymore, I really love action films from the 80's and this one was the first one I have saw as a kid. My favorite part in the film is the stake out scene Jack (Nick Nolte) and Reggie (Eddie Murphy) head out to the parking garage, and they park across the street from the parking garage, waiting till the parking garage opens which it does around 7.00 am in the mornings and they spend the night there. Next morning Jack (Nick Nolte) brings a caf√© drink to Reggie (Eddie Murphy) and wakes him up. The similar thing happened to me when I was 12 years old. My mom drove me and my dad with the car in the city 4.00 am in the mornings it was night than and my dad went with his bike delivering news paper, me with my mom waited on him in the car till his shift ends. During the waiting I fall a sleep, when I woke it was past 7.00 am and my mom brought me food from the store in the car. That moment I remember this scene in this film. It is a beautiful child memories of mine on my mom and 48 Hrs. (1982) is my childhood movie and it is memories on my childhood. 48 Hrs. and Beverly Hills Cop 1 & 2 are my favorite Eddie Murphy films from my childhood that I love to death.This is Nick Nolte's best action flick that I love to death and only one that is worth to watch. I love Music theme by James Horner that I love so much including the opening scene that was awesome. Honestly James Horner made the same music theme for Commando (1985) Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie. I love the shout outs, the action scenes, the dialogues and I also love the main lead roles from Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond are my favorite characters. This is the only original action film, but I think it was unnecessary making a sequel (Another 48 Hrs.) that I honestly think Nick Nolte made a lousy awful job reprising his role and Eddie Murphy was even worst by shouting and punching Nick Nolte. Before I finish my review you have a few cast that are memorable here You have James Remar from Dexter playing the main villain, David Patrick Kelly from Commando and The Warriors, Sonny Landham from Predator, Annette O'Toole from Smallville, Jonathan Banks from Beverly Hills Cop and Olivia Brown from Miami Vice. I have this film on Blu-ray I used to own the DVD but I switch it for Blu-ray.Overall Is my favorite action flick from my childhood and I love it to death. This flick get's a solid 10 by me and it deserves it.48 Hrs. is a 1982 American action comedy film directed by Walter Hill, starring Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (in his film debut and Golden Globe Award-nominated role) as a cop and convict, respectively, who team up to catch a cop-killer.

Accept no substitutes.","Date":"8 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Walter Hill's bawdy buddy cop classic 48 Hrs is for me the original and best entry in the sub genre. Countless films since have attempted to re create the aesthetic which was so purely and profanely distilled here. I think one of the reasons it worked so well is because one of the duo isn't even a cop at all, but a fast talking ex con played by Eddie Murphy with exquisite comic timing and bullet-time verbosity in what was one of his first roles. He's paired with a gruff, grunting Nick Nolte as Jack Cates, a spectacularly bad tempered Detective who is forced to bring along Murphy's gabber mouthed Reggie Hammond on a mad goose chase of a hunt for two staggeringly homicidal criminals. The entirety of the film is peppered with nostalgically anti-PC banter between the two, delightfully distasteful stuff that would never make it into a studio movie in this, the day and age of the offended millennial whiner. These two guys genuinely dislike each other for the majority of the film, and get so caught up in their petty feuds and arguing that they actually get distracted from their case, taking interludes to literally beat each other up in an alley. Nolte is perfect as the irresponsible hotshot with anger issues up the wazoo and a penchant for reckless behaviour. Murphy doesn't let up with the mile-a-minute yakking for one second of screen time, making damn sure his performance makes an impression. And it did, putting him on the map in a big way, and forging a career playing these types of dudes. James Remar has never been scarier, crafting a villain so psychopathic and dangerous he'd rather shoot cops and terrorize civilians that enjoy a hooker he picks up. The look of pure malice on his face as he coldly puts a bullet in a poor officer is chilling. He's Albert Ganz, heinous prison escapee on the run with equally nasty compadre Billy Bear (The legendary Sonny Landham). The two prove to be a raging juggernaut of violence for Jack and Reggie to contend with, providing some crackling action set pieces including a chase scene set on a speeding San Francisco cable car that will give your TV a good workout. There's supporting work from solid players including some Hill favourites. David Patrick Kelly plays an unsavoury associate of Ganz's, Annette O Toole is Jack's poor neglected love interest, and there's work from Chris Mulkey, Jonathan Banks, Frank McCrae and the late Brion James as well. When it comes to buddy cop flicks, this is the original and accept no substitutes. The two leads have never been funnier or more committed to such a heightened pair of performances. Hill drives the direction with snappy, ruthless precision where the laughs hit with the same stinging impact as the full throttle violence and wanton obscenities hurled across the screen. It holds up just as well today as it did back in the 80's, and is always ripe for a revisit.

Both characters are tolerable at best, racist and homophobic at worst, so it was difficult for me to care what happened to them. Also, the plot (with a screenplay begun by Roger Spottiswood, then fleshed out by Steven DeSouza, then adapted further during filming by Walter Hill & Larry Gross) almost completely falls apart if one thinks about it afterward. Some abrupt tone changes several times in the final scenes may be a result of the rewrites, and they don't help.I could now only recommend this for Eddie Murphy fans and/ or Nick Nolte fans (who have probably already seen it), or someone with an interest in San Francisco.

The convicts go to San Francisco and grab an old acquaintance, slimy Luther (David Patrick Kelly) and his girl. They want the money that he is supposedly holding, and as insurance hold the sleaze-ball's girlfriend hostage until the cash is delivered. The convicts hole up in a shady hotel and order prostitutes. Meanwhile our hero &#x96; cranky, gruff, and tough detective &#x96; Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) and two plainclothesmen surge into the hotel room. Nonetheless the situation goes badly for the lawmen as the two cops are killed and the hoodlums escape. At the police station, Cates is given grief by his immediate superior Haden (Frank McRae) who rants and raves (and overreacts in all of his scenes). One of the prostitutes, lovely Lisa (Greta Blackburn) &#x96; who earlier had exposed her beautiful breasts &#x96; says to a policewoman, I think he's going to give you guys a hard time. When asked why, she quips, I just think he likes shooting cops a lot more than getting laid.Determined to track down the two thugs, Cates is forced to turn to convicted thief and hustler Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) for help. Rather easily, he gets Hammond a two-day parole from jail (in his custody) to assist him. Hammond is also after Ganz. Seems these two stole money from a drug dealer several years earlier, and Ganz is determined to grab the whole stash. So the rest of the movie focuses on two mismatched guys &#x96; Cates and Hammond &#x96; who hate each other. Cates likes to utter racial epithets; Hammond hates cops. Hammond puts it plainly, We ain't brothers, we ain't partners, and we ain't friends. Over two days though, the two men gradually develop a mutual respect for each other as they traverse various places around town in a convertible Cadillac looking for information that leads to the two fugitives. Near the end there is a thrilling chase and shootout involving a public bus and convertible. The main gripe along the way is this scenario The fight between the two protagonists in the alley is long and Murphy comes out of it looking a little too good. His suit is hardly ruffled. The much larger Nolte looks worse. Nevertheless, Nolte and Murphy are sensational as a team, as there is great chemistry between them. By the way, this movie is Murphy's debut. On the other side, Remar and Landham play sufficiently psychotic and violent goons. The movie's non-stop sharp dialog and the music of the Busboys are pluses.

But cop and con couldn't get along worse, making the allotted 48 hours a grueling test for both of them. On its own, this is a pretty god cop movie. But it's the great chemistry between Nolte and Murphy that fuels 48 Hrs. The animosity between the two feels completely genuine, even though it's played for comedic effect. This is a gleefully non-politically correct movie, and the bristling undercurrent of ill-will charges the dialog between the two (even a few racial slurs, here and there). The tension ends up exploding in a fairly brutal fistfight between the two. Both men sell it, right down the line. But it's Murphy (making his auspicious film debut) that makes this film memorable.

I'm a n****r with a badge. That means I have permission to kick your ass whenever I feel like it! &#x96; Eddie Murphy (48 Hours).Walter Hill's 48 Hours is primarily interesting for two reasons. Firstly, the film is explicitly about race. Released the same year as Michael Jackson's record breaking Thriller album, the film marks the point at which black artists began to be embraced by the conservative white mainstream. The days of black actors like Sidney Poitier or Bill Cosby strutting about like well spoken white men in black-face, or blaxploitation heroes like Shaft, Super Fly and Foxy Brown asserting their rage on underground cinema screens, was now long gone. Here we had Eddie Murphy as Reggie Hamond, less a fast talking convict than an angry authority throwing America's racism back in their face...and enjoying every minute of it.In one iconic scene, Murphy enters a bar of rednecks and cowboys and lays down the law. Having endured the jabs of a bigoted and racist partner for the first 30 minutes of the film (Nick Nolte), Murphy relishes the chance to line up, fight and verbally abuse a horde of racist white guys. It's like hundreds of years of racial oppression coming back and biting the white man in the ass.And so it is here that Murphy developed the on screen personality of a clever, fast-talking and self-confident urban black man. The very same personality he would spend the first half of his career milking (Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places etc). Ironically, later in his career Murphy would express his distaste for being pigeonholed in such a fashion. Rather than a victory for African Americans, the fast talking urban Blackman has become just another Hollywood stereotype. Think Chris Tucker's sideshow performance in Rush Hour or Martin Lawrence in the Bad Boys movies (forever proving the whiteness of Will Smith), Hollywood rarely treating black characters with any sort of nuance, depth or reality.The other interesting thing about 48 Hours is the way it virtually invented the buddy cop action comedy genre. Three decades worth of buddy movies owe their templates to this flick. That template being this the main hero is a rogue, irreverent and macho cop who never goes by the book but whose success in taking out bad guys saves him from the wrath of his superiors, mostly embodied by a perpetually angry, loudmouth police captain. After a foot chase, car chase or gunfight at the start of the film, our hero sees his partner/colleague/friend/dog killed by the main bad guy, resulting in his job becoming personal. His one-man-show investigation is then strengthened by the presence of another cop/friend/helper, who must win his trust in a series of embarrassing/comical buddy buddy incidents. Their mutual quest almost always comes to a dead end, before they get their act together and manage to take out the bad guys in a final showdown. Throw in marital/woman problems, convertibles, car chases and you have a formula which has been overused to the point of annoyance.7/10 &#x96; Aside from a couple scenes in which we're riveted by Eddie Murphy's motor mouth, this film hasn't aged well, countless rip-offs lessening any impact it may have once had. On the plus side, director Walter Hill shoots violence with a brutality which most films lack. He would release a terrible sequel, Another 48 Hours, several years later.Worth one viewing.

While I admit to liking the Lethal Weapon series better, Nolte and Murphy are great together, both delivering strong, edgy performances.Though it's a formula film, the two actors and the good direction lift 48 Hours out of the formula to provide great characterizations and a high level of entertainment.

However today, after 1000s of buddy movies, '48 Hours' feels dated. The story has been tried and tested numerous times thereafter. It doesn't have much to offer today and the execution isn't anything outstanding either but this is among the 'pioneer' buddy films. However the dialogues are proof of some fine writing. The highlight of '48 Hours' is obviously Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy who are terrific together. It is their scenes, whether action or comedy, that you leave with. Murphy already shows signs of a gifted comedian but he also seems to draw a comedic side from a more experienced actor like Nick Nolte (who is also excellent as the tough cop). Thanks to them '48 Hours' features a hilarious sequence at a rednecks bar and this is one of the funniest moments on film. Even though '48 Hours' may look outdated, it is worth the watch alone for Murphy and Nolte. I still give it a thumbs up over wannabes like 'Rush Hour'.

That's exactly what it is.  The only difference here is that this film was the very first of its kind.  Its unique style has been copied over and over again, but no film nor series has ever done a better job.  Series such as Miami Vice and films such as Rising sun, Rush hour, Beverly Hills cop or Lethal weapon all contain the same obvious elements that this film came up with back in 1982.The most satisfying thing about 48 hrs. is without a doubt the chemistry between Nick Nolte and Eddy Murphy.  Nick Nolte is flawless as the rusty, tough-guy who's constantly smoking cigarettes in order to forget that he has a drinking problem.  Eddy Murphy, on the other hand, is a hyper, non-stop babbling, know-it-all convict and as expected from someone like Eddy Murphy before we even get a first glimpse of him, we already hear his voice loud and clear from a great distance.  Eventually, it would be this very character that he would get to play several times over and over again.  In Trading places, Beverly Hills cop, Metro and even as Buddy Love in The nutty professor or as the voice of Donkey in Shrek; all these characters share the same obvious characteristics.  Come to think of it Eddy Murphy is one of the very first Afro-American comedians; that is ... after Richard Pryor of course.Although the acting performances of both Nick Nolte and Eddy Murphy are top-notch, not everything about 48 hrs. is that good.  It's a pity that the film only has two interesting characters overshadowing the rest of the cast.  And that goes for the acting as well.  The storyline is pretty lame, but it's backed up by the great action scenes.  And the dialogues CAN be funny if you don't mind the bad language that lasts throughout the entire picture.All in all, this is an important action movie that has become a classic in its own right.

Nick Nolte stars as a cop with a drinking problem, while driving a beat-up 1964 Cadillac ragtop.

Even the Ice-T/Suzy Amis flick Judgment Day followed a similar chemistry, but the later films that featured small referential scenes (e.g. handcuffed to a steering wheel, a bar brawl, or a macho showdown scene) are attributed to this timeless classic.

Murphy is Reggie Hammond a two-bit hustler who has stolen $500,000 but is now serving time. His accomplice Ganz has escaped from the Chain gang and Nolte is searching for him.  Ultimately the film stands or falls on success of Nolte's quite incredibly sustained brevity and gruffness and Murphy's wise-cracking and bright persona.  In this respect it succeeds dramatically and the two visibly yield to each other without ever being sentimental and there is always a drug dealer to catch to interrupt any gentle moments.

Along the way he enlists the aid of a convict Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) who just happens to be one of the pairs ex-partners, after arranging his temporary 48 hour release.Director Walter Hill whose obvious specialty is action films spins a fairly simple but still compelling story. There is a lot of action in the film and the language is very raw.The success of the film is often pinned on the effective pairing of Nolte and Murphy who both give strong performances as mismatched partners of necessity. This film is often cited as the beginning of the 1980's buddy cop genre which would spawn so many other films.In one of the most archetypal roles of this genre we have Bernie Casey playing the archetypal angry Police Captain, and he's quite good.Composer James Horner contributes a very effective and driving score for an action picture that grabs you from the opening scene You can easily forget how hot a prospect Eddie Murphy was early in his film career before either bad choices or other factors led to his extended career slump. Although he would recover from that slump his choices still seem erratic.On the downside though this film was made 25 years ago it seems today to be at best very male oriented and probably at least somewhat misogynistic. This may be a result of the time in which it was made and certainly reflects much of Director Hill's filmography. But as a result some may find this aspect difficult to ignore. Also reflective of Hill's repertoire is the fairly brutal violence, although this is far from the worst case for either its brutality or its presentation.48 Hours would be followed 8 years later by the oh so imaginatively title sequel Another 48 Hours. This film would re-team both Nolte and Murphy with Director Hill but would be neither as effective nor as successful.

Nick Nolte was actually the headliner for 48 Hrs with well over a decade of TV and films under his belt. Both are still acting, though Nolte has readily embraced his role playing status while Murphy has sullied his legend by steadfastly refusing to fade away, leading to a series of increasingly regrettable films with diminishing quality and box-office.I've said before there is a generation of kids who think Murphy is the voice of a donkey, who has parlayed Shrek into branching out into crap like Norbit, Meet Dave and Kid's stuff.The strength of 48 Hrs &#x96; make that both films &#x96; is that this is truly a mismatched duo. Nolte plays Jack Cates as a gruff, clumsy, violent man always with a smoke in one hand and a drink never far from the other.Cates is also not afraid to use physical and verbal bullying to get his way. He skirts the rules, ignores the reports and apparently is hellbent to get his man.Murphy on the other hand is Reggie Hammond, his mouth gets him into and out of trouble, he is slick, quick witted and resourceful and never short of an opinion.Cates is a cop on the hunt for a pair of convicts named Albert Ganz and a towering Native American named Billy Bear. The duo created a pile of bodies during their escape and are high priority targets. Cates logically thinks that it might help to quiz one of their still imprisoned ex-partners to plot where they might lie low&#x85; Reggie Hammond is that ex-partner, and he reluctantly agrees only on the proviso that he might be released temporarily so he can use his street contacts and nous to locate Ganz and Billy. It turns out that Reggie also has reason for wanting the pair back in jail.There is genuine animosity between Cates and Hammond, as mentioned above Cates will do anything to keep Hammond in line, continually referring to him as 'convict' and worse&#x85; in the 2000s this is rightfully abhorred but I guess even as recently as the early 1980s casual racism was still quite commonplace.Still with the friction well established the two move about San Fransisco trying to track down the violent escapees, with Reggie's rants and complaints getting constantly getting on Jack's nerves, often leading to predictable bouts of casual violence. (Somehow racism has become taboo but smacking guys around will always be funny.) There are more highlights than will usually be found in a 1980s movie &#x96; they mostly go 'Big intro&#x85; nothing much for 40 minutes&#x85; chase scene&#x85; nothing for 20 minutes&#x85; finale&#x85; credits' &#x96; but the crowing glory might well be when Reggie rousts a redneck titty bar in a search for information and&#x85; um&#x85; temporary female companionship.The finale is essentially a 40 minute chase scene through the backstreets of San Fransisco towards a predictable yet satisfying conclusion.The soundtrack is solid and the kettle drum theme quite memorable decades later, and Walter Hill movies always have some of the more satisfying loud and crisp gunshot sound effects, and the recipients of said bullets always seem to manage to defy gravity to fly dozens of feet backwards some feet from the ground, often through windows.48 Hrs is efficiency and entertainment through simplicity, the action is noticeable for its realism and lack of unnecessary flair, the numerous jokes come in the flow of the film and not at the expense of the story, and the very fact that Hammond and Cates are so different as individuals provides for consistent tension, often providing more violence and trash talking.Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 / 10. 48 Hrs might not spring to mind when thinking about the 'classics of the 80s', but it is worth noting that this was one of the pioneering mis-matched buddy action flicks, and it is worth a look even 3 decades on &#x96; especially when compared with the stuff Murphy has released in the last decade.

It is not going to be easy, not just because of Ganz and Billy, but Jack and Reggie are not getting along with each other, the tension at one point starting beating each other up. Reggie remembers $500,000 stashed away in the trunk of his car, which has been parked ever since he was convicted (something like three years).

Then there's the editing team of Freeman Davies, Mark Warner and Billy Weber who maintain the pic's fast tempo without a problem.Of course the obvious reason for this movie's success is the matching up of newcomer Eddie Murphy with rough, tough Nick Nolte. The pair exchange no beg pardons as they attempt to join forces (cop and con) in order to apprehend two desperate crims who have shot prison guards and police officers in trying to avoid capture.

Nick Nolte's Slob Cop dates back to Columbo and Eddie Murphy's shtick is the same as every other movie he's been in. Nolte's boss is the standard irritable hard-nose police captain from central casting and his girlfriend is the standard annoyed, mistreated, but ultimately devoted cop girlfriend we've seen a hundred times.The duo's pursuit of the bad guys is about as dull as a butterfly hunting expedition.

Heck, it was just getting started.In my own opinion Murphy is one of the funniest men to ever grace the screen -- when he's trying, but lately he just hasn't been.

The sad thing is, he's making a sequel to the former of the two films, and most lilkely we'll be seeing a Haunted Mansion 2 sometime in the future as well.During the '80s Murphy was world-famous for his wild and raw antics on-screen and during stand-up routines -- he had a foul mouth, and his constant crude behavior was something Americans had never really seen before, at least not quite so publicly. In 48 HRS. we witness a very young Murphy, constantly swearing, causing trouble for his co-partner. He's a convict released from jail for 48 hours to track down a criminal, but the plot does matter as much as the situations that result because of it.Detective Jack Cates (Nolte) is a cop on the trail of a murderer who killed some of his fellow partners in San Francisco.

As soon as Cates sees Hammond, he knows he's in for trouble.Reggie reluctantly agrees to cooperate and points out the killer, Ganz (James Remar), a former gang member. In addition to being the source of information, Reggie wants to join Cates' hunt for Ganz. Cates managers for a 48-hour parole pass for Reggie.Ah, the fun begins. The film has not stood the test of time as greatly as you might predict, although it has its fair share of humorous moments. Unfortunately the heavy '80s style of the movie becomes grating after a while -- I enjoy '80s films very much but 48 HRS. is often too specifically targeted at '80s pop culture for it to contain the same relevance today. It doesn't hold up as well as the far superior Lethal Weapon.However, for any fan of '80s flicks, Murphy (who upstages Nolte), or the genre itself, will find a fair amount of interest in this amiable cop-buddy picture.

(1982) is a crime thriller starring Nick Nolte as a tough guy/alcoholic cop in San Francisco who survives a fracas where two officers are killed. To apprehend the culprits (James Remar & Sonny Landham) he enlists the services of a convict (Eddie Murphy) for 48 hours. Annette O'Toole plays the cop's barely-seen babe and is therefore neglected.The film was directed by Walter Hill, the director and co-writer of 1979's The Warriors, and so it has some of the flair of that movie, as well as two of its main actors (Remar and David Patrick Kelly). It's easy to confuse it with Beverly Hills Cop, which came out two years later, since they're both cop thrillers starring Eddie Murphy, but Beverly Hills Cop is the superior film IMHO. Of course, it depends on what you're in the mood for. 48 HRS is more serious, brutal and edgy while BHC is lighter and more likable. The latter could be described as part comedy (although mostly serious) whereas the former is rough and nigh profane with amusing touches. BHC is just more palatable and has better themes in my opinion. The streetwise edginess of 48 HRS is too over-the-top comic booky and it's a turn-off. Nonetheless, it's a quality cop thriller and the character ark of the main characters is good, albeit predictable.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California.GRADE B- "}{"Title":"I always liked country boys....","Date":"16 February 2015","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Police officer Jack Cates is the only survivor of a cop shooting and to help hunt down the killers collects Reggie Hammond from jail for 48 hours.

Nolte supplies the cop stuff, Murphy's on board for the comedy, and the bad guys (James Remar and Sonny Landham) are truly fearsome. There's not an overload of action, but the violent scenes that punctuate the dialogue are near-knuckle and hard-hitting, with Hill refusing to shy away from the depiction of on-screen violence.I can't say I'm really a fan of Nick Nolte - as an actor, he seems to take taciturn to the next level, and he's a grumpy bugger here. Murphy is much better, brimming with vitality in the days before he became smug and over-indulgent. Remar and Landham are excellent as the criminals; a couple of guys you definitely wouldn't want to get stuck in a lift with.48 HRS. is no masterpiece; in addition, there have been so, so many similar films made in the years since that its appeal has been diluted somewhat.

The script by Hill, Steven E. de Souza, Roger Spottiswoode & Larry Gross lays down the basic rules all of it's many imitators would bide by, two mismatched guy's are thrown together by some crime they are both involved with & after lots of abuse they develop a mutual respect for each by the end, oh & one or both have to save the other's life at some point. It's a formula that's been done to death over the years & just because 48 Hrs. was the first doesn't automatically make it any good, to be fair to it it is good but not great. For a start there's not much action in it, a few dull shoot-outs, a short car chase & a couple of fistfights is about the sum total of it. Also one has to say the language is somewhat ripe with all sorts of profanity spoken, I just find constant streams of foul language to be a lazy way to write & it also gets old very quickly. It's a touch slow going in places & the story itself about stolen money isn't anything to excited about either, like I said good but not great.Director Hill does OK but there is one plot hole I can't figure out, so Ganz & Billy Bear kidnap Luther's girlfriend & tell him to get the money right? Well why didn't they kidnap Luther himself, keep him at gunpoint & just go with him to collect the money on Monday morning & then split? I mean shoot-outs in trains stations & stealing buses is not the way to keep a low profile especially since every cop in the city is looking for you. That just sounds a much better plan to me. Anyway there are some amusing foul mouthed one-liners here & the scene where Murphy intimidates a bar full of racist rednecks is hilarious but overall it's a bit light on action as far as I'm concerned.Technically the film is good with decent production values, set in San Francisco it was actually shot in Los Angeles. This was Eddie Murphy's first film, although it nearly wasn't as Gregory Hines was the first choice to play Reggie while Richard Pryor & Denzel Washington were also considered. Mickey Rourke was offered the role of Jack Cates but turned it down although Nolte does a good job regardless.48 Hrs. is a decent buddy buddy cop thriller that's a little short on action for my liking, it's still watchable with some funny profanity but it's not something I'd want to watch again anytime soon. I would say 48 Hrs. is so well remembered simply because it was the first rather than being the best. Followed by a sequel Another 48 Hrs. (1990) & literally 100's of imitators.

A much more common format is to have two individuals who are radically different in character, and whose relationship is based upon mutual suspicion, even mutual dislike, which gradually changes, if not to friendship, at least to mutual respect.48 Hours is a film of this kind. Albert Ganz, a violent criminal, is sprung from jail by an associate. Jack Cates is the police officer charged with tracking him down, and in order to do so he needs the assistance of another of Ganz's associates, Reggie Hammond. Unfortunately, Hammond is himself currently serving a jail term for theft, but Cates manages to get him released on parole for forty-eight hours. (Hence the title).This is sometimes regarded as the film which created the buddy genre and led to several similar films in the eighties and nineties, especially the Lethal Weapon series. It is not, however, as original as some of its defenders claim. The buddy movie was only a variation on the tough cop genre made popular in the late sixties and seventies by the likes of Bullitt and Dirty Harry (both of which, like 48 Hours, are set in San Francisco). The idea of teaming together police officers with different characters was not exactly new, either in the cinema or on television. Take for instance Cagney and Lacey, and even Dirty Harry was sometimes paired with partners who were more liberal and less gung-ho than himself. Neither was the idea of a policeman relying on one crook to catch another a new one.Even if 48 Hours is regarded as the first of the buddy cop movies, it is not a particularly good one. Its most original feature, and in my view the best thing about it, is Eddie Murphy's street-smart, wisecracking Hammond- I liked the scene set in the redneck bar, although I did find myself wondering exactly how typical such establishments are of liberal San Francisco. Nick Nolte's Cates, however, although cast in the same hard-line, ruthless mould as Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan or Steve McQueen's Frank Bullitt, lacked their charisma, and the film lacked the depth of the better tough cop films, especially Dirty Harry itself, which raised some surprisingly complex issues about the nature of justice and the philosophy of law enforcement.Walter Hill prefers to ignore issues of this type and the moral lines in 48 Hours are clear-cut. Ganz and his associates are clearly defined as the bad guys, and Cates and Hammond as the good guys, which gives them a licence to shoot first and ask questions later. It also appears to give them a licence to swear like troopers; even today the film would be remarkable for its excessive use of bad language, and the interminable stream of cuss-words must have seemed even more shocking in the early eighties. The film-makers' intention was obviously to make a fast-moving, hard-hitting action thriller, but 48 Hours is a rather weak example of the genre, an ultra-violent cop movie with all the moral complexity of a playground game of cops and robbers.

I don't mind Murphy that much because his fast-talking style amuses me, but in general I am not much of a fan. Having read a couple of write ups it is interesting to learn that this was his first movie and the scene that made this movie was the one in which he walks into a Redneck bar, pretends to be a cop, and has everybody under his control. This is classic Murphy fast talk, but when you have seen movies like Beverly Hills' Cop, then this scene doesn't mean much. When put into the context of his first movie then it shows us a star in the making. The movie stars Eddy Murphy and Nick Nolte but Eddie Murphy dominates the movie with his cool black man jive and his easy going attitude. Nolte slips out of favour quite often with his bad attitude. Nolte plays a lone cop who just seems to hate people. He refuses to work with people and when a dangerous criminal escapes from gaol, he takes it on alone. In reality there would be a city wide manhunt and every cop would be out looking for him, but hey, why let reality get in the way of a good cop movie. The director of this movie, Walter Hill, creates an interesting atmosphere. The film is set in San Fransisco which means that it is perpetually cold and wet. Most of the action of the movie takes place at night, the only real action scenes that happens during the day is a gun fight in a San Fransisco subway station and the initial escape. The dank and dirty nature of all of the locations also gives a feeling of the street. The fugitive is little more than a street criminal who is in gaol for armed robbery. When he escapes he has not real place to go and spends his time in cheap hotels. Reggie Hammond is of this crowd but he tries to lift himself out of it by putting on an expensive suit. He tries to look impressive but really just fits in with the dirty atmosphere. I wouldn't rate this movie as one of the greats. Eddie Murphy is cool but the movie is slow and the action scenes are not gripping. The fight scene between Murphy and Nolte drags on and in the end one tends to be glad that it is finished. Die hard Murphy fans might disagree but truth is that this is my opinion.

The only real upshot of a repeated viewing of this film, decades later, is to see Eddie Murphy in his first film as a criminal who is let out before becoming a cop for the narratives duration.I can see how Murphy went on to bigger and better things by watching this film. Whilst not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination, Murphy plays his character named Reggie Hammond to such a degree that by the end when it seems like he has to go back to prison, we have empathised with him and associated ourselves close enough to even like him; maybe more than the lead character Jack Cates (Nolte). But this is where the films apparent familiarity comes into play; Reggie may have been a criminal and may have served two thirds of his sentence but he is a human being and his time out on unconventional parole is sugar coated with the re-occurring joke that he wants to have sex; this combining with the looming fact that towards the end, despite whatever he does to aid the capture/demise of the baddie; he will have to serve his whole sentence.But there can be few complaints about 48 Hrs. For its day, I could probably estimate that the film was better than it looks and feels now what with the buddy genre so popular back then. Murphy has made his career on buddy films this, the Beverly Hills Cop film, Metro and hell; even the Shrek films are buddy flicks. But here, that old combination of white guy/black guy is not only utilised to compliment the material but also as an excuse to include some really quite racial issues. After an obligatory opening when its established Cates is a cop with absolutely everything to loose, he turns to Hammond who 'knows the street' despite being away from it for two and a half years. From here, the white cop, black accomplice combination is played out to an effect seen in later films such as the third Die Hard picture. But the material on offer here is very racial Hammond is referred to behind his back as a 'soul brother' and is called 'charcoal' by Cates. Not only this but native Americans seem to get a bit of stick also. However, the one scene which balances it all up is the scene in the redneck bar in which Murphy rules the show. Yes, I 'got' the The French Connection reference when he parades them in the bar; publicly humiliating them as they stand there and he poses as a police man in what could be one of the most famous scenes from an 80s film.But apart from delve into some racial archetypes, the film keeps on a long and straight road; never veering off to be something it knows it cannot. The antagonists consist of their own interracial buddy two-some with Albert Ganz (Remar) and Ben Kehoe (James) forming their group and they get across a menacing persona that certainly remains there both on and off screen throughout. Even though 48 Hrs. is entertaining, it is only so because there is a nagging feeling at the back of the head that it's too familiar. Some of the decisions and reactions certain characters take and react to are fishy to say the least. One such scene near the beginning sees a police man on the stairs, bloody and shot, attempting to gun down a bad guy he has no bullets despite being off screen for a clear few minutes; did he not bother to check the chamber? Also, that same character decides to merely stand there when certain death looms and he is defenceless despite having a certain amount of time to get out of the situation. These scenes, like in any film, are incidental to the build up of the evil and menace of the antagonist who is the one that eventually kills him.Despite being involving and occasionally funny, the action scenes are messy and feel heavy handed at times with too many character a little too trigger happy. One character would rather shoot at Cates as he enters the apartment without any mention of anything he knows he's a cop (not sure how) and would prefer to murder him there and then than talk or merely initially run away. But this character is Luther (Kelly) and it is he who remains a constant and entertaining focus for the films middle segment. Everything seems to revolve around him as the antagonists have kidnapped his girlfriend as insurance; immediately having the audience 'side' with him. Luther acts as the reason for the cops and the robbers to combine in action sequences; the train station being a good example as well as the fetching of the car from the garage.If there are major complaints, it's that Hammond's re-occurring joke about wanting to have sex just goes too far; before long becoming insulting to the women he is talking to. There is also the very obvious air of the film dipping once it seems all is lost and the good guys have lost but wait, the bus that they were in; wasn't it from a certain place the cops know of? Let's go there and check. Sure enough, it gets them back on track as the film enters its final act. 48 Hrs. is a lot of fun but do not expect to be blown away by action or really witty dialogue. Likewise; these days this film is very 'buddy-by-numbers'.

I'd heard a lot about it and most people seemed to like it, so I thought it was worth a shot. But I must say I was disappointed. It was nothing like what I had anticipated.The plot was a bit confusing and the fist-fights looked real stupid (perhaps because the movie's pretty old by now...). Especially the one between Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, although that was one of the funniest parts of the movie.Murphy and Nolte created the Buddy-genre with this flick, but most of the film they're just spending time insulting each other (especially Nolte) as much as possible. Too much rough macho-talk, in my opinion. But Murphy was great in his break-through role as smooth, sweet-talking convict Reggie Hammond. This was the time when Murphy was still actually funny. And I must admit that Nick Nolte did a pretty good job playing the grumpy, stubborned police-officer Jack Cates.Cates and Hammond are teamed up to catch an old business pal of Hammond's, who happens to have escaped from prison with the help of an Indian gangster called Billy Bear. He also has got the old of Cates' gun and is using it to shoot cops with.I really thought this movie would be a lot more entertaining, and I also anticipated more chemistry between the two lead actors. Sometimes they came out alright together - after about half of the movie or so - but it was mostly Murphy who got the punch-lines. Nolte seemed like he was trying a little too hard to be a tough guy.I don't know. Maybe my biggest problem is that I saw this movie AFTER I'd seen the Lethal Weapon series. I'd like to say that Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte CREATED this film genre, but it was Mel Gibson and Danny Glover who DEFINED it. Sorry, but that's the way it is.I'm not saying this movie is bad, but if you liked it and would like to see a REALLY good buddy movie, I recommend Lethal Weapon. That's where you'll find the real Magic.

I think the reason they`re non existent these days is that it`s a genre that is very , very limited as anyone who has seen more than a very small handful of buddy movies can testify . It all comes down having a hard boiled cop matched up with a contrasting character and there you have it 48 HOURS is better than most simply down to the fact that it was a fairly original idea at the time and where the movie works best is with the violent thriller element . Some of the violence is quite shocking down to the fact that it`s so cold blooded . Take the  Nice gun  scene which is an uneasy scene to watch down to the cold calculating way the violence is dispensed . A murder scene doesn`t have to gory for it to be disturbing , something that I hope directors will take note of Where the film is less successful is when it`s trying to be amusing . I do confess I`ve always disliked Eddie Murphy down to the fact that he always seems to play the same wise cracking urbane black dude in every movie he`s appeared in and here he`s every bit as irritating as every movie he`s been in . Oh and did I spot a blunder where Murphy and Nolte`s characters are introduced at the prison cell block ? Nolte`s cop asks Murphy`s con to help him find a fugitive - Right in front of a crowded prison wing and Murphy agrees ! I was under the impression that if anyone did that in real life they`d get capped by the inmates before they left the gates . Failing that they`d be watching their back for the rest of their life on the outside , no one likes a prison stoolie How much you enjoy 48 HOURS comes down to how much you enjoy buddy movies . I enjoyed it in parts but as some people have already pointed out you can get too much of a good thing   "},{"Title":"Influential but sadly dated buddy-cop flick - 53%","Date":"27 June 2004","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Incredible as it seems, I had never watched this film before. OK, so I was 18 months old at the time of release but still... This is, arguably, the film that kick-started the buddy-cop era. Indeed, it's influence can be seen far and wide from movies such as Red Heat (1988) to TV shows like Due South. Incidentally, whatever happened to that? I loved the music...48 Hrs lays down the template for those to follow thusly Nick Nolte plays a hard-drinking, chain-smoking, heavy swearing cop who's as popular with his superiors as he is with those he busts. After seeing two cops gunned down, he is forced to spring wise-cracking petty criminal Eddie Murphy from jail in order to catch the punk. Problem is, he has only forty-eight hours in which to crack the case before Murphy must go back inside. Nolte is as flea-bitten as they come - a sort of adult version of Columbo, right down to the rust-ridden car. Murphy, on the other hand, is just Eddie Murphy and if you've seen any of his films then you'll know what I mean. If Beverly Hills Cop makes you want to scream then try watching this first. He still does his wise-cracks, that stupid laugh of his that sounds like an asthmatic breathing through a traffic cone and occasional shouting but he does do dramatic as well, though not terribly well. Still, not bad for a stand-up.I had two big problems with this picture. Firstly, it hasn't dated well at all. Every gun seems to be a six-shooter (though they frequently fire more than six times in a round) and has the same sound effect. Same too with the fist fight scene, which sounded as convincing as Jon Voight's accent in Anaconda. The music had a horrible Eighties vibe to it but not in a good way - if Grand Theft Auto Vice City can do it, why can't the real thing? The steel drums just didn't fit at all. Second, and more disturbingly, this picture has a strong element of racism throughout. An awful lot is made about the colour of Murphy's skin with racist language, jokes and even a scene set in a southern redneck tavern. Was there any real need for this? Yes, Murphy's black and Nolte's white. So what? Can't honestly say it made me feel comfortable, even so long after the picture's release.I'm sure that at the time, 48 Hrs was an exciting and entertaining picture. The world had yet to see anything like it - though cop movies were nothing new, it took a brave film like this to show that not all cops are the clean-cut individuals we'd like them to be. It felt more realistic to audiences than, say, Bullitt and so was doubtless successful on the back of that. But now, twenty-two years later, Eddie Can I Say Dick One More Time? Murphy is lending his voice to animated kiddie's film Shrek 2 while Nolte himself fell foul of the law by driving under the influence. Actually, he looks the same in his mug-shot as he does in this film. Funny old world. As for 48 Hrs, it failed to stir my senses enough to give it a thumbs-up. If only other cop films hadn't imitated this one quite so closely.

He's good. Nick Nolte is good. In 1982, this was quite the cop buddy film. Compared with modern standards in witty dialogue and action, the film still holds up but does not compete with Rush Hour, or even Beverly Hills Cop. The plot is solid and not goofy, but not especially compelling or clever either.Therefore, I would not recommend this movie as a straight comedy, nor to youngsters who have no reason to reminisce about the early 80's. Rent Trading Places instead, Eddy Murphy's 2nd film, which is still a classic, or see Showtime.Who should see this film-- Eddy Murphy fans who just have to see all his films-- Action lovers who have nothing better to do on a rainy day and would like to reminisce about the early 80s-- I can't think of anyone elseI rate 48 Hrs a 5 out of 10. "},{"Title":"A pretty average film that sticks to a formula that has become more and more worn every year since it's release in 1982","Date":"28 June 2004","Score":"4 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Working on a chain gang for another five years, killer Gantz escapes with the help of friend Billy Bear and heads to the city. Killing an old associate brings him to the attention of the police who dispatch three officers to catch him in his hotel. However when two of the officers are killed, the third (Jack Cates) makes it a personal matter. Looking for any lead he can get he agrees to get robber Reggie Hammond out of prison for 48 hours in exchange for information that brings Gantz in. However, although Reggie is a help to Cates he is also the biggest mouth that Jack has had to deal with &#150; will they find Gantz before they end up killing one another.I can't be sure but I'm pretty confident that this film was a bit dated and formulaic when it was released just over twenty years ago. Certainly watching it now it has dated very badly and it just about passes as a very basic 'mismatched partners' film that has been surpassed by many others down the years. In some respects maybe I am being unfair to this film because the formula has been repeated so often since 1982, but in other ways I can only go on what I see and on the whole this is a rather tired and unremarkable film that is enjoyable once but no more than that. The plot is rather daft and never really convinces as a thriller since it relies too heavily on coincidence, lazy plot devices and average writing. However, what it does do pretty well is create a few good set pieces; some of the comic set ups are quite enjoyable and some of the action scenes are a little exciting even if they are bit uninspired.This is less to do with the material and more to do with the delivery from the cast. Nolte and Murphy don't have that much chemistry together and they didn't do it for me in the way that buddy cop things usually need to &#150; but they did do OK on their own. Nolte is lumbered with a very clich√©d role (gruff, trouble with the captain and the lil' woman etc) but he manages to mumble his way thought reasonably well and it is acceptable that he only did the very basics there were required of him and no more. Eddie Murphy is better but only does his usual stuff (and not as well as he has other places. The lack of chemistry causes Murphy to struggle a bit but he has several scenes where his energy carries it. Of some interest as well is a support cast who have become more familiar with time; McRae is OK, Remar has made a career out of playing bad guys in average movies and is always worth seeing while James and Banks will be recognisable faces if not names. However I want to give special mention to Sonny Landham, not for his performance but for the movie connections he sets up here. His character is called Billy Bear and, in his final scene he holds a big knife. Nothing special about that until you think that his character in Predator was called Billy and used a big hunting knife! The second amusing thing for me was that Landham starred in a rarely scene film in the mid-nineties called 'Billy Lone Bear'! Of course neither of these bits of trivia make up for the fact that here he is monosyllabic and given almost nothing to do but be a big Indian, but they made me laugh when I realized them!Overall this is a pretty average film that sticks to a formula that has become more and more worn every year since it was made. At the time it may have cut the mustard but now it just looks tired and uninspired. Some of the comedy works and some of the action works but too much of it is flat. The cast has a collection of well-known faces in small roles but the lead two never really generate any chemistry between themselves, with only Murphy providing the odd good moment when he is given some good material to do his usual big-mouthed stuff &#150; sadly this doesn't happen anywhere near enough, making this a film that is passable but has outlived its shelf life.
