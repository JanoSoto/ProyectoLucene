[{"Title":"Justin Kerrigan hits gold.","Date":"8 June 1999","Score":"54 out of 63 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":" Director Justin Kerrigan.Justin Kerrigan - this time you've really done it. Human Traffic is going to upset the majority of film critics who will view the lack of plot, the drug induced dialogue and the futile outlook on Nineties Youth culture as a miserable and desperate view of how weekends are spent by ravers and clubheads across the UK. Moreover, they will spot camera work borrowed from Boogie Nights and even try and associate the whole film with 'Trainspotting' theme (because, lets face it, a Scottish Heroin addict trying to clean up his act and a Welsh clubber looking for a good time with his mates is pretty much the same thing, right?)Well wrong. Human Traffic has landed - along with one and a half quality hours of clubs, drugs, pubs and parties - and its time to leave behind your preconceptions of what a film should be like (where's the plot? I want a plot!) and instead delve into the lives of Jip (John Simm) and his mates, Nina (Nicola Reynolds), Koop (Shaun Parkes), Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington) and Moff (Danny Dyer). There's nothing special about these five friends; they're just hanging out together and showing you the way they lead their lives. They are not Burger King. They certainly don't do it your way. And you don't like it - well, tough.Because essentially this period piece has captured everything that Nineties youth culture is revolving around. There are no clear solutions, in fact very few problems in the first place. At the end of the day, what Jip and his friends are doing is living and who are we to know or comment on anything different? They drink, smoke dope, pop pills and party; they know the risks and they're prepared to take them and moralists will just have to sit back and (try to) enjoy the ride.The sound track is terrific and accompanies the highs and lows of the 48 hour weekend and the events that take place in it. But within this, what first appears to be social unity, we see traces of individual isolation that are easy to bypass in a culture of hedonism. Jips paranoia of sex, Koops jealous possession of Nina and Moff as his drug habit digs him deeper into his own hole and further away from his family, asks the question 'are things really this good?' However they will not be exaggerated to the extent that they are conspicuous, giving the film a controversial stance on drugs and the role in social integration. Kerrigan is pulling no punches. And why should he? This isn't GO! or any other such American rave film with clear cut margins and please-the-crowd conclusions - it is one that forces us to question whilst at the same time enjoy the at times hilarious, touching and other times exciting events of 48 hours with a group of five 'friends'.And for the die-hard British youth among you, this might not be reality - but it's a bloody brave effort at depicting it.

This movie rocks!","Date":"8 January 2001","Score":"46 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":"  This film was hilarious.  It provided a somewhat comical view of the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a funny thing.  The characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves.There were a few pivotal scenes which really made this movie work the getting ready scenes; the Get me a real doctor scene; the white background scene showing each character in a total state of being wrecked, ending with the infamous line what was i saying? and the comedown-sunup scenes.  I have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviour.I can't give this movie a 10 because it doesn't measure up to Groove, which I thought was out of this world, but it certainly has its moments.  The mise-en-scene and the camera work is superb, the special effects are well worth mentioning, and the acting is fantastic.After waiting a long time to see this film, I am glad to say that I was not disappointed.  I hope to see more from the writer/director in the future.

It would have to accurately reflect the lives and experiences of 'clubbers' and also appeal to a wider audience. Human Traffic just about achieves that.It is certainly spot on in with it's observations and in it's accuracy. It's obvious the filmmakers have 'been there and done it'. If you are or were once like the people in this film, than there is so much to relate it. It's all there, often depicted humorously but not condescendingly. The fake euphoria of being on 'E'in the end ,I just want to be happy, yeah ,that's it.....hang on, what the **** was I talking about?. The monged conversation at 4 am which seems deep and meaningful but is basically rubbish  Star Wars being about drugs!and gets more and more incoherent. Exchanging pleasantries with someone you only see in pubs and clubs and really can't stand. 'Coming up' suddenly at the same time as someone else and mumbling to each other what you're 'on' at the speed of light. Reminiscing how it was better in the 'old days' and is now too commercial and widespread. Doing it all for the first time and going off with a bunch of dodgy geezers who are suddenly your best mates. The thrill of finding the after party. The depressing, inexorable sense of returning to the reality.The film's attitude to drugs is commendable, drug taking is simply something the characters do, and that's all. Nobody dies or is seriously ill ,and yet there is a sense that it doesn't really lead anywhere. After all ,we'll not going to be doing this for ever, are we says one character at the end.The film falters a little when depicting the lives of it's protagonists. For many scenes, director Justin Kerrigan uses a kind of 'heightened reality', for instance in a scene when a character comments on how the workers in a fast food place are like robots and for a moment they 'become' actual robots. This approach does not always work, and it's a shame since the characters are all the sort you could expect to run into on a Friday night. We do care a bit about their respective lives and problems, but we don't really get to know the female characters properly, and what is really the main thrust of the plot, the blossoming romance between two of the main protagonists, is dwelled on too much and is somehow unconvincing,if sometimes quite sweet. The acting is generally OK if not great.Human Traffic is not as important a film as, say, Trainspotting, which despite being about heroin addicts seemed to speak to a generation. Nonetheless, it's a truthful depiction of an element of society which films and TV either ignore or condescend to. Incidentally ,there are two versions, the director's edit and the later producer's edit. The latter, which cuts some footage, changes some music and adds some silly CGI, is inferior to the former.

This film is a great debut for the writer/director - well done mate!The acting is great, all the characters are believable and are larger than life! The 'weird' scenes are a joy to watch, Jip's running Mr floppy flashbacks/explanations/visualizations are all great! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone stands up and starts singing the mock national anthem is a laugh too. There's loads of comedy here - Howard Marks' 'spliff politics' speech is hilarious!Oh god, you just need to see this. Mind you, I felt the film did somewhat glorify the use of ecstacy, but hey, that's the truth of the matter eh? At least the film doesn't shy away from this fact. I suppose the film does carry a decent message to it as well - don't take life TOO seriously, you have to let you hair down sometime. And of course the chat in the pub when Moff tries to explain to his mates that he's coming off the drugs is a sure reminder that when the come down's out-way the good times, you know the party's over!This is at times a very clever film in it's use of the camera, lighting, etc. It was a realised piece of cinema, and a great feel-good tale of mates, love, clubs, and drugs.Get outta the 'rat race' people!!!8/10Enjoy!

We follow a group of friends from their jobs to their Friday night highs.  Jip is having erection problems, Koop mistrusts his girlfriend, Lu has just split from her most recent boyfriend and Nina is preparing to let her brother take E for the first time.  They all hate their jobs, but the weekend gives them an opportunity to get away.When this came out it got both horrible reviews and good reviews, so I didn't know totally what to expect, but I expected to hate it because it marked itself out from the very start as one of those very self-aware 'youf' movies.  However, although that's exactly what it is, I did actually enjoy it nonetheless.  There is not a plot so much as a weekend experience and it does struggle at times without a frame of any sort.  However while it is hitting the spot and being energetic and funny it doesn't matter.  The odd time it tries to give the characters specific issues or lives it tends to hurt itself but for the majority it works.The script is funny with nice imaginative touches blended with real life club/drug culture/pub culture references and settings to make it identifiable and interesting.  I suppose it very much depends on who you are. If you are not part of that scene or have no knowledge of it then it may just seem like a big pointless waste of time.  For me, much of it was recognisable regardless of what I have done or have not done.  While some of it was unknown to me, I still found it funny and was able to relate to much of it.  It is very clear about it's stance on drugs (with a not-so-subtle clip of Bill Hicks just to ram the point home) but at least it shows the immediate bad side if not the longer lasting effects; the comedown/hangover scenes are pretty much fair and balanced, as are the scenes of enjoyment and fun brought by drugs.  However to compare this film to Trainspotting is a joke! The latter was very clearly showing a balanced view of drugs, whereas this film is less balanced, and is more about the pleasure, being aimed at the user market.The cast are young and lively and deal well with the material without ever impressing.  Parkes seems the most comfortable with his role, although Davies convinces in a speeded up dealer performance.  Simm is lumbered with the narration but does OK but there are no really good female characters compared to the men.Overall this is worth seeing if you can relate to it and get laughs from seeing people you recognise in the characters.  However if, after 10 minutes you can't see what the point of the whole thing is and it just seems noisy and stupid then it's likely not aimed at you and you're better off without it.  Either way it isn't great but if you get it, it is energetic and funny enough to watch.

It reminded me of a UK version of Cameron Crowe's Singles but a hell of a lot more fun. I loved the scene where the main character makes up a new national anthem (one he identifies with). This movie is worth watching for that scene alone.  Human Traffic doesn't provide much insight into the human condition, but that's not what it's trying to do. It's just about a group of young people trying to figure out their lives at that point in time. It's definitely a great film if you want to watch characters who lead even more pointless lives than you. The place was different, but in my early twenties I saw some of my own traits (namely the pursuit of fun and women) in the male characters.

This film did not strike even a similar chord. The directors of 'Human Traffic' may have some off-hand experience of ecstasy, but there is no demonstration of actual drug-related semantic knowledge here. In fact, I find it rather offensive and contraproductive to the strife of making current drug laws less politically oriented.Watch 'Requiem for a Dream' if what you're looking for is an amazing, touching film about drugs.

It's a music video from the early 90's that summarises both the exhilaration and emptiness of being a clubber, it lasts 12 minutes and is vastly more entertaining than this film.I'd be extremely suprised if the director/director of Human Traffic has another story to tell.

The film finishes more or less where it started, nothing of any consequence happens and there are no particular features in the story.

The situations are unsubtle exaggerations which make the the already flimsy characters even more unbelievable and detestable.

It's no surprise because that's really all the film is, a documented and filmed account of what it's like to rave and club; for the rest of us, it's a non-event; a moderately dramatic and slightly inventive drama about British young adults that try to kill off sensations of pain to do with stresses of work, flailing relationships and even the actual lack of them. Human Traffic is a very specific film in the sense it is going to appeal to a direct audience; the illusion that the audience are seeing something better than what it is lies in the surrealistic content that has wormed its way into the film thanks to other recent attempts at the time such as Trainspotting and The Acid House. On the other hand, the filmmakers are not fooling anyone else.The trouble with the film is its study of this particular mentality. The defining scene is about half way through the film in which a couple of the main characters stand on a stairway to a large, old manor house and systematically turn around to the camera to address us. If you're struggling for a visualisation, think the opening few seconds of the music video to that Spice Girls song from years back entitled 'Wannabe'. As they turn to face us, they talk and laugh in our direction about how brilliant the night's going to be and how they love doing what they do. The problem here is that rather than see the night through the eyes of one of the characters, the highs and lows but hopefully not too much of either without the highs glamorised; we are invited to see the scenes unfold through our own perspective that is the camera's POV.This means whatever viewpoint or opinion we have on these people and this lifestyle will stick throughout this sequence, meaning if you're into it you'll be loving it but if it's all alien to you in the first place, you'll probably be despising what's going on. We are not invited to participate through one of the characters, instead we must watch from outside the box as events unfold in a dreary fashion.The film is one of those driven by lifestyle and consequence rather than out and out narrative. There is a lot of narration establishing the life certain people lead as well as several scenes that kill time whilst coming across as quite eccentric afterthoughts, the scene in which everyone stands up in the pub and sings at the camera being one of them. Jip (Simm) is the narrator and is so all over the place, both in speech and movement, that he manages to go from mentioning Neil Armstrong to talking of Milky Bar chocolate bars in one monologue spanning about four seconds. Such is the nature of the film.Simm plays the character well, a sort of eccentric person who's on the brink between being perfectly normal and completely loosing his mind completely. Simm hates his life and 'lives for the weekend' where he can let loose and try to scratch that itch of not having had a partner in ages. Initially, Jip is conflicted on his lifestyle after all this time. He initially seems to be on the brink of an epiphany but he doesn't know it. It looks as if he's about to mature, questioning his lifestyle and coming to terms with the damage he's doing to himself. Unfortunately, the film does cop out towards the end with this idea and has Jip find a partner, thus halting the possible maturity stone dead. All of a sudden he's happy with his lifestyle and nothing seems so bad after all, which was disappointing.Along with Jip are Koop (Parkes); Lulu (Pilkington) and Moff (Dyer). What they get up to is slightly uninteresting at the best of times, their activity only demonised on the rare occasion Danny Dyer narrates what it's like to come down off drugs at a bash full of random people all doing the same thing. The film is all style, with its study of the British male in crisis filling in the rest. Jump cuts; breaking the fourth wall; subtitles and popular culture dialogue are the attempts at coming across as somewhat different to what you might have expected. For watching ravers, it'll add to the disillusioned sense they might already have while watching but for everyone else, it's just quite ordinary and often comes across as a bit of a gimmick.Very near the film's immediate beginning is a short monologue about how a 17 year old boy hopes to have sex for the first time on a night out with the characters. This will instil some viewers with dread as to what might come; others will probably laugh their heads off and miss the subsequent thirty seconds of the film through that laughter. Human Traffic can be added to list containing Trainspotting and The Acid House as surrealist, realist drama comedies made in Britain around about the turn of the decade. It isn't as good as those films because it doesn't feel grounded. The film might just as well have been shot with real ravers on a real night out, but of course where's all the director's post-modern style going to come from then? After all, we've got to have all that in there- haven't we?

Moff's rants make this film somewhat bearable as you look forward to his stories of getting drugged up, calling a porn line and spouting his life story and subsequently running up a whopping phone bill!Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good comedy and probably even more-so a good british comedy but i can't defend or compliment this film in any great deal because it does not serve the purpose of a comedy- it is not funny! Scenes where they make an alternative national anthem and quote some of the music that they hate are simplistic and inadequate at getting laughs from an audience. My advice to anyone who wants to watch this film is to rent it rather than buy it because I am desperatly looking for a prospective buyer as this will be used as a surface to put my remote in future.Overall I had good expectations of this film but after watching it realise none of those expectations were fulfilled a poor script, probably a bunch of the most un-magnetic actors(with the exception of Moff) ever assembled and a dire plot make for a bitter one and a half hours where you'll be constantly checking your timer to see if your anywhere near the end of the film.I would give this film a generous 2 out of 10 which are for Danny Dyer's humourous character Moff and a reasonable soundtrack "},{"Title":"Any film with Bill Hicks AND Howard Marks can't fail..surely?","Date":"15 July 2000","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":"  At its end, HUMAN TRAFFIC has hit one note quite charmingly for a breezy ninety minutes, not overstaying its welcome, but never in danger of becoming anything more than a curiosity to its audience.In fact, it begs the question why the opening credits interspersed footage of protests against the draconian Criminal Justice Bill with scenes of revelry. The film cops out at every opportunity to make a serious comment on disillusioned youth, tied to mind-numbing jobs, a drug generation needing an escape. Any film which contains an affectionate tribute to the prophet Bill Hicks (the best, most astute and concerned stand-up comedian that ever lived), and an inspired cameo from Howard Marks surely demands a bit more substance.But HUMAN TRAFFIC never allows you to linger on its flaws. It adopts an entirely disjointed narrative, liable to go off on tangents at any stage, for any interval. You get the suspicion the filmmakers think there is something especially inventive about the surreal treatment (which extends little further than illusion sequences and direct-to-audience addresses). But it hardly matters whether the visual tricks hit-or-miss, they offer a surprising, and refreshing way of extending a slim idea out to a relatively full 90 minutes.Justin Herrigan actually develops the characters to the extent you can't help but care about them. Honest in their weaknesses, they are easy to relate to. He should be applauded for extending the appeal of the film beyond an exclusive target audience. It would be inadvisable to compare it with the much stronger TRAINSPOTTING and TWIN TOWN, although all three are refreshingly different. HUMAN TRAFFIC is an affectionate, semi-autobiographical account of modern culture.

Through the Ecstacy-induced high to the alcohol-assisted comedown to the feelings of the morning after, their lives are on the brink of changing forever When 'Human Traffic' was released, many critics claimed that this was the last great British film of the nineties &#x96; and how right they were. This film is so inherently a nineties movie, it's like opening a time capsule. To be young was to be a clubber; to be living for the weekend, when mixing alcohol with drugs was a given. Writer-director Justin Kerrigan captures that oxymoronic feeling of immortality and insecurity beautifully, through five characters that complement each other so well.Obviously, the success of the characters hinges entirely on the success of the actors, and what 'Human Traffic' also gives you is a snapshot into what would (and could) become the future of British cinema. Top of the pile is John Simm, who went on to achieve well-deserved acclaim for Life On Mars. This is arguably his breakthrough performance, and he's a joy to watch.But, in my honest opinion, the plaudits need to go to Danny Dyer. For those with a decent knowledge of Dyer will know that he is mostly known now for playing really rubbish characters in really rubbish films. But in 'Human Traffic', he is brilliant. The character of Moff isn't the nicest &#x96; he is hooked on drugs, isn't overly intelligent, and is desperate for friends &#x96; but Dyer imbues that unlikeable character with a childlike innocence which you warm to. It's by far the best performance I've ever seen from him, and makes me realise why he managed to keep a career going. The rest of the cast is made up of actors who have since faded into the distance; which, to be honest, isn't surprising as the performance levels don't match up to Simm and Dyer. While everyone has moments of good work, it is never quite as consistent. I feel like there were better young actors at the time who could have done a better job.You could argue that the film is a bit dated, and it's not a bad argument to make. Obviously, the youth of the nineties is a lot different from the youth of today. But for those who were part of the nineties generation, 'Human Traffic' provides the same feeling of nostalgia that 'Trainspotting'. Both are films stuck in time, but not in a way that hurts them. 'Human Traffic' is a love letter to the nineties, and well worth a watch.

The scene he has with Koop towards the latter part of the film is especially good as they stare, drug-addled and fascinated looking down at a table. The film did have its cringe-worthy moments (perhaps the Alternative National Anthem being one) but it's saved by other moments of clever insight into Human interaction such as the scene where Jip has to talk to a guy who he admits isn't actually an unpleasant person but he just doesn't like him and the dialogue, direction and performances perfectly convey the thoughts that have run through everyone's head at some stage in life when we are desperate to extricate ourselves from a strained conversation which we wish we hadn't had to enter into in the first place.

I listen to a wide range of music, and have gone clubbing in both the US and UK over the stretch of the 90's, so this topic isn't entirely Greek to me. And I have no problem with a movie that wishes to explore the highs and lows of said culture - many have complained about the 'lack of plot' of this movie. That is not what bothered me. Instead, I found this to be highly derivative and manipulative. The constant voice overs did not serve the same function they did in, say, Trainspotting (though that film had a plot, as well as something to say.) They instead seemed to be another tactic to wrangle the viewer in and create a false bond. A cheap ploy. Like, when Moff goes on about what a great time he's having being off his pickle, and then, eyes at the viewers' vantage point, stutters ya', ya' know what I mean? Cushty! I know you wouldn't let me down! I knew it! (paraphrase.) This seems to be there to create a sort of 'secret club' bond between the viewer and characters in the film. It happens several times again, but that's one of the more blatant examples I can think of.Another thing that bothered me about this movie was that it used other manipulative tactics, just under different guises, so as to not alienate any of the potential viewers. Like when they're in the pub, 'bonding' over music they hate. Well, they groups they name drop are so mind-numbingly obvious in their 'badness' or 'cheesiness' that there's no way it could offend someone even lightly into the club scene. They list stuff like Backstreet Boys and Hanson. I think Hanson was already pretty much dead and gone by '99. There are about 10 other groups listed, but it's the same monster. If these were kids that were hardcore into club music/DJ culture, they'd instead list DJs they thought were whack. But it seems they refrain from doing this to keep it safe and inclusive b/c God forbid they name drop a DJ they dislike and it alienates a viewer. Don't even get me started on the redo of the National Anthem!! ...It's hard being cool! Pretty gusty of you all to say, as I don't consider any of you cool. Maybe a bit more modesty and instead ...It's hard TRYING to be cool... Another sloppy mistake,in what could have been an amusing scene, was where the jaded older club-goers ranted about how things have changed and it just isn't the same now as it was back in their heyday. What they mix up is during the 'Summer of Love flashback, by listing the date as 1991. Anyone who has a rudimentary understanding of rave culture knows the Summer of Love was '89. But that's I guess just a triviality to Kerrigan (writer/director).There are MANY more faults I have with this film, like, for example, who working retail like about half of the cast gets full weekends off? If you're lucky, you get one of the two days off. If you want Sat/Sun off, you often have to ask special permission, usually to much chagrin from your boss. Also, for such 'seasoned' club regulars, isn't Friday a bit of a 'tourist's' night to go out? What about Tuesday, etc...? One more thing...They make fun of other groups they fit into mock-able 'tribes' (such as the 'students' back from Amsterdam potheads - who I know are annoying, but are they really more annoying than the five leads? - or the hip hop junkies you can more or less talk nonsense to in order to jack up the price of an LP.) I just found that another manipulative tactic. Another 'you're one of us, you're in the cool crowd'.I think Kerrigan got lucky to an extent by bagging a few decent actors who clearly tried hard and gave high energy performances. For me, the funniest character featured was Danny Dyer/Moff. He had the only parts that really made me laugh, such as the Taxi Driver scene, phone sex story, and ill-fated mirror debacle. He was the most believable and the most entertaining. Though I will deduct points for the Star Wars party rant. Can we just stop it with those, even back in '99, they were played out! Kevin Smith has long had the monopoly on these, and they felt fresh when he did them. And seeing a Clerks poster in Jip's room made me somewhat suspicious. Also, the joke at the end about kids in the future having to smoke Moff's ashes b/c he's done all the drugs was ripped off almost VERBATIM from a Dennis Leary joke about Keith Richards off of his 'No Cure for Cancer' comedy album. I'm not overly familiar with Bill Hicks, but many accuse Leary of ripping HIM off, so it's pretty bad when you can trace some of the jokes so easily.I just don't get the accolades this movie has amassed, particularly over the last decade,making it some sort of cult classic. Was I entertained?Mildly. Did I find it realistic? Perhaps if they hadn't tried so freaking hard. But it was a bit of a hot mess. I'm not trying to rag on anyone who relates or likes it, I just feel this film was a cheap attempt to cash in on the end of the century so-called 'electronica'(hate that word)craze. I guess it succeeded.But in my opinion, it leaves MUCH to be desired...

These scenes felt very much like a dark version of Scrubs, from Jip having an argument with an imaginary punter in his car, talking to someone thinking about taking drugs for the first time in a classroom and it was all pretty funny. Jip also broke the fourth wall, which reminded me of Saved by the Bell, weird.Director Justin Kerrigan knows where to place to place the camera and he does make a stylist film. But there is not much of a plot, it is simply about a night out. The atmosphere in the club did fill real and people ho enjoy techno music will like the soundtrack.

(No? Then I guess you've never met me because all my friends have.) Once that happens what does the storyteller always say? I guess you had to be there! That's Human Traffic in a nutshell, if you weren't there in some capacity then it is just about a bunch of young d*ckheads running around talking sh*t and taking drugs, but if you are the low side of 40 then perhaps at one time it is quite likely that YOU were one of the young d*ckheads running around and talking sh*t, drugs and/or alcohol may or may not have been a factor too.My clubbing era was reasonably brief, maybe 19 through 24ish, but during that span I had 15 nights that at least vaguely resembled the night the 5 main characters have in Human Traffic, without much of the snappy dialogue and cutscenes though.The five characters should be irrelevant and largely interchangeable, but in this film the casting is great and they all have sufficient time that we learn about who they are and what makes them tick.They are Jip &#x96; the Everydude. A low-ranking office employee who hates the workaday life and lives for the weekend. Oh, and he has a mum who is a hooker.Koop &#x96; Jip's best mate. A super-cool record shop employee in the way that you can only be in your late teens or early 20s. (Record shop employees in their 40s are simply sad or creepy.) Nina &#x96; Koop's missus. A fast-food chain employee who is chatty and friendly.Lulu &#x96; The dizzy blonde love interest. I tried to think of more ways to describe her but came out dry, the only underdone character in the film.Moff &#x96; That guy who is a little too intense and you worry about one day he'll just snap, but is fun to have around the periphery. (It also helps that he is a small time pusher and they are all small time users.) The film is very British, there are no concessions to slang and accents. Everyone talks varying degrees of rubbish and often they talk aforementioned rubbish direct to camera. Embedded in between almost every major scene are several pseudo-skits that shouldn't work, featuring the main characters and their interactions with various other citizens, posers, authority figures and relatives. I say shouldn't work but they all seem to, in fact the only one that gets me leaning towards the FF button on the remote is one where they re-make the British anthem, everything else adds to the film.So once we've met the whipper-snappers we get to follow them from the drudgery of a Friday spent at work, all the way through the best parts of the weekend as a single, carefree teen, (sob).1/ Pre night warm-up. Psyching each other up, convincing everyone to show up and getting the pre-night alcohol buzz.2/ The round trip to pick everyone up. (This is where the film lies a bit, assuming someone actually volunteers to remain sober and be skipper their night is already ruined. Here the skipper is always Jip, who never seems short of a beer or some pills.) 3/ The pre-gig drinks at the local.4/ The gig. (In this case they must cadge their way in as they are short of tix.) 5/ The initial slowdown&#x85; followed by the second wind! 6/ The post gig early am house party. Gibberish conversations, paranoia and arguments.7/ The next morning never again personal promise.8/ The next evening debrief at the pub. (Which if all goes well used to lead to the Saturday evening starting back at 1/.Amazingly enough the film always seemed to capture the best bits and worst bits of every stage of the day, even in a 90 odd minute film. Perhaps it is because as I was watching the movie I was in fact recalling similar events from the period that I was doing the same stupid sh*t that these guys were, I dunno.In any case Human Traffic is the rarest of rare, a concept movie that takes a lot of risks yet actually works.It was written and directed by a young bloke too, because I don't think a 40 year old would be able to make this film and accurately convey the vibe that comes across.I know I couldn't, (I'm still a little ways away from 40). I've inevitably moved beyond the work is slavery, the Man is out to get you and Bill Hicks is a genius era. Now I think work is unfortunately necessary (but granted it feels like slavery), the Man is not out to get us, (but he ain't there to help us neither), and Bill Hicks was incredibly over-rated and spouts a lot of sh*t that druggies and idiots grab onto to justify their own decisions and inadequacies.Phew, what else is there? A cracking soundtrack (even a decade plus on), real actors without the US standard 10/10 hunks and goddesses with massive fakies, and a very convincing, yet quite naïve; message that damn it drugs are f*cking great! Final Rating &#x96; 8 / 10. The DVD cover sums it up nicely The weekend has landed&#x85; all that's left are clubs, drugs, pubs and parties. Meet Human Traffic.

I went into this movie with pretty high expectations, and it was all downhill from there.This movie was supposed to be this archetypal movie on the drug culture of the early 90's, and was going to allow us all to see inside this scene, and shatter the media's preconceptions following the moral panic which followed the death of Leah Betts in 1995. Unfortunately it has fallen a long way short. Where Trainspotting was able to treat you like an adult on the subject, and potential problems that surround drugs, this just provided us with some schmaltzy tale of the wonder of drugs, and how it can like, you know, like totally open your mind. Cue some guff about Bill Hicks, and Howard Marks ad nausea. It is painfully bad at times. I mean, the scene at the end between Lulu and her Auntie actually made me laugh out loud.Now maybe I am just a cynic, but the way Jip leads us through this tale is like listening to THAT Acid frazzled guy you once met at a house party, who talks to you about how the man is holding us back, and how Acid has released him from the strains of modern society. You just wanna shake some sense into him, and ask him to leave the premises.The script was a real problem for me, because where Trainspotting had Irvine Welsh's excellent book to cite from, this is written and directed by Justin Kerrigan. The words Jack of all trades, master of none come to mind. You can see where his inspiration comes from, particularly in the style of narration from main character Jip (which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera, and outlines what is going through his mind as the scenario plays out) The problem with this is that some of the speeches to camera are just painful to watch. Mainly this comes down to a lack of empathy for Jip, but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average A-Level drama project. The direction is fine, and the intentions are good, but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about.Saying that though, it is not all bad. There are moments which are genuinely very amusing, and entertaining. Moff is the highlight of the movie for me. For an independent movie it also managed to attract a high numbers of quality British actors/actresses, which maybe outlines why there was such a buzz about the movie.Best movie of the 90's? Not by a long shot, but if you're looking for a solid Sunday night movie, then this might just be your bag. Inevitably though, the movie is flawed by the hype that surrounds it.

So, in the presence of time I watched both- and found nothing but the Polygram-'Trainspotting' approach. That is, when Quentin Tarantino has made it big with 'Pulp Fiction' & 'Reservoir Dogs', mimic it with a safe imitation and similar marketing the soundtrack albums, the post-modern intertextual reference to previous film-makers. Except Tarantino has seen lots of films- so we get refs to 'Band a Part', 'Slam Dance' etc. 'Trainspotting' made ref to 'Pulp Fiction' and Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' (despite the freeze-frame thing coming from 'Jules et Jim'). 'Lock, Stock' was just packed full of Scorsese imitations- any semblance of originality extracted. 'Human Traffic' is more of this empty, demograph marketed emptiness- which makes lazy references to 'Star Wars'...The acting is probably not that bad- it is hard to act with an abysmal script that ponders such depths as maintaining an erection and sitting round in a pub talking about nothing (for no particlular reason). This is generation zero...The soundtrack is mediocre drivel- out of date as the film came out and why do we get reference to the 'jilted generation' rioting against the Government restrictions forced onto them? I s'pose the director saw 'La Haine'- how these people from the early 90's rave scene (I was there)- who has open minds and were into eclectism relate to the steretotypes offered up as characters in the film is perplexing...John Simm's character has the embarrassing sub-plot involving his prostitute-mother (it is quite funny...) and we have stupid fantasy-scenes where he is in the car with one of his mothers suitors. Terrible- look to 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' or 'Requiem for a Dream' for how this should be done; or even 'Belle du Jour'...The gang of empty heteros spend a typical weekender night in Cardiff- but it could be any British city. They're all the same, apart from the accents overpriced lager that tastes like piss, bouncers who believe they have significance, girls & the boys all dressed the same who speak the same lines and have the same ambition of shagging etc. So, they sit around in a pub thinking they are very smart-arse,a bloke from 'This Life' pops up and we have a sub-Annie Hall comment on how we behave etc- to fill up time on-screen. Then, after drinking corporate bottled lager etc. they go clubbing, neck 'e's and we have the inevitable uniform camerawork & editing. Then the come down and the tedious love-story/shagging scene (which is very 'Trainspotting'). Then, oh, it's Sunday morning and back to normality- where I come from Monday morning is back to reality!...So, an excerable example of so-called British cinema- the director with the follow-up 'SW9' (marketed as 'Pulp Fiction' meets 'Trainspotting' on posters!) proves he has an absence of ideas (as does Guy Ritchie- making two mediocre Cockney-wanka flicks back to back!). This is neither a comment on the music scene of the UK- '24 Hour Party People' is more likely to succeed- taking us to the Hacienda, 'Voodoo Ray' etc- where it progressed from the mid/late 80's to the hardcore/jungle meltdown of the mid 90's (when everyone began to listen to so-called real music again- Oasis, Blur etc. Porridge rock). This film just shows ciphers when clubbing is about as revolutionary and interesting as going down the disco in the late 70's/early 80's...Read 'Energy Flash' and watch Flowered Up's 'Weekender' to get a glimpse at the world 'Human Traffic' completely fails to capture.

A bunch of 5 mates are deeply bored in this town. There's Jip who works in a clothes shop. Coop, an easy-going DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing the week-end. At this time, they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music, they experience different drugs, particularly ecstasy. Then, they usually continue the party to a friend's. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the feelings are the following ones tiredness, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night...Surfing on the wave of the notorious success of Trainspotting (1996), this debut movie written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation about the notion of hedonism. It means how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time. Indeed, as I have previously written, for the 5 main characters of the movie, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure (besides, Jip in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting oneself you are numb, you don't feel any pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth. Kerrigan's relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and care freeness of the 5 protagonists. They only live to take advantage as much as possible of an hedonist week-end. Furthermore, to spice up a little more the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes, Kerrigan isn't afraid to include dreamlike sequences which represent his characters' fantasy or embarrassments. Then, Human Traffic (1999) is also served by a particularly bouncy sound track. The amount? A perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music. At last, this week-end of euphoria enables to shelve momentarily the usual drab image of the popular social classes, British cinema has studied a lot.Notwithstanding, when a movie (conscientiously or not) exploits the fame of another famous one, it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor. Human Traffic is in this condition. There's little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless digressions (Jip who, in the nightclub goes in the manager's office and tells him a cock-and-bull story so as to enable Moff to enter the club but that's no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems). One can also blame Kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved. His movie can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole aren't virtually explored. It's a shame! It could have conveyed the following message even in the happiest moments, there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them. The same remark could also be said when Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina broaches a guy.It may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the DVD cover but Human Traffic is to be taken as a good and incisive little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the twentieth century, a will to have fun without ulterior motives and trouble. An ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club.

The film follows five friends in their twenties and we observe the characters' lifestyle over a weekend period. All of the characters live tedious lives during the week and use the weekend as an opportunity to escape their misery. The group of friends includes Jip (John Simm) who is sexually paranoid. Koop (Shaun Parkes) is suspicious of his girlfriend cheating on him. Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington) is fed up with men following a number of bad relationships. Nina (Nicola Reynolds) is eager to introduce her seventeen year old brother to drugs and Moff (Danny Dyer) is unemployed and dependant on his parents. The characters were well introduced in the opening scenes and as the plot unfolded the story developed their individual traits. All five are very authentic and true to life. Their weekend is not complete without drugs, clubs and parties. I can guarantee you will either know or have met people similar to them, and the five of them have a lot in common which brings them together. The film was written and directed by Justin Kerrigan who is from Cardiff. I can only imagine that the film tells the story of past experience he has gone through. I was very shocked when I discovered this was his first feature length film and even more surprised that he's not done much since. Jip (Simm) is the lead character in this film and he delivers an excellent performance. He has an equal amount of both dialogue and narration. I often feel narration in films is only used because the writer had struggled to put it into dialogue. However, I didn't feel it with this, as the narration from Jipps character felt very real. He constantly had thoughts on his mind and narration worked much better to portray this than the dialogue would have.Human Traffic has a lot of energy in it and has a level of madness which makes the genre a light hearted comedy. I had no idea what direction the film was going in as there were various sub-plots and comedy skits from all five of the characters, which I was very entertained by. The language in the dialogue is very realistic and the actors do a fantastic job as well. My only one complaint is that only one of the main characters actually seemed to be Welsh. The rest of the cast without involving the extras appeared to sound very English. I suppose this is better than them attempting a poor Welsh accent, and maybe they deliberately used English actors to make English people relate to. Alternatively, they probably couldn't find any Welsh actors that suited the role. This isn't something I'd recommend to everyone as it doesn't have a wide target audience. I would suggest young people who experienced the club culture especially in the 90s in Britain would be particularly attracted to this film. However, I was very entertained by it and I could relate to the characters very well. Human Traffic is however a post-modern film and what I enjoyed the most was the authenticity and hilarity.

Although this isn't a particularly original premise, it is handled in such a way that gives it a spin and makes it memorable. Along the way in takes in the traditional values of love and friendship and also offers some perspective on how those relate to drug use.The cast of mostly unknown actors do an outstanding job here. Although there are moments in the film where it seems as if the actors are on the verge of stepping out of character and the fairly low budget of the movie about to rear it's head, this never happens. They breathe soul into the script and have fun with some of the more surreal elements of the movie.Although the story is mostly linear, and spends quite a bit of time discussing the history of the lead characters, it is kept very entertaining and often hilarious by the unexpected moments of surrealism and time dilation demonstrated here, which can often be achieved by the use and abuse of mind-bending drugs. The 'new British anthem' was both touching and amusing simultaneously. Some of these little interludes are a mere few seconds long which makes them high on shock value, a technique I quite liked. The camera work often does give you an insight into what the effects of the drugs are like, often claustrophobic or wide-angled at all the right moments.But like all outstanding works and the very drugs the movie describes, description doesn't prepare you for the actual experience. Certainly this movie could have been a better one given a higher budget and more scrupulous editing, but I've seen much worse that cost much more.A great effort and a genuine twist on contemporary film-making. 8/10 "},{"Title":"overly flashy portrayal of Brit club scene but accurate","Date":"2 May 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music","Review":" i rate this film 9 out of 10 because it is a highly accurate portrayal of this British club scene of the 90's. it also does a pretty good job of not totally glamorising drugs, a little like trainspotting.the problem i had with this film is what other people have mentioned about the over use of flashy camera techniques in order to help you connect with the feelings the characters are experiencing whilst on drugs. I felt that although this technique did work it still flet a little like you were in an overly bright disco with the disco ball revolving round and round!

But as the movie progresses it really grasps the real problems surrounding this generation of people.It is not a particularly 'clever' movie, like trainspotting is, but its blatant message is presented very strongly through the various characters and their interactions with each other. There were a few characters that were brought in to the plot but in the end were not really explored, like the 17 year old brother, which would have made an interesting character.Human Traffic is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen and its satirical humour and dark realism really makes this a movie worth seeing.

It's packed full of hilarious moments and interludes (I will never forget the ever important Spliff Politics), but the meat and potatoes of this film are the relationships between the characters.When sober, they're a seemingly normal group of friends. Under the influence, their true selves come out and the movie is VERY true to life about how people feel and act on clubbing chemicals (one of the director's requirements was that all actors had to have taken the drugs involved).This movie is definitely more enjoyable if you've done the things that are depicted in it, as the visuals trigger memories of how you felt when you're going crazy and you were as high as they look.If you haven't done drugs, you likely aren't going to get this movie, and unless you're really interested, you should probably skip it. However, if you're the sort to pop a couple candies, snort a rail and hit the clubs, this movie is DEFINITELY for you.

I think this is a film that you are going to either love or hate, and I think that most people who like will be in a position where they can relate to it, and most who don`t cant. And I`m not going to comment on the fluidity or credability of the story, the quality of the acting or anything else like that. What I do want to do is point out somethings that I feel some people may have missed.There are so many references to it copying Trainspotting... hardly. Trainspotting deals with the hardship and desperation that come with being a full time skag head. Human Traffic deals with the hassles of working in a boring dead end job and looking forward to the weekend where you can really get it out of your systems, and then each person has their own little personal problem which is touched upon through out the film although probably not dealt with on the seriousness or depth that reality would require. What about Twin Town.... set in Wales and based around drugs? So does that mean that Human Traffic copied Twin Town which copied Trainspotting?People have slagged off the whole Star Wars bit... er... do you know what sort of crap you rabble on about after an night of pilling your nads off followed by a heavy smoking session with the verge of a comedown starting to give you the good news, it`s funny...You need to have some idea about the Welsh I think to get everything from this film. The cameos, OK everyone knows Carl Cox was in there but the reporter in the club was Nicola Heywood-Thomas, a real reporter for Welsh news. And during the Spliff Politics part we have the man himself Mr Howard Marks, maybe the biggest cannabis dealer Britain has to offer, hailing from Swansea. There are also subtle remarks in the script that you probably wouldn`t notice of if your wern`t Welsh, i.e. on the balcony in the Asylum, the 2 guys meet up with the phrase alright butt how many people thought he said Bud? OK I`m just being picky but I like little touches like that.There are so many phrases from the film that I am sure where thrown into every conversion all over the country after this film. I was in uni when it came out and within days of the film being released quotes were being used left right and centre, Nice One Bruvvaaa!! was always being thrown around the Student Union and halls, I expect that most universities in the country were like this.I have read comments of people saying that the script was crude and had a lot of unessassary swearing. OK these 5 people all come from vairous aspects of the working class back ground. They are not Oxford graduates, they probabally only just get a full set of GCSEs between them. Walk around a pub, a house party, a group of mates getting ready on a friday night, this is how they act and talk, maybe it`s not right for everywhere but it`s spot on for Cardiff.Anyone into the UK club and recreational drug scene in the mid to late 90`s can see them selves here. Anything that happens in this film can and does happen in every town every weekend. The film is there for people like myself who are/were into this scene.There does seem to be a glorification of the drugs in the film with very little of the possible negative aspect of E, coke, wizz etc. but on the other hand, the film isn`t a serious one, it`s not an educational film and it has a 18 certificate, could someone please show me an 18 year old who dosn`t have at least a basic idea of the dangers of drugs, I don`t think that Human Traffic has encouraged anyone to run out the following weekend and take a load of E or snort a couple of lines.Thats it, it`s a bit long and I apologise for any spell/grammar mistakes, but then it is nearly 5AM here....

Pills, thrills, pubs, clubs with the inevitable comedown and ensuing paranoia are all captured and preserved for future generations.The film itself can feel a little disjointed in parts as it lurches from one humorous situation to another, more like an out of control sketch show than a movie but the characters are excellently drawn and some of the moments of fantasy had me rolling on the floor, crying with laughter.

The characters in the movie really do reflect the people you encounter whilst clubbing, and group dynamics are such that groups really do coalesce around people with the same personality traits as those exhibited by the characters in the movie.Clubbers will love it or hate it for being so uncomfortably true to life ( and extremely funny ), whilst non clubbers probably won't have a clue what the nifty camera work is actually doing to people ( but it isn't all a joke, you REALLY do feel that way sometimes... the feeling of paranoia, being strung out, coming down, the euphoria, the talking absolute crap, the naked aggression or the absolute love ... it's all there )I found the old-clubbers-whinging scene particularly painful to watch, as I (before I relearnt tolerance and respect) used to be one of those loud mouthed whingers complaining about the state of clubbing and how it wasn't pure anymore in the mid-late 90s.Worth a watch as a nod and a wink to the culture, or if you want to know more about what it's like to be in the daily/weekly grind of the drugs-as-hedonism scene, when things are going good, and nobody's dying.

In some cases, the similarities are uncanny ;)Human Traffic is mostly an upper.  Apart from the kitchen come-down scene, there's very little punishment for our band of clubbers.  I really liked that.  It doesn't try to moralise.  It doesn't demonise the characters for committing the heinous sin of enjoying recreational drugs.  So many movies attempt to provide a message.  Human Traffic lets you make your own mind up. Power to the audience.I've read a few of the user comments on IMDB quite purposefully in fact. The first thing that I thought after watching it was Great movie, but will Americans get it?.  I'm glad to see that some of our American cousins do indeed get it, but I'm not sure that it ever filled multiplexes in the Bible Belt.Concentrating on certain aspects, the cutaways are superb.  The what we really would have said scene is superb, as is the old-skool clubber complaints section.  Koop's girlfriend-induced paranoia is finely realised and the alternative national anthem is inspired.Star Wars references are always welcome, and Moof does a great job of abstracting the series until it makes absolutely no sense whatever. There's a lot of this in the film.  People talk complete crap, open their hearts about their worries and basically reflect the behaviour of anyone on MDMA.Couple of minor issues with it.  The film is set in Cardiff, but most of the protagonists aren't even Welsh.  This is explained fairly well in the movie, and Cardiff is the most cosmopolitan city in Wales, but you can't help feeling they chickened out on the male leads to give the movie universal British appeal.Overall, Human Traffic is scarily accurate snapshot of the late 1990s.  It doesn't preach.  It doesn't teach.  It simply reflects.  More than that, it's the only film I've seen which can make you feel wasted when you're in the throes of stark sobriety.

This film has everything, well except for a plot but who cares! Who needs a plot when you can just sit back and relax while warping our fragile little minds on an ecstasy rollercoaster. This is Justin Kerrigans first outing into the world of directing (he actually wrote it also), let's just hope it's not his last.

It's been a while since I saw it (half a year) but I still remember a lot of the scenes, most notably the scene where all the people in the pub sing the God save the queen parody Who is the queen?, as this had the audience applauding wildly. The movie feels like a cross between Go, Trainspotting and Acid House, the soundtrack is tops and the laughter comes in frequent bursts. The film succeeds both as being a vivid portrayal of the British club culture and as a study of the generational border and communicative problems between adults and not-so-adults, in addition to being a madly entertaining movie.

For anyone who's never gone out, gotten completely out of their heads, headed to the wonderful world of a cracked-out afterparty, and still had a great time, then this _might_ seem a little foreign to you. (For all of the straight edge party kids out there, please disregard the out of heads and cracked out comment).I believe that a soundtrack can really make a movie, and each song in this movie (carefully picked by London's radio maestro Pete Tong, I think) brings the intensity of being in a packed party straight at you. Play this movie in surround sound and you'll probably get the effects of being at the club.This movie brought back a lot of memories from my hardcore partying days, but didn't make me feel like a complete loser. Whereas watching either Groove (or even Go) made going to parties the in-thing or like an episode off of MTV. I'm not saying Groove was awful, but it just didn't have Human Traffic's effect of being at the party.There's a certain realness to this movie that just makes me want to go out with my best mates to a party (or rave, if you will) and have an amazing time. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who's tired of the same old candy-coated teenage movies about partying or big-budget blockbusters polluting the theaters.Finally, a movie (to me) that captures the essence of a lifestyle that's been around for a LONG time now.

It's an article of faith that a conversation while on drugs can feel like an epoch-defining moment at the time, but aimless cobblers in the cold light of morning. So it is with `Human Traffic'.  This celebration of UK clubland makes pleasant moving wallpaper getting ready to go out, or at 4 am when you pay off the taxi driver and collapse in front of the video, but fails to engage a non-partisan audience.The film is a tragic case study in why so many UK films never see projection on a cinema screen.  The producers and the various clubland stars who appear are so convinced of their own cool that they feel safe to dispense with hoary notions like plot, character development or a coherent central idea. It's like watching the first ten minutes of another film, sampled and stretched paper thin over ninety minutes. There are vague attempts to connect club culture with the fight against the Criminal Justice Act and its anti-rave laws, but like the unfocused chatter to be found in a chill out room, `Human Traffic' cannot grab hold of one clear, worthwhile thought and present it to the viewer.Excessive use of `Trainspotting' style speeches to camera and magic realism do little to conceal a clumsy, incoherent screenplay. Engaging moments, like dope guru Howard Marks lecturing us on dope smoking etiquette, float by like the random gimmicks they are. The most cringe-worthy moment comes when Jip (John Simm) leads the cast in a rendition of the national anthem. Re-written with patronising &#145;youth' lyrics, the defining statement of late 90s youth culture is how hard it is to be cool. Young or old, the response of any self-respecting audience to such rampant self-absorption will be `So what?'

The story isn't really focussed on one guy in particular, although there is a main character, Jip, who I think is mostly there to tie things together.  Instead, the different members of the groups of friends all have their individualities as part of this group, and it's a great ensemble acting piece.My favorite character was Koop, a guy who works in a record store and is totally jealous of his girlfriend, Nina.  He is so cool - and really hot! - and has the coolest job of them all, even though he too wishes he was something else, like a DJ.Speaking of music - I am going out to get the soundtrack to this film.  It ROCKS!  The music that they picked had the audience rocking to the beat, it was so pumpin!  In Koop's introductory scene, where they show him selling stuff like jungle, gangsta rap and the like to customers who bring new meaning to the word poser, well, let me just say, even if the customers weren't the real thing, the music was.The only thing I really didn't like was the beginning, where they just have everyone talking to the camera.

The skill of Justin Kerrigan lies in his ability to portray a cross section of characters - all united to have fun - without having to attach a moralistic indictment. He approximates the true energy that the scene has to offer. From someone who can relate, Kerrigan presents us with scenes full of immense humour, yet he also imbues his film with a detached cynicism, yet it doesn't linger. He just wants us to have fun in watching the film and he made me feel complicit in the drama. There's no moral message at the end - except an implicit 'up yours' to all detractors of the drug and club culture which drives the youth of today. Fine achievement and wonderful viewing!

As I watched the film I became worried that it glamourised the drug culture, but fortunately it brought everything down to earth with a bump in the end. Drugs have there uses and the film does give some fair points towards that but also it showed the negative side to taking drugs. I enjoyed the banter between the characters, I may be completely wrong but I was under the impression that the director somewhat over exaggerated these scenes as it made very funny viewing. No story line was ever really required as the film seemed more of an educational documentry on the do's and don'ts of Clubbing it large style. This aspect was definately my favourite thing about the movie as I could associate my expriencences of clubbing over the years with some (not all) of what was depicted in the film.

The first is  a film about the problems faced by todays youth, the way they don't know which way to turn and all of the decisions they have to make. The only relief they have is by having a break at the weekend and having fun, or you can look at the film as a bunch of friends going out at the weekend and have a great time. Which ever way you look at the film you cannot deny that it's a really great film. As I have said above it follows the lives of 5 friends over a weekend as they go out party and generally have a good time. I think what makes the film so good is the fact that most people will be able to see a small part of themselves in each of the characters. This film was classed as another trainspotting when it was first released, it's not in my opinion it much much better.

John Simm (anti-hero of BBC drama, The Lakes) turns in an excellent performance as Yip - the paranoid, temporarily impotent son of a Welsh prostitute mother and a fraudulent jailbird dad. Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington) is a sharp Irish good-time girl and an old time friend of Yip's who, throughout the course of the film, becomes his objet d'amour. Lulu's best mate is Nina who is seeing the insanely jealous wannabe DJ, Koop (Shaun Parkes). The link man is Moff (Danny Dyer), son of a recently-promoted superintendent of police. Moff is the only one of the quintet without a dead-end insult of a job. He sticks to paying for his weekends by peddling pills and thrills to his 'mad for it' friends and acquaintances.The title sequence draws from films such as La Haine where documentary footage is used as an introduction to the life and times of the characters. In this case, violent images of the CJB riots are edited to a sharp house soundtrack. As the track ends abruptly, so does the fast cutting and Kerrigan begins to zero into his characters.This technique of using music and arresting camerawork to move between fantasy and reality is a key feature of the film and engenders much of its humour. Take, for instance, Yip's chat with a colleague at work. As several pairs of jeans topple off the display shelf which he is stacking, Yip has a freak out and starts mouthing about how s*** his job is. Suddenly the shop manager appears behind him and starts lecturing about the duties of a retail trainee. He starts to sodomise Yip in synch with his ridiculous soliloquy. Returning to the jeans rack, we realise that Yip's fantastical imagination has been visualised, illustrating his point hilariously.As we rock through the plot into the club and party scenes, the film gathers momentum with the characters rising sense of excitement. Rolling eyeballs, lolling heads and listless dancing tell us enough about what the characters have 'dropped' without needless images of disproportionate $100 bills being rolled up or bags full of 'pills' being distributed. There is little hard drugs fetishism here. Watching the viewers sweating to the left and right, I reflected that the film was like a drug experience itself - episodic, anxiety-ridden, euphoric and colourful but with a flip side. As Yip says what goes up must come down, and come down they do! Nevertheless, Kerrigan avoids the trap of sermonising about drugs while managing to deal with some unavoidable facts. Weighing up the pros and cons of pill-popping, Nina's 'ecstasy virgin' brother is confronted with the apparition of an austere chemistry professor dressed in a white lab coat. He lectures the young lad on the risks of chemical abuse while Yip sits in the corner pointing out what a great night lies in store. In a typically humorous conclusion, the professor mentions the shrivelling of the penis leading to temporary impotence to which Yip can only look away.As the weekend winds up, the characters are seen dealing with their comedowns. In two fantastic sequences, Moff gets up from a family lunch and asks the assembled company, who the f*** are you anyway?; while in a vicarage dining room elsewhere Lulu relates her evening in paraphrase. Asked if she enjoyed herself, she replies emphatically, Oh, yes which, according to the subtitles, actually means Two pills and 1/2 gram of coke.Human Traffic is on a mission to épater la bourgeoisie. It will provoke extreme reactions from the critics and many of the older generation will see it as disrespectful, myopic eye-candy. For the 'Ecstasy generation' it will become a cult for the confused, symbolising and yet parodying the decadence of pre-millennium chaos.When the final scene blacks and the credits come up to the seminal Primal Scream track 'Come Together', we cannot fail to understand Kerrigan's scarily anarchic/humanist message 'The Weekend has landed!'

There are many moments in that every one can relate to, Like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers.  The characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie.  The situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in, and that is where this film succeeds.  The topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other.  The story to the film is not all that, but that is not a criticism.  This is a film about people.  This is a well written film, with a sound track to die for.  D.J's Pete Tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that I have seen in 1999.

It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver. Albeit, its in a club, its in Wales and its somewhat dated. The film leaves out some of the sketchier elements of club life, but doesn't disassociate from them altogether. It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.At the core of the film, and the best element of Justin Kerrigan's script, is the characters, eccentric, unique yet completely understandable and accessible. This film simple would not work and be infinitely less entertaining were it not for Jip, Koop, Nina, Moff and Lulu. Viewers can deny the political and social implications of the subtext of Human Traffic as a drug film, Trainspotting wannabe, important peg in British youth culture circa 90's, BUT....they can't deny that these are engaging characters.It's frantic, its brutally honest, it's sobering, it's over the top, but its a great comedy. Raves are a complex thing, so are the drugs that are taken at these events, so are the people you will encounter. But from someone who has gone to parties, become jaded and still goes...Human Traffic is the best snapshot that could be taken of the subculture. Just whatever you do, avoid Groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.

Boldly existentialist, with little if any major conflicts. the only real task of the (unfortunately nicknamed) group of young hipsters is to survive the night.  This movie is complete daesin of British youth. While the style recalls Danny Boyle and Guy Ritchie and Bahz Luhrmann and just about any other 'MTV'-style hectic editing, it can be forgiven of its willingness to appeal to youth market trends.  There are some great moments that strike alarmingly true in Human Traffic (such as the various asides and daydreams in which we enter the narrator's true thoughts. How many of us would really just like to shake off that person that we see in public but have absolutely nothing to say to.)Interestingly enough, the night of debauchery and substance abuse results in no overdoses, no arrests, and no social complications....which is usually the case in real life. And we're presented with the sage advice of the late great Bill Hicks to guide us down this path (which unlike Hicks' philosophy is not about self-discovery but rather getting really ripped)  Surely not likely to be popular among the Just-say-no and straightedge crowds.  The films has a surreal sense to it, that apart from all the fun and intentional surrealness (such as the play-by-play of a kid trying to snag a toke off the joint going around), actually does quite a good job of simulating a high. Though the ending lacks a certain closure (how do you end a movie like this), the enthusiasm levels arefar to hyperactive to be realistic and the style often impedes into the subject matter, Human Traffic is a good weekday movie for those dreaming of the weekend and a good motivational tape for those who've never tried ecstasy.

Twin Town tried to make Wales cool, but this is a far better effort. What I would say though which does concern me slightly is that it shows drug taking in a good light and doesn't show the fact that lives can be destroyed by them as well. It does kind of promote the use of ecstasy, while begrudgingly fleeting over some side effects in a kind of fantasy scene, told by a boring professor type, and being righted by the main character, a clubber.It has kicking music throughout though, and characters that youths can relate too (not just drug takers either) and a good story. It follows a group of 6 youths on a night out on the Cardiff club scene and the events that follow. Never been to the capital myself but hear that is a wicked night out and this re-enforces that.

Most ex-film students will be rubbing their eyes at this unlikely scenario but we have to take his word for it. Tutors encouraging their pupils to make films, whatever next? My tortoise for prime minister? And about CLUBS and DRUGS, not kitchen sink misery. The tide is surely changing in Blighty at last. Actually, the usual tutor reaction of superiority, pomposity and indifference (I am a failed film maker routine) would have been handy here. So what are the kids into nowadays? Well, of what I saw of this film, they basically jump up and down frenetically yelling at each other that the weekend is an amazing thing and that life is bright, colourful and completely positive. Hang on, we're talking Cardiff here. Is it possible to jump up and down while seated in a car? Apparently. By the time our hero was yelling into his mobile phone to his mate on the toilet with a freneticism that makes Roger rabbit look like a depressive, I'd had enough. The desperation behind this film is something else. Apparently the director Kerrigan was semi-happy with the result. He said he got the theme of sexual insecurity across to the audience. Yes, I noticed the Mr.Floppy t-shirt, it was a subtle moment.This film made 3m in the UK which for a no-budget feature is astonishing. So the message is 'just say YES, kids!' Personally, I think the little whipper snappers should be punished for their AFFRONTARY in making films like this. They should have their pants taken down and given a good spanking. This should be video'd and shown to other film makers as a warning, and I will keep the video in my private collection so as to show any young people that may come my way *TREMBLE*.

The plot is the various misadventures of the participants of this party posse within the context that the #1 job is to dance your ass off at the club this weekend and melt so hard on X you can't remember how much the week sucked. Everything between that is just a detail or a drama.The direction in this movie is superb, it has great pacing and shots of clubs, fun scenes and it also does a large number of scenes where we suspend reality and show a lot of really funny metaphor in a bunch of what if? scenarios.
