[{"Title":"Good Film, but too politically correct","Date":"5 December 2003","Score":"23 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Let's be clear on this one, this is a good film to watch. Picture quality is more than adequate and the characters are very well developed. The first prize has to go to the boy Isaiah himself who really was cute, no other word to describe him. The story is well executed and of course does not fail to raise emotion. What I query in the film is its political correctness. Any normal person would expect the boy to remain with his adoptive mother, as his biological mother had left him for, and even considered him, to be dead. That his biological mother, on finding out he's alive, tries to reclaim him seems normal. What is not normal, however, is that the courts give any creedence to the idea that he should be given back to her, as it is implied, on the sole grounds that he has the same colour skin as her !!! The rubbish spoken by her lawyer to the effect that black babies should be with black mothers should have been shown to be the rubbish it is, but it seems to come across as being the only argument that influenced the court's decision as, no other factor seems to have warranted the baby being returned to its biological mother. I am sure that if the roles and been reversed and that it was a white baby abandoned in a trash can adopted by a black family, the courts would have left it with its adoptive family on the basis that skin colour had no importance, only the love of a stable family. This last hypothesis is, in my opinion, the just one, but it should be applied in all cases, whatever the colour of the baby and whatever the colour of the family. One get's the impression the director wants to be good to the blacks at all costs even when the well-being of the child in this case would dictate otherwise and I call this being a victim of political correctness. Of course, the ending is diluted and we see Khaila calling back Jessica Lange to look after the child when she realises that she can't cope. Her behaviour throughout the film is quite plausible and quite understandeable. What is not, it the behaviour of her attorney and the courts. I am not an American but one of the great things about that country is the mixture of origins which has gone to forge it - people of all colours and races but all American. Once you go down the line of wanting to make a black child have a black doll, read obligatorily books about black characters, have black parents etc etc, you are starting down the same path as the Ku Klux Klan many years ago and it's not better but more of the same. To get back to the film, though, I would highly recommend it but would warn viewers of its failing as described above.

Maybe it's because I'm from Canada where I don't believe that racial issues play as important a part as in the United States(of course racist attitudes exist in Canada), but I was completely astonished that the colour of someone's skin was the deciding factor of where a child belongs - that's completely unrealistic to me and that was the ONLY point the biological mother's lawyer made.  Give me a break!  As a mother, I understand that the only reason you have a child is to give life to that child for it to be happy and your ownership never plays a feeling moment because when you really love and care for a child, you're ultimate feeling is for that child to be happy and you, as the loving mother, always comes second - that child comes first! This particular movie explained the baby to be thrown in the garbage and that fact was never brought out in court.  It's not about race/money - this movie was unrealistic and for those who think the biological mother was right -- ask yourself if you're thinking of the child or a selfish adult who cannot grow up and admit a mistake and try and make it better by considering the child's feelings at this point.  Wouldn't it be better if the biological mother introduced herself slowly into the child's life and not turned his world upside down at an age where he only looks for security???  And, the biological mother never once thanked the adopted mom for saving her baby's life and taking care of him.  Again, I found this movie unrealistic and disturbing that the torment of a child would be allowed, especially by someone who says they love them - that's not love, that's selfishness!As for the ending -- the biological mother shouldn't have won, period. ---imagine, the poor kid never would have went through the torment. -- a mother even gradually brings their child to daycare before they leave their child for just a couple hours!

I happen to baby-sit such a family and watched the movie with the kids' mother.  I don't know how she sat through it without throwing something at the screen-not that this is necessarily a criticism.  This film is very thought-provoking, though I think for the wrong reasons.  The main focus is all about color and whether people should raise children of different races.  Jessica Lange's character had a small speech in the courtroom about how love makes a family more than race, but it was just glossed over and the focus of the film went right back to race defining families.  Maybe I just see this differently because of my close association with a family where the parents and one child are white and the other child is not, but family is not about race-corny as this may sound, it really is about love and support.  The ending, as some other reviewers have said, is very wishy-washy.  My viewing companion and her husband, who joined us at the end, liked it because they want to have a good relationship with their daughter's birth mother.  I agree with them on that, but if the movie is going to deal with legalities so much, it should resolve those legalities at the end of the movie.

A child always belongs with a family that loves him- it shouldn't be about color, or wealth or any other irrelevant factors. It's about responsibility and love. Any one can have a baby, not everyone can be a parent. There are certainly some stereotypes and the movie goes to the extreme point of a mother who literally throws away her baby to a family that is white, wealthy and kind to the child. The movie does this for dramatic purposes and succeeds in provoking a response from the many viewers who have seen this movie, as reviews will show. The movie also manages to enrage without even engaging the color issues. When Khaila's character tells her lawyer, but I'm his mother and insists on her parental rights it isn't even about color but about what is important about being a mother. Her character thinks that giving birth gives her rights over this tiny human being, (well played by Marc) when even children should be viewed as human beings with rights themselves. Parents who view children as possesions are wrong. I am white my husband is Mexican- does our child belong with one or the other? Khaila's lawyer says, black babies belong with black mothers. Is that what we want to teach? Segregation? Doesn't work for me. Babies of any color belong with the people who take care of them and love them. That's what being a parent is.

Jessica Lang gives a strong performance as the social worker who dotes on Isaiah to the point that she almost forgets her own daughter.

Halle Berry plays a crack addict who, one night desperate to get high, leaves her newborn baby in a pile of garbage and when she returns after her mission, finds the baby gone. The baby is rescued and is eventually taken home and raised by a sensitive social worker (Jessica Lange) who decides to raise and adopt the hyper-active, crack-addicted baby as her own. In the meantime, Berry gets clean, wants her baby back and takes Lange to court to regain custody of her son. This is an involving story that provides a balanced account of an emotional issue and if you're really paying attention, you will find your alliance with the protagonists in this story switching from time to time. Lange is solid, as always, and Halle Berry works hard at being convincing as a reformed junkie. Strong support is provided by Samuel L. Jackson and LaWanda Richardson (the real-life spouse of Jackson)as Lange and Berry's attorneys, David Straithern as Lang'es husband, and Daisy Prince as Lange's daughter. No matter how hard you try to remain neutral, this film will suck you in and find you taking sides.

Where does it leave me? More scared than ever that something could happen and my children could be removed. I am a firm believer that logic and reason have little to do with family court decisions.The ending is interesting. My heart kept saying to Jessica Lange, don't go, it'll only cause pain. On the other hand I would do anything for my sons, even if it meant me being in pain... so perhaps I would do the same as her and go.What really bothers me is Halle Berry's motivation, it seems to be pure selfishness on her part to disrupt a family, 4 years after Isaiah's placement. I can understand her desire to be part of his life, I am sure the mothers of both my sons think of them on occasion and I hope they are secure in the knowledge that their children are being raised as lovingly as is possible. So, would a mom do what she did? Perhaps, but I have to ask is it out of love or some sense of pride!

Maybe if she found a job good enough to support a child before taking the case to court I would've rooted for her more. In real life a woman like Khaila can't compete with parents like the Lewins. The only thing I saw wrong with the Lewins was that they didn't read to him multicultural books or showed him any real pictures of people of different skin color so he could learn more about himself.

The ending was not only unrealistic it was almost implausible.I was quite young when I first saw this and at the time I was glad it ended as it did because the movie was heartbreaking enough so being young I WANTED a nice cut and dried Hollywood ending.But now being all grown up and seeing the agony real people go through in this situation I'm not sure the ending was as good as I thought then. Of coarse it would be really REALLY difficult for the writers to end it any other way and thus appear to take sides. So they chose to play it safe. I think the movie would, however have been taken more seriously had it maybe been done a little differently though of coarse that would have come with it's own set of problems.Maybe Losing Isaiah was a movie that was just to ahead of its time.

I found it very satisfying and the only one that has a chance of working for this situation.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW  Biological mother Halle Berry makes a very intelligent decision when she enlists the help of Jessica Lange (as the boy's foster mother) in raising the child.  It was monstrous to simply wrench the 4 year old boy out of the only home he's ever known and plunk him down in a totally alien environment.  No wonder he totally shuts down and withdraws.  I believe that what the two women do is something that should be tried in more cases of this type.  The judge should have given them joint custody, allowing the child to be kept with the foster mother, but also allowing the biological mother visitation rights, perhaps babysitting him and taking care of him while the other mother is busy.  This would give the child an opportunity to get to know his real mother and vice versa, since the boy is a stranger to her as well.  As he grows older, he will probably become more curious about his racial heritage, and may eventually grow as close to his real mother as he was to his foster mother in the beginning.  At any rate, this is a strong, compelling drama, beautifully acted all around.

This baby is adopted by a white social worker, played by Jessica Lange. Years later, Khalia attempts to regain custody of her child. A court case ensues.The situation presented in Losing Isaiah is a bit of an anomaly; birth mothers typically only have a 30 day window to reclaim children put up for adoption. In Losing Isaiah, though, Khalia never consents to have her child adopted, creating a legal loophole.Nevertheless, Raising Isaiah does ask somewhat interesting questions should children like Isaiah be returned to their birth mothers, or should they be left with middle-class white mothers? What is in the child's best interest? What are the racial implications of these matters? What is legal? What is moral? Losing Isaiah is too superficial to meaningfully wrestle with these questions, though it does eventually settle upon a solution that demonstrates a certain type of wisdom. Here both mothers, white and black, join forces in the interests of their child; neither has a monopoly on love. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars as a hilariously disgruntled lawyer.7/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

But after seeing the film, I may have to change my mind because on the whole, it is a very powerful and impacting film about child custody and the best interests of the child. The film would have been so much better, expect the film didn't have an ending at all. I did not like the ending and that took down my rating a notch or two. But film will strongly affect everyone, especially those who tend to be politically correct.Stephen Gyllenhaal's film is about a custody battle over an abandoned kid between two women. One woman is a former black crack addict who is now sober and leading a better life, but not after abandoning her kid in a drug haze. The other woman is a white social services worker who has a well-off family and a nice place to live. Now the crack addict named Khaila decides to sue to get her child back.This film is strongly acted. Jessica Lange gives a hell of a performance as Margaret Lewin, who shows unconditional love to the boy. Halle Berry also delivers a potent performance as Khaila, the grieving mother who also truly cares for her son. Samuel L. Jackson makes a good appearance as Khaila's lawyer and David Strathairn was decent as Margaret's wife.Overall, Losing Isaiah is a great movie but it could have been more if it wasn't for that horrid ending that left me with even more questions. But there is no denying the emotion the film provokes and the sympathy that is created for each woman. Each of them has their faults, but both of them truly care for the kid which makes this custody case even more heart-wrenching. I wasn't even able to choose a side. But this is a great film and I'm surprised I haven't heard of it until now. With a better ending, the film would have been perfect. I rate this film 8/10.

Baby Isaiah is rushed to the hospital where Dr. Margaret Lewin administers treatment. She discovers Isaiah is a crack baby, meaning his mother was high on crack when she was pregnant so some of it got into the baby's system; Khalia came to in the morning and went back for Isaiah, only to find him missing; Back at the hospital, Margaret took special care of Isaiah and even took it upon herself to adopt him and take him home to meet her family, husband Charlie and teenage daughter Hannah. The family was Caucasian and Isaiah was African American, but as long as there was love, it made no difference. Khalia meanwhile, still baked, knocked off a liquor store and was incarcerated and sent to a woman's correctional facility.Four years went by, Isaiah was a happy, high-spirited 4-year-old boy. He went to see Hannah's school play and, for no particular reason, threw a huge tantrum, really humiliating his sister; Khalia was released, she quit crack cold turkey, and working steady.

Khalia finds the family's address and stalks them, trying to find Isaiah. The next step litigation. She hires a lawyer, Kadar Lewis, because even though the Lewins' adoption of Isaiah was finalized, Khalia never sighed away her parental rights so she was entitled to a hearing. That's our great country's judicial system, even trashy junkies have rights. Charlie and Margaret also hire a lawyer, preferably an African American one; Lewis set up housing for Khalia in a run-down old dump on the west end of town.

Apparently he didn't feel the Lewins were a fit family for a young African American child.The hearing pressed on and on, both sides delivered good arguments. Margaret points out that all they've been focusing on is skin color and not on what is most important for Isaiah love. Well, soon came the day of judgment. Both sides held their collective breaths as Judge Silbowitz took the bench and announced her verdict...Isaiah would be returned to his birth mother. Well, Margaret and Charlie were devastated. But it was worse for the child, for they had to tear a kicking, screaming Isaiah from the only family he's ever known and give him back to his biological mother who he's never even met. Well, needless to say Isaiah was miserable in his new home. Khalia tried her best to be a good mother and run a suitable home, but Isaiah totally tuned her out. He threw a screaming fit in public on several occasions. Meanwhile Charlie and Margaret were at their wits' end with each other. It was a desperate time for everybody, until one afternoon when Khalia called Margaret for help. They work out an arrangement that would be beneficial for everybody Isaiah would be going to live with the Lewins for a while until he was old enough to understand this whole mess. So it was really a happy ending. For some.Well, Losing Isaiah, what can I say? It's a good movie. It's acted really well, but it's just a bad story, in terms of conscience. Making a movie about a crack-addict mother who abandons her baby then suddenly wants him back and thank to a biased judge, gets him back. I was on the Lewins' side the whole time. I'm not racist, but I do think that sometimes people just focus on skin color much too often. No wonder we still have fights about racial inequality. Anyway, Jessica Lange was good as Margaret Lewin, Halle Berry played a really good trashy crack addict, were we supposed to feel sorry for Khalia at any point in this movie? Because I sure didn't. Cuba Gooding Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, David Strathairn and Daisy Egan were also good in their roles. Marc John Jeffries was the cutest kid; Anyway, if you're in to deep, powerful dramas like this movie or you happen to like Halle Berry or Jessica Lange, then to you I recommend Losing Isaiah. It's not for everybody, however. If your stomach can handle it, see Losing Isaiah today!

Each of the main movie characters present emotions and attitudes from their very own angle. The fight for the baby includes court trials which are emotionally very exhausting for the both sides. This part of the movie talks pretty much about racial stereoptypes, hate flame, prejudices, disrespect, and about a fact, that what we name 'correctness' may sometimes mean 'right' and sometimes 'wrong' thing. I think this part was little bit overexaggarated but it 'helped' to bring more drama to the movie.It was a very strong movie, describing love of people to others, and through all the political/race related issues, it's a beautiful story.

We aren't. Like the mother in this movie, we are hurt by the loss of our children just like any other mother would be. The movie was obviously kinder to the adopter, but not all adopters are so rich and so loving. I think this movie helps reinforce stereotypes about adoption, adopters, and the mothers of adopted children.However, maybe the movie is only concerned with African American babies being separated from their mothers or being raised without their cultural identity. Maybe the movie is not at all concerned with white adoptee babies and their identity problems, but it does give credence to the idea that mothers and children should not be permanently separated.

I hated the way Samuel L. Jackson's character kept going on and on about being a color to raising another color and the way he said it, it sounded like he was wrong! I'm not mentioning colors but I hated how himself and Halle Berry ' s character kept ranting on about it! Very tense I swear!

It's very stressful for a child to get back to reality and that, he was so attached to his adoptive parents!

Margolis, the film sees baby Isaiah being abandoned by his drug addict black mother Khaila Richards in a bin shortly after his birth. He is found and taken to hospital where Margaret Lewin, a white doctor caring for him, decides to adopts him as her own child. Isaiah fits well into the Lewin family despite hailing from a different racial background and he grows into a happy, cherished little boy. But four years later, Khaila is back on the scene demanding custody of her son back now that she is clean. And it seems the Lewins' have a fight on their hands to keep the child since the family court system not only favours children being returned to their parents but also the idea of people only being allowed to foster/adopt children of the same racial background as themselves.The quality of acting was excellent from all members of the cast. Jessica Lange gave a great depiction as Margaret Lewin, the mother who doted on Isaiah with as much love as if she had given birth to him herself. Although, on the surface, it was quite hard to like Khaila Richards, Halle Berry gave the role substance and managed to make her an almost sympathetic character as the film went on. However, the real praise has to be reserved for the tiny Marc John Jefferies, who played Isaiah. Anyone who has ever said small children can't act or tried to excuse mediocre child acting on the basis of the child's age needs to see this boy's first-class performance despite the fact he must barely have been out of nappies when he appeared in this film.Reading other people's reviews, it's clear some people don't realise that social services will push to place a child back with their biological family even in a situation like this. No, I don't think it's right as there are many cases where the best place to ensure a child's well-being and happiness is to be far, far away from their parents but, sadly, that doesn't often happen. And race does still play a role in where a child up for fostering/adoption is placed. So, for me, I found this film quite realistic in that respect and could completely empathise with the Lewin family's sense of helpless and disbelief as they risked losing their son to a mother who dumped him purely on the basis of they had the wrong skin colour and DNA. 'Losing Isaiah' certainly shows that a child's sense of security and love must always come first, regardless of what the biological mother wants or whether his skin tone matches his adoptive parents.The ending, unfortunately, was rather a cop-out. It delivered a typical Hollywood 'happily ever after' with political correctness probably at the forefront of the scriptwriter's mind bu, in terms of reality, with both mothers' agreed to share custody with the child remaining at his adoptive parents' home but going to a nursery school of Khaila's choice with her accompanying him, viewers were left annoyed the issues raised in the film were not properly addressed. Perhaps a better resolution would have been to see Khaila forced to give up custody (or agreeing to let him go for the sake of her son's happiness since she seemed to see more sense than the so-called judges, lawyers and social workers) then re-entering Isaiah's life when he was older.

It had a star-studded cast of very talented actors and actresses and a controversial premise that could have proved intriguing and thought provoking. It's such a shame then that this movie is undermined by weak plot development, poor character development and a sloppy script To be fair, this movie isn't terrible but I think that's mostly due to the excellent casting in this movie rather than anything else. Jessica Lange gives great depth and dimension to her role and allows the viewer to feel great sympathy, understanding and compassion for her character and its predicament. Samuel L Jackson also gives quite a lot of depth to his role Mark John Jeffries is amazing in his portrayal of Isaiah -great talent for one so young -and Daisy Eagan's performance as Jessica Lange's daughter is also wonderful. This is not Halle Berry's best performance but in all fairness, I don't think this is totally her fault for reasons I'll mention below The character development is woeful. Both Halle Berry and Samuel L Jackson in particular are essentially reduced to stock characters with the latter in particular reduced to spouting out tired old clichés about race and racial stereotypes that are tedious and almost painful to watch. In the hands of more talented production/script team, these issues could probably have been discussed and explored much more effectively but here they just sound weak and annoying. Halle Berry's character is equally as badly sketched and the writers fail to give it the depth and the substance (or the dialogue or emotion) that would allow the audience to feel greater sympathy or empathy for her and her predicament.Finally there's the plot development. Although the writers/producers do a good job exploring the circumstances behind the adoption of Isaiah by the Lewin family and illustrating how he has become an integral part of the family, they drop the ball as soon as they introduce the sequence of events where Halle Berry's character wants custody back of her baby. In particular the courtroom drama relating to Halle Berry's desire to have her son back was ultimately weak and deeply flawed -failing to explore the issues properly beyond a bunch of tired of clichés -and this meant that the court's ultimate judgment was unsatisfying and difficult to comprehend by the audience. To be fair, the ending to the movie wasn't totally awful but probably was a too cute effort to try and wrap everything up and tie up the loose ends and forge some attempt at consensus -probably unrealistic in real life.Losing Isaiah is still a watchable movie despite all these flaws but it's just incredibly frustrating to see all the potential of a great cast and a great plot potential squandered. If you read Jessica Lange's comments about this movie in the trivia section, it probably sums up accurately this movie and all that is wrong with it "},{"Title":"Completely Unrealistic","Date":"14 February 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I find it interesting that so many reviewers mistakingly describe the Lang character as the foster parent-she actually adopts him years before the birth mom returns for him. From a legal/social work perspective, this movie is in outer space. Which may be great for melodrama, but does a disservice to the thousand of children in this country who are available for adoption and languishing in foster care. The film is irresponsible, because it reinforces common misperceptions about adoption and encourages the deepest fears of those who might consider adopting. Every state has a statute of limitations for appealing termination of parental rights prior to adoption. Birth parents cannot return to the scene years after an adoption has been finalized to contest the validity of the termination of their parental rights. The race-based position of the bio mom's lawyer, whatever its merits from a moral perspective, would never make it into court. There is federal law against this. As other reviewers have noted, foster parenting is a different story and there is typically a strong push in favor of reunification with the biological parent before rights are terminated.

This is the perplexing question raised in Stephen Gyllengaal's tragic Losing Isaiah, the story of the desperate custody battle between the white adoptive parents and the black biological mother of little four year old Isaiah. Khaila Richards has discovered that the baby she left in a cardboard box is still alive and lays claim to him, stating that he should not be raised by parents of a differing colour. Margaret and Charles Lewin will not concede without a fight though, and they enlist an African-American attorney to represent their cause.Director Gyllenhaal fails (incredibly) to generate compassion for any of the characters involved, not even Isaiah! Naomi Foner's screenplay (from Seth Margolis' novel) has unfortunately underdeveloped its pivotal players, and thus we are unable to associate with them and get under their skin. The characters of Khaila and Charles Lewin are particularly overlooked.Here we have a film that presents a shocking and challenging topic without (somehow) shocking or challenging us. Failing almost entirely to invoke the emotions, I was no more inspired than having read the story in the newspaper. Marc John Jefferies is cute, yet Gyllenhaal barely even plays on this, amazingly.Both Director and screenwriter have skimmed over the top of all the sensitive issues and shirked all the antagonistic problems that Losing Isaiah raises. They never stir deeply enough nor give the movie a harsh enough edge. The soft ending is a major disappointment too, when this picture desperately needed a hard-hitting finale to drive home a point, one Mr. Gyllenhaal's film never had to make in the first place.Racial issues throughout are intriguing yet sadly never fully examined. Should black and white mix when it comes to raising children? Can white folks raise an African-American child satisfactorily, so that he has a full understanding of who he is, his heritage, and so that he's sure of his position in society and is able to form and maintain stable relationships? Then again, is an ex-crack addict who threw her new born baby out with the trash fit to be a mother? The ultimate question is of course, what's best for Isaiah? With all this in mind, the whole movie just did not have the impact it required and will leave you untouched.All the acting is of a good standard, though never to the height it could have been. Both David Strathairn and Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction) are hard pressed to do anything with their limited roles, Halle Berry shows she's on the rise with a convincing portrayal of Khaila, while Jessica Lange is strong but she's been infinitely better. In fact the most disappointing thing about Ms. Lange's showing was her appearance! She looked dreadful, as if she hadn't slept in days, and her hair was awful.
