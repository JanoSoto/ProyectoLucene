She really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer programmer, often difficult to do. I can say this because I happen to be a computer programmer.Anyway, I thought the basic plot was a very good one. You can easily build sub-plots upon its mainframe and turn it into a very enjoyable movie. The premise is also scarily realistic in that this can all really happen if the right precauctions aren't taken.To make a long review short...oops! Too late!

Today it's clich√©.","Date":"25 July 2004","Score":"34 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Odd the way technology works. Less than a decade ago, there was this completely different technological world, a world of pagers, floppy disks, dial-up modems (which are as obsolete as typewriters), and gigantic brick-like cell phones. I remember being amazed at that little tiny flap at the bottom of the phone, as thin as a credit card and yet able to pick up your voice and transmit it through the air. Now it's a feature so obsolete that it may as well never have been there. Sandra Bullock plays Angela Bennett, a lonely computer analyst who is so connected to her computer that she sits on the beach in Mexico, on her first vacation in six years, with her laptop on her lap. It's not only like a source of nourishment but her connection to the world and the establishment and maintenance of her identity.This is where her problems begin. Like The Manchurian Candidate back in the 1960s (and again in less than a week from this writing), The Net plays on the popular fears of the society in which it is released. The Manchurian Candidate originally played off the fears instilled in people by the recently ended Cold War, while The Net, a much less potent thriller, suggests the scary possibilities of a world in which we are so inextricably connected to computers. Probably the most interesting thing in the movie now is the computers, such as the massive laptops with the tiny screens, the indispensable floppy disks which are now almost nonexistent, the graphics, etc.Angela Bennett has had her digital identity stolen and replaced with that of Ruth Marx, who has a lengthy police record and who thus takes over Angela's identity. It's pretty clever, I suppose, the way the movie presents Angela as though she hasn't left her apartment in six years and with a mother suffering from Alzheimer's (and thus not able to help identify the real Angela later), but it's pretty hard to believe that not a single person in the office where she worked noticed that Angela started being a completely different person. She had no significant other, was not dating, and no parents who could identify her, but was she such a recluse that even the people in the office she worked in didn't even know what she looked like?At any rate, the plot of the movie is pretty smartly created, although it is created as though it were an excuse for a lot of chase scenes, one of which takes place on a merry-go-round in a great homage to Hitchcock's Strangers On A Train, one of the many classic films to which the movie alludes, several of them other Hitchcock films. Bennett has been given a disk which contains a website, I suppose, which turns out to contain a weakness in a security system about to be set up to protect everything from banks to Wall Street to the CIA. By holding down Control and Shift and clicking on the little Pi icon in the corner of the screen, you are transported from a ludicrous page about Mozart's Ghost, apparently a god-awful metal band, and into highly classified government documents. The disk provides the bad guys with a reason to want to capture Bennett, and thus you have a movie.Angela goes from a comfortable but bored computer analyst, doing a lot of her work from home and ordering pizza on the Internet at the end of the day (presumably one of the future possibilities of the internet which never came to exist), to a wanted fugitive, ultimately caught and put into a jail cell for someone else's crimes. She has lost her home, her job, her identity, her life. Bullock actually puts in a pretty good performance in the movie. I'm not a huge fan, but I appreciated the realness that her character had, since she is not an over the top actor, her characters are generally very real because she is as well. Where the movie trips up is that it tries to suggest that such identity theft could happen to anyone in our technological age, but given the effort put into presenting Angela as someone with no personal contacts with just about anyone, really it could only happen to someone like Angela, and are there really that many people that no one can identify by looks? Even the guy at the local video store might recognize her as the lady who rents under her account. Oh well. There's also a glitch in the end of the movie that Mick LaSalle points out and that only people familiar with San Francisco, where the climax of the film takes place, will notice. As Angela rushes through a Macintosh exhibition at the real Moscone Center, she desperately tries to copy all the computer files before the bad guys get her. Pretty tense, but if she had been smart, she could have gone to The San Francisco Chronicle office, which is a block down the street from the Moscone Center.But hey, maybe the Chronicle doesn't have high enough walkways out back.

Thankfully, it does attempt to bring some raw suspense that is head-and-shoulders above other lame films that contend to artificial communication. Once again, Sandra Bullock knows how to keep her fans happy, and even though it's no chick-flick, she's still the likeable character inside. This time, she's stalked in a game of cat-and-mouse and becomes ruined by an identity crisis. Even with the brand new concept of cyberware, that's just normal for a suspense thriller. An old, traditional chase plot gives the movie a blip on the screen, but the story is greatly paced and exciting enough to increase your pulse rate to rapid highs.

I was thinking it would be a no-brainer stupid little thriller starring Sandra Bullock. Essentially... I was right.THE NET had the potential to be a better film. The storyline actually creates situations of immense suspense and is paced rather well. The whole computer virus storyline is so confusing to someone not too familiar with computers... and I'm sure there are plot holes in there, but I didn't notice.What keeps THE NET from being truly good is terrible direction. Lately, I've started to notice how easily a bad director can destroy a film and this was a good example... certain moments in this film are just comically bad.The scene of Sandra Bullock's boat get away and her impending crash looks terrible. And normally I can forgive obvious special effects... but I'm sorry, the obviously fake rocks, the poorly edited stunt woman, the ridiculous close ups on Bullock's face. This moment is so terrible and just acts like a giant speed bump in the growing action.Aside from this, Jeremy Northam is god awful in his role. He goes so far over the top trying to be this seductive threat in Bullock's life that I was laughing many times when I wasn't supposed to be. The more threatening, angry, and sexual he tries to get... the less frightening he becomes. Not an ounce of nuance or subtlety. Where was a director telling him to hold back? Or just to tell him... get off my set... you suck! Otherwise, the director, Irwin Winkler, takes far too long at times when he doesn't need to. I liked the Dennis Miller/Sandra Bullock love story that started to develop. But in the end, the scenes are pointless and they come to an abrupt end. And anytime Sandra Bullock was on the run, Irwin Winkler just keeps the camera rolling. There is no example of tightly constructed... suspenseful editing.On the plus side, despite the flaws, the movie still can be exciting at points... and Bullock has some good moments that show some deeper potential. Had this film been done by a director with a keener eye, perhaps both Bullock and the film could have been much better.As is, it's the kind of film that's easy to sit through... but that's partially b/c it's so bad it's good. It's not the worst film that ever was, but it could have been far better.... C/C- ...

Seven years hence...I realize that many of the governmental entities supposedly hacked were, at the time of this movie, utilizing systems built when leisure suits were still the rage--and IBM was lord and master of the computer domain. Granted, hackers can be considered a real and acknowledged threat, but we should take this movie for what it is...Just some passably good entertainment and not too representative of R/T (Real Time for all you Netsurfing newbies). However, the plot remains fundamentally sound, and not too taxing on the mind. Sandra Bullock gave a reasonably credible performance as programmer/support tech/consultant Angela Bennett. I realize that sex appeal fuels Hollywood, and it IS possible to have beauty and brains. But the story seems to have some fundamental flaws. What are the odds that NO one would know who you really were...It's impossible to think that we really have become the so-called ghosts in the machine. As long as we have receipts, hard copies,friends and loved ones, we won't be caught in The Net. Some good performances by the smooth but irreverent Dennis Miller, and by the suave but deadly Jeremy Northam make for a movie worth watching when there's nothing better on the boob tube...Or if you're a closet geek like yours truly, you call friends and laugh about all the inaccuracies.

Alongside the excitement, however, many anxieties were expressed about the potential dangers involved and many of these feature in this movie which presents the kind of nightmare scenario that many people feared. Identity theft, a breakdown of social interaction and cyber-terrorism were all recognised threats and are used to good effect in The Net to create a fast-moving thriller that was very topical at the time of its release but now inevitably looks dated.Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) is a computer analyst who works at her home in Venice, California where she identifies and eliminates viruses in programs that are sent to her by San Francisco software company, Cathedral Systems. When one of her colleagues sends her a program that makes it easy to access and modify data held by government departments, airports, hospitals and banks etc, she's told that he'll soon be travelling down to her home to work with her on the program. Shortly after, he's killed in a plane crash and so she continues with her original plan to go on vacation to Mexico and takes her laptop and a disk containing the new program that she'd been asked to work on.In Mexico, she meets a smooth-talking man called Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who seduces her but is really only interested in stealing her disk and killing her. When this becomes obvious, Angela manages to escape but after returning home, discovers that her house has been put up for sale and her identity has been swapped with a woman called Ruth Marks who's apparently a criminal wanted by the police. It swiftly becomes evident that Angela's being pursued by a group of cyber-terrorists called The Praetorians and the police and can't prove her real identity because she has, for many years, led a reclusive lifestyle in which her only regular face-to-face contact was with her mother who has Alzheimer's disease.The only person that Angela knows who could confirm her identity is her ex-psychiatrist and ex-lover, Dr Alan Champion (Dennis Miller) and although he provides some help, he's soon prevented from getting Angela out of her nightmare and she remains on the run until she eventually confronts Devlin for the final time.There are plenty of chases and well-executed action sequences in The Net and Hitchcockian influences such as , the wrong man (woman) theme, the fairground motif and confused identities as well as a disk that becomes the MacGuffin, add extra interest. The power of the terrorists seems overwhelming and an atmosphere of paranoia prevails when amongst other things, the modification of key computer records result in the deaths of a prominent politician, a hospital patient and a software expert who's piloting a plane.The focus throughout the entire story is on Sandra Bullock's character and her skill in making herself convincingly introverted and work-obsessed plays a huge part in the success of this movie as she outshines everyone else who appears in it.

Back then the net was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web.I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich√©s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well.There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role.I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.

Bullock is an incredible role model as a female hero she is smart, funny, feminine and likable. The main issue for The Net over the years has been the march of time itself. Thrillers require a certain immediacy and immersion, and the mentioning of goofy out of date technological jargon risks dragging you out of the moment. As a period piece, or a time capsule, The Net is perfect, but does it still work as it did for audiences in 1995?Luckily, the Net is not really about technology, its about the nature of identity in a bureaucracy, explored through the lens of technology, with the interweb as a weapon, and those issues are still relatable, and a movie like The Net serves as a good reminder of how trusting we have become of our internet privacy.

A recluse, she does all of her work by modem and telephone, and in her spare time enjoys playing computer games and visiting chat rooms, and when it is time to eat, orders pizzas on- line. Via FedEx, Angela mails to colleague Dale (Ray McKinnon), a friend who has never seen her, at Cathedral's office building a red diskette containing a virus that causes crashes. She specifically warns him not to strike the Escape key while this diskette is inserted into the hard drive. Previously Dale had sent a green diskette that alerts her to a program (Gatekeeper) that propels her into top secret government databases, like the US Federal Reserve. This is accomplished by clicking on the pi (œÄ) logo in the lower right corner of the screen while pressing the Control plus Shift keys. (Dale had created the Mozart's Ghost website that picked up a virus that transported him to Gatekeeper.) The bad guys modify data and raise havoc among government departments, airports, banks, etc. After they hack into agencies' computer systems to create chaos, they offer a solution by selling their security software. But when the damaged party buys this security software, they unknowingly put themselves at risk to those who initially generated the problem! Dale wants to see Angela right away about the glitch, but she explains that she has finally planned her first vacation in six years - to Mexico. He convinces her to see him before her departure, as he can fly to her location the following morning so they can finish business before noon. She agrees and copies the Gatekeeper website's programming code onto a diskette to further research the problem. But before they meet his small airplane strangely crashes (because of skullduggery), killing him instantly. At a Mexican beach with her laptop and diskette, Angela is approached by a slick dude, Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam). They strike up a conversation, which develops into friendship. Devlin, though, is devious. He is actually after the Gatekeeper computer diskette that Angela holds in her purse. Devlin works for the Praetorians, the Gatekeeper syndicate that knows she has it (perhaps they monitored her computer transmissions in chat rooms). After her purse is stolen by a slimy thief hired by Devlin, whom he shoots to death, she escapes Devlin's clutches on a motorized raft. But she crashes into a rock, is knocked out, and ends up in a Mexican hospital. After three days she awakens and discovers her diskette was damaged because of water and sunlight exposure. Returning to her hotel, Angela discovers she had supposedly checked out earlier. As she has no identification, she goes to the American Embassy. There she is compelled to sign Ruth Marx to get a temporary visa. Her identity was stolen by the Praetorians, who have changed her name to one with a criminal record larceny, illegal drug use, parole violations. Marx is wanted by the police. At least Angela can use the money she has from Devlin's wallet.Angela finally arrives at the LA airport to find her car missing. Eventually coming home, she finds it empty and for sale. She seeks help from her former psychiatrist and lover, Alan Champion (Dennis Miller), who checks her into a motel and tries to help her even though he believes her to be somewhat delusional. Because of her cloistered lifestyle, she has almost no interpersonal relationships and cannot prove her identity. Compounding the problem, her own mother (Diane Baker) has Alzheimer's disease so even she cannot identify Angela. Doesn't Angela have any other relatives or neighbors or doctors? Over much of the rest of the film, Angela is involved in a series of narrow escapes, especially from Devlin. There is a credibility problem here, as it is difficult to believe that such a recluse could continually elude a contract killer. But she does, and even escapes from police custody. Meanwhile Alan is chemically murdered in the hospital, leaving Angela alone. Eventually Angela hitch-hikes a ride to Cathedral's San Francisco office building, and uses an unoccupied workstation to smoke out Ruth Marx, the fake Angela. When she sets off the building's fire alarm systems, she learns of Marx's location, which she occupies. (But how did Marx ever position herself there?) Angela works into Cathedral's mainframe and inserts data that protects her true identity and deletes Marx's info. Successful there, Angela then finds the red diskette (virus) she earlier mailed to Dale. She quickly saves the details of the computer scam onto a blue diskette, and, with BOTH diskettes, departs to the advertised Pan Pacific Computer Convention at the Moscone Center. There, on a vacant computer at Cathedral's display booth, she sends the proof (blue diskette) exposing Gatekeeper to the US Department of Justice /FBI. Then she inserts the virus-containing red diskette into the drive as Devlin arrives and pushes her away. Not realizing that the red diskette is inserted, he strikes the Escape key, thinking that he has reversed Angela's work. But his action activates the virus that attacks Gatekeeper's mainframe. Angela escapes from him one final time as both he and Ruth Marx eventually die chasing her. In the end Angela gets Jeff Gregg, the top Praetorian, arrested and recovers her regular life. One needs to suspend his belief system and just enjoy the movie for what it is, as there is much technological impossibility, like clicking on œÄ and getting into the Federal Reserve (!). Also, has anyone been at an airport and read Crashed or Hijacked on digital screens? However, Ms. Bullock's performance is splendid. Don't blame the film on twenty year-old technology small computer screens, wide monitors, dial-up modems, and large cellphones. Twenty years from now what we have will also be obsolete.

Just as she is about to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. Angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela heads to Mexico but takes the disc with her. While she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes overtures to her. She falls for them and the two end up on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. Even after Angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the USA, Jack makes things difficult. He changes Angela's identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. Can Angela, a computer whiz, beat Jack at his own game? This very exciting movie has many assets. First, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. The script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. The costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. And, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as Angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. It delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to net a very good evening of entertainment.

Although an obviously physically-fit young woman, she then proceeds to move through a series of physically-demanding pursuits - sometimes fleeing, sometimes initiating the action - which would tax every resource of Schwarzenneger's or Stallone's stunt doubles.It is largely unbelievable, and some of the computer activities are beyond what even Bill Gates could accomplish (not denying hackers and misdirected computer experts can do a lot today, just not to this all-encompassing extent). Besides, much of the technology presented in the film, and the basis for all the murders and attempted murders, is portrayed in ways either impossible or never done in terms of computer security systems, programming, etc.So what we have is an interesting film, with engaging performances, and one which, after suspending belief, is pretty satisfying. As with the fine Will Smith/Hackman opus, Enemy of the State, just enjoy the two hours or so, forgetting that it could all have been reduced to a 10- or 15-minute documentary had the lead character acted differently at the outset.

Bullock's performance has great weight with the box office. That's what we call Bullock influence, bigger than the film itself. She is low-key and she never overdraws her roles. Maybe that's because she is acting herself. If you are true to yourself, you needn't overcast.This is much a self-independent, self-help story, a predecessor of Flight Plan. These women are really heart breakers because of their braveness in desperation. Helpless, desperate, fragile yet stubborn, they want to survive this jungle-law world. If Weaker or less intelligent, they will be devoured mercilessly. There are heaps of innocent people being wrongly accused movies. Maybe it reflects our tastes. The movie is well-crafted. It covers the affection a daughter has for her mother who's caught senile dementia; deals with tenderness a psychologist shows to his former patient and lover; as well as admiration and hatred an assassin entertains to his target. They were tangled up to make the movie a little bit overloaded. Jeremy Northam is blessed with the role as the assassin who is more complex than we see those in other movies. Bullock's roles are stereotyped, mostly nobody turning to a big hero. She is still likable.

The same happens when Hollywood tries to show us some hi-tech. The outcome of such attempts varies from being very far-fetched and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to being quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)).The Net lies somewhere between those extremes. By nitpicking, one can end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies, and a lot of cases where the ongoings seem to be much more sexy and graphical than the way things are in real life (as usually happens in movies).However, by simply overlooking those, the viewer ends up with a quite solid, entertaining movie. The characters and acting are convincing, and the movie does a good job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it. The plot is okay (a fairly standard one, really -- based on the good ol' paranoiac design, but with a hi-tech edge this time), and quite convincing (again, when disregarding technical issues). The development of the plot is a bit sluggish, though, and occasionally you can anticipate some supposedly surprising turns in the plot.The bonus here is cutie-pie Sandra Bullock, which besides being cute (something she does quite easily, apparently), also portrays a solid act. You can really feel her character -- her despair, her emotions.In the bottom line, the movie is entertaining and interesting, rates about 7 from 10 in my scale. It's worth renting from the video library, or even watching in the cinema. Whether to buy it or not is up to you.

One of the reasons it's so frightening is that it can happen, and it does, in small ways, once in a while. Some evildoer once got hold of my credit card receipt and made two thousand dollars worth of phone calls to Brooklyn. I was more puzzled than angry. Who or what is worth spending two thousand dollars to talk to in Brooklyn? Anyway it took years to straighten it out.The movie is about identity theft too, but in a major way. Sandra Bullock is a computer analyst who accidentally learns of a conspiracy by a software security outfit -- Gatekeeper -- run by a secret organization called the Praetoreans. It's not clear exactly what their goals are. Once installed, their security system allows a back-door entry into any data base, and presumably this will lead to their taking over the world somehow. In the meantime, when the Praetoreans learn that Bullock may know about their plan, they set about erasing her identity on line and dispatch a smooth-talking, handsome, wealthy British dude to delete her existence IRL. When the company substitutes a false on-line ID for her (involving prostitution, VD, first-degree skulking while immersed in giant tubs of cottage cheese, wanted dead or alive, and so on) and knocks off her only friend, the shrink, Dennis Miller, she runs and hitches from city to city but there seems to be no ESC.It's a good thing they picked Sandra Bullock to erase. She's a nerdy recluse who works out of her home. Nobody knows her. Not her landlord -- nobody. No old school chums, no family except a mother who is conveniently institutionalized with Alzheimer's and doesn't recognize her. Her existence is entirely virtual. Anybody else would have left some footprints in the sand, but not Bullock. Not that she LOOKS like a geek. (Debra Winger in Black Widow looked like a geek.) That's just one implausibility. The movie is loaded with them. She's wanted by the police. Her picture is all over the place. And how does she get from LA to San Francisco? She hitch hikes, presumably on 101. Well, she's attractive enough and has a saucy figure, so who knows? The acting is nothing special. The plot is disjointed and zigzags around. The director spares us the techniques we might see on MTV but has a talent that strains for the banal effect. At one point, the English assassin chases Bullock out of a building into the night-time streets of San Francisco, the avenues crowded with a parade of candle-toting demonstrators demanding Health Care. Street demonstrations seem to be offered as the city's equivalent of New Orleans' Mardi Gras or Boston's St. Patty's Day parade.Anyway, Bullock rushes into this silent crowd. Usually under these circumstances the protagonist dons a hood or a funny hat, grabs a candle, and becomes part of the parade. But here the assassin is able to spot Bullock because she is running through the march -- but in the WRONG DIRECTION. Can you imagine what Hitchcock would have done with an opportunity like this? I was unable to follow all the logical twists but managed to get the general picture because the direction and the musical score clued me in when the scene was supposed to be suspenseful, dramatic, romantic, or fulfilling. Lots of cross cutting. I mean LOTS of cross cutting between Bullock trying to pull off a quick stunt and her hunter looking for her in order to terminate her program. Clich√© is piled upon clich√©. A drawbridge is opening but Bullock manages to jump to the other side while her pursuer's car slides to a halt at the brink and the assassin glares at her across the widening gap. Mercy.It didn't matter much. The movie is a minor diversion but not more than that.

We have said computer programmer Angela Bennett (who's online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY!!! I bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other Company's software for errors/glitches etc. So we start with her ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown thus far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file.Any event, we move on. She gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data woohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. This of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps in the ocean off his boat, BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital.Problem #1 You can't create a loophole on the Internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem #2 Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go.Then these 'hackers' or whatever change Angela's ID so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on.Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and don't believe her. So then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe.Then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the FBI. She apparently HAS to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But then the same fool that tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. It brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP! Anyway, the now uber virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He of course has a gun, runs up to her so he's like 2 feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood.All in all this movie is so full of BS and crap.

I suppose one of the problems of making movies that in any way revolve around technology is that technology evolves, and what seems cutting edge can quickly start to seem old fashioned. That's certainly the case with The Net. Sandra Bullock did a passable job as Angela Bennett - a computer analyst of some sort who basically lives on The Net. She works from home; she never interacts with anyone apparently except through computers. The only exception seems to be her mother, but her mother has Alzheimer's and doesn't know who she is. In 1995 the chat rooms and the best pizza in cyberspace and sending electronic mail probably would have seemed cutting edge to a lot of people. Less than 20 years later (and actually long before this) it's just really, really dated technology with rather grainy computer graphics - along with the aforementioned floppy disks and dial up modems. At times it's hard to get around that and settle into this movie.And yet, at the same time, there's a strangely prophetic feel to this as well. I mean, in 1995 somebody made a movie that revolved exclusively around issues of identity theft and cyberterrorism - both very real concerns 20 years later. Not a bad job of gazing into the crystal ball, I'd say.Angela gets caught up in a conspiracy by a group that seems to be trying to crash pretty much every computer system going. I have to admit that the plot came across at times as a bit convoluted. I wasn't entirely clear on the goals of the cyberterrorists; what they were hoping to accomplish. But they certainly did a good job of messing with Angela's life. While on vacation she meets and falls for a mysterious man who's part of the conspiracy. The conspirators then stole her identity and gave it to one of their own; they replaced her identity with that of a woman wanted by the police for a series of felonies. Basically her entire life was wiped out and replaced by a life she knew nothing about and that put her on the run, with nowhere to go for help. That was well done, and pretty smart. Her goal, of course, is to reveal the plot and regain her life.There's some good action; and some rather clich√© chase scenes involved. It stretches the bounds of credibility a bit, I think, by suggesting that there's hardly a person in the entire world who could vouch for who Angela really is. She's honestly had no contact with anyone? She spends every moment of every day in her apartment on a computer? If so, why did she go on vacation in the first place? Clearly she likes getting out. And her mother was in some sort of institution, and Angela clearly visited. Maybe her mother doesn't know her, but wouldn't some staff member of the institution know who she was? And wouldn't the company that sends her the best pizza in cyberspace have to have someone deliver it to her? There must have been someone who had seen her.So, credibility's lacking a little bit, and this does have a bit of a quaint, old-fashioned feel to it. But Bullock is OK, and there's enough excitement in this to keep you watching.

Bullock is a computer analyst/programmer who works from home and gets sent a disk by a friend to look at. This disk causes problems which she has to work out during which she has to go on the run, her identity is erased. Angela Bennett is no more. It's scary stuff, and would have been more so back in the 90s when much of this was fairly new - it's very true that all our personal information is on computer so we all are vulnerable.Sandra plays increasing desperation well, and the story unravels rather than unfolds, and is quite emotional in places - especially those including her mother with Alzeimer's. Jeremy Northam, Brit actor, and rather dishy, plays the antagonist, and plays it well. Being so attractive, his nefarious ways are even worse, and as all her safety is stripped away, he's always there to make her run again. I like that the programming scenes don't have silly graphics (see Hackers) but are clear key/screen clicks and code being typed and this is one of the most realistic of the many hacker films that came out in the 90s.This has aged well, except some of the technology of course, and it's still relevant. It is interesting to see technology changes ie the ease and normalcy of tracing mobile phones now for example.

One day a co-worker sends her a strange program that gives access to a new security program known as Gatekeeper; she agrees to meet him but he is killed when his plane's navigation system fails. She is shocked but thinks it was an accident so goes on her planned holiday to Mexico. Here she meets Jack Devlin; he appears to be the perfect man for her to spend time with as he shares so many of her interests; the problem is he just wants the disc with the program on and is 'perfect' because he has been talking to her on line. When he thinks he has the disc he intends to kill her but she manages to escape. This isn't the end of her troubles though; somebody has changed all computer records relating to her; when she gets home she finds her home is up for sale and her employers now have a new 'Angela Bennett' working in their offices; she is left with the identity 'Ruth Marx'; a wanted criminal. With her identity stolen she turns to the only man she can trust; Alan Champion her former psychiatrist and one time lover. Devlin is still trying to kill her; if she is to survive she is going to have to find out about a sinister group of hackers known as the Praetorians and how they are connected with Gatekeeper.In many ways this film feels quite dated and in many ways it is obviously far-fetched; if you can overlook these faults though it is a decent paranoid thriller with plenty of tense moments. Sandra Bullock did a fine job as the protagonist although I found it a little hard to believe that somebody as socially awkward as Angela Bennett would have worn THAT bikini... it did look good on her though! The rest of the cast were good enough although none of the other characters were really fleshed out. If you can suspend belief enough to accept that it might be possible to completely steal some ones identity the film as a nice streak of paranoia running through it; how would a person behave if nobody believed who they said they were any more? Over all I'd say this is far from being a classic but it was much better than I expected and is worth watching if you want a reasonable thriller.

Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the killers incompetenceFirst encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh.Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot.Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha.Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this killer killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies. I believe the answer is yes.I commend this movie to that very hardcore minority of movie fans who can bear to watch a shocker of a film to find that rough diamond of abominable writing. Just focus on Devlin and you will be laughing from start to finish.

For all I know, it could happen.Computer debugger Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) came across a mysterious disk that gained her access to anything she could possibly want the FBI mainframe, the White House, anything. With this disk, it's possible to alter someone's flight path or their medical records. But when she returns to the US after a vacation in Mexico, she discovers that her identity has been deleted, and because she's a loner, no one knows who she is. Now she has to stay alive long enough to prove her identity.Sandra Bullock is probably one of the most consistently lovable actresses out there. To see her is to love her; she's that adorable.

Jeremy Northam is perfect in his role, ably doing everything that the role requires of him. Dennis Miller tones down his comic aptitude and presents a friendly guy.Many people have compared The Net to Alfred Hitchcock, and that is totally understandable.

The characters are pretty well-written, though I found that Sandra Bullock's character, being that she's a hacker, would be less naive and would have anticipated at least a few of the things that took place in the movie, being that most of it involves hacking. The thriller aspect of the film is fairly well-executed, the chases are exciting and reasonably realistic, though a few of them are less than credible. I thought the whole hacker aspect of the movie, and the idea that something like this could happen in real life was the most interesting and exciting part of this movie, unfortunately it's not as well-executed as it should have been, and could have been.

First off, this movie would lead one to believe that no one uses PC's (uh, right), since every single computer used is a Mac, even at the convention. At least the writers correctly predicted Macs would be running Unix (in a way).  But there are just so many plot holes and illogical actions that this movie is just a waste of almost two hours.  True, the plot holes aren't Final Destination bad, but they are still glaringly obvious.  It's like the writers took a stock conspiracy film and slapped a weak Internet plot on it.

One of those adjectives I've just used above is the reason which made me add 1/2 a star to the one I would have given. So is it a case of 'so bad it is good'? No. It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'. Bullock in a (surprise!) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. She works at home, doesn't have any friends and her neighbors don't know her. Suddenly, she sees herself involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her. Her identity, bank accounts, etc, etc, etc, are all deleted, and she is now Ruth Marx. The conspiracy involves even the government and... Wait! Haven't we seen this before? Yes, thousands of times. The Net tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the '90s, showing the computer as a villain. Big deal! It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. Take the scene of the boat accident. I just laughed when the camera started to get slow...What makes everything even worse here is Sandra Bullock. How awful she is! Has she already made a decent film? A Time to Kill, okay. But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.The vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in 2001 A Space Odyssey, the best, most intelligent and most complex film ever made. It's not needed to compare The Net with it, is it...?The only reason to see The Net is to laugh, as I've said, and to see what it tried to be.

I'm a huge fan of Sandra.  Some of the plot elements are far fetched.  But, the main idea of people using technology to control things is not a bad idea.  I don't think that idea is that far out there. A good number of people have given this movie a hard time about its representation of some technology.  This is not a documentary on technology or a learning program.  The reason things seemed to happen unnaturally fast (especially for 1995) is that the movie makers have to fit everything within a couple of hours.  Nobody wants to sit around and watch people get on the Internet and watch things get downloaded slowly.  They had to keep the pacing of the movie moving somewhat fast.  One of my favorite things about the movie is the music.  I have the soundtrack on CD.  The music is by Mark Isham.  The music is great, but the sad thing is that there is only 29 minutes and 31 seconds of music on the CD.  There's alot of music they didn't put on the CD that was in the movie.  Oh, well.

I am also definitely blown away by the whole if it's plugged in, its under their control setup, which makes total sense when you think about it.  In this film, even computers which would have no reason to be anything but a stand-alone, are totally under the control of the omnipotent bad guys. Right on.      I hate this movie on so many levels that in writing about it  my biggest problem is that I simply don't know which element of it I want to complain about first.  Now maybe if they'd set the whole thing in the future, at least we could write it off as totally science fiction, but since we're set in the good old present, its totally open to criticism and boy does it deserve it.  To sum up, the entire plot is centered around the hope that the audience knows absolutely nothing about computers, the main character is incredibly miscast, the conclusion is horribly convenient, and once again, the premise is horribly unbelievable.  What luck that the protagonist has virtually no friends, and only one family member who is so stricken with Alzheimer's disease that she doesn't even know her own name.  Yes, this further reinforces the scary, It could happen to anyone premise.  Because when you get right down to it, who in this world really has more than three friends?  No one as far as I see it, so yes, Sandra Bullock's plight in this film is universal.  So thank you, Sandra, for touching all our lives with a story that not only informs us as to the dangers of incredibly fictional, only-in-the-movies type cyber-badguys, but it also lets us know how close we all are to being erased.

The Net is an enjoyable entertainment though, thanks to Sandra Bullock's natural every-girl appeal - she may not have the face of a model, and she's no Jodie Foster, but somehow Sandra manages to keep you interested in what's happening to her. Bullock not only carries the limping storyline, but the 'along for the ride' support cast as well. Mark Isham's score is catchy, but not utilised nearly enough.Good fun, but Disclosure it is not.

Angela Bennett (Bullock) is a computer whiz kid who works out of her home finding flaws in and debugging new programs sent to her on disc by her employer.  One day she inadvertently stumbles across one that is so big it sets off a chain reaction of intrigue that places her at the eye of the storm, though she hasn't a clue as to what it's all about.  All she knows is that suddenly she's not herself any more; at least according the records stored on hard drives everywhere.  And it's only the beginning of complications, the likes of which would give anyone with even the slightest bit of paranoia nightmares. 	With a plot that would make Kafka proud, this precursor to the even more paranoia-inducing `Enemy Of The State,' is a dark, cautionary tale of the misuse of a  technology that has quickly encompassed virtually every walk of life, yet without anyone having first harnessed the full fury of it's potential.  A work of fiction?  Of course; one could even say `science' fiction.  But in this case the technology is already in place, and anyone who wants YOU badly enough need look no further than the data base of the DMV, a credit card bureau or the Post Office, and they will quickly know more about you than you know yourself.  For those who would scoff, there's an old adage that goes something like  Anything that can be used `for' you can also be used `against' you.  At the very least it's food for thought that could keep those with opposing views on the matter debating endlessly.  Or, as in this case of this movie, it's enough to drive the average computer hacker to the brink of madness.  Shades of Lovecraft. 	At any rate, Winkler has given us an engrossing film that is intense and so exasperating, as you can only sit by and watch helplessly as he puts Angela through her paces, while Bullock makes it all convincing with an excellent performance, making Angela believable as an average girl-next-door whose frame of reference doesn't go much beyond her computer screen.  And all without making her too innocent or naive; she strikes an honest chord with her character that makes her one with whom the audience can readily identify, which is one of the strengths of the movie.  She evokes such empathy that it's easy to feel what it would be like to be in her place; and through her eyes, it's not a pretty sight.   	The supporting cast includes Jeremy Northam (Jack), Dennis Miller (Alan), Diane Baker (Mrs. Bennett), Wendy Gazelle (Ruth Marx) and Ken Howard (Bergstrom). Along with the dawning of a new age in technology comes the birth of a new era in fiction that will forevermore be fueled by the microchip.  And if `The Net' is any indication, buckle your seat belts, because it's going to be an intense, bumpy-- and highly entertaining-- ride (as already evidenced by `The Matrix,' as well as the aforementioned `EOTS').  It's inevitable that the questions of possibility or probability will arise, especially when a film like this has a contemporary setting; but the most important thing to remember is that if projects such as this fall into capable hands, we'll all be in for some exciting cinema.  It's all a matter of using the magic wisely.  I rate this one 6/10.

It's hard to assess THE NET as a computer espionage thriller. It is less action than Enemy of the State (1998) and less poignant in some ways that War Games (1983), and not quite as intimately juvenile/teenager and smooth and polished as Antitrust (2001). In some ways The Net is a psychological thriller that depends more on the subtle, covert computer focus than most of the other movies in as such might be considered a much better, pure form of the this subgenre of computer-espionage thriller. There is the mother-daughter subtext as well as the rather powerful deception twist and the friendship and loss scenes that have some impact. Interestingly the climax seems long in coming and the frustration level quite high in this particular movie. Much of Sandra Bullock's behavior and action seem to be consistent and reasonable considering the circumstance she finds herself and fascinating in that she doesn't need to depend on extraordinary measures outside of her on-screen character which in some ways dampens the excitement of the movie but at the same time places it more in the human-reality context.

Sandra Bullock is funny, refreshing, and tragic by turns, as a nobody caught in the middle of a major conspiracy to take over the Internet, and thereby, our very lives.Like many good films, The Net lets us see things from various points of view at once. When Angela is trying to explain her predicament to her court-appointed lawyer, we can see her paranoia as both understandable from her point of view and as the typical defensive craziness that her public defender might see.Jeremy Northam is perfect as the bad guy who can't seem to decide whether he wants to prolong the sexual tension of the chase or just kill her and get it over with.As one other reviewer here has noted, this film is very Hitchcockian. It reminded me of Strangers on a Train the carousel scene seems to be a direct reference to Train, and the whole theme of Angela meeting a stranger who then takes over her life is very similar. The film is very skillfully edited for suspense. For example, the scene on the boat when Angela discovers the gun she is shown just discovering it right before Devlin comes up to the deck, but by the time he gets there, she's quite prepared for his arrival, although you think she's a goner. This sort of editing is masterful and really adds to the suspense.The scene where she confronts Devlin on the boat is my favorite I just love how she says So.... who are you...Jack? -- she gives the word Jack just the right staccato emphasis. Devlin's response is classic, and gives away his badness perfectly; and then the camera focusing on only half his face at a time (eyes/mouth) is perfect, also. This recalls the camera's focus on Angela's mouth when she's typing to the chat room before. The implication is that we are just mouths on the Internet (typing words) and eyes in real life (sexual attraction), and we have to connect the two somehow.I also liked the use of names Champion for Angela's only friend, Devlin for the devilishly evil Jack, Angela (often shortened to Angel) to denote Angela's essential innocence.Angela's mother having Alzheimer's reinforces Angela being cut off from people -- the person she's closest to doesn't even remember her name. I always get teary during the scene where she's trying to get her mom to identify her to the cop (although Angela calling her may be putting her mom in danger, it's a very human thing for her to do).Over the course of the movie, we see Angela changing she's starting to value her friends and family more, and realizing that she's been cut off from people. Ironically, Devlin is one of the instruments of her growing understanding, when he tells her that we're really very similar, you and I. She's shocked into realizing that she *is* tied to her family (such as it is) with a bond of love (even her defense of her absentee father to Champion brings us some insight into her feeling for her family). This attachment to people is something neither Devlin nor the imposter Angela can understand (for example, the imposter Angela looks around at the computer convention and says Let's get outta here, all these people are making me nervous). Annie Lennox's cover of Whiter Shade of Pale is used in the film, most appropriately. Angela is a vestal virgin in many ways, who must go through some pretty psychedelic experiences to find herself.An important aspect of this film is obviously its portrayal of a brief moment in history when only a few organizations and hackers were aware of the vast potential of the Internet. Because this film was made in 1995, it conveys the feeling of newness of all the technology. This makes Angela's isolation from others both easier to understand (weren't all hackers at that time isolated from those who had no idea what the Internet was?) and more frightening will we all soon succumb to the Net's seductive pull? The computer aspects of the film were actually quite impressive if not totally realistic for the technology of the time, at least the film has aged well. For the time it was made, the film's understanding of the role the Internet would play in our lives was almost prophetic. The main point about the use of the technology in the film, however, is that it does *not* override the human story.Overall, I recommend this film as highly entertaining and suspenseful, with the theme of the dangerous implications, for both the individual and society, of our new computer technology.

She does everything by the net- order pizza, book airline tickets or reveal personal details to someone who lives all the way in India. Even her neighbours have not seen her and her mother has a memory problem and does not recognise her daughter. She also works as a computer programmer for a computer company and gets rid of viruses attached to disks.One day a very valuable disk is sent to her with all the programming details and baddies decide that they want it. Angela Bennett is an appropriate person to snatch it from because nobody knows her and if she ends up dead nobody will miss her. Therefore her life is completely changed and turned around before you can even say watch out, you daft woman!.Watching how Angela Bennett gets herself out of the mess is very thrilling. It is superbly directed and Sandra is believable. You find yourself rooting for her until the very end. It is her show all the way as there is no hero opposite her though Jeremy Northam is very effective as the baddie.Rating 8 out of 10.

Seeing it now, fourteen years after it's original release, I'm a little flabbergasted as to how time flies. Being in my mid 20's, it made my childhood feel ancient. I felt as if I should probably do some exercise before my body starts stacking up fat in all the wrong places. Cut down on fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes.Anyway, that was the best part of this movie experience for me. I'd say the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me occupied with retro heaven. Look at those big cans they call computers. Look, they chat in chat rooms! I remember those tank tops! They look.... stupid. And hey, it even stars Sandra Bullock. First billed! Would you look at that.As a movie, The Net is just an unimaginative, plain and totally routine Hitchockian cat-and-mouse thriller. Nothing archaic about that, they made them then as much as they make them now. Bullock plays a reclusive computer nerd who's job it is to fix software for people who don't get that whole computer thingy. As it happens, she stumbles upon some delicate information and after her vacation trip ends up with her nearly getting killed by a sexy lay who turns out to be a killer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should have been suspicious by the fact that they are in an American movie and the guy both smokes and has a British accent!) she gets her identity wiped out. Her house is empty, for sale, and upon checking it out, it turns out that she now has got a new identity. A convicted prostitute and impostor, no less.Now you might say that this is improbable. How could they possibly do that to her? Even in 1995, it's impossible! That's true, but back in '95 a lot of people didn't even know what the Internet was. I can see how it's a plot hole you could have accepted back then. What's far more disastrous though is the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. The movie obviously owes a lot to Hitchcock movies (it's one of those thrillers that feature a merry-go-round by night) but Hitchcock always made sure that his movies were plausible. The characters didn't act like confused maniacs when trying to prove their innocence, and the plot didn't conveniently lay down for a structure where one obstacle inevitable leads to the other. The characters also tried a little before giving into the whole rouge chase. Has Bullock's character really no friends what so ever? Couldn't any old high school teacher confirm her identity? Or like... her nearest pizza guy? Oh right, she orders pizza from the Internet. Never mind. You figure the movie out pretty quickly. There seems to be hope in an ex boyfriend. You really think so? You should always count on at least ONE surprise. The Net offers none.The Internet poses a lot of danger, this movie seems to predict. But, had the movie been made today, imagine the troubles the villains would have to go through to ensure the identity wipe. Not only do they have to do all those boring literal things, she would still have her Facebook membership, with at least like 100 friends or so, and picture tags, not to mention she might be on YouTube or Linked-In, and what about her video blog with like 150 daily hits, or the webcams in her house and recorded video of her in other people's cell phones, webcams, web downloads... her IMDb membership?

No plot details here, as many other users give that. Just to clear up something elsewhere noted...easy to miss, as it's one line in a single conversation. The reason no one at Angela's office recognizes her and she doesn't go to the Chronicle building to use the computer is she has never been to SF or her office. She works out of her home in Venice Beach (near L.A.), making her a telecommuter before that was common, and incidentally pointing how very very good at legit hacker work she is supposed to be, that the company allows this.My comment concerns Sandra Bullock's character itself. Angela is supposed to be a supremely competent computer nerd on the level of a hacker, who is pretty much out of it socially. It makes sense that she is such a moron in regards to the men in the movie. But it's asinine that this extremely knowledgeable and competent woman would fly around squeaking help me help me! like a subnormally intelligent barefoot and pregnant little woman, taking actions like pressing every button on a radio three times fast and randomly while squeaking help me! help me! into the mic after the first murder attempt, make not the slightest attempt to protect herself (or anyone else) from the myriad and one things computers control which she obviously knew all about before any of this started, never be at all wary of anyone or anything until the movie is almost over...in short, she acts like the housewifey computer illiterate unable to even figure out the remote for the TV type awash in a sea of confusion throughout the movie, and the few moments of her sitting at some desk somewhere using some computer as if she knows all about it as well as the other character's comments about her switching servers and covering her tracks all ring utterly false because of it. This broad so clearly could not figure out how to hit the power button by herself, there is no way she would be able to handle a comp, much less do any of the things she supposedly does. That ruins an otherwise fun, if not technologically accurate, movie.Let's hope next time around Bullock's part isn't destroyed by a writer who believes that any woman who is good in a males only job must be shown up as really being the typical hysterical idiot female.

Only problem is that the Social Security people don't have their data available to the general public, i.e. on the Internet - or if they do, it's not deletable, (read-only), and, believe me, they have a backup safely stored away - not reachable from the Internet (something else would be down right stupid). There would have to be a physical break in (like the people who tried to break into the Watergate building - only they were caught, and correct me if I'm wrong it wasn't even a Federal building), if such a thing was to happen.Then there is your files at the IRS... Do you have a criminal past? If so, the Police have files on you - possibly even stored as PAPER COPIES. Have you ever gone to the dentist? They don't normally keep the X-ray pictures of your bad teeth stored digitally. In short, the data about your person is spread out over a wide area, so just DELETING you isn't that easy.Yes, cell phones can be triangulated, even tapped. Again, there would have to be a PHYSICAL break in. It isn't enough for a geek to find a wire dug into the ground. To achieve such an absolute control of a human being - or at least over the data on a human being, would require such a level of conspiracy and down right corruption that the whole country would probably be in danger of a coup d'etat (what I'm implying is that the country would have to be on the verge of civil war).As for the film; it's entertaining enough, and if your willing to let go of the Realities of Life (and the Internet) it's down right scary (besides Bullock is really cute). But it isn't anything more than pure entertainment. The philosophy behind it is too weak for that. Besides the film rides on a wave of technophobia, so it's basically a just a cheap sell out on the fears of the novice or non-Internet user.For something really scary - and a much better kick at the dangers of a controlled society, read 1984 or Animal Farm by George Orwell, or Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. These books at least doesn't try to hide the fact that they're Science Fiction. If you want to see a better film about the phenomenon, see Hackers. The Matrix is the sci-fi part, and a classic, and for pure Net-action see Swordfish.

No, really.) as a charming bad guy with the superhuman ability to hack into every computer in the world in the blink of an eye.   Ms Bullock is a talented performer, with a huge range of facial expressions, both of which are shown to their full effect in this marvellous drama.  Firstly, she smiles.  This indicates that she is happy.  Then, right before your eyes, she does not smile.  This indicates that she is scared, sad, confused, asleep, or about to whack the bad guy in the face with a fire extinguisher.  It really is a privilege to watch. Mister Northam is also a talented performer.  I am still unclear as to his reasons for never wanting to talk about The Net or have it brought up in interviews.  Perhaps he's ashamed.  Yes, ashamed, because everything he has done since pales into insignificance.  Perhaps. You can tell this movie is going to be good because all the male characters have deliberately bad haircuts and awful clothes.  This is a sure sign of quality in any movie.  But especially this one. Also, the work we see people doing on computers is completely realistic and believable at all times.  For example, when Bullock goes onto some chat site she types in a comment and a reply pops up quicker than the person at the other end would have time to read it, never mind reply to it.  Yes, this happens to me every day. Also, when she wants to get onto some Swiss web site the screen displays something along the lines of Welcome to the Internet Suisse.  Every country has a site that acts as a gateway to all its websites.  This is true.   What this movie has in abundance, is heart.  I challenge anyone to pay money to see this in a cinema or on video and not to feel deeply upset afterwards.   I saw this on TV (so it was free.  Truly I am blessed) and I stayed awake for almost its entire running time.   Finally, I would just like to say that if Sandra Bullock does not get nominated for an Oscar soon, she should give up acting and do something else.  Anything else.  If she is not to be properly appreciated then she should just tell Hollywood to go to hell and let that be the end of it.  Perhaps it will only be after her death (Heaven forbid!) that her true talents come to be appreciated.  I can only hope and pray that The Net will one day be seen as the classic it is, and will finally be allowed to take its place in the pantheon of Great Movies, right next to Speed II Cruise Control.

The extent to which our dependency on computer-based data leaves us all vulnerable to those who can find ways to corrupt it is a quite realistic aspect of this film. Makes you appreciate those who insist that plain old paper records be kept around, just in case.There are a number of factual improbabilities and impossibilities in The Net, but by and large they are of the sort that one excuses for the sake of drama.

And there are a few rather formulaic predictabilities when she's had sex with the guy, you can be he'll either turn out to be dirty or doomed; much the same for the therapist.But no matter. It's a great film. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have, see it again.

I'm very fond of computers in general - hence why a 1995 film about identity theft on the Internet could not be left unseen. I had some bad echoes about it, but in the end, I wasn't so disappointed  the story, though classical, is kind of interesting and must have been really new back in the days when it was released in theatres. I was gladly surprised when I figured out that contrary to what we usually see, computer-performed actions are somehow realistic, as they use Windows 3.x and normal computers. The storytelling is median and not bothering the viewer. The end is typically American. The actors' performance is globally OK, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her oh my god why me way to behave, but this time she seems to have controlled herself. I'd recommend that movie.

Basically in Venice, California is computer expert and a systems and software analyst Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock), she works from home for Cathedral Software as a contract employee, and as she mostly communicates online and by telephone she has interpersonal relationships and hardly any with people, even her own mother (Diane Baker) who suffers Alzheimer's disease. A new security system called Gatekeeper is becoming universally used, it seems it will thrive for Cathedral in the computer software world as they created it, there also appears on a Cathedral game to be a virus, and a œÄ (Pi) symbol appears on the systems occasionally, but Angela is ready for a vacation in Cozumel, Mexico. There she meets suave Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam), he is not all he seems though, as he pays a mugger to steal Angela's purse to take the disk out of it, following a romantic night together on a speedboat she finds his gun and realises he was going to kill her, she steals back the disk and escapes in a dinghy, but she collides with the rocks, destroying the disk and falling unconscious for three days. Angela wakes up and finds that all records of her identity have been deleted, someone checked her out of the hotel, her car is missing, her credit cards are invalid, her house is for sale, and her social security number is under the name Ruth Marx, her name appears under a number of criminal offences. Another woman has taken her identity, the impostor offers to give her the life she had stolen back in exchange for the disk, which of course no longer exists, the only person she knows could help her get things back to normal, who recognises her facially, is her psychiatrist and former lover Alan Champion (Dennis Miller). With Angela's knowledge of computer systems she uses a password she found in Devlin's wallet and goes to Bethesda Naval Hospital to access confidential records, finding out a conspiracy and about cyberterrorists and hackers the Praetorians, of course she is tracked along the way by Devlin, working as a contract killer for the cyberterrorists. There is a point where she is arrested due to the crimes listed on her changed records, but she manages to escape, but she is now accused of murder, so she has to rush to prove her innocence and release evidence of the corrupt security system incidents, it is at a computer convention that she accesses the systems once again, while Devlin and the impostor Ruth Marx (Wendy Gazelle) search for her. By the time they find Angela she has already sent all the evidence she gained to the FBI, and she is able to trick Devlin into erasing her false identity, chasing her he unintentionally shoots dead Ruth Marx, and she sprays a fire extinguisher causing him to fall from a catwalk to his death, the film ends with Angela reuniting with her mother and life going back to normal. Also starring Ken Howard as Michael Bergstrom, Ray McKinnon as Dale Hessman, Daniel Schorr as WNN Anchor, L. Scott Caldwell as Public Defender, Robert Gossett as Ben Phillips and Margo Winkler, Irvin's wife as Mrs. Raines. Bullock certainly proves a good choice being the originally lonely computer geek turned innocent fugitive breaking into a number of computers to sort herself out, and it is likely that this was made to coincide with the popularising of the internet, but Northum is rather wooden as the villain, the story is a little overcomplicated and confusing at times, and it could have been a little more pacey and have more frantic hide and seek style chases, but it is near watchable enough, an alright thriller. Okay!

It is fiction, it is entertainment, but it does raise some early (1995) issues regarding internet security. In this story the protagonist finds that her enemies know everything about her. Today (2007) the news has similar stories, but stemming from a different mechanism -- people putting too much personal information on sites like FaceBook and MySpace.Sandra Bullock is programming genius Angela Bennett. She works out of her L.A. area home, often getting programs on floppy discs (never see those anymore!) so that she can de-bug them and get her clients on their way. She goes on a much-needed vacation to a Mexico beach, where she meets an apparently nice British fellow, also a computer geek, Jack Devlin played by Jeremy Northam. But she quickly finds that not all is as it appears to be.The movie basically turns into a cat-n-mouse game to see if Angela can keep from getting killed, and also save the world from a rogue software company. Good enough entertainment, and Bullock is pleasant. Dennis Miller is good as her psychiatrist and friend Dr. Alan Champion .SPOILERS. Jack is a killer, hired by rogue software firm that markets a Gatekeeper software as a way to protect computer systems, when in fact it is the opposite, it allows its operators to hack into virtually anything. A high-profile Washington official kills himself because his records falsely show he has AIDS. Angela has her identity altered, so that she appears to be Ruth Marx, and with a long police record. All this makes it hard for her to gain credibility for the information she discovers, but her cunning eventually prevails. She saves the world.

I cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story.No computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface. It may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts.As for tracing people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way. Network security alone would prevent that from happening. The key stroke logging was laughable to say the least.Regarding the software that was supposedly being installed, no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested, retested and tested again on a sandbagged system.But probably the worst possible part of the movie was the virus. There is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system. And as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds, that just beggars belief. There is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow deletion of system files.I could go on but I can't be bothered.A porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage.

I must admit that DVD have revolutionized this habit. For instance, i can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential trait of the personality. In my country, non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations french voice is terrible, very far away of its original tone ! the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices !!!! And well, if everybody found my comments unuseful, well, in 2006, I will stop my reviews... Ah,AH.... So, enjoy them now !!!! My summary means that the story, locations, cast is not very enjoyable...Only....Sandra bullock is there.. She is a talented actress, able to get the viewer to catch on the movie....It reminds of a feminine the fugitive.... So if you look for a moment of escaping your life, watching this movie makes it worse because Sandra's life is a mess....She got nothing left to hold on to, only her poor mother (Who is Alzheimer ill again the touch for depression)....In fact, she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie, has a sadder life throughout it, to finally get back to it at the end.... what a happy ending !!!!maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd's life....very far away from the best computer movie of all time *WARGAMES* "},{"Title":"It was Horrible.","Date":"4 November 2008","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" This movie was horrible.

Can there be anything more boring ? Sitting in front of a computer all day typing away at some keys all day every day , tap tap tapping . That's much of the problem with this movie , the heroine sits in front of a computer VDU tapping the keys and no matter how many looks of agitation she gives , or how much suspenseful notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close ups the director uses there's not much excitement down to the fact that there's few things less exciting than watching somebody on a computer There's a few other problems too much of them factual errors regarding how computers work . Is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet ? I guess that when THE NET was made 10 years ago very few people would understand how computers worked so the screenwriters would have been able to BS at length but since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer the audience are certainly very clued up on the factual errors of this movie . And of course there's too many instances where someone acts stupid or out of character at crucial times in order to progress the plot which makes THE NET a very mediocre movie "}]
