My favorite line in the whole movie is when Keats and Moses are pulled over by the cops and Moses has to pretend he's mentally challenged and while pulling a dopey face he says Disneylaaaaaaaaahhhhhnd. Hillarious. James Caan made a brief cameo as Sandler's notorious boss, Coulton and that was cool too.This movie is no Academy Award winner, but so what!

One of them is an undercover cop while the other is a criminal, but also quite timid, but has joined forces, and then earned the emnity, of a major drug lord.The movie opens with the cop and Archie Moses as best friends stealing a car, but we quickly learn that the cop is an undercover cop who is trying to bust a drug dealer who owns a huge car dealership. Moses then brings the cop to the factory and it is discovered that he is a cop and the police raid the place. The cop wants to protected Archie, but due to an accident, Archie shoots him in the head. Months later, the cop has fallen in love with his therapist and Archie is running from the drug lord. He is found by the police but requests that this cop return and escort him back.There isn't much to say about this movie other than how they begin as best friends, but after the truth is revealed, Archie cannot trust him anymore. The cop in upset because Archie shot him, but does not want to believe that it was an accident. We also know that somebody else is tipping them off, but we do not know who, but the movie is about the friend's betrayal, and is summed up in Archie's comment to the cop, now you know how it feels to be betrayed by a friend. The drug lord is interesting because he also owns a used car yard and we always see his advertisement on television. It is as if this guy is flaunting himself in front of everybody, and those who know the truth about him are frustrated because they cannot get at him. Archie has the evidence, but the guy wants Archie dead because of his relationship with the cop.This is not a bad movie, but Adam Sandler has done far better.

The best thing I can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute.The most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop off at a hunting lodge/motel. I'm not quite sure what the point of this sequence is - it just seems gratuitous in the extreme. The proprietor of the hunting lodge (Charlie) is a very nerdy looking guy. For some reason, Moses starts a conversation with Charlie about porno, jacking off, homosexual sex, sex in a threesome... Charlie's photo of his wife appears to be Charlie dressed in drag. There is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene. Anyway, the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked Moses ends up with Carter's gun up his butt and Charlie sees them through the window. It all reeks of school boy humour about homosexuality - horrified and titillated all at the same time - which I don't find funny at all.I have a friend who is always raving about Adam Sandler movies.

Title represents a relationship that has gone through tremendous difficulty due to broken trust and lifestyles. It stars Damon Wayans as an undercover cop who grows fond of a street criminal, played by Adam Sandler until he is discovered wired. Police invade the location and bullets fly and Sandler accidentally shoots Wayans in the head in an attempt to escape. He recovers in the hospital with a metal plate in his head then he is assigned to transport Sandler until a parade of bullets intercede leaving them as lone survivors. The rest is formula with an ending similar to that of The Rock. Basically a series of corny situations to test Wayans's tolerance of Sandler. Directed by Ernest Dickerson who previously made the controversial Juice, and here does his best with the stale material. Wayans and Sandler travel material that nearly every buddy comedy duo sets foot on. James Caan is typecast as the villain. Kristen Wilson is also wasted, as is James Farentino as Wayans's superior officer who orders the transfer. Typical buddy comedy that is hardly bulletproof.

Basically in Los Angeles, small time crook and thief Archie Moses (Razzie nominated Adam Sandler) works for local drug dealer Frank Colton (James Caan), he is unaware that his best friend Rock Keats, real name Jack Carter (Damon Wayans), is in fact an undercover LAPD cop, who is seeking evidence against Colton, he befriended Moses to infiltrate Colton's gang. One night, Jack gets Moses drunk and manages to get information from him, the police are sent to raid Colton's warehouse, it is then that Archie that realises Jack is a cop, during his escape attempt an out of control crane hits Archie in the back of the head, he accidentally fires his gun, shooting Jack in the head. Jack miraculously survives, makes a full recovery with the help of physical therapist Dr. Traci Flynn (Kristen Wilson), Archie trying to flee the state is caught and arrested, brought into custody he agrees to testify against Colton, after his recovery Jack's superior officer Captain Jensen (James Farentino) orders him to escort Acrhie to the courtroom for the trial on the other side of the country. Jack feels bitter towards Archie following the accidental gunshot to the head, and the simple transfer becomes complicated when federal agents and Los Angeles Police Department officers have been bribed by Colton, learning of Archie's attempt to testify, whilst being chased by hired thugs and assassins Jack and Archie slowly rebuild their friendship. However Colton apparently has Flynn hostage and is blackmailing Jack to turning in Archie to save her, the two of them pretend to comply with this and shoot their way through Colton's guards, but it turns out that Flynn was responsibility for leaking their location, she is in fact on Colton's payroll. Jack distracts Colton after Archie gets a bullet in the shoulder, he apprehends Archie and Flynn and manages to kill Colton, Archie gives the incriminating documents about Colton to Jack, he is then let go, heading to Mexico to become a bullfighter, accompanied his mother and Jack. Also starring Jeep Swenson as Bledsoe, Larry McCoy as Detective Sulliman, Allen Covert as Detective Jones, Sister Act's Bill Nunn as Finch, Patch Adams' Monica Potter as Biker's Woman and Homeland's Maury Sterling as Skinny Guy. Wayans and Sandler are not highly convincing as the former friends fallen out and slowly building bridges, Caan gets a short time as the crime lord, the performances are mostly annoying, this has a pretty lame and predictable script and storyline, the jokes aren't all that funny, the violence is relatively okay, and the only dynamic moments are the shooting sequences and some chases, but all in all it was a rather dull action comedy.

You know it isn't what you should be eating. Nevertheless, it smells delicious and makes you smack your lips together when you chew. The action scenes, when the bad guys (sometimes even the good guys) get the cream puffs kicked out of them, contain a lot of crunch. The crude-oil Saturday Night Live comic scenes, which only anal retentive Neanderthals would savor as instructive, are uproariously self-effacing. Serious film genre scholars may give an appreciative nod to Bulletproof simply because it triggers happier memories from classic action pictures, such as Clint Eastwood's The Gauntlet (1977), Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite (1974), and the 1958 Tony Curtis & Sidney Poitier version of The Defiant Ones. Nobody but the average moviegoers who really knows the two perquisite words in movie-going&#x97;fun and fake&#x97;will truly appreciate this potboiler of a melodrama, with comedy tosses in a spice, for what it aspires to be.The corpses pile up as fast as the clichÃ©s in the derivative Joe Gayton and Lewis Colick screenplay. As Detective Keats, Damon Wayans is cast as an undercover cop who convinces Moses (Adam Sandler's dopey but likable criminal blunder brain) that he is his best friend. The trouble begins when Keats bonds a little too well with Moses. Keats feels personally committed to bringing Moses in alive and well. When they try to reel in the kingpin mobster, a wealthy used car salesman played with gleeful abandon by James Caan of The Godfather. Keats concerns himself more Moses' welfare than the bust. In a weird Pulp Fiction torque of events, Moses shoots Keats in the head but neither kills nor cripples him.Moses freaks out, leaves for Mexico, with his pooch (one of those magpie-looking Spuds McKenzie types) to become a bullfighter. The law catches up with Moses, and he agrees to testify against his boss (James Caan) on the condition that Keats serve as his bodyguard. Although Damon Wayans is a truly gifted comic, he could take lessons from his brother Keenen Ivory about playing beefy, tough-guys. Damon acts more like his Major Payne character here when he should have used his rugged quarterback hero from The Last Boy Scout. He is a cheese cake action hero here. But it is fun to watch the antics of Wayans and Sandler (a foul-mouthed, 1950s' era Jerry Lewis wannabe) as they blunder through a series of impossible obstacles. The filmmakers serve up seemingly non-stop action like a Saturday Morning television cartoon. They plunge our bulletproof heroes into several unreal but really predictable predicaments. Eventually, the action brings our buddies to the big shoot'em up in James Caan's palatial residence and at least one surprise. If you figure out that surprise before the Dickerson and company reveal it, you have obviously gone into the wrong theater.Juice director Dickerson got his start as a cinematographer for Spike Lee in epics such as Do The Right Thing, makes Bulletproof look more visually slick and sophisticate than it deserves to be considering how imitative it remains. Each shot contains imaginative compositional elements that you won't be able to savor on a small screen. The lighting is extremely well-done. Actor James Farentino, who plays Wayan's sinister police department superior, is lighted so evocatively that he appears suspicious.Dickerson's big problem here is that the headlong action must break intermittently at all comedy stops. Bulletproof employs comedy to insulate its audiences from the effect of thinking too much about the wildly improbable scenes of simulated violence that recur throughout the film. After somebody gets iced, a joke is delivered to make you forget that they've been killed or, in the case of our heroes, escaped certain death.James Caan indulges himself as the used car salesman drug lord. In one scene, he removes his toupee so it won't get dirty during a showdown with Wayans. Caan gives his villainy the appropriate inflection for the kind of hokum that pads out Bulletproof. He is nowhere near the bastard that he was in the Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller Eraser. The usual quota of souped-up car chases, gunfights, and four-letter oaths ought to delight hardcore action fans, but they may miss the more amorous matings that occur in the more dramatic male sagas. Composer Elmer Bernstein enhances the super-charged action scenes with some humming, hipster-cool incidental music, especially in the introductory urban car chase scene. Bulletproof is definitely no classic, but it has its share of entertaining moments.

The thrillers with 2 totally discordant partners are quite familiar since the start of the 1980s. The formula got (Lethal Weapon) in 1987, then the sequel in 1989, where the sense of comedy was so lucid, as semi-iconic example for the buddy movie which was all over the place during that era.Once we've had 2 actors whom can do comedy (Lethal Weapon), one actor and one comedian (48 Hours), one actor to be comic and one comedian to act (Midnight Run), or 2 comedians yet into comedy (Dragnet). Here, despite how poor the atmosphere was, the main problem remains in casting strangely 2 comic tiny stars, at the time, to be the lead of what supposed to be a thriller. And the personality of the movie went wrong since that. You can't settle.. Is that a slapstick comedy, or a violent thriller ?? I was really sad because of the potentials of this hot plot, they're totally wasted.Despite the efforts (Damon Waynes) with the beard made to look serious but sorry that was in the wrong place, he was mostly cool but everything wasn't. (Adam Sandler) looked tepid or slack and relied only on his funny charisma to do the whole thing for him. (James Cann) must've needed money hard, but not to wonder because after watching him in (Alien Nation - 1988) I became convinced that I can see him in anything ! At least he had not much to do. Furthermore, some slight provocative moments (Waynes) and (Sandler) escape from the police station after threatening the whole department so dozens of policemen run after them, and THEN they're both enjoying their time in a strip club !!?? There is some excessive buffoonery also, to have that tense between being a comedy and a thriller. The direction is idealistically not cinematic, handling the mission like a TV episode, or a sitcom.. A boring serious one too. All the scenes suffered of zero budget so the word poor came with so many meanings here. Look at the deadly climax (shame to call it one in the first place) to know exactly what I mean. Basically there are better straight-to-video movies than this one !

It a load of old cobblers plot wise, and the buddy buddy thing was dying a death, but the two leads are amiable enough and Caan wasn't too bad as the villain.It's not very memorable though, and it's full of clichÃ©s, but for Sandler fans and Wayans fans, this will suffice.

I should have known by it's release date - September - I was in for less than a treat. That's after all of the summer blockbusters have been released and before the academy award possibilities start cropping up in October/November. And remember, 1996 was the year that the word blockbuster was defined by unwatchable schlock such as Independence Day and Twister.Jack Keats (Damon Wayons) is an undercover cop posing as a car thief in order to get information from a real car thief, Archie Moses (Adam Sandler). The two have actually developed a kind of friendship during the time they are working together. After gaining his trust, Moses offers to introduce Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton (James Caan). Keats jumps at the chance to home in on bigger criminal game. Thus as Keats is meeting Colton for the first time, the police appear on the scene to make their arrests in the case. In the resulting chaos, Keats is shot in the head. Keats has a slow but sure recovery. On the bright side, he falls in love with the woman who helps him recover. On the negative side, he now has a metal plate in his head. Afterwards, when he is back on duty, Keats is assigned to escort Moses back to testify against his former employer Colton, a situation neither one is looking forward to. Keats is angry because thanks to Moses he has a metal plate in his head, and Moses is angry because Keats lied to him over the entire year that he thought they were friends and colleagues. This movie seems to be going for the buddy/road film angle, with the exception of the fact that Keats and Moses run into a series of attempts on their lives since Colton, the big drug kingpin, is out to kill them both. This forces them to work together to figure out why their every move seems to be known by Colton before they even make it.Both Wayans and Sandler can be very funny if given the right material, but neither has anything particularly funny to do or say here, since the material they are working with is totally lacking in the imagination and genuine humor that could have exploited the talents of the two leading men. Avoid at all cost. The only reason I remember this movie over ten years later is (a) it is incredibly bad even for a man movie and (b) my husband insisted we go see it.

When the pickup turns into an ambush, Carter and Moses go on the run, unsure of who they can trust.Like so many other comedians, Adam Sadler had a stab at a cross over from out and out comedy into action by way of a standard buddy cop action movie. The plot here is just plain stupid and could have been written by a five year old.  The twists the film takes are just plain goofy and the plot prevents any real tension being created or action sustained.  The action set pieces are right out of A-Team except it seems to think that the audience will like to see men shot like meaningless sacks of meat.  As such the action varies between tasteless and pointless.  As far as laughs go, this is about as sparse as Sadler gets - and that's bad.  The buddy banter just continually falls flat and it just feels like it has been done so many other times and that this just tries to rip it off.Sadler does his usual shouting and rude stuff but he can't do the slightly imaginative stuff that I find funny - hence he is just annoying and really poor.  The fact that he has zero chemistry with Wayans is also a big problem.  Wayans is just so poor that he wouldn't have been able to link up with anybody here and his character and performance are so clichÃ©d that it is pathetic.  Caan must have got well paid for this cause I can see no other reason for him to be here.  He has no character, no lines, no presence and very little time on screen.  Wilson looks good but her character is just stupid for so many reasons.Overall this is poor even by the pretty low standards of Hollywood buddy cop movies.  It lacks any sort of spark in any aspect.  The comedy is poor with few if any laughs, the action is just plain simple and lacklustre - barely enough to hold the interest, while the dialogue and plot are listless and could have been cobbled together by a group of children.

I remember this came out over ten years ago, but I never got a chance to watch it until the other night.  Yes, it had some good action here and there, and I will admit, there were about two scenes that I laughed my butt off for the longest time...but the rest of the movie was very disapointing.  Neither character is likeable, and they are often given painfully bad dialogue which, considering the incredible talent from both Wayans and Sandler, seems really out of place.  I don't blame it on them, I blame it on the script.  There were way too many one liners that just weren't funny, and way too many action scenes that were incredibly cheesy.  This one reminds me of two other films, both starring a Wayans brother  The Last Boyscout and A Low Down Dirty Shame.  All three of these have that Lethal Weapon type feel, but all fail in comparison to it, though I did like The Last Boyscout and though 'Dirty Shame' was pretty good.  James Caan in this film was simply embarrassing.  It seemed to me that this veteran actor was going for a funny stereotype bad guy than a straight up evil crime lord.  Needless to say, like the dialogue, it seemed awkward and out of place.For an action comedy, save for 2 hilarious scenes (one of which involving a gun shoved up Sandler's keester), there wasn't very many funny scenes, and the action was all been there, done that type fair, seeming to just 'tack on' a few uncreative deaths here and there with inept bad guys who fire off dozens of rounds, and always, just miss the protagonists.  I will admit, the idea of having Wayans get shot in the head was unique, but as for the chemistry between the two actors, I just didn't see it, which came as a surprise.  At any rate, not a bad time waster, and not a bad movie...just lower expectations once you realize both Wayans and Sandler, two talented actors/comedians are in it.  The payoff is far less than the anticipation.  What gets me is that this movie had so much potential, yet, it fails from a very very weak script.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  6/10 stars.

I think the strongest point of the film are its two stars because they share some terrific chemistry and really take the material and do something special with it. The majority of the humor is silly R-rated stuff like porn jokes, urine jokes and other things like that but the way Wayans and Sandler sells it makes it funny. There are some hilarious moments here including a Disneyland joke early in the picture and the constant banter between the two really works well. The two actors really make you believe their characters and this allows the situation to be funny and especially in the scenes where Wayans pretty much abuses Sandler over the issue that happened at the start of the film.

Was it intentional?","Date":"26 April 2004","Score":"4 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Bulletproof is one of the most homoerotic films ever made. Either intentionally or unintentionally, it comes across as an extremely sophomoric, clichÃ©d exercise in tired comedy routines that were tried and tested since the '80s. It is yet another comedy of mixed ethnic races -- just like Running Scared, Lethal Weapon, 48 Hrs., Money Talks, etc. It's so poor that apart from an entertaining setup the movie becomes almost painful to watch.The movie stars Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler as an undercover cop and an unsuspecting criminal respectively. Wayans, whose first film was the glorious Roxanne, still knows his comedy -- it's just rather unfortunate that he has lowered his standards so far as to appear in low-grade trash such as this.Sandler, who is occasionally funny in the right role (Happy Gilmore, also released in 1996, is great), gives one of his worst performances here. He mumbles helplessly through the messy screenplay; there's a scene in which the two buddies find themselves inside a plummeting plane that had me laughing. Not because it was funny (intentionally at least) but because we are expected to believe that Sandler's character knows how to fly a plane as he takes the pilot's seat and simply pulls back on the throttle a bit to level it out. How humorous.Jack Keats (Wayans), who is doing undercover work and posing as a criminal to lure his way into a crime underworld with the help of unsuspecting partner Archie Moses (Sandler). After a powerful crime lord's operation is busted by Keats and his team, Archie accidentally shoots his so-called partner in the head.After a brief coma and a startlingly miraculous recovery, Keats is asked to transport Archie to federal protection. He reluctantly boards a plane with Archie, only to be pursued by hit men, etc. Their plane crashes, they travel a bit, uncover a crooked cop, and that's it the movie basically ends after all of this. It is a measly 84 minutes long and feels even shorter. I mean that as a negative comment. It's like watching a pilot for some sort of bad television sitcom loaded with foul language and violence -- stupid, dumb, revolting.The homosexual undercurrent I mentioned earlier is almost disturbingly blatant. Some of it seems disgustingly intentional. Of course, I'm not going to say that any movie dealing with homosexuality is appalling. But the manner in which Bulletproof goes about portraying its characters and their fetishes is most disturbing. Take, for instance, the scene in which Archie and Keats spend the night at a small-town motel, run by a nerd with thick-rimmed glasses and a face which is almost revolting to look at. For apparently no reason whatsoever, Archie goes into a long monologue asking the motel owner if he'd like to spend the night with Keats, that Keats is gay, that they should try having a sandwich sometime with the man's wife. This goes on quite appallingly for at least three minutes. All the while Keats is standing a few feet away but yet cannot hear what they're discussing? And that's just some of the film's more unappealing material. There's more, such as when Archie promises to do something with James Caan's crime lord figure that I can't even write in this review, and then later is asked whether he really said it or not. No, I don't think I said that. Then there's lines such as, I'm falling in love with you all over again, man, that indicate more than admiration between the two men. It doesn't sound as revolting as it does in the movie -- like Slackers this film leaves the viewer feeling dirty, rather than clean and uplifted. I have a firm belief that all the great buddy movies -- Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Lethal Weapon, Midnight Run for example -- primarily work because of the characters, the actors portraying them, and the screenwriter's ability to create realistic dialogue and have his characters actually go through progression. None here. Just lots of stupid chase scenes and unfunny buddy moments. If not for Going Overboard I'd call this Sandler's worst film. What a mess.2/5 stars.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Sharp and affective advice about this film.","Date":"29 December 1999","Score":"7 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  For anyone looking for an amazingly brilliant comedy starring adam sandler then this is one for you. Everyone has heard of the wedding singer, the waterboy and big daddy but this film will make you hoot with laughter just as much as those. If you are an Adam Sandler fan then this is one for you. This film is fantastic and if Adam Sandler had released it now when he is a superstar then it would be a major hit.  "},{"Title":"Good cast on paper, but apart from some slickly shot shoot-outs, this is the anti-thesis of a good buddy movie","Date":"28 December 2011","Score":"0 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" I actually wanted to like Bulletproof, despite my general dislike for Adam Sandler, because I like buddy movies and James Caan is a great actor. I give Bulletproof some credit for some slickly shot shoot-out sequences, but other than that everything else feels wrong to me. When I think of a good buddy movie, I think of likable characters, juicy dialogue to savour and some dynamicism in the action sequences. Some people watching Bulletproof may find these things, and I do respect that, however for me what I found here was the complete opposite on all counts. I really didn't care for any of the characters, finding them clichÃ©d and annoying, especially Sandler's character. In fact, I found myself rooting more for the villains, but wished there was more to them. Bulletproof just wasn't funny to me either, I love action movies with comedy when it is good, but apart from one or two mildly amusing parts the dialogue was corny and the jokes rather tasteless. There is nothing dynamic about the action sequences, they may be slickly shot but the way they are choreographed at times is inept and the complete lack of subtlety in the violence leaves a bad taste in the mouth afterwards. The story is predictable with very little coming across as truly thrilling, while all the performances fall flat. Sandler has definitely done worse and more irritating performances, but his performance consists of near-unintelligible mumbling and I found myself annoyed by his character right from the start. Damon Wayans fares better, having more charisma, but the dialogue is so lame, the chemistry between him and Sandler so forced and the character so clichÃ©d, it comes across as a wasted effort. James Caan is a great actor, but the first thought that came into my head after finishing Bulletproof was, what on earth was he doing here? He tried, but deserved so much better. Overall, a movie I wanted to like, but apart from one or two small things it didn't deliver. 1/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Surprisingly funny...","Date":"18 August 2003","Score":"0 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Funny, amusing and just darn watchable comedy about two crooks (Sandler and Wayans) who have to do a job for a kingpin (James Caan). Expected plot twists but fun to watch and Sandler doesn't do that bad. Wayans steals the show. 3 of 5. "}]
