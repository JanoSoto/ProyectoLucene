Ralph Fiennes has never been as cool as he was when the guy played Lenny Nero and Juliette Lewis was almost too sexy to be true. The whole movie is a remarkable experience. I saw it couple of days after the turning of 2000 and I was totally stunned because I expected a silly little b-scifi flick. What I got was a powerful first rate mystery thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole bloody time. I just recently watched it again and was afraid that the movie would let me down when I've seen it once but on the contrary, like wine this one only got better with age. What a shame Strange days never got the recognition it obviously deserves. This is a cult movie, at best, but the fact that it doesn't have a placing in the IMDb top 250 is a huge injustice. Definitely the best of all millennium movies. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Are we impressed yet?","Date":"12 January 2000","Score":"103 out of 133 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  The answer being, of course, yes I am impressed.What a thoroughly enjoyable film Strange Days is. Fast-moving and occasionally violent, it's not high art but then neither is it dumbed-down fodder and it has much to commend it. The central plot revolves around an ex-cop (Fiennes, doing a - to my ears anyway - convincing American accent) peddling FBI technology on the black market. The SQUID technology (Super conducting QUantum Interface Device) electronically absorbs information from the central cortex and allows users to experience the thrill of another's sensations - be it murder, sex, robbery, etc. Of course, this central idea, while fascinating, does derive pretty much directly from a Twilight Zone episode. Were this a classic Zone episode from the b/w era, then people would have picked it up straight away and the game would be over. As it is, the inspiration comes from one of the colour Twilight Zone episodes which had even less viewers than Strange Days and so the movie can rest assured it is safe in obscurity. (Give up? Okay, it was episode 23, season three, 1989, The Mind of Simon Foster. I'm an anorak, I know these things).But whether such were intentional is pretty much irrelevant as the magpie technique of this film takes from many texts and builds something greater than the parts. One of the two greatest science fiction films of the 90s - the other being the excellent Twelve Monkeys - both have built-in sell-by dates by fixing their time period in a very near locale. Hence while the supposed date of Monkeys is long past at 98, this film now becomes a historical document as of New Year's Eve 1999. But then does it follow that we will stop watching 2001 in 2002? Hopefully not, and Strange Days is one that too deserves to be revisited in years to come.The reason why I commend it most is its rewarding political stance. The development that gets adhered onto the Squid plot directly references the beating of Rodney King. Such contemporary referencing may again date it as quickly as the '99 setting, but then we also have Angela Bassett as a very empowered, yet caring black woman. Note how she and Lenny have exchanged traditional gender roles in this film, yet this feels not like some macho woman schtick but genuine characterisation. Lenny is a likeable, wisetalking street peddler who spends the film as a human punchbag. Gone is the cliched jaw-breaking action man role for him, instead his only retort to violence is I'll give you my Rolex. This sense of, if you like, PC-ness, can also be evidenced with the lesbian couple kissing as the year 2000 breaks, or the (one scene only, admittedly) appearance of a disabled man as a central character.However, the boundary-pushing elements of this movie are tainted by the appearance of Juliet Lewis in the film. A capable actress, her only role appears to be as a receptacle for various men's sexual needs or to gratuitously expose her breasts on multiple occasions. This is a great shame, and a pity that a film which has such high intentions in almost every other area should fall back on unfortunate portrayal.The dialogue is pitched just about right without being particularly clever, though occasionally it stalls. You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targetted on making it, Fiennes tells Faith (Lewis) at one point, managing to keep a straight face. Later, Bassett must endure having to say These are used emotions. It's time to trade them in and not use her gun on the scriptwriter. When the credits do roll, it's perhaps no surprise that James Cameron was the co-writer, as its slight perfunctory, by-the-numbers stance often reminds one of the machinations of Titanic. Tom Sizemore as Max is every inch the one-dimensional Cameron character, while plot twists sometimes feel heavily engineered. Maybe Jay Cocks is responsible for the script's more human feel, with particular note going to the moral debate of whether or not to expose the LAPD's murder of an influential black rapper. The two leads debate (internally, as well as verbally, a first for a Cameron movie) the implications and the possible consequences of such an action. Despite its flirtation with the mainstream, Strange Days is a film that dares to pervert the traditional course of Hollywood into a future that is worth seeing. Perhaps predictably, it made little impact at the box office.

It presents a depressing and bleak, yet worryingly probable, view of the near future, and hooks its story threads upon the impending millennium eve celebrations. Although December 31st, 1999, has been and gone since the making of this movie, it is a credit to the makers that this film still offers a plausible viewpoint about where the world might be at in the next decade or so.Ralph Fiennes seems initially miscast, but soon wins over the audience as Lenny Nero, a sleazy racketeer who sells memories captured on some form of disk, similar to virtual reality but recorded from real experiences rather than computerised ones. He is desperately trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend Faith (Juliette Lewis), but she doesn't want him as she has hooked up with a music producer named Philo (Michael Wincott). Lenny acquires two disturbing tapes, one showing the rape and murder of a woman, the other showing a racially motivated slaying, and before he knows it he is on the run from the culprits who want to kill him before he exposes their crimes. The only person he can trust is his best friend, lady bodyguard Mace (Angela Bassett). To complicate matters further, his ex-girlfriend Faith seems to know something about the disks, and may either be involved in the crimes or at great risk from those responsible.Bassett is the real star here, in the role of a lifetime as a morally strong and physically stronger heroine. Lewis plays the same old white trash girl she has played many times, but at least she has the experience to bring total conviction to the role. The production values are incredibly high, especially the party at the end which seems to realistically convey an entire city celebrating in the streets. The plot unfolds slowly, but this is a strength rather than a criticism. Each new development slots into place beautifully, and the audience is given time to get into the characters and the situations (which, in too many movies, we are not allowed to do since the pace is often too frenetic).Strange Days is challenging and aggressive and frequently disturbing. It is also inventive and exciting and ingeniously staged. It is simply a terrific science film which any devotee of the genre absolutely must see.

Science fiction, violence, peace, romance, comedy, tragedy, action, you name it -- it's in this film, and it's done with class and intelligence.  I agree that this one is destined to become a cult classic.  However, be prepared for one of the edgiest, most violent and emotionally exhausting films you've ever seen (the first three minutes of the film make it very clear what you can expect from the rest).  There are at least five climactic scenes toward the end, which must break some kind of record.  After the movie's over, you may feel like you've just been cooked in a vat of boiling oil... but luckily, you'll be perfectly well-done, not burned to a crisp.  10/10.

The first time I saw Strange Days was about five years ago, and then over and over again. If you think Ralph Fiennes is only able to play sensitive and problematic characters watch this it´s his most unusual, but one of the best performances in his career - a performance of a coolness you only would expect from Samuel L. Jackson. Angela Bassett is one of the toughest women cinema has ever seen and Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore, Glenn Plummer, William Fichtner - every single role is casted perfectly...Strange Days is thriller, drama and big city ballad in one piece. I can´t remember any movie that reflects the philosophy of life of Generation X better than this one. Lenny deals with the Squids which are the experiences and emotions of men saved on a mini disc. Emotions as a product, a drug - a compensation of modern life for the growing loneliness and anonymity. The only possibility for weak persons like Lenny to feel real. A movie like Fight Club wouln´t have been possible without Strange Days; other releases like The Cell or even Scorsese´s Bringing out the dead copied the incomparable make. Although this film is older than six years it hasn´t lost anything explosive effects, what is connected with the video clip style this movie has, which gives Strange Days a touch of being ageless. The two most brilliant scenes are the opening sequence - the robbery in the Chinese restaurant - and the showdown down in the streets at the millenium party. Also the soundtrack (Deep Forest, Peter Gabriel, Skunk Anansia, Strange Fruit...) is one of the best I´ve ever heard, what makes Strange Days an unforgettable experience for every watcher.

It has a superb plot, great timing and a spectacular ending - one of the best ever, I might add.Just about everything you see in this film adds to the momentum. Just look in the background. There is always something going on, someone getting arrested or stealing something or burning something... all of it enhances the doomsday feeling you get when watching.I also find Fiennes' acting just short of perfect. His face, his gestures and his entire being reeks of the sordid life his character leads. To cast him was genius. Lewis, Sizemore, Bassett and Wincott perform excellently as well - but it's really Fiennes that just makes this film happen.Do you want to see something unusual for a change? Do you long to see a believable sf-story for once, even despite the fact that the events of the film took place in 1999? And do you yearn for a sensational film made to make you really feel something? See Strange Days.

It also happens to be well-executed, for the most part. The LA of the future (well, future back when it was released in 1995) is quite dystopian in nature, and Strange Days manages to present all facets of that using Taxi Driver-influenced car rides through the city while observing the chaos on the streets. In many ways, Strange Days manages to create a real-life and convincing future, and it feels like a true place, with things going on independently of the events in the movie, rather than feeling like a movie set. Atmosphere aside, though, the movie has many strengths. The plot is intriguing, and it flows quite smoothly. A lot of the dialogue is really quite interesting and gives the movie a nice feel (not to mention the actors do a pretty good job with the material). The characters are three-dimension and interesting. While the beginning parts were somewhat disjointed (at least in terms of plot), they did serve as an excellent setup. When the movie was its best (during the middle parts) there is a frantic sense of urgency that really drives the picture along. It's a very entertaining movie, and it managed to form an emotional link with me - always a good sign.Unfortunately, it kind of goes downhill after that. Strange Days ends up resorting to awfully cliche ideas, complete with plot elements seen a million times in movies before. All of this mars what could have been a real classic film. It's too bad that Cameron and Cocks had to resort back to this, since the movie has so many strengths and so many great things that it could have built on. While the movie is still above average, it just isn't as superb as it could have been. Nonetheless, Strange Days succeeds on many levels and is well worth watching.  "},{"Title":"What a great movie!","Date":"26 March 2011","Score":"20 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" I had no idea this film even existed until it showed up in my Netflix 'recommended' column, and I decided to give it a shot after reading some good reviews on there. Wow, am I happy I did. This was a truly fantastic sci-fi thriller, with intense action and a truly engaging story. The characters were very well constructed and had a lot of substance to them, and of course the acting was superb. Who knew Ralph Finnes could play such a good lowlife?Set in an alternate (but totally recognizable) Los Angeles of 1999, the world has seemingly gone completely to hell, due to rampant poverty and class/racial tensions which are pushing society towards an all-out state of anarchy. The authorities are barely maintaining order, despite resorting to draconian measures to try and keep things in check. The director does an excellent job of painting this picture for us through fantastic environment and background shots which effectively build the tension and make us fully believe what is happening. In this world, they have invented a type of virtual reality which allows an individual to record everything they are seeing and feeling directly through their brain, so as to then be played back later through someone else's brain, which allows the user to then see and feel exactly what was recorded without any danger (other than possible addiction). So needless to say a huge black market has sprung up to provide people with recordings of all kinds of illicit, criminal and sexual activities that they'd never actually get to experience in the real world. The plot of the movie builds from this technology.However, other than this particular device and general state of social affairs, the alternate 1999 is pretty much identical to our 1999 (very much to it's credit). No flying cars, no wacky fashion, no aliens, no laser guns or anything like that. It was a great decision by the filmmakers to not bite off more than they could chew in that regard, as it would have distracted from a very solid story.The films weaknesses are few, but are there nonetheless. It was a bit long... although I'm not usually one to complain about that kind of thing, so long as the time is necessary to tell the story. In this case an argument can be made either way, though I personally feel they could have lost about fifteen minutes or so (but to me it's a minor issue).The director also felt the need to very quickly explain the origin of the virtual reality technology through a throwaway line of dialog, which really added nothing to the plot, and honestly made no sense; they said the technology was originally developed for the FBI so that informants wouldn't have to wear a wire, which is just dumb. The device is WAY more cumbersome and easily discoverable than a wire transmitter. How about saying that the military invented it to train soldiers more realistically? Or just leave it alone... true virtual reality is a technological holy grail. I don't think anyone questions why something like that would be invented in the first place, even if it's purely for entertainment.Additionally, in my opinion, a couple of the 'bad guys' could have had their motivations fleshed out a tad better, but that is a also very minor quibble. Beyond that, the look of the movie is quite dated, which could hinder the enjoyment for some people. The 1990's did not age very well to our eyes, and this movie is VERY much a product of that era. If you lived through it, you know what I mean. Younger viewers may not fully get the social and cultural allusions that this movie is built upon (Rodney King riots, 90's hip hop culture, rave clubs... things like that)... just something to keep in mind, although if you did live though it, you'll appreciate the depth that these references add.But really, I can't recommend this film highly enough. It's a completely under-appreciated piece of work, and one of the best sci-fi thrillers out there.

Even the best sci-fi movies (Blade Runner, Metropolis, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, etc) have moments that weaken the film's atmosphere due to hindsight whether it's the futuristic billboards advertising Pan Am or John Conner's Public Enemy t-shirt. But this film, which is almost two decades old, remains staggeringly fresh and oddly believable despite the film being set at the very death of the twentieth century. Maybe it's because the film isn't really about the millennium at all. It's actually a sweeping and ambitious neo-noir covering redemption, voyeurism, racial tensions and corruption. It might not tick all the boxes but I believe this film should go down as a stone-cold classic.December 30th, 1999 and business is good for smarmy deadbeat Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes). Ignoring the violence tearing society apart, Lenny peddles illegal mind-taps which record the memories and feelings of the person recording and allows users to replay them. But Lenny's position of influence in LA is at risk when he receives a blackjack - a snuff tape of a young woman being raped and murdered from the killer's point-of-view. Persuading his cop buddy Mace (Angela Bassett) and best friend Max (Tom Sizemore) to help him catch the sick killer, Lenny fears his ex-lover Faith (Juliette Lewis) could be next but she wants nothing to do with Lenny as she is busy cosying up to sleazy producer Philo Gant (Michael Wincott) in order to get her recording career off the ground.I can think of few films as well-made as Strange Days which does an incredible job of portraying a city where the plot is one of merely many stories happening concurrently. You feel part of the crowd as the streets explode into a vast party, ticker-tape raining down as cops chase suspects and violence breaks out at the drop of a party hat. You also completely buy into the concept of the SQUID device replaying the experiences of different people - indeed, it's hard to believe that it won't be long before it's patented in real life. Completing the film's powerful grip on your attention are the cast - Fiennes is convincingly slimy as Lenny, who'd rather offer his fake Rolex to avoid confrontation. By contrast, Bassett acts as the true hero and she displays an aura of confidence, determination and strength that Lenny sorely lacks. It's such a positive and refreshing change to see a black woman play the hero instead of the white male sidekick, something which sadly still doesn't seem to happen that often in Hollywood. But for me, the director Kathryn Bigelow deserves every bit of credit for a film which seems chronically under-rated but remains a solid and impressive piece of work.The only thing I didn't like was the very graphic sequences when the film switched to the brilliant first-person perspective and started butchering people. Of course, we have seen scenes of violence in movies for years but by bringing you into the action far better than a pair of 3D glasses ever will, the safety of the fourth wall has gone and it does make you feel uncomfortable. But technically, these sequences are a tour de force by Bigelow - utterly enthralling, brilliantly shot and completely believable, leaving me wondering exactly how they shot them. To be honest, I'm surprised no-one has thought of using the technology for an entire movie by now. It also runs out of steam towards the end and can't sustain the innovation throughout which is a pity, falling into genre stereotypes too easily. But overall, Strange Days is a truly magnificent picture. I'd forgotten how good it really is when I caught up with it yesterday and even though real life has obviously overtaken the events in the film, that shouldn't detract too much from what is a dark, imaginative and stunning piece of science-fiction cinema. And all this from the director of surfing bromance Point Break - who'd have thought it?

A mix of `Blade Runner' film noir and uncomfortable realism, `Strange Days' has the audacity to tackle some disturbing topics and to actually tell an interesting tale in the process.Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is a black market peddler of VR films - memory implants that are downloaded directly into the brain, allowing a person to vicariously sample someone else's experiences. The VR chips are like drugs, as people find the shared virtual experiences far better than those they find in their own lives.  Lenny, who's both dealer and addict, is jarred back into reality when one of his friends is killed in vicious fashion - and the experience is captured on a VR film.  Lenny comes to believe that his ex-girlfriend Faith (Juliette Lewis) may be next on the killer's list, so he begins his own search for the killer, partly to prevent anything bad from happening to Faith . . . and partly to impress Faith, and possibly win her back.Visually, `Strange Days' is terrific - it's hard to see how this film could be better in that department, even if James Cameron had directed the film himself.  Some of the shots are astounding, such as a point-of-view clip of a man running along a rooftop and jumping to his death, then another simple clip of a woman on a date . . . it's part of a VR film `sampling', one that gives the audience a taste of why the characters in `Strange Days' think the films are so real, and so voyeuristic.  Combine that with the way other things are filmed in `Strange Days' - the close-up look of Lenny's face as he samples past memories through VR films, the utter sweeping chaos of a riot as shot from high above - director Kathryn Bigalow creates a film that's visually mesmerizing.  The designers and special effects guys really went to town, and should be given full credit for creating an outstanding, memorable look for `Strange Days'.Ralph Fiennes is awesome as Lenny - he's scummy and underhanded enough to keep himself from ever being a true hero, but he imbues Lenny with enough affable charm and backbone to make him likeable nonetheless.  The rest of the cast falls short of Fiennes' great performance, though - Angela Bassett is decent as limo driver/armed muscle Mace, but Juliette Lewis is forgettable as Faith (and considering that she's supposed to be the love of Lenny's life, that drags the film down), and Tom Sizemore is more annoying than menacing as villain Max Peltier.  The story, while highly original, is uneven as well - certain plot points get abandoned for no reason, and sometimes the characters' motivations really don't make any sense at all, save to advance the story into the next scene.  The quick pacing of the film and its imaginative look help to gloss over these weaknesses, but they're still there, just the same.Inventive and daring, `Strange Days' is a solid movie, falling short of true greatness only because of the awkward execution of some brilliant ideas.  Still, it's very entertaining, and definitely worth viewing, especially if you're a fan of sci-fi films.

Not just for the audience, but for the actors and the people involved in the movies too. He even smashed the gender barrier in the world of action movies and gave us the toughest females ever (Sarah Connor, Ellen Ripley, Helen Tasker, and Lindsay Brigman). And in 1995 he wrote up a screenplay that had a really fascinating story about the impending millennium and he called it Strange Days. But instead of directing it, he decided to hand over the directing duties to his ex-wife Katheryn Bigelow, who made Point Break a few years before. And I've gotta say, women have really earned their place in action cinema, and we owe it to good ol' James Cameron.Strange Days tells the story taking place at the turn of the millennium from the 1000's to the 2000's and from 1999 to 2000. And due to the fact that it's a science fiction film, it features an outlawed device called SQUID that people can use with inserted discs to see, feel and experience an event that someone else already recorded. And a former cop named Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) who is now a hustler and seller of this device frequently uses the thing that he devotes his life to in order to experience the old memories of his ex-wife. And two other sub-plots emerge when he gets a disc that reveals corruption in the LAPD and another that shows a serial killer stalking, raping and murdering women. And it all finally converges at the end.Two years after playing the heartless Nazi Amon Goeth in Schindler's List, Ralph Fiennes shows a completely different side of him in here. His character Lenny Nero is basically a vulnerable, weak guy who happens to be a lying, deceiving and vain hustler and due to his occasional silliness, it's almost impossible to see the negative aspects of his personality. He's also quite stubborn and a fool for love since his ex-wife chose fortune and fame over him. And Fiennes was perfectly cast here due to his skill of conveying several personality traits into a character. Also, his character is somewhat unique since he isn't really as macho and he seems to be more feminine due to his clothing style of silk and spandex. And we all know we can't keep ripping-off other movie characters to be make a profit, and Strange Days does the opposite. It does what it should do to get originality.My favorite acting performance in here was, without a doubt, Angela Basset as Mace. We all know that James Cameron constantly puts tough female characters in his films, but Mace in Strange Days takes the cake! She serves as Lenny's bodyguard and provides a couple cool fight scenes. Mace used to be an average woman and then her husband got arrested and when he started doing time, Mace completely changed and became more masculine, kinda like Sarah Connor between the first two Terminator movies.Tom Sizemore, who is a Bigelow regular, is great as Lenny's best pal and Juliette Lewis is great as Nero's ex-wife and she provides a realistic portrayal as the hot woman who wants nothing but money and could care less for morality and love. She also does some great singing in a couple scenes when she's performing with her band. And the dirty cop Steckler played by Vincent D'Onofrio before his Law and Order days, is played flawlessly and he's a pretty scary guy and he's willing to do anything to cover up what he and his partner did (although I'm not gonna tell exactly what in this review, you'll have to watch and find out).Strange Days has got it all; action, science fiction, suspense, and romance. The SQUID things were really something cool, original and creative, and it would be even better if it was really invented someday. This isn't really as action-packed as James Cameron's movies tend to be like, since it's got a different director, but the vision of Los Angeles is just remarkable, there's arson fires and riots packed in almost every scene and its just horrifying. Even though it hasn't happened yet, it makes you think and it makes you worry, especially if you're foolish enough to be living in LA.And remember, a woman actually made one of the greatest action adventures of all time. Katheryn Bigelow, we salute you.

MILD SPOILERS !!!!I can imagine Kathryn Bigelow and James Cameron marching into the excutive offices with a movie idea . One of them pitches an ideas driven movie about virtual reality while the other pitches an old fashioned character driven thriller about a couple of corrupt cops wanting to get hands on evidence that will implicate them in a crime . The studio exec stratches his chin , can`t decide what movie he wants then has a sudden brain wave of merging the two plots into the same movie .That might have happened , it might not have happened but watching STRANGE DAYS I had the gut instinct that somewhere along the line someone had engineered the two above plots into the one movie . All through the running time I felt there were two screenplays trying to escape . Needless to say STRANGE DAYS starts to collapse under the  weight of its ideas . There`s also several more unnecessary sub plots  such as racial politics , rising crime levels and the mechanics of the music biz which by the end  don`t feel like they really belonged in this movie . Not only that they also add to an overlong running timeI awarded STRANGE DAYS 6 out of 10 . What stopped me from awarding it lower marks is the amount of kinetic energy director Bigelow has infused into the film , it`s by no means an unwatchable thriller despite its flaws and with a cast featuring Fiennes , Basset , Lewis , Sizemore , D`Onfrio and Fitchner at least there`s some well known character actors on display . Saome complained at the time that Cameron should have directed the movie instead of Bigelow , but there`s not much wrong with the directing unlike the script which was written by CameronHow`s this for a VR plot . A corrupt state frames a heroic and noble subversive by implanting memories of sexual abuse into the minds of children thereby framing the hero and jailing him as a child molestor . A deeply disturbing and adult premise for a sci-fi drama , and one that had been done before in the opening episode of BLAKE`S 7 . So you see the rather weak premise of STRANGE DAYS in comparison ?

The whole big revelation at the end is not a worthy compensation and much too obvious. Fiennes' character work is fine but the way the character is written makes him generically likable in a Spielberg kind of way and it put me off. Fiennes and Bassett just do not have any chemistry; I appreciate that it was pretty daring for them to have an inter-racial leading couple, but these particular actors didn't have it together. Bassett is one of those characters created in a petri dish by action movie screenwriters -- the single mom who takes care of her family and is also an expert at martial arts and killing people.As the movie proceeds at its agonizing pace towards the obvious and overblown ending, you can't help but suspect that the producer Jim Cameron probably planned to direct this film but bailed on that because he could tell that it just did not have the fundamentals of a good film. But much of the ephemeral stuff attached to the movie is equally onerous. I never saw the appeal of Juliette Lewis as an actress, but this film not only put her past her ability in that department but exposes us to not one but two solo performances of her bland alterna-rock singing. Combined with the weak flow by the supposed superstar rapper Jeriko (Glenn Plummer) that would have seemed stale in the early 80s, the movie is very terrible in terms of the music. In fact the strangest thing about the movie really is that it is set in 1999, so that it was outdated almost the moment when it came out. Yet it promised crazy technological advances in that 3 year span, not to mention riots and craziness that never happened on 12/31/99. So again, you have to think that the movie was supposed to be made in the late 80s or the early 90s and that it just took forever to produce it, to the point where they just pooped it out at the last minute. And that's about all you can say about the movie in the final analysis. Horrible supporting performances from Lewis and Tom Sizemore, mis-cast leads in Bassett and Fiennes playing characters far less interesting than they're capable of, a pointless and hackneyed cyberpunk story -- it's a major dud.p.s. not sure if anyone mentioned here, but the original script title for Blade Runner was Strange Days. Perhaps that was an homage, I don't know.

I'll avoid them assiduously. The plot, if you want to call it that, involves our hero, Feinnes, running around madly from party to party, getting thrown out of one place just to go back and get thrown out again. If you haven't figured out who done it within a half an hour, try something a little less complicated, say Little Red Riding hood. The premise that by slapping on the mind meld machine, usually worn under a wig, is promising. Have an orgasm, vicariously. Why not? But the plot abuses the idea to the point it becomes ludicrous, along with the acting, which is at all times, ludicrous, except for Angela Bassett. She acts her heart out trying to make this laughable movie work. To no avail. The continuity is nonexistent. In the final scenes, people are beaten, stabbed, shot and go on like little has happened. A good part of the movie is spent driving around in a Taurus limo. You know that car's gong to get blown up for sure. Who would use such a car unless they were on the cheap and didn't want to blow up a Caddy or Lincoln. Juliette Lewis,the temptress, attempts to be seductive as she sings, but it's more a tribal squat than a sexual gyration. Mr Feinnes, normally a fine actor, just looks either pained or pathetic as he tries to make us believe he's having an epiphany while wearing the brain beanie. Of course, it's hard to look post apocalyptic in 1995, when making a movie about 1999. We know what happened the night ushering in 2000. Nothing much. They have tired crews in the street, waiting for riots. The same poor people in the streets day after day. D'Onofrio's death scene was totally unbelievable, but that fit in. This thing dragged on for 2 1/2 hours. There wasn't enough substance for 30 minutes. Looking for a late night movie to put you to sleep? This will do the trick.

Even though I couldn't remember hardly any of this movie, there is little doubt not too far into the film who the killer is (and I swear I'm certain it's not because I knew it on some subconscious level). Still, knowing the identity of the villain didn't stop the story from being interesting, thought-provoking, and entertaining. The film is long, and definitely could have used some editing, but it's not interminable by any means. I must say that this particular dystopian future is not nearly as prescient as some reviewers seem to think, and the amount of things it gets right about 1999 don't amount to much. Look around and arguably we are actually currently living in a dystopian Sci Fi future, but it's unlike any predicted in any movie, and since we are fully immersed in it, we don't notice it anymore than a fish notices water--damn, that drone (I mean, quadraopoter) is annoying, no doubt my PC camera is spying on me, might as well say hi to the NSA while I'm at it, and after I get back from genetic testing next week for a medical problem, I think I'm going to order a little extra tin foil for my hat given the Amazon price that Google just popped up).

The movie starts out innocently enough -as Lenny shows different ways this technology can be used (eg become a woman, participate in armed hold ups, relive personal memories).  When things start turning sour (right before the new millennium) - Lenny's world comes crashing down all around him.  He begins to suspect that his ex-girlfriend will be the latest victim of a psychopathic killer - who is using the VR technology in sickening ways. Strange Days was co-written by James Cameron - thus it has a sci-fi, thriller feel to it.  I feel that Strange Days is a significant film of it's time - it captures the mood, feelings and angst at that time.  Also - it deals with the millennium bogeyman feeling that some had around the 90s. Strange Days is excellently directed by Kathryn Bigelow (a then ex-wife of Cameron) - there is a visual edge - the VR scenes are highlights. This movie is just so seat-squirmingly good - the VR scenes are graphic and are sometimes hard to take in.  You get an uncomfortable feeling that you are watching something which has already taken place in the past - you can't go and change it. This movie is both exciting, thrilling but I think its shock value makes it memorable in the long run.  I think this is a totally underrated flick - some might be put off by the inaccurate depiction of 1999 - but hey - this is sci-fi (emphasis on the fiction).

IMHO she is THE single best director running around in hollywood when it comes to the technical. But she also manages to slip in unusual angles for her shots and quite simply unusual techniques. But Strange Days isn't flawless, and to really enjoy it, it needs multiple viewings. I have so far seen it 3 times on a big screen, and about 3 or four times since I bought it on DVD, and I always manage to discover new things hidden away. It's this sense of subtlety that appeals to me most. And I finally figured out just why I have always found Strange Days the best film I ever saw. It took me a viewing of Citizen Kane, and the lecture on the POV scene on the DVD to really understand it Strange Days is like a perfect Choreography of film. Every part stands in perfect relation to another. Be it the acting, directing music and every other thing that makes a movie. And together they easily wipe out the slightly weaker sci-fi premise of the film.

Cameron knows how to write a great story that,whilst entertaining, provokes thought and reaction; his skill at creating such interesting characters is his real strong point. Kahryn Bigelow, is a very accomplished director and displays her creative imagination and talent for moving the film along at a fast pace. Bigelow is so effective because she gives films soul and relies more on just visual imagery to make a good film. Although not as good as Near Dark, Strange Days is definitely one of Bigelow's finest achievements and it is great to see two such talented film makers collaborate.The cast is flawless. Ralph Fienns as always, puts on a terrific performance and was definitely the right choice to lead the cast. From the outside, his character is so cool and and charismatic, yet once the audience gets to know Lenny, we find that he is a vulnerable, lowlife hustler who can hardly protect himself, let alone anyone else. Fiennes really excels at showing Lenny's vulnerable side and his acting whilst he is plugged in is fantastic. Fiennes performance however, is not the best. That label definitely goes to Angela Bassett as Mace. The character is so full of bad ass attitude but also is very sensitive and loving. Bassett gives an amazing performance acting a character based on opposite extremes and is really great to watch. Juliette Lewis gives the film its sexuality. Her sexy good looks and excitable personality make her perfect for the role of Faith. Her stage presence is very good and her singing is a perfect match for the type of band her character is in.The soundtrack is very strong and definitely gives Strange Days a 'CyberPunk' feel. The songs featuring Lewis are the strongest tracks as they reflect the personality of the film; dirty and loud. There is a good mix of rock music and techno which is at a furious pace, just like what is occurring on picture. The music is used as part of the film rather than something that runs alongside it.Although starting a little slowly, Strange Days develops in to a feast for the eyes and imagination. One scene in particular is very shocking and disturbing to the point it makes you feel ill but it is so powerful and uncompromising that it snatches your attention. The idea to shoot the virtual reality scenes in first person was a very good idea as it feels so personal and almost makes the audience feel that they are wired in themselves.A contemporary Sci-Fi classic, Strange Days delivers on every front and shows what can happen when all the ingredients for a good film are put in place.

Leonetti) to the terrific editing job by Howard Smith (and an uncredited James Cameron) and even down to the production and costume design (by Lilly Kilvert and Ellen Mirojnick respectively) this is a film where, for me at least, everything works, not least of which are the acting itself which is almost flawless right down the line.Angela Bassett and especially Ralph Fiennes are as close to perfect as casting and characters get, both delivering superb performances (and how) full of genuine character and depth. Costars Tom Sizemore, Michael Wincott, Brigitte Bako and especially Juliette Lewis all also deliver terrific performances, while Vincent D'onofrio, Richard Edson, William Fichtner and Todd Graff all contribute positively and Glenn Plummer, Nicky Katt, Michael Jace, Louise LeCavalier, Malcolm Norrington, Joe Urla, Josef Sommer, Jim Ishida, David Carrera and Anais Munoz round out the cast nicely.Special note must also be made of the fantastic use of music in the film, from the score itself by Graeme Revell and Deep Forest, to the suitably pumping soundtrack which amongst others contains two terrific interpretations of the P.J. Harvey songs 'Rid Of Me' and 'Hardly Wait', both sung with surprising gusto and effectiveness by Juliette Lewis, and underpinning the mood of the film perfectly. The use of music here is a shining example of how a well planned combination of score and music can be used to not only complement each other but also the film itself and be used as a very effective tool for underlining the drive and power of a film.Strange Days is dark and even at times (justifiably) a touch disturbing, during one particular scene especially, but for those that enjoy superbly crafted, intelligent, in your face sci-fi thrillers that aren't afraid to walk the dark path it doesn't get much better than this, and as such is very highly recommended.10/10 One Man's Opinion.

As midnight, December 31st, 1999 approaches, tensions are running high.  An altogether new kind of drug is taking over the streets.  A narcotic of technology, it enables people to live someone's recorded experience.  This isn't like, 'TV, only better.'  The user experiences the action as if they were living it.  This allows the user to experience everything from sexual fantasies to the adrenaline rush of charging into a convenience store, weapon in hand, without any of the consequences.One of the wonderful things about Strange Days is that it succeeds on so many different levels.  First, it is an intelligent and thought-provoking science fiction film, in which the technology doesn't serve merely as the backdrop for a stylized action film, but is integral to the plot and the theme.  The technology concept wasn't new to Strange Days--visionary sci-fi writer William Gibson used the idea of recorded memories as entertainment in his groundbreaking, brilliant and extraordinarily influential Cyberspace trilogy --but the film handles it with great intelligence.  It poses the questions, What is the value of real experience vs. memories or movies? And how are we, as audience members, complicit in the actions and events we witness?Secondly, the film is a gripping mix of action and mystery, directed with a terrific sense of momentum by Kathryn Bigelow.  From its tour-de-force first-person perspective opening sequence until its poetically beautiful final image, the film never ceases to propel its story forward and remain visually inventive and interesting throughout.Thirdly, and, of course, most importantly, the film is populated by fascinating characters who are played by wonderful actors, and the film never loses its human element amidst the technology and action.  The film's anti-hero, Lenny Nero, is played with great intelligence and complexity by talented British actor Ralph Fiennes.  Lenny is a dealer in clips, as the discs containing the recorded memories are called.  A wonderful introductory scene shows Lenny cruising down Hollywood Boulevard in his Mercedes, eating a sandwich and conducting business on his carphone a la Typical Uncaring Movie Drugdealer, oblivious to the acts of violence he's cruising past or the calls of panic on the talk-radio station he's tuned in to as the new millenium is less than two days away, while the effective techno-global Deep Forest soundtrack serves as counter-point to the action.  Later on, though, in a priceless scene, we find that Lenny hasn't completely lost the kindness he possessed as a police officer, as he gives a friend who has lost both legs a clip he had specially made of running along the beach and getting a smile and a hi from an attractive woman.Lenny is a rather pathetic man, an addict as well as a pusher of his drug. Rather than living his real life, he chooses to constantly re-live his own recorded memories of happier times with his ex-girlfriend Faith, played by Juliette Lewis.  Faith, an aspiring singer, has left Lenny for big-time music industry executive Philo Gant (bad guy in every movie made 1991-1997 Michael Wincott), whose record label represents rapper Jeriko-One, an angry and powerful voice for the black community who proclaims, as the new year approaches, 2K is upon us.  History will end, and begin again.    Angela Bassett gives a pressure cooker of a performance as Mace, Lenny's friend who struggles to snap him out of the past, and Tom Sizemore, a consistently interesting actor best known as Tom Hanks' friend Horvath in Saving Private Ryan, is great here as Max, a buddy of Lenny's from his days on the police force.Strange Days is, in a sense, a mystery, and to say too much about the plot would be to give some things away.  Suffice it to say that the characters become entangled in a web of murder and deceit and, by the time the truth of the crime is revealed, it is also revealed that almost everyone's desires and motivations are more complex than we initially thought.  The scene in which Lenny finally tracks the killer down and the truth is revealed is a doozy, a nifty verbal sparring match between two skilled actors in top form. Ultimately, the film carries us over the brink and into the new millenium, providing us with an image of poetic beauty that nicely ties up the film's ongoing concern with issues of race.  The film goes into darker places than most films go, and still manages to be positive and uplifting in the end, a story of hope and redemption, and miraculously, thanks to the skill with which it's written, directed and acted, it doesn't feel the least bit cliched or forced in its journey.A word of warning Strange Days has disturbing moments, and one crime is particularly chilling.  Some people argued that this particular scene was overly gratuitous.  I don't believe this is the case.  Rather, I think it is through this scene that the film explores one of the most interesting and complex issues it poses.  In the scene, Lenny, as well as the audience, watches a clip, a first person record of a particularly brutal murder. Lenny is positively repulsed by the clip, and we are meant to be as well. Typically, when we go to an action film, we are allowed the luxury of feeling distanced from the loss of human life occuring on screen, if we're not meant to downright cheer and rejoice.  In this scene in Strange Days, by putting us in the killer's position, James Cameron (the film's story developer and co-screenwriter) and Bigelow are implicating us in the on-screen action, preventing us that luxury of feeling distanced and forcing us to consider the action in a much more direct and immediate way.  Why does Lenny refuse to deal in blackjack clips (snuff films?)  Probably because he believes that the purchasers and viewers of such clips are not completely free of responsibility for the crimes they are watching.In a way, it's a shame that Titanic looms so large, because, while that's certainly a fine film, Strange Days is Cameron's true masterpiece of the decade, but in the public eye it will always be obscured by the big boat.

This film had all that I wanted from an action/mystery thriller. With an amazing cast (particularly Fiennes) and some explosive action, Strange Days was a sordid journey into an alternate universe. (spoilers) Every character was fascinating, and the FPV scenes were the best I've seen in films. Fiennes plays an ex-cop turned squib dealer (squibs are the virtual reality drug of the future) who finds himself caught in intrigue and danger after a friend of his is killed.

I worked at a video store for a few years, so for eight hours a day I was watching movies. I saw this one in the theater, with an advanced screening pass my then-girlfriend got us. She ended up liking the movie, and my detest for it probably didn't help our relationship which was on shaky ground and dissolved a month later. One of the main reasons I want to express my opinion of this movie here is due to the positive review that it has on All Movie Guide. I can hardly believe that whoever wrote that review saw the same cut that I did. Usually All Movie Guide doesn't have much trouble giving bad reviews to terrible movies, but in this case they dropped the ball. But anyway, back to Strange Days...One of the things that bothered me early on in this movie was the fact that it was all a disappointment after the first 5 minutes. The first 5 minutes, with the extremely innovative first-person sequence with no cuts is an amazing adrenaline rush, so I was prepared to love this movie. I was even prepared to forgive it if it couldn't quite live up to its first 5 minutes, but it didn't just not live up to its potential, it turned out to be a complete turkey.The plot is interesting, but unfortunately we've got Ralph Fiennes as a lead, doing his shoddy American accent. Accompanying him is a black woman limo driver who freaks out and nearly kills her 'friend', (Fiennes' character) because he puts his 'SQUID' unit on in the back of her car. This scene is probably there to make the viewer equate SQUID with heroin or crack, as if that silly comparison hadn't already been alluded to several times by that point. Her flip out over SQUID use is as comical as when Fiennes' character unknowingly begins viewing a 'blackjack' tape on his SQUID unit, which causes him to writhe in pain (but he continues watching), even though the apparatus supposedly works by giving you the feelings of the person who recorded/lived the event. Since the person who made it was obviously enjoying it, shouldn't the SQUID unit be subjecting Fiennes character to pleasurable feelings when he views the blackjack? But no, since this is Hollywood schlock, the audience is supposed to put a cognitive moral band-aid over this plot-hole and feel sympathetic for Fiennes for having to be put though the sordid experience of viewing the blackjack flick.Now, even if a 'morally upright' naive citizen who views a blackjack clip gets feelings of disgust from viewing it, Fiennes character is supposed to be an ex-cop, an 'on the edge' sort, living in a dystopian future, who certainly should've seen plenty of gory violence close up on the job by now, and has no reason to be writhing around like you might expect a hapless Amish person to do if accidentally exposed to a blackjack clip via SQUID...The only mildly interesting character in this movie is Fiennes' character's cyber-geek buddy who lives in a van. Unfortunately he dies right away, so he's unable to help save this movie at all.Watching Juliette Lewis stumble through this mess while hanging off that weird hippie guy with the unbuttoned shirt to display his greasy shaved chest was disturbing and boring, as well.Then the 'sub-plot' of the messianic rapper being gunned down by LAPD Rodney King-beater stereotypes amounted to a mini-farce of its own. The scene where the rapper is pulled over and the discussion with the cops who inevitably shoot him is so contrived and clichéd its cringe-worthy. I very much doubt any black people ever worked on this script. But one thing is for sure - whoever worked on this script and green-lighted it shouldn't be allowed near a film production ever again!There are a million more things wrong with this movie, but fortunately I haven't seen it come on TV in a few years so it's not fresh in my mind. The 20-minute long millennium party scene at the end and the unbelievably clichéd false endings where the villain keeps coming after being shot a dozen times, falling down, dying, and somehow reviving himself to be killed again, caps off this inane excuse for sci-fi. I can't imagine this thing getting positive reviews from anybody but the most sheltered Christian Luddites, but it does. The makers of this film had a plot they could've done something interesting with, but instead they decided to tell a comical tale of cautionary morality and righteousness. This movie is in the same league as Battlefield Earth; as nonsensical and convoluted as Battlefield Earth is, is how simplistic and unoriginal Strange Days is, and both movies are equally unrewarding.

Set in a near future, the story deals with classic themes like virtual reality, thought control or the share of memory, providing and exciting and engaging cyberpunk adventure. Director Kathryn Bigelow creates a futuristic LA that manages to be both sophisticated and believable, avoiding the over-the-top, Utopian and not very realistic depictions of future societies presented in other sci-fi films. Although Strange Days is basically a thriller, it is way above many run-of-the-mill movies of its genre, as it succeeds at combining its key elements perfectly. The direction is dynamic, unique and fast-paced, adding style and energy with an excellent sense of rhythm, flow and tension. The acting is also a plus, since Ralph Fiennes is unforgettable as the flawed anti-hero Lenny and Angela Basset shines as his sister-in-arms Mace. This duo makes for an odd, yet original and memorable couple, delivering some enticing and moving scenes. It's also interesting seeing the female character protecting the male for a change, making for a clever reverse of the predictable and typical scenario of most action flicks. Juliette Lewis is also convincing as the dark and feral femme-fatal, especially when she sings a P.J. Harvey song to perfection (one of the many excellent and remarkable moments of this movie).The only problem is the script, which in its determined liberalism (the LAPD isn't really rife with racism, oh no, it's just a couple of loose cannons here and there) is at odds with the basically scary premise. In the end, it relies on the concept of The Good Cop and Real Love Conquering All. I don't suppose it could've been any other way, but...really.Although I am a fan of thrillers and sci-fi, a good story (giving the viewer a range of feelings and emotions) regardless of the genre is what truly sells to a wide audience. I believe that Strange Days is a good story told extremely well by the director, Kate Bigelow, using film.Overall rating 8 out of 10.

This sci-fi thriller is very suspenseful and tackles many topics connected to today. I was moved by the portrayal of of cop relations with African-Americans. Just having it being represented in this film shows that police brutality has been a recurring issue for quite some time. This film is reminiscent of George Orwell's novel 1984 in the since that it is foretelling of the future if technology and power structures are not kept under control. However, I feel that the portrayal of the squibs was a little corny. I Other than that, I found it to be a pretty decent film.

That's the premise for STRANGE DAYS! We are in L.A. at 30th December of 1999 and the new millennium is about to begin. In the black-market you can buy a new drug which can drive you into POV experiences of other people's lives, seeing, hearing and feeling what that person recorded. And it could be anything, from someone making sex, running at the beach, making an assault or even the blackjacks violations, murders and even the death of the person who was recording! That's a voyeuristic kind of experience but also an addiction that could be easily compared to a drug...But that's just the premise of the movie, and the most interesting part of it in my opinion (In fact I watched this film for the first time back in 1996 and that was the only thing I remembered from it...). So the 2000's new years eve and this new drug are just the context to what is in fact an action thriller about cops, the abuse of authority, and the tension between cops and black people in L.A...I enjoyed the movie, but also the soundtrack! It has some nice kicking rock songs of the 90's (including the ones sung by Juliette Lewis!) and it made me feel like 20 years ago listening to those songs. The acting is also fine, especially from Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett. I score it 7/10.

Brand new at the literal turn of the century this highly addictive and as of yet unattainable type of Virtual Reality takes over the city. One in which Adrenaline junkies get addicted to the high of living vicariously through the memories of other people. Dealers deal hardware and clips. The story follows Nero, one such dealer. While there are difficulties with the plot this film forces us to live the reality of that which entertains us. Rather than inundating the audience with random acts of violence as simple entertainment, we are forced to recognize individual acts of violence as memories in people's real lives. We are able to see our own death through the eyes of our killer. This Virtual Reality experience highlights the sordid reality of what entertains us as people.

It plays on a lot of people's fears about the end of the world and conspiracy theories, especially back then with the uncertainty of ringing in the new millennium. With that out of the way, I found the concept of being able to record memories and loading them onto disks to be shared to be very intriguing because of the possibilities for asynchronous communication. While not being able to communicate instantaneously, it should be noted that the sharing of memories and even physical sensations gave users the sense of looking through another person's eyes (or living in another man's shoes). The film's take on virtual reality was something I'd never seen before played out. As seen in the film, this can and was easily abused, being illegally marketed in the form of a digital drug and using them as surveillance to spy on people.

You put on a device that covers the top of your head, insert a disc and it plays an experience that someone else had...but you see it through their eyes and hear it too.

I first saw it up a theatre in stereo on a large screen and it blew me away. The imagery is incredible (excellent direction by Kathryn Bigelow) and the sound mix inventive. The movie isn't easy to watch at times--there's a VERY graphic sequence where a woman is tortured, raped and murdered--but it is needed for the plot. The plot is involved but I was never confused. The acting is, for the most part, great. Fiennes is great and Bassett is just incredible. They're both great actors and give their all to this. Tom Sizemore has a small role and he's pretty good. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as an ex of Lenny. Very wooden. The only real bad thing is the climax--it goes on for far too long (this movie doesn't have to run 145 minutes). This was lost back in 1995 and didn't even become known when director Bigelow won an Oscar for The Hurt Locker--but it deserves recognition. Well worth seeing.

Set about four years after it was released (1995, i believe) its world is a close future in which Los Angeles is being torn apart by race riots and police brutality - all washed down with a hedonistic population clamouring for new sensations.Here we find the science-ficiton device. The SQUID prosthesis which allows peoples experiences to be recorded, reproduced and sold on the black market for people to experience for themselves. The story follows Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) into an intriguing and disturbing detective story centring on a murder recorded by one of these devices. Not only does the film flesh itself out with violence, car chases, and a pretty massive party but, through its use of the SQUID device, it allows for a good detective story to ask interesting questions about bodily experience - and the nature of that when it becomes recordable (turned into information) and sellable - when it becomes currency. So where is there fault with this film? (7*?) Well there isn't much really. At times the film's 'bad guy' seems to become that 90s villain we've seen so many times. And I think the plot-twist and the ending were both rather forced(but this is pretty big-budget stuff, so...). I could go on and list things which I think could have been better about the film but that would be not only useless but arrogant. This is a great film which, despite falling into a few of the usual traps, deals with some interesting themes and is very enjoyable to watch (and has some alright music in it too) - This is a film of its time which is defiantly worth watching.

The film is an elaborate adult sci-fi thriller (lasting nearly 2½ hours) taking place on the last two days of the 20th century &#x96; considering the technological quandary that characterized that period, one could well dub this Apocalypse Noir! The ambitious plot line is complemented by striking visuals in fact, what we have here is a mix of low-life and hi-tech where media gurus, corrupt cops and losers yearning for redemption all find themselves embroiled in the futuristic concept of 'memory disks' being utilized as a thrill-seeking experience (though 'receptionists' tend to over-react at the ensuing images!). The whole, then, is well-served by a roster of top acting talent led by Ralph Fiennes (atypically but effectively cast as the illicit provider of virtual gratification for a sensation-seeking public), Angela Bassett (embodying what in noir terms is referred to as a tough broad), Juliette Lewis (in characteristic bad-girl mode) and Tom Sizemore (again, the perennial wacko), but also highlighting Michael Wincott, Vincent D'Onofrio and William Fichtner &#x96; ensuring one hell of a ride that is alternately gloomy, thought-provoking and fun. Undermining the reasonably impressive end result is the film's inherently unsavory nature and the fact that it goes off-the-rails at the climax; however, reading up on the film just now, I have to say that I was shocked to see no less an authority than David Thomson dismiss STRANGE DAYS as one of the loudest bad movies ever made when, personally, I think it is a vastly underrated work deserving of major cult status!

Many feel 2000 will mark the end of the world - sound familiar? - but as we now know, 9/11 hadn't happened yet, and the date of the Rapture has been moved yet again.Ralph Fiennes is Lenny Nero, an ex-cop turned bootlegger dealing in illegal squid recordings - virtual-reality type tapes actually made from the cerebral cortex so that the viewer experiences true emotions as if the viewer were actually there. Lenny depends on a friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) while he still loves his ex-girlfriend, a singer named Faith (Juliette Lewis).

Both Fiennes and Bassett are fantastic, and it would be hard to say which one is better. Bassett gives new meaning to the words girl power and Fiennes somehow makes his sleazoid character likable and sad.

This is a flashy, self-indulgent world in which the main character really has no reason to good besides his own humanity. On many levels he is just a greasy used car salesman, but at the core, he still values life. He cares that some roadkill prostitute dies and that some homicidal maniac is on the loose. He is a loser, and everything that has happened in his life should have made him as unfeeling and brutal as the killer, but he's not...the most important parts of his character and humanity are still intact amongst all the mindless hedonism.

It could become a cult film in a few years time given the right audience but otherwise it will slip into obscurity. Which is a shame because this is certainly the equal of any other recent Sci-Fi Film and is certainly more coherent than both the Matrix sequels.Fienes is a very credible lead, both Sizemore and Lewis are up to their usual high standards. In fact given the quality of the cast and the film itself it's surprising that it is not more well known.It's difficult to put a finger on why the film falls just short of being great. At times the pacing of the film just seems a little off, the twist at the end feels heavy handed and somehow you just never get a real immersion into the world created as you do in truly great SF films.Overall if you like Sci-Fi films and haven't already seen this, see it now as a must see.

How often do we get a film that challenges us in so many ways? Not often enough, I think. James Cameron co-wrote the screenplay and produced the film. Cameron has been a leading force in great scifi films and his credits include The Terminator, Terminator 2 and The Abyss as well as Aliens, his entry in that highly successful franchise. Cameron understands that while special effects are wonderful, interesting characters are even better. Strange Days gives us one of the most intriguing anti-heroes in modern film.The main character is Lenny, a drug dealer of the future. His drug isn't your usual one, but one that allows you to visualize another person's experiences..in their eyes. He's not overtly heroic or even nice for that matter, but he isn't exactly evil. Take away the modern details and you'd have your regular Hitchcockian everyman.I don't want to give away some of the wonderful surprises in this film, but I'll just say this...I didn't much like the ending. God, I'm sick of these happy endings where all problems are solved by one kiss. For some films, this can work. But not in a visionary, intelligent and exciting thriller like Strange Days. ***1/2 out of 4 stars "},{"Title":"Flawed but fantastic.","Date":"23 April 2001","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Although many aspects of the film seem dated (which was inevitable being made so close to the millennium and now being looked at in hindsight) it still succeeds in the way the best movies should - visually, aurally and emotionally.A lot of James Cameron's dialogue for Ralph Fiennes is rubbish, especially the so-called wisecracks and humorous moments.  What makes Lenny identifiable and interesting is his feeling of loss for his ex, and his evolution from being a cowardly, self-pitying scumbag to a reluctant hero.Angela Bassett is great as Mace, the one truly level-headed and strong character in the film, self-reliant and totally capable (saving Ralph's bacon a few times).  Juliette Lewis is totally believable as a wannabe rock star (check her energy in the stage scenes) and adds the film's sauce in a top scene where Lenny plays back old memories which consist of her rollerblading in skimpy gear then stripping off - result!The music is good as well, with a nice mix of Deep Forest, Skunk Anansie, Tricky, Marilyn Manson etc. which suits the film perfectly.  The film's visual style is derivative of Blade Runner (it's futuristic L.A. filmed at night) but colors and camera angles used give it an appealing style of it's own.What really makes the film, however, is the whole final New Year's Eve sequence, featuring murderous cops, helicopters, tall buildings, fireworks, guns, knives and a huge amount of confetti.  The scenes between Fiennes and Bassett are very emotional (helped by the top score), and it makes me wish my millennium went like that (without the bloodshed).RECOMMENDED!

No fallout or destruction, no nuclear waste of desert civilization. But total chaos and a destruction of humanity. As Max says in the film, there's nothing left to do so the world is inevitably over. This film was a very realistic prediction of the possibilities around the false millenium, fortunately the bolder predictions failed to come true, but many of the smaller predictions were just as lamentably right on (rising gas prices, elementary school shootings, police brutality as well as a collective whine that police aren't doing enough while handcuffing them so that they can't do anything...) As well, with computers taking over social intercourse, perhaps 'playback' isn't far behind&#133;This is undeniably one of James Cameron's finest stories, and most likely the last of the good ones. I read the original story behind the script, and it was quite different (combining of some characters, splitting others, elimination of certain scenes, adding others) but the changes he made for the shooting script did everything to help the film and nothing to harm it. And Kathryn Bigelow's brilliant direction has turned Strange Days into a neo-classic masterpiece! Better than all of her other films combined (no mean feat, as Near Dark is an excellent cult classic, and Point Break combined Keanu and Swayze in a *good* film - who thought that was even *possible*...!!) this film has vision. And the combined nihilism and realism make for one scary vision.The cast make a great movie better. Ralph Fiennes is amazing as always, and I just can't say enough about Angela Bassett she was created for this role!! She is absolutely incredible in all ways, creates character, exudes charisma, is strong and sultry, and looks good in a uniform!!;)And the cinematography is nothing short of brilliant, especially the playback scenes; brilliantly shot, and brilliantly executed. The rape scene gave me shudders, harsh and brutal but it fit with the film and wasn't overly graphic or explicit; and even the opening robbery scene gave a bit of an adrenaline rush when he fell.And while we're at it...KILLER soundtrack!! Wow oh wow! I got it after originally seeing the film and listen to it regularly, but that aside, it fits absolutely hand-in-glove with the film.So what are the downsides? Because this film is amazing, but definitely not a perfect ten. And the main reason is Juliette Lewis. I *HATE* Juliette Lewis. And she isn't much better here. She whines. She moans. She whines. She moans. And she *sings* (lord help us all, who's bright idea was it to let her open up her chords. She's practically ruined PJ Harvey for me...and I *love* PJ Harvey). Not to mention that when she takes her shirt off she looks like a twelve year old! Brooke Shields was more developed in Pretty Baby and she was TEN!Juliette aside, the ending killed it for me. If any film deserved to lack a Hollywood ending it was this one. The cheezy suicide/killing of the cops was bad enough, but Bigelow should have ended it with Lenny looking back at the car...to have them kiss was just trite.And finally too long! 2h25  is just too much. Should have been 2 hours, 2h15 at the utmost.OVERALL even Juliette and the cheezy ending couldn't bring this movie down. It just plain rocks. Great story, better directing, stellar cast. Without the ending it would be a nine, without Juliette a ten. As it stands, 8/10.

It is the first person perspective of parts of this film that make it stand out initially, there are no other films that do this, it instantly reminded me of the Smack My Bitch Up video of the Prodigy, yet more hellish, the rape scenes are truley look away from the screen awful, not so much because they are so graphic, but because of the way they are shown, in this first person perspective. It is a kind of cross between 8mm and Matrix yet better then both. The visuals are stunning, but not in your face and not taking away from the subject of the film. It always saddens me to read some of the reviews for films such as this, although the majority of people give this film a glowing review, some it seems are too prejudiced against the film because of its content. It is people like this that prevent such great films such as Strange Days been seen by as many people as it deserves. This film is in no way gratuitus in the violence it portrays, the first person view does not encorage or encite, as is often the argument with video games of the same perspective, instead it revolts and horifies, serving to make rape more abhorable than has been managed in any film before.The near future presented in Strange Days also seems remarkably real, i suppose it was only looking five years into the future, however the millenium celebration scene looks as though it was filmed live at the millenium, and provides a fantasic ending for the film. I have just ordered this film on DVD and would recomend anyone else to do the same, or get it on video (its only 6 quid) you really will not regret it.

I was staggered by how good it was, because I just hadn't heard of Strange Days at all.  How can such a good film have passed me by when it was released only 5 years ago?After watching the film I was moved to look it up on the imdb.  I was not surprised at all to find that the director is Kathryn Bigelow, also responsible for what I believe to be two other mightily underrated pieces of work, namely Point Break and the TV mini-series Wild Palms.  The latter of these and Strange Days share an interest in how VR technology might be used in the future.Wild Palms looks very much at the broadcast side of things and how the media might be used and abused, while Strange Days investigates how such technology might be used and abused at a personal level.  A cynical current runs through both pieces with a pretty pessimistic outlook on how society will 'embrace' VR technology.Strange Days has a feel far less radical than say Blade Runner, but yet subtly manages to convey the sci-fi edge to the unfolding drama.  I like sci-fi which is grounded in a reality with which I can easily identify, and although my one and only visit to LA was not punctuated by civil unrest, I feel this film does a pretty good job.  This might turn out one day to be prophetic. but even if it doesn't it will not lessen the impact of the film.Some of the scenes are difficult to watch, but absolutely nothing is gratuitous, each one contributing to the depth of despair.  If there is one complaint I have about the film, it is the implausible ending, which feels like it has been appended by someone other than the director.  But even that doesn't detract from a film which goes into my list of films to buy on the basis of one viewing, and that list of mine is only about 30 films long.

The movie doesn't really know what it wants to be - cyberpunk noir? standard murder mystery? love story? end of the millennium apocalyptic cautionary tale? It tries a little of everything and doesn't really do anything that well. One of the main problems is that none of the characters we're supposed to like are very likable and the rest are just excessively weird and annoying (i.e. Philo Gant and his goons) for no apparent reason. Overacting is rampant, as the characters are constantly in situations that strain the limits of credulity. For example, the whole scene where the cops shoot Jeriko One borders on laughable. There were just a lot of scenes where the characters' words and actions did not seem to make sense. The movie seems to try to compensate for its lack of narrative cohesion by being as kinetic and loud as possible, which wears on your nerves after awhile. And what's with the whole New Year's Eve party thing at the end? It's the end of the millennium, great.

Everything feels sluggish, the editing, the speed the actors talk, it all feels dragged out. Even the action scenes feel languorous, although a couple are decent, most notably an early chase through a subway station. Some action scenes use slow motion just to make things feel even slower.The movie fails to generate suspense when it attempts to, and about the only consistent emotion it elicits is unpleasantness.The direction reminds me of the similarly slow and unpleasant films of William Friedkin, so it might appeal to those who can stand his stuff.The script is quite dumb. The action of Fiennes is pretty good, but only Bassett rises above her material with a powerful performance that deserves a better movie. Lewis varies between okay and really bad. For Lewis fanatics Strange Days will be worth seeing just because she wanders through the movie in various stages of undress. There's an interesting hoarse-voiced performance by the guy who plays Lewis's boyfriend/manager that I couldn't decide on, was it cool or did he sound a bit too much like an over-the-top pirate?

Ten years later, Bigelow's mastery of the Steadicam remains unsurpassed, thanks in part to Cameron's slick incorporation of it into the script as a flashback vehicle. The Steadicam facilitates Bigelow's meta-critique of film itself, reminding us that the reflective, repetitive, regressive, and spectral qualities of movie-watching should always strike us as uncanny.Cameron and Bigelow paint Los Angeles as a comic-book dystopia. Families, like the sun itself, are long forgotten&#151;superannuated in the rat race for mental and physical space by endless nightclubs, flaming garbage cans, tanks on every corner, a perennial low-lying haze, and cybernetic recordings of the human relationships that once were.Foremost amongst these is Lenny and Faith's lost love. Lenny's cave of an apartment lacks the space or light for viable habitation and functions now only as his solitary screening room. In the film's only elysian scene, Lenny tries to slip back into an era that still knew light and love by replaying a clip on the beach with Faith. But Bigelow's relentless counter-cutting back to shots of him wearing the SQUID underline the untenability of Lenny's retrograde relationship with the past. Later that night, Faith will excoriate him You know one of the ways movies are still better than playback? 'Cuz the music comes up, there's credits, and you always know when it's over. It's over! A few technicalities about Bigelow's climax hint at the richness of this auteur's achievement (warning spoilers follow) By emphasizing its qualities of mirroring, doubling, and Deja Vu, Bigelow pushes the SQUID's potential for uncanny cinema step-by-step to its logical conclusion, ultimately laying bare playback's emptiness as Lenny's way of life. Rife with the terms of his own demise, Lenny's past ultimately collapses in on him as the world plummets towards its own midnight apocalypse. In their dimensions of time and space, and in their featured characters, the clips grow hotter and hotter on Lenny's trail. The implosion of his universe climaxes in his apoplectic playback of Max's apparent snuff clip of Faith. By thematically conflating two previous clips (that of Lenny with Faith and the snuff clip of Iris), Bigelow uses the new clip to impose on Lenny (and the viewer, of course) the uncanny horror of the familiar recast in brutally unfamiliar terms. Ever the uncanny hermeneutic device, the mirror betrays Lenny's own best friend and former partner Max as his (back-stabbing, as we will see) Judas. Meanwhile, the bend in the mirror furnishes the double reflection that characterizes Max as Janus-faced. Bigelow underscores Max's two faces by shock inter-cutting amongst frontal medium closeups, frontal tight closeups, and profile closeups of Max, all without the customary reverse shots. Bigelow once again defies cinematic convention to infuse nightmarish suffocation into her own heart of darkness Los Angeles on the eve of the millennium. (Hollywood anxiety, anyone?)Finally recognizing own life literally hanging in the balance, Lenny Nero (as Los Angeles burns) renounces thralldom to yesteryear He cuts his tie&#151;which he once told Max was the one thing that stands between me and the jungle--and with it he cuts his ties to a dysfunctional past. Viewed in the retrospect of this vertiginous climax, Bigelow's opening shot now reads as a direct quotation of Hitchcock's Vertigo. Like Hitchcock, Bigelow opens by diving into the retinal black hole of the mind's eye, and like him, she climaxes with a precipitous fall. But Cameron and Bigelow are more generous than Hitch. Whereas the latter stranded his protagonist like a crucified Jesus atop the bell tower, Lenny survives his Judas into a new millennium of love. But Lenny's destiny can only be found deep within the thronging heart of darkness, where, in Bigelow's final shot, his true self and true love are illuminated by fireworks announcing the next thousand years of humankind.

Where to begin in explaining its awfulness? Is it the ridiculously outdated premise? The ugly misogyny permeating the whole project? The constipated acting from an embarrassed looking all-star cast? The whole silly Y2K hysteria? The overdone, over-the-top pretentious nihilism? Aside from Ralph Fiennes, everyone's career was derailed (permanently or temporarily) after this fiasco, certainly Angela Bassett, who probably wants to erase the existence of this film from her resume (along with SUPERNOVA). She was a rising star in the mid-90s. Hyped as the next big thing. She even had a couple of successes between this and SUPERNOVA, but her bad choices in starring in overblown B-movies like this one rapidly deflated her star-power and she never became the leading actress everyone thought she would become.The funniest thing of this overdone film is the science-fiction aspect. The concept of recording one's memory and experiences via technology is nothing new (BRAINSTORM) and the potential addictive effect of this technology is also nothing new (VIDEODROME). So the science in this neo-noir wannabe is not even remotely original as it think it is. But the whole VR stuff as shown in STRANGE DAYS is so outdated now that, in 2007, no one, and I mean no one even considers the whole VR trend as something remotely serious. This doesn't mean that in the near future there won't be some sort of VR technology but the kind shown in STRANGE DAYS is, by now, resoundingly silly. There's nothing sillier than outdated science-fiction and STRANGE DAYS surfers immeasurably from this affliction.

Having turned in wonderful performances in Schindler's List and Quiz Show he decided to put on leather pants and blather on about Faith having a cruise missile set on making it and her voice lifting stuff up to heaven (was he listening?).  I guess he was afraid of being typecast as a good actor.  Apparently this movie means to be thought-provoking and provide some sort of comment about entertainment, the media, blah blah blah, but its ideas are left completely undeveloped.  Because Ralph Fiennes writhes around in horror during the snuff scenes we're supposed to identify him as a good guy, and forget about him peddling tapes of people robbing liquor stores, having sex and terrorizing restaurant workers.  This movie unfortunately doesn't have enough unintentionally funny scenes to make enduring all 2 hours and 25 minutes of it worthwhile, but the one where Ralph watches what he thinks is the murder of the woman he loves is great.

It took a while to get into and even then I wasn't completely sold. The actors and characters were the only thing that really held this film together. The entire story seemed like a giant 90's cliché with a very jumpy plot. Those who aren't into science fiction might have a hard time keeping up and getting hooked.The story follows Lenny Nero, a former cop who now deals with dealing data disks that contain stored memories and emotions. Several days before the new millennium everyone is paranoid and acting rampant anticipating the world will end. Everyone is toting guns, swapping girls, acting on edge. Lenny gets a package with stored data and memories of a prostitute who is raped and murdered. This begins a spiral of events that open his eyes to relative murders like that of a rapper in the community and how each individual is involved. The scenes are suspenseful and show pure chaos in the streets including brutality and fires. Two dirty cops chase him in search of a disk that contains sensitive information. Meanwhile, Lenny's ex girlfriend Faith is now involved in a bad group and a new boyfriend name Philo. Lenny knows she's in danger but isn't sure how and gives her a way out, but she refuses.I really enjoyed the strong female role of Mace as she put Lenny in his place and reamed him out for not being a true friend and just using her for when it was convenient to him. She also explains that his life is just a series of scams and crooked jobs, essentially calling him out. There were a lot of terms that were confusing and difficult to understand without further analysis. A Squid is the device placed upon the cranium that helps playback the memories. I liked the slow reveal of pieces of information that help piece together previous information. When Mace watches the tape we learn how Jerrico was murdered and why Iris was on the run. However the movie was long winded and seemed to drag at parts. It's a different and unique film that covers content relevant to us now and could be relevant in the future as technology advances. Our culture has also placed heavy value on law enforcement and their duty to be inherently good. Not my favorite film and may not directly recommend it to any of my friends, but something to watch if you like a little gore, action, mild romance and science fiction.

It's a great film which could have been the Blade Runner of its' time but just didn't quite make it. A fabulous performance from Ralph Fiennes, playing so much against type but succeeding brilliantly, even his American accent is convincing (at least to my British ears). Angela Bassett is simply a revelation, her amazing Mace a long way from her Tina Turner. Great supporting cast too especially from Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner as two police officers who suddenly find themselves in way over their heads.It is quite simply far too long, you could have cut out nearly all of the nightclub sequences and not lost anything. Of course we all know that the millennium turned out to be not anything like as it is depicted but in the post Rodney King era this didn't seem that far fetched. I simply cannot watch the scene where Iris is murdered in the bathtub, it is so horrible it beggars belief. You would say that this is a misogynist film if it wasn't written and directed by woman. It's hard to keep track of the plot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Great central concept, wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to experience other peoples memories? The blazing limo scene is just terrific and Lenny is a surprisingly likable hero for such a dirtbag hustler (not least for the scene where he gives his friend in the wheelchair a clip of jogging along the beach). Laughed out loud at the sequence where he goes to confront the burglar in his flat only to realise he forgot to load his gun. Love, love, love the ending, the final kiss and embrace what we've all been rooting for all along. Adore the image of the hippy girl kissing the National Guardsman on top of the tank, just so beautiful, much like the LAPD coming good at the end showing humanity can prevail against all odds. And Mace and Lenny can get together and live happily ever after. Great music as well (the nightclub numbers aside) and adore Juliette Lewis character telling Lenny it's over, just pipping Mace reminding him that memories are meant to fade.A marvellous film that really deserved to do better at the box office.

Ex-cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) deals in 'playbacks', recordings you can wire into to see, hear and feel an experience as if you were there. When a playback of a murder is sent to Lenny, he teams up with limo driver Lornette Mace Mason (Angela Bassett) to unravel a conspiracy in order to protect himself and friends.Firstly, bear in mind while watching a film set in a year that has already passed you have to suspend some disbelief. Strange Days' vision of the future is a familiar one, leather-clad cyberpunks included, and the opening sequence sets the kind of pace you might expect in an action-thriller collaboration from adrenaline junkies like Kathryn Bigelow and writer James Cameron, so the film is an easy watch and you can enjoy it without worrying about the inaccuracies. The pace does slow down at points however, giving some parts a noirish feel similar to Blade Runner. Unfortunately at 140 minutes it did drag on a bit and some irrelevant sequences could have easily been cut out.The first person long takes in the 'playback' sequences, shot almost like a computer game, are a good feature and reminded me of both Halloween and strangely Being John Malkovich at the same time. As Lenny directs his actors playing out these recorded experiences, it suggest that maybe if technology advances enough these 'playbacks' could be the next step in film after 3D, allowing us to actually become a character. However, like in most James Cameron stories, there is hint of fear of this technology as it is sold in the black-market like a drug, people becoming hooked on these false experiences and using phrases like wired and jacking in.Ralph Fiennes does a decent job as a cocky rogue with a sensitive side, pining over ex Faith (Juliette Lewis), and his James Woods style American accent is a nice change from his usual characters, but the majority of the performances are fairly mediocre.Overall despite having several flaws, as any film will, Strange Days is an enjoyable classic 90s thriller and is definitely worth a watch if you don't take it too seriously.

Strange Days has the flashy, psychedelic look of 'Blade Runner', 'The Crow', and 'A Clockwork Orange', and is more exciting than all of these put together.Strange Days was directed by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow. Obviously the divorce was not too harsh, because she clearly agreed to direct his movie and make it good. Her combination eccentric art and power gives Strange Days an almost expressionist quality. It has epic cinematography, energetic action which goes hand-in-hand with rhythmic pacing, strong symbolism, and a plethora of colorful characters, each with a different personality and hairstyle.It is rare to see an action movie with such good qualities.

In was off limits for myself, but the intrigue of seeing something your not supposed to see was kinda like watching a porno behind your parents back.

It was a wild lead up to the actual second act but I was feeling intoxicated by the movies voodoo charm, it's ability to suck you into the eyeballs of a situation, keep you pitching questions as to what's going on with those evil cops.  I laughed at Lenny Nero's wit and cheek (played to perfection by Ralph), I sympathised with his love for Faith and was intrigued by the whole SQUID thing and the build up to turn of the millinium.  I had a love for every single character in the film, and despised those that were supposed to be despised.  Lenny's hero journey was amazing.  The way it was set out over the two nights really created a sense of realism and it's meandering leaps from subplot to subplot kept me hypnotised.

Seeing Strange Days that night with my dad is a memory that will never abandon me.  It is, to me, as near a perfect film as I can re-call, and is GROSSLY under-rated both commercially and critically.  Maybe it's violence and philosiphies tip the scales a little bit, perhaps limiting it's audience.  Look passed the evil rape scenes and you'll see something totally mind blowing.

I'm not sure). The cinematography is great this is a variation of colors and lights and shadows but the whole picture has a cool, deep blue basic color.

That's what a lot of people wanted to know. In the movie Strange Days, science fiction is given to a whole new meaning. Ralph Fiennes plays Lenny Nero, a ex-cop who becomes a hustler for playback discs that contains memories. Most of hem are about him a Faith(Juliette Lewis), a woman he can't let go. In one of the discs a friend discovers of a rape/murder of a lovely woman. Another which was more important shows the murder of a rapper by police officers. That one must me told before the end of the millennium. Mace(Angela Bassett) is very tough police officer who is very close to Nero tries her best to make him go ahead with his life and not reminisce on the past. Other than the two cops that killed the rapper, one of Nero friends was the culprit as well. As the year year came, Nero spends it with his new love, Mace. Seems like her feeling for him was stronger than anything Nero ever knew. Hey, they deserved each other! Great movie, great plot, a fine piece of work done by Bigelow and Cameron. 4 out of 5 stars!

Computer technology has put out a new virtual reality product called a SQUID that directly interlocks itself with the user's visual nerves, whatever they see is recorded. The SQUID in this movie isn't the main deal, it's a tool used for uncovering one of the biggest cover-ups the nation has seen in many years. After two renegade cops kill an outspoken rapper in a routine traffic stop, two passengers riding with the rapper bail out and run for help, one of them wearing a SQUID and capturing every moment on tape. If the tape gets out it would cause a nation-wide riot. Just happens to be that the person who recorded the incident is a friend of a VR dealer named Lenny Nero (Ralph Finnes).The movie compels you to watch every second. Where the story begins to fade James Cameron gives you some action sequences and even nudity just to keep the viewer watching. One of the greatest science fiction stories ever told because of the type of people the movie deals with, these people who can make or break the fate of a nation on the most uncertain day for people in thousands of years, Y2K.Strange Days has many subplots that don't make very much sense, like the relationship between Ralph Finnes and Juliete Lewis, the relationship could have been forgone, and nobody would have missed it. It's never really explained why Lenny's best friend played by Tom Sizemore turns into such an evil character (the guy is serial killer with a twist of pure evil, and I mean pure evil.) Yet, the movie is so great you won't care about any of that.Strange Days is a must see for anyone, not just science fiction fans. If you like Ralph Finnes work you'll like it, if you have ever witnessed a James Cameron film and liked it just a little, you'll love this film. Compelling from start to end, Strange Days is a modern work of art that is and probably will stay an under-rated piece of work.Reviewer's Personal Note I like to clap out loud at movie theaters or watching one at home if I really enjoyed it. I watch about a movie every other day, and I hadn't had a movie to clap for, for about a couple of months, after this one was done, the whole story flashed threw my mind as I realized how great it was. I clapped twice, near the end, and after the credits. Don't rent it, go buy it.

Anyway...This contains a tiny spoiler that isn't really much of a spoiler at all, but I'm giving you fair warning even though it is marked within the review, itself.Beneath all of the glitter and obvious cinematic method of Strange Days, there's a surprising amount of substance to the script which, despite any borrowings here and there, remains, to my mind, one of the better noirish mystery stories ever put to film. While comparisons to earlier cyberpunk and grim sci-fi dystopian films will abound (how many times have earlier reviewers mentioned Blade Runner?), Strange Days has them beat hands down by the sheer strength of its adeptly interwoven and macabre intrigue elements and the overarching theme of real life versus playback; to wit, the evolutionary necessity of an imperfect, fading memory.This is a story that, apart from its copious science fiction elements, could have easily been written by Dashiell Hammet. The plotting is brilliant, such that clues are dropped into the flow of the story quite frequently and yet so subtly that you won't put them all together until the very end. It is a challenging film, to be sure, and one you may not completely understand upon your first viewing. It demands your attention, but it rewards it, I think, amply with an excellent script by James Cameron and Jay Cocks, containing sparkling, directed dialogue that never dumbs itself down or exhibits a lack of respect for its audience's attention span.If you'll allow me to get all film school on you for a minute, Strange Days's script is a perfect example of economical yet entertaining storytelling. Every line in this film serves a purpose. There are no throw-aways. No slick sounding dialogue for the sake of slick-sounding dialogue. When a character speaks, you'll want to pay attention, because there's a reason for what he or she is saying, even if its purpose isn't immediately evident, whether it is to reveal a piece of the mystery, to develop a character's personality, to establish the precise nature of a relationship, or simply to explain the conceit of playback. But in any case, exposition is never roughly wedged into the plot so much as it meshes with it. You'll never say to yourself, Gee, thanks for explaining that, Strange Days, now let's get back to the movie.The script additionally plumbs the complex abyss of love, unrequited and lost, with the sort of emotional intelligence one wouldn't normally expect from a film of this nature, and explores the value of stepping up to the challenge of real time, real life, of not letting life slip by while you're caught in an infinite past loop. By setting the film on the eve of the millennium, the writers give a real implication to the idea of out with the old, in with the new, or more dramatically, death and rebirth (<spoiler> anybody else notice how Lenny Nero dies at the end? </spoiler>). But more than anything else, it probes the notion that things will invariably continue with or without you. It's something of a dirty little downer, but framed positively by the surrounding concept that there's really no such thing as the grand scheme and that the problems of two people may not amount to a hill of beans, but they're still the only problems that are ever really important to anybody.Throw in likeable performances by the superb Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett, as well as some adequate and more than adequate supporting and character performances (Richard Edson as Tick is especially entertaining), and you really can't go wrong.Spreading a little positivity...

His eyes are so vulnerable and his words so sleazy, you don't know whether to kick him or hug him. Angela Bassett is tough and brittle as Mace, a straight-arrow limo-driver whose one weakness is her unrequited love for Lenny. It's not at all surprising that James Cameron wrote this script- he is very big on strong female characters, and Mace continues that tradition. Unfortunately, none of the other characters are so interesting as these two. For reasons unknown, Bigalow cast the very fine actress Juliette Lewis as Lenny's ex, Faith, and then gave her nothing to do except smoke cigarettes and look sexy (which she does) in a series of ever-more revealing outfits. A total waste of Ms. Lewis's talent, no matter how much fun it is to look at her. Terrific character actors Tom Sizemore and Michael Wincott could both do all they're called on to do here in their sleep. Vincent D'Onofrio does his scuzz-bucket routine as a murderous cop- but that routine is always compelling, so that's okay. The artificial reality thing is hardly original, but this movie's realization of 'playback' is intriguing. The violent scenes in which the victims are wired to see what's being done to them through the eyes of the perpetrator are highly unsettling and creepy; the POV and an understanding of how the wire works make these scenes seem less than entirely distant- the viewer feels a bit too close for comfort. The whole rap-star murder aspect of the plot seems a bit too pointed and obvious; it works well enough as a device, but comes off exactly like that- a device. Bigalow portrays 'the future' in Blade Runner-ish fashion, with the city of Los Angeles as a virtual war zone where the law and the citizens are equally out of control. The climax of the film could have been taken from a zillion other sci-fi/action movies and is less than satisfying. But despite the ending, this dark piece of futuristic noir works as a whole, primarily due to its two leads and a well-realized atmosphere.       "},{"Title":"Hello?

No, Brainstorm doesn't have that dark and dirty look that seems so popular these days.  But it has many more truly memorable scenes that stick in the mind forever.. Christopher Walken experiencing Louise Fletcher's death when he plays back the toxic tape.  Walken and Wood's rapture under the sheets.  The Brainstorm company salesman, stuck in an all-night orgasmic frenzy, to the point of collapse as he plays back a looped sequence from a tape a lab engineer had recorded while he was being humped by a sexy blonde. Strange Days has nothing to equal these scenes still vivid in my mind from a film I saw 18 years ago, compared to one I saw yesterday.And given the choice of watching Walken and the radiant Wood (in her final film appearance) as married lovers, versus Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Look! I'm reprising my role from 'Natural Born Killers' again for the 29th time! Lewis, well to me, there just ain't much to decide.. Someone needs to take Ms. Lewis out back and tell her that the harder she tries to appear sexy, the less she is..There's absolutely NOTHING original about Strange Days.  From the device itself, to the dark gang-infested streets, to the year-early Millennium hysteria (you want Hollywood hysteria? Try watching Miracle Mile sometime!)Nearly all reviews mention the Blade Runner-ish noir look it has, and the original concept of the playback device.

Strange then that the critical reception to this film was so muted. Perhaps it's weaknesses (most obviously with the whodunnit aspects of the film) blinded viewers to the astounding technical achievements of the film, its editing drive, it's superb crowd scenes and a perfectly judged performance by Fiennes.This is a panicky, nervous film, full of the angst and worries best summed up by the term 'pre-Millennium tension'. With a few exceptions, no one and nothing seem to stand still. Either the camera is on the move, or the editing dices and chops the scene, creating in the viewer an unsettled anxiousness. For we are waiting, like expectant Millennium fathers. Literally, of course, the whole film is a gigantic countdown to midnight, New Year's eve. It is also a suspenseful wait to see who is the killer, whether the crowds will riot, if Nero and 'Mace' end up together, if the policemen are caught and so on. Every film has its elements of suspense as part of the plot. What Bigelow and Cameron have done is to reflect and amplify this traditional audience expectation onto a sort of collective dread, as the world teeters uncertainly on the edge of the new century - one where technology and society seem out of control. The streets are ablaze, the police have tanks ready, ethnic protest groups are making ominous sounds, and traditional relationships are breaking down. Perhaps it is a time when a new world is being born as well as a new century.Given this wider vision, and the overwhelming nature of episode of the first-person cinematography, quibbles about the plot seem almost irrelevant. One can forgive the weakness behind the identity of the killer and sink into the broader, more exciting canvas so carefully created.This is a film most obviously about the impact of new technology on individuals and society. The concept and demonstration of 'jacking-in' is, also, aptly self-referential. For the act of watching others and their actions is not only characteristic of the new software. It is a particularly cinematic experience too, and Strange Days has a lot to say about the nature of, and relationship between, fiction and reality. That is one reason why the violence and sex in the film seems so shocking, so personal. Rather like the killings in Powell's 'Peeping Tom' (another reflection on the nature of the cinematic 'gaze') victims are made to watch their own death agonies. The point of view forces us to assume the perspective of the killer. Nero's distaste for 'blackjack' is obvious, and none of the mayhem is condoned. Never the less such scenes have a unique power and ability to appall.This viewer was reminded at times of Blade Runner, such is the care taken over a presentation of a futuristic society and detailed environment. (Most explicitly perhaps in the long overhead shot that starts the final scenes and then Nero's sight of an airship at the close). Blade Runner, too, has it's own technology run riot (the replicants). However in the earlier film, we are presented with a society after the big changes. Strange Days' world is still being born and therefore the dread of what is to come more acute.But ultimately like Scott's film, this is a masterpiece of futuristic urban prediction, a flamboyant and daring vision of mankind whose reputation is growing as time passes "},{"Title":"A mixed bag.","Date":"12 May 2000","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I first saw Strange Days in theater when it came out, and liked it a lot. The film is superb both visually and aurally, so when seen on the big screen, the visceral effect it has is tremendous. Until a couple of months ago I had good memories of the film, but then I saw it again on video, and had to revise some of my opinions.First of all, the plot, the dialogue and the characters in the movie are somewhat clichéd. At times Strange Days feels genuinely fresh and innovative, but the basic suspense film setup, used in thousands of movies, makes some of the scenes appear pretty awkward. The actors are a mixed bag as well; Ralph Fiennes and Angela Basset do a fine job, but Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore and Michael Wincott pull off with their usual mannerisms, so I felt like watching Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore and Michael Wincott instead of their characters.The film's worst flaw, however, is the conclusion of the murder mystery; I didn't like it when I first saw Strange Days, and on the second viewing it felt even more blatant. Without giving away the ending I can say it is the most basic kind of solution a thriller could ever offer. Worst of all, it comes straight out of the blue, making it quite hard to swallow. Also, the resolution of the cop conspiracy plot was a bit too easy; this is a dystopy, so the explanation given felt somewhat too optimistic. I would've liked a stronger anti-police message.I think the movie would've probably been better without the whole whodunit angle. Strange Days has a great cyberpunkish feel to it, so it could've just been an atmospheric mixture of politics, science fiction and romance. Now it is just a good-looking sci-fi flick with some originality and far too much conventionality.

This kind of movie is not for everyone, mainly because of a rape scene about 45min in.  It is a drama with sci-fi elements.  The movie focuses on a man called Lenny Nero played by Ralph Fienes.  In the movie the feds created a head device called squid which can record a person's thoughts, feelings, and sight.  The squid is now used as sort of an escape from reality drug with tapes instead of needles.  Lenny is a black market dealer of these tapes.  His friend Mace is played by Angela Bassett.  Angela's acting in the movie is excellent and Ralph's is also good. The movie also has a great sound track with several good songs.  The movie starts off with Lenny dealing tapes when he receives a tape of someone killing and raping his friend Iris.  Lenny is then thrown into a murder scene with the killer leaving behind tapes to taunt Lenny.  Lenny, with the help of his friend Mace, must find the murderer before he becomes the next victim. The movie gives a powerful message about racism in that it is killing our country and must stop. The critics gave this movie a hard time because they were probably turned away at the sex and the rape scene.  However in the entire movie, including the rape scene, breasts are the only private part you can see, which is probably how it avoided an NC-17 rating.

Ralph Fiennes plays Lenny Nero, a virtual reality hustler who sells clips to customers who want to not only see the action, but feel it as well.

No way you can forget that part!While the movie was playing I started to realize that relatively soon the new millennium Is upon us. It would be less than 4 years or we would be there. And the science-fiction part of the movie came completely reasonable. I really think that one day virtual reality will look much like this. Isn't it at the end of 1999, then a few years after it.Also the music was a positive surprise. Not the usual classic-orientated sphere-creators but a mix of ambient, trash and techno. After the scene in which it was used, Coral Lounge kept pumpin' in my head. The end credits in combination with While the earth sleeps was/is the best movie-ending so far. It is of a kind that lets you sit till the very end of the celluloid. When you see this part, you only could realise that you just saw one of the greatest movies of all time... or just missed it.What is more positive about this movie? Well, the script is well-considered. James Cameron did a really good job there (why didn't he do the same for  Titanic (1997)). You could take a lot of quotes out of it, and it is brought in a convincing way also. The actors really seem to mean what they say. Sometimes the script lets you think about things. Just Listen to Max's Everything has already been done-speech to give an example.After all remains one question Why wasn't it such a big success? under -advertised, too alternative, too violent? I don't know. A lot of people whom I talked about this movie- masterpiece almost all agreed with me that it is one that made the biggest impact so far (for a sneak-preview). Of all the visitors that day (april 96) the average was 7,4 - 7,5 so it could have been a hit in The Netherlands, wasn't it that it only screened in the 4 major cities. What a pity, because while it is not my personal best picture of all time, it's a very close second. A strong recommendation is placed here A world-wide re-release at the end of 1999. Don't make the same mistake as in 1995-1996 because this movie deserves much-MUCH better.  "},{"Title":"Complex and crystal clear.

Not only does it have a Cronenbergian approach of the whole Mind/Body theme, but it is ballsy enough to put political conflict, Armaggedon and ethics regarding the future of pornography in the mix.Strange Days walks several paths while staying consistent and coherent every second. And if that is not enough to convince you, the nearly two-minutes length play-back action shot should do the trick. They're dynamic as hell, really shocking when they want to and are the only thing you need to say Damn, Bigelow can hold a camera.Maybe the best of the Cameron/Bigelow flicks, you can call yourself an anticipation fan if you haven't seen it.

If one were to watch Strange Days and The Hurt Locker back to back, one would have to at least concede that it took someone with a pair of creative-balls to pull off some of the stuff that happens, from the perilous action to the unforgettable characters and story that kicks you in the gut just to go for more. In Strange Days, a movie written by James Cameron (which, by the way, may even be his finest screenplay), is a future-noir that jumps a mere five years in the future, set in LA in 1999 right on the cusp of the year 2000, when, you know, everything is supposed to go wild.The key here, among other things, is Ralph Fiennes, playing a somewhat uncharacteristic conman (and ex policeman) who sells tiny videos that provide a customer with a view into a person's own visual cortex - a real-life virtual reality experience where one is hooked up into the first-person point of view of another person (mostly for sex purposes, and other exotic desires). But there's a video that Lenny character watches that puts him in a whole other mood than his usual scummy-but-dealing-with-it kind of figure a video showing the rape and murder of a woman in a hotel, where the killer programmed the woman to also record her experience from her point of view so he could get off on her full-blown terror. It's a startling shock that sends him to warn his ex-girlfriend (Juliette Lewis) that she could be next. Then the next night it's December 31st... what will happen next? The intensity of the script is two-fold first for the intelligence in how this character Lenny, a jaded guy whose has his share of demons, shuffles and goes about this truly f***ed up just-begging-to-be-apocalyptic Los Angeles, and then secondly how Bigelow translates that into a distinctive look and feel. At the time the style of first-person done in the film was new and fresh, and it shows. It gives another urgency to the point of view, whether its in that opening rush up the stairs and running down the hall, or in a more sensual light in a love scene with Juliette Lewis, or of course the murder scene, we're put into a whole other frame of reference than just usual hand-held, and this is complimented by a world shown in grungy and dingy urban colors and dark streets and buildings where, no wonder, people want to escape. The ideas are rich for the taking and Cameron and Bigelow go for as many as they can.And, as they make strides in their style, they also cast very well. Fiennes is really delivering a powerhouse here, especially because he's really quite funny (this and In Bruges are really the only other times I can think of when he's put himself to dark-comic use) and then later on in the movie turns into a torn figure out of a Blade Runner. Other kudos must go to Lewis, Sizemore, Bassett and Michael Wincott as Philo Gant. Strange Days could have fallen into some traps with its plot and characters, but it doesn't seem to and doesn't really need to. Its a self-contained piece of entertaining pop-art, full of energy and action and creativity. It's a no-holds-barred genre movie, and it simply kicks ass on emotional and intellectual levels; you can talk about it with friends in-deptbh, or just sit back by yourself and enjoy the ride.

It can't resist mentioning them here, because these elements are seemingly what sets the script apart. Yet, anybody closely following the film will notice that those elements are really nothing more than gimmicks. The SQUID system, which allows users to 'live' prerecorded experiences (not just the audio-visual components, as with cinema) is just a plot device. You know the drill, someone uses a recording device and accidently records something, gets offed and the recording ends up in our hero's hands. It's been done in different variations (check Coppola's The Conversation) and both before and after Strange Days (see Enemy of the State). The fact that the recording device is a SQUID in this case, hardly does anything to change this contrived plot. It's also not a very original idea, because the SQUID feels very similar to the so-called simstim-system in William Gibson's Neuromancer (only in Neuromancer it's real-time experiences, not prerecorded ones). This of course brings to light the connection with cyberpunk and virtual reality, but, a few decent pieces of dialogue and a subplot about (metaphorically speaking) living in memories aside, this is about as deep as the connection goes. Strange Days does not delve deep into cyberpunk-ideas and just uses one as a plot device.The second gimmick is the Millennial feeling. Strange Days represents a near future (at least at the time it was made) in which societal tensions are mounting and all that's required to push it over the edge is...well, a push. Everyone in this movie is somewhere between partying and exploring darker sides. And they know some things are going to change coming the new millennium, they just don't know what. Strange Days comes pretty close to depicting the real-life millennial feeling; the chaos and overblown dramatics surrounding the Y2K-bug, I mean. Never had a party like the movie's, though. So, although this millennial element is also a gimmick, it's at least more decently woven into the storyline than that SQUID stuff.Right now, I'm still sounding pretty negative about the movie. And that's true, I was expecting something more deeply involved with cyberpunk themes, and not a expensive-looking thriller with parallels with the whole Rodney King thing. Still, there's a lot to like here. Ralph Fiennes nails the Lenny Nero character perfectly and smoothly blends a wise-ass sales rep with a man who's unable to come to terms with his present reality. Even better is Angela Bassett, a worthy addition to James Camerons long line of strong movie heroines. I liked Michael Wincott as well, but I thought Tom Sizemore and especially Julliette Lewis dropped the ball on this one. And then there's Kathryn Bigelow stylish direction. It's not as much of an adrenalin rush as, say, Point Break, but Strange Days packs more than enough visual punch. Also, the opening sequence is brilliantly executed and is up there with the best of the best of the best. That said, at 135 minutes, the film does feel a little overlong.In short Strange Days makes for a reasonably entertaining thriller, but it's really too chiched and gimmicky to be anything more than a that.Rating 6/10 "},{"Title":"Basic idea is good but plot holes are way too big","Date":"3 December 2007","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Strange Days had a great potential to become a good movie, but unfortunately it turns out to be quite a mess. First hour of the movie is great; we get to know what Lenny is doing for living, we see what is happening in LA and we're introduce with this data-discs that are containing recorded memories and emotions. On that way people are experiencing everything and Lenny is a man who is selling this stuff. One day he receives a disc which contains the memories of a murderer killing a prostitute. Lenny soon starts investigating this murder with his friends Mace and Max.And after this introducing I was waiting for a perfect ending. Boy, I was surprised with rest of this movie. I was simply disappointed. In this movie there are things that are done for at least million times, like two main characters escaping from a drowning car, happy ending and very predictable story. What hurts me the most is that I knew who the killer was all the time. Really noting innovative and very easily predictable. Actually, I said to myself at one point of the movie if he's a killer this movie is crap.But after all, I recommend this movie for truly lovers of James Cameron work, cause basic idea is good but execution is poor. Kathryn Bigelow shows to be a great choice for a director and also Fiennes and Sizemore are pretty good. What surprised me is bad acting from Juliette Lewis and casting of Michael Wincott (most annoying voice of all). So, watch this movie cause of very good first hour and then after it watch how this movie sinks deeper and deeper.

I had seen it a few years before and it was okay. But I thought maybe I'd be in a different frame of mind this time and really enjoy it. Well, it was about the same for me as it was in 1996. I noticed other details within it, but it was still pretty much the same to me.Kathryn Bigelow never makes the same movie twice (Point Break, K-19 The Widowmaker), and she knows how to tell a story. But in this case, she almost seems to tell TWO stories that are more like two contrived paradoxes. The ending was quite long in terms of developing into something taut and mono-problematic. That's become quite a cinematic cliché' now (Die Hard anyone?), it's so boring to watch. Not to mention how Tom Sizemore explains the whole plan to Lenny- it seemed so shoe-horned in. And the dialogue would make me want to scratch my head, like it tries so hard to sound cool. Ralph Fiennes is okay, but he's always played classier characters that I couldn't see him as a scum like he was depicted to be. Juliette Lewis does a fair job and is her usual un-redeeming white-trash self; Angela Basset was a true bad-ass with a capital B. Tom Sizemore does a bland as vanilla job and his wig's just stupid. Michael Wincott, Glenn Plummer, Michael Jace, Belinda Bako, William Fichtner and Vincent D'onofrio are all good in their supporting roles.The predictions and the production design just with how the future would be presented five years from 1995 are pretty plausible. I like how the makers chose to let L.A. keep it's urban decay along with its idiosyncrasies. You see Lenny's Mercedes, and it looks like a model on the market in the late 1990s. There are subtleties all around and Kathryn Bigelow was very careful not let them become obvious. That's the technique of an artist, so Ms. Bigelow gets props there. The scene where they recover the disc in the junkyard was tight, as well as the getaway. CALM DOWN BABY, THIS IS WHAT I DO! It has an eerie Blade Runner feel to it as well- almost as if this is what the future in five years will look like, and then the future will look like it does in Blade Runner forty years from then. It was impressive. I didn't care how there was no variety of music- it all sounds like headbanger stuff. All sounded the same. We didn't need to see ALL the riffs in the club either, since the same music was heard at the end of the film in front of the Bonevencher. But still, the movie was watchable.There were unnecessary sub-plots with Max and telling them about the rumors of death squads and other things that made the movie drag. The film was also unclear with why Lenny was kicked off the police force. I heard that it was because he was a pedophile, and if that was the case, there would be no way that Angela Basset would go fifty feet near this man knowing that. Maybe he was dealing playback to people while a cop- like an entrepreneur. But what was interesting was the whole SQUIDD concept itself- and I can see how people could get addicted to watching or experiencing other's memories as a form of escapism. The fact that there is harm to the brain with it also makes it very plausible that it could be declared illegal. I think that was ahead of its time when this movie came out, but now some people are recording mayhem and crimes with their camera phones and constantly playing it back for entertainment. Disturbing but true. Strange Days could of and should of been better. It has a depressing dynamic to it (like the above-mentioned Blade Runner has), where the future shouldn't be as hopeful as we all want it to be. And one wants to take prozac after viewing this multiple times. Due to the fact that this took place on a certain date-- which we have now surpassed-- the movie seems to date itself. But even the Y-2K movies of the late nineties are more or less forgotten now.Unfortunately, this too, is one of them.

The first and most obvious was that it was set in a near future (New Year's Eve 1999) which is now the near past. It involves a devise which allows people to have their brains wired into POV recordings of hyper extreme experiences which they can enter vicariously. As usual, the near future, this time Los Angeles, has become an ugly dystopia. There is a perpetual riot ongoing complete with burning cars, brutal police actions, gangs of roving vandals and assorted degenerates which people seem to accept and ignore like a pothole, which curiously, since social structures have broken down, do not exist. This has the overwhelming art direction typical of all movies set in the near future. Since another conceit has the action poised on the edge of that great pinhead monument - observance of the millennium, its all one huge party in the Calcutta crowded streets under a constant three day shower of confetti. Yeah, just like it really happened. In its favor, unlike other near future experiences, at least the product placement partners haven't all gone under unlike those in 2001. The POV devise of course means that at some time there will be a secret recording, i.e. the MacGuffen, which everyone will try to conceal and search for and kill for etc. It is also an easy metaphor for the sometimes addictive and destructive nature of electronic media e.g. the movies themselves. This is one rationalization for intelligent people to involve themselves in just the kind of visceral violent sado sexual trash that they claim to be criticizing, while collecting handsome checks along the way.The future seems to be as crowded with marginalia as a Brugel or Ivan Albright painting. Everything is dirty. The men all seem to have long greasy hair with loads of split ends. Skin glistens, stubble forests appear in patches on cheeks, people are shot down in crowds without notice like bison dropping one by one from a Sharps .50 to an oblivious herd. Women's heavy, multi-colored make up become Picasso like distortions. Every inch of every frame is filled with extras all doing something, a triumph of mise en scene. Stuff crowds every frame. Even more impressive than the production design is the lighting. No shot is simply photographed but everywhere, even in the far distance, is carefully lighted. Smears of colors compose the backgrounds like the sports action paintings of LeRoy Nieman while flaming cars and kinetic crowds, all carefully lighted with chiaroscuro and contrast, swirl in the foreground. Reputedly the director, Katherine Bigalow, spent a considerable amount of time just planning every shot and any shot which consists of multiple lighting set-ups can take an eternity to pull off, with the rewards mere seconds of finished film.With all of this effort at its core the story STRANGE DAYS has to tell is the same old same old and not even a very interesting variant at that. We have the dog kicking villain (Philo), the femme fatale (Faith) whom the hero (Nero) carries an everlasting torch for, the betrayal writ large, the ex-cop , the beatings... Everything done in the picture, each 'moment', is repeated two and three times. The ex-cop's ex-girlfriend now lives with a slimy music producer whose henchmen are directed to beat the hero from time to time. For some reason this music producer is connected to a Malcolm X like black militant who has been murdered. This is never adequately explained. On the one hand the black militant is treated with the up most respect yet he is seen as closely connected to this thug who openly belts women in the mouth. Its a case of you buy the premise, you buy the bit. Philo's brutality is part of another plot devise, like concentric circles. Because he is a degenerate who is addicted to the POV devise it is possible to have a MacGuffen to run after and to have a record, after the fact, of the police murder of the black militant and set up the sub plot of the murdering cops hunting down the MacGuffen and eliminating witnesses. (Ever seen that movie before?) So it is necessary to connect Philo to the black militant. It is necessary to make him brutal to justify the hero's concern, to create a damsel in distress and motivate a rescue and a denouement. This is villainy straight out of pay per view wrestling. Its unfortunate that these two different worlds conflict but you can't have everything mate. Action junkies, it was hoped, wouldn't notice such ethical inconsistencies. This is why the film business is dominated by those with legal training because it is all logically calculated if totally unauthentic.Yeah this whole carefully constructed, hugely considered, tremendously expensive armature is clothed in the threadbare hand me down raiments of a hackneyed, wait, two hackneyed, well three hackneyed plots. There's the cops cleaning up their crime, the brutal gang thug abusing the love object and the best friend who sets up the hero as a patsy in a murder. None of them, even all of them, seem worth the effort expended in making this movie. There is however, an agenda, a not-so hidden agenda. This is a damming description of the brutal, homicidal, raciest Los Angeles police department. There is a recreation of the Rodney King beating and in fact the streets seem to be a continuation of the riots which followed the King verdict. Even this one single item of passionate interest is spoiled in the end by making the killer cops rogues and, when the new millennium comes in, giving hope for the future as black and white, kids and cops, old and young embrace as the confetti rains down and the streets resound with the end credit music. In the end, its all about rationalization, a film like any other whose existence is purely self-justification.

Baby spoilers.","Date":"11 April 2003","Score":"8 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Strange Days(1995) strangely mistimed its Millennial warning. 4.2yrs premature, it attempted to forewarn society about self-indulgence, but faltered with a payoff for excessive plot ratcheting its Hollywood ending.The title makes oblique reference to the Chinese curse `May you live in interesting times'--times when people indulge gross pettiness against their neighbours. (Once you've decided all the rules've changed, your friends might seem like enemies.) Times of religious/political propaganda are in exactly that way `interesting'/'strange'.The screenplay, co-written by Jim Cameron and Jay Cocks (Titanic(1997) (uncredited), Gangs of New York(2002)), was produced by Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment, and directed by Cameron's real-life ex-wife, Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break(1991), The Weight of Water(2000)).Bigelow mounts a populous, loud, mean-and-sleazy near-future dystopia. Muggers, police in riot gear, and tanks populate her corrupt 1999 LA. Almost all the action takes place at night, because our zero, Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes), conducts his deals around 2am. All that corruption cleverly implies people's converse need for honesty via each others' private lives, using `visual narcotics' (SQUID clips).Lenny is an ex-cop reduced to a hustler with even sleazier friends; barring one buff diva. Angela Bassett's mace-carrying Lornette Mason remains Bassett's signature role. 'Mace' is a powderkeg paragon of whatever virtue is still left in LA, 46hrs before `The Rapture'.The film's technothriller reputation has rested on its hopped-up 4min single-shot opening robbery sequence. DoP Matt Leonetti and editor Howard Smith faked the fast & furious POV-sequences using lightweight handhelds with modified steadicam- and pogocam-rigs, a Helmet Integrated Display (HID) camera, and whipping cuts. Our POV vision suddenly drops out when the `wearer' dies--the emotional immediacy supplying Lenny's clips with kick.But the real jewel in the movie's crown is its social resonance--not in its dystopia, but its depiction of psychological addiction.SQUID clips often devastate their addicts, although it's never technology per se that harms, but people's technologically amplified cruelty/stupidity turned against themselves (or each other). Lenny remains untouched because he uses clips for only one thing remembering his ex-girlfriend, Faith(Juliette Lewis), before she left him.  This element now cliches the dystopian technothriller--all four of TimeCop(1994), this film, 6th Sense(2000), and Minority Report(2002) incorporate mourning husband-types grooving on their dead-or-departed women.In contrast, Faith's current boyfriend, Philo Gant(Michael Wincott)--a ruthless music producer who one day `might' record her--is completely addicted to clips. He's suspicious of everybody, and feeds his growing paranoia on the technology. Unfortunately this drives him further into decline. The Achilles' Heel of all bugging is ANALYSIS. As Philo jacks-in his staff, some saner than others, they go off the rails, too.The film echoes Philo's spiralling insanity with society's hysteria about cataclysm. Any person or group living in terror presents a constant, growing danger to their neighbours as they panic. Some (ab)use of the technology might prove self-limiting; but users with high stimulation thresholds would crave it. And since SQUID technology permits new crimes (feedback thrills, frontal lobe-frying), without legal protections, in the hands of organised crime, it'd propel society deeper into anarchy.Some plot twists are clever--in Max(Tom Sizemore)'s case, too clever (NB his wounding and pensioning-off the police force are significant); yet the 2hr25min film still concludes with an implausible ending! The script spent so much screentime putting Lenny and 'Mace' in danger, that by the time they hook up, the audience knows their personalities are just too different (`Eww, that's not raaht...It's life Jim, but not as we know it!'). -)The engrossing introductory exposition runs to 20mins, periodically intercut by mysterious action that continues for ANOTHER HOUR(!) before it's revealed WHY two cops are chasing Iris(Brigitte Bako). By then the screenplay's deliberate second-guessing of the plot would have frustrated the interest of many.Vincent D'Onofrio is the sweaty, unrelenting Officer Steckler (Cameron's mouthpiece, Jeriko-One, dubs him `RoboSteckler'), who delivers one howlingly ridiculous line during the Jeriko shakedown `(So) you're the one that's been getting the gangbangers together, going downtown, forming citizen's groups!'-Citizen's groups?!?! Gangbangers??Glenn Plummer's Jeriko-One was no doubt meant to be a serious activist, not a dime-a-dozen stereotype. Earlier, Jeriko was rapping militant lyrics and wearing Malcolm X-like glasses at the lectern, but the veneer doesn't hold. He's revealed as just an angry young man `You pulled over the WRONG black man--I'm that 800-lb gorilla in your mist, f***a'....etc. Watch Jeriko's whores laugh derisively to bolster his foolish ego as he taunts `Robo'Steckler.Bigelow's pandering to grunge subculture is inadequate/irritating, for instance, with this transparent appeal to Jeriko-wannabes, and to fans of Philo's awful live bands.Which brings me to Juliette Lewis' Faith. Faith is so cheap & POINTLESS that even her boyfriend Philo labels her a whore. Her character design is based on Janis Joplin/The Rose(1979), but Faith/Lewis' voice, or lyrics, are no match. Her zombie, tit-hanging-out-of-her-metal-dress style is embarrassing, not ennobling.These elements hint at a Millennial/postmodernist loss-of-control over our own lives, but lose effect with Faith's deliberately male-oriented eye-candy packaging. Even her best scene, on the balcony, is too-little-too-late for our connection with her. Faith is a self-destructive waif, ineffectually intoning `I'm sorry baby'.The controlled Ms Bassett, also in bare feet and minidress, instead seems 7'-tall, easily subduing two male cops with their own truncheons. Bassett won a Saturn Best Actress Award(1996) for this; I wish 'Mace' got her own series!My 'secret' fav. scene is when Lenny gives a clip to a paraplegic friend it's of feet running in surf, so the SQUID geek in the wheelchair is in ecstasy. It's both humbling and sweet to experience his joy with him, but SO tragic to have the recording end.Disappointingly, SQUID technology is still highly implausible. Only a complete overhaul of our current models of mind & matter would make it work. Qualia are still poorly understood.Strange Days' early release may have dampened Rapturist hysteria in 1995,but would've been much more effective in Dec 1999....no doubt the 4.2yrs were needed for `SQUID clips' to appear even vaguely plausible.(9/10)  "},{"Title":"The Future is Strange Days.","Date":"15 September 2015","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Strange Days (1995) Dir Kathryn Bigelow / Cast Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore, Michael Wincott Excellent science fiction thriller unleashing a spectacular futuristic Los Angeles.

Juliette Lewis plays the corrupted nightclub singer who does a riveting number when she first appears. Tome Sizemore appears as a contact of Fiennes but the role is a disappointment because he is too obvious and never comes off as trusting.

Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is an ex-cop who trades in clips of recorded memories. Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) records the wearer's brain waves which can be played and experienced. The technology is illegal and he works in the black market. Meanwhile, call girl Iris (Brigitte Bako) barely escapes from policemen Burton Steckler (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Dwayne Engelman (William Fichtner). They discover that she was wearing a SQUID. She finds her friend Lenny's car and slips him a clip. Lenny still misses his ex Faith Justin (Juliette Lewis) who left him for music producer Philo Gant (Michael Wincott). Max Peltier (Tom Sizemore) is Lenny's brash scraggly lowlife friend. Mace (Angela Bassett) is his more put-together friend.Fiennes has great jittery sleaziness. I like the idea of this gritty near-future including its campy touches. James Cameron may have stuffed in too much story. The movie needs to cut out something and I would probably pick Faith. Iris can instead be Lenny's ex. It would elevate the intense need to find her. The rest could be a great revenge film. The movie is so full that it doesn't really need the extra twist. Kathryn Bigelow's direction is good although she may need more substance to throw at the screen. She needs a bit more special effects and a little less of the cheaper looking real world stuff. A desolate street is just as effective as one filled with people. It looks like she tried to stage multiple riots which ends up looking cheesy. The money could be better spent with a trashed abandoned bad side of the town. The story gets a bit too complex and some simplification would be helpful.

Police brutality, anarchic riots and a nihilistic atmosphere all contribute to the dark and edgy tone of the film which begins so brilliantly that it would be hard- pressed to maintain such a high order. Unfortunately, that is the case.The opening sequence is shot from entirely one character's POV as hand-held cameras swirl around freely, taking in all the action with such rabid voyeurism that it would suck almost anyone into watching intently. What follows is a film with some impressive questions and issues to raise but ultimately sifts them through a mostly standard action plot involving numerous beatings, chase sequences and even a few scenes of rape. Needless to say, these plot devices are not entirely necessary to explore these ideas but Bigelow makes it work for the most part, using every camera and editing trick in her arsenal. The screenplay, co- written by James Cameron, has his usual breathless action scenes as well as tight pacing that takes us right up to a number of stunning conclusions that by the very end topple over one another. Perhaps it is a bit too ambitious, but this film does deserve to be called the Blade Runner of the 1990s and boasts some very fine performances, not the least of which belongs to the amazingly versatile Ralph Fiennes. All in all, this is an action film worth checking out if only for the incredible techniques implemented to fulfill its vision. The problem lies within the vision, which is overstuffed and at times difficult to entirely comprehend.

Ex-Cop Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is the guy you go to for all your virtual dreams. He can get you anything from the ultimate vacation to porno and everything in between. Nero's world is soon to be turned upside when on the eve of the millennium, he receives a tape which contains the murder of someone he knows. Many people don't know this, but Strange Days was actually written by famed Director, James Cameron, shortly before he did Titanic, a stark contrast from one project to the other. The mystery of Strange Days, as well as the machine, are cool as hell. What's not is how it ended, because once you find out who and why, you can pretty much figure out the rest, making the last half hour of the film unnecessary. Fiennes is the star and does a pretty good job, but the one who really impressed me was Angela Bassett. She plays his bad ass partner, Mace, and she was really something to see. Strange days is something different in many ways, but it's also predictable, repetitive, and anti-climactic in others. It's a cool film and a different story, but most of the acting is weak, and the story repeats itself leading up to its predictable ending.

Cosmetic surgery game shows, men marrying horses, and redneck buffoons trying to rule the world (all mostly American admittedly). But nothing surely comes close in strangeness terms to the bizarre paradox that we are met with in this otherwise decent film (another from the late night classic collection).The hypocritically odd world of Strange Days is as follows. We are shown scene after scene of apparent chaos, with murders beatings and rapes seemingly occurring on every street corner, whilst our protagonist (and everyone else) drive past with out even a sideways glance. Fair enough, you might say. Why then, does the murder of one man not in any way connected to Fiennes suddenly bring life back to his previously soulless body, forcing him to conduct his own investigation to bring down the evil perpetrators of this savage crime. Maybe its because the victim was someone important, or because he was murdered by police, or because it was Fiennes' own marvelous SQUID technology that caught the incident in all of its horificness. All valid reasons I must say. Yet we are still treated to what surely must be hundreds upon hundreds of violent crimes happening, without fail, along every inch of every pavement and road that we see (and let's be honest, there must be more than a few murders along the way). And herein is the paradox - why would anyone pay even the slightest attention to this murder when the violence that reigns on the streets is barely enough to register in the brains of anybody driving past. Apart from that its a pretty good film.

A new millennium is soon beginning. We are in Los Angeles, crime is rampant and the police is answering with force. The new drug is experiences. One is now able to record what one sees and feels so that one or someone else might experience it later. So want to be a part of robbery, some odd sexual dream, now you can experience it without doing it. Lenny Nero (Fiennes) is the main go to guy if you want an experience. At the time radical political black rapper Jericho One is killed. Nero gets into possession of a tape containing a most brutal and sadistic murder of a hooker he knows. Together with friend Mace (Bassett) and friend/P.I Max (Sizemore) they start to investigate. They soon find out that the hooker has made an experience-tape showing how two renegade cops practically executes Jericho. If this gets publicly known the biggest riot ever seen will devastate the city. And soon more people connected to the hooker is killed. Fearing for his own life he finds a connection to ex-girlfriend Faith (Lewis), who is now dating Philo Grant (Wincott), Jerichos former manager. So as the parting/rioting progresses there are two renegade cops desperately trying to erase any evidence of their crime and there are at least one sadistic killer out looking for Nero, Faith and their friends.I was very positively surprised when watching this. Expecting a average sci-fi action thriller I got a very good murder mystery with the unique possibilities that recording memories entail. The mystery, combined with Nero's troubled personal life, shoots off in various directions, with the feel that they are loosely connected without being able to nail it down. There are a lot of interesting characters that we are able to follow, including Nero, Mace, Faith and Philo. Step by step we see how they connect and why their relations are so mixed up. The movie also includes a great cast, in almost every role of some importance. Fiennes and Basset is very good, Wincott and Lewis great as the decadent couple of Philo and Faith. We also get good performances from Sizemore, D'Onofrio and Fichtner, among others. The movie actually succeed to keep the mystery alive almost right up to the conclusion, when I was able to solve it prior to being shown the answer. Unfortunately that lowers my grade somewhat, however the mystery was kept alive longer than expected which is good. The idea for the story is very good, and the memory-recording aspect is exploited to the edge. A nice exploration of decadence of humans at the same time we enjoy a murder mystery.

The ending (which I will not reveal) is played up to be extremely mind-blowing, while in reality it is quite predictable. The artistic direction is also boring, offering nothing new and exciting for the viewer just giving you the same old violent fiery urban wasteland that has become so clichéd over the years.

Thoroughly depressing and overlong film, replete with racism, sadism, and voyeurism, professing to be making a statement against these while glorifying them and appealing to the worst instincts of viewers. Alien and Blade Runner envision a gloomy future but have redeeming qualities, such as the symbolism of the other in the alien organism or the Biblical undertones in the Tyrell Corporation. This film appears to have no such aspects. If some do exist, they are drowned out in the revolting visuals and sounds. Enough with dystopia. Enough with Cyberpunk. To someone who is weary of these trends in science fiction and who always wished for a brighter future at the close of 1999, this movie rankles terribly.

Lenny Nero is a compelling character, an ex-cop who was kicked off the force for experimenting with the addictive computer memories. As played moistly by Ralph Fiennes, he is sympathetic to the audience, and to a hard-edged limo driver (Angela Bassett).The plot involves the police killing Jeriko One, a black civil rights leader and rapper, and makes Lenney a reluctant hero, swinging him away from his world of cyberporn and fantasies of Juliette Lewis and putting him on a noir-style quest for truth.Kathryn Bigelow (POINT BREAK) gives the film some stylish direction, but I really didn;t like the way the ending turned out.

It showed a 1999 that may come all too true.  I can only guess that because it came out after the O.J. verdict, it was doomed to fail at the theaters. Strange days, indeed. Along with Grand Canyon, I think that Strange Days is a definitive '90s film, showing all the hopes, fears, and life in this retread decade.  It is Cameron's best screenplay, and Angela Bassett steals the show as Mace. Fiennes is perfect as Lenny, and who can forget Tom Sizemore's speech about We used it all up?

I'd been looking forward to it since I first saw the stunning rapid-fire trailer (I'm your priest/I'm your shrink), and I went to see it with a friend of mine. What I went through with this movie was hands-down the best theatrical experience I've ever had. This movie is flat out amazing. The first shot alone is more exciting than the loads of mediocre thrillers that Hollywood tries to shovel down our throats year after year, and it only gets better. The soundtrack is simply mind-blowing- every time I listen to Peter Gabriel's While the Earth Sleeps I get chills down my spine. I feel like I'm sitting in the theater for the first time, watching the credits roll up as this fantastic paranoid adrenaline burst of a movie drew to a close. This is one of the few movies for which I actually remember the feeling I was left with the first time I saw it, even after watching it time and time again, because of the sheer thrills it gives. EVEN when I watched it on the Sci-fi Channel and they cut just about every other shot. It is as satisfying and complete a movie as I could ever hope to see, and the ending, which brings with it not only the end of the world but a promise of the future, provides perfect closure to a great, complex story. The feeling really is there that maybe, just maybe, in spite of our stupid, self destructive existences, we just might have another chance when the century winds down. The question is, where did this film go? It should have revitalized the neo-noir genre (well, vitalized it anyway), and been a large commercial success. But it didn't, and it wasn't. It pretty much went straight to late night cable, drowned among the mindless action and depressing T & A. Why? It's not because it was too grim or too violent, not in the age of Pulp Fiction. Besides which, it had an uplifting ending that should have made it succeed with audiences the way Brazil didn't. It has name recognition now. It stars three Oscar nominated actors, after all, with a probable nod for Tom Sizemore for Saving Private Ryan (but deserved mainly in recognition of his outstanding career). People, I URGE you to watch this movie. It is grim and violent, but it's a satisfyingly human story, as well. However, I guess the only people reading this will be people who have seen it already. What a shame. But this movie deserves cult status, and hopefully there will be more talk of it as 2K approaches.

This time it was something me and a lot of people nerver saw before. After Lenny's magic words Yeah, boot it the movie jumped of with one of the best shots I ever saw (that they didn't get an Academy Award nomination for that is a complete mystery). Never before I felt like I was really IN a movie. When the man dropped dead and Lenny jumped to reality, a lot of people really were shocked. Wow , this movie can't go wrong from now on! And that wasn't the only feel like in a movie shot. The rape-scene a few minutes before the intermission is one that always will be with you all the time. No way you can ever forget that part!While the movie was playing I started to realise that the new millennium Is upon us. It was less than four years or we would be there. And still the movie was science-fiction, although that part came completely reasonable. I really think that one day virtual reality will look much like this in a few years.Also the music was a positive surprise. Not the usual classic-oriented stuff you usually hear but a mix of ambient, trash and techno. After that scene in which it was used Coral Lounge kept pumpin' in my head. The end credits in combination with While the Earth sleeps was/is the best ever so far. One that lets you sit till the very end of the celluloid. When the end credits start, you only could realize you just saw one of the best movies of all time... Or just missed it.What is more positive of this movie? Well, the script is very well -considered. James Cameron did a really good job there (why did he completely blew it for Titanic?). You could take a lot of quotes out of it, and the script itself is brought in a convincing way also. The actors really seem to mean what they say. Sometimes the script lets you think about things. Just listen to Max's Everything has already been done -speech to give an example.After all remains one question Why wasn't this movie such a big success? Under-hyped, too alternative, too violent? I really don't know. A lot of people who also saw this movie almost all agree with me that this is a really good picture indeed. Of all the visitors at the sneak-preview that day (april 1996) the average was about 7,4-7,5 so it could have been a big hit in The Netherlands, wasn't it that it only screened in the four major cities. A strong recommendation is placed here A worldwide re-release at the end of 1999. Don't make the same mistakes as in 1995-1996, because this movie deserves much-MUCH better.

As a former cop turned dealer in one of the sleazier L.A. subcultures, he does strike me as being too sensitive. Seeing him throw up after watching (I should say experiencing) a murder, you might think he came across this kind of stuff along the line of duty. Well, he probably had a desk job and never came out of the house plus he didn't own a TV-set. Who knows, I just found the character unbelievable. Juliette Lewis tries to compensate for her lousy performance with frontal nudity in almost every shot she's in. I think Basset and Sizemore make the most out of this good but not-so-good-executed story, although Basset tends to overact. If visuals are your thing, than by all means, give this movie a try. I myself love a good visual experience (no pun intended) but I'm sad to say there's not a whole lot of it in Strange Days. Even considering its vintage. If you expect to see a great movie (as I did, judging from the general hype around it) you're bound to feel somewhat disappointed. All in all I'd rate it a solid 7 if it weren't for the ridiculous ending. All through the movie we're confronted with an upcoming revolution. Towards the end of the movie, the message of this revolution and unrest is driven home even harder, but what happens at midnight? Yep, no revolution, everyone's cheering.

I was fascinated by both the film's plot and its visual style, and finally had the chance to see it in its entirety on DVD.This film is a gem -- a true thinking person's action movie which doesn't center around a big man (Ahnuld, Sly, or Bruce) with an even bigger gun blowing his way through the bad guys.  Instead, we have characters with complexity and a storyline that keeps the viewer breathless, and guessing, from beginning to end.  Compared to this, a recent success like The Matrix (which some might compare it to) seems merely like a rehash of the tired old shoot-em-up papered over with a gimmicky sci-fi plot premise.I was shocked to see that James Cameron wrote the script.  Considering that I think Titanic has one of the worst-written screenplays ever, it amazes me that the same author could turn in work of this caliber.  Kathryn Bigelow provides direction that is slick, assured, and stylish.  This should be enough to bury the old notion that action films are guy things which need a male at the helm.Also notable is the performance turned in by Ralph Fiennes.  Anyone who typecast him (after The English Patient, Schindler's List and others) as an upper-class Brit actor should reconsider.  He convincingly creates a Southern Californian character on the seedy side of civilization.  The other members of the cast, by and large, are up to Fiennes's standard.This is, without question, a graphically violent film, with some scenes of sexual violence that may make the viewer quite uncomfortable.  But that's the point.  In Strange Days, violence and brutality are shown for what they are, as actions that are repulsive, and not prettified for public acceptance.My only concern about this film is that it may well seem dated in the future.  After all, December 1999 has arrived, and we still have no virtual reality recording devices, nor are there the outbursts of social breakdown portrayed in the film's future.  I can easily imagine some people seeing this film in 2000 or later and dismissing it as the prediction of a future that didn't, in fact, occur.  But, if we can still appreciate Orwell's 1984 some fifteen years after the supposed time of that novel, there seems to be no reason why not to enjoy Strange Days well into the next millennium.

A hooker friend of his Iris (Brigitte Bako) gets in touch with Lenny & she is scared about something & before she can tell him she runs off, shortly after Lenny is given an envelope addressed to him & inside finds a SQUID disc. Lenny hooks himself up & takes a look at it & it shows the brutal rape & murder of Iris, Lenny decides to investigate her murder & why she was so scared when she spoke to him a few hours earlier. What he discovers isn't very pleasant & implicates the LAPD in a racially motivated killing as he himself becomes a target as he tries to do what's right...Directed by Kathryn Bigelow this has a cult following but I didn't think it was anything special. The script by James Cameron & Jay Cocks takes itself extremely seriously & tries to do a lot, perhaps too much. For a start it tries to be a murder mystery even though I guessed the killers identity fairly early on, it tries to be a dark futuristic thriller which is difficult as it's set in 1999 & the year is now 2007 & constant references to the new Millennium really date Strange days & constantly remind me that I'm watching a film & the stealing of people's memories isn't anything new & not much is done with it here & if you were a sadistic rapist & killer would you record your crimes & then send it to an ex-cop? It didn't make much sense to me. Then there's the all to obvious political message about racism & the fact that the LAPD seem to randomly shoot & kill a black man & the threat of riots as a consequence absolutely reeks of the Rodney King incident & I think I'm right in saying writer James Cameron has said the the real life Rodney King incident was a influence on the film, this aspect of the film felt forced & a bit blatant for my liking & rather predictable too & I'd imagine that the resolution of there just being two rogue cops & no widespread conspiracy throughout the department is meant to vindicate the LAPD as they were in real life. Another aspect of Strange Days that I didn't like was the near two & a half hour duration, it's just too long, too drawn out & pretty tedious at times. Having said that it's still watchable & there are some good sequences here although they tend to be few & far between.Director Bigelow conducts things at a snails pace, my patience was being severely tested by the time I had crossed the two hour mark. There's not much to shout about here, the action scenes are small in scale & provide little excitement while the violence isn't anything to write home about either, there is a potentially unpleasant rape scene here though where someone cuts a woman's clothes off with a knife & then rapes & kills her. The character's are a bit dull, the dialogue is profanity ridden & nothing special. There are some really impressive 1st person sequences which must have been a nightmare to film including a great opening scene of a robbery.With a supposed budget of about $42,000,000 & making less than $8,000,000 at the box-office Strange Days bombed big time & that isn't surprising. It's well made but a bit dull & forgettable. The acting is alright but no-one impressed me that much & I didn't particularly like anyone either.Strange Days is an average film, it has some impressive moments & it tries to do quite a lot but it has plenty of bad points too not least a predictable killer, I thought it was alright I suppose but I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again.

Why? Because it is situated in 1999 on the 31st of December. That's right the day everybody believed would be the end of the world as we knew it. All computers would crash, the entire society would collapse and slip into total anarchy, plains would fall out of the sky... Everybody feared the worst, but it never happened as we know now. Everything went smooth. So if you watch this movie ten years after it was first released, you know it is a bit unbelievable. If only they had set the date in 2999 and not in 1999, we would have believed it, because no-one of us would live long enough to experience it.Except for the fact that this movie has a rather futuristic feeling, it is nothing more but a crime movie. It doesn't really have all that much to do with Sci-Fi. The entire city of LA is in total anarchy and the police is everywhere, controlling everything and everyone, without being controlled themselves. Of course this leads to some excessive violence and an ex-cop, now street hustler, even discovers some major police conspiracy. One of his friends and ex-girlfriend is brutally raped and murdered and he has got the evidence in his own hands. All he now wants to do is to find the ones who did it and solve the case.I guess it is just me, because this movie gets a much higher score than I expected, but I wasn't blown away by it.

However, the topics he chose were far too broad, even worse, his views and opinions, transmitted through the medium of the movie itself, were also shallow and lack any sense of depth.If this movie was only composed of the first fifteen minutes and the last fifteen, it would achieve a significantly higher rating.

She is like her ex-husband, James Cameron, in terms of action; only Cameron knows how to complement action with a clever storyline (T1), human conflict (T2 and even Titanic to some extent), and humor (True Lies). Bigelow does not. Her films are rarely good. (Point Break was intolerable.) So, Strange Days is similarly an awful waste. It's supposed to be a satire but it's so excessive and over-the-top and crazy that it's hard to take seriously. I did enjoy certain parts, but overall felt it was a waste. The satire is too obvious -- ooh, drugs are addictive and bad for you and technology is going to be our next fix, wow, I didn't see THAT coming! And talking about seeing things coming - how's the ending for you? It turns an otherwise fairly entertaining no-brainer into a stupid, contrived, totally predictable slasher flick in which the bad guy can never seem to die, and keeps getting up for more.I mean, at the end I was wondering if perhaps the entire film was just one huge satire of itself, and I was going to see co-producer James Cameron appear out of nowhere and start dancing the jig with his (then) wife, and maybe Arnold would show up and sprout some catchphrases before Ed Harris, Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet all started shouting they were the kings of the world and the whole film sunk way down into the abyss - where it belongs.

It merely becomes a kind of extended metaphor for what the movie is reacting against in the world of the Nineties, when it was made.

The climactic New Year Eve scene is excellent, a a scene that might be beautiful and joyous which then erupts into violence and a bloody riot. But somehow the whole film doesn't gel. There are many intriguing ideas simmering underneath but that aren't exploited fully or just felt misdirected, and the plot lacks a tightness in logic or coherence. The film is also excessively long - it meanders a little too much, some scenes are too long (and some unpleasantly so, like the murder of Iris), and a full 30 minutes can probably be trimmed and the film might be better for it.A big problem is that Ralph Fiennes is unconvincing as an ex-cop turned peddler of dubious ware. He doesn't have that look of toughness, slightly seedy world-weariness or street-cred required for the role, instead looking like an Englishman somewhat lost in LA. When the lead actor doesn't convince, the rest of the film tends to fall a bit flat, and accentuates all the other problems one sees in the film.Verdict - could do better.

This film came out in 1995, but is almost prophet like in its ability to summarize our current obsession with technology and experiencing artificial stimulation through computers (e.g. Wii and other interactive games). This film reminds us about the danger that comes along with our constant need for stimuli, and how it detaches us from human contact, desensitizes us to violence, and makes the abnormal seem normal.The great thing about this film is that it came out 5 years before the year 2000 and didn't try to look to futuristic, as far as fashion, and the cars. No one was using a space craft to get around. There are three acts in this film the descent of Lenny into a personal living hell, which is linked with his ex-girlfriend, Faith, who he believes in, despite her penchant for self destruction. Through flashbacks, we see at one point Lenny was a decent cop. Act II is the present time, where we see the seductive nature of the SQUID and the danger is possesses, and how real feelings and emotions are downloaded and traded as a commodity. You also see this edgy undercurrent of end time doom felt by everyone, from the murdered rapper Jericho One, to the cops who feel that the urban undercurrent in society, is asking for a level of respect they don't deserve. Order is hanging on by a loose thread and everyone is trying to escape this reality through the use of the SQUID. Act III, is where the price is paid for murders and deception. The order is restored after chaos ensues. Lenny comes out on the other side as a restored person. Visually, this film is very stimulating, it almost seems like overload in some parts. But this is what the director wanted us to feel, the sense of chaos and impending doom. As far as the acting, Finnes is great, but so is Tom Sizemore, Wincott, Lewis, and of course Angela Basset. She is almost like Virgil to Lenny, guiding him through a maze of hell and hoping he can see the error of his way. She is vulnerable in her love for Lenny, but makes it clear he cannot sacrifice her, or the future of the city, for Faith or the SQUID. This film had a lot on the plate-racial tension, misuse of technology, sex without emotion, and the blur between lies and truth, which were offered up through the media images of Jericho One. He spoke the truth of his reality, but lived a different reality. This film spoke to the idea of media manipulation, which is very rampant in our present culture. We finally make it to the New Year and after the riot, the truth is restored. When Lenny passes out and wakes up again, I saw that as his rebirth. He has known all the long that Mace loves him, but at the end he is ready to reciprocate that love and that is why he beats on the limo glass to get Mace out of the car. The movie ends with a lover's kiss, which reminds the audience, love is an emotion that cannot be manufactured.

The ending does not fit the movie, and it appears that they had no ideahow to end the movie, so they used the passionate, unexpected kissbetween friends as a cop-out ending.  This may have worked if Bassettand Fiennes had more chemistry together.

Strange days is uberrealistic, and forces us to think about ourselves. Those people saying the movie isn't realistic should check their own state of denial. Strange days simply shows what an excalation of rascism, which I believe is currently happening, will do to a nation. And to those who say the script isn't good I have one word sub-plots.

From the technical aspects to the labyrinth plot, Strange Days never plays it safe. Forgive the cliché, but the film breaks all the rules.The time is the final days of 1999 (yes I know the time has long since passed, but this film was made more than a decade ago, and it hardly matters anyway). A new technology called SQUID has been invented, which allows a person to experience what someone else has already experienced. This happens on every level, not just visually, but emotionally and viscerally. However, this technology is illegal except for the FBI (there is a strong allegory linking SQUID to drug use). Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) is a dealer in these experiences, but he and his friend Mace (Anglea Bassett) soon come across an experience that puts their lives, and the life of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith (Juliette Lewis) in jeopardy.Strange Days is undeniably shooting for high goals, and sometimes (especially in the technical aspects) it reaches them. On the whole, however, it falls short.First and foremost, the performances by the two leads are rather flat. Fiennes and Bassett are strong actors, but they are both miscast. Both of them have moments of effectiveness (there is some chemistry between them), but on the whole, they seem off. This hampers our ability to sympathize with them, which distances us from the film. This isn't completely their fault, but neither should they be absolved of any fault either. The lesser characters are well-cast, however. Juliette Lewis steals her scenes as Faith, and Michael Wincott is suitably vicious as Philo, Faith's new boyfriend. Tom Sizemore plays the loose-cannon (as usual), Lenny's best friend Max.From a technical point-of-view, director Kathryn Bigelow displays as much ability as her ex-husband James Cameron. In other aspects, she falls short, by quite a bit. For some reason, Bigelow keeps the characters at an arm's distance, and it's hard to identify with them (the miscasting of the two leads doesn't help the situation). Additionally, parts of the film (particularly the beginning), seem padded.To her credit, there is a lot that she does right. She has a good sense of atmosphere (the setting is almost post-apocalyptic, although it is never explained why things are so tense in 1999 Los Angeles). Most importantly, however, is Bigelow's ability to inject some suspense into the proceedings. Even without the limitations that her work has, she accomplishes something that many directors try, and fail, to do.Do I recommend it? Honestly, I don't know. Forgive me for using someone else's words, but I think Roger Ebert put it best in his review of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. ...I can't recommend it, but not for one second would I discourage you from seeing it. I have something to add to that. If you liked Minority Report, you might like this film. If I had to choose, I'd pick Spielberg's film over Bigelow's, but they cover similar territory.

This is based on the idea of 'recording' your experiences, making it possible to re-experience them later... or for other people to experience them. It takes place in 1999 Los Angeles, just a few days from the year 2000. Racism has come to an all-time high, with riots starting everywhere in protest. One black rapper, Jeriko One puts his energy and protesting into his lyrics, and is soon killed. The experiences are recorded through a machine called a S.Q.U.I.D., on so-called 'clips'. We follow Lenny Nero, an ex-cop-turned-hustler who deals in these clips, and produces personalized clips for high-paying customers. The plot is great, very interesting and it develops nicely throughout. The pacing is pretty good, though the film seems a bit too long by the end. The acting is pretty much all great, with one or two exceptions. Fiennes, Sizemore, Lewis and Bassett are all excellent. The characters are all well-written, credible and interesting.

The very fact that you can't put this film in one category is what makes it all the more interesting for me.Lenny Nero is a lazy, selfish, sweet-talking fashion victim who is not as slick as he makes out. He is in turn annoying, broken-hearted and sensitive.Mace is a strong single mother who is not on drugs, has a legal job and acts as Lenny's unpaid bodyguard, nurse and conscience. She is most certainly the action hero of Strange Days.Admittedly the film does have it's embarrassing moments; Lenny telling Mace that Faith could lift all the hurt and hate up to heaven in one voice, Mace telling Lenny that the Jericho tape could change things before we all go off the end of the road and Max's hair !However there are some brilliantly original scenes such as Lenny talking to Mace and Max after seeing the rape tape and asking Why me ?, Mace kicking Lenny out of her car, the car chase that culminates on the pier, Lenny fainting, Lenny's tenderness when showing Mace the Jericho tape, the look that Lenny gives Faith after the fight in the hotel and of course the now infamous rape.The occasionally corny lines/overacting are a small stain on Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett and Tom Sizemore's great acting. Also the roles of Faith, Max, Philo and others are somewhat over the top. Apparently Andy Garcia and Bono were to play Lenny and Max so how the movie would have turned out is anyone's guess.However it's a movie that deserves more praise than criticism.

Bassett takes a turn playing the Ripley character, a character that has degraded in these days of 'Charlie's Angels' and 'Tomb Raider'.  Lewis goes for another disturbing role, just as shallow as the rest.  D'Onofrio and Fichtner are the usual Cameron bad cops, a misstep for D'Onofrio after his portrayal of Orson Welles.  Sizemore is his usual boisterous self.  Only Wincott offers some surprises.Why didn't Cameron make this himself?  It has his fluorescent lights, characters asleep, POV shots, guns, and gadgets galore, and his usual deep hues.  What I really don't like is the pedestrian use of underwater photography.  Even compared to 'Point Break' it is boring.  In fact, this has loads of visual flair, but no depth.  The ending steals from everything whether 'Abyss', 'Die Hard', Untouchables', and even Cameron's 'Terminator' works.  The first half is engrossing, the second half is flat.  Imagine if 'eXistenZ' had the same budget.That brings me to the SQUID tapes themselves, Bigelow improved from 'Point' to create the most disturbing use of first-person yet.  Unfortunately, while all of them sans the opener are story-related, none have the same energy.  The beginning is the most kinetic ever, just watch it alone.  Not even the car chase has the same power.Overall, 'Casablanca' meets 'Blade Runner' with the intelligence of 'The Thing'.  This film is technical, not plot.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material  "},{"Title":"Excessive nonsense.","Date":"10 April 2001","Score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Someone should tell Cameron that movies which try to out do themselves can't. That's the dialectic of an audience with one hand clapping. Strange Days is a bloated, overwrought flick with a silly action cum nonsense sci-fi thread, a weak story, excessive excesses, and implausibilities every few hundred frames. But, hey, that don't mean it ain't a great flick. After all, that's what Hollywood does best. It's the fact that when the end of this 2.5 hour mind numbing movie finally arrives, we don't care if the good guys win or the bad guys win because we're too busy yawning and sighing with relief. Recommended for film junkies only.

Strange Days is one of the better cyberpunk noir films. With a nearly 2 1/2 hour running time, it manages to stay gripping throughout. The performances are on target, esp. Ralph Fiennes, so convincing as smooth, slick warez hustler Lenny Nero, and Angela Bassett, strong and sexy as ever as Mace, bodyguard and confidant. This isn't a film for the faint of heart there's a great deal of profanity and brutal violence, with a rape scene that will leave you numb. If you're adventurous, however, I'd highly recommend it.

Did we even watch the same movie? What a miscast, badly acted (over acted) mess. On several occasions I found myself swearing at the screen. Leave it out being the nearest translation without offending. It's so bad I don't even think it's worth the effort picking it apart in detail, and I have no desire to seem pseudo intellectual.Basset is really awful. Is this the same woman who won awards for her Tina Turner portrayal? She was awful. The whole cast just didn't convince me of.....well anything. Least of all that they had a long history of friendship. Fiennes is O.K. But at times you can see him meeting his counterparts in the realm of bad acting. Sizemore seems to be fighting for presence on screen and it comes across as desperately aggressive.The kindest thing I can say about this mess, is that it's poor. That's being very generous. "},{"Title":"Gleefully mad...","Date":"28 December 2006","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Director Kathryn Bigelow's over-the-top thriller depicting life on Earth in late-1999 as war-torn hell. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as a dealer in mini-discs which can record human experience and be replayed by anyone with a headset; naturally, he gets hold of the wrong disc, one that could bring down the entire country! Middle section of film meanders, with too many scenes set inside a smoky punk club, but otherwise the film packs quite a punch. Bigelow is a filmmaker who loves earth-shaking action, though too often she forsakes logic for thrills. No matter, as her movie is a one-box-of-popcorn thrill-ride, disturbing only in retrospect. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"so bad in so many ways","Date":"6 November 2011","Score":"1 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" if you like nudity and violence, then this may be the movie for you. otherwise, you'll probably find it a waste of time, and maybe even offensive. personally, i find nudity and violence hackneyed. the acting was pretty bad. i mean, there were a lot of people in the movie. so if a fifth of them did a terrible job, then it shows. the plot was wanting also. the whole world isn't in some drug and alcohol induced riot. people just don't behave this way. then, if they did, there's the national guard. and martial law. where was that ? it just didn't cut it for me, and a poor choice in case you were watching it with a date. my recommendation for a strange off-the-wall movie requiem for a dream.

It felt like there was a good story buried here somewhere, like the movie had been poorly adapted from a Philip Dick novel. But this movie starts out mediocre, gets worse, and by the end is a laugher. The dialogue, characters, and plot are cheesy and clichéd. It's directed and shot like TV movie. The racial and gender themes are tacked on, do not feel authentic, and are never seriously addressed. The surprise was not particularly surprising. And on top of all that, it is long almost 2 and a half hours. Ralph Fiennes is just about always watchable, and Juliette Lewis is topless several times. Other than that, there's very little to recommend here. "}]
