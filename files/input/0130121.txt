People exaggerate the amount of roles where Hugh Grant plays the loveable Englishman. There's only been 3 to my knowledge. I don't really care anyway, as he is brilliant in that role. DeNiro, John Wayne, Morgan Freeman etc generally play the same role in their films and it doesn't put the viewer off.This wasn't up to Four Weddings or Notting Hill standard. The story line let it down, but only slightly. You need to be of a certain intelligence level to find the satire & dry wit of these films, funny. Give me that anyday to the sex & masturbation gags in most films or the childish braindead crap from Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey that that mistakenly falls into the genre of 'humour.'It's such an easy film to watch and enjoy.

When the world of a sophisticated English-born art auctioneer in a Tony Manhattan auction house collides with the world of the New York mob, one expects a universe of comic opportunities, and the movie pays off in spades. James Caan is becoming one of those rare actors who is as adept at comedy as at heavier roles. The script is intelligently funny, and the movie is loaded with riotously incongruous situations. The scene where Caan attempts to teach the debonair Hugh Grant how to say fuggedaboutit in a hood's accent is alone worth the price of the movie. An overlooked delight.

The writing is refreshingly good and Grant's delivery makes it go. Here I disagree strongly with critic Ebert who thinks Grant was not right for the role.My favorite scene, I laughed so hard I had to back it up and watch again, Grant has to pretend in a restaurant that he is Mickey Blue Eyes from a Kansas City gang, and his poor imitation of NYC gangster talk is hilarious. This film has no lasting value but is very entertaining, enough so that I think it deserves an 8. I saw it on DVD, nothing remarkable about the presentation, but nothing wrong either.

Sometimes just the facial expressions on Caan's face brought out big laughs with me.Joe Viterelli is perfect for any Mafia-type story, as is Burt Young. It was a little strange, though, to see Young look like such a shriveled up old man. Jeanne Tripplehorn provides the romantic interest in here.My only complaints were too much usage of God's name in vain, especially for a comedy, and the typical on again-off again marriage plans you've seen so many times in movies for many decades.

He first gained notice as the hopeless romantic in Four Weddings and a Funeral.  Audiences fell in love with his good looks, deadpan delivery and ability to convey hurt.  He was even better in Notting Hill, and added just the right note of foppishness.  But in Mickey Blue Eyes-perhaps because he is miscast-all of these once-endearing traits now seem annoying.  The floppish hair once endearing in Notting Hill now seems to be a distraction.  His repeated use of the word right, just right in Notting Hill, seems annoying here.   Perhaps the problem is that the previous two films were fresh and well written.  Mickey Blue Eyes is neither.  Perhaps it's time for Grant's character to move in a new direction and to once again display the talent he showed in Remains of the Day.Mickey Blue Eyes' plot about an auctioneer about to become engaged to what turns out to be a Mafia princess is okay.  And the idea of using an auction to launder money is fresh.  But the second half of the film goes down hill quickly.  And the supposed tragic ending is too obviously a ruse.The only two saving graces in the movie are James Caan and Scott Thompson.  It's been fascinating to watch Caan move from pretty boy (Lady in a Cage and El Dorado) to real life and screen tough guy (The Godfather) and now to comedian.  Watch Caan's eyes-they seem to be in conflict with the rest of his body, letting us know that he knows a lot more than he's letting on.Thompson, of the Kids in the Hall troupe, shines here as an FBI agent.  He steals every scene he's in.

He decides to propose to his girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn) but she has reservations about marriage as her father has connections to the mafia. In her opinion, this marriage will not work as Grant's character will invariably be sucked into the organized crime life. He assures her that he won't and they decide to go ahead with the marriage. As you guessed it, Grant does become entangled and what ensues is a humorous fish-out-of-water comedy as Grant tries to get himself out of a mess.For the most part, the characters were well played. Hugh Grant does a good job, albiet familiar to other characters that he's played recently (and probably not too unlike his real self) but it was nonetheless well played. Most of the humor revolves around his character and his ability to deliver the lines and timing is very well done. The same cannot be said for Jeanne Tripplehorn's character. She seemed to overact some scenes and others it seemed that she wasn't quite sure how to portray the character. At times, it almost made me feel uncomfortable trying to watch her find her role. James Caan did a very good job of playing the father and in some cases, he stole some scenes. The rest of the actors played their roles fairly well although many of these actors have been typecast as the mafia type character.Although the movie was fairly amusing, there were places that it seemed to drag a little bit. A sign of a good movie for me is how much my mind wanders and this did happen in some places. In my opinion it could have been even funnier but in general it was pretty good.

"},{"Title":"An Englishman among the Mafiosi","Date":"8 December 2007","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" Hugh Grant is in someways a modern version of a comic actor who I have had problems with in viewing Charles Butterworth. Butterworth would hem and haw, afraid of making some social faux pas while pursuing whatever business occupied his activities on screen. This diffidence while mildly amusing could get tedious after awhile. Similarly Grant will hesitate, and stammer a bit. But his English manners, and his good looks make his hesitancy far more easy to accept than Butterworth's. Certainly his good looks have made him an easy leading man type (whereas Butterworth always played in supporting roles).MICKEY BLUE EYES gives Grant far more to be nervous and hesitant about. He plays Michael Feldgate, a highly successful auctioneer at a leading house in Manhattan (his boss is Philip Cromwell (James Fox)). Michael has been romancing a schoolteacher named Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn), and has finally decided to propose to her. Besides causing an unintentional series of uproars in a Chinese restaurant, he is surprised to find Gina less than enthusiastic. After he meets her father Frank Vitale (James Caan) he follows Gina home and learns the reason for Gina's lack of enthusiasm (though not lack of love). Frank is a member of a Mafia family headed by Vito Graziosi (Burt Young), and Gina was always afraid that if Michael and she married he'd be trapped into the Mafia way of life sooner or later.Uneasily Gina agrees to the wedding, with Michael insisting that with her assistance he can avoid any real problems from Graziosi and his gang. But soon the subtlety of the mobsters proves too much for Michael (with or without Gina's help). Graziosi realizes that auctioning art can be useful as a way of laundering dirty mob money (he can have debts paid by having various debtors settle what they owe by buying items the mob puts up at auction). And Michael soon finds he is auctioning art by Graziosi's violent mental case son Johnny (John Ventimiglia) that are setting records - records the F.B.I. are showing great interest in. While worrying about this, Michael is also under pressure of trying to present a good, respectable front for a potentially lucrative client. Somehow the mobsters and the F.B.I. just don't seem to help create this image.Michael finds that everything Gina suggests, or her father Frank tries to help with fails, and soon the Englishman finds he is in the middle of an unwanted killing - one that can set off a mob war. He also finds that he has to parade around town with his erst-while father-in-law as an out-of-town underworld torpedo named Mickey Blue Eyes (actually, Young Mickey Blue Eyes from Kansas City, as opposed to Old Mickey Blue Eyes his dead dad, and the original Mickey Blue Eyes from Chicago!). This includes burying a corpse in an overused waste land, and ordering steak in a restaurant where Mickey is barely understood talking a version of underworld English, and upsetting customers by his anti-English remarks and his constantly dropping his gun.The cast is wonderful, led by a continually drained Grant who can't find any way out of the deeper and deeper hole he is in, Caan who has found that he has a comfortable niche in the mob - but has somehow lost his daughter's trust, Tripplehorn who finds that she is bloodily closer to the mob than she ever expected or wanted to be, Young who is properly sinister but ruthlessly smart, and Fox who constantly trying to put the best face on the worst situations (like talking to his potential client about respectability, opening a door, and finding Grant shaking his behind in front of his fiancé!). Even that late budding comic goon actor Joe Viterelli (who played Jelly in the ANALYZE THIS and ANALYZE THAT films) has a nice moment where he watches a television commercial about a very strong adhesive tape that can even bind people's hands - and makes a note for future reference when he needs to bind some person's hands! Until the last comic twists of the plot, the film entertains, and is certainly worth a 10 out of 10 on the scale here.

If you are looking at this review as an indicator of whether you should watch this film or not, I urge you to ignore the measly mark of 5.7 and take a punt on it.

I didn't actually see Mickey Blue Eyes until 2006, and by then, I knew it wasn't the most highly acclaimed comedy of all time, so I wasn't expecting to be blown away. However, I was hoping for at least a moderately funny spoof movie, and from what I remember, that was what I got. About 2 ½ years later, I've seen it a second time, and while I was still entertained by a good chunk of the film, it may not have been quite the same as before.Michael Felgate is an art auctioneer from England who currently resides in New York, and is dating a teacher named Gina Vitale. He wants to marry her, but doesn't know about her family! She has relatives, including her father, Frank Vitale, who are members of the Mafia, and this is why she turns down Michael's proposal, as she is afraid that if they marry, he will be lured into the world of organized crime! Michael promises not to let that happen, but this is easier said than done! After they are engaged, Michael finds himself involved in a money laundering, and finds himself questioned by suspicious FBI agents, but he must play along with this scheme in order to survive! It gets worse when Gina accidentally kills the son of a mob boss, and Michael decides to take the blame! The first scene in the film that stands out as really funny to me is the one where the owner of a Chinese restaurant stands at the table where Michael and Gina are sitting, and makes sure Gina eats her fortune cookie. For quite a while, the film goes fairly steadily, sometimes mildly amusing, and sometimes more than that. Another major comic highlight I can't forget is Michael having to pose as a gangster known as Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes and having to try and speak with a New York Italian accent! The humour is not enough to carry the film, but there is also suspense, which definitely helps. For probably most of the film, it looked like my second viewing would be like my first, but I found that it started to lose its charm towards the end, I'm not sure why, but I was not left fully satisfied. Anyway, I would say this movie certainly doesn't fail miserably as a comedy, but as such, it certainly could have been funnier, though the story and suspense often makes up for that. There are much worse comedies out there, but I can see why Mickey Blue Eyes isn't as popular as Analyze This, a mob spoof which came out the same year.

Basically in New York, English art house auctioneer Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) proposes to his girlfriend Gina Vitale (Basic Instinct's Jeanne Tripplehorn), but she shockingly turns him down, she explains it is because her father Frank Vitale (James Caan) as well as as her cousins and uncles are a crime family of gangsters heavily involved in Mafia activity. She doesn't want him getting sucked into this world, but he assures her this wouldn't happen, but he unknowingly does become part of a money laundering scheme, before they are even officially engaged, the FBI have him in their sights, and soon enough he is being forced into helping the mob with more laundering scams that he is made aware of, once under the given nickname Mickey Blue Eyes. When one the laundering schemes goes wrong Gina's cousin Johnny Graziosi (John Ventimiglia) assaults Michael, Gina gets mad, grabs his gun and fires a warning shot into the ceiling, but is ricochets and Johnny is accidentally killed, Johnny's father Vito Graziosi (Rocky's Burt Young) threatens to Frank that he will kill Gina unless Michael is killed during the wedding speeches. Frank cannot hurt his daughter, so he confesses to Michael what Vito has ordered, and they turn out the FBI for protection, the authorities make a setup that will see Michael apparently get assassinated in a fake attack at the wedding reception, he is also given a wire to try and record Vito confessing to his activities and crimes in the mob. The plan fails and Vito catches onto the setup, Vinnie D'Agostino (Analyze This's Joe Viterelli) is ordered to kill him, but he accidentally shoots Gina, Vito is arrested while Michael and Frank are in the ambulance mourning over Gina's death, but it was also fake, Vinnie and Gina were part of the FBI's backup plan, and she wanted to teach her groom and father a lesson, in the end Michael and her make up, and Frank is happy for the Englishman to be part of his regular family.

He has been dating lovely Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) for three months and is ready to pop the question. Yet, when he proposes over dinner, Gina starts crying and bolts out of the restaurant. It is not the response Michael expected. But, he learns soon enough about Gina's misgivings. Although she is a public school teacher, Gina is also the daughter of a mobster (James Caan) and the niece of the godfather of the crime family. She fears that Michael will be compromised and drawn into a life of crime if he marries her. Michael insists that he has a strong backbone and will never break the law. Yet, the day after Gina puts on her engagement ring, an ugly and ridiculous painting by her cousin shows up at Cromwell's for the auction. To Michael's surprise, it sells. But, it is part of a money laundering scheme and the FBI shows up at Michael's office. Soon after, Michael's resolve is again compromised....and again and again. Will Michael and Gina find a way out of the mob existence? This film could have been dismissed as a meager mob comedy if not for the talents of Grant. He turns the film into a true winner with his deft touch for humor. Just watch him try to dump a dead body in a trash bag but tell the neighbor lady that he is merely getting rid of all the foods with sugar in his refrigerator, having been recently diagnosed as a diabetic. What fun! Watching him attempt to talk like a Brooklyn native is quite a stitch, too. Caan, Tripplehorn and, especially James Fox as the auction house owner, also play their parts well. The production values are high, as the film sports nice costumes, good settings, and zestful scene changes. No, it is not the funniest mob comedy of all time, and definitely not in the same category as Married to the Mob. Yet, if you love romantic comedies with a twist and/or you adore Grant, you will find this film very worthwhile. Make a date with Mickey soon, very soon.

So we have some of our favorite mobster characters Burt Young (The Last Don), Joe Viterelli (Analyze This), Tony Darrow (Small Time Crooks), Paul Lazar (29th Street), and. even Big Pussy from The Sopranos (Vincent Pastore).Hugh Grant playing a mobster is a laugh a minute, and I just was captivated by Jeanne Tripplehorn (Basic Instinct, The Firm).One of his best.

It may not be thought provoking, mentally or emotionally demanding, but it's definitely on the better side of light hearted comedy - it avoids farce and cliché with some subtle substance and style.

His attempts to conceal his English accent behind a thick and impenetrable parody of mob talk is really very funny. The artist whose awful art is the center of the scheme to launder money by requiring individual owing money to the mob to bid on his canvasses may not be the worst artist ever -- just visit any modern art museum to find stuff that is equally awful -- but it is a lovely conceit. I also enjoyed the scenes in which Caan is ordered to kill Grant and another hit-man is supposed to kill Grant's bride when the implanted blood capsules Grant is wearing as a wired witness for the FBI explode prematurely. Altogether, though not up to Grant's best, Mickey Blue Eyes is a pleasant diversion, better than watching endless reruns of old TV series.

However, he does fill a niche that Cary Grant or Rock Hudson used to fill.  We have enough tough guys like Willis or Eastwood or even Tom Cruise.  So, when we look for someone to be sophisticated enough to be out of the water in a tough environment, we seem to run to Grant.  OK enough.  As for Tripplehorn?  The critics below seem to rip her; unjustifiably so for this movie.I liked the feel of the movie (I liked being in The La Tratorria)or in Hugh's apartment or at the receptions or wherever--the sets were very comfy. I liked the interplay of the characters and the way the cat and mouse of personality and profession were going.  UP UNTIL THE MAJOR FLAW--the point where something so drastic occurs that it becomes unbelievable.  All of a sudden this movie wants to become Pulp Fiction.  Tripplehorn's reaction to the act--out of character for the nice schoolteacher she is.  Caan's reaction to the act--too mild.  Burt Young's reaction to the act--c'mon now, isn't this family instead of a rival gang?  You'd think there would be some talking.So, from that point on, I still liked the characters but hated the point.

But what about the film?The film itself is an utter failure, a potpurri of ingredients that don't mix, accompanied by an amateur director who doesn't seem to be in control of his material. The film begins as a mediocre romantic comedy, with scenes that audiences can't identify themselves with, and actors who have NO chemistry between them.Well, you think, every film takes it's time to get started, but this one never does. The Mafia part of the movie is too cliched and superficial to even be remotely funny, and James Caan never seems to get into his part. Poor guy, he's had plenty of good parts through the years, that in Godfather for example...The plot is incoherent and tries to mix romantic comedy, black comedy, drama, action and tragedy, thus confusing the public, not allowing them to get in the mood. The jokes are easily predictable and Hugh Grant doesn't even deliver them properly. Besides there are some offbeat characters who don't make sense, probably meant to be funny.Somehow all this still is very rewarding. This movie is a failure up on the shelves with Showgirls, Godzilla, Casino Royale and many others. Film connoisseurs will spot the mistakes and talk about them for hours, or directors will watch it as an educational video how not to make movies. That's the pleasure you get out of this movie. I think very few will appreciate it for the romantic Hugh-movie it's supposed to be.

Before I saw it I could not stand Hugh Grant but now I can finally see the humerous side of Hugh Grant.The movie is about Michael Felgate (Grant) who is an auctioneer by trade. The love of his life is played by none other than Jeanne Tripplehorn. One evening Felgate proposes but Tripplehorn blaintly refuses because her father was part of the mob and she knew that if she got married to Felgate then her father and the rest of the mob would take advantage and get him into alot of trouble.Eventually Grant convinces her to marry him. But Grant finds that he is now in more trouble than he has ever been in his whole life. So in the end you have Grant attempting to learn mobster language, dig up an accidental murder victim, sell paintings and make his future father-in-law happy all whilst keeping it a secret from his Fiance.Overall it's a humerous adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat laughing all the way.

MBE constrains him in yet another mold of the stereotypical bumbling Englishman. (Note to self shaking one's floppy hair does not constitute acting.)2.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is woefully miscast.  Her chemistry with Grant as his Mob-daughter fiancee defines implausible.  And she brings a depth to the role that rivals most of Keanu Reeve's dramatic oeuvre.3. Do you like to care about the characters in a film? Empathize with them? Share their joys and silently root for them when they're the underdogs? You'll have to do it in another movie theater.  By the conclusion of MBE, I didn't care whether Hugh Grant had married the Mob or not.4. The best joke in the film? The name of the Italian restaurant run by Tripplehorn's Mafioso father 'The La Trattoria', which translates to 'The The Trattoria'. Enough said.In short...watch Grant in the charming 'Notting Hill'.

James Fox is also good but here his talent is wasted on playing a genial nitwit--in my opinion, both he and Grant are capable of much better.

This is doubly disappointing because the concept is a solid one.  Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) is an effete Brit who runs an auction house in the Big Apple.  Gina Vitale, played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, is the love of Michael's life.  After a three-month courtship, he proposes marriage.  But Gina rebuffs him because, we later learn, she comes from a Mafia family.  Gina does not want Michael to wed into the family because she fears the corrupting influence it may have on him.  Michael insists that he can marry into the mob literally without doing it figuratively, and Gina relents.  Before you can say fugedaboudit, Michael finds himself embroiled in money laundering schemes and body disposals with Gina's father Frank (James Caan.)The comedic principle employed here is the same one used to much greater effect in last year's Analyze This.  By juxtaposing the extremes of mob life with the trivialities of everyday existence, the filmmakers hope that hilarity will ensue.  It doesn't.  There are so many problems that I almost do not know where to begin.  Let us start with the auction house.  Michael's boss, played by James Fox, is a broad caricature who seems shoehorned into the movie for no apparent reason other than to set up a few flat jokes in the final scenes.  A subplot involving a nearly deaf widow who mistakenly bids on mob paintings is laboriously established in painstaking detail.  It is an obvious sequence totally lacking in comedy.  Even greater is the sin when we learn the purpose of this scene - to set up a bizarre and unconvincing death scene which could have been engineered countless easier (and funnier) ways.The movie is simply tone deaf when it comes to comedy.  Michael's proposal to Gina occurs in a Chinese restaurant, where he conspires with the manager to slip his proposal into a fortune cookie.  Predictably, the plan goes awry in standard sitcom fashion.  Meant to be charming, the scene is simply obnoxious.  Then there is the accidental shooting of the don's son.  Instead of serving as the climax, as it should, it occurs early in the film, leading to a bizarre FBI sting which culminates at Michael's wedding reception.  It is a mark of this movie's misplaced efforts that the sting operation is staged and filmed as though it were part of a thriller.  Director Kelly Makin apparently thought we would actually be thrilled by the slow buildup of tension, instead of merely annoyed.Another severe drawback is the screenplay's reliance on broad cliches. Analyze This was at its funniest when it dealt with specifics of mob life, such as the term consigliere as used by Billy Crystal, or DeNiro's observation, I was Fredo?  I don't think so. in response to Crystal's Godfather-like dream.  Mickey Blue Eyes does not possess a single scene depicting Michael's failed attempts at conforming to specific elements of mob life.  There is a sequence in which Michael and Frank must take a body out by the river and bury it.  Instead of receiving clever observations about the morbid task, the audience is treated to a poorly directed shootout between rival Mafia factions.  Time after time, the movie goes for broad, easy punch lines instead of clever observations.Despite its many and massive flaws, I cannot bring myself to give this film zero stars.  Why?  Because it stars Hugh Grant, who puts forth a valiant effort to save the movie from itself.  As Michael, he is always witty, charming, and self-deprecating.  When he attempts to adopt the persona of a notorious mobster named Mickey Blue Eyes by using the accent and lingo of the American mob, one cannot help but smile.  True, the scene plays far beyond reason, wearing out its welcome.  But the blame there goes to the director, not Grant.  Aside from his winning performance, there is no reason to recommend this misfire.  The funniest line in the film, I have opposable thumbs, is delivered by a stuffed gorilla.  Need I say more?

The story is fairly basic - Boy meets Girl whose family are all mafioso and gets caught up further than he'd like - but it's entertaining and keeps you interested up to the end. Hugh Grant is the only one who really does any 'acting' in this film, the rest of the cast are largely supporting Grant as he goes through his trademark 'Englishman in a spot of bother' routines, and so he pretty much drives the whole show, but if you haven't got fed up with that yet then this film delivers.....

Is he capable of building and portraying a character that we believe in? Does he have depth and breadth in his portfolio? Or is he just lucky because he keeps getting offered the same part to play in return for obscene amounts of financial recompense that are absurdly excessive in relation to the value of his contribution to the the human race and the entertainment of the paying customer? (obviously this phenomenon is not peculiar to Grant alone). Is he any different to ,say, Cary Grant or any of the old time Hollywood matinée idols? In this particular movie he gets his inoffensive-but-just-a-little-bit-stupid Englishman out of the cupboard for another big payday. By now, Grant was big bucks in Hollywoodland and so it didn't really matter what he did. So this whole movie is just a vehicle to take advantage of Grant's celebrity. It came out around the same time as a similar kind of innocent-caught-up-with-the-mob-movie called Analyse This, starring De Niro and Billy Crystal. A far superior film in every way. Probably because of the acting talent of the two main protagonists. Acting talent that Hugh Grant just doesn't have. But then up to now, he hasn't needed any. This movie will probably end up in the cheap DVD bin at your local charity shop, which is where it belongs. Which is a pity in some ways because James Caan puts in his usual good performance. At least he has a great body of work to show his grandchildren, unlike Grant who will probably be forgotten long before he gets any grandchildren. There is just one ray of hope for our floppy haired hero...I hear he's popular in Moscow, or at least Annushka thinks he's a good actor.

OK, so it wouldn't win any Academy Awards, but it's still good fun. While the plot does seem familiar and has probably been used many times before, it is put to very good use in `Mickey Blues Eyes'. The acting is standard, but the characters being portrayed are highly likeable. Hugh Grant does his usual routine as the bumbling floppy-fringed gentleman, but is still very humorous in his part. James Caan also plays his most common persona- the friendly, erratic Mafia crimelord. He was well chosen for the part though and does his routine to very good effect. Jeanne Tripplehorn is your typical love interest. She does what she's required to do standing around and looking pretty. Joe Viterelli appears to be the link between this and the similarly themed `Analyze This'. He's believable as the typical Italian-American Mafia worker. But `Mickey Blue Eyes' is particularly funny because it perfectly mixes Hugh Grant's gentlemanly comic schtick with that of Godfather spoof, gangster comedy. The situations are always funny and the plot line never wears thin, making this a good movie all-round. While it isn't outstanding, `Mickey Blue Eyes' is still very funny and pleasing to watch. It didn't have the star power of De Niro and Crystal in the much inferior `Analyze This' but it capitalises on what it does best &#150; entertaining. The end result is very good. I give it 7.2/10.

In The Freshman, a student of cinema meets a godfather, mockingly portrayed by Marlon Brando. In This Analyze, a terrorized shrink is privy to the confidences of Robert de Niro's, a depressive gangster boss with psychopathic tendencies. This time, an English auctioneer tries to escape the influence of a redoubtable and intrusive Mafioso family, centred around James Caan, already on the poster of the first of the Godfather films. Through mistaken identities and blackmail, the distinguished young man find himself embroiled in a series of criminal trafficking activities. The producer of this spoof of the Godfather, Hugh Grant, returns to romantic comedy, a genre which suits him marvellously, in a film where he gets caught up (with his disarming ineptitude) in an art smuggling operation managed by the Mafia. To save his skin, he is forced to play at gangster bosses with an Italian-American accent. In any event, this crazy and unbridled variation on the theme of love, art and the Mafia allows him to return to the role of the clumsy seducer which he made his own in Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill.

Okay, so this isn't a major stretch for Hugh, playing a straightlaced auctioneer at a prestigious auction house. He's decided to propose to his girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn) - only to find out her dad's in the Mafia! What fun! Hilarious hijinks follow, involving miscommunication and mistaken identity. Ok, so since Grant's such an appealing guy and is playing an appealing character, we know he'll somehow triumph in the end. But that's not why we're watching, is it? The thing is, this movie would seem rather pedestrian if it weren't for the performance James Caan turns in as the father. You expect, from the previews, that Grant will have to pass himself off as a Mafia guy to someone - if this were a normal film, that someone would be the girl's father. Not this time! Caan's in on it, and that's where a lot of the fun in Mickey Blue Eyes comes into play. Nothing's funnier than seeing Hugh Grant try to talk the Italian talk! So Caan's tough and funny, and Grant's endearing and bumbling, so that leaves us with only one main character to gripe about Tripplehorn.I'll say it right upfront I've never been a Tripplehorn fan. When I saw her in Basic Instinct, I was almost relieved when Michael Douglas started messing around with Sharon Stone. And when I saw her in Waterworld, I looked for another female character just so Kevin Costner wouldn't have to be with her. (Darn the luck.) I don't think she's very talented as an actress, with a very limited range of expression. And she's not even good-looking, with a hideous overbite that would put a beaver to shame. And that wouldn't be as much of a problem if she weren't in all these movies playing attractive, sexual women (except for Basic Instinct, of course). Watching her slobber all over Hugh Grant made my stomach churn and my skin crawl.But seriously, that's just a minor quibble.

Hugh Grant's stereotyped roles seem to be getting a little tiresome by now, don't you think? I mean, sure his typical role as a stammering shy very polite and good-mannered Englishman, often placed in a Fish-out-of-water situation, usually America, do cause laughs and hilarity at first, but by now it simply isn't funny anymore!However, it must be said, despite Hugh Grant in his all-too-familiar role, the film has tried hard in trying to make us laugh, especially in other aspects. Unlike any other Grant film, this picture does actually take quite a serious and often grim situation and illustrates the funny side of it, most of the humour being quite intriguingly black. But then again, quite a lot of the film's gags are half-hearted parodies of the more serious Mafia pictures, such as Casino, Goodfellas, and (most prominently), The Godfather Trilogy, considering the fact that one the Trilogy's cast members plays a leading role in this film (James Caan, who without doubt gets the most credit in this movie).The film deals with witty Englishman Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) who lives in New York and has a comfortable occupation as an auctioneer for many art paintings. When he asks his girlfriend Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) to marry him, she surprisingly refuses, later claiming that he can't marry her because of her family. Soon Michael is introduced to the family, who turn out to be the leaders of a well-known Mafiosi crime mob, Gina's father (Caan) being one of the leaders. Soon Felgate (nicknamed Mickey Blue Eyes by the mob) gets reluctantly involved in the organised crime world, only to result in drastic consequences...Sure, it is a little silly in some places. And I suppose that the characters do lack a little originality, though if you are a Hugh Grant fan, I encourage you to go and see it. I'm just saying that this is not a film to be overrated.

Things get worse when Michael's auction is unwittingly used to launder money as well as getting mixed up in the murder of the son of another mob boss.I'm not a big Hugh Grant fan simply because I got tired very quickly of his whole bumbling, blinking Englishman routine so I gave this a pass at the pictures.  However I do like mob films and am willing to give spoofs a chance, so on TV I watched this.  The plot is very silly &#150; no surprises.  It goes out of it's way to put Michael in as difficult a position as possible and it goes a little too far &#150; laundering is one thing, but murder is another, and the ending itself is too convoluted to be funny or believable.However along the way there is some light humour to be drawn from this foppish English man suddenly finding in knee deep in Italian stereotypes.  It's never hilarious but it manages to be slightly charming in a silly way.  However the charm wears thin at times and the second half goes gradually downhill as it tries to get hold of a decent plot to make a climax.Grant does all his usual stuttering stuff and is almost embarrassing at times.

Caan is OK but he doesn't send himself up as well as De Niro did in Analyse This &#150; I had hoped for more in jokes etc about Sonny. Tripplehorn is bland and Burt Young is underused.  Fox is OK but only as an English twit.

Art House auctioneer Michael Felgate (Grant) is in love; when he asks Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) to marry him, though, she turns him down, and he hasn't a clue as to why.  What he doesn't know is that her father, Frank Vitale (Caan), is a member of a `family' run by Vito Graziosi (Burt Young), and Gina realizes that if she marries Michael he will automatically become a part of it all, whether he wants to or not.  She loves him, but she wants to protect him from the life into which she was born.  An admirable notion; she will sacrifice her love in order to keep him out of trouble.  Michael, however, is not about to accept her answer without further investigation.  He decides it's time to meet her father.  When Frank finds out, he is delighted, and he prepares to take Michael into the family.  Before he can formally introduce his son-in-law-to-be to Vito and the other family members, however, he realizes some training is in order.  That British accent, for one thing, just won't cut it.  In what turns out to be one of the funniest scenes in the movie, Frank then attempts to coach Michael in the finer aspects of `mob' dialect.  Well, `F'gedduhboudit.'  Michael comes off sounding more like Elmer Fudd on Prozac.  By the time Michael finally meets Vito, he has become `Mickey Blue Eyes,' a connection from out of town, and a man of few words. 	An amiable enough comedy, Makin keeps it all fairly light-hearted, and there are some humorous moments; all in all, however, there just isn't a lot of laughs here.  Grant does a good job with Mickey, relying on his usual stammering and innocent countenance enough to win over the audience.  Tripplehorn makes her Gina just sympathetic enough to make her likable, putting the martyr-for-love aspect to good use.  Unfortunately, there isn't much chemistry between the two;  the performances are satisfactory, but their characters lack that certain something that makes you really want to root for them.  Caan does well in a roll to which he is perfectly suited; in fact, it would seem that this part was written specifically for him.  Young is convincing as Vito, but he really doesn't have much to work with; he looks the part, but it's a thankless endeavor.  Joe Viterelli adds a nice touch as `Vinnie the Shrimp,' and with this one and `Analyze This' under his belt, he should be a made guy by now.  The rest of the supporting cast includes James Fox (Philip Cromwell), Gerry Becker (Agent Connell), Maddie Corman (Carol), Tony Darrow (Angelo) and Paul Lazar (Ritchie Vitale). 	If you're looking for some light entertainment and a few laughs, and especially if you're a fan of Hugh Grant, `Mickey Blue Eyes' will fill the bill.  Though far from memorable, it's not too bad, either; just the ticket, perhaps, for whiling away a pleasant evening without having to think too much.  I rate this one 5/10.

The movie suffers from trying to mix parody, romance and drama.The intrinsic problem is that certain genres lend themselves to being parodied much more easily than others, e.g. horror and action/adventure are easy and concentration camps are tough.   It is very hard to balance the ruthlessness that is the basis of mob life with the light-hearted antics one wishes to see in a comedy.  Analyze This, which was quite good, and Married to the Mob, which was pretty weak, are more successful than Mickey Blue Eyes because everything in the movie played for laughs.Burt Young does a good job as a humorless mob boss but Jeanne Tripplehorn is totally miscast as a mobster's daughter  (Michelle Pfeiffer and Mercedes Ruell are far more convincing as mob wives than Jeanne Tripplehorn is as a mob daughter.)  Hugh Grant is fine playing the role of Michael, the befuddled English romantic, but Michael's attempt to portray Mickey Blue Eyes is ridiculous and tiresome.  Who can't imitate Brando playing Corleone?I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.

Just remember the painful scenes when Hugh Grant tried to speak American/Brooklyn/Italian slang. Or when Jeanne Tripplehorn laughed about the way Hugh Grant runs.Hugh Grant was occupied to deliver his usual acting in his main character. When watching it you can almost forget that he is able to be really funny and is able to deliver respectable acting as well. When an actor is only able to do one kind of character, who cares when it is done well? Did anybody blame Cary Grant for just doing this? Everybody who saw Maurice knows that Hugh Grant is able to act. He is also able to be funny as he proved in Four Weddings and A Funeral. So what was the problem with Mickey Blue Eyes. I reckon it was the script.Who can fight against such a story. And the Co-actors where at a loss as well. James Caan was vague and Jeanne Tripplehorn could also do better.

However when I was watching this, I couldn't keep it out of my head, I kept comparing this to ANALYZE THIS.  It's another mob movie with comedy that works at parts, and is weak in others. Hugh Grant plays Michael Felgate, a Englishman in New York City working as a antique art dealer.  He is in love with a school teacher named Gina,(played by the beautiful Jeanne Tripplehorn) and would like to marry her.  The only problem is Gina's family, not her immediate family, the family her father Frank (James Cann) is involved with, a mafia family.  So Michael wants to make a good impression with these people, and he does it quite well, at first.  Frank is very pleased that his daughter is marrying someone decent.   The family head, Uncle Vito (Burt Young) is also pleased with Michael, and wants to use him for a hidden money laundry scheme.  Then all of the trouble begins, and things keep getting worse and worse for poor Michael. This was a so-so comedy, I was pleased to see some mob jokes being used that ANALYZE THIS didn't cover, and the acting was also good.  Grant is funny at times, but at other times is quite annoying.  When Grant tries to put on a gangster accent, he doesn't sound like a gangster, he sounds more like John Kennedy, which is a bit tiresome.  Cann is decent as the mafia father who assists Michael through his entire troubles.  And Tripplehorn is also good as the confused and worried girlfriend and daughter of the two men in trouble.  But if anyone steals the show, it's mafia regular Joeseph Viterelli playing one of the associates of the mafia.  Viterelli does have funny moments in this film, but not as much as he did in ANALYZE THIS.  But just seeing him again after the excellent ANALYZE THIS is a nice welcome. I did get a headache while watching MICKEY BLUE EYES, not from the quality of the film, but just on the situations that these people get themselves into.  The viewer wonders on how much more trouble can these people get into, and how in the world can they ever get out of it?The reason on why I enjoyed ANALYZE THIS more is because it had actors act unlike they normally would (De Niro crying and making all of the jokes, Crystal being the straight man). Where MICKEY BLUE EYES has the actors act like they normally would in any of their other movies, Grant the bumbling fool, Cann the tough-guy, and Tripplehorn the girl in distress. Overall, MICKEY BLUE EYES is o.k., but not great.  If you enjoy Grant's comedies, then this is one of his better, but it's nowhere as good as NOTTING HILL.  And it's good to see James Cann play a good guy again.  I would reccommend that if you want to see a good mob comedy, then rent ANALYZE THIS. If you already seen ANALYZE THIS, then it's o.k. to go ahead and see this film. But by the film's credits, you'll probably say, it wasn't as funny as ANALYZE THIS.

Actually, I'm not sure if he did turn down the role, or was even offered it, for that matter. But one can - or must - only assume that he was both offered the role and turned it down. And let me tell you As much as I love James Caan, I love Robert De Niro more, and as much as James Caan is a great actor, Robert De Niro just fits this role ten times better. Or even Al Pacino. Who knows, maybe he was offered the role and turned it down, too.Our tale begins in New York City. Michael (Hugh Grant) is a bumbling British man trying to make his way through modern New York. He runs his own auction house, and has been going out with his new girlfriend (the always-annoying Jeanne Triplehorn) for a short time. But Michael believes it is true love, and so in a cheap Chinese restaurant one night, he proposes to her. She turns him down. Soon Michael finds out that she has turned down his proposal because of her father, who owns a restaurant called The Le something-or-other (the joke is that the is French for le, therefore it is the same as saying, The the something-or-other. But this joke is stretched even to the end credits).Michael runs in his bumbling manner over to her father's restaurant, where he meets mobster James Caan. Because Michael is a naive British man, it takes him an awfully long time to realize that Caan is a gangster using the restaurant as a front - har-har, I'm freakin' laughing, it's so funny. (Not.)Caan is supportive of Michael marrying his daughter. I want someone to treat her the way she deserves. Like a fu**in' princess, he says. Let me just cut into my plot summary real quick here to point something out. As is the case with all PG-13s nowadays, they must have one character use the F-word at LEAST once, or else it might be considered unfunny. The only problem here is that we are led to believe Caan is a gangster who doesn't frequently curse. Okay, we can accept that because we realize (a) it would be rated R if they put in swearing and (b) it is not needed (did The Godfather use the F-word at all? No.). But to throw in a mandatory F-word confuses us. Caan uses it so casually - yet it is the only time he uses that word during the entire film. So does he swear or not? It makes the audience feel confused and manipulated. I know, I know, it sounds crazy. Call me a picky viewer, but I like my characters to be real, to be consistent. Throwing in the mandatory F-word makes them feel to me like superficial characters in a story cooked up by film producers. Someone like Robert De Niro can get away with swearing in Meet the Parents because he constantly refers to Ben Stiller as Focker. Here it just seems plain annoying when someone uses the F-bomb once and then never uses it again throughout the entire film. It just seems superficial. If they're going to say it, at least make it punctuate an act of surprise of fear, don't just throw it into the middle of a sentence so casually and then never use it again.The film is simply not funny. The film has some very funny moments (Caan teaching Grant to talk like an Italian-American gangster is downright clever writing and acting), but the rest of the film is sappy and predictable and just not funny at all. Save the rare har-har or grin, this film really accomplishes nothing it set out to do. I strongly recommend 2000's Meet the Parents over this. They are almost identical in plot, but one has hilarious execution and the other does not.James Caan seems to be snoozing through the script, as if he knew it was bad during filming, while Robert De Niro was just darn hilarious in Meet the Parents. Remember, I have tits, Greg. Can you milk me? De Niro was extremely into character during Meet the Parents. His facial expressions, his body language. James Caan just seems plain dead in Mickey Blue Eyes.This is a bad, unfunny film, even by romantic-comedy standards. As you may well know by now, I'm a sucker when it comes to romantic comedies, I find them all very watchable and humorous, even the slight ones such as Two Weeks Notice. But this film just didn't cut it for me.One can only be left wondering how much funnier the film would have been if Michael had posed as a gangster for most of the duration of the film (which is what I assumed after reading the plot summary for the movie). Caan and Grant could have stumbled into gangster operations and Michael would have had to pose as a mafia boss longer than he does in this movie. Once again I come back to a De Niro film much funnier than this. It's called Analyze This. Mickey Blue Eyes comes across as a sad renindition of that film, with streaks of Meet the Parents and The Godfather. Granted Meet the Parents came out a year after this film, but the script for Meet the Parents was supposedly written before this film's script.For ripping off two very funny movies, Mickey Blue Eyes is only hindered when it comes to comedy. Hugh Grant plays up his stumbling, stuttering, bumbling idiot role more than I ever wanted him to (how often do we have to put up with the same characters from him?), James Caan is boring, uninspired and seems asleep at the wheel, and come to think of it, the film does, too.It's just not funny.

It was nice to see Burt Young in movies again. He is much more versatile than just playing Paulie in the Rocky films, and here he does a nice job of playing mob boss Uncle Vito.  But his role and many of the other roles are wasted.  James Caan did nothing with his character and you would think he would have the most to offer as he is part of the Godfather legacy, but he is basically a backdrop.  He did nothing special with his role and really, anyone could have played his character. This is a disappointing movie.Hugh Grant plays Mickey Blue Eyes.  In his everyday life he is an art auctioneer.  But unknown to him, his girlfriend is the daughter of a gangster.  So to take her hand in marriage he has to learn to accept her family and try to steer clear of the temptations they have to offer.  And some of the funniest scenes in the film are when the two lives are meshed together.  For instance when Grant begins auctioning off some ridiculous pieces of art that are border line sacrilege, hearing his comments concerning them and others is funny stuff.  However, that is all the screenplay has going for it.  The rest of it is pure insanity and it is not intelligent enough to make the rest of the film work.When Gina ( Tripplehorn ) starts seeing the signs that Mickey is getting involved in the business side of things, the movie takes the old and familiar but boring path of her getting mad at him without hearing his explanation and then she breaks up with him.  When she should be written smarter in the screenplay and see what is happening.  After all, she has had to deal with this all of her life.  She should see the warning signals and put the fire out before it starts.  Because many parts of this film is your standard boy meets girl, boy loves girl, girl breaks up with boy, boy has to prove himself, they live happily ever after.  All that's really different is the mob stuff.  And they are not really done particularly well to make us appreciate or like that part of the film.  So it has to rely on the romance and it just doesn't work.  Gina is written too unbelievably for me to believe that she has a been a mobsters daughter for 30 some years.  So when a screenplay is stupid, the rest of the movie has a hard time catching up, and this one can't.Hugh Grant is fine as Mick.  But there really isn't much he can do with the role.  It's not his fault that the screenplay is not more intelligent.  I'm sure it looked good on paper Englishman wants to marry Sicilian daughter and comedic complications ensue.  But getting it from the paper to celluloid is tricky and here it ultimately fails.  And for one very big reason, it is not funny.It's not even entertaining.  This is one to avoid.  Too bad, this has the premise of a great film written all over it, but what it comes down to is that this is a waste of talent and a waste of your time.

Directed by Kelly (National Lampoon's Senior Trip) Makin and written by Adam (Little Big League) Scheinman and Robert (The Cure) Kuhn, Mickey Blue Eyes flounders as a soggy fish-out-of-water farce about a bumbling Brit (Hugh Grant) at a New York art auction house who proposes to a pretty school teacher (Jeanne Tripplehorn) whose father (James Caan) holds a high ranking position in a sadistic Mafia family. Since The Godfather made La Cosa Nostra movies a sure thing with audiences, Hollywood has produced a line up of memorable mob movies. Now that most of the big-time Mafioso are sitting in jail, the appeal of the genre has spiraled.Happily, the success of not only Analyze This but also HBO's The Sopranos has given Family-oriented entertainment a new lease on life. Sadly, Mickey Blue Eyes lacks the hilarity of either Analyze This or The Sopranos. The idea of an innocent entangled with the mob, as Grant's adorably clumsy English auctioneer Michael Felgate becomes, breaks no new ground. Moreover, Michael doesn't get to milk as much comedy from his mafia masquerade as Billy Crystal in Analyze This. Worse, the mob gags are both too few and far between to get more than an occasional guffaw. The stereotypical treatment of Italian-Americans as pizza-faced gangsters doesn't help. Ultimately, Makin and company cannot spruce up the clichés that have been recycled ad nauseam.The early scenes promise more than the later ones deliver. Sloppy scripting by Scheinman, Kuhn, and an uncredited Hugh Grant sink this comedy in the wet cement that the mob reserves for canaries. Michael makes a living as the manager for Cromwell's Art House in Manhattan, the chief rival of Sotheby's, but Michael's business poses little threat to the giant. Later, he proposes to Gina Vitale (Tripplehorn), but she rejects him. She fears that the family and her father will corrupt Michael. Sure enough, her fears come true as Frank (James Caan) and mobster kingpin Vito Graziosi (Burt Young, trimmer than he ever looked in the Rocky movies) use Michael's auction house to launder money. While Michael struggles to keep Gina in the dark about his deals with the don, the FBI shows up to grill him about mob ties.Meanwhile, Vito's hot-headed son Johnny (John Ventimiglia) goes ballistic when Michael cheats him out of a $100 thousand dollars, so that he can stop a misinformed widow with a hearing problem from buying one of Johnny's gory paintings. Johnny tries to whack Michael. Ironically, Johnny's bullet ricochets and kills him. Frank covers up the killing by framing another mob. When the truth emerges, Vito forces Frank to gun down Michael at his wedding reception with Gina. The Scheinman & Kuhn screenplay teems with cretinous characters. How can Michael and Frank overlook Johnny's car, parked as it is in front of Michael's apartment, when they lug off Johnny's corpse to bury it. Vito figures out that Johnny died in Michael's apartment, because his thugs found his son's car parked in front of it. Further, the surprise ending is too implausible and convoluted to be funny.Comedy grows out of incongruity, but Mickey Blue Eyes boasts little incongruity. Admittedly, Hugh Grant is at the top of his self-depreciating form. Nobody can match his stammer, his clever witticisms, and appear as fashionably bewildered. Meanwhile, James Caan, famous as Sonny Corelone in The Godfather, doesn't evoke the same presence as either fellow Godfather co-stars Marlon Brando did in The Freshman or Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco. The chemistry between Jeanne Tripplehorn and Hugh Grant never comes to a boil. They have their best moment in a Chinese restaurant when Felgate spikes a fortune cookie with a marriage proposal. The supporting cast is a who's who of Mafia character actors, especially Joe Viterelli who played in Analyze This.Mickey Blue Eyes is not a sure thing.

This time he is the prestigious art dealer, Michael Felgate, a classy, sensitive, loving gentleman with a sexy British accent. The film's successful comicality lies in his playful encounters with the stereotypical Italian Mafioso characters, so often depicted as the ruthless men of honor in films such as The Godfather and GoodFellas.After a surprise marriage proposal to a perfectly enamored Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn), Michael learns it takes more to obtaining a yes than a ring and the promise of a life-long commitment. Determined to get to the core of her unfavorable response, Michael pursues the matter and lands in the middle of Gina's family business mainly money laundering and an occasional murder. Trying to resist an overly enthusiastic father-in-law (James Caan), a fearful and protective Gina, and The Family's pressing business proposals, Mickey Blue Eyes is in for the most costly deal of his life.What this movie lacks in humor, it also lacks in originality.  Mickey Blue Eyes is neither funny nor interesting, and this is evident by the fact that Hugh Grant is the `star.'

Unfortunately, the premise that is played up in the trailer only takes up a small portion of the movie. Because of this, Mickey Blue Eyes ends up being an exercise in wasted potential. This was an excellent opportunity to tweak both the image of mobsters in movies and the image of Hugh Grant as the oh-so-very-British romantic lead. The talents of both Grant and James Caan are all but wasted here. Sure, there are a few funny moments, but many of them arrive courtesy of the supporting cast which features the very funny owner of a Chinese restaurant and an amusing turn from former Kid in the Hall Scott Thompson as an eager FBI agent. But the worst sin of this movie is its utter predictability. I saw every joke coming about twenty minutes before it arrived on screen. And the surprise ending won't come as a surprise to anyone who's ever actually seen a movie before. Bottom line Mickey Blue Eyes is one offer you SHOULD refuse. But if you must see it, at least wait for video so you can fast forward through the slow parts.

"},{"Title":"This is even bad for a Hugh Grant movie.","Date":"29 May 2002","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  Hugh Grant is widely considered to be one of the more aggravating actors working today. He constantly plays roles which are really only thinly disguised caricatures of the same dainty British guy who has managed to get himself in over his head. Like Woody Allen, his movies are also packed full of little good-naturedly sarcastic one-liners which, ironically, are often the funniest parts of his films. In the James Bond films, the constant barrage of one-liners serve to do little more than remove any scrap of respectability from the films and reduce them to childish excursions full of meaningless sexual innuendos, while in films like Mickey Blue Eyes, these one-liners are quite often genuinely amusing, and some of the better parts of the movie. As the rest of the movie will show, however, having successful one-liners does not by any stretch of the imagination make for a good movie.Grant plays the role of Michael Felgate, an art dealer with a stable career and high hopes of an approaching marriage. He goes through his life happily, running auctions at which he sells obscure paintings for obscene amounts o f money, spending time with his significant other, Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn - I'll get to her later), and occasionally dropping amusing wise-cracks. In other words, he's pretty much a regular guy.The introduction of the conflict in the film comes from his efforts to get Gina to agree to marry him. When Michael makes a charming but vain attempt to propose to her through a note inserted into a fortune cookie, Gina freaks out and storms out of the restaurant, telling Michael that she can't, she just can't, leaving him alone in the restaurant and leaving the audience wondering what her intentions had been thus far in the relationship if marriage was so simply out of the question. Besides the botched romance, Tripplehorn delivers an absolutely abysmal performance as the poor poor daughter of the mobster who is just so devastated that she can't marry her true love. She plays the victim well enough, but it's just groan-inducing to watch her make horribly vain attempts to act emotional scenes. Every time she got upset I just wanted to leave the room.The conflict has been thus introduced - Gina can't marry Michael because there are things about her family that he doesn't know about and that she is ashamed to have him discover, which is why she stomped out of the restaurant as though he had admitted cheating on her rather than proposed to her. So after she changes her mind and decides to stay with him just as fast as she rejected him, Michael decides to take it upon himself to get to know her family and thereby resolve any conflict that Gina may have been concerned about.What you have here is a typical formula comedy that unrepentedly feeds off of the stereotypical Italian mafia family, basically stealing the formula from the classic comedies (namingly The Odd Couple, the formula of which has probably been imitated on a plot level more than any other in cinematic history) and adding it to the only bad thing about The Godfather, which is the fact that it presented a tremendously stereotypical account of Italians as criminals. Mickey Blue Eyes does nothing new, but rather adds the typical Hugh Grant character to the above borrowed formulas, resulting in a significantly disappointing comedy.The only mildly amusing things in this film are Michael's occasional witty comments, which are punctuated by a series of painfully unamusing scenes - such anything involving the butchering of a foreign accent or a Chinese restaurant owner screaming at Gina to eat f**king cookie. It's amazing to me that that ridiculous scene made it into this film. For the most part, they at least got their stereotypical representation of the Italian crime family at least partially right. And by that, of course, I mean that they did a god job stealing the traditional hierarchy of Hollywood's version of Italian crime families, and Mickey Blue Eyes does more than it's part to ensure the world that there are no other types of Italian families than this.As far as the performances, not everything was bad. Jeanne Tripplehorn, as I've already mentioned, immensely over-acted her role, reducing her performance almost to farce, and Hugh Grant was horribly miscast from the outset, but there are some performances in the film that are worth noting. Joe Viterelli, who amazingly manages to look decades younger than he is, is back in basically the exact same role that he played in Analyze This, an immensely superior film. James Caan delivers a performance as Gina's mob father that is just about as fantastic as the material will allow, and more than any other, Burt Young as Vito Graziosi, sort of the head of the family, performs so well in his role that he deserves to be in a far better film.It's too bad that Mickey Blue Eyes turned out to be such a spectacular failure, because it works from a premise that could have made for a much better film. In a way, this movie failed in exactly the same way that Hollow Man did - there were nearly endless possibilities, but they were all ignored in favor of the childish slop that you see in the final cut. We can hope that someday someone will steal the premise of this movie and make that better film, but the unfortunate fact is that this is just not the kind of film that strikes filmmakers as something to borrow from.Ah, well...

However,the fact is the macho slobby Mr Willis can act rings round him and has appeared in a number of fine films by significant directors whereas Mr G. has all the versatility of a housebrick and has been in more terrible Britflicks than anyone except Sir M.Caine. Mickey Blue Eyes is an LCN comedy that presumably the LCN were not particularly bothered about despite the fact that Italian - American criminal stereotypes litter the cast.Perhaps their version of the Hays Office considered the movie so nonsensical that nobody would bother with it.Certainly not worth killing an innocent horse for. Mr J.Caan whose teeth,against all natural laws ,seem to have increased in number since he played Sonny Corleone,is knowingly self - parodic in a nauseatingly smug way.He can barely resist winking at the camera. It is a distressing performance,all the more so because he obviously thinks he is being hugely funny Miss J. Tripplehorn has nothing to play with but carries on gamely anyway.Perhaps it was reward enough for her to be cast opposite Mr Grant. The sole purpose of Mickey Blue Eyes was to make money.Cash in on Mr Grant's perceived charm and box office.It has no merit whatsoever,not a single touch of individuality,imagination or creativity is visible on the screen.I have never met anybody who actually saw it in a theatre so hopefully we will be spared Mickey Blue eyes 2.

And this difficulty in his performance (I'll make no gratuitous jokes about his arrest) is due to the awfulness of the script and that he is asked to play way outside his range.Hugh is getting married, but his fiancée (Jeanne Tripplehorn) has a secret. She's the daughter of a big-time mobster (James Caan--who looks kind of weird in this film--what's with the makeup?)! Well, instead of finding this out and flying back to Britain (that would have been best in the long run), he sticks around because he loves her so much and he knows it will work out fine. It doesn't and I knew it wouldn't when, for laughs, he tries to talk like an American mobster--the comedic low-point of the film. It only got worse from there and I could tell by his pained expression that Grant desperately wanted the film to end.I recommend this film to no one. Neither dogs, children, adults or penguins--NO ONE! It's frightfully dull and unfunny and it's tough to spend as much money as the studio did and come up with THIS!

Married to the Mob with Michelle Pfeiffer was better, and though her accent was off, at least she can act, unlike Tripplehorn.Hugh Grant can be good, but this is not one of those times. Also, I think I may speak for quite a few people who are tired of his boyish, foppish grin- that doesn't play into your late 40's and early 50's, Hugh (someone, please inform his talent agent!). James Caan is miscast once again.If you want a good NY comedy, with this theme, try Moonstruck or Married to the Mob. 1/10. "}]
