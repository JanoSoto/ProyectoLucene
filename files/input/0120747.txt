Monica Potter is beautiful, funny and charming as the object of three lifelong friends' affection. I liked Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare In Love but he's absolutely wonderful here. I didn't think he and Gwyneth Paltrow shared much chemistry in Shakespeare but here he has a warm and special chemistry with Ms. Potter. It really looks like they are in love, and I love the way when he repeated his ideal of the perfect woman, they filled in the gaps.This is an underrated but enjoyable romance, along the lines of Sliding Doors.

I expect that far too few persons will see this delightful film.   I was particularly charmed by Laurence's description of the perfect woman and even more charmed when (as if I might have missed it) it was replayed!  The film is worthy of smiles and laughs throughout, with an especially funny moment which rippled through the audience in laughter for many moments into the next scene.  It is artistically directed and edited, intelligently written, and well acted (except when Monica Potter seemed to sound like Julia Roberts -- I can't imagine why she would want to do that).  Interestingly, Joseph Finnes is also outstanding in one of the films that I believe is among the best of the decade  Shakespeare in Love.   I find the implausibility of this is irrelevant -- it's an 83-minute movie that sets out to capture a mood, tell a story, and entertain.  I expect that many will easily brush this film off as cute and sweet but I personally would love to see more films that are as well-constructed and intelligent.

And it didn't disapoint me one bit!The plot is basiclly three English friends meet an American girl within three days, at seperate times, and they all fall for her. First, I was excited to see a romantic comedy set in Britain ... I always look forward to those. And then, despite the ending being pretty predictable, I came to the conclusion that this is definately one of the best Romantic Comedy films I've ever seen.Monica Potter does a great job at Martha, the American girl who's had enough of her life in America so buys the first plane ticket to anywhere for $99, and ends up in London. There were one liners from Martha that made me laugh so much.Tom Hollander is a great Daniel, the rich and spoilt British guy who's a bit of a ladies man, and just loves to get a rise out of Frank. It's by not trying to be funny that makes us love and laugh at Daniel. Hollander does a great job at achieving this.Joseph Fiennes ... is there any criticism you can give this man? He's perfect for the role of Laurence, and that's why it works so well. When you look into his eyes, you can dive deep into his soul, and he has the sort of face which you love. Laurence is the romantic and sensitive character, and I can't imagine a better person than Fiennes playing him.Rufus Sewell as Frank steals the show. Frank is the funniest character, despite how serious he is. Frank, the depressed and failed actor who is constantly getting into arguements with Daniel, will have you laughing your ass off! I can't think of a time when he said something I didn't laugh at. If you're not a big fan of Romantic Comedies, this movie is worth watching, just for Sewell.Stars out of 10  10 "},{"Title":"Fun and romantic - seems right for the genre","Date":"22 January 2007","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Martha (Monica Potter) is single, sexy and she's so sick of her life she's off to London with the last of her money.Daniel (Tom Hollander) is single, successful and after one look at Martha he thinks he's in love.

Clever, feel-good script - really aims to entertain instead of being profound, although it's probably a good idea to lay off the cheesy, over-used lines like she's different from any woman I've ever met and do you believe that things happenned for a reason?.Good line up of cast. Tom Hollander and Rufus Sewell really shines as Daniel and Frank, they play off each other beautifully and show a bit of versatility which is nice (both are well known dramatic actors).Joseph Fiennes was okay - Laurence doesn't really provide much. He's the long suffering lovesick puppy type which Mr. Fiennes has obviously played quite a few times before. He somehow fits in less  naturally here as if he's gone straight from a stage production and hasn't really got time to shake off the character. Very good vocal (still got the elizabethan twinge in it)and not much facial expression. I do enjoy the idiosyncracies like Laurence drawing something whenever he feels stuck in the middle. And how he's occasionally being called Florence.Monica Potter provides a very Julia Roberts style performance, which isn't saying much of her own quality as an actress.I was watching this movie with a roomate the other day and she said It's a movie that makes you want to fall in love - I myself was just looking for a comedy and was getting it just fine from this movie.

I think it's obvious that it won't change your mind or your life, won't make you cry or laugh (OK, you can smile sometimes), won't be successful, won't be anything. It's just a movie, an ordinary movie in such a competitive world.Here in Brazil, a competitive place too, I went to one multiplex (I hope that's the name for these theatres with 7, 8, 9 (...) screens there) to watch Teaching Mrs. Tingle (I'm really embarrassed now). Unfortunately, the movie was sold-out, I had already watched The Sixth Sense twice, I really didn't want to watch Bowfinger, the teen-trash American Pie again, the horrible End of Days, and the most horrible Letters from a killer. So, I tried the unique watch-able movie there, the unique romance, the unique that still had some tickets in that competitive world Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence. The Brazilian name, Mero Acaso (in a free translation, Mere Chance or Pure Fate) is one good summary for this movie about one American woman that moves to England and, by fate, develop three relationships with three guys. These three guys are friends but they don't know that they're seeing the same woman. Interesting? Not very much. In fact, the original title tells the story. I watched it without knowing that she would meet the three, so really enjoyed. It was relaxing, fast, cute, romantic but like films made for television. No big plot, no big camera moves, no big cast, no big musics, no big budget... (although some of the best movies I've ever seen were very cheap). And it had some awful stereotypes the American girl was blond, feminist, modern, on (bad) fashion, colored, with a huge suitcase. The British guy was shy, out of fashion, polite, bla, bla, bla. It's perfect to watch at your house eating popcorn. The truth is that I'm lucky. This movie is much better that Teaching Mrs. Tingle, at least. Thanks God that we live in a competitive world!

First of all the direction is choppy and the story rather nonsensical which is often the case for a rom-com but they should be based in some sort of identifiable reality, this isn't. All that would be forgivable if you were enchanted by the central character. Monica Potter is a decent actress and what could best be described as goofy in the lead but to make this story of three men instantly captivated by one woman work that woman would have to be entrancing like a young Audrey Hepburn or Margaret Sullavan loaded with gossamer charm which Potter is not and it's a flaw that the movie can't overcome. None of the men are fleshed out but Fiennes does provide a suitably centered and conflicted protagonist, Tom Hollander and Rufus Sewell are wasted however.

Instead of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, The Very Thought of You gives us boy moons over girl, girl exploits and then blows off boy, girl throws herself at second boy, second boy shows all the genuine interest of a big Judy Garland fan, girl meets cute with third boy, third boy finds out that acting like Billy Crystal from When Harry Met Sally doesn't actually work with women, girl guilts second boy into giving her another chance, girl runs away from second boy and then runs back to him. Oh, and boys 1, 2 and 3 are all lifelong friends, which girl doesn't discover until it's far too late.All that's rather convoluted and the sequence of events and the behavior of girl and her three boys often doesn't hold up under scrutiny, but it's certainly different and more involved than what you usually get in a romantic comedy. These filmmakers were so focused on being unconventional, though, they forgot that rom-coms live or die on two very simple points.1. Does the audience want to see boy and girl get together?2. Can you keep them from getting together until the end of the movie in an entertaining way?These filmmakers never answer those questions in the affirmative, nor do they seem to even understand those questions are being asked in the first place.Martha (Monica Potter) is a Minneapolis girl who flies to London to escape a life of quiet desperation. In short order she meets Daniel (Tom Hollander), who moons over her; Laurence (Joseph Fiennes), who responds to her overt flirtations with all the energy of a damp sponge; and Frank (Rufus Sewell), a miserable git who wants to bed her out of spite but whose wooing technique is only slightly more advanced than dipping her pigtails in the teacher's inkwell.In truth, you can see the potential for a successful rom-com here. Monica Potter is more than cute enough and Tom Hollander and Rufus Sewell are appealingly pathetic as the obstacles that get in between Martha and Laurence. Joseph Fiennes is sort of a dud, but that's more because Laurence is such a dud. What keeps The Very Thought of You from being even marginally effective are some really terrible storytelling decisions.To start with, Martha and Laurence don't even meet each other until you're nearly halfway through the film. First the movie is all about Martha and Daniel, then Martha and Frank, then it focuses on just Martha before finally getting around to the two people who are supposed to get together at the end. By that time, however, you really can't give a crap. You've seen too little of Laurence to care what happens to him and you've see too much of Martha to believe it when she swoons over him like a 1950s teenybopper over Frank Sinatra.This film is also a bit nonlinear, showing us Daniel and Frank's encounters with Martha and then jumping back in time to show us what was going on with Laurence and Martha at the same time. It's not confusing to the audience, but these filmmakers must have lost track of what was going on because there are at least a few occasions where characters act like they know things they shouldn't have learned yet in the story. In particular, Laurence's decision to run away from Martha for the first time doesn't make any sense based on the information available to him at that moment.And while I've already mentioned it, let me emphasize how weird it is that when Martha falls head over heels for Laurence, he responds to her for a long time like a gay guy who hasn't yet come out of the closet. When Laurence finally starts showing some interest in her, it's so abrupt and total a change that it's like he got a steel bolt shoved into his brain that altered his personality.This movie isn't as painful to sit through as some disastrous rom-coms I've seen, but you won't care a whit if boy and girl get together, stay apart or get kidnapped by clowns and forced to perform a geek act in the carnival.

I was in full knowledge of it being a self-proclaimed 'British/American romantic comedy with a twist', whatever that means, but I honestly took my seat at the theatre half-expecting to sleep the way through it.Boy was I wrong!?!?This is not a flawless movie, far from it. On the downside it felt a way bit simple and sometimes dangerously close to becoming a generic movie but it actually did a great job in walking the tightrope.The pacing, it must be said, is brilliant as it does a great job of telling you full four stories and establishing multi-layered relationships between 3 best friends from Britain and a young woman from America with such ease that you feel like you've known them forever. The acting is spot on, although credit must be given to Rufus Sewell who owns this movie as the unfortunate Frank, whose like me! like me! plea warms my heart every time I see it!The music is great, the lighting is terrific and somehow, over a period of 30 minutes, this movie manages to create and establish a scenario so perfect that every man and woman will emerge from the cinema wishing they were there. Of course, not all is gold that glitters and as such the scenario more or less crumbles throughout the story but the main theme in the movie is this; it's there and if you keep your eyes open it just might happen to you.Of course, 'happen to you' is the easy part. What's hard is trying to make it work all the way, i.e. not just catching the ball but actually carrying it all the way into the end-zone. Which is where the story gets interesting.I advise anyone who doesn't have any prejudice against romantic comedies to go see this one, as it will surprise you. No, it's not the movie to end all movies, nor is it a piece that will change your outlook on life, but for 90 minutes it will make you forget about all your worries and just enjoy yourself laugh, smile, hold hands, wish you were holding hands, feel loved or love someone or both, and eventually walk out into the real world feeling like you've experienced a piece of bliss that has made your day a good one.Give it a try, it's not big but it might bite you.4/5.

The conceit of this film - a girl who has her back to the wall and nowhere to go and simply gets on a plane to go somewhere, anywhere - has very much the feel of other movies in the genre such as French Kiss.

That was the year Fiennes was seen in this semi-charming romantic trifle, the costume epic ELIZABETH (as Robert Dudley with whom the title character had a complex relationship) and as the title character in the rare but deserving comedic Oscar winner, SH*KESPEARE IN LOVE (which also won Oscars for Gweneth Paltrow, his leading lady and Judy Dench as an older Queen Elizabeth - but then new kid on the block Fiennes wasn't even nominated).The pace of THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU - or, as it was originally called, Martha - Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence (which can't quite decide if it's a buddy film or a romantic comedy) will drive some viewers up the wall, but those who stick with it for the joy of the contrasting boy/men buddies circling around the charming Martha and structure will be rewarded with a pat ending which is the very definition of a sure fire date movie - then go back and have a look at the hilarious WHAT'S UP DOC? that they stole it from.The key to both the movie's success and failure is probably the casting of the four putative leads. Martha, the film's McGuffin around which the thin plot turns is a generic blonde pixie indistinguishable from half a dozen delightful others, in this case Monica Potter, whose only problem is that there are too many other talented actresses just like her. The three best friends she meets and entrances are, in order, the blond, wealthy but shallow Daniel (Tom Hollander - more people probably saw him that year in support in the gay themed BEDROOMS AND HALLWAYS), author of the grand romantic gesture she will copy before the film's over, the struggling, competitive actor Frank (Rufus Sewell - a Tony nominee on Broadway for Tom Stoppard's ROCK & ROLL, here doing a remarkable imitation of a young Ian McShane!) and the insecure intellectual bridge instructor Lawrence (Fiennes). You'll know 30 seconds after she meets him who Martha's going to wind up with, but if the ride is worth the trip (the flashback in the psychiatrist's office structure is a television oldie but goodie) the audience will come away happy.Nothing terribly original here, but once it gets rolling the actors are fun to be with. Limited pleasures, but real. Worth taking a chance. I'd be willing to bet anything with Fiennes would be; even in a minor piece like this, this is a star persona that demands attention.

Seeing that these movies were cheap and all, I decided to watch it because it's Monica Potter, and what can I say, no one should turn down any film with Monica Potter in it! After saving it for a rainy day, I popped it into the old video recorder and watched. And may I say, my eighty-three minutes were well spent.The whole plotline seemed sequential and well-drawn at first, but when I realized that some parts were not in chronological order, I seemed to have assumed that it was not to lose the interest of the viewer. I didn't lose any interest, because I mainly focused on the characterization of these three men that practically grew up together. When I saw all three of them congregating at the restaurant, I couldn't possibly tell how these guys got along. Fiennes character caught my attention the absolute most because he was downright miserable, dismal, and incredibly similar to a William Thacker (for those of you that don't know, see Notting Hill) except for the fact that he didn't own a bookshop and that he taught bridge to old ladies. It kind of gives me an impression that his experiences are similar to mine; he never travels that much. Rufus Sewell portrayed a washed up, unemployed actor that seems to always have a rain cloud over his head. Nothing ever good seemed to come out of his life. And then there's this other guy that plays the role of being this famous, pompous moron that is responsible for being some sort of manager, producer or coordinator. He bored me simply because he lacked the basic fruits of life (intelligence, charm, and morals). I would have personally liked to have seen him get picked off in the middle of the movie. It's a shame that the writer did not create this elaborate fight scene which would have been similar to Bridget Jones' Diary.And then, there's the stunning and intriguing Monica Potter that plays the role of Martha, this completely wonderful and dazzling optimist who decides to fly to London (firstly, because it only cost ninety-nine bucks, and secondly, to start a new life). But in her case, she does not seem to have any luck due to the fact that she is, in a sense, dissatisfied with Britain. In all my regards, I consider her to be the scene stealer of the film, and I would have liked to see more of her.On the cover of the box, they say that this is a sexy, romantic comedy. The only problem that leaves an abrupt question mark is, where the hell is the sex? Why would they call it sexy and a romantic comedy if there was no bloody sex? Important element in a romantic comedy script there has to be a sex scene in order to characterize it. All romantic comedy writers know of that. But it didn't disappoint me in any manner.All in all, the comedic delivery, the irony, and the entire plotline were the only things that kept the film alive. The film's charm and cinematography was what kept me from not hating this film. I could not believe the ending, because it was one of those endings that someone would have never expected. It's a delightful romantic comedy and I strongly recommend for Monica Potter fans and other lovers for a rainy day!9/10 (Or a B average due to the wonderful characters and the crazy storyline. The only thing it lacked was the romance in the romantic comedy.)

It is a pity that this movie has not been seen in my country, Argentina, and according to my thought, in any other country of Latin America. Precisely alone in Spain. But well, I had the opportunity to see it and I am not sorry.  The movie begins when Lawrence (Joseph Fiennes) takes a psycological session where he talk about he, his two friends and a person that they have in common. Martha (Monica Potter), an American young girl, travels to London to make her new life. There, in the same flight, she will know Daniel (Tom Hollander), a young man that will fall in love at first sight of her. Then, Martha will know in a park to Frank (Rufus Sewell), an actor with bad luck in the love, that also will fall in love of her. But Martha doesn't like to both. Alone she will fall in love at first sight with Lawrence, to who she will know accidentally in the airport. Lawrence, a young man serious but a little clumsy, will also fall in love with her. But Martha doesn't know that three guys that she met at same time are friends. How will react when she know the truth??? This movie has a resemblance to the typical American romantic comedies, being in fact an English movie. But I really recommend it for anyone. It is such a simple movie that it will catch you from the beginning until the end. It should not really allow it to happen. The performances of Potter, Fiennes, Hollander and Sewell are brilliant, but I have heard many complaints with that the character of Potter could have been interpret better by Julia Roberts. For my, Potter is quite well in this movie. It is a pity, but this movie should really have been watched here in Argentina and Latin America of Spanish Language.  My opinion A great movie, Really if you have the opportunity to see it, it doesn't waste it, will see it. Amusing, pleasant, funny, a great romantic comedy. Don't get lost it.

Granted, I haven't seen a whole lot of British television or film, but it seems that everything I have seen has been either outlandishly funny or suicidally dramatic.  English romance always seems to fall under the second, and sometimes numbingly depressing, idea. How wonderful, then, that I should run into this quiet little movie, which, although I will admit that Boise, Idaho is not the largest outlet for foreign film, I don't remember ever being released in my area.  I remembered Mr. Sewell vaguely from Hamlet, and have longed to see Mr. Fiennes in a film since Shakespeare in Love, but never remember seeing Ms. Potter in anything, and I am sure that I never seen Mr. Hollander before. While I would not lie and say that this is a profound film and that there is anything to be learned from it or much to be thought of after seeing it, it would be only natural to praise it for its pure movie-like, feel-good quality, a small escape from the everyday.  It resembles little, other than the highly implausible plot, of a Hollywood film.  American romantic comedies seem built according to specifications designed only to provoke that slightly nervous, overly sweet feeling in the majority of female audience members.  They usually have all the weight of a Twinkie, and leave one wondering how something so simple could be so utterly manufactured. This movie is more like a Wheat Thin, possibly underrated, certainly rather bland looking, but somehow much more satisfying and although it comes salty or in low sodium flavors, is surprisingly sweet without a trace of gooeyness.

Everyday he meets attractive women but falls in love with Potter at their first encounter.

Not only is he gorgeous, but he's the most talented, believable actor out right now. English actors are just IT for me. I'll take Joseph, Jude, Colin (Firth), Rufus, etc., over any of these American cookie cutter nonsense actors (Ben Affleck, Mark Wahlberg, etc). Joseph Fiennes is simply amazing! His eyes speak volumes. You feel as if you are gazing into his soul and... *ahem*... well, onto the story... This is a delightful and refreshing comedy. Even though the plot of three best friends falling for the same girl in less than two days is slightly unbelievable (aren't they all?), it still works. It was pulled off as realistically as it could be. Monica Potter's quirky character wasn't too annoying, which was a welcome change. With these types of movies, I am often left wondering, What was so great about her?, but I didn't feel that way about Martha. Her converse sneakers had to go, and she drank too much, but she was charming nonetheless. Joseph, on the other hand... absolutely no complaints with him or his character, Lawrence, except to say that I wish he would have had even more screen time. Rufus was hilarious. He had some of the best lines in the movie. This review probably hasn't been too helpful, so I'll end in this way... this is one of the best modern romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. It's extremely witty, the acting was great, there was actually chemistry between all of the characters, the storyline is fairly original, Joseph Fiennes is in it, etc. So, take some time out to see it!

By coincidence she meets 3 friends, all at different times, who all fall head over heels for her. Joseph Fiennes, later to hit it big in 'Shakespeare in Love', is also good.

Monica Potter was reasonable. Production values were fine - it looks like a regular film with an OK budget, and the camera work etc. were all fine for a B movie. The plot wasn't in any way credible and despite the premise that three guys are attracted to one girl there didn't seem to be any chemistry between anybody at all.

Yesterday was such a day. I finished watching this movie which I'd started watching a few days ago, back when I was of the opinion that romantic movies were just lovely. I have two major bones to pick with the entire oevre and they both relate to the same basic concept, the indoctrination of helpless saps like me with bullshit romantic shite like this.1. Being a helpless girlie who's just a little bit crazy and whines about how hard her life is will not cause all men within a hundred foot radius to fall in love with you no matter how perky your nose/breasts are.2. That thing! That thing with the meeting and the moon eyes and the first date sex and the brief comedy misunderstanding leading to the immediate reunion and forgiveness cause you're just both so much in tune. It doesn't happen! And if it does why does it never happen to me!? I hate to be a cynic but I am one of those people that thinks if Romeo and Juliet hadn't offed themselves they probably wouldn't have lasted a year.It's not that I want to believe that. I wasn't born cynical, I was turned. I am a bitter romantic. I went out into the world all doe-eyed and hopeful and offered myself up on the bloody alter of love and rather unsurprisingly, I got butchered. I wasn't prepared. They should make you watch Witness and that Jennifer Connelly movie with the double ended dildo and The Ice Storm before you hit puberty instead of crap like this.  "}]
