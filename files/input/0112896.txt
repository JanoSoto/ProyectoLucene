For me, the gags herein worked, there were reasons for their having been used and therefore makes it funny to me.  The storyline didn't stall, the gags weren't desperate for laughs, and the acting was exactly what was needed the comedic touch.  The casting choice to have Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck, both veterans of the TV series Wings, was brilliant because the chemistry between their personalities was proven and honed before the movie.  The choice of Leslie Nielsen for the titular role was dead-on.  Someone that has the wisdom of centuries (decades, whatever), is cunning (a la the Naked Gun series), and above all, never gives up (until turned to dust).  Mel Brooks, having proved his comedic prowess with films like Young Frankenstein, comes through in the role of Van Helsing.  Even the incidental characters seem to have a reason to belong and flow in the movie, like Essie, the guardian of Mina, or Martin, Dr. Seward's right-hand man of the sanitarium...Martin  ...the patient in the west wing?  He's havin' a conniption fit.Dr. Seward  Oh.  Give him an enima.As stated, the movie will most likely be quite funny or very dull, depending on what the viewer expects from it beforehand.  Being that I like a good slapstick comedy (and I do), the performances above all are what were able to pull me in.FOOSH-TAA!Dracula Dead and Loving It gets 9 of 10 stars  "},{"Title":"Dracula Dead and I'm loving it!","Date":"18 November 2003","Score":"61 out of 64 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Mel Brooks, one of my favorite directors of all time, he's delivered some of the most memorable comedies Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs, The Producers, High Anxiety, Blazing Saddles, Robin Hood Men in Tights. He now brings us Dracula Dead and Loving it, one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I know there is a bit of hate for this movie because a lot of people say that Mel lost his touch and this isn't as funny as his older films. Let's face it, Mel peeked pretty early in his career with Young Frankenstein, which is one of my favorite films of all time, but everyone is naturally going to compare every film that he made at that point with his greatest movies. But if you seriously are telling me that there was not one scene that you didn't laugh at then you need your funny bone checked.The year is 1893, solicitor Thomas Renfield travels all the way from London to Transylvania to meet an important client. As he nears the end of his journey, the sun sets, and the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further. Kindly villagers plead with him to turn back, but Renfield explains that he is expected. Renfield arrives safely and meets Count Dracula, a charming but rather strange man who is, of course, a vampire. Dracula signs the papers finalizing the purchase of Carfax Abbey in England, and Renfield retires for the night. He wakes up when two Brides of Dracula come gliding seductively in. Dracula then casts a hypnotic spell on the suggestible Renfield, making him his slave. Dracula and Renfield soon embark for England. He goes ashore, leaving Renfield behind. When Renfield is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a lunatic asylum. Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next.Dracula Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper! 8/10 "},{"Title":"Honestly one of the funniest films I've ever seen","Date":"10 April 2002","Score":"72 out of 99 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Dracula Dead and loving it (1995) has to be one of the most if not the most underrated Mel Brooks comedy. As inspired by Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, this movie is part of the absolute highlights in the career of Brooks. I didn't like Robin Hood Men in tights (1993) half as much. It had some good moments here and there and couple decent laughs but overall it left me pretty disappointed.Dracula Dead and loving it was phenomenal, script was so hilarious almost every joke hit the bullseye. I didn't expect much when I started to watch it for the first time couple of years ago. Critics made this one look like a waste of time and that's what I afraid it would eventually be. Surprisingly I found myself rolling on the floor laughing like a maniac. I watched it again almost immediately and I was laughing to its ingenious and outstanding humor days and days afterwards.I mean how can they possibly make this classic story look so damn amusing and ridiculous? I love the terrific cast. Lelsie Nielsen makes one of the wittiest performances of his life as Count Dracula. Next year he played the leading role of almost unbearable Spy hard. I guess he already gave everything he got in this film and had nothing left to make the audience laugh anymore.Peter MacNicol is wonderful as Renfield and Mel Brooks steals the show in the scenes where he plays Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Dracula Dead and loving it is absolutely sensational parody masterpiece and I simply can't understand people who seem to find it bad. Definitely one of the funniest films of the 90's. If I have to list the most funniest movies I've ever seen in my whole life, this one will most certainly be mentioned too. 10/10.

If you are not familiar with the original story of Dracula, as well as seeing both the Bela Lugosi and Gary Oldman movies, with others in between, then the gags will be lost on you.People have rated that Brooks is losing his touch.  Not so.  His audience is losing touch with his level of intellect.  A send-up's gags are only funny to those who recognize the source, and realize the play of the situation taking place.  In Spaceballs, for instance, the final conflict between Helmet and Lonestarr, Helmet makes a play on the Luke I am your Father scene from Empire Strikes Back.  But if you have never seen that film, you won't know that, and so the line I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate would be lost on you totally.The acting is great in the movie.  Those attacking the bad British accents should refer to other Dracula films to understand the joke.  In oother Dracula films, accents come off as so fake, it's painful to watch, and that's the joke.  The style of the film itself takes heavily from the Bela Lugosi version, in its design and arrangement of characters, though references to the Oldman film are used as well.  Leslie Neilson did a great job in the role of Dracula, and his Renfield, Peter MacNichol, was a superb performance.This movie deserves full credit for its level of parodistic comedy, even if it is lost on viewers.  If you can't stand this movie, or find it unentertaining, then maybe you don't understand its roots well enough to appreciate it.

Some of the highlights are Leslie Nielson, with whom the torch of modern comedy rests safely for being absurd yet sublime in his characterization, his superb imitation of Bela Lugosi's mannerisms and speech enhance his comedy. The film also is surprisingly faithful; to the novel and has many inside jokes.  Harvey Korman, Peter MacNicol, and Mel Brooks all lend a hand in the lunacy.

While still displaying appropriate atmosphere and thematic technique, this film just simmers with good, old-style Mel Brooks comedy, and is hilarious throughout. For starters, the script is well written, and contains a nice mix of simple gags and more subtle comedy. Similarly, while the movie is clearly satire, it displays more than enough original material to warrant genuine praise. As is often the case, however, all these facts pale in comparison to one simple truth the performers MAKE this film. Leslie Neilsen and Mel Brooks shine as two of the major characters, while smaller gems are found in the performances of Steven Webber and Peter MacNicol; truly, MacNicol's performance is unbelievable, and is a testament to his range as an actor. Bottom line, this is simply a lovely film, and deserves much more respect than it has been given, both commercially and critically. If you haven't, do yourself a favor, and watch this movie, although you might want to watch a handful of the classic Dracula films first, just for comedic context. Enjoy!!

The problem is this was supposed to have been a Mel Brooks parody with lots and lots of belly laughs. You have to believe that the material was ripe for a Mel Brooks farce, but yet the magic is missing, it seems, and many of the gags and dialogue is forced, not exactly as funny as it should be. The cast, God bless them, give it a 110%. Especially Harvey Corman as Mina's father, Sanitarium doctor, Seward. My favorite gag would definitely be Lucy's staking with all the blood exploding all over poor Steven Weber's Jonathan Harker. Brooks has these two long-in-the-tooth dances between Dracula and Mina(Amy Yasbeck, surprisingly given little to work with). Nielsen, in particular, doesn't have as many strong comedy dialogue scenes he's famous for in other more successful parodies. His scene, for me, that was the funniest is a sight gag where he's in bat form flying towards Lucy's room when she closes her window and his face plants face-first into the glass. And, the most unfortunate crime committed is not giving the likes of a very talented Mark Blankfield more of a part as Renfield's security guard Martin. Lysette Anthony is positively delicious with her heaving bosom and seductive qualities as Lucy. Interesting enough, Lucy's role in this film is stronger than the character of Mina. Peter MacNicol hams it up without restraint, and rightfully so, as Dracula's fly-eating maniac slave Renfield. The cast have such colorful expressions and can sell even the most mediocre of written word, and in this movie's case they earned their paychecks and then some. Brooks slurs with a heightened accent as Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Actually, there are some impressive sets and the art/production design is rather stunning, not to mention, there are some inspired camera shots(such as the awesome look of Harker, Van Helsing, and Seward heading up to the chapel where Dracula carries Mina at the end, a faraway silhouetted shot of their figures closing upon the building). It was as if Brooks were torn between being faithful to the source material and lampooning it. Maybe that is why it doesn't quite work. I have to say I really appreciated the scene where, unlike other films on the count, this movie actually shows Dracula visiting Renfield's cell to free him by bending the bars, and the ending provides the vampire with a more productive finish, outlasting his nemesis until his own servant seals his fate.

Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the Children of the Night and the mess they make - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, Dracula Dead and Loving It is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of curtain call at the end that we don't see in movies that often.

The lesson is that horror and comedy are made for each other. I've enjoyed seeing such shows this October, as part of my reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed movies and TV episodes.True, this isn't Mel Brooks' best movie. I know that because I've seen Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs, though not Young Frankenstein. Jokes like having the superstitious villagers and Van Helsing talk funny aren't brilliant and aren't really funny. Nevertheless, I think this Dracula spoof is underrated. We have Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) doing a double take when he sees the Brides of Dracula seducing Renfield; we have Dracula's hypnotism not working the way it's supposed to; and we have Van Helsing not wanting to get his hands dirty, making Harker do the staking. Above all, though, we have Renfield, played by Peter MacNicol who later starred in Ally McBeal. He's at first stupid, then insane, and at any rate he's a colourful character in this version. A highlight of the movie is where Renfield is eating bugs during a nice lunch, trying to be subtle about it but failing. In the end Renfield unintentionally kills Dracula, making him the unexpected hero. However, he still prefers to be a slave, finding a new master. Crazy stuff.Happy Halloween.

Brooks was the producer, director, writer and one of the stars, playing Van Helsing. I'm honestly not much of a fan of Brooks, but I do enjoy Leslie Nielsen, who starred as Count Dracula. Nielsen had made quite a name for himself as a comedian in the previous few years in the Airplane and Naked Gun series. But, to me, Nielsen and Brooks have very different styles, and this was clearly a Mel Brooks movie - heavy on slapstick stuff. What made Nielsen so funny in the aforementioned movies was his absolute deadpan style. That wasn't much in evidence here. This was meant to be slapstick silly. And it was. It wasn't the sort of Nielsen comedy I usually enjoy.In fairness, this movie sticks reasonably close to the basics of the story. In that, it's a reasonably well done horror spoof, and the cast all try. My basic problem with it was that, unlike many, I just didn't find it very funny. There were a few chuckles, but nothing more. Your level of enjoyment of this movie will probably depend, like mine, on whether Brooks or Nielsen are your draw. If you like Brooks, you'll like this. If you're looking for a more typical Nielsen style, you'll find something lacking. Maybe, in fact, you'll find a lot lacking.

There are hits and misses in this film's acting, with Leslie Nielson's iconic and tastefully done comedic brand to Steven Weber's over exaggeration of his prim British accent. Most of the dialog, though, were OK and will give you quite a few chuckles in the movie, which certainly helps a little considering the slowness of the plot's pacing.The Victorian set and atmosphere are nicely done and give the cinematography an eerie feeling of fear and mystery surrounding the vampire and his disastrous deeds. The special effects weren't bad actually, and I especially liked the effect when Nielson's Dracula character turns into a vampire bat.Overall, it's not a entirely bad spoof of the original Dracula.

Half the fun comes from seeing which of the American stars does the worst British accent. Nielsen is good value as always as the Count but the material is hardly up there with the wild and frenetic nature of the AIRPLANE films or indeed his NAKED GUN trilogy.The worst thing about this spoof is how many of the scenes are actually played straight when they could have been much funnier. Certain sequences, like those featuring Nielsen or the bug-eating dinner, are really funny, but many others are too serious. I was actually thinking up jokes that I would have put in as I watched.

Then comes the question. With such a bad overall rating, where are the comments of those who rated it below 5 (there are just a few)? Answer the ones who rate it below 5 find it hard to post a comment because probably they don't like so much to practice the skill known as writing. Or they're illiterates. Or maybe they don't have time for such things. Interesting that the high-raters find that time. Not that i would blame anybody, they might've had their reasons for this status.

If a movie is not so good as some other movies of the same director, that's not a reason to rate it so low, just to punish the lazy director. Some reviewer said it right, even the worst of Mel is the best compared to other craps on the market. And now to what made me write this comment. And the thing that I'm from Transilvania has nothing to do with it. It was a review of a so called film critic. Namely JAMES BERARDINELLI. First let me say he rated it 2 stars out of 4. You can find his review easily on the internet. He states Unless you're a die hard Mel Brooks fan (are there any of them left?), there's no compelling reason to sit through Dracula Dead and Loving It. Mister James, just check out the comments on IMDb, which is the best site of it's kind, before you make such affirmations, and see how many fans are... And maybe you'd stop making such distasteful ironies which just prove your very unprofessional status. Then he goes saying Some of his(Mel's) jokes here have been used before, and, even for the good ones, familiarity mutes laughter... There are so many movie remakes in the history of cinematography which were praised regardless of the fact that were remakes. And this is not even a remake.. And even if some jokes would've been used before, maybe now they're just better used. Did it passed trough your mind? And on top of that i found out he didn't really like to watch movies in his teenage days, maybe 5 A YEAR! I mean, my happiest days were those when i found enough coins in the pockets of my daddy's suits to put together and make enough to buy a ticket to see a movie in the cinema. I think a nowadays person who starts watching movies at 24 years of age must have a serious problem. And after this long hatred or just plain negligence towards this beautiful art of cinematography... this guy writes exactly movie reviews... Surprise! Bad ones! BUT is very famous!! In Wikipedia's page about film critics he appears in the second position in the first category of these critics Notable journalistic critics. Oh, fate, just how cruel your irony can become? Something's very rotten in the old Denmark. So this kind of people makes a movie underrated. Well, we can be glad this beautiful movie hasn't got a 2 or 3 out of 10. Yet... Cause, who knows!

Once the forms are signed Dracula travels to London to take up residence in his new property which is situated next to a mental asylum run by Dr. Jack Seward (Harvey Korman) & as Dracula introduces himself he notices Lucy Westenra (Lysette Anthony) a friend of Seward's daughter Mina (Amy Yasbeck) & takes an unhealthy interest in her as he changes into a bat, flies into her room while she is asleep & drinks her blood. Lucy becomes ill & Seward calls in Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Mel Brooks) an expert on rare diseases who quickly realises that Lucy has been bitten by a Vampire. It's up to Van Helsing to save the day & Seward's daughter Mina who Dracula intends to become his next victim...This American French co-production was co-written, produced, directed & starred Mel Brooks & to be honest it didn't do that much for me. The script by Brooks, Rudy De Luca & Steve Haberman follows Bram Stoker's original novel surprisingly closely & retains most of the relevant action & character's but just spoofs everything up. While the story is solid the decision to turn the film into a silly slapstick comedy first & foremost is one that doesn't work, surely Dracula Dead and Loving It would have worked much better if the filmmakers had worked around the principal that they were making a horror film first as per the original novel & structure the comedy, the gags & the spoof material around it. As it is Dracula Dead and Loving It is a comedy first & horror a very distant second while I think it would have been much better the other way around with it being a horror first & comedy second like The Evil Dead (1982) or Dog Soldiers (2002), I mean you can't really add horror to comedy yet I would say you could add a comedic element to horror. Just a thought. Another big problem with Dracula Dead and Loving It is that it's just not very funny, in fact as to prove my point the best scene is when Harker & Van Helsing stake Lucy through the heart & are covered in gallons of blood, horror first guys, horror first... The only other funny moments in it are two running gags, one about enema's & the other a silly duel between Van Helsing & Dracula about who has to have the last word.Director Brooks uses loads of ancient gags & jokes from silly accents to moronic slapstick like where Dracula rises from his coffin & hits his head on a low hanging chandelier, hey this is classy sophisticated stuff. To it's credit the film looks really good & it has great sets, costumes, special effects & period production design. Apparently the dialogue in Dracula Dead and Loving It spoofs a lot of the dialogue from the original Dracula (1931) with Bela Lugosi, well that's fine if you've seen the original Dracula which I haven't & I'm sure many other people haven't either so I have to ask myself what was the point when there was always going to a large amount of viewers who haven't seen the original Dracula, it seems like a bit of a waste & an in-joke a lot of people weren't going to get. Brooks goes for comedy all the way so forget about any scares.Technically Dracula Dead and Loving It is pretty darn good but this aspect of things only leads to more frustration when one thinks what this film could have been, as someone who has sat through loads of low budget horror I could only think what the likes of Hammer could have done with a budget like this. The acting wasn't anything special & everyone plays it over-the-top, I must say that I personally thought Nielsen was awful as Dracula & had little screen presence.Dracula Dead and Loving It is a comedy that isn't very funny & a horror that has no horror, it fails at everything it tries to do. It's not a totally worthless film as it's quite nice to look at & it has a strong story thanks to the original source but as a whole it didn't work for me.

Indeed, compared with Brooks' masterpiece Blazing Saddles, Brooks' take on the classic Stoker novel isn't audacious. Nevertheless, anybody who has read Stoker's chiller will see how closely Brooks and Transylvania 6-5000 scenarist Rudy De Luca along with Life Stinks scribe Steve Haberman had followed the novel with their reverent adaptation. Occasionally, particularly when his shadow does different things, Dracula Dead and Loving It is reminiscent of Bram Stokers' Dracula with Gary Oldman. Meanwhile, Brooks stakes or perhaps skewers everything in sight. Peter MacNicol is nothing short of brilliant as Renfield, and he rivals Dwight Frye from the Bela Lugosi Dracula, especially Frye's insane laughter. Like the novel, the story unfolds as the solicitor Thomas Renfield travels abroad from London to Transylvania to sell Dracula a house. When they meet each other at Dracula's castle, Renfield gets tangled up in a huge spider web that Dracula walked through without disturbing it. The name of the place is Carfax Abby. Like Dracula, Renfield cuts his finger accidentally, but he bleeds far more that Frye did in the original. Suffice to say, MacNicol's Renfield literally gushes. During the voyage to England, we watch as Dracula's coffin slides back and forth during a tempest. Dracula has a difficult time hypnotizing women. He contends with a female usher at the opera house and later has trouble giving the right directions so that Mina will leave her room and join him outside after dark. Several members of the cast are familiar Brooks' actors, including Harvey Korman and Avery Schreiber. Steven Weber is a hoot as Jonathan Harker. When he drives a stake through Lucy's heart, Van Helsing has judiciously stepped behind a curtain so that he won't be baptized by Lucy's blood. Jonathan emerges as thoroughly drenched. Dracula Dead and Loving It was Mel Brooks' last film to direct, and it is often amusing. Leslie Nielson has a field day as Dracula in this lightweight, inoffensive comedy.

Brooks as the vampire hunter is the only decent supporting role and he counters formula with a superb solution involving mirrors. MacNicol and Yasbeck are total cardboard even after transformation. Steven Weber is plainly not funny and his casting is distracting, and not in a positive way. It is a satire of vampire movies that huge Brooks fans will likely be loving it.

Evidently, Brooks hoped he could work the same magic with the Dracula films, but his Dracula, Dead and Loving It fails to reach the same heights of comedy as his earlier film. Unfortunately, Brooks got off to a bad start by shooting his Dracula homage in color; Young Frankenstein was shot in glorious black and white and evoked the 1930's studio look of the original films. While his Dracula take-off resembles the rich color and production design of the British Hammer horror films, Brooks might have been better to emulate the eerie shadowy atmosphere of the Bela Lugosi classic. Brooks may also have turned to the Francis Ford Coppola Dracula for inspiration, because the Count's hairstyle more than resembles Gary Oldman's in that film.The Brooks film does have some amusing moments, and follows the familiar Dracula storyline from Transylvania to London. While a surprising choice for the role, Leslie Nielsen is always fun to watch as the count, who never drinks...wine; Nielsen is especially funny when he is the talking head on a flying bat. As Renfield, Peter MacNicol does a good Dwight Frye imitation, and his insect snacking is a particular highlight. Mel Brooks himself plays Professor Van Helsing as, well, Mel Brooks, but Harvey Korman is more restrained than usual as Dr Seward, and Steven Weber is no comic. The film desperately needs a Madeline Kahn or a Marty Feldman to spark the lines and soar like a bat. Although failing to produce a second comedy-horror masterpiece, Brooks made a passably entertaining movie. While viewers may not burst into laughter, many will smile from time to time at familiar Brooks routines and generally have a good time.

"},{"Title":"Dracula Dead and Loving It","Date":"6 November 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Another dodgy film title and arguably Mel Brooks last decent spoof after a long career in film led to a brief spell in the theatre as things started to wind down. In fact this was Brooks last major film in which he starred and directed.Now I must admit that when I first saw the film I didn't really like it much, the whole thing looked cheap, tacky and wasn't overly funny. But the strangest thing, like with other Brooks films, I have found myself appreciating it a lot more over the years.Like his other spoofs this has pot shots at various classic vampire films over the years but the main target is of course the Lugosi gem. Its a real blend of styles which kinda works and kinda doesn't. Naturally the film is created with an old time appearance reminiscent of the 1931 film, but at the same time it has those great cheesy cardboard cutout visuals of Hammer horrors. I personally think the film has a lot in common with 'Spaceballs' in the fact that it looks hammy but at the same time it also has some neat effects. The main negative aspect of the film in my opinion was most of the sets are obviously sets which is a bit off putting I can't deny and there is a distinct lack of scenic spooky landscapes or creepy castles which is a real shame. I realise the film is suppose to be low rent as it were but all Dracula flicks need some nice eerie real locations and spooky castles. Despite that there are some nice touches here and there, the low budget bat transformations of Dracula are kinda cute, lots of little homages and visual gags, everything has been over done, forced and blown out of proportions on purpose which is amusing, costumes are suitably stuffy and set the mood well, plus the casting is actually quite good.Now I know you can't expect top rate acting in a Brooks spoof but there are still some nice little performances here. The best for me being MacNicol as the whimpering stir crazy Renfield. The character does get a bit too loony tunes as the film progresses but initially I really like his stiff upper lipped Englishman when he first travels to see Dracula. The best scene must be when Renfield sits down with Dr Seward for tea and ends up eating bugs. Not only that but the pronunciation of raspberries by Harvey korman in this sequence is hilarious.Even though he has top billing the late great Nielsen wasn't the best thing here (the combination of him and Brooks together in films came too late in the day unfortunately). Bottom line Nielsen is miscast as Dracula, he doesn't look the part and he doesn't sound the part, but that's why he is perfect in the role. The fact he's completely wrong for the role makes it work, its just funny that he doesn't come across as a Dracula kind of guy and I think Nielsen knows that and uses it. Whilst watching I can't help but think Leslie is actually trying in certain scenes bless him, he does appear to actually go for it and really put on his best Lugosi/Dracula performance just for the hell of it, he's enjoying his chance in the role. End of the day only Nielsen could get away with this kind of deliberate miscasting, he was (and still is) such a popular lovable guy.Brooks himself enters the fray as Van Helsing and fits the role pretty well with his mock German, Jewish accent. In a sense he's playing the same characters as President Skroob and Frederick Bronski with similar facial hair but not as dumb. Yeah sure we've seen it all before with Brooks but if you're a fan then you won't complain. His best scene must be the stake through the heart sequence, simple but effective.I do get the impression that Brooks is merely working his way through every genre he can and this film simply ticks a box on the list...pretty much like 'Men in Tights'. I also get the feeling he is trying to recapture the same level of success he achieved with 'Young Frankenstein' and the Gothic horror genre. To be brutally honest most of the jokes have been used before in previous works but at least its not as childish as 'Men in Tights' and does offer some adult content. I won't say this parody is a great film, it doesn't really come close to previous Brooks films but its still mildly amusing and a must for fanboys.6/10 "},{"Title":"One the best Dracula movies, hilarious (spoilers)","Date":"3 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  This and Mystery Science 300 the Movie are two of the few movies that never get old ( and I like alot of different movies).

Given the quality of Mel Brooks' cinematic output after the 1980s, I assumed this was going to be terrible, but once I got twenty minutes in, I was surprised at how much I was laughing. This is a solid parody of the cinematic versions of Dracula, spoofing everything from the silent Nosferatu (1922) to the then-recent Ford Coppola version. Of course, most of the humor is derived from the now-campy 1931 classic, but luckily, the jokes are never mean-spirited and it's obvious (as it was in Young Frankenstein) that Brooks and the other cast members have a lot of love for the Universal Horrors of the 30s and 40s while admitting their hokier aspects.Sure, some of the gags are stupid (the enema running gag is the epitome of childish but hilarious humor). And some of the scenes seem to be there only to pad the running time (the first dance scene between Dracula and Mina (the one without the mirror) comes to mind). However, the actors all do amazing jobs, especially Peter MacNicol as Renfield, who does such a spot-on impersonation of Dwight Frye that you cannot help but be impressed. He also steals the show from even Leslie Nielson and Harvey Korman, both funny, funny men.Is it Young Frankenstein (1974)? Not at all, but it's a pleasant spoof with more hits than misses.

Sadly in recent years, Brooks has made the mistake of associating himself with Leslie Nielsen. Whilst Nielsen was brilliant in earlier films, he has slowly got old and pointless in later films. Mixing with Brooks has simply added to this decline. In Dracula Dead And Loving It, we are given a daft story which is occasionally funny, but is often pointless.Spoofing the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), this film follows the script loosely, taking different aspects and hideously satirising them.Perhaps the one key problem with Dracula Dead And Loving It is that it's source for jokes is slightly too limited. With one or two really daft jokes about flying into glass or walking into walls, it produces one or two major jokes. Sadly though, these jokes are only funny for a brief time. Perhaps if Brooks had created a script which was thirty minutes long, the film would be a brilliant comedy which everyone loves and laughs at. Sadly however, by stretching the film out, the story is drawn out to excessive lengths.Dracula Dead And Loving It should have been a good film. It's a typical daft spoof of a horror masterpiece. Ultimately however, the script and the source material are both so limited that there is no way to fully cover the ninety minute length. In effect, this film is a thirty minute sketch stretched out to excessive proportions.

I thought this was going to be as bad as Mr. Magoo. But, it wasn't. It seems Nielsen works better making a spoof not a remake. But, I wouldn't really call this a spoof. It is more a mockery of British accents and serious vampire movies. It takes a montage of scenes and does them in a spoof-like way, but it isn't exactly a full-on spoof. Leslie Nielsen and Peter MacNicol are a pleasure to watch as complete idiots, while the supporting cast take the really funny moments (eg, the stake-through-the-heart and closet gags).

Steve Webber chooses to play it straight the whole time except for when he gets covered in blood from nailing the stake into undead Lucy's heart and Van Helsing (the hilarious Mel Brooks) keeps telling him to nail her again and he eventually, cynically replies She's dead enough. Amy Yasbeck doesn't get to be really funny until she tries to get the very repressed Harker to touch her after her night with Dracula. I love it when Dracula yells at his shadow.She's undead?! - Jon HarkerShe's nosferatu! - Van HelsingShe's Italian?! - Jon Harker "},{"Title":"This movie is very funny","Date":"24 August 2003","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  This is a funny movie.  The subtlety that marks the earlier Brooks masterpieces Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein is non-existent but it's still really funny.  Peter MacNicol is unquestionably the movie's driving force as Renfield.  The paper cut sequence and the coffin sliding sequence are very funny.  The moment where MacNicol screams more effeminately then Lysette Anthony could ever dream of is inspired and the difference is hilarious.  The sequence with Nielsen and the usherette is a great comedy bit with an all-time great reaction by Nielsen.  Leslie Nielsen, the ultimate slapstick champion of the last decade, is an obvious choice to play the ultimate Prince of Darkness.  He's good but not great.  Harvey Korman lends his legendary comedic presence but doesn't have anything to do as dottering old Seward.  Steven Weber was much better in the TV show, Wings, then he is here but his sequence in the coffin where he spikes Lucy is gut busting.  Amy Yasbeck is pretty much the same as she was in Robin Hood Men in Tights.  Lysette Anthony is a natural as Lucy.  Brooks, himself, adds his own brand of lunacy as Van Helsing.  The ballroom sequence is funny and the ending is a bit disappointing.  Dracula Dead and Loving It is far from Young Frankenstein as a work of art but it is very funny nonetheless.

The more sophisticated humor--at least in spots--may reflect a more mature (but just as delightfully silly) Brooks.The fact that Stoker is given writing credit also reflects the fact that the script follows the original book quite closely up to a point (the ball, for those who don't know both the movie and the book).  Brooks catches the sexiness inherent in the book and exaggerates it, but because he follows the tradition of most Dracula movies and also truncates the action of the book in the same way, he leaves out the really high-tech flavor of Stoker's novel.  I wish he had left in the real zinger that made me do a double take when I read the book  Renfield is visited by the spirit of Dracula, who urges him to come to him.  The doctor, who has placed Renfield close to his office in order to monitor him, is dictating notes into an early Edison-type machine when Renfield tells his master I'm coming!  The doctor too says, I'm coming.  Clearly, in the context, the doctor is not talking about locomotion.The blood transfusion to Lucy, the long trip to Europe and Transylvania to catch the fleeing Count by the fastest known means of transportation (the train), the transcription on the train by the once-bitten Mina of the doctor's notes on a portable typewriter (a new-enough-fangled machine as a whole--but a portable!), all this length in the novel is cut to the chase in the usual way.  The film certainly follows Stoker more closely than the original Nosferatu, which couldn't mirror the novel too closely because Stoker's widow was using even the copyright law of those days to quash the film, which she whittled down to 2 copies that escaped to the modern day--not with her permission.  (Stoker was a theater manager in London. When Nosferatu appeared, movies were considered to be competition with theater, and his widow--he died of syphilis when still relatively young--was scandalized that his book should be turned into a movie and not a play.)But the garlic--ah the garlic.  Not a single film has gotten that right. The book makes it clear that they had to send to Holland for garlic *flowers*, yes flowers.  Not garlic bulbs.  That alone is a gag that no one will catch except Stoker readers, another subtlety in this most subtle of Brooks's films.  Last, but certainly not least, the very funny Anne Bancroft appears early onand on and echoing on--who knew, when she played Annie Sullivan, that she would marry a comedian & become one!

The transfer is gorgeous and really does justice to the movie's elaborate art direction which strives (a) to recreate or evoke the look and feel of the 1931 version of 'Dracula' (with passing allusions to the Murnau and Coppola versions) and (b) to simply overpower the viewer with its colourful elegance and Gothic glamour. This is the work of a very funny, very cultured, very observant and very devious brain Mel Brooks. The reason why it is controversial and has so many 'casual detractors' (people who hate it without being able to really tell you why) is that it supposes that the viewer is just as cultured as its maker and that he has seen, appreciated, loved and reflected on every important version of 'Dracula' that was ever made. The Brooks movie itself is closely modeled on the 1931 version which was inspired by a stage play which was already very, very far removed from the original novel. By simply retelling the story contained in this God-awful stage-play very slowly, very solemnly and very respectfully (all the original 'thrills' of the 1931 version are left intact and sometimes amplified), the absurdity of the whole enterprise becomes self-evident and causes one to break up in repeated titters. The various puns, pratfalls and elements of outright parody just add a very flavourful icing to this already powerful basic cake mix. The end-result has the feel of a group of talented adults putting on an amateur recreation of a very bad play for their own amusement and with an unlimited budget. It's just that no one can be expected to keep a straight face throughout such an ordeal! Another part of this movie's charm is that the movie recreation part being so convincing in itself, a horror film aficionado cannot help but be affected by the suspense elements of it and invaded by a perpetual state of nervous excitement that makes him or her break out into nervous laughter at the slightest provocation. And what talented provocateurs we are dealing with here ... I have seen this movie countless times now and I like to put it on for unsuspecting guests who vaguely remember having heard deprecatory statements about it, just to see them change their minds and have a really, really good time.

When a comedic movie falls into the same category, it is almost impossible to make sport of it &#150; because any frivolity in the review may be misconstrued as comedic quality that the MOVIE possesses. So let me clarify from the outset This comedy is not to be laughed at.Who would have thought that Mel Brooks &#150; the genius writer/director behind Blazing Saddles, History Of The World and Young Frankenstein (a successful comedy movie wholly in the vein of this failed one &#150; pun intended) &#150; would be prone to helming a comedy as pitifully appalling as Dracula Dead And Loving It? One imagines that Brooks' comic radar is so finely-attuned that he would have seen through the financial and corporate layers of this film's drudgery and simply either abandoned it and cut his losses when he saw that it was not working, or salvaged the potential high points and let the cutting room floor eat the rest.He did neither, which reveals that something is terribly askew in the Brooks universe. No longer is it good to be the king - Mel Brooks is merely an old man these days, his tastes no longer running congruent with his audience's; his comedy no longer as energetic or as biting as the wit of his youth (which, relatively speaking, was his late-40s anyway).The Brooks gag formulas are definitely still there, but seem lazily inserted as dependable fallback material, rather than inspired stylistic substance. Jokes which I can imagine my 15-year-old self repeating ad nauseam in the schoolyard, now fall flat and wearisome on inured sensibilities.Not only does the film suffer from rehashed and lazy gags, Brooks' direction lacks coherence and is oft-times merely cursory; there are wide shots, reverses and close-ups which serve no purpose, camera blandly flitting from one unnecessary shot to the next, not merely misdirecting our eye, but searching for subject matter to fill the frame judiciously. Many shots seem to be second-unit throwaway footage. Instead of easing back and letting the film's levity wash over me, as should have been the case, all these logistical details kept bugging my senses, detracting from the already-sparse humor.During the cast-and-crew screening for this film, one has to wonder whether there were any genuine laughs or whether the aura of the director's past glories tainted the crew into believing that they had a good comedy on their hands, thereby eliciting perfunctory giggles out of respect for their elders.In this film's adherence to the original Dracula story and noticeable neglect of comedic opportunities, not only did it fail as a good comedy, it becomes barely convincing as an A-List movie. Brooks did not need to re-make Dracula. Yet this seems to be all he did &#150; in a manner inferior to that of droves of dramatic film-makers before him. Mel's strong suit is COMEDY. So why were we subjected to a film about the infamous psychotic blood-drinker, so loosely sprinkled with jokes that they seem incongruous within the context of the morbid tale? Where you would expect punchlines, there are scene-fades; where you would expect a gag, there is exposition of the Dracula legend; where you would expect laugh-out-loud-slapstick, there are strained attempts at re-capturing youthful insouciance from laurels past. And the dance sequence between Dracula and Mina was needless padding. (Makes you wonder what DID make the cutting room floor.) The actors vacillate between parodying Victorian characters and actually *playing* them. Harvey Korman's Dr. Seward can almost be an actual over-actor from one of the REAL Dracula movies, whilst Steven Weber's Jonathan Harker frequently comes across as an exaggerated English nobleman from a Christopher Lee film. Peter MacNichol, though, makes the perfect Renfield &#150; for ANY Dracula film, serious or spoof - and is the only actor who truly nails his role in this blunt-toothed parody. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony are just too damn hot to be funny all the self-deprecating melodrama in the world is not gonna help, chickie-babes - LOOK AT THOSE RACKS! On paper, Leslie Neilsen's Dracula seemed like a hilarious coup, as did Mel Brooks' Dr. van Helsing, but both seemed to be laboring under the specter of their own reputations as funnymen. Neilsen playing STRAIGHT and being oblivious to his own humor is how he works best, but here he actively went for laughs, which means that even Brooks, as director, did not discern Neilsen's forte - or *did* discern it and chose to make Neilsen play against type anyway &#150; either way, an erroneous decision. And Brooks' van Helsing seemed too self-aware of every mispronunciation he made - for the sake of schoolyard quotes - to be regarded as genuinely hilarious.If Mel Brooks has grown so blind that he cannot see that the comedy boat has left him onshore; if he has become so oblivious to discernment that he actually thinks this film is noteworthy enough to be considered a vital comedy, the movie's subtitle may well be applied to HIM &#150; Dead &#150; And Loving It.(Movie Maniacs, visit www.thedunmore.com/POFFY-MovieReviews.html) "},{"Title":"Not perfect, but entertaining","Date":"8 February 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Let me introduce you to the humor associated with Dracula Dead and Loving it! A doctor gives a class of medical students a lecture while he cuts open a body and takes various organs out. One by one the students faint, until there is one left standing, unharmed by the gore. The doctor, frustrated, removes the dead victim's large intestine and hands it to the student, who faints immediately.The doctor is Mel Brooks, who walks happily over to his assistant and makes a remark about how many students he has caused to faint during his lecture seminars.Here lies the roots of Mel Brook's latest spoof Dracula Dead and Loving it. With Brooks' latest films flopping severely, it seems the famed comedian has turned back to his old days in Young Frankenstein-type-satires of the ancient horror genre. The Universal Pictures Horror Films genre.I suppose he figured this would be his big break back onto the big screen. Perhaps he thought returning to what was once a hit would re-invent himself as a filmmaker, screenwriter and actor. But it didn't work quite as well as he figured. Why? Well, the film is quite amusing, but like many of his other films of such, it just isn't particularly great. There are a lot of laughs, but many of them half-hearted giggles compared to the boistrous laughter that ensued while watching Young Frankenstein. Here we don't even get as many laughs as we did in Spaceballs, which was a good. if not great comedy that had some great gags in various places. But the deal with Dracula... is that instead of great gags in various places, it has good gags in prolonged areas.I won't go into the plot much, because it is basically exactly the same as the Universal Classic by the semi-same name. The only difference is that this film is played for laughs, the other wasn't.Mel Brooks takes every scene from Dracula and re-films it with comedic actors, including Peter MacNicol, himself (Mel Brooks), and Leslie Nielsen as the feared Count Dracula.If you have seen Kung Pow Enter the Fist, you will probably remember that director/writer/actor Steve Oederkerk filled himself into various kung-fu films and dubbed over the other actors' voices. Dracula... is a bit like Kung Pow, only instead of digitally inserting Nielsen and co. into the Universal classic (which could have been a more clever choice), Brooks re-films the entire movie with a comedy script instead of a serious script.But too many gags are wasted to truly name this film classic comedy. It's the perfect treat for a Friday or Saturday night in, and I've watched it at least four times on TV on various nights, but I would not recommend you run out and rent the film.Like I said before, the problem with Dracula Dead and Loving it! is that instead of great gags in various places, it has good gags in prolonged areas.

Leslie Nielsen is our blood sucking main man and he dons his best Bela Lugosi cape and accent to boot to create a, memorable performance. Brooks uses his comedic interests well in picking the theme but not in styling the substance, and although I feel many hate this more than I do, I still thought it was pretty bad too. Now don't expect massively over the top jokes, you know the kind where Dracula turns into a bat and hits a window(although that does happen). Brooks seems to create humour which looks promising, but then waters it down for some reason, so that it doesn't fit. Now I'm not saying this isn't funny at it's certain moments, I even dare say I slightly enjoyed this movie(to say it is very poor), the movie has it's laughs and some well timed jokes not to mention crazy characters too.You might think I'd say the funny guy is Nielsen here but in truth my praise if you can call it that is all to Peter MacNicol who as Renfield is hilarious, the top person and thing about this movie. I'm not kidding when I say that Renfield is probably the reason this movie is a whole rating higher, I mean he also works well with Nielsen, the jokes run well between them and even those who are hard pressed to laugh will still I feel laugh maybe a little at MacNicol.Having said all that previously, I do however find this lazy writing and although I felt Brooks directs OK, his skill with the words is not his strongest suit in this case. In the case of the sets, you will only find horrible Hollywood staging that OK OK maybe has something to do with the comedy of It all, still didn't make me laugh. There's actually very little to say about this, in fact I think anyone who can write an essay about this is a hero, it has so little depth to it just becomes another silly joke to be tossed under the pile of films you will only watch once. Now who could I recommend this too?, ah yes those who like silly humour of course. Now Nielsen fans I hate to say that this isn't a patch on Naked Gun or Airplane but you do see some jokes along those kind of slapstick type humour lines. I think it is funny as mentioned, for me it starts to get more funny a little too late but nevertheless is still lazy work and probably too silly most of the time to create a reasonable film.Overall a Mel Brooks comedy that fails to shine, you know the type of movie that never delivers on it's promise of being hilarious, but can have it's moments in the spotlight. Watch out for Renshaw played by Peter MacNicol and a certain scenes with bugs is for me the top scene of this entire thing, in fact you could just cut all the parts out that make you laugh and that would be the best way to watch this movie.

It was certainly a wise move to use subject matter famous the world over and simply begging for parody after the hugely pretentious  Bram Stoker's Dracula. So how did he cock it right up? Like all Mel Brooks failures it starts with the script. Mel and co. didn't even try this time. Whole stretches of the film take place without even an attempt at comedy. There are some dim in-jokes for those only familiar with previous Dracula movies and then there are the very, very rare moments when someone says or does something that looks almost like it was intended to be funny. Out of this barren waste land of a comedy there are some gags that do amuse. Hardly a great selling point though is it? Come see Dracula Dead And Loving It and very nearly crack a smile once or twice! It's difficult to be objective about a film made by the man who was once king of parody. However, taken on its own terms, without any knowledge of the director's awesomely surperior previous movies this movie would still tank big time.Leslie Nielson gave a brilliantly dead-pan performance in Airplane! and the Naked Gun trilogy. He had become famous for his association with movies that specialised in zany spoofs. I can understand, then, why an Executive Producer with no artistic sense would think casting Mr. Nielson as the lead in a Mel Brooks movie would be perfect. Mel should have known better. Nielson can do goofy pratfalls wonderfully as a Detective because he looks the part. But when it's Dracula ... This is how I see it. The art of spoof is to undermine the serious elements of the subject matter you are mocking. For that to work everyone you see in the cast must look like they have walked off the set of a serious movie. If you were making a serious adaptation of Dracula, would you ever think of casting Leslie Nielson? For the pratfalls to work, the film must LOOK genuine for the comedy. Casting someone who could be cast for real as Dracula who then slips on bat s*** and falls down the stairs would be funny!Didn't mean to moan for as long as that.

Often with his movies, it seems that he can do better; but he continually falls into the childish humour trap, and it spoils everything. Take this movie for example; a spoof of Dracula. Bram Stoker's classic story is ripe for having fun made of it, and while Brooks does implement some scenes that are very funny; much of it is squandered by childishness, and not the good kind. I'm not saying that I'm 'too grown up' for this sort of film, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's just not funny. Adding to that is the fact that even the moments in the film that ARE funny are squandered by the rubbish humour surrounding them. To Brooks' credit, he has moulded the story well around his jokes. He's changed certain elements, but never enough to veer it completely away from the original material. The plot will be familiar to anyone who wasn't born five minutes ago, and follows Bram Stoker's classic Dracula story. Of course, it follows it with a load of gags...but the central plots are still there.Leslie Nielson isn't the actor that you would immediately connect with the Dracula role, but he is the one that usually stars in spoofs; and he does do quite well with the material. Thinking about it, Leslie Nielson isn't a million miles away from the character. Bela Lugosi, the best man to ever play Dracula, is a camp actor and Nielson's mannerisms, while over the top and silly, are a bit like Lugosi's. Mel Brooks stars alongside Nielson as the vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing. His performance is as you would expect it to be, but he does hold the audience's attention rather well and I would say he did a pretty good job. As mentioned, and as usual for Brooks films; for every gag that works, there's four that don't - but I guarantee that even the most hardened Brooks hater will laugh a couple of times during this film. One scene that sees Dracula using mind control on two women springs to mind for being amusing. On the whole; this certainly isn't a must-see, and I don't doubt that I'll forget I ever saw it soon enough - but it's not Brooks' worst effort.

In the film Nelson plays Count Dracula who comes to town seeking new victims but Van Helsing (Brooks) is on hand to try and destroy him. Those walking into this expecting YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN type of laughs are certainly going to be disappointing because even the unfunniest moments of that film are still much better than the best parts of this. It's really shocking to see how many of the laughs fall flat on their face because there's no doubt that everyone involved was putting up an effort to try and get something funny on screen. I think the biggest problem is that time simply snuck up on Brooks to where his brand of humor just wasn't good enough anymore. I mean, films like THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE pretty much changed comedy and I guess it should come as no shock that Brooks' films started to suffer around this point. This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The humor from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy. "},{"Title":"Mel Brooks forgot what was funny","Date":"25 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" In his last few directorial efforts Mel Brooks truly forgot what funny was. He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula Dead and Loving It is his last film.This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks.I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

I saw this years a go on VHS and enjoyed it then, so i decided to pick up the DVD, and i'm glad i did, because it's a pretty funny film, with great characters and performances. Most of the critics panned this, however i don't see why, sure it has quite a few jokes that are unfunny, however there plenty of laughs to be had, and it's an enjoyable viewing any time. It had some great lines (Master Master, I mean Mister Mister!), and it was fun to watch Leslie steal Lugosi's accent. This is a funny film, that i highly recommend you give it a watch, buy it if you get it cheap. The Direction is good. Mel Brooks does a good job here adding lots of slapstick humor good camera work, and he kept the film funny for the most part throughout. there is a tiny bit of blood. we get a bloody paper cut, and, a impaling with a stake(extremely bloody, but it's all comical). The Acting is excellent!.Leslie Nielsen is AMAZING as always and was hilarious here, i loved the Bela like accent, and he was a lot of fun to watch! (Leslie rules!). Peter MacNicol is extremely hilarious here, i absolutely love this guy, he is one funny guy, and he was fantastic here as Renfield, and has some of the funniest lines. Steven Weber was okay but got on my nerves, and his chemistry with Amy Yasbeck was off. Amy Yasbeck is gorgeous, and does fine with what she has to do.Mel Brooks is very funny as Van Helsing i liked him. Lysette Anthony is okay and nothing more.

In the 1930s version, Lugosi serves some drugged wine to Renfield. Renfield Aren't you having any? Dracula I never drink -- wine. I doubt that the people involved in the production intended the line to be a joke, but that's what it's become. In Mel Brooks' version, the line is repeated and the camera holds on Leslie Nielson's face, waiting for the laughs to die down.A second problem is that the gags vary from funny to silly, as is usual with Brooks, but there aren't enough of either kind. We seem to follow the 1930s version fairly closely, almost as if it were to be taken seriously. And the jokes that pad out the scenes simply aren't that amusing. In one conversation (in ancient Moldavian) both Nielson and Brooks try to get the last word in. It drags on. And in the last scene of the movie, Brooks is alone with the coffin containing the now thoroughly cremated Nielson. He glances around, slyly opens the coffin an inch, and shouts in the last word of the ancient Moldavian conversation they'd had half an hour earlier, then slams the coffin shut and strides out with a look of satisfaction. If that's the best that could be done for a climactic gag, well, there's a problem.There are other problems. Brooks is okay in the part of Van Helsin, but Leslie Nielson is a bit old for the part of Dracula, and he doesn't have the accent. (It ought to be overblown in a movie like this.) See George Hamilton do a better job with better lines in HIS Dracula parody, Love At First Bite.It's not a total waste and there are some funny moments. It's just that there aren't enough of them.

What the hell was that crap with the inspector going yes, no, yes, no? That should not make your final draft. Men In Tights wasn't great but it had so many jokes some of them, inevitably, were funny. This is really embarrassing, I don't know if it's the subject matter or a strict deadline or whatever, but Brooks should have just left this screenplay somewhere up his attic, so it could be forgotten.

A fan of Brooks and Leslie Nielson may or may not find much use here. The gags, jokes, puns, physicalities and outright spoofed diddies are at the usual at-least-a-minute rate of the past Brooks comedies, but there are just more misses than hits. The bright spots come in very intermittent spurts from star Nielson, who may have just burnt out his comedic energy on the Naked Gun trilogy, and from Peter MacNicol, who does give one very funny scene involving a fly (in general this and Ghostbusters 2 are his career highlights). But people who could be doing a lot better like Harvey Korman in the film don't at all. The style of the film is also a little sluggish compared to the director's past works, and when one of the misses comes, you can feel the dud hit (i.e. I think I just had a day-mare, as Dracula wakes up). Not that in some spots one might neglect to grin or have a chuckle- and the nailing of the body in the coffin is a big comic set up and pay-off. But the times when the jokes miss, even as a kid (and being more susceptible to the slapstick and satire comedy of Brooks on one level) the overall effort is a mindboggler. One can only hope that Brooks will come back and write/produce/direct one last swan-song, aside from the Broadway convergence of the past several years (and the Producers musical-movie is something else entirely).

But then again, this was written and directed by Mel Brooks, who usually makes me laugh quite a lot. But somehow, he just doesn't cut it this time. I'm not sure where exactly he went wrong, but the worst decision he made on this film was to make it a spoof film Zucker brothers style, meaning poorly done gags and jokes that rely on childish humor, horrid over-acting and repeated jokes all over the place. The plot is decent enough. The acting is satisfactory, except for the parts that are hideously overacted. The humor is puerile, and most, if not all, of the gags and jokes are based on sex or stupidity. Very Zucker. At least there were hardly any 'bodily functions' based gags, or I wouldn't have watched this whole film. I don't think I laughed more than once during this film, which is an all-time low for a Mel Brooks flick. One particular scene had Dracula hypnotizing two people into doing different things at the same time, leading to them doing what the other was supposed to be doing, which made me laugh a good deal. Other than that, though, there were no real laughs, no, not even a chuckle every now and then. Brooks reuses several cast-members from earlier films(mainly Robin Hood Men in Tights), among others Amy Yasbeck, Mark Blankfield and Megan Cavanagh.

Dracula turns him into his servant, and they go to London, England, where the dark lord wants to devour all the blood from (rich) English women he can. After an attack on Lucy Westenra (Lysette Anthony), Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Brooks) is brought in to try and help solve the mystery of the strange markings on her neck, and he is sure it is a vampire attack.

Obviously they do find out Dracula is the vampire, and that Renfield is his servant, and they are now all brought together in the final showdown. The fact that Brooks fails to create the same quality of horror spoofing he did with Young Frankenstein, is a little embarrassing. Nielsen may have the accent, but no real presence, MacNicol may have a better English accent than Keanu Reeves did, but he is still an idiotic character, and as for the jokes, only the ones involving blood going everywhere gets the tiniest giggle from me, the rest are cheap and boring.
