His great supporting actor was the veteran actor, Geoffry Lewis, (Frank Avery),Mind Games,'03, whose main goal was  to protect the twin boys who were almost killed as infants and see that they obtained the wealth that belonged to the both of them.  The gals in the picture add some hot steamy scenes, especially in the Boiler Room!

Van Damme hasn't been making much great movies recently. I remember in my school days, Van Damme was one of the favourites among the lads. Van Damme has given us Great movies in the past. Kickboxer, Bloodsport and Hard Target are some of His Finest Movies. I'm my opinion, Double Impact is better then the mentioned movies in terms of Storyline. Double Impact has great fight scenes including Van Damme against Bolo Yeung, also in Bloodsport. It has Plenty of violence, packed with good laughs. This was Van Dammes opportunity to act apart from fighting all the time. Van Damme does a decent job playing two separate characters Alex and Chad. It has a impressive storyline about 2 twin brothers separated at birth, who link up when their older, to take revenge on the Gang that killed their parents. This is a great entertaining movie.

Revenge is on the cards again, playing both twin brothers separated at birth and reunited 25 years later (one's a US aerobics instructor who wears the silk underwear, the other a tough cigar-chomping gangster-type raised in the Hong Kong). Their parents, you see, were hopelessly slaughtered when they were babies, and summarily they vow vengeance.

This is classic Van Damme at his absolute best. In yet another (well in fact the first) of his duel role films, Jean Claude plays two twins separated at birth. They were separated when both their parents were killed by vicious gangsters, including the legend Bolo Yeung (Enter the Dragon).What makes this film is the always-enjoyable combination of Van Damme and director Sheldon Lettich. Lettich knows how to get the best out of Claude in the fights sequences, with a liberal and entertainingly cheesy use of slo-mo while Van Damme grunts and poses and jumps kicks his way through countless foes. The fights are so entertaining, and they more than make up for the wooden or ham-fisted acting of the cast, not to mention the brainless plot and cheesy dialogue. This was written by Van Damme and really seems at times like an ego trip, with some of the lines and actions that characters have. It is entertaining in that sense. What is also funny about this film is the constant posing and muscle flexing from Van Damme. This is one of his most enjoyable films, because it is so fun, it brings back the fun feeling from his earlier film Kickboxer.Overall this is one to watch and the fight between Van Damme and Bolo is the stuff of legend.  ***  "},{"Title":"Little support, but fun to watch","Date":"27 March 2007","Score":"11 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime","Review":" OK, face it, Jean-Claude cannot act his way out of a wet paper bag.

But a decent time-waster at best and for the price of one we would get two Van Damme's on screen. Twins unknowingly separated, to only meet up again 25 years later. Nice. Where else could we see Van Damme beating himself up, feuding over things and eventually teaming up to kick-ass. And there's a lot ass kicking, as well gun blazing to go with the martial arts. That's John Woo style. Slow motion galore. Bullets. Blood. Bodies piling up. Add plenty of broken bones. And nose bleeds. The action is brutal and high-energy. Van Damme cops a real work out. Where he has a whole bunch of villains (a gleeful Alan Scarfe and spiteful Phillip Chan), their henchman and Triad gangs to get through. He goes up against an old foe; Bolo Yeung (of Bloodsport fame) and female athlete / body builder Corinna Everson whose choice of fashion is almost upstaged by Van Damme himself. Then we got a bodyguard who uses the spurs on his boot to inflict pain. While stuck in the middle of the two Van Dammes is the always enjoyable character actor Geoffrey Lewis and the ravishing blonde Alonna Shaw. The simple plot (which was co-written by Van Damme) is clean-cut by setting up the motivation at the beginning and then the twins unite to seek vengeance on those involved in the murder of their parents. Also for laughs there's numerous mistaken identity scenarios, Van Damme's colourful fashion sense (the lover-boy one) and the macho script likes to have people telling others to virtually get f**k. Set in Hong Kong, director Sheldon Lettich (who directed Van Damme a year earlier in Lionheart) strikes up some local flavour, amazingly tough action bursts and all at a reliable pace. Bold, but standard Jean-Claude Van Damme 90s action vehicle.When you find them. Bring back their bodies.

In the first of Van Damme's trilogy of twin movies (at least until he decides to use the idea yet again), our boy Jean-Claude plays brothers who are separated when a Triad hit team takes out their parents. Twenty years later, the bad brother is a smuggler in HK, while the good one is an aerobics instructor in Los Angeles, and they team up to take revenge on the boss (Philip Chan) who took out their parents.There's nothing really great about Double Impact, other than the immortal tagline of double the Van Damme, double the Van Damage, but it is a solid low-budget actioner. The script and acting are average to say the least, and the movie looks like it was made for fifty cents and a case of returnable bottles, but when it comes to action, Double Impact delivers the goods. The fights are among some of Van Damme's best, with good choreography and tight filming and editing. Also of note are the gunfights; I might be wrong, but I believe that this was the first Western movie to have John Woo-style dual 9mms (complete with slow motion). If you have a high tolerance for cheeseball antics (or just like to make fun of them), there's some good times to be had with Double Impact. I'm kind of sorry to say this, but given the current anemic state of action films, even middling stuff like this is much better than the crap that has been getting cranked out lately.

Van Damme plays twin boys, who were orphaned in the 1960s by thugs representing some greedy white collar criminals. One of them, Chad, ended up in L. A. where he got to live a fairly soft life. Alex, on the other hand, remained in Hong Kong where he became a street smart smuggler. 25 years later, their uncle Frank (Geoffrey Lewis) locates Alex and reunites the boys so they can have a classic bit of revenge - and reclaim what's theirs in the bargain.All of the action is watchable if never truly inspired. There's a good deal of hard hitting violence (the naive Chad takes his lumps before the story is over), and plenty of effective squib action - not to mention a hearty helping of explosions. The exotic Hong Kong setting certainly helps a lot, as well. One sequence is particularly striking, and you can see bits of that in the trailer. And there's a fairly satisfying confrontation between Van Damme and martial arts icon Bolo Yeung, who plays Moon, a goon who ends up with a fake eye and a nasty scar due to Franks' intervention back in the 60s.There's a certain degree of entertainment in watching Van Damme play two distinctly different characters. Thanks to some reasonably effective movie trickery - body doubles, special effects, and the like - we get to see the twins interacting regularly. Philip Chan, as crime kingpin Raymond Zhang, and Alan Scarfe, as the nefarious Nigel Griffith, are decent action movie baddies in the classic tradition. Both the blonde Alonna Shaw (as Alex's girlfriend Danielle) and the athletic brunette Corinna Everson (as henchwoman Kara) add much sex appeal. The eternally solid and reliable Lewis is a tremendous asset to the story, lending it an appropriate amount of respectability.Double Impact may not be memorable in the end, but it sure provides a nice diversion for the better part of two hours.Seven out of 10.

It contains action, humor, and great martial arts. This movie came out when I was in eighth grade, and it definitely brings good memories. Every one was talking about it when it came out. It begins when a British businessman and his wife are murdered by the mafia; the two twins are rescued by Frank Avery (played by Geoffrey Lewis) who was the family's bodyguard. Then the twins get separated, one is taken by Frank, the other ends up in an orphanage. 25 years later Frank decided to tell Chad (played by Van Damme) all about his parent's death, and that he must go back to Hong Kong to find the killers. Chad meets with his twin brother Alex (played also by Van Damme). One of the things that I love about this movie is that Chad and Alex have totally different personalities; Chad is more like a fly boy, and Alex is a street smart smuggler. The twins are always having disagreements, and there's even a fight scene between Chad and Alex, it was great. Also Bolo Yeung who's one of the villains of the movie, he incarnates, Moon the right hand of Nigel Griffith played by Alan Scarfe. The film is very entertaining, packed with great martial arts action. So on a weekend, buy a pizza, some beers, and invite some of your old high school friends, and enjoy this movie.

Alex is raised in a local orphanage by French nuns while Chad is taken abroad by loyal friend of the family Frank Avery (Geoffrey Lewis). 25 years later, Frank&#x97;now the owner of an LA dojo where Chad is an instructor (and where pastel coloured gis are mandatory!)&#x97;tracks down Alex, reunites the brothers in Hong Kong and helps them to avenge the murder of their parents.Some might argue that Jean Claude Van Damme struggles to play one character convincingly, and that having him play two is not exactly the greatest idea in the world. Those people are wrong. Double the 'Muscles from Brussels' kicking ass, including his own, is actually one of the greatest things to happen in a 90s action movie. That's double the explosive action, double the corny one-liners, double the gun-play (with double the ammo), double the fight scenes and, ultimately, double the fun.Despite its silly set-up, Double Impact is a genuinely tough film, with very little comedy ala Jackie Chan's Twin Dragons; the colourful Hong Kong location not only allows for plenty of authentic flavour, but also enables the use of local stunt-men for whom a hard whack in the head is all part of a day's work. The action comes thick and fast, feet and fists regularly meeting face, making for some really convincing karate smack-downs. On top of all the martial arts mayhem, viewers are also treated to lots of brutal ballistic action, each bullet hit resulting in a delightfully bloody squib eruption.Star Van Damme might not be the greatest thespian to ever grace the silver screen, but he does surprisingly well in his dual roles, convincingly creating two distinctly different characters; he is aided in his task by some well executed special effects and the careful use of body doubles. The rest of the main cast are also very impressive Lewis is as marvellous as always (the guy is a legend in my eyes just for giving the world Juliette), busty blonde Alonna Shaw gives the film sex appeal as Alex's plucky girlfriend Danielle, Chan and Scarfe ooze malevolence, and Bolo Yeung and female bodybuilder Cory Everson make for superb hench-people (does anyone play an utterly ruthless killing machine as convincingly as Bolo?).

But the crooked brother, who had so much promise as a rogue maverick in the beginning, becomes but a jealous whiner as his put-upon lady starts preferring Abel to Cain.It's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and there's an abundance of insert/close-ups that lead one to believe the budget wasn't too high. But the characters are interesting enough to care about and it's the fights that matter, occurring enough to appease hardcore karate buffs.For More Reviews www.cultfilmfreaks.com "},{"Title":"Probably one of the better movies (of the five total) where Van Damme plays two roles!","Date":"19 October 2011","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime","Review":" Alex (Van Damme) and Chad (Van Damme) are twins who were separated at six months old when their parents were murdered by gangsters. Alex became a ne'er-do-well in Hong Kong while Chad became a pretty-boy aerobics instructor in L.A. Convinced to go to Hong Kong to find out the truth, Chad meets Alex, and Yin meets Yang. The two men, despite being brothers, couldn't be more different, and conflicts ensue. But it's all in the name of getting revenge for their slain parents. But it's going to take double the power to take down evildoer Moon (Yeung). Will you feel the impact? Probably one of the better movies (of the five total) where Van Damme plays two roles, Double Impact has JCVD as the happy-go-lucky Chad, with his absurd pastel outfits and tiny pink shorts, as well as the gruff, cigar-chomping Alex. If you've ever seen The Patty Duke show in reruns, you know the show the back of the other character's head style of portraying the two men. The movie wastes little time in having Van Damme do one of his trademark splits (while wearing a leotard, naturally). Chad is the fish out of water in Hong Kong (and the movie sports some great Hong Kong locations and photography), just one side of the coin that is Jean-Claude Van Damme.This is also one of the many team-ups of Van Damme and director Sheldon Lettich. But at almost two hours, the movie overstays its welcome and is just too long. You know what they always say - double the Van Damme, double the running time. Though the movie drags at times, it also has just enough cool moments to make this a roller-coaster of peaks and valleys.The rest of the cast is worthy too, as Bolo is here looking great, Cory Everson plays the bodybuilder who is also in the hard-to-find Ballistic (1995), and Alonna Shaw plays the eye candy - at one point the movie basically stops so it can become like a Playboy video for her. The movie naturally concludes in the time-honored steam factory, and characters even throw barrels at each other, a la Double Dragon. Double Dragon - Double Impact... coincidence? I think not...! After the extensive running time, there is a freeze frame and the C + C Music Factory-like song, Feel The Impact, by Gen plays. By our estimation, Double Impact is kind of hit-or-miss. It's a decent enough idea, but not enough to support such a lengthy movie.For more insanity, please visit comeuppancereviews.com "},{"Title":"Double the Impact","Date":"13 October 2011","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime","Review":" Double Impact hits the the spot for those who enjoy action, violence, and Bolo Yeung.

Not only for his amazing fight scenes, but also for his acting ability along side himself. Not writing here as biased fan, but seeing this film, I shockingly had to admit that Van Damme was far better actor then what people gave him credit for. Story of the film is very cliché of most 90's films. twins get separated at birth and one becomes a criminal while the other one becomes a goody boy. They both have to team up together to protect their family money and name. Which one or both didn't really care for before.Acting in the film, was fairly good, with few exceptions. But people going to see this film, knew that this wasn't going to be the competition for Dances with a wolf or Jeremy Irons performance in Reversal of Fortune. The expectations was that this was going to be enjoyable film with tons of action and the possibility of having Van Damme fight Van Damme in an amazing fight scene. Which the film succeeded in. Van Damme was very clear as two different brothers, who are completely different in all traits. Van Damme managed to create and contain certain ticks, tricks and mannerisms for each one, clear sign of a good actor. Not to mention all of the really cool fight scenes we got to see was a benefit too!!so if you are bored at home and have nothing to do, feel free to give this film a go, if you like 80's and 90's action type of movies, you will love this.

Double Impact is one of my most favorite Van Damme flicks not only because he plays twin brothers in the film but because there's plenty of action to look for. Most movies that were made with an actor playing twins it would usually be a disappointment since they could never get the other person to like the same actor.....O.K.

One child is rescued by their nanny, the other by the family's bodyguard Frank Avery. Alex grows up rough in the orphanage where his nanny leaves him and becomes a criminal in the underworld, while Chad becomes a ladies' man and karate teacher under the guidance of Frank. After several decades, Frank finds Alex and reunites the two brothers in time to battle the same triads who are still in business.The plot to this film opens with such violence in front of children that it alters the paths their lives were going to take. Surely this film shows the effects that young children witnessing violence can have &#150; in this case the children are so badly affected that they both grow up to become Jean-Claude Van Damme! Aside from this terrible event, they come together decades later just as those that murdered their parents are doing a big deal. Of course the whole plot is silly and the whole idea behind the plot is to present two Van Damme's as some sort of major selling point &#150; and I suppose for some it is. Ignoring a silly and rather irritating plot, this film does have plenty of trademark action from it's star(s?) and it is just about enjoyable on that level, even if there are plenty of better action films available to watch on a Saturday night in with beer!Attempts to inject drama into the film with sibling conflict and love interests are wasted and just further bog down an already limp script. Of course part of the blame for the lack of dramatic involvement must lie with Van Damme, who's delivery is as reliable as ever &#150; and this is not a compliment. His characters are given very different hairstyle because we can't rely on Van Damme's performance to be able to tell them apart. However I will be fair to him and say that he has moves and delivers two very enjoyable scenes towards the end (one in shadows, the other with a drum). Shaw makes for an annoying love interest &#150; in the time honoured manner all she does is scream. Lewis is a well known face but cannot life this to be anything more than it is. Van Damme's performance is dwarfed by a laughably bad turn from Alan Scarfe as the main villain &#150; so hammy it should have been between bread.Overall this is not a very good film but, did you expect it to be? I came to expecting people to be kicked in the head and for the star to do the splits and talk with an accent and that's what I got. There are better films out there and it is far too basic to be really enjoyable but it has some good fights and exciting action albeit not enough to support the whole film. Worth seeing if you're just looking for an undemanding action movie to fill an hour or two.

In addition, if you're not able to take a double slam-bang action packed martial arts Van Damme film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better offDouble Impact (1991) was my favorite childhood Van Damme movie, beside Bloodsport was this movie my favorite. I grew up with this film and after re watching this flick, it is not one of my favorite movies anymore but I still like it and I love this movie to death! There are mixed feelings by me for this movie. Bolo Yeung was also in this movie as Moon, Zhang's killer. The fight at the end between Van Damme and Bolo Yeung was the best just like was in Bloodsport. The story was adrenaline action packed and Van Damme played double role in here and he did an excellent job as Alex and Chad two different characters. I always loved this movie and I love the action and the fight choreographer from Jean-Claude Van Damme, I like his spin kick and his martial arts in this movie. Van Damme fights the same guy from Bloodsport. I love this movie a lot, it is bloody full action packed fire guns.What I love in this movie is a great supporting cast, Geoffrey Lewis was a great support cast as Uncle Frank who raised Chad. Alonna Shaw as Danielle Wilde was a great as Alex girlfriend. Their was one imaginary sexy scene that really did not mean anything. Corinna Everson as Kara as Griffith's bodyguard was terrific, here we first time see a women who is a villain in a action movie. In the 90's I don't remember seeing any women been a villain. Corinna was a perfect choice for playing Kara. Philip Chan as Raymond Zhang was awesome he was even in John Woo's Hard Boiled and Bloodsport. The movie it self reflects more on Van Damme's life Chad was really Van Damme, he was raised in Belgium in this film his character was raised in Paris, but with Frank they moved to America. Now after 25.years they come back to Hong Kong in which they track down Alex, together they avenge their parents death. Alex is a bad ass in this movie. He looks so scary, that even I wouldn't dare to cross his path. I love Van Damme in two roles he is great. I have enjoyed this movie a lot and had a lot of fun.Double Impact is a 1991 action film that focuses on a pair of twins who are raised in separate countries and environments after their parents are killed in an ambush. Reunited in Hong Kong, the twins join forces to take down the man responsible for their parents' deaths and stealing their rightful inheritance. Jean-Claude Van Damme portrays both Chad, a French-raised karate instructor fond of short-shorts and the color pink, and Alex, a low level crook raised in Hong Kong and fond of cigars and leather jackets.That is the basic plot about this movie. The contrast between the two characters of Chad and Alex is amazing. The happy go lucky playboy and the brooding street fighting bad ass. You really do get the feeling that there's two Van Dammes in the world and they're right there on screen together. And Chad is one my favorite JCVD characters he's ever played. I love the action sequences, the gun play, the fights and the story that works. In my opinion this movie is very underrated. It was my childhood favorite movie and it always will be.The main problem with the film that I do have is two things One the spin kicks Van Damme (Chad) uses on Bolo Yeung (Moon) was already the same spin kicks in his face in Bloodsport, just in the first movie he used to spin kicks four time. Two This film copied scenes from Lethal Weapon 2 (1989). What I mean by that when Van Damme uses, the Beretta in slow motion, similar scene reminds on Riggs when he shoots with Berreta on Helicopter killing an attacker, the gun play reminds me on Riggs. The Heckler & Koch MP5A3 that Van Damme used, Riggs (Mel Gibson) used the same gun and killed the attackers on his trailer when Riggs was staying on a roof. The final fights and shoot outs in the harbor and on a ship was ripped off from Lethal Weapon 2. When Riggs reached out and pushed the button that releases the container poised high above and it drops and crushes Pieter, the same scene was used in this movie. Chad (Van Damme) pushed the button and released container high above that drops on Griffith and crushes him to death! That is the problem I have with this film.I already mentioned I like this movie a bit more than Kickboxer mainly Van Damme is far more better than he was in Kickboxer, but of all those two movies would be hard for me to pick as best. I am giving a 10, because the movie has a good action and nice martial arts, but it also does have a plot hole that I don't like.10/10 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Columbia Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Stone Group Pictures Vision International Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Geoffrey Lewis, Alonna Shaw, Alan Scarfe, Philip Chan, Bolo Yeung, Corrina Everson Director Sheldon Lettich Producers Jean-Claude Van Damme, Paul Michael Glaser, Ashok Amritraj Screenplay Sheldon Lettich, Ismail Abdo Story by Sheldon Lettich, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steve Meerson, Peter Krikes Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 50 Mins.

That man was Sheldon Lettich, a director, writer and producer to some of Van Damme's early successes like Bloodsport (1988) and Lionheart (1990). Yet even with Lettich not taking part in all of Van Damme's productions, a number of the same writing elements worked their way into each screenplay. Up to this film, almost every film starring Van Damme portrayed a character who had nothing to lose and went into a situation that seemed practically hopeless but pulled through despite the odds. Initially, this formula works a couple times but it does become apparent very quickly. Interestingly enough, this movie has a number of similarities as well, but in some ways it also feels like it's parodying that to some degree.Again directed and written by Sheldon Lettich along with Van Damme, the story is about two brothers named Chad and Alex Wagner (played by Van Damme) who end up being separated as babies after a mob hit on their family because of a construction agreement between China and the US. Fathering Chad in the US is Frank Avery (Geoffrey Lewis) a good friend of his parents. As for Alex, his childhood took place in China where the mob hit happened. After 25 years, Frank and Chad head to China and meet up with Alex and his girlfriend Danielle Wilde (Alonna Shaw). Together they search for the truth to whether the mob hit was due to protest or if it was from the inside, ordered by Nigel Griffith (Alan Scarfe). Watching close by is another deadly archenemy of the Wagners named Moon (Bolo Yeung) who acquired an equally deadly looking scar from Avery during the mob hit. As an overall product of the story, it's entertainment fluff. Like stated before, the writing uses the usual Van Damme formula and somewhat puts it on its head.Again, Van Damme plays a character(s) with nothing to lose (other than one friend) and set out to get back what's rightfully theirs. There's also a subplot where Alex becomes jealous about his brother who believes he's out to sleep with his girlfriend (it doesn't go far). The most noticeable problem in the writing is that the motivation to attain what is rightfully the Wagner brother's is ultimately lost in the execution. Like several other Van Damme flicks, the whole run time is based on revenge and that's it. There's nothing more than that but once it's realized, the story feels kind of shallow. The characters do help the story though. Jean-Claude Van Damme as two brothers would seem unnecessary but he ends up pulling it off decently. Van Damme plays both characters like they know how to use firearms and fight. Chad is more innocent by nature than his brother. Alex on the other hand is a much more gruff and no-nonsense type of guy. It's also nice with the distinguishable contrasts between them, that way viewers will know the difference.The other two actors who give the film an entertainment boost are performances by Geoffrey Lewis and Bolo Yeung. Geoffrey Lewis has always had underrated roles in film and this one is no different. Lewis playing the father figure to one of the Van Damme characters is mostly believable and they both have acceptable chemistry on screen. It's difficult not to enjoy Lewis' roles. The same goes for Yeung who continuously casts himself in villain roles. Although Moon is nowhere near as memorable as his role in Bloodsport (1988) as Chong Li, Yeung still looks like he had fun and his presence is still one that is not to be messed with. The action is nicely integrated into the direction of the film. There are plenty of shootouts and fistfights, all of which show Van Damme's skill. And yes, for those who have to see Van Damme doing his signature split, he does that too. The cinematography looked competently shot too. Behind the camera for this production was Richard H. Kline best known for his work on The Andromeda Strain (1971), The Mechanic (1972), King Kong (1976), Star Trek The Motion Picture (1979), and Body Heat (1981). There's a mix of shots that range between Hong Kong China and island rendezvous points that look gorgeous due to the sheer lushness of the tropical landscape. Plus, Kline's work and with several tricks, the ability to keep Van Damme playing two characters at once looks real. There's only one questionable shot that looks spliced on top of each other but everything else looks like it was Van Damme had a twin. The music was a disappointment though. Composed by Arthur Kempel, the orchestral cues sound organic but there really isn't much to say about them other than it sounds like it belongs to a movie and has music appropriate for the setting with several percussion instruments. It is quite forgettable.The story takes other elements from previous Van Damme films and turns it on its side with Van Damme playing his own double. It is different and it works out but its execution just leads to more action fluff, which isn't bad, just empty. The characters are likable along with forgettable music, but that's it. "}{"Title":"Quick Reviews!!","Date":"6 May 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime","Review":" One of Van Damme's best, and the first in many 'dual roles', Double Impact has strong martial arts scenes mixed with some old style gun action, some good performances, and a typical story which works well. With a bigger budget Van Damme was able to hire better writers, directors, and actors, and here it shows. Still, there is nothing new story-wise but it is exciting, explosive, and should definitely be seen by those even with a passing interest in the action genre.Van Damme plays two twins separated at birth after their parents were brutally murdered by a gang-lord. Chad is raised in Paris by Frank- a friend of his parents, and his old bodyguard, and he has had a quiet, safe life where he is a fitness instructor and martial artist. His lost twin is a small time hood called Alex who lives with his girlfriend in Hong Kong. Alex has been raised alone and has had a difficult life where he has learnt to become street smart, tough, and wary of outsiders. When Chad finds out about his brother he travels to Hong Kong to find him. Alex doesn't care, especially as Chad is so damn nice and naive, but he becomes paranoid about his Chad's relationship with his girlfriend Danielle. They find out that the group that killed their parents is in town for a major deal, and soon prepare for revenge. However, the bad guy Griffith has an army of defenders including femme fatale Kara, Raymond Zang, and good old Bolo Yeung. The brothers must confront their differences if they are to avenge their parents.The story and characters are basic, but Van Damme does a good job in portraying the two in a different manner, and is helped by a fine supporting cast. Some of the dialogue is of course funny like most in the genre, and if you are not a fan of the genre you will probably not ever see this. However it has many good fights and strong action, and the actors are likable enough so if you are not a fan you should give it a try before any of Van Damme's earlier movies. This was a step towards action and away from pure martial arts for Van Damme, and it was his best film so far.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Another good Van Damme flick","Date":"12 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime","Review":"  I think this is probably Van Damme's 2nd best flick after Universal Soldier.

For the first, Hong Kong is the location for the movie. For the second, it has Bolo Yeung in it as a bad guy. As usual, he barely speaks.

Jump forward 25 years where Frank & Chad (co-producer Jean-Claude Van Damme) run a Californian karate studio, Frank has tracked Chad's twin brother Alex (Jean-Claude Van Damme again) down in Hong Kong & together they fly out there. Frank introduces the two & reveal that their parents were murdered by a Triad gang run by slimy businessman Nigel Griffith (Alan Scarfe) & underworld boss Raymond Zhang (Philip Chang), Frank convinces them to join forces, take them both down & avenge their parents...Co-written, co-produced & directed by Sheldon Lettich this is the first time JCVD plays twins although it wouldn't be the last, Double Impact was one of JCVD's earlier efforts just prior to his first big hit Universal Soldier (1992) & I didn't think it was anything special. The script by Lettich & JCVD (I wonder which one thought up the sex scene where JVCD gets to do the business with Danielle...) is a pretty by-the-numbers out for revenge action flick, the added interest of having two JCVD's doesn't really add anything to the film & some may actually see this as a reason to avoid Double Impact. It's all rather predictable with all the bad guy's not being able to shoot straight, not being able to fight properly & are just generally incompetent while the good guy's hit everything they shoot at, they can take an absolute pounding yet walk away with minor cuts & bruises & of course they never, ever run out of bullets while they seem able to avoid the attentions of the local police despite running around beating people up, killing people & destroying property. The story itself isn't particularly engrossing or original, the dialogue isn't that good, it's full of clichés, the character's are poor & the action scenes are repetitive. To be honest it moves along at a reasonable pace, it never bores, there are the usual unintentionally funny moments because of bad scripting, duff editing or horrible acting so I suppose it entertains on a dumb brainless action flick level but there are much better examples out there if you take the time to look.Director Lettich does OK but it's all rather generic, bland & a touch lifeless. There's nothing particularly memorable here, there are a few predictably one sided martial arts fights, shoot outs & a few explosions although how did the fire on the boat magically put itself out? The entire hull full of flammable barrels explode yet in the very next shot the boat is fine & there isn't a single flame anywhere to be seen! Most of the scenes involving JCVD as twins is achieved through doubles & not showing them together in the same frame but when the film does the effects are less than satisfactory although ironically these days you could probably do the split screen thing with more convincing results on a home PC today with a decent movie making package. Other than that Lettich has Alex smoke a cigar whenever he's on screen as a sort of trademark while he has Chad dress in brightly coloured tight fitting clothes neither of which are very subtle. The fights are OK but get sort of boring as JCVD never seems to get injured or tired & they are just so one sided.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 Double Impact did reasonable business, it's well made using nice enough locations in Hong Kong & I particularly liked the ending which is set on-top of a huge crane. The acting isn't that good, JCVD can't act, Geoffrey Lewis is awful & no-one else impressed either. Porn actress & low budget horror film starlet Julie Strain makes an early screen appearance.Double Impact is an average JCVD vehicle, it doesn't make much sense when you think about it & generally speaking it's pretty predictable but if your looking for a few mindless fights & a few laughs then this will pass the time harmlessly enough.

In Chad, he's playing a virginal naive dork. In Alex, he's a harden street-wise hustler. He's better at Alex than Chad. I don't buy him as Chad and it felt wrong in a cheesy way. It's a role that stretches him too far. It's also noteworthy that the two characters are so far apart. Van Damme is simply not skilled enough to make subtle differences count.

But he never succeeded breaking into big budget movies, although he was a bankable star (this movie grossed 80M). It took Jackie Chan 30 years to do it, so maybe we shouldn't be so hard on JC.Interestingly, Ms Olympia Cori Everson makes a guest appearance as the female heavy for the gangs.

As it goes, Van Damme doesn't do a very good job in either role, although his take on Alex is mildly amusing.

Both Van Damme characters learn martial arts, they go on adventure. And the return of an old foe. Bolo Yeung was known as Chong Li in Bloodsport. This time he's known as Moon, one of the few henchman who was responsible for the parents death. He displayed his raw power in this movie than he did in Bloodsport.

It looks flashy, action ready! First thing you see when looking at the cover is van damme sporting a ripped physique and look of primal fury hidden beneath his hardened grimace! If you've never really thought about it, isn't that what every action cover looks like! They really don't need to change it any time soon cause guys appreciate that kinda of honesty. If the graphic artists who design the covers didn't feel the need to make it artsy, It would most certainly be JCVD (Jean Claude Van-Damme) on the cover booting someone in the head! Probably the same guy he's been kicking around like a toy for the last 5 Cannon films. If you didn't already know that's the film company that made him their personal tool for nearly a decade. *Shakes Head* But you want to hear about the movie so here it is!The plot is unbearable! The whole evil guy kills parents, offspring (JCVD) come back for some reprisal, and lastly the high-kicking energetic climax! The only climax I saw was the part where Cory Everson frisks Alonna Shaw and whispers you can frisk me which if you had a line graph depicting total excitement it would look like a single blip on a heart beat monitor. At this point the movie has already been disemboweled and they make no attempt to stitch it up at all. Nope they throw a white sheet over it without even drawing the chalk outlines.The acting is an atrophy. After this movie someone should'a forced Geoffrey Lewis to sit in a corner and sulk until film-makers stopped calling his agent! It's that bad! Alan Scarfe on the other hand delivers in his role playing Nigel Griffith, an elite mobster. Phillip Chan gets his proper role in this one too! Playing the trigger-man Raymond Zhang, the Asian Tony Soprano.It's your average appallingly bad Jean Claud Van-Damme performance.But since when did acting ever matter when you can kick urself in the head standing straight up. I think I phoned his fight choreographer right after thinking about that and suggested they implement it into his next action sequence as a feint in which he deceives his opponents. He turned me down but I'm sure they implemented the now golden flying splits kick in which he can strike opponents to the head even though he may be five feet away from them at the moment of impact!*Final words!* If your drunk this movie is flawless, If your not drunk, it's got about as many holes as a cannon ball riddled union jack mast!

I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent.  The actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story.  However, the film is all down hill from there. It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise.  That is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills.  One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms.  How convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.The plot, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous.  My favorite scenes?  How about when Van Damne is confronting an armed soldier with an AK-47.  The soldier is about 100 yards away.  Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him.  Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him,...while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. This movie has one of the most disappointing endings.  Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist.  However, instead of choreographing a decent fight.  Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong.  Absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise.  If your a Van Damne fan, save your time and see Hard Target or one of his earlier films.

The rest of the cast fall in around JCVD well enough.

Like all revenge flicks, it has villains you'd love to throw out of a plate-glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist, racist, and venomous social stereotypes that invaded Eye for an Eye and Death Wish 2.But in the plot department Double Impact is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys were talking in French accents is a lousy one. It wasn't the watery plot that made this movie bad, but the use of clichéd lines and moves from other movies (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made it worse. But nonetheless Double Impact is still watchable.

Twenty-five years later, the twin babies become two sexy martial arts sensations with strong Belgian accents (both played by Jean Claude Van Damme) who vow to avenge the death of their parents.For the first thirty-five minutes, I really enjoyed Double Impact. Jean-Claude Van Damme has this cool, confident and sometimes cocky persona that is often entertaining. Some of his martial arts sequences are fun to watch as well. Then the onslaught of shoot outs with machine guns and automatic guns and explosions came along and the movie tanked. I have not had any personal experiences where, armed with only two handguns, I had to kill several people who were firing automatic machine guns at me. But if I was in that situation, I suspect I would at the very least sustain several injuries, even if I was an action star. Yet there are several scenes in Double Impact where Jean-Claude Van Damme successfully takes on three Chinese criminals, armed with machine guns, and emerges unscathed. When the hero does that well in several gun fights, it sucks the excitement out of the movie. We no longer have any reason to be concerned for his safety, because we know he is invincible. As a result, the shootouts -- which presumably are meant to generate the most excitement -- are tedious and boring.The other problem with the movie are the explosions. When I saw my first explosion in an action movie at age ten, I admit I was impressed. But since then, I have grown tired of them. Watching explosions in movies, like Double Impact, is like eating doughnuts, potato chips and drinking pop drinks all day long. At the end, I get this sick feeling inside. The problem with Double Impact is that there are so many explosions and so much property damage that it smothers the plot and the dialogue. I had so much more fun watching Jean-Claude Van Damme showcasing remnants of both his characters, Alex and Chad. Then the explosions, shooting and full sound came along and ruined it all. I was also hopeful in the beginning that this movie would have some kind of plot. But Double Impact has no plot after 30 minutes. Danielle Wilde (who is played by the stunning blonde model Alonna Shaw) has a bit part as Alex's girlfriend and secretary to Mr. Griffiths and she spends most of her on screen time rummaging through Griffiths' files to see if he was responsible for killing Alex's parents. Danielle's role, as far as I can tell, is to generate interest in a plot bereft of ideas (not even Alfred Hitchcock would pull this stunt). Danielle's investigative work is inconsequential because Alex and Chad have already made up their minds to wipe out Griffiths, Zhang and the Triads. The same has to be said for the female villain Kara (Corinna Everson) who combines violence with sexually assaulting Danielle. Kara's purpose, as a lesbian stereotype, is to help the producers of this film hedge their bets by adding some cheap thrills in a film that has run out of good ideas. A third source of cheap thrills is the sex scene involving Danielle and one of the Jean-Claude Van Damme characters, which really shows how low the producers were willing to go to sell this movie. Overall Double Impact was a big disappointment. 3.5/10 "},{"Title":"Double Damn","Date":"20 March 2011","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime","Review":" In this early-90s no-brainer Van Damme was convinced that there wasn't enough of him (at 5'8'' this may be true) and played duel roles of Chad and Alex Wagner, twins out to avenge the death of their parents. It's simple, it's straight-up, and none the worse for it really.Chad (or Alex, I forget which) lives in Beverly Hills with his 'Uncle' Frank, who inexplicably raised him in France (thus explaining the axe-ont), until the day he is told that he has a legacy in Hong Kong. Upon arrival in HK Chad discovers Alex (or vice versa), his twin brother he never knew he had (who was raised by French nuns, thus explaining the axe-ont). The two are polar opposites and don't get on, but they have to put their differences aside in order to tear the Triads a new one.I'll be honest, I can't really follow the plot. There's something about a tunnel and 'shipments', but I'm really just watching in order to see bad guys get blown away. Bolo Yeung plays the lead henchman, and he's one evil mofo. He may not have a lot of dialogue but pure malevolence comes through with every gesture, tick, and mannerism. He's a character straight of a beat-em-up video game, the kind you'd lose three or four continues fighting.The film doesn't really feel like an American product. The production design, cinematography, and editing give it the look of a John Woo movie from the same era. Van Damme's acting is pretty bad, but his personality makes up for it. Though he clearly liked the idea of having more than one of him in the same movie as he repeated the idea in Timecop, Maximum Risk, and Replicant.And, is it just me, or do not enough action movies have lesbian villains?
