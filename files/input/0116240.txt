Critics gave it bad reviews. Part of the issue was the original Terms of Endearment was made back in 1983. So when some of the cast came back 13 years later, it can lose some of its box office draw. However, the time that passed actually made this movie more believable as the characters had also aged. Shirley MacLaine reprises her role and does a nice job, trying to raise her dead daughter's children. The movie stays grounded by dealing with everyday issues as well as getting older and the trials of a non-traditional family. Paxton plays a nice role in this film adding a little flare to the shadowing plot of Shirley MacLaine's character getting older. Nicholson's return, although brief, helped this film round itself out.

It contains more laughs then Terms of Endearment and also less depth. But if you watch this movie in the observation that it is solely entertainment, and not to be taken seriously, it's a lot of fun.Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine- reprising her Oscar winning role) is now dealing with her three grown Grandchildren. One is a saint, Teddy, who is already married with child. Tommy, the problem child of the original film, is in prison. And Melanie (Juliette Lewis), the youngest, is struggling through college because she's going through a rebellious phase and likes hanging out with her sleazy boyfriend, or mooching off Patsie (Miranda Richardson), the now very rich divorc√©e. There's also the loyal housekeeper Rosie (Marion Ross), who despite always being on her duties and quick to have a sarcastic comeback, is falling in love with the next door neighbor Arthur (Ben Johnson- in his last screen performance).All of this is a little hokey, but the performances more then make up for it. When Aurora starts seeing a therapist (Bill Paxton) and then sleeping with him, people start whispering about her reputation. And when Melanie keeps going back and forth between her relationship, she finally finds peace with Aurora, who she at first despised.The Evening Star is by no means superior to Terms of Endearment. That movie is a landmark in it's own right. But it is more fun- in my opinion. MacLaine, in a funny performance, seems more lively and witty here then her original time around. And the most fun of all is to watch her and Miranda Richardson go at it - almost like Grumpy Old Men- but FUNNIER. A scene in an airplane perfectly displays their hatred for one another- but in a way, they are best friends- since they're always around each other, competing, gossiping or nagging.To wrap it up, it's a long movie with a lot of unnecessary subplots (the death toll was ridiculous), but keep in mind this is also based on the book, so do we blame the filmmakers or the author? The Evening Star is a movie that should be watched for a good laugh. You don't have to have seen the first one to understand it. True, Debra Winger is missing (but if you saw the first film you'd know why), but I am rating this solely on how well it entertained me.

I have an even greater respect for my mother and the education she gave me.Yet Aurora still manages to make the same mistakes we all make. Love is not an easy road traveled.This movie brings humor to that road, tears just like the original movie. I will agree the airplane scene was over the top, but I loved the scene with Jack Nicholson on the beach with the car going through the surf. I have never read the books, but now I really want to.One interesting fact - almost every star in this movie is a daughter or son of someone in Hollywood - Teddy was Patty Duke and John Astin's son. Tommy's wife is Cary Grant and Diane Cannon's daughter, Teddy's wife is someone from Jefferson Airplane's daughter.

However, as a sequel to Terms of Endearment, the movie is mostly middling.The plot line starts off about fifteen to sixteen years after Terms ended. The grandchildren are now all grown, and each has their own problems. Aurora remains the queen bee, but feels like she is losing her family, as her grandchildren resent her interfering and blame her for their current state. Added to the mix is Patsy, Emma's rich best friend and Aurora's nemesis who feels like she could have done a better job raising Melanie. Also along for the ride is Rosie, Aurora's long term maid and companion.The movie mainly follows Aurora as she attempts to deal with life, by dating various men and trying to put her grandchildren on the right path.There are a number of problems with this movie. The first being the complete lack of Flap Horton, the children's father. Here, he has no role in his children's lives, and he is only briefly mentioned as living in New Mexico. The second issue is the character of Melanie. She is essentially a stand in for Emma in this movie, but the dynamic between her and Aurora is underdeveloped and does not work very well. The other two grandchildren, Tommy and Teddy, are even more underdeveloped. The fourth issue is the virtual cavalcade of death this movie becomes in its second half where three main characters die! The one positive note is the Patsy/Aurora relationship. Both actresses have a good chemistry and play well off each other. You can feel the way each resents the other, but it is also understood that at the end of the day, there is a grudging respect.So overall, not a bad movie, but don't watch it expecting another Terms.

It may start off on a boring start, but soon you will find yourself very involved with the characters and the multi-story plot, just like Terms. Shirley MacLaine handled herself pretty well in this, maybe even more so than Terms, but Miranda Richardson and Juliette Lewis seem out of place and they overact sometimes.

When Terms of Endearment ended, I believe it was supposed to be around 1973, not 1983/Present day like someone else stated. Because of that, Melanie's age was accurate. Second of all, I saw The Evening Star before I even saw Terms of Endearment because I'm only 14 years old and was not alive yet to have seen it in the theatres and at the time Evening Star came out, had not even heard of Terms. I saw the Evening Star, absolutely LOVED it, memorized every line, and have seen it 83 times and counting. In response to another user comment, such hokey lines like Teddy's to Melanie, I remember hugs, lots of hugs, mom was big on hugs, are not hokey at all! Lines like those really stir up the past accurately. He is describing his mother basically, and the character of Emma was a very warm, loving person who cared for her kids more than anyone else in the world. I guess she just wanted to hold on to us for as long as she could follows that. Not hokey - Touching. Anyone who would think that is hokey probably thinks that the Jerry Springer show is a touching, good family kind of program. Overall, the movie was one of the best I've ever seen and equally matches Terms of Endearment. One of the best sequels of our time! Shirley MacLaine played Aurora beautifully as she did the first time around, Marion Ross did a fabulous job as Rosie and really brought her character to life. Remember, in Terms of Endearment, Rosie had only a few lines. She was played by another woman and was in no way a main character. Marion Ross had to create that character all on her own and did a fabulous job. Miranda Richardson as well, Juliette Lewis, Mackenzie Astin, everybody. I think they all did a fantastic job. Jack Nicholson was a small part in the movie, yes, but the beach scene is what really brings it all to life. I love that movie just as much now as I did the first time I saw it.

Much of the acting is quite good - MacLaine is, as usual, eminently watchable, Juliette Lewis does another of her typically strong turns, and never has Marion Ross been given a better opportunity to demonstrate her surprising range.  Still, credible acting and an 11th hour appearance of (an embarrassed-looking) Jack Nicholson can only do so much for this contrived mess, and one cannot help but wonder why they couldn't leave well enough alone.

Her daughter quit school and caught having sex with her boyfriend. She decides to see a shrink at the forceful request of her maid. This leads to fornication and a sense of freedom.

Director Robert Harling does a fine job at continuing this family and is backed with beautiful photography. MacLaine holds strong as a woman needing a break from routine responsibilities. Juliette Lewis plays her daughter who aims to be an actress. Miranda Richardson plays a nosy neighbor whom MacLaine dislikes because she is closer to her daughter than she is. Bill Paxton plays a shrink with a showgirl mother. Their affair is predicted but her dealing with it is right.

I read Evening Star as soon as it came out. I was a little hesitant to see that they were making the sequel. Maybe because I am secretly clairvoyant because this movie is a MESS. Oh my God, where do I start? Well, the beauty of TOE was that it covered the lives of Emma and Aurora since she was in the crib through her adolescence and adulthood until her untimely death. We grew to know the characters and love them or not. Well in ES, it's just a mishmash of several plots over the course of at most several months (!!!). Also the casting was strange. Juliette Lewis was awful but she was high on heroin the whole time so that would explain her awful performance. Marion Ross as Rosie was miscast. And where the HELL is Lisa Hart Carroll as Patsy??? Instead we get Miranda Richardson who was just terrible and SOOO not Patsy.I put most of the blame for this mess on Robert Harling. He had a hit with Steel Magnolias, and he obviously is in love with the idea of a tearjerker. However, this screenplay is so overloaded with excess drama and attempts to bring a tear that you end up feeling used and angry. He totally changed the screenplay from the actual book.I could go on and on and on about how awful this movie was, but I'll spare you. I suppose if I'd never grown up on TOE this movie might not make me so angry. But then they should have had a different actress play Aurora and just a whole new cast, which they basically did anyway.

After the success of the original Terms of Endearment, it was no surprise a sequel was in the works. In fact, as a viewer, I loved finding out what happened to the existing characters. I know at the end of Terms of Endearment, Flap Horton agreed to have Emma's mother raise his children---In this one, he seems to abandon them all together, which I don't think Flap--even though he is a rotter---would he do this? Well, on with the plot...Not all happy endings after Emma's death. Tommy is in jail, Teddy is somewhat nebbish but seems to try and do the right thing at times. Baby Melanie has grown into a pretty but defiant boy crazy teen which drives strong willed Aurora even more crazy.In The Evening Star we see two new character--one old in the earlier film who now has a much bigger part---Rosie Dunlop, Aurora's maid superbly acted by Marion Ross (who played Mrs C in Happy Days) Here we see Rosie had a much greater impact on Aurora's life as not just a maid but as an extended family member. And Rosie feels the same way as she tries to guide Aurora thru life's problems. This time Aurora suffers besides her grandchildrens crisis, she seems to be going thru a change of life or mid life crisis. On advise, she goes to a psychiatrist, played by Bill Paxton, who seems half her age.---and seduces him. I know that this seems to show the audience that Aurora, even though she approaches her elderly years--that she still has got it. It just seems as a silly superficial not needed sub plot line.One of the most disappointing outcome of the characters from the past movie is Emma's best friend, Patsy Carpenter. In the original movie, Patsy was a self sufficient, sleek well groomed career girl. In the Evening Star somehow she has morphed into a debauched drunken alcoholic only after the money from men that she preys on. She and Aurora are immensely jealous of each other and compete from Emma's children attention and love. I suppose this sub plot is put in for comic relief, it just seems so silly and detached from the characters.And of course, Aurora's love Garret comes back for a brief appearance but jack Nicholson just doesn't have the same pizazz as before. He seems to look as someone is making him star in this movie--just my imagination-you be the judge.The remainder of the film, now focuses on the end of Aurora's days after all her grandchildren have come to terms with there problems. It is very sad and will probably make you think of the emotional scene of Emma's death. The Evening Star is an entertaining film to watch.

The problems with this shamelessly manipulative movie are many, and they all begin with the inevitable premise that tough Texas matron Aurora Greenway can carry on without being challenged by her feisty daughter Emma. However, without Debra Winger's earthy grit counterbalancing Shirley MacLaine's flamboyant disapproval, the story seems to work in a vacuum. Much of the appeal and resonance of the first film was how these characters dealt with life's unpredictable course and how James L. Brooks captured their idiosyncrasies with a refreshing level of honesty for a mainstream film.That point is completely missed as Robert Harling takes over for Brooks and takes the episodic approach that seemed to work for his screenplay for 1989's Steel Magnolias. Based on Larry McMurtry's sequel novel, the story picks up Aurora's story fifteen years after Emma's death as we see true to her daughter's final wishes, that the grandiose older woman has raised Emma's three children. Now adults, oldest son Tommy is in prison for drug dealing, while youngest son Teddy has become standard white trash who wants only to own a tow truck. That leaves granddaughter Melanie who has inherited her mother's independent streak as she struggles in a bad relationship with an aspiring underwear model. Without Emma, Melanie picks up the slack and so do two minor characters from the first film - Emma's best friend Patsy, who has become a wealthy divorc√©e constantly competing with Aurora, and Aurora's salt-of-the-earth maid Rosie.The movie becomes a virtual traffic jam of personal problems orbiting around Aurora with the second half an endless series of dramatic climaxes. MacLaine does the best she can under the circumstances, but the rest of the cast is set adrift. Bill Paxton looks particularly lost as the psychotherapist in love with Aurora. Juliette Lewis uses her familiar off-kilter mannerisms as Melanie, while Miranda Richardson is forced to play Patsy on two notes - petulant jealousy and benign resignation. Nicholson's appearance is welcome, but he understandably looks like he wants to leave the minute he arrives to remind Aurora of her enduring appeal. Only Marion Ross and Ben Johnson acquit themselves respectably as Rosie and her husband-to-be Arthur. Except for MacLaine's work, this overlong slog is really unbearable to watch. The 2001 DVD offers no significant extras.

One grandson is in prison and her granddaughter is as stubborn as her daughter Emma played by Debra Winger was. Also Miranda Richardson plays a Texan friend that wanted to raise Emma. Also Marion Ross is cast in the role as Rosie Dunlop, Aurora's maid or housekeeper.

The movie opens in 1988 and Melanie is a college student. Terms of Endearment ended present-day (1983), and Melanie was only 2 or 3 at the time. But, however, if you can ignore the timedates, this is a relatively enjoyable sequel. Aurora's character is more exhilarating and not so glum, but she's still a major control freak. Jack Nicholson has only about 10 minutes of screen time, and is much more mannered than comical, like the original. For hard core Terms fans only.

Where are the original actors there's no jeff Daniels, no Danny DE Vito, the character of patsy was slim and pretty and smart and sophisticated in the first film but now shes replaced by some heavier actress who just acts dumb all the way through. Terms of endearment was one of the best films i ever saw but this one makes it look really bad. Too long and drawn out and what a shame that all the children turned out bad and that there father isn't in the picture. In the first he seemed to be there a lot but, how can he just never see them again after his wife dies how does that happen.

I know the entire movie by heart, text and all.  I don't know how many times I have seen it but suffice to say its plenty. So when the opportunity to see the sequel arose, I must admit I was curious and hopeful.  However, after ten minutes watching this became an ordeal.  MacLaine brings none of Aurora's charm to this outing and all the actors around her are just as flat. A scene on an airplane between Aurora and Patsy (Miranda Richardson, inexplicably) is a total embarrassment and I can't believe MacLaine allowed it. Marion Ross as the housekeeper seems to be channeling Agnes Moorehead in Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte, and not very well, at that. There is a moment between Nicholson and MacLaine that suggests the magic of Terms, but that's only one moment.The movie has value as Ben Johnson's last appearance, but little else.

Well, what I understood was that dates were not necessarily expressed in Terms and that Debra Winger's character had actually died in 1973 - with fifteen years added to Melanie's age of three when her mother died, that would account for her being a college freshman in 1988.  Marion Ross was NOT in the original movie - another actress had played Rosie.  Nor was Miranda Richardson.  But I was annoyed that Ms. Ross was not even nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal in this film - she deserved it and then some!

You loved characters from a certain film and wanted to see them again, or the original film left some open ends you'd like to see tied up. These marketing tools very rarely live up to a real film, never mind surpassing it, like in Christopher Reeve's version of Superman. Most of the time, they're unnecessary at best, and vomitous at worst. Yes, dear readers, The Evening Star is Cinematic Ipecak. If queasy film-goers think they're made to vomit at horror films, just wait until they see this one. It's not a horror movie in the traditional sense, it's a horror OF a move in every sense.I did mention this contains spoilers, but viewers' appetites don't count here No, really, I remember so little of this except for three scenes which I thought were just hilarious 1- Melanie, played by the never-to-be-Oscar-winning Juliette Lewis (who I understand was a much worse mental case than Debra Winger), spouts off at Aurora (during a fight the two have about her latest boyfriend) I love him - I HATE YOU! 2- The fact that Tommy's been in prison all this time and LIVED TO BE RELEASED! If he acted the way he acted in the first film, he'd have been Bruno's special friend in the pokey, not to mention deserving the death penalty for being such a....such a....AAAHH I can't even find the right adjective. Oh, he was just a pig.3- Aurora's stroke while sitting at the piano with some kid. I needn't add anything else to it. 'Nuff said! James L. Brooks was NOT associated with this. Larry Mc Murtry's actual follow-up novel was NOT the basis for this. Lisa Hart Carroll was NOT Patsy. Yes, the great Miranda Richardson was NOT so great in this.Bill Paxton (wherever HE is these days - Twister II, anyone?) was okay in this, and it's always nice to see Jack, but it wasn't long enough. Now that I think of it, Paxton resembles Jack a little. Maybe there was a missing subplot about him being Garrett's and Aurora's son who was put away in an institution because post menopausal ladies usually give birth to children with severe birth defects. Paxton's choice in acting in this piece of schlock was truly a defective one and he should be institutionalized. HEY WAIT A MINUTE - MAYBE HE WAS (heh-heh).This sits very prettily on the perch of the four very worst sequels ever made EXORCIST II THE HERETIC - Blatty didn't write - Friedkin didn't direct. Blair didn't act. Yeah, she's in it, but she still doesn't act.ARTHUR II ON THE ROCKS - Come on, guys! Romantic fantasies are supposed to have the couple living happily ever after. An amusing fairy tale was turned into a soap opera by an individual in his/her first week of literacy classes in hopes of obtaining a GED.STAYING ALIVE - As could be said in Johnny Dangerously, I saw this ONCE! Sequel to Saturday Night Fever - fevers usually make you feel sick and can sometimes kill you, even robbing you of your powers of either sight, hearing, or speech, as in the case of Helen Keller.YEP - this'll do it!

Yet, certainly the script for this continuation of Terms of Endearment sounded an alarm, as it is incredibly dull. Writer-director Robert Harling, working from another novel by Larry McMurtry, probably bears most of the blame, but were audiences even eager to embrace a follow-up to Terms 13 years later? Returning to her Oscar-winning role as feisty Texan Aurora Greenway, MacLaine can't possibly be expected to have the same chemistry with a new troupe of actors as she had in the first film (we grew up with those characters in the course of the picture, and here everyone is dropped on us unceremoniously, with little intros of who's-who). MacLaine, playing grandmother to her deceased daughter's three now-grown children, is in full Aurora mode, but tellingly the only two sequences that work are the ones MacLaine shares with former co-star Jack Nicholson. Otherwise, it's a completely uninspired venture that leaves one cold. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Better Than The Original","Date":"31 December 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  As I said in the comment box above, this is better than the original, which was Terms Of Endearment (1983). A lot of people think that this is inferior to the original. But this, unlike most sequels, brings much more insight into the characters and everything else in the story, and is more interesting. Rosie only had 2 scenes in the original, but is in most of this! This is continuing the story of Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) in her latter years. After the death of her daughter Emma, Aurora struggled to keep her family together, but has one grandson named Tommy (George Horton) in jail who hates her, a rebellious granddaughter named Melanie (Juliette Lewis) who moves to Los Angeles with her unfaithful boyfriend Bruce (Scott Wolf), and another grandson named Teddy (Mackenzie Astin) living just above the poverty line. Aurora's maid Rosie (Marion Ross) tricks Aurora to see a psychiatrist named Jerry (Bill Paxton), who's 40-something years her junior. As their relationship builds, her friends are getting concerned about it and her dead daughter's friend Patsy (Miranda Richardson) decides to ruin it.As I said before, this film brings much more insight than the original. You get to realize how much of the tragedy of this 1st film is Patsy's fault, since she `corrupted' Emma and Aurora, after many years of knowing each other, finally confronts her about it, which I guess brings some justice to Aurora. Juliette Lewis gives a good performance (as always) in this film. If you liked her work here, then you'll love her work in Natural Born Killers (1994). Even Jack Nicholson's small role in this (which is only about 10 minutes) is nice to see. And you get to know towards the later part of the film how the `Aurora Greenway Saga' ends. If you're a fan of the original, then you should watch this, but just like the original, it's not a great film, but worth watching.Rating 3/5  "},{"Title":"Best movie made!","Date":"13 October 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  I LOVEEEEEEE this movie!

MacLaine's three grandkids are grown now and nothing is the way she would like. Oldest grandson George Newbern is in prison, Mackenzie Astin is stuck in a dead-end job and has children of his own and grand-daughter Juliette Lewis seems just as lost as Winger was in the original. Marion Ross and Miranda Richardson take on roles that were originally played by different actresses and this just does not feel quite right. Bill Paxton is hilarious as MacLaine's much younger love interest. Neighbor Donald Moffatt and his servant Ben Johnson (in the great actor's swan song) are also along for the ride. The Evening Star is not a bad film, but it pales so much to its predecessor that it just cannot be a complete success. It is a film that really had no business being made. Fair at best. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

There are some funny moments in it. Classic Aurora control scenes and blow-off lines. but it'a mess... The title could have been Terms of Endearment 2 Return to the Cash Cow. What could possibly be more unnecessary than a sequel to Terms of Endearment? Because the pivotal relationship was eliminated by Wingers exit in the first film, this sequel has no focus. What had been an amusing take on the funny and sad moments in an erratic mother-daughter relationship, has become a plot less holding pattern. There is no central emotional relationship to care about and the characters have little to do. They have not found a suitable foil for Aurora here. The relationship between Patsy and Aurora which had been quietly disagreeable, is now full-on antagonism. And that's a familiar, unsatisfying device to duct-tape a story onto.If you were wondering what happens next after Terms ended, the answer is that the characters continued living. Whoopee. Star tries to milk tender emotions from you, but those feelings are given no foundation. It just moves on to some new unrelated emotional payload every ten minutes or so. Whether this went on for an hour or three (which it feels like) it just wears you down. The creators fail to understand that extraneous undeveloped characters (who've barely been introduced) can only deliver phony emotional epiphanies. It's so overwritten that superfluous sub-plots are M.I.A. for an hour at a time. It has so many false endings, that I gave up shortly after Nicholsons odd, special-guest-star appearance. He arrives to spout some tender inexplicable pseudo-Oprah drivel. It's like it was written by Edna Ferber. It goes on and on and on...
