Barbra is deep and intellectual, at least she wants to be, but ends up being the ultimate drama queen, I'm not pretty enough for you, am I? and Nobody will ever love you like I do.  Redford is aloof and chilly and beautiful and as shallow as a mud puddle.BUT, if you can watch that last scene, I can't Katie.

Nothing I've seen (I haven't seen a lot, but still) has compared to the chemistry, the depth of feeling, and the realistic portrayal of two opposites both beautiful in their own right.  This movie is a testament to the way we were really, how it was beautiful to be decadent and disgusting in the thriving 50's, of the attractive waspishness of Ivy leaguers, of politics and war.  The movie is not dated either, its quality making it appealing to a whole spectrum of people who would normally not be interested in something this good.  I first saw this movie in a history class and to my surprise most of the people in the class loved it, people who would normally go see Titanic and rave about it for days.  I think that is, if not something else, at least evidence of this movie's depth, quality, feeling, (and although very sentimental) realism.  If you enjoy the finer things in life, dim the lights, fix yourself a vodka martini straight up, and watch The Way We Were.

It's a classy romantic period drama about a 1940s wallflower in New York who blooms in love with her ex-jock boyfriend (an old acquaintance from their college days), and the movie overflows with star-power. None of today's celebrities have the kind of chemistry Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford bring to the screen, and Streisand in particular is so deeply into this character that the herky-jerky editing and breathless writing don't harm her or get in the way (the faults can easily be overlooked). When writer Redford adapts his novel into a screenplay and the couple marries and moves to Hollywood in the McCarthy-Blacklist era, her passion for politics gets them both in hot water; that's where this script hits a snag, with increasingly melodramatic plotting (Redford's affair with a former flame) and confusion in the character motivations (this primarily due to hasty, eleventh-hour editing). Still, it is a handsomely-produced movie with a great tearjerker ending and two fine stars who plow right through the nonsense and bumpy continuity. They transcend the make-believe surroundings, turning the picture into something really special, something to remember. ***1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"One of the best movies of the 70s.......","Date":"24 February 2004","Score":"42 out of 48 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Contains Spoiler I read some of the comments registered here on The Way We Were and felt I needed to add my comments.First of all, I think a lot of people are viewing this movie through politically correct, 21st century eyes.Comments have been made about Redford's character abandoning his kid after he splits with Streisand's character at the end of the movie. However, the movie implies that Streisand's character moves from California back to New York while Redford's character stays in sunny Hollywood. If this were the case, back in the 1940s it was not as common for people to hop on a plane going from coast to coast. It would not be uncommon at that time for a woman to remarry (which Streisand's character does) and have her new husband basically raise the kid. Especially if the natural father was (as in this case) across the other side of the country. Societal customs were much different than they are now concerning extended families and such.The two sides of the country also represent the main characters. Sunny, beautiful, extroverted, physically inclined Hollywood (Redford) on the west coast and the grayer, more complex, intellectually inclined New York on the east coast (Streisand).I'm also surprised at the comments regarding the characters motivations in finding the other attractive. I thought the movie made it very clear & believable. Both characters are acutely aware of their projected image to others and both characters feel trapped by these labels. This is something very significant that they share which bonds them. Redford's character chafes at his pretty boy image yet is at the same time uncomfortable in the role of writer.  When his short story is read in class, he is visibly uncomfortable yet still wants the approval of his classmates. Redford's character wants to be strong yet have a vulnerable artistic side appreciated. So too is Streisand hampered by her image as an intellectual, wise cracking, thick skinned rebel. She, unconsciously perhaps, longs for a man to treat her gently, appreciate her as something more than a spokesperson, more as a unique person, a woman.Each of the characters tentatively pin pricks the other's exterior reserve. Redford by trying to make Streisand smile, relax, not take life so seriously and Streisand by trying to make Redford feel respected and have his writing valued. Each receives from the other something most people won't give them. Streisand is made to feel beautiful and interesting and sexy and something more than just her political beliefs while Streisand lets Redford know that beneath the blond surfer boy looks she sees depth and integrity.The movie also deals with culture clashes within society. Redford's character is the classic White Anglo Saxon Protestant upper class while Streisand the lower class ethnic, non-Christian. That they even consider forging a relationship between the two of them would have raised eyebrows at the time.I'm surprised (though perhaps I missed it) that no one commented on two of the films most famous lines. In an argument near the end of the movie Redford & Streisand battle it out with Redford declaring that people are more important than principles with Streisand answering back that people are their principles.I agree with many that this is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in the 1970s. I think both lead actors were perfectly cast and the period feeling of the WWII era is beautifully rendered.There are many wonderful moments throughout the film. The scene where Redford is out in the ocean on a small sailboat with his good friend and the two are playing the best ever game. When the friend calls out the category as year and Redford starts identifying first one year then another then another as his best or favorite years the viewer knows without being told that the years he's listing are his years he's spent with Streisand. The camera records Redford's bittersweet face and pulls back, showing the friend on the boat silently witnessing his friend's pain, then the camera pulls back in a helicopter shot showing the boat being bounced on the waves. It's an extraordinarily poignant moment in film.As mentioned in other reviews, the shots of Streisand brushing back Redford's hair off his forehead are sexy and intimate without being graphic.Another moment I love is near the end of the film and Streisand says to Redford wouldn't it be wonderful if the two of them were old and they would have survived all of this. Again, with brilliantly written dialogue and performed by professionals the movie accomplishes much depth without resorting to histrionics.I think it's a very romantic film along the lines of Casablanca and Gone With The Wind and Brief Encounter.I say, rent the film, don't try to over analyze it, just relax on the couch either by yourself or with your partner and just enjoy an old fashioned story of boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy loses girl in the end.

One of the most famous examples is Sydney Pollack's 1973 film The Way We Were. Set from the 1930's through the 1950's, Barbra Streisand plays Katie, an outspoken member of the Communist party and campus activist who does not have anything handed to her; she works two and sometimes three jobs in order to pay for her living and college tuition. Hubble (Redford) is your typical aforementioned golden boy, a big man on campus who indulges in sports, debutantes and all-around good times. The two know each other from the diner Katie works at (he being the patron) and at one point before graduation, briefly bond over their shared passion for writing. Cut to a few years in the future and Katie encounters Hubble at a bar. Hubble is in the armed forces and Katie is characteristically working a couple of jobs while volunteering for various social causes. After a night of drunken sex (Hubble being the drunken one) they embark on an unlikely relationship that spans over a decade and includes a move to California (when Hubble becomes a screenwriter in Hollywood) and the conception of one child. They are happy, but realize that regardless of their desire, they can't completely cross social lines and certainly can't change one another, particularly Katie's ever-ferocious dedication to social causes; a fight that becomes exponentially heated during McCarthy's Red Scare. The two have to decide whether they can sustain enough raw emotion for one another to persevere over everything else that is stacked up against them.There are several things about The Way We Were that require suspension of disbelief (the fact that despite never having had much contact with one another that after one night of drunken lust and an awkward morning after being enough to kick start a relationship the magnitude of theirs is the first thing that comes to mind) but the bottom line is that it really is a well-written, well-directed and well-acted film. The two principal characters are full and complex, regardless of whether we are talking about the socially conscience Katie or the socially acceptable Hubble. I suspect they somewhat were written with the intent of familiarity for the purpose of effectiveness, and if this is true, it worked on me. The era in which these two characters were set was a very interesting time in American history, and the characters' actions during these times created some compelling cinema, particularly when it touched on the Red Scare.But who am I fooling? The main reason people watch this movie, whether for the first time or for the fiftieth is for the doomed romance, and Streisand and Redford deliver in spades. The Way We Were was written for Streisand, (something that cause Redford to turn down the part at first, because he knew the film was going to be hers) and her portrayal of Katie is excellent. There are so many perceptions of Streisand nowadays (some of them correct, to be sure) that it's easy to forget that she really does have some serious acting chops, and she exhibits them to full effect here. I also happened to learn that the soft filtered lens thing with her didn't just start with her later movies, for whatever reason she was filmed with that lens more often than not here, but that didn't do anything more than slightly distract me because I couldn't help but chuckle. Redford gives a typical solid performance as well, though his initial doubts about taking the role turned out to be valid; he is not the dynamic figure in the film. However, his character is a strong one and Redford does a good job.I don't know if Pollack knew he was creating a screen classic when he directed The Way We Were but he did make a very good film. If you can make it past some major melodrama and some plot holes (what was the deal with their child?) watch this film, and just sit back and appreciate it for what it is &#150; a chick flick that guys don't have to feel ashamed watching. 7/10 --Shelly "},{"Title":"breathless","Date":"23 August 2002","Score":"28 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Had to see this one again after years had elapsed between viewings, and the hair brushed from the face ending still gets to me. Weep weep, boo hoo. Speaking of hair, Babs looks better with her hair curly here, it always seems stiff flattened out. I still can't figure out if Hubbel was challenged by Katie or if he fell for her because he knew she loved him deeply, even if their relationship was based more on her attraction to him than his to hers. I never thought he truly felt comfortable with her. Because she was so serious all the time, as he tried to tell her. Romance was bound to fail because he could never think about other people the way she did and she in turn could never relax. The public confrontation during the communist witch hunt is the last straw and eventually leads us to the sidewalks of New York, where Katie's hair is curly again and Hubbel comments that she must have lost her iron. A truly moving romance with some stretches of dullness here and there but never at the expense of character. Both stars look great, with Streisand definitely robbed at Oscar time.

It is an attempt to portray a grand love story in the context of serious political questions, but ultimately it ends up as just another soppy romance, pleasurable to watch, but with no real substance or depth. The character of Katie isn't coherent enough at times to make the film work, despite the fact that Striesand is perfectly cast in this role . At college she's cold and abrasive when Hubble makes overtures towards her, but when they meet again years later she acts like a giddy school girl with a crush. There are powerful moments when they argue over principles and the future of their relationship, but the problems that drive them apart aren't explored deeply enough to make it work. It's hard to believe that they could be so deliriously happy when Katie announces she's pregnant, only to have everthing fall to pieces before the baby is even born. Given the supposed depth of their love for each other, Hubble's affair is completely unconvincing, even making allowances for the volatile political situation they find themselves in.The film had great potential to explore the pressures that outside forces can have on two people with very different views who love each other against all the odds, and how these pressures will ultimately take their toll, but it lacks the insight that could have made it a really great film. Instead it opts for the sugar-coated version that's bound to be a crowd pleaser, but leaves the more discerning viewer feeling slightly disappointed and empty.That said, I did like the ending a lot, and believe that Robert Redford is a fine actor. The brief look of intense pain & regret in Hubble's eyes when he is confronted with everything he has lost, and everything that could have been when he meets Katie on the street in New York almost makes up for the rest of the films flaws. He took the easy way out, and is forced to admit this to himself, if only for a moment before he is swept back into his glamourous lifestyle as a screen writer. Katie, on the other hand has stayed true to her beliefs, and she summs it up the fims theme perfectly when she tells Hubble that she likes his girl. It is a girl he has chosen over a woman that could have brought out the very best in him, and helped him to be the kind of man he yearned to be, but didn't have the determination or courage for, and this is where the great tragedy of the film lies. Definitely worth seeing.

Romances were never really my thing, but I had always enjoyed the work of Robert Redford, so I decided to give it a try.  I was floored by the power and beauty of film!  My initial reactions to the film were, once again, how natural and charismatic Redford is as the classic example of the college golden boy, who feels slightly trapped.  After the credits began to roll, I knew right then that I had seen something special, something that would pass the test of time.  I assume others felt the same way, the film went on to become an international blockbuster and the top grosser of the year.Years later, I watched THE WAY WE WERE again.  Now older, I had a new perspective on the film, and to be completely honest, I enjoyed it even more!  While I still think Redford is great in this film, I discovered that it is actually Barbra Streisand who gives the better performance.  As the political activist Katie, Streisand has one her best roles since Fanny Brice in the original FUNNY GIRL and she provides a show-stopping performance. She displays both strength and vulnerability, she is at once both scorned and innocent.  Her's is one of the best performances of the 70's.The final verdict  THE WAY WE WERE stands the test of time as one of the best films of it's kind.  Watch this film for the most moving finale in film history, for the knock out performance from Streisand, for the long-lasting chemistry between Redford and Streisand, and for one of the most famous and touching love stories of this century.Out of 10, I'd rate THE WAY WE WERE a solid 10!

Character development (or arc) is supposed to be one of the basic elements of a good screenplay; but the whole point of Sydney Pollack's 1973 movie is that neither Katie Moroski nor Hubbell Gardner changes. She remains the serious-minded Jewish left-wing activist, and he the easy-going, politically uncommitted WASP, they are when they first meet in college in 1937. Fascinated with each other precisely because they are such opposites, they have an affair, marry and have a baby; but their inability to compromise - or in his case to stop compromising - leads to break-up.The main action spans the eventful decade from the Spanish Civil War and New Deal, through WWII, to the McCarthy era, by which time Katie and Hubbell have moved from New York to Hollywood, where he is a screenwriter. Though melodramatic and sketchy, the political dimension of the story should not be underestimated; this is one of the very rare American movies in which a communist is treated sympathetically. Presumably much of this side of the scenario stemmed from the personal experience of writer Arthur Laurents, who was the same age as his protagonists, and who had McCarthy-related problems.Both stars are perfect for their roles; we can see what they see in each other; and we desperately want it to work for them, though we know it won't! Notable in support are Bradford Dillman, Lois Chiles, and James Woods. The theme song, emotionally delivered by Streisand as only she can, is beautiful, but the relevance of its nostalgic lyric to this clear-eyed movie is doubtful.  "}{"Title":"STREISAND AND REDFORD !

Writer Arthur Luarents' based his screenplay (and subsequent novel) on girl he knew in college, who fought for liberal (and sometimes communist) causes. Three decades after it's release, THE WAY WE WERE remains one of the few cinematic depictions of the Red Scare that swept America in the forties and fifties; the backdrop of which lends the surrounding love story greater potency and depth. The film was a surprise box office smash when originally released, and became the fifth-highest grossing film of 1973 and was instantly embraced as a classic.Katie Morosky is a character that Barbra Streisand born play, and she delivers on all accounts. Fierce and determined, yet vulnerable and self-conscious, Katie is a tricky character and Streisand inhabits her so deeply that she seems nothing less than completely believable. Justifiably nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, she inexplicably lost to Glenda Jackson's shrill performance in the barely remembered A TOUCH OF CLASS. This was clearly a major blunder on the side of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Robert Redford, who had actually turned down the role twice before director and friend Sydney Pollack talked him into taking the part, displays some of the best reflective acting ever seen on the big screen and effectively brings forth the dark side of being stereotyped as the All-American golden boy (although Redford did not receive an Oscar nod for playing Hubbell in this film, he was nominated for Best Actor that same year for his light comedic performance in THE STING).THE WAY WE WERE is different from most romances in that it is not death, feuding families, or any other societal phenomena that directly tear the couple apart. Katie and Hubbell are simply passionate individuals with highly volatile, and contrasting, ideologies; the conflict of which is expressed in several brilliantly written and acted scenes that shimmer with the type of intelligence and honesty that is rarely seen in cinema today. The film's enduring popular success with the mass audience may very well be due to the magnetic chemistry between Streisand and Redford, the gorgeous cinematography, and the strong directorial hand supplied by Pollack. However, it is the complexity of the romance with politics and the strong characterizations by both leads that continues to make THE WAY WE WERE the best love story for adults.

Sometimes you see two people together and think, they have nothing in common, or they are an odd couple. I feel Katie and Hubbell were attracted to each other, because they each had something the other lacked and wished they had inside of themselves.Katie and Hubbell were able to speak to each other honestly, brutally about the other's flaws. I think they came together to form a complete being, and that is why they married. Yet, this film also informs the audience you can't change your core beliefs, even for the sake of love. Eventually what brings them together, drives them apart.Redford's performance is often criticized in the film for not being emotional enough. If things always come easy to a person, there really isn't a need to make much noise, when you have access to all of your dreams. Redford's character knows he has deficiencies and that he is taking the easy way out. Hubbell is really a cynic at heart, but a shrewd cynic, because he tells Katie in one scene, that after the witch hunt is over, no one will care who was red or not, because people will just want to work, to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. Hubbell seems to know his time with Katie is limited, he knows they won't work out at tries to break it off, but can't. Hubbell also realizes Katies doesn't want the easy Hubbell and demands the real Hubbell make himself present in their relationship and in his professional life. At the end of the movie, people mention they don't like Hubbell, because he didn't have contact with his daughter, failed himself personally, but remains a professional success. Maybe Hubbell felt his daughter would be better off without him, or maybe having contact with his daughter meant he would always have to see Katie and he didn't want to be reminded of losing the love of his life. Maybe Hubbell felt constricted by the demands of love, realized this about himself and didn't want to expose a child to his defect. Yet, the final scene saves Hubbell for me, because when he walks across the street to speak with Katie and admits he can't come over for dinner and is pained to know his daughter has a good father. It was like he was never really a part of Katie's life. Hubbell and Katie were a movie about star crossed lovers that ran its course. The look on Redford's face is priceless.So all in all, Redford's understated performance, (with just enough outrage over Katie's antics in key moments) was just the right balance to Striesand's fire breathing Katie. In another actor's hand Hubbell's character would have tried to match fire with fire and that wouldn't have worked. You believe Hubbell has the strength to stand up to Katie and try to love her.As for Streisand, she walked a fine line between being a strong woman and being a fool for love. She knows she is all wrong for Hubbell and that she is stronger than Hubbell, but feels he could be a better person with her, and the right partner for her if, he would make the effort. She is going to mold Hubbell into the person she and he would like to be, but always forgets he is a human being with flaws. On paper, in person, he is too good to be true and is prince charming. The ballroom scene where Hubbell cuts through a crowd of people and dances with Katie is something from a fairy tale. Katie's yearning for someone from a fairy tale is interesting, because deep down she yearns for a knight in shining armor. Though the world around her tells her Hubbell is unobtainable, because he is a WASP, she is Jewish and not a blond bombshell, he seems to come from money, she's working class. Katie hates herself for being attracted to Hubbell, but can't help it. Striesand annoys you at times, but makes you root for her Katie. And why shouldn't she have prince charming? Striesand pulls out all the stops as a woman of passion and intellect, who shows her vulnerability through her love of Hubbell and tries to bring him up to her level in the area of personal responsibility to others and to oneself.Visually, Striesand is stunning in the glamorous 40's outfits and Redford is ready for Hollywood. It was interesting to see Katie transformed into a glamorous, almost carefree person in California, and that was because she was on Hubbell's turf. Back in New York, she goes back to her naturally curly hair, and you know she is back where she belongs, ready to save the world.The end of the movie is heartbreaking and yes, though everyone else has typed about it, you have to the love the hair brushing gesture Katie gives Hubbell and the warm embrace that shows there is still something between them, which was too much for them both to bear. I cry every time.

While it has some points in its favour, I found the writing and acting of not quite the highest standard leaving a sense of unfulfilment by the end.Hollywood in the 70's was at last ready to confront openly its own shame at its treatment of left-leaning actors writers and directors (The Front starring Woody Allen was soon to follow) and The Way We Were must have been something of a trailblazer in that respect which is certainly to its credit. Furthermore it's laudable to present the viewer with a deeper than usual love-story against this background, with many of the conversations of the leads debating interesting points on artistic integrity, political correctness and the shallowness of much of the general public's response to freedom-challenging issues of the day. In the end though I got the sense that director Pollack was more interested in the love story angle than the political angle (perhaps with an eye on the box-office) and this throws the film off-kilter.Streisand gets the showiest part (and, interestingly, her name in front of Redford's over the titles) and is mostly good. She's usually better when she says least (for example when Redford crudely and drunkenly makes her at her apartment) although her motor-mouth delivery obviously helps with her character's verbosity. More than once, though, you can see her acting and obviously hoping that Oscar was watching (he obviously wasn't). Redford is altogether more natural in his part as the handsome hunk with something approaching a brain but who ultimately can't accept Streisand's at times over-strident political philosophising. However one's sympathy for his character was dissipated by his turning love-rat on a now-pregnant Streisand and then abandoning her and their child almost the minute the child is born. Both these actions are loathsome in the extreme (not to mention an offensive homophobic remark he makes at another juncture) and by the time he's walking out on her for the last time at the conclusion (having also now sold-out the writing talent which Streisand alone had encouraged), you realise you've been watching a woman's film after all with the dice loaded in favour of Streisand's character. I was disappointed with this revelation as to Redford's character's true colours and felt it inconsistent with much of what had gone before.The film was obviously on a two-header basis which doesn't leave much room for the supporting actors to shine although Brad Dillman and Lois Chiles do okay with what they're given. Director Pollack keeps the narrative moving although some of the settings and costumery employed looked at times too contemporary. I'm also bound to state that I never got the impression that either lead was ageing down the years.As for the music score, while Marvin Hamlisch's title song is pretty and has obviously become a standard, I felt its strains were just too intrusive throughout and felt it should have been left a titles-only piece.A film then, at once ambitious and conservative, political and soporific, lush but talky - in the end I found it didn't enmesh these contradictions sufficiently well and missed its marks accordingly.

As Katie, a woman more or less equally in love with Robert Redford and her own social consciousness, Streisand looks good and is sometimes affecting, but neither she nor Redford are convincingly collegiate in their early scenes, and in the latter scenes that awkwardly and simplistically deal with the McCarthy era, both characters and their arguments become wearying. Neither the actors nor the details are persuasively period. And Redford is awful; his charm is studied, and he looks at Streisand with incredulity. Besides, his character is a dull, glib, deadbeat who seems to have majored in hairspray. Sydney Pollack who directed Tootsie and They Shoot Horses, Don't They? has done nothing to offset the film's inherent triteness, indeed he revels in clichés!

The story is basically a weepy melodrama, but who cares? Both of these superstars are the reason to watch. At first, we cannot imagine what they see in one another. They meet in college, circa 1937 -- Katie (Streisand) is a wallflower political activist, Hubble (Redford) is the Golden Boy track star. Yes, both were too old to play college students, so it is obvious the director surrounded them with people their own age, with some decent supporting actors like Lois Chiles and a younger James Woods. The two are reunited by World War II, Redford is in the military but also part of the uppity Beekman Street crowd, Streisand is a liberal who is nuts about FDR and working on various political causes. The unlikely twosome fall in love, get married, and do not always have an easy time. Redford doesn't mind his wife's political activity, but he is bored by politics and cannot relate to them. The turbulent 1950's hit, Redford is a writer in Red Scare Hollywood who takes the easy way out; Streisand believes people should always stand up for their principles, no matter the cost. Sydney Pollack directed this fine film, and had to convince his friend Redford to take on the part of Hubble Gardner; Redford was reluctant, and it is easy to see why. His character, while a decent guy at heart, is also shallow, somewhat superficial, and doesn't take life seriously. The film obviously exploits Redford's golden boy looks, something he always detested. Streisand's part is obviously the more interesting one, as the part was exclusively written for her. And while her character may not fit in on Beekman Street, she looks fabulous here. All in all, this is one of the finest romances to come out of the 1970's that also has intelligence and class.

That's a piece of wisdom that Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford should have remembered for their characters in The Way We Were.Meet Hubbell Gardiner and Katie Marofsky from the Thirties at Columbia University. Redford as Gardiner is your all American athlete and the Prince Charming of many a young girl's dreams. An elegant WASP Ivy League future is in store for him if he wants it. One of those girls who thinks Redford is Prince Charming is Barbra Streisand as Katie Marofsky. She's a member of the young Communists and is one eloquent campus radical for her cause. When we see her she's got a picture of Lenin in her dormitory room. We see her talking about the cause of Republican Spain and the budding young Ivy League Republicans on the campus are hooting her down. All, but Redford who's impressed by her convictions even if he doesn't share them.But when the USA does get into World War II and Redford is in the Navy and Streisand now working for the Office of War Information now meet. Politics seem to take a back seat to romance and Streisand lives out a real life fairy tale as a Brooklyn Jewish Cinderella.Their love gets really tested in the post World War II period during the Red Scare. Streisand's not quite the Communist she once was, a picture of FDR is now in her room. That was in fact one of FDR's main contributions to our body politic, winning over budding revolutionaries like Streisand to support our democratic, (big and small D) way of life. But he's gone now and the Soviet Union has become our cold war enemy. A lot of people are now caught in the post war reaction.Because Hollywood is the glamor capital of the world and right-wing politicos can't get any mileage out of investigating Communist plumbers, it's to the movie capital that the House Un-American Activities Committee turns. Redford is now working in that industry as is Streisand. Redford sees the problem in personal terms, Streisand sees the big picture, but that's all she does see. How things resolve themselves is the basis of The Way We Were.With all the political differences there beats the heart of one of the best love stories ever done in Hollywood. When Redford's around, Streisand lights up the screen with her passion for him. But it never quite covers the different world views they have.With such detail given to the stars by director Sydney Pollack, the supporting cast and it's a good one, never really establish their characters. Maybe that's what he wanted, to have them appear as plastic as Streisand's Katie Marofsky thinks they are.The Way We Were contains the title song written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bregman which became one of Streisand's best loved ballads. Her singing of that song is unforgettable whether heard on record or if fortunate, live at one of her concerts. Bing Crosby also made a nice recording of it for one of his last albums. Hamlisch also won an Oscar for Best overall Musical Score that year, they were the only two Oscars won by The Way We Were.The sad thing about The Way We Were is that Streisand and Redford hold such different views and yet are fundamentally decent people who cannot agree to disagree. It's what makes The Way We Were such a beautiful, yet ultimately sad film.

I, like many others, thought it was great, and loved Streisand and Redford and the theme song. I recently saw TWWW again, nearly 40 years later, and my opinion has changed dramatically. I cannot deny that Redford and Streisand definitely seem to have some kind of chemistry. And, as I felt the first time, Barbra represented every ugly duckling, gay or straight, who somehow manages to capture the prize. Via Barbra's performance, we can easily imagine what it must have been like to lie down with a prince. This, I think, may be one reason why the film had a certain level of success. Barbra also had moments where she spoke the truth with passion and intensity. I think people related to this outspokenness, this gutsiness, this willingness to take chances and not apologize for one's opinions. Barbra was also the outsider -- she was the smart Jewish girl who knew she had to work harder, study more, and fight for what she wanted, because nothing would come to her easily. It is for these reasons why I think the movie resonated. But the reality is The movie is not about anything, not really. What, exactly, is the plot? They meet in school, they meet years later, they fall in love, they get married, he has an affair, they divorce, they meet again... okay, so what? Barbra, who does have tons of talent, but in this film looked like she was performing her graduate project for Acting 101, spends a lot of time arguing and getting upset about things. But whatever those things are seem to be only tangentially connected/related to the rest of the story (if you can call it that). Bob, yes, stunning to look at, coasts through the film with little to do or say. He didn't want to do the film, and I can see why. Yeah, he looks great, but what is the emotional arc of his character? A lot was cut from this film and as a result, it seems disjointed. There is an inordinate amount of time spent on Bob's career as a screenwriter in Hollywood while a pregnant Barbra tends to their little beach house. And yet everyone seems miserable and unhappy. Voices were raised, but nothing really happens. Near the end when Barbra has apparently given birth to their child (after it's clear that their relationship is over), Bob shows up at the hospital. Barbra is perfectly coiffed and made-up as if she's just come back from a spa. He stands there, emotionless, ready to abandon her and their newborn child. We're supposed to like him? I couldn't stand him. In fact, James Wood, who we meet early on in the film, who seems to be Barbra's quasi-boyfriend in college and who seems to support everything she was trying to do, is clearly a better man for her--but he wasn't as handsome. Life is cruel, isn't it? Finally, the theme song Yes, it is a beautiful song for what it is and Barbra sings it beautifully. Who knew that it would become an iconic song and help define her career? She didn't even want to sing the song--she felt it was too simple. She had to be talked into it. So, finally, in the end, what are we left with? A unique opportunity to see Barbra and Bob dressing in period costumes, lots of bad, bad lighting, a plot-less rambling story that does not stay any one place long enough for us to care about much of anything, lots of intense arguing and challenging others from Barbra, and lots of stoic looks from Bob. And yet, it was a big hit. Like I said at the beginning, it was Barbra's ugly duckling status and landing the prince that I think resonated with a large part of the audience. At least it did with me... back then. At this point in time, I just kind of stared at it in amazement and said, What exactly is this all about?

After not seeing it for a very long time I sat down last night and played it. I can gladly say that the film has aged very well and is every bit as solid and moving as when I first saw it. Barbara is as beautiful as she ever was in any film. Redford made legions of ladies swoon with his natural, rugged, non-tampered handsome blondness.The story is quite believable and borrows from the historical record that it is placed in. There were lots of Jewish people who got caught up in the anti-Fascist, anti-war and anti-bomb movements. But the actual beliefs or disinterested lifestyles, although well articulated in the film are secondary throughout, helping to craft the tensions that underscore the real theme romantic but inevitably doomed love.Streisand and Redford threw themselves into this work and their on screen chemistry is wonderful. Barbara's singing of the theme music pulls at the heart strings as it is meant to. This is a beautiful and adult drama that reminds anyone who has lived through disappointment and heartbreak in love what it was all about. One of the best films for both actors. For me only Yentl eclipses Barbara's success on screen. Watch for a very young James Woods early in the film. Keep the Kleenex box close by. Still one of my favourites.

Set in 1930's America at the start of the movie, Morosky is a politically active communist on campus, who hands out flyers and speaks at anti-war rallies. The man who will become her love interest is Hubbell Gardiner, played by Robert Redford. Gardiner is more a part of the elite than Morosky and is not politically active at all...he's more hedonistic, hence their being a potential odd couple.For this early part of the movie, you have to suspend disbelief over how much older Streisand and Redford seem in relation to the characters they play. In other words, they look too old for their parts. However, Redford gives a completely winning performance early in the piece as an undergraduate student. He is all easy charm, manners, and engagingly amusing to boot...in contrast to oh so serious Morosky.Now, not being versed in the history of this production, it does come across as Streisand pulling all of the strings. She is not a conventional leading lady, and her pairing with Redford would not seem an obvious choice. To me, their early attraction was glossed over, which made Morosky seem a little bit creepy when she does get into bed with Gardiner for the first time! So, if Streisand did pull a lot of strings to make this movie, it perhaps represents some 'wish fulfilment' on her part! And, as if to explain her presence in this film, Morosky does say some things which seem to have psychoanalytical weight for Streisand's own situation (i.e. Morosky's views on her looks, which may engage the audience member wondering why Streisand is paired with Redford).The undergraduate Morosky may seem a tad annoying early on, but the more mature Morosky does engage more...not being so militant, and ridding herself of that overgrown mop of hair on her head which didn't sit right with me. It's then that it becomes more understandable why Gardiner would be attracted to her.Theirs is an intriguing relationship, especially in how Morosky deals with Gardiner's friends, who are more like him than her. During the period that they are in university together (or maybe it's called 'college' in the US), attention is paid to Gardiner's writing ability. It is this part of the story that will later have a life of its own in the movie. Initially this branch of the story seemed quite odd...why focus on this if this is meant to be a love story? Things become clearer later on, as the historical context of the film's setting becomes clearer. This historical context may prove to be an eye-opener for Americans who are Generation X or Generation Y.When I jotted down notes on this film, I wrote The ending is sort of established, so, like the start, you wonder about the specifics. Hmmm, not sure what I meant by that!Anyway, I give this film 65/100. Intriguing, and Redford shows his star qualities here-the Brad Pitt of his day.

Back in this present time, 20 years later, they reconnect quite quickly. The only problem they have is their political opinions, and Katie pushing Hubbell to write another book. It may have lasted a good long while, but eventually their differences separate them again, and in the end they meet again, moved on and saying what is essentially goodbye (for good).

Not only that, the soundtrack is fabulous and The Way We Were sung of course, by Streisand, is both haunting and beautiful.The Way We Were is not only a cinematic masterpiece, but probably one of the most honest films ever created about love. Katie and Hubbel are so in love, yet so different and unwilling to change their own values and priorities, it just won't work. This is honest.

Streisand plays Katie Morosky, a university student and vocal leader of the Young Communists. She is drawn to the strikingly handsome, athletic and intelligent Hubbell Gardner (Redford), whose glibness and All American good looks anger and attract Katie, while also masking his apparently fine writing talents. One must say 'apparently', as we are never given any indications of what makes him such a fine writer. In fact, we are given little indication of what makes him a worthy object of the much more interesting, active and intelligent Katie's desire. If her attraction is simply to his Hellenic beauty, this seriously undercuts the great romance the filmmakers have attempted to construct.The story is an insightful examination of the conflicting political ideas of its two leads, matching Katie the red against Hubbell the conventionalist, their exchanges explode with tension. The blandness of Hubbell's ideas leaves one with sympathy for Katie, as he looks dull she looks vibrant and exudes fire and verve. Further, against Redford's mannered performance, Streisand looks in command, her face reflecting the inner turmoil she is feeling. It's not hard to fathom why their coupling is considered one of film's great pairings. They look as natural together as Gable and Lombard.Lastly, kudos to the ubiquitous Academy Award-winning theme. Layered over every scene of even the slightest emotional importance, this has to be one of the most gorgeous themes in film's history. Lovers and romantics, be forewarned.

Redford is an all-American W.A.S.P. who is a golden boy with the right charisma and charm. Streisand is an activist left winger, trying to get the student population to stand up and think for themselves (while she tends to overlook her own inability to think clearly at the start of the film she is lauding Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union for being the only ones supporting the Loyalist regime in Spain against the Fascist Franco). On the campus they never quite clicked, although Redford did show a friendly interest in kkkKatie the Commie while Streisand certainly loved looking at Redford. Redford has talent (writing a brilliant short story in the creative writing course he and Streisand attend), and later publishing other short stories, and finally a novel. Streisand reads his novel and wants to bring out his creative muse. The problem is that Redford is not as intense as Streisand on anything. He is hesitant about further novels, and he certainly is more easy going about the reality of politics. When FDR dies Streisand is in deep mourning (she thought of the President as a demigod). But Redford and his friends like J.J. (Bradford Dillman) see the reality that frequently undercuts whatever good politicians try to accomplish. Streisand gets furious at various jokes at the expense of FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt that Redford and Dillman's friends tell, not realizing that the jokes are to relieve the tension and sadness of the moment.It keeps going on like this, causing the relationship to falter, and then be rebuilt again and again. The crisis comes in Hollywood. Redford has written eight chapters of a second book, but he willingly shelves his book to concentrate on a career as a screenplay writer, working on a movie of his novel directed by George Bissinger (Patrick O'Neill). Bissinger is a liberal, and his friends include left of center types (Vivica Lindfors, Murray Hamilton), but he is a realist about what to avoid in the growing Cold War paranoia in the U.S. Both Dillman and Redford see this too. But Streisand sees only the threat to the Bill of Rights, and becomes a vocal opponent to H.U.A.C. She goes to Washington to support the Hollywood Ten writers who were blacklisted, and Redford comes to take her home. Their confrontation in an empty train station room is the point where the marriage crumbles.The Way We Were was up for several Oscars in 1973, but only won one Oscar for it's haunting and lovely theme song by Marvin Hamlisch. It has since become one of the songs (like Julie Styne's Don't Rain On My Parade) that are associated with Streisand, as she sang both. But it has much more going for it, including it's screenplay by Arthur Laurents and the performances in general (including supporting parts by Lois Chiles, Herb Edelman, George Gaynes, and a young James Woods). The film also was well directed by Sydney Pollack, the second of seven films Pollack did with Redford as the star. It has now become a kind of cultural icon of its own, being referred to on programs like Sex and the City, The Gilmore Girls, and even (in a funny stretch) The Nanny. Although Pollack's Oscar was for Out of Africa, and his best liked film was possibly Tootsie, I think that in the long run it will be The Way We Were which will be Pollack's best remembered film.Therefore, I dedicate this review to the memory of Sydney Pollack, who died of cancer last week.

That much is apparent from the title and poster itself. The problem is not this setup so much as what happens in between, which is essentially nothing. Having understood the title and bringing in our knowledge of the history of romantic drama's inclination to force a wedge between its main characters, our only hope is to wait for the falling out moment and go from there. Again, none of this would be a problem had their been a more compelling story and situations to hold the audience's attention throughout the film. Unfortunately, that is not the case here.The sad part is, the acting is good enough to create a very tense and emotional setting. Barbra Streisand as the incredibly leftist political advocate and Robert Redford as the golden boy who gets by on a whim are both quite effective and have good chemistry together. Streisand got all the attention at the time mostly due to her extreme beauty and sparkling screen presence, yet Redford is remarkably subdued in this film and to great effect. His performance is much less noticeable than the melodramatic flairs of Streisand, yet he is the steady rock on which this romance rests upon. What this film lacks most of all is true emotion, a gripping scene or some kind of moment in which the audience is truly hooked and completely enveloped with these characters. Never for a moment are Katie or Hubbell ever so interesting as to invest two hours of our lives into theirs. That being said, this is not a bad film, just not a good one. Director Sydney Pollack maintains a steady hand in showcasing the rise of the romance and its decline, yet there seems to be a few scenes missing that needed to be included to help better understand the situation as a whole. I suppose the film is supposed to be read as a critique on extreme politicking and the turbulent times in which these characters live. Yet, the huge international and national events occurring seem to be nothing more than fodder in which to install these people. Neither are they so interesting as to capture the attention of people for a significant amount of time. Both are quite selfish and misguided and in the end come off as rather unlikable and aloof. Perhaps the only lesson to be taken from this is that politics are a volatile element in any relationship and serve little in the way of support and togetherness.

The movie talked about a point that is rarely dealt with in romantic stories specially the new ones that stray away a lot from reality. The point is when two are in love but have different perspectives to life. It's truly a major issue in any relationship and was honestly dealt with in this movie because in the beginning when the passion is too strong both parties show the willingness to compromise but later when life takes over and time starts slowly killing this passion, both can tolerate the difference no more! I loved so much the final scene when he sees her in the street and goes to say hi. She invites him to the house to see his own daughter but he refuses to saying You know I can't!. Waw! It means he is still in love with her because when a love that is too strong passes by you once, you know you will not forget it but you know that you can bury it alive! Both actors Redford and Streisand were amazing in their roles and couldn't have though of somebody else replacing them. The roles were truly made for them.

When they first meet in college, Katie is an outspoken Jewish, liberal (no, Communist) activist, working hard to put herself through school. Hubbell is a wealthy, conservative, golden boy WASP, more interested in sports than in causes. When they meet up again some years later, they have a romance that leads to pregnancy, get married, and move to California. However, by now it's getting into a politically volatile era where people are being blacklisted as Communist sympathizers, and their ideological differences cause problems...This movie is for me, memorable mainly for the amazing on screen chemistry between its two very adept stars, Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford (perfect in their roles here), the immortal tearjerker ending, and the song The Way We Were.Reading the commentary, I somewhat agree with other reviewers that, even though Katie has remarried, the idea of Hubbell abandoning his daughter, of having no contact with her whatsoever, is not very endearing. However, times were different during that era, and custody or visitation back and forth between New York (Katie) and California (Hubbell) would have proved difficult and unusual. Truthfully, the kindest thing he may have done for his daughter, assuming Katie's current husband to be a loving and decent man, is exactly what he did...stay completely out of the picture and let his daughter have one consistent male parent, the step father. So, while Hubbell on the surface appears selfish and negligent in his parental responsibilities...This film is a classic romance from my college years, and as such I remember it fondly. It's a testament to a quotation I once heard to the effect that a happy marriage does not depend upon the two people looking at each other, but in them both looking outward in the same direction. I guess we have a demonstration of this here with the apparently insurmountable obstacles faced by Katie and Hubbell.

Katie (Streisand) is the nice Jewish Girl who neither drinks or smokes and whose passion is politics. She is bright as a new penny and has an opinion about everything. Hubbell (Redford) is a handsome shallow Waspy guy for whom everything comes easy. Unlike Katie who has to work hard for everything she achieves. She has a crush on him in college in the late 30's but the romance doesn't begin until she runs into him in a nightclub during World War 2. She instinctively understands that the differences between them cannot be surmounted. However, he is another cause to her and she is determined to bed him. Which she does while he is too drunk to know that it even happened. I have never seen a scene like this before or since in any movie.As the relationship continues it becomes obvious that it is because she wills it to work. I think he is fascinated that in his world where people lack passion and are vaguely bored that here is this fierce woman pursuing him. (The book was written by Arthur Laurents who met just such a woman during his college years.) Hubbell is amused at his power to intrigue Katie and basks in the glow of her powerful attraction. When I first saw this movie I kept thinking Katie you won the prize now just keep your mouth shut and enjoy it. But as I get older I believe that she was the one who would ultimately end up the winner because she wanted so much. At one point he says to her Katie give up already. So you have to wonder if he would have stayed married to her if she had not said enough.True to his passivity even at the end of the movie he leaves her to raise their child which he has no desire to see. Whether its because he can't bear to see Katie now married to David X. Cohen or whether it is that now that Katie is not interested in him he will not take responsibility for his child--one is left to wonder. He will never find someone who loves him the way Katie does and there is that sad recognition on his face in the last scene.There has been talk over the years of a sequel.

Katie is an idealistic, uptight, Stalin-loving political activist. Hubbell is an easy- going, athletic, All American-type, and a talented writer. We see their different personalities affect their relationship and how they manage despite the differences...Pretty much your stereotypical romantic drama, but with added dullness and schmaltz. So long-winded and pointless.There is potential for profound statement, especially when we run into the McCarthy witch-hunts, but this is handled so heavy-handedly that the movie defeats its own purposes.Elevating the nausea is Barbara Streisand, and her character, Katie. One of the most irritating characters in cinematic history. The fact that Hubbell sticks with her despite her personality being so off-putting harms any credibility the relationship had.Robert Redford puts in a solid performance as Hubbell, and his presence probably gives us a clue to why this movie is so highly rated.

Given the title (and absolutely beautiful title song), nostalgia is one of the film's major themes. Yet nostalgia isn't approached from a purely idealistic standpoint either, as a third-act line from Hubbell (Robert Redford) indicates (Katie, it was never uncomplicated). The film, to a degree, is about how politics can be divisive, particularly in personal relationships, but also in one's professional life, as part of the story takes place against the backdrop of McCarthyism and the Blacklist in Hollywood. I found the whole thing to be extremely well-written and balanced, with Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford's characters each making valid points about devotion to causes, perception vs reality, and relationships. I haven't seen a lot of movies with either person, but both of them were in very good form here. And, the film had a very strong three-act structure that brought out the central relationship's development that much more. On technical matters, I thought period detail was attended to very well, with each segment/act being distinct in terms of light, color, etc. Then, there's the title song. Barbra Streisand has a beautiful voice that fit Marvin Hamlisch's music to a tee; and, the music itself did an excellent job of evoking a sense of nostalgia throughout the entire running time, appearing in various forms and instrumentation over the course of the film. It is without hesitation or reservation that I put this among one of my favorite films of all time. Everything about it just works, from the story, the acting, the music, etc. It's the kind of movie that will have you longing for the good old days, even if you never grew up during that time period.

When I recently sat down to watch The Way We Were for the second time (the first having been over ten years ago) I realised that Marvin Hamlisch's famous theme song was about the only thing I could remember about it. Of the film itself I only had misty water-coloured memories of a campus romance between a handsome, blond upper-class WASP boy and a working class girl, a sort of remake of Love Story except for the fact that the girl, who is Jewish rather than Italian Catholic (and a lot less attractive than Ali McGraw), doesn't die at the end. The scriptwriter Arthur Laurents in fact wrote the leading male role with Ryan O'Neal, the star of Love Story, in mind.The film opens in the late 1930s when Katie Morosky and Hubbell Gardiner first meet at university. The two do not seem to have much in common. She is a working-class Jewish Marxist and president of the college branch of the Young Communist League, whereas he is from a wealthy upper-class WASP background. (At least, everyone seems to assume that Hubbell is a WASP, although his Protestantism is never actually mentioned in the film. He could equally well be a White Anglo-Saxon Catholic or White Anglo-Saxon Atheist, but WASC and WASA do not work so well as acronyms). This, however, seems to be one case where opposites attract, and Hubbell and Katie fall in love. They are temporarily separated, but meet again after the war and marry. The film then follows the subsequent history of their marriage. Perhaps the reason so little about the film remains in the memory is because it is a misty water-coloured movie. By that I am not referring to its visual style; the photography is crisp and well-defined. There is, however, something vague and insubstantial about the plot. It doesn't help that both the leads are so unsympathetic. Hubbell is good- looking and charming, but shallow and superficial, unwilling to work hard at anything. When we first meet him he has ambitions to become a writer, and clearly has talent in that direction, but after publishing his first novel never has much success, preferring to work for easy money producing scripts for Hollywood and television. As for Katie, I find it very hard to sympathise with a strident and unapologetic defender of Stalin's regime, even though Laurents obviously intended us to find her sympathetic, politics and all. One of the causes of the growing estrangement between her and Hubbell is his dismissal of her political activism, but this is one area where I felt he showed more sense than she did. The film deals with McCarthyism, but in a classical piece of solipsism fails to acknowledge that the concerns of the House Un-American Activities Committee went much further than a few blacklisted Hollywood directors and screenwriters or that the great majority of McCarthy's victims had absolutely no connection with the motion picture industry. Nor does it explore the irony of Communists like Katie invoking the protection of the American Constitution they were sworn to destroy or ask why, if they were so concerned with freedom of speech, they did not demonstrate outside the Soviet embassy demanding that Stalin extend to his own subjects the freedoms they were claiming for themselves. Another problem with the film is that too much is taken for granted and not enough explained. It purports to be a study of a marriage, but important events in the story of that marriage are rather glossed over, such as Hubbell's affair with the ex-wife of a friend. The final scene shows Hubbell and Katie meeting again in the sixties, and it is clear that they are now divorced (and Katie re-married), but the actual divorce and what led up to it are never shown. We are left to conclude that the differences in their background and temperament have made it impossible for them to live together. (To be fair to Laurents, his original screenplay was very much altered to meet the studio's demands and various other writers were brought in to contribute, which possibly explains the plot's lack of coherence). Robert Redford's rather laid-back style of acting made him a natural choice for a laid-back character like Hubbell. Casting directors from this period often liked to pair Redford with a more intensely dramatic leading lady to emphasise the contrast between their characters. Sydney Pollack, who directs here, had already done this by casting Redford opposite Natalie Wood in This Property Is Condemned, as had Gene Saks (less successfully) with Jane Fonda in Barefoot in the Park. (Pollock was later to make the Redford/Fonda pairing work more effectively in The Electric Horseman). Certainly Barbra Streisand is at her most intense here, but she is faced with the impossible task of trying to make a Stalinist harridan into a likable human being, and we never really care about what happens to her character. On the positive side, Hamlisch's romantic and poetic musical score is a very fine one and Streisand gives a marvellous rendition of That Song. 6/10. (5/10 for the film itself, with a bonus point for the music; Hamlisch deservedly won Academy Awards for Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Original Song).

So I added it to my Netflix list of DVD's for delivery. The famous song that Hamlisch wrote with lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman with Barbra Streisand's vocals is here but in a different version than the one I heard on the radio over the years which had a more contemporary '70s vibe than the more orchestral version played here. Such a touching and memorable song that was and hearing it in the score quite frequently in the picture made the whole thing almost perfect. I said almost because, as many of you reading this probably know, director Sydney Pollack had cut a couple of pertinent scenes that, when I watched the accompanying short doc that was also on the disc that showed these sequences, made sense why things happened at the end when they did. I mean, watching the film without them made things a little confusing but still had a bittersweet romantic effect that still gave a somewhat touching climax due to the talents of Pollack, Streisand, Hamlisch, and especially leading man Robert Redford. The whole period from the late '30s to the '50s was so fascinating to look at and Arthur Laurents' screenplay was awash in dialogue that was to die for especially between Barbra and Robert. Really, all I'll say now is The Way We Were is still something worth seeing and thinking about afterwards... "},{"Title":"True to a certain bittersweet quality of life ...","Date":"16 October 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" At the dawn of the campus years, Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford) celebrates the first publication of one of his short stories; and Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) raises a toast to his first novel. Meanwhile, he asks her why she didn't take with humor one joke made after a political speech, all she needed was to laugh at a rather benign prank and she would have won the audience. But Katie has no sense of humor whatsoever when it comes to politics and Gardiner hardly believes he can make it as a novelist. Here we are with flawed characters trying to inculcate the very value that lacks in the other detachment and passion. And that kind of complementarity is the true basis of a realistic romance rather than a simple love at first sight or a hate-then-love formula, The Way We Were, directed by Sidney Pollack in 1973, is above all these clichés.The scene I just described encapsulates the whole relationship between the Jewish, passionate and activist Katie Morosky and the classy, WASP and handsome Hubbell Gardiner. She believes in his talent, he's amazed by her passion, she's a burning fire that ignited his heart, and he embodies a sort of perfection only her eyes can value and cherish, and the way she tenderly caresses his hair is more eloquent than any description. The acting from the two leads makes the chemistry so real, so believable, that I even failed to see how the couple could be seen as 'unlikely', although the attraction between opposites is what drives the whole narrative, if not the romance. Granted Barbra Streisand is not the most attractive actress (though she has marvelous eyes, and fingernails that would turn on any fetishist) the film is definitely not about a sort of 'Beauty and the Beast' syndrome.I'm certain of this assessment even more because it's Katie who steals the show, she's the one who orchestrates the whole relationship and plays like a true mentor to Gardiner. And Redford finds the right note to play a character apparently dull, but in fact, only lacking the necessary amount of confidence because everything went too easily for him. Gardiner is like the big and strong guy who was so physically impressive that he was never attacked and then could never develop self-defense mechanisms or brutality and could be dominated by smaller and weaker guys. Gardiner is blonde, good-looking, he's an accomplished athlete, and it was so easy for him to be popular that he didn't even need to build a character. He is a spineless guy and in contrast, Morosky dealt with adversity for so many years that, if not the 'Beast', she's the 'Ugly Duckling' who compensated through her courage, her ability to stand up for her ideals and transcended all her limitations.And what a character by the way, Barbra Streisand illuminates the screen with such an energy we can help but feel her enthusiasm and passion for Gardiner, but not without noticing how desperate it is. For she's the one who cares more for their relationships, and another aspect that confirms it is the whole political subtext that undermines the romance rather than accompany it. Gardiner and Morosky do complete each other but in the sense that one needs to be more passionate and gutsy, and the other more easy-going and cool, but the chemistry is always victim of political interferences. The film spans one decade but probably the richest of American history, it starts with the pre-War period when someone (Katie) could proclaim to be a Communist, to the War and it ends with the Cold War and first manifestations of McCarthysm, the era that would give a deathblow to their relationship. Yet the script isn't quite clear about the way the couple is threatened by the hearings, it widens the already existing gap between Gardiner and Morosky, as he believes that one shouldn't risk to lose everything for such abstractions as principles, people count more yet she believes that People are their principles. The film features a lot of suffering, of misunderstandings, of failed attempts to change the person we love, to elevate him or her and in its own unique way. The Way We Were is the chronicle of a doomed relationship, and Pollack doesn't invite us to take side for one character, as each one is responsible for the marital failure. To a certain extent, the script remains true to a bittersweet quality of life, it doesn't even feature an obligatory 'I love you' line for that matter, and it manages to create situations we all can respond to. But now that I found out some scenes were cut out to relieve the film from its political material, I can't help but blame Pollack for having followed his audience' initial reaction (the issues are covered in the DVD features), because what's left is even more puzzling since we don't know why they broke up. We could see the rupture coming, but what was the defining moment that put an end to everything, remains unknown. And the film is too mature to get away with the excuse of infidelity; Morosky could have closed her eyes on that. At the end, The Way We Were isn't a perfect film, but it's still satisfactory, as if it was trusting the viewers not to focus on its rather anticlimactic ending, and just understand that the two leads had 'their' reasons to break up, and no matter what happens, they'll forever be the most important person of their respective lives.The movie is not without some flaws especially on the editing department, but it's kind of redeemed by the performances, the directing, a dazzling cinematography, and what's more, the sweet nostalgia induced by Marvin Hamlish's score, less emphatic than Doctor Zhivago or dramatic than Love Story, it's tender enough to be listened to without distracting from the story.

Seconds later, MC Skat Kat begins the song by proudly proclaimingI'm MC Kat on the rap, so mic it Here's a little story and you're sure to like it Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool With my homegirl, Paula AbdulAbdul then spends the next three and a half minutes flirting, dancing, and having some good old-fashioned fun with the animated cat.Is there really much truth to the phrase opposites attract, or is it just a cliché that people use to try to justify idiotic people making irrational choices for shallow reasons? Hubbell Gardiner's(Redford) short-story begins with the line Like his country, things had come too easily to him. Katie Morosky(Streisand) later on tells Gardiner that the line in the story is true of his own life. Maybe that's it. Maybe opposites attract because people want a challenge, and to get the guy/girl who they shouldn't be with on paper, is what attracts a man/woman to his/her opposite. Who would want, or need, a challenge more than someone like Hubbell Gardiner All-American, popular, handsome college-athlete for whom things always came too easily.Hubbell's attraction to Katie (Jewish, ultra left-wing, political activist) can be rationalized, but what about Katie's attraction to Hubbell? Maybe Hubbell is right when he says's to Katie, When you love someone, from Roosevelt to me, you go deaf, dumb and blind. Maybe we shouldn't even bother to try to rationalize an emotion like love. See, the opposites attract idea is not strong enough to make me believe that MC Skat Kat would ever have a chance with Paula Abdul, and it's not strong enough to make me believe that these two characters, on paper, would even get into a conversation with each other, let alone have such a passionate romance.The romance, on paper and at moments in the film, seems a little forced. However, it does work. It's not a naively romantic movie. It's definitely realistic, and it does not use the opposites attract idea as a tool to turn the concept of love into a force stronger than it is, as if it can conquer every and anything. In fact, the movie shows how their differences, despite their undeniable love for each other, are what drive them apart and prevent from being with each other. The movie should be titled The Way We Were, Are, and Will Always Be because they are ultimately static characters. The two leads also have a significant amount of chemistry truly needed for this story to work.Streisand's performance, especially, is what makes this movie work. Streisand has always played the down-to-earth, very human, very warm, funny young girl, and we all love her for it. This role was a challenge because the character of Katie Morosky is such a strong, stubborn, idealist (which can be very admirable, up to a point) and only Streisand's charisma can keep the audience from not being as tortured by her personality as Redford's character is throughout the story.The main problem with the film is that the plot seems to just be a way to past the time until the two break-up.The plot goes one way then inexplicably abandons that path without any sort of resolution. The Hollywood Ten protests were used as a way to get these two to suddenly fall out of love. The pregnancy plot point amounted to nothing more than the film ending, pointlessly, with Hubbell being an unapologetic deadbeat dad and nothing being or implied about it.This is one of Streisand's best performances and she really makes this film. Even with its flaws, it's intellectually engaging enough to enjoy.

I was in my early teens then and i remember almost all the girls in my HS had photos of Redford from this movie.The guy became THE sex symbol of that time from this movie.There's the scene where Streisand sees Redford sitting at a barstool at ElMorocco,with his eyes closed and from the way of her expression the audience understands she is just knocked out by his looks.Which is really what this movie is all about.The audience sees Redford(its his face that is important not the character) through the eyes of Katie-Streisand and millions of girls and mature women identified with her and a new male sexsymbol was born.This type of blond boyish hero was not really anything Hollywood had before.The archtypical leading man had been Clark Gable,a dark masculine and dynamic man,while this Redford doll-type person was a new kind of feminine fantasy.On the other hand,Streisand-Katie was the dynamic,energetic and forceful woman,a kind of pre-feminist who wanted that blond boyish guy the way men like blond starlets.This movie created a stereotype for her too.So here the roles are really reversed,and this goes on in the entire movie,where Redfords character is really the more passive one and Streisands is the more forceful one.Its the reason Redford hated this character and didn't want to play it in the first place.But ironically,his image as a matinée idol was created mostly from this movie.So folks,this was it.Most people my age who had seen this movie when it came out don't even remember the story.They remember Redford and Streisand,and -OH-and THE SONG.

THE WAY WE WERE presents such a story. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, polar opposites in every way down to their physical features -- he's matinée idol pretty in a pre-Brad Pitt sort of way; she's just uncomfortable to look at and is a much better singer (when she's not acting) -- recreate the drawn-out story of a romance gone slowly bad due to the progressive views they both share.I don't know if it's the lead actors. I personally don't admire Babs all that much but I will say that she does carry much of the dramatic weight of the story and thus fulfils her part. (If only more attention to detail had existed to period, because the hair Babs has to sport if purely Seventies and almost distracting.) Redford, however, is a completely different story. Time has proved he's become a much better director. As an actor, all he does for the most of the film is react to Babs in a completely thankless manner so for me it wasn't that they broke up, but when it would happen. The entire film is one well-written inconclusive attempt to bring the old glamour back. Far from bad, just not all that believable where it should be.

Hubbard and Katie are as different as can be imagined. In personality, temperament, politics, sense of humour, etc., these two are polar opposites and are never truly comfortable with each other, yet are constantly drawn together by a love that neither of them really understands. It seems that there should be more than enough dramatic tension here to keep a movie going for 2 hours, but somehow the screenplay by Arthur Laurents just didn't manage any sustained flow. I would describe this as a piece of fluffy nothingness. It isn't unpleasant and there's nothing in it to offend. It's just that there really isn't all that much in it that's interesting, either. If it hadn't been for the fact that it gave us the wonderful title song sung by Barbra Streisand, I suspect this movie would have been rather quickly forgotten.I can't go any better than 4/10 on this one.

Katie and Hubbell meet in college and she is immediately smitten with him, though she tries to fight it. Hubbell admires Katie's spirit, though he doesn't really love her, and from this springs one of the most moving and beautiful love stories ever put on celluloid, ending during the early 1960's.This movie draws you in immediately because Katie and Hubbell are both people that we can relate to and we understand their feelings for each other from the beginning and even though these people are polar opposites, we want to see them make this relationship work, which is further complicated by their conflicting political convictions. Katie is all about making a difference in the world and Hubbell wants to take things as they come and not quite as seriously as Katie does.The on screen chemistry between Streisand and Redford is off the charts and Streisand had to fight hard to get Redford to do the film. He rejected the role after reading the original script and Streisand had re-writes done immediately in order to beef up Hubbell's role.Pollack's sensitive direction and effective support from Bradford Dillman, Patrick O'Neal, and Viveca Lindfors also deserve mention here, but it is the magic chemistry generated by Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford that made this movie the instant classic it became. Needless to say, the classic Oscar winning theme song, flawlessly performed by Streisand, didn't hurt.

Over thirty years have elapsed since its initial release, and it's easy to forget what a massive challenge director Sydney Pollack had in making this movie. Primarily he had to harness the elephantine personality of Barbra Streisand, then the most powerful female movie star, within a period movie that was designed to provide an incisive look at the McCarthy-era witch hunts. Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances, still her best on screen work. She was also lucky to have veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents write such a strong, multi-dimensional character in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinée idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling.In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. I particularly like the intimate café scene where Hubbell announces to Katie that his article has just been published and later on when she cajoles him to stay for dinner and rattles on in typical Streisand rat-a-tat fashion about how she spent all her ration stamps on steaks and baked potatoes. Her look of realized humiliation afterward is priceless. She also handles her showcase scenes well, for instance, at the radio station when Hubbell concedes that the relationship is impossible to continue and later when Katie begs Hubbell to come over to help her sleep. I realize I was being manipulated by only-in-Hollywood, Oscar-baiting gesticulations, but the scenes somehow work regardless.When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles. But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, The Way We Were A Look Back. I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures.Despite its narrative disconnect in the last third, I still love this movie, and it does deserve its place among the great screen romances. The evocative music along with the overplayed title tune certainly adds to its impact. It's just that it doesn't belong in a sub-category of films that deal seriously with the Communist red scare. The DVD transfer is good though not exceptional, and for die-hard fans of the movie, the well-done documentary seems essential.

I just read one of the user comments making all kinds of snotty remarks about Barbra and I don't want to hear any more. In case you haven't guessed, I'm a left-winger and proud of it. My favorite scene is Robert Redford kicking on some loudmouth's ass for calling Babs a commie bitch. I hate missing it when it first came out, but in 1973 I wrote it off as just some chick flick, even though I've always been a fan of Babs and Redford. Their chemistry's fabulous in this love story of two young people in my parents' generation set against the backdrop of late 1930s to early 1950s America. My mother, who also went to college in the late 1930s, said, Back then, all the best people on campus were communists. Babs has the stronger character. Left-wing Jewish activist Katie is so wrapped up in her political causes she doesn't know how to handle love, or to laugh, as Redford's apolitical Hubbell points out.Hubbell, as an aspiring screenwriter, gets Katie riled because he and his slightly more conservative friends think everything's a joke. Great scene Katie goes into a tailspin when one of them cracks a tactless joke about Franklin D. Roosevelt upon hearing of the president's death. The whole story follows the couple as they try to change their ways to make the relationship work. It has its boring moments, but the film works as a whole. Those users who dissed it can say what they please. It was also amazing seeing a young James Woods as one of Katie's activist college friends. But one of the few gripes I have is What happened to that guy? Also, while you can't beat the theme song by the golden-throated Babs (It's great that it made the AFI's Top 10 list of all-time movie songs), the movie beats it to death by playing it too much and too intrusively. As a naive college student I was wrong about this film.

Okay, let me qualify that; I mean in the sense of an Original Screenplay written directly for the screen as opposed to an Adaptation from another medium (for example the year after this film was released Redford starred in an unsuccessful film adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's novella The Great Gatsby with a budget probably five times greater than The Way We Were and light years inferior to the 1949 Alan Ladd version which in comparative terms was made for a stick of gum), a movie that is character driven and plot driven as opposed to cgi driven, a big budget movie in which all the Above The Line personnel - Writer, Actors, Director, Composer/Lyricist(s) - are all A-List as opposed to an Indie with few if any A-Listers involved. It may work so well because we've seen elements before - it's quite possible that Noel Coward, for instance, was the first writer to set a story spanning several decades against a backcloth of international events that serve as shorthand to link the passage of time; he did it first in Cavalcade and again in This Happy Breed but Arthur Laurents borrows it to great effect in a plot that is punctuated by, among other things, The Spanish Civil War, The death of FDR, the witch-hunts overseen by HUAC and the Ban The Bomb campaign. Then there's the radio element long familiar to admirers of Irwin Shaw (who began by writing for radio in the thirties) via his brilliant - and unjustly neglected novel The Troubled Air. Then, of course there's the bittersweet love story that's been with us since the cradle and this one takes one of the greatest, Brief Encounter, and puts spin on it.

This romance between firebrand Katie and placid but talented Hubbell perfectly reflected the passion of that time. Well, life goes on. My romance ended, the war ended, and I soon settled into a happy life with a steady husband, a good job and a wonderful son. When The Way We Were was broadcast on Turner Classic Movies recently, I practically forced my college-age son and his love of three years to watch. After their initial excitement at seeing a very young James Woods, Streisand at the peak of her beauty, and the political turmoil they had studied in history, they lost interest. I stuck with it but found myself surprisingly disappointed by a film that I had considered one of the top romantic films of all time. As other reviewers have noted, you just wonder what, besides his gorgeous looks, attracted Katie to Hubbell. His writing? When does he find time to write amid their partying, arguing, and making up? He seems to adore her, yet he sleeps with another woman. Then, after Katie has his child, he lets her move to New York, and we get the impression that in the time between then and their reunion, he has had no contact with his daughter. C'mon, Katie, the guy's an absentee father! He's not worthy! After the movie, the TCM commentator said that in the original screenplay, Katie left Hubbell because she feared her politics would get him blacklisted. It was her decision, a protective move. I would have liked that better - to keep Hubbell as basically a faithful, good guy caught in the troubles of the times instead of a shallow, opportunistic schlump. OK, I still cried at the end, and I still recommend this movie, but it's not in my top 10. If you love Babs, watch Funny Girl. That's maybe in the top five.

Nothing painful about this film. It will not be forgotten.The story basically points to the fact that Streisand, in a perfect role for her, is an activist and total non-conformist.

Instead, he tries to silence her again, and then weakly let his film be mangled. Hubbell wants Katie to stop challenging him to do better for himself, to want nothing more for him that he actually can work towards. She has more faith in him than he does, but he wants her quiet so he can take the easy way out. Multiple times, he tries to silence her- he frequently tells her to be quiet, and he actually puts his hand over her mouth at the party (granted, she's supposed to be Harpo- on a side note, how is putting on thick eyebrows enough for some of the guests to pretend they're in any swing of things as far as Marx brothers costumes go? It's as bad and dull as the jokes Hubbell's friends make- commentary forthcoming). He wanted her to accept his friends' horrible, dull environs and crass in the horrible, tasteless, unfunny way of humor, and was upset when she didn't want to partake of it. The only mistake Katie made was in thinking Hubbell was worth her time or efforts. She put her own life on hold to go with him to Hollywood to make his dull film. But while she was there, she still managed to make an impact, heading to Washington, D.C., to protest the House Un-American Activities Committee's blacklist. Thankfully at that point he didn't try to silence her, and actually came to her defense briefly to punch a guy who insulted her. Aside from that momentary gleam, Hubbell has no potential. And even then, he followed it with their core differences- he has no hope for the future, and doesn't mind the melancholy, drab, mediocrity he dwells in, whereas she seeks better and tries to implement it.Hubbell simply doesn't care for Katie, or for himself. He is perfectly content to live his vapid and pointless life, and doesn't mind hurting Katie along the way. Even his friend, J.J., who made those tasteless jokes, told Hubbell Katie was really somebody and somebody you don't want to lose. Hubbell of course doesn't get it, and cheats on her with the very person J.J. considered no one special. Plus, Hubbell knows Katie is pregnant at the time.She finally ends it with him, and her giving birth is as sad as it should be happy- the baby is fine, but the relationship that could be- the potential she hoped for in him- is all gone.When they meet later, he is still incredulous at her ambition, or his inability to put a damper on it. Despite his attempts to make her dull, or lose hope, or become boring like him, Katie is still seeking change and a better future. He has no concept of trying, when he is so emphatic about stagnation and giving up. After she's left him standing with his new lady, she is done with him, and goes back across the street to protest the bomb. As she's focused on her demonstration, he follows her, crossing the street, just to say, You never give up, do you?When they were in college, Hubbell wrote a story feigning ambition, to have things not be easy- but it was all words. Sadly, even that story's recognition in their short story writing class led to real action by Katie, to stop pursuing her own writing, and tear up her work. She buys him a typewriter. He doesn't get one for himself- she gives him the tool. Still, as Hubbell, it was all a farce. Like the lies of the short story, Hubbell puts up a front, writing 8 chapters of a second novel, which later does not come to fruition. Katie asks if he ever intended to publish it No. If he ever wanted to move to France No. The closest thing Hubbell ever comes to ambition is his proximity to Katie. And even then, he tries to corrupt her into stagnating and giving up, and giving in to society, as he does.She thinks his writing style is absolutely gorgeous. This is a clear reference to her fondness for him, and his own attractiveness. Let this be a lesson to all-- no matter how pretty the words, or the man, it is the action that counts. Without action, there is nothing, and Hubbell has no idea about action, whereas Katie is action, and drive, and spirit, and motivation. Hubbell is stagnation embodied. He is attractive enough, has the right friends, the right place in society. He has and is nothing. Especially compared to Katie. Without action, there is no potential.So unlike the Hubble telescope is he. He has no perspective, no forward-thinking, and no ambition whatsoever. Katie tried to see in him, but there isn't anything to see.In no way is this a romance for the ages, but in every way is it a delightful, cautionary tale against giving your life and soul to someone who doesn't deserve it.

Katie runs into Hubbell, a good-looking guy she met in college and whom she had a crush on. But as she is rather homely, her love for him was hopelessly unrequited. She invites him up to her place for a cup of coffee, but he is so drunk that without realizing what he is doing when he comes out of the bathroom, he gets undressed and falls asleep in her bed. She gets naked, slides into bed with him, and encourages him. Without really knowing what he is doing, he has sex with her, and she hopes he knows it is Katie he is making love to. But by the next morning, it is clear that he has no memory of what happened, and he merely thanks her for letting him sleep there.In evaluating this scene, we must do so from the vantage points of three different periods the end of World War II, when the scene took place; the early 1970s, when the movie was made; and the twenty-first century, when we watch this movie today. In other words, each of these three different periods will tend to yield three different moral judgments about that sex scene.But first, let us reverse the sexes. By today's standards, if a man were to have sex with a woman while she was too drunk to know what she was doing, that would be rape, for she would be in no condition to consent. However, in accordance with twenty-first century egalitarianism, we would not limit it to just a man doing that to a woman. Rather, we would say that if one person had sex with a second person when that second person was too drunk to know what he or she was doing, then the first person has raped the second person. This allows for the possibility that a woman could rape a man, a man could rape a man, and a woman could rape a woman. In other words, by today's standards, Katie raped Hubbell.In 1944, when the scene took place, if it had come to light what Katie had done, no one would have called it rape. Katie's behavior would have been condemned, but not as an act of rape. Rather, she would have been regarded as a slut, in that she had sex without being married. And in no way would Hubbell have been thought of as victimized.In 1973, when the movie was made, the people who made this movie probably did not think of it as rape either. And given the fact that it was made after the sexual revolution, what Katie did would not have been condemned as slutty either. In other words, the audience of the early 1970s would not have been inclined to condemn Katie at all.In fact, the people who made the movie in 1973 probably had no idea that over forty years later this scene would challenge our willingness to apply a single standard to both men and women when it comes to rape. In other words, if a man who takes advantage of a drunk woman can be charged with rape and sentenced to a year in prison, should the same sentence be given to a woman who does that to a man? In particular, if The Way We Were were set in the twenty-first century, would we say that Katie should have gone to prison for what she did to Hubbell?Some people might argue that since she and Hubbell later fell in love and got married, that made it all right. But suppose a twenty-first-century Hubbell were to realize what happened when he woke up the next morning. And let us further assume that this twenty-first century Hubbell was outraged and felt disgusted by what happened. Under those circumstances, should Katie spend a year in prison?I confess that I have a double standard concerning rape in such a circumstance. First, I would find it hard to believe that even a twenty-first century Hubbell would be all that put out by what she did. And second, I would not want to see Katie go to prison in any event.But my views are not important. What is important is that this scene in the movie, imagined to take place today, tests our willingness to apply a single standard to both men and women in such cases. Most people I know, after some hesitation, will admit that they would not want to see Katie do hard time.

It was smack dab in the middle of a series of films starring Robert Redford that I not only saw, but greatly admired -- The Candidate, Jeremiah Johnson, The Sting, and The Great Gatsby. And while I was not quite so enamored with the consistency of SOME of Barbra Streisand's films of the same period, I was still impressed by her impeccable voice and a number of impressive films she had starred in. Nevertheless, somehow I missed this film, and over the years chose not to watch it on cable until now.I found the bedroom scene very interesting, though illogical. True, he fell asleep right in the middle of it. But why would she have wanted to make love to him at that point? After all, he had just finished vomiting! Many of my friends had always told me I would like this movie because of its politics. While I did like the movie, politics is actually irrelevant to the first hour and ten minutes of the two hour film. It was a simple love story. Girl meets boy. Girl gets boy. Girl ALMOST loses boy, but manages to hang on and they live happily ever after...well, for a while. The problem that kept cropping up between them really wasn't her liberality, because he didn't appear to be oppositely conservative. It was really the difference between him as a college preppie and her as a sort of schlep. A class issue.However, about an hour and ten minutes into the film it does become about politics -- the Blacklist. Of course, you kinda figure out that once in the middle of the Blacklist controversy she will FINALLY become pregnant. But even then, the Blacklist is not the real story. It's simply the device to show, once and for all, that these two people, who do love each other, are mismatched. And so, girl loses boy.This is a good film, but perhaps overrated. Or maybe it's just that it is a classic love story, but not much more. The performances by Streisand and Redford are superb, and much of the cinematography is lovely. It's a really good love story...and nothing more.

One look at her face and you know what she's going to do &#150; fail. She's always on the outside looking in, incredibly needy and her own worst enemy; scuppering any relationship before she can be rejected &#150; maybe there's a hint of the autobiographical in what she does? However, man can she sing! Now before anyone tries to 'out' me for this &#150; take a look at the bigger picture here. Streisand invariably plays Streisand &#150; that's smart &#150; she knows her limitations and so doesn't attempt anything too grandiose. The rest of the film is just as well-balanced.Robert Redford is also fairly one-dimensional as an actor. However, his dimension is the fifth &#150; on a plane occupied by Steve McQueen, James Dean and other such deceased luminaries &#150; if only he had the good taste to die he would be legend. His skill is on playing to his limitations and attributes also.Sydney Pollack directs &#150; Sydney Pollack IS a legend (Tootsie, The Fabulous Baker Boys) &#150; all great films can be attributed to the quality of the directing. This is a truism. No actor can carry a turkey but a great director can stuff one, baste it and slow-cook it to perfection.As well as being a totally seductive love story (one of the few a man can watch and not run the risk of having to sacrifice his cajones), The Way We Were is that rarest of things in Hollywood, an historical document. It manages to sneak under the radar by telling Hollywood's story in the era of McCarthyism and the 'House Un-American Activities Committee' as Redford's college athlete golden boy discovers not only is he handsome, skillful, stylish and cool but he's also a fairly decent writer who ends up re-writing his own screenplays which are perceived as being 'commie' (It doesn't help that his missus (Babs) is an outspoken Marxist with high fallutin' notions about the first amendment (freedom of speech)).Their relationship is rocky from day one. She becomes obsessed with him the moment she first spies him; he finds her curious and inspiring and her belief in his ability and the importance of his writing whilst slightly maniacal drives him to produce great works. Were it not for her, it is likely he would have stayed in the army or taken a sinecure somewhere and drank himself to oblivion whilst still looking fabulous &#150; Gatsby style! She seems to drift on his coat-tails whilst forever railing against his decadent friends and lifestyle and whatever cause of the day takes her rage on its inexorable wave and they eventually split and rekindle and split again&#133; but not before hammering out the finer points of why 'it..just&#133;wont&#133;work' &#150; this is beautifully done. They know they are doomed. He is too perfect. Everything comes easy to him. She is too unsatisfied, mostly with herself. Nothing is good enough for him in her eyes and everything too good for her &#150; she feels out of place.The scriptwriters; and this is rare, write the rise AND demise of a love story rather than just the development and crescendo of one. They see it out in all of its explosive fury and passionate hopelessness. The characters are believable. It's a thing of beauty to look at too &#150; seventies films have that special something which has subsequently been lost &#150; the film stock permits the audience a certain viscera and tangibility and the sets, costumes, acting, directing, soundtrack and cinematography are simply gorgeous &#150; there's a real craftsmanship to the film. From the flawlessness of every scene, the stills of which could easily be sold as art, to the attention to detail in capturing the era &#150; no expense is spared &#150; no detail overlooked&#133; and the music! One can only be moved by that bloody song.This is the backdrop created for the actors who can only but perform up-to-par and they do. They must have been conscious of the amount of face close-ups where their expressions were paramount or the long drawn out shots where they ARE the scene &#150; or maybe not &#150; maybe Sydney Pollack made the most of what they were doing and not the opposite &#150; who knows? In either case you are transported through art &#150; the effect is like theatre, which in recent times film-makers have forgotten, bent as they are in cramming in as many scenes, explosions, effects, bright lights and noises as possible and labelling it high-octane action (with the notable exception of some of the new generation, Spike Jonze, Todd Solondz et al).I want a film that moves me, not causes me to have to move for fear of developing photo-sensitive epilepsy or going deaf in one ear &#150; where is the craft in that? Where is the art? Always remember, film, at its very core is art.This film is as close to film-art perfection as you will find.Enjoy!

Noble and worthy ambition! And how did Pollockfish fulfill it? He hired Redfordwagon and Strident, the cinematic equivalent of a car wreck. I have always felt that the reason why Redfordwagon was so busy in the 70's was because moviemakers could not come up with a genuinely satisfactory replacement for Cary Grant, so they had to make do with a fifth-rate Rock Hudson Robert Redfordwagon. He is always as bland as cottage cheese, and this movie is no exception. As for Strident, I have never understood her appeal. A sloping, narrow forehead; crossed eyes that pop out so much they practically touch each other; a nose that resembles the beak of a swordfish; teeth that resemble those of sharks and alligators--she is the living proof that Medusa and the Gorgons really existed! Things are not improved by her loud and abrasive personality; put her together with Robert Bland-As-Wonder Bread, and you get the kind of mishmash mismatch of which only Hollywood casting directors are proud. Add to this sorry mess of a screen misalliance the fact that Pollockfish fails completely in presenting an accurate and persuasive portrayal of the historical period during which the movie takes place, and you get a film which is everything that an epic romance should NOT be. My advice to Strident quit movies and politics, and restrict yourself to singing. My advice to Redfordwagon quit acting and directing, and restrict yourself to running the Sundance Film Festival. My advice to Pollockfish quit making epic romances such as OUT OF AFRICA, and restrict yourself to comedies such as TOOTSIE and THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS.

I was disappointed that it was set in the 40's, I was it was set the year the film was made, 1973, because I wanted to see an early 70's looking Babs, but she still looked pretty in her 40's garb anyway. But about Redford &#150; I like him but he's definitely not that great of an actor. But he's ok. I recently saw `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' with him and Paul Newman for the first time, and Newman completely wiped the floor with Redford without half trying. As far as those `70's good looking leading men' types, he pales next to Burt Reynolds, who has tons more screen charisma. Because of Redford's inability to set the screen on fire, and Streisand's overacting and the two of them generating no real chemistry &#150; the big love affair here falls pretty flat. Redford has some chemistry with Lois Chiles though, who of course appeared later in the 007 film Moonraker.But Babs' role - Barbara is cast GREAT  &#150; she plays a left-wing liberal extremist communist! What do you know! And I mean that literally &#150; her character is a communist, and even leads a group called `The Communist Youth League!' Even bigger `shock' was in the DVD `making of' documentary, where Babs and the screenwriter both say how perfect she was for the part of a communist, with Barbara herself saying how she `felt' for the character. Nice! Take that as you will.Of course, Barbara's communist ways go out the window when she demands $13 million dollars for every concert she performs, causing ticket prices to even reach into the thousands. Her extreme leftist politics often dominate Babs' character in the film, often ignoring Redford's pleas for her to lighten up a little, and in true fashion, she can't even resist telling Redford that his director (of his writing in Hollywood) `is an idiot' because she doesn't agree with his politics. How perfect!One telling scene features leftist Babs looking to `shut the other guy up' by going up to a man passing out Dewey fliers, she lies to his face saying `she wants to help,' grabs a big pile of fliers to help pass out, but instead walks down the street and throws them in the trash. Hmmm...Babs, after a decent start, eventually gets `in your face' a lot in the flick, and goes off on ranting tangents very reminiscent of her style in the comedy `For Pete's Sake.' She then starts to become intolerable to everyone around her, including the one guy who put up with her the most in the film, Redford's character. At one point, Redford's character says sternly to Barbara's, after she whines to some of his friends who are taking FDR's death more easily than Barbara is, `&#133;it just didn't happen to you! Everything in the world that happens does not just happen to you personally! Now behave yourself!' What do you think would happen in Barbara's house if James Brolin tried to pull that routine on her!Even as the politics start to overpower the `love story,' it makes no difference as the big love story wasn't that great to begin with. But it does make the film more interesting to watch, especially when Redford constantly tells Babs that her commie ways are a detriment. During one political demonstration where Babs can't keep her mouth shut (like I said, great casting) someone has a great line, `shut your mouth, you commie bitch!' Unfortunately, she doesn't, and Redford gets beat up defending her, which sucks because he's been wanting her to shut her mouth since the start of the picture. Redford then accuses Babs of coming to Hollywood strictly to spread her commie leftist views. They argue and Redford swipes the tableware to the floor. Cool! Again, all the while Communist Babs is making no effort whatsoever to leave the posh lifestyle that Redford's writing success in Hollywood has given her. Just like the real Babs! (She does say how she hates the means though, his writing, the films, and even the palm trees. But she'll enjoy the fruits of the means.)So really, `The Way We Were' really falls flat as a big romance. Actually, the only time I remotely felt anything for the two leads is at the end, when they have gone on to separate lives and Babs happens to spot Redford in NYC (it's so easy you know) and they share a last hug, that wasn't bad, but it was mostly because Redford actually showed some acting talent in the film and had a few convincing looks on his face. Then as Babs goes back to passing out her commie flyers on the street, the main song plays (again) and the credits roll. The song is good, but we've heard the melody many times during the actual film, so thankfully we don't hear the whole song after the film finishes. The movie IMO would have been better if they had someone who was more in sync with Redford, who was the real star of this picture despite his second billing, because Barbara just wasn't a good match for him. Perhaps this was realized and why in her next film, `For Pete's Sake,' she played a ranting girl in modern Brooklyn alongside Michael Sarrazin in a comedy! And unbelievably, they even included the `For Pete's Sake' trailer on the `The Way We Were' DVD! `The Way We Were' is a horrible, horrible mess.

She will irritate you, she will also melt your heart. But instead the character turned out to be flat and lifeless. The night when Katie managed to get Hubble in her bed for the first time, she acted like a pathetic woman who desperately looking to get laid. That's too shallow for Katie's character.I would rather blame the writer who failed to portray Katie in flesh and blood to make her alive from her paper version to her movie version. Barbara Streisand was OK. It was not her fault. She did what she does in the limits. After all I don't really consider her a talented actress considering all her work in her time.On the other hand she wore too much makeup and lipstick that bothered me. Why did she need to do that? She was not one of those ordinary dollies. She was exceptional. That's the whole point. Moreover, her nose, lips and corner of her eyes are weird. We had to imagine that she is not so attractive on the outer side, but has a beautiful mind, so you have to know her closely enough. However, in reality Barbara Streisand's Katie in this movie was far from that level.Now what makes her exceptional? Ordinary people with ordinary mind (Hubble's friends) sit around, smoke, drink alcohol, joke and laugh about this and that. And Katie does not. She is too serious and too stubborn. So what? She also drinks and smokes though she said at one point that she does not drink. So what makes other people a bunch of idiots in her opinion? What makes her so different than the others? Strong political views do not make one intellectual. I insist the writers should have spent more time and thoughts on this point.And does Hubble's character have those special traits that fascinated Katie so much? And what would that be other than being a good catch and ladies' man? Katie was angry with almost rest of the world, but she seemed to be sort of obsessed with Hubble (and Roosevelt of course). This point was not clear either.Robert Redford looked awful in this movie. Bad skin and bad teeth.I would give it 4 out of 10.

What can I say?  As sure as death and taxes, this is what you will see in a Barbra movie Her leading man will be many, many times better looking than she is(which isn't a bad thing); she will be the moral authority of the whole film, meaning that her politics, her philosophy, etc., are unquestionably the right ones; her manicure will figure prominently in several scenes; and without fail her leading man will sigh in wonderment You're so beautiful!  Onto the plot stagey and filled with cliches.  Does anyone really stand on a street corner and bellow Ban the bomb!?????  There is no logic in having Hubbell and Katie marry when from the start they come from two diametrically opposed political camps, and the attraction he may have felt for her (which I felt wasn't at all in evidence) would have been dealt with in a series of backdoor encounters until he got her out of his system.  How can we buy that he would go against everything he knew to be true--that they would never be in sync--and try to build a life with her?  Any why would he be so bummed out that she goes to Washington to protest the blacklist?  It's not like she was bringing crackheads home to rehabilitate, or giving all their money to her causes.  And finally, the most preposterous thing is that when Hubbell learns he is to be a father, he's delighted, but that when he decides to leave Katie he totally turns his back on the baby.  How could all that paternal feeling just vaporize?  He's such a prince he agrees to stay with her until the kid is born, and even sees her in the hospital, then disappears from her life forever, until Barbra has a chance to tell him on the sidewalk that he has a great daughter and that he'd like her.  Huh?  I felt I must have missed some major development, especially when he asks her if she's still married and if her husband is a good father to HIS kid.  Bad, bad editing, I guess.As a love story, this movie isn't one.  As a period piece, it's quite fascinating.  As a Barbra vehicle, it's like all the others, and in spite of yourself you might end up admiring her sheer single-mindedness at constantly portraying herself as a beautiful, sensitive trailblazer.

Male buddy pictures were all the rage -- Redford's usual partner was Paul Newman, and here for once was a love story between a man and a woman. Streisand was a huge, improbable star and Redford was reaching maximum superstar heat. He's never looked better than in The Way We Were.Streisand and Redford seemed like a mismatch, but it was perfect. (And Streisand held out until Redford agreed to do the movie, which took forever to achieve.)Weirdly, this was a great date movie even though (SPOILER)....Babs and Bob split up at the end. It was just such an offbeat love story. Women could swoon at the idea that anybody, even a frizzy-haired campus radical, could land Robert Redford. Men liked Redford and found Streisand's intensity kind of endearing and sexy.These things were unforgettable Streisand and Redford together; that sad, sad, schmaltzy song (a Number One hit and Oscar winner); and the final scene, a guaranteed tearjerker that anybody who has ever broken up with anybody and sees their lost love later (or WANTS to see their lost love later) can relate to.The Way We Were all-star Grade-A tearjerking schmaltz. Loved it then. Love it now -- it's the way we were.P.S.

They love each other but her political commitment bothers him--can their relationship survive?On one hand I love this movie--the title song is wonderful (of course); Streisand and Redford do have chemistry between them; the script is sharp and intelligent; the film looks absolutely beautiful with particular care and attention given to the clothes and settings; it doesn't downplay the politics; the romance never becomes too mushy--but this movie left me kind of cold.I never really believed Redford and Streisand were lovers--they DO have chemistry and she gives out a great performance--but Redford is so stone-faced I didn't know how to take him. Also there was severe cutting in the last reel leaving some serious plot holes. So Redford's non-acting and the plot loopholes seriously damage the film.Still it's worth seeing for all the other actors--all of whom are excellent (especially a very young James Woods and Lois Chiles) and some truly romantic love scenes.

Saw it a few days ago, 30 years later, and ... wasn't as impressed. The acting of Streisand made this movie good. Along with the music (still a tear jerker to me). And the theme of the difficulties inherent in an inarticulately relationship is worthy. But wow, I'm stunned by the reliance on stereotype of unattractive, needy Jewish girl and attractive, talented gentile boy. I myself as an adult couldn't figure out what Katie saw in Hubbell, if she was really the politically intense, principled character she was suppose to be. (Though the chemistry between Streisand and Redford is palpable. Maybe this was also why the movie was such a big hit.) I didn't think Hubbell was inherently a cardboard character, script-wise, as Redford feared. Hubbell had a slime side -- cheating, abandoning his daughter, emotionally unavailable to his partner, arrogant. (All qualities now judged from cultural perspective of early 2000s.) But in movie, these characteristics just seemed to be reasons Katie couldn't hold onto her guy. Perhaps it was Redford who flattened the potential for the character's complexity, giving the character a seemingly monotone integrity, even after behaving in ways that utterly lacked in integrity. I also caught some problems with the script this time around. For instance, I thought it was hilarious (unbelievable) that Hubbell wouldn't know the name of Katie's mother even after they were married and Katie was pregnant. And by the way, what was the catalyst for their last breakup? I realize now I didn't miss anything -- it is missing.

The movie is not perfect, but it does really put it's tush in the wind and try, and frequently succeed.  Some of the best writing I've ever seen in film can be found here, which took me completely by surprise.The scene where Katie first sleeps with Hubbell is notable for being both touchingly romantic and realistically bizarre, as all the best real-world sex is.  It completely surprises, which is something all film should aspire to do.A strange thing I want to comment on  I have now found Redford involved in two absolutely perfect cinematic depictions of sudden violent rage.  Is that a Redford trademark?  But, in TWWW he's an actor, not a director or editor.  Why is the burst of physical rage so similar to and as powerful as Timothy Hutton's violent response scene in Ordinary People, where Redford directed?  I don't go in for the action genre and I'll gladly trade in a thousand scenes of two-fisted bravado for one of these.  They're human-dimensioned and healing.OK, enough.  It's worth seeing for the writing, acting, directing; for the noble attempt to capture a very large human experience on film.

The only problem for me (and others may NOT care about this) is the basic relationship problem. Robert Redford is stunningly handsome, rather quiet, rich and conservative in the movie. So WHY would he be interested in Barbra Streisand's character? She is loud, exceptionally opinionated, liberal and not attractive (this is a BIG acting stretch for her, I know)--at least in a conventional sense. We have all heard the old saying opposites attract, but it is only an old saying and really isn't true. If it were, then believing this relationship would be a lot easier. The problem is, they just don't seem to have ANY common ground. If they were incompatible but had SOME mutual interests or similarities, I could buy the conflict.Fans of Babs no doubt think I'm a moron for not understanding or appreciating her greatness.

Barbara's hair is either a Harpo fright wig (not in the style of the 30s glamour gals at all) or a stiff lacquered curl-infested bouffant so unlike the 1940s that I could puke. What a mess. I haven't even begun to mention the schmaltzy dialogue that is tripe intended to push all our 1960s baby boomer buttons! Was the scriptwriter 12 years old or just drunk? What was Babs thinking? Did she think after 'Funny Girl' and 'What's Up Doc?' that she could do no wrong? Oy, vhat a messy, schmessy malt-filled soda pop bag of baloney this is. My favorite scene is when she is screaming in a bar at Redford over his lack of political correctness wearing a snood the size of New Jersey. Half of the ideas they pose in argument hadn't even been thought of yet, in the 40s. These were the years of the so-called 'greatest generation' (I take offense at that too having been raised by 2 of them) who rolled up their sleeves, sent their men off to die without questioning, and worked in the factories making bombs for the US of A. These people never questioned anything until the 1960s rolled along and after Vietnam it became fashionable to reject. If I am a child of Kennedy, they were children of FDR who basically like a father for years gave them the illusion that all would be well until he died and it obviously was not so well (remember Yalta). They were the 'cocktail generation' who worried more about possessions than baby boomers ever could. It was the time of keep up with the Jones' at all cost--conformity ruled! We never heard about dissenters until the civil rights issues revved up the nation in the late 50s and early 60s. If people suspected McCarthy was wrong, they never talked about it, even behind closed doors. They poured another drink, spun out and slept through the fifties surrounded by their pink and aqua bathrooms and cars and TV sets. I remember, I was there. So, if all you want is to see Babs and Rob in their prime, this is the pic for you. If you want your brain teased and disturbed or challenged, go rent a foreign film.

As with some of his other romance films (Out of Africa and Havana), there is never a sense of absolute love. All of these stories incorporate a mixture of rapidly progressive narratives, but then the intent of each film is focused on the romance between Robert Redford and the appropriate leading lady. Pollack is victimized by trying to capture every possible emotion of a serious relationship. His devotion to the realistic parallels between his characters and real people is (at times) incoherent due to over-exposure.  Pollack always shows the highs and lows of each affair. In The Way We Were, the &#145;happier' times of Katie and Hubbell are mainly captured with montages. It is easier to appreciate the validity of their love if they are seen joyfully running on the beach or sailing in the fresh ocean breeze. Pollack then chooses to exploit the struggles they each have with one another. We are constantly brought back to the question of which person has the &#145;correct' views and beliefs. Katie eventually subdues her political ambitions to be with Hubbell. Later they both realize that she cannot lie to herself, (although this revelation is influenced by Hubble's philandering), and they end the romance. Though their problem seems evident, Pollack tries a great deal to show that there are more serious undertones that burden the couple. At times religious distinctions are subtlety employed, and even the possibility that Katie considers herself &#145;brighter' than Hubbell (which he resents by domesticating her). Sadly, the film's secondary flaw can be found in the disenchanting HUAAC sequences. Katie's crusade is never fully actualized because of poor editing. The black listing of the 1950's was a very serious time for the film industry and this film did not do the impact justice. Arthur Laurents decided to incorporate the event as a part of the romance, but the beginning college sequences seemingly foreshadow Katie's would-be-triumph. Instead, Pollack shreds the last bits of integrity by using the event only as a vehicle to justify the breakup. Perhaps a more interesting climax might have followed if Katie and Hubbell's demise were set against the backdrop of a secondary culmination that should have been Katie's actualized triumph.A bleak, rainy day. Far from Pollack's best.** (of ****) "},{"Title":"One of the worst (and cheesiest) movies I've ever seen.","Date":"30 August 2005","Score":"12 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" In my personal opinion, the combination of Streisand and the over-rated Robert Redford is already a mistake, let alone the mediocre script, the way the actors are directed, and a ridiculous plot!If Robert Redfod was any good at acting at all to begin with, he was better with Paul Newman (and thats a big IF).
