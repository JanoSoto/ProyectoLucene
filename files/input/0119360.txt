The scene with the Exploring Your Masculinity tape (this is the one where Kline is told that real men don't dance) had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes.Unfortunately, everything that I had seen and read about this movie before I went to see it indicated that it was a case of a man who was wrongly outed... period.  When it became evident that he was going to end up being gay (notice his foot-lifting during the kiss with Selleck), I felt very let down.I didn't want to go see an it's okay to be gay movie (there seem to be enough of that type already).  I wanted to see the teacher who seems to fit the gay profile, if you will, gets falsely outed, but nevertheless is straight.Making Peter Malloy (Selleck) gay shows that gay doesn't have to fit any preconceived profile (remember, this is the guy who played Magnum, P.I.). But by making Howard Brackett (Kline) gay, it supports the idea that sensitive, poetry-loving (etc.) men must be gay.  The viewer would have been better served had the movie stuck with the premise that gay/straight doesn't have to fit a stereotype; let manly Sellect be gay and sensitive Kline be straight.Don't interpret this as a gay-bashing/homophobe review; it is not.  I sympathize with Kline's character inasmuch as I am a man in his early 30's who is still unmarried, and occasionally catches the how come he isn't married sort of thing from people.

Debbie Reynolds is utterly hilarious as Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart is also a hoot as the homophobic principal.Gay screenwriter Paul Rudnick really achieves a delicate balance here. He knows the stereotypes and exploits them in a way that's mostly tolerable to conservative Midwesterners and yet mostly inoffensive to the gay audience. It's not exactly progressive, but it's funny and inoffensive, and definitely a step up from the previous year's The Birdcage.

"},{"Title":"IN(ane) & OUT (of touch)","Date":"17 September 2005","Score":"20 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" IN & OUT is certainly aptly titled What was once in as being representative of gay cinema is now decidedly out. When it first came out (so to speak) it seemed so bright and fresh and funny and original -- and now it just seems so, well, lame.As one of the first mainstream films to deal with homosexual themes and become a box office success in the process, IN & OUT was blessed with its uniqueness. It was good-natured, well-intentioned, non-threatening and seemingly politically correct, yet old-fashioned in a Capraesque sort of way. What's not to like? But as gay slowly, but assuredly, became mainstream, sissy stereotyping of gay characters, while certainly still with us, ceased to be the only option for discriminating moviegoers. Thus, there is a backlash; it even became a point of contention in another gay movie. In ALL OVER THE GUY, one gay man saw it as an amusing comedy romp, while his blind date saw it as a homophobic insult. A positive story about coming out strikes some as a phony tale of a cowardly, self-hating homosexual unwillingly being forced out of the closet.Like its TV counterpart, Will & Grace, IN & OUT took anti-gay attitudes and twisted them around so that the butt of the jokes instead became the source. Stereotypes were mocked by the very people who were demeaned by them and in the process the insult was possibly neutralized. In theory, for instance, having a gay man suggesting that a fondness for Barbra Streisand is a sign of homosexuality should somehow show just how ridiculous such an assumption is. And that might be true, if done once. But resorting to the Streisand joke again, and again, and again, and again, doesn't negate the stereotype, but confirms it, again and again and again.Mirroring, very loosely, Tom Hanks' very public outing of his high school drama teacher at the 1993 Oscars, the film gives us Kevin Kline as a mild-mannered, small-town high school teacher whose life -- and impending marital plans -- are thrown into chaos when a former student outs him while accepting an Academy Award. The intended compliment inspires nationwide interest and small-town scrutiny. Problem is that Kline's Howard Brackett denies being gay to everyone, especially his soon-to-be bride (Joan Cusack). This could have made for a semi-serious slice-of-life comedy of social mores, and sometimes it seems to strive for that. But the filmmakers are as ambivalent about the point of their film as Howard is about his sexuality. The film never finds a consistent tone and never really tries to; it is farcical one minute, broadly satirical the next and then desperately bittersweet.The film at first seems to be trying to convince us that, despite all the circumstantial evidence, the persnickety Howard really isn't gay. And Kline seems to be playing the part just that way. Until finally he admits he is gay, but just didn't know it. Huh? It's as if he has been persuaded to turn gay against his will just to fit in with a preconceived image. Plus, his coming out is more like an admission of guilt than a pronouncement of pride, let alone acceptance.The filmmakers seem to want it both ways; to boldly denounce the stereotypes as being unfair and then (nudge-nudge, wink-wink) gleefully snickering in admission that they are all oh-so true. It's pretty much the same message being served up by Will & Grace Queer as Folk and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and other such pop culture sell outs. It is like confronting the homophobe by first admitting that he is absolutely right about everything. The grain of truth within the stereotype becomes the undisputed universal reality.Even granting the film a benefit of the doubt that its intentions are benign, there is this gnawing sense of hypocrisy. Just before the rousing, if predictable, Macho Man finale, one of Howard's students (Shawn Hatosy) shows his support for his beleaguered teacher by coming out at the high school graduation. What seems to be a remarkable act of moral courage is subverted when, in Spartacus style, everyone in the auditorium also announces I am gay! It is supposed to be a Capraesque moment of gutsy small-town loyalty, but it rings utterly false. And worse, it demeans the young man's brave act, clouding whether his pronouncement is even true or merely a noble gesture. A film about coming out trivializes that very act.Then the film ends with a celebration of the traditional heterosexual wedding, as if to tell the straight audience Don't worry. People like Howard are harmless and no threat to your lifestyle. Again, huh? Howard and his problems seem to blend into the crowd, which may be the point of the story Gay's okay, as long as it doesn't get in the way. Yet, even realizing just how shallow and dishonest the film is, it still manages to be, well, funny, especially in its more ridiculous moments. The mock Academy Awards show and Kline taking a lesson on how to be masculine make the film worth watching. It is what it wants to be, a harmless sitcom with only the vaguest connection with the real world. Cusack's over the top performance is grating, but the rest of the cast is just fine, led nicely by the always charming Kline. And kudos has to go to card-carrying Republican and NRA member Tom Selleck for his wonderful stereotype-busting performance he plays a gay character who is not a gay caricature. Something the rest of the film should have emulated.

The townspeople start to look askance at him.Here's the part that annoyed me. He turns out to really be gay.Now why did that annoy me?

I know straight men were been beaten up by high school gay-bashers and called names because they had interests that real men aren't supposed to have. Interestingly, this stereotype of masculinity seems to be less common in other countries.I wish the movie would have broken through the stereotype by having Kevin Kline's character be straight and marry his fiancée, with an epilogue of her gloating about how she has the only husband in town who will attend the ballet with her.I wonder how many teenage boy musicians or artists got beaten up by gay bashers as a result of this movie.

Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a nominee. He is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now this floors Howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television. Howard is even engaged to be married (to Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated performance)so he has no idea where Dillon;s Cameron Drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what Cameron said on the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to YENTL and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to make FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also gets a visit from an out of town reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he's gay too. The moment when Selleck plants a big kiss right on Kline's lips is a classic. But all of these little things have Howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay...much to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancée, Cusack, who is beyond confused. The scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay. There is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous from the film, where he buys a record, on how to be macho, and the guy on the record is talking about how real men don't dance and a disco tune comes on (I WILL SURVIVE if memory serves)and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do, don't dance, but Howard can't help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room. It's hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and gusto. The film is not pro or anti gay...it's just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. Wonderful film.

If you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the piousness of Tom Hanks's speech on the Academy Awards when he won for Philadelphia and pokes fun at Hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a fondness for '30's screwball comedy (Bringing Up Baby, Holiday, The Palm Beach Story) then enjoy!  Far from being a biting satire, the film tries for the exuberance of a Preston Sturges farce and comes damn close.  No, it's not 'deep' or 'powerful' -neither were Romy & Michelle, 9 to 5, or Young Frankenstein- and it doesn't pretend to be; it keeps it's tongue-firmly-in-cheek.  It gets too preachy and maudlin for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale (there's also a locker room scene that could have been cut) but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire, it's like a breath of fresh air.  Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck are wonderfully game while Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley add fine support.  The excellent Joan Cusack's award winning performance is stellar and the great Bob Newhart is, well, Bob Newhart.   The fact that many have been offended by In & Out is as absurd as the mentality of the townsfolk it pokes fun at; personally, I was more offended by Philadelphia.

This really should have been mentioned in the sypnosis for the film, and not been left as a 'suprise' for moviegoers. The second half of the film descends into what is basically a propaganda piece - hey gang, it's okay to be gay!, and feels as if it has been written by a completely different person. The film gets way too preachy, often at the expense of the humour. I'm not against gay people or anything, but the movie never let any other opinions through. The 'acceptance' finale, which tried to be heartwarming, was corny and embarassing. Secondly, it uses almost every gay stereotype in the book (I like Barbara Streisand - I must be gay), which may end up offending gay people, instead of helping to put across their point of view.In conclusion, the film was boring (I should never have to look at a clock expectantly during a 90-minute movie), offensive to straight people and gay people alike, and continually offers a very one-dimensional opinion, which looks slightly out-of-place in a film of this type. Anyway, there was an episode of The Simpsons which handled this issue with much more humour, as well as satirizing the prejudice encountered. Wait for reruns of that instead.

Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprise Oscar nominee, and all supporting cast members do their bit too, the story came about because of Tom Hanks outing his gay teaching when winning his Oscar for Philadelphia, which was a bit controversial, so the source material was good, and this is a very funny comedy.

Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional acceptance speech for Philadelphia in which he outed his high school drama teacher, the nominated film in this version was obviously more Forrest Gump than Philadelphia. Here the Hanks character is played by Matt Dillon.The reaction scenes in most of the film are very funny and, as has been often pointed out, are especially effective as done by Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the eventually jilted bride-to-be.Tom Hanks' actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people don't act that way in real life. But this is a farce and not real life. That being said, it is not as effective as it might be and the misdirection of the final wedding scene which makes it look like Tom and Kevin are about to get hitched I found rather pointless, annoying and a cop out.The highlight of the film for me is, of course, Kevin's scene with the how-to-be-a-real-man audio tape and it is hilarious but certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to Kevin's actions.On the whole, a hoot!

Things are going quite well for him for two reasons he's about to get married to Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), and former student Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) has become an actor and is nominated for an Oscar.Sure enough, Cameron wins. In his acceptance speech, Cameron outs Howard. This blows everyone's minds (to say the least), because Howard believes himself to be heterosexual, as does everyone in town. But immediately, the media descend upon Greenleaf, and the whole place is turned into a madhouse. Howard continues denying everything until he meets openly gay reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). Then everything REALLY goes crazy! Some people may assert that In & Out makes stereotypes about gays, but I didn't see that. The movie really seems like a big excuse to be wild, particularly the Being a Man scene, and a few Freudian slips. And Debbie Reynolds (as Howard's mother), Wilford Brimley (as Howard's father) and Bob Newhart (as Howard's boss) are still great to watch on the big screen. Above all, if there was an Oscar for Best Use of an Old Song (as opposed to Original Song), In & Out would easily win for Macho Man.

One simply wishes that credit could be given them for having put together a really good movie, and in my opinion In & Out doesn't qualify on that count. It's the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - a small town high school English teacher who on the eve of his wedding is outed by a former student who happens to win an Oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self-discovery as he comes to terms with being homosexual. To me, that was the first problem with this movie. Howard didn't really have to turn out to be gay. The movie would have been funnier (and perhaps even more thought provoking) had Brackett remained defiantly straight in spite of the stereotypically gay aspects to his life and the town's belief after the Oscar speech that he was gay. (In fact, I thought that identifying him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes might actually have been rather insulting to the gay community, as well as to straight men who like poetry and believe in dressing neatly!) Kline was decent enough in the role, and largely carried the film. Aside from him, most of the other cast members (although fine actors) were people not really noted for their success on the big screen. Folks like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not big movie stars. I actually thought that the funniest (if very small) role in the movie was that of the super model Sonya, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her oh-so stereotypical model line I promised to do that photo shoot this afternoon. I have to shower and vomit!) In the end, what really turned me off about this movie was the ridiculous ending, starting with the graduation ceremony (and, to be honest, even if someone decided that the graduation was really necessary, the movie should have ended there, rather than proceeding on with the totally unnecessary nuptials at the end.) Basically, I got a few chuckles out of this but nothing more. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Behind the times","Date":"6 June 2009","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Time has not been good for In & Out. In it's day, I'm sure it was seen as progressive and out there, but the boundaries it breaks have long since been broken, and the stereotypes it lampoons have been more or less destroyed. Unfortunately, that's what In & Out relies on, and it makes the jokes seem tired.Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a beloved English teacher at a high school in small-town Indiana. His world is about to be turned upside down when a former student, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) announces to the world that Brackett is gay in his acceptance speech. Even worse, this happens three days before his wedding to Emily (Joan Cusack).The acting is great. Kevin Kline delivers a fine performance as Howard, displaying great comic aptitude while still leaving room for the audience's sympathy. Joan Cusack is even better as Emily. One might wonder why she received an Oscar nod for this film (this is not the kind of film that the Oscars usually recognize), but it becomes clear her biggest scene. However, the best performance comes from Matt Dillon. Dillon avoids the temptation to make Cameron a celebrity jerk (i.e. superficial, snobby, etc.). Cameron is actually a likable guy. Supporting performances from Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley (Howard's parents) are good, though Bob Newhart is awful (due to the timing and his performance).Frank Oz knows how to make mainstream comedy. What About Bob, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, and Bowfinger are a few of his comedy hits. He keeps things moving, and he knows how to make an audience laugh.Scott Rudkin's script relies on pushing boundaries for humor. But, as I said, the gay stereotypes that he lampoons are so commonplace that they seem tired in today's climate. More importantly, the setting no longer works. Homophobia is not accepted in most parts of the country, and this diminishes the tension from the story, and renders many of the jokes ineffective. Being out is very acceptable today, and the all-around nervousness is not believable any more.In & Out is not a complete waste of time. Ther are some humorous bits sprinkled around.

His parents support him, his friends like him, and so do some of his students.But that all changes when former student Cameron Drake, who's since become a famous movie star, dedicates his win at an Oscar ceremony to Howard...labeling him gay in the process. This turns Howard's world upside down, as the local gossips assume Drake's claim must be true. Howard doesn't know what to do, and his attempts to handle the situation fail miserably. This is probably one of the most prominent areas of the film, where the propaganda's on full display...prior to the climax (more on that later).Howard's whole method of presenting himself is mocked by various people; some criticize his choice of clothing, while others condemn his affection for the films of Barbra Streisand. Another method of research involves him trying to resist dancing to the song I Will Survive, an audio recording previously insisting truly manly men do not dance, for any reason. When Howard gives in, the recording asks, How did you do...pussy boy? An openly-gay reporter (played by Tom Selleck, of all people) kisses Howard at a street intersection, supposedly attempting to force some kind of truth on the teacher. Howard's so freaked out by this, his only objection is it happened at the intersection. Desperate for answers and less chaos, he goes to a priest...who recommends he have sex with his fiancée before the wedding. No, I'm not making it up - that's in the film. He attempts to do so, only to be reassured by his bride-to-be...then breaks her heart at the ceremony by submitting to the pressure and declaring himself gay.It all culminates when Howard is nominated for Teacher of the Year at his school, but the administration bars him due to fear of a potential scandal. Suddenly, Cameron Drake arrives in the auditorium, asking the staff members if all the chaos is about the gay thing. Their manner of refusal is clearly depicted with intentional mockery, of anyone who would oppose homosexuality for any reason. To drive the film's whole point home (namely, that gay is okay and all who disagree are stupid and/or hateful), Howard's present-day students all declare themselves gay; one even says If there's something wrong with Mr. Brackett, there's something wrong with me. Howard's own parents soon join in this mocking form of support, along with the town's fire brigade. The final scene has Howard dancing to the Village People song Macho Man, while his former fiancée cozes up to Drake.The only reason I gave this film more than one star, is because there's some very brief moments which actually made me laugh. The biggest one is probably a scene between Howard's fiancée and the reporter who kissed him. Its the night of the crashed wedding, and in desperation she propositions him. Informing her he's gay sends her crashing out the door of the bar they're in, to which she screams into the night, IS EVERYBODY GAY?! That question could very well have been the film's title; it certainly fits the overall premise.

This comes as news to the fiancée. Also to the teacher, Kevin Kline. Also to his father Wilford Brimley in the same town, who tells his wife, We used to mow our lawn. No more! Also to the high school principal Bob Newhart who will in time attempt to fire Kline. Also to the football players that Kline coaches, though one of them says there are two places where it's OK to be gay Prison, and space, where they kind of float into each other while they're weightless. In and Out is a blithe, PG-13 rated comedy about homosexuality, so mild you can effortlessly picture it spinning off into a sitcom.Everything that this B film for the Birdcage double feature has to say about masculine manner is summarized in a sole dance scene with Kevin Kline, a scene in which is unadulterated enjoyment. There he is, dressed like the legendary lumberjack man's man and practically alone, not including a hilarious surrealistically intrusive instructional tape that is supposed to teach him what real men, John Wayne-type men, do. Otherwise, the end product is a movie so mainstream that you can virtually watch it shrinking from confrontation, a film aimed predominantly at a middle-American heterosexual audience. Thirty years ago this movie would have been contentious. Now it's just droll.Kline is more or less always reliable, if occasionally too broadly theatrical, as a comic actor, here playing an Everyman who struggles to maintain his self-esteem while his life disintegrates. Here he's well-matched with Joan Cusack, as Emily, the fiancée, who has lost dozens or hundreds of pounds under the encouragement of Richard Simmons, with the aim of trimming down for marriage to Kline. She's had a crush on him for years. Now, on the brink of the wedding, her whole world comes crashing down, and even the parish priest is dumbfounded that over a three-year relationship she has never once slept with her betrothed.Kline attempts to solve that, crashing into her bedroom in an overdue exhibition of macho lust. One of my questions is why the former star student, in a clever, ironic performance by Matt Dillon, would tell a worldwide TV audience that he was. No matter; Kline becomes the target of a media onslaught, and a celebrity gossip journalist played by Tom Selleck appears in town to host a TV special detailing the real story.Selleck's character is gay, and gladly ready to verify that information to everyone. He also presumes Kline is gay, in spite of his refutation. So does the high school principal, played by Newhart as a man so reticent and repressed that when he speaks, everything of significance is implied by lengthy, angst-ridden pauses. Joan Cusack, when not going too over the top, has some great moments like when she drones ''Weight has been lost!'' so firmly and gravely, as if saying, Attention must be paid! In and Out is decent half-conscious merriment, an audience pleaser with an ending that bogs it down.

Although audiences likely patted themselves on the back for being tolerant and liberal enough to see the film, the movie revolves around Kevin Kline's Howard Brackett, who is a grossly stereotyped gay man. The movie asserts that a tendency to dance to disco music, revel in Barbra Streisand movies, and dress well indicates one's sexual orientation. Like Queer Eye, the film actually takes a backhanded slap at straight men and stereotypes them as slovenly, dim witted, and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so In and Out is only a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt.Unfortunately, at the center of the film's humor lies a somewhat pathetic character. Howard is middle aged, deeply closeted or in self-denial, and evidently has never had a sex life. A three-year engagement to a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long talks, and watching Funny Lady. Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intended, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show throughout. Most of the film's funniest moments belong to her, although Kline's attempts to resist dancing during an instruction tape on macho behavior are hilarious. He is a gifted physical performer, but the film gives him only few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as the student turned actor, and the clip from his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the movie's gay theme, there is no boy-meets-boy romance, and only one male-to-male kiss, and that smooch is about as erotic as the one between Michael and Fredo Corleone in Godfather II. Although well intentioned, In and Out fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. Howard is fired from his teaching job despite his outstanding performance and credentials, yet little outrage is expressed. Most of the characters are more upset about the cancelled wedding than about Howard's self-realization, which seems to take place overnight, and his abrupt and unjust dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, endearingly portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, and his students rise to support him. However, the sugary finale is as embarrassing to the audience as it evidently was to Howard Brackett in the film. The movie would have been more refreshing if it had revolved around a gay man who dressed like a slob, was a rabid fan of football, drove a station wagon, listened to country music, and lived on fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, In and Out perpetuates stereotypes and, whether they be positive or negative, stereotypes should be consigned to the dustbin of social history.

A tad too simplistic in that a coming-out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite-so-positive.

It sends a positive message that it shouldn't matter what your sexual orientation is, but it just seems to wrap itself up kind of sloppy. That's my qualm with the writing of the film, but the acting was what really impressed me. Kevin Kline gives a hilarious performance as Howard Brackett, the prissy outed English teacher whose life is turned upside down when a former student turned famous Hollywood actor, Cameron (Matt Dillon - Rumble Fish) makes mention of him being gay during his Oscar speech. There is only one problem - HOWARD ISN'T GAY! Howard now is known in his small town as the gay English teacher and it seems he can't convince anybody he is actually straight. To make matters worse he is getting married to his current fiancé in a week who isn't completely convinced he is straight. The first half is wet-your-pants hysterical while the second half will kind of zone you out. Joan Cusack (in an Oscar nominated role) is funnier then hell as Howard's fiancé on the verge of a mental breakdown, and the film has a lot of small parts played by Bob Newhart, Howard Brimley, Debbie Reynolds and Tom Selleck as a gay news reporter who tries to convince Howard (Kline) he is actually gay and should come out.

The good scenes out-number the bad scenes.","Date":"18 April 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  A mainstream, formulaic comedy, `In & Out' is above average, but there are some flaws that are just too hard to ignore. While it tries hard not to offend, it seems to work on the basis that if you like Barbara Streisand, or look neat, or like your job then you're gay. Luckily, it doesn't try to discriminate or make fun of the alternate lifestyles of the title.The first half of the movie is genuinely entertaining with some funny situations. But after the wedding scene, it gets too sentimental for it's own good. From there on out (pardon the pun) there are some humorous and enlightening scenes (the bar scene) along with those which are just too corny to take seriously (the `everybody's gay' finale).The casting ranges from good to very good. He was well into his mid 40's at the time but Kevin Kline was a good choice for the lead role. Ditto Tom Selleck as the gay news reporter. Matt Dillon was going on 34 at the time and was still playing a 21-year-old. You really have to lay down the line at some point in time. In Debbie Reynolds's first big hit since `Singin' in the Rain' back in 1952, she does a fairly standard job as the mother. It's surprising to see, what is usually considered your typical love interest, being nominated for an Academy Award. But Joan Cusack is very funny as the unintentionally ditzy, loudmouth fiancée, the role that she does best.The film starts out brilliantly with its acceptance speech sequence, and the `Oscars' scene is a laugh riot. For the remainder of the film it doesn't maintain that peak but still works well as a mainstream comedy.

In & Out is the funniest movie I've seen recently. It has one of the most intelligent stories I have ever seen! Every hilarious scene is filled with irony and self-directed criticism to the own American society, who tries to hide everything that doesn't fit well. The most clever and sarcastic scene is when Howard states he's gay in moment of her wedding, and once his mother hears that, she tries to fix it by saying he meant he is having a wonderful day. From that moment on, I just kept constantly laughing, getting surprised every while. Other than that, not only directing and writing are great, but the cast is also extremely professional, delivering unexpected situations all the time. It's also interesting to notice how filmmakers show the way men are supposed to behave; we've always been induced to not dance, sing, speak mildly and stuff like that, otherwise we'd be compared to female or homosexual guys, which we should run from. You know, this movie was released in 1997, but current society is still very chauvinist and intolerant, in a point that I don't know if it changed significantly since the nineties. The controversy whether the main character is gay or not is irrelevant in this movie, given that the main pursuit is show how people behave in situations like that-- and I may state it's completely real. So that's it. In & Out is one of the most mature, clever and surprising comedies you'll ever get a chance to see. Congratulations for the team!

Frank Oz and his writer Paul Rudnick, would appear on the surface to have wanted a picture oozing intelligence, a poser encompassing the outing of a successful and popular school teacher, right there in the heart of America. Sly digs at Hollywood and small town mentalities aside, In & Out is ultimately remembered for two things, its fine cast and the gay stereotypes that litter the piece. Well groomed men who like Barbara Streisand are clearly gay it seems, yes it's that sort of film, the kind that was out of touch back in the late 1990s, never mind when viewing it now!.So it's with the cast that it mostly shines, Kevin Kline as Howard reminds everyone just what a fine comedic actor he is, and so too does Tom Selleck, who revels in poking fun at himself here, with the results from both men bringing the picture its comedy highlights. The always capable Joan Cussack was Oscar nominated as Howard's incredulous wife to be, Emily, and Wilford Brimley and Debbie Reynolds shine as Howard's much bemused parents.

Essentially the entire film is about one man coming to terms with his own sexuality and realizing that perhaps he isn't who he thought he was.This was supposed to very clearly be a satire of homophobia and the macho-male attitude (displayed in the sequence where Kline takes man lessons and winds up dancing flamboyantly, unable to control his manliness).As such it's entertaining but not quite as substantial as it thinks it is. I don't really like the constant preaching - at first it's OK but after a while it gets a bit old. We get the point. Also I thought the ending was a bit dubious, I understand what they were trying to get across but it didn't seem realistic and Kline's character goes through a seemingly overnight change.This is a piece of liberal propaganda to be sure (it pushes the boundaries on everything in a PG-13 movie -- male-kissing in particular, something you didn't get a lot of back in '97) and that will probably turn some people off.But Kline is very funny and believable as a repressed gay man. Some of the misunderstanding physical humor scenes are very funny (this is stuff in the vein of American Pie and such where things happen to the main characters and they suffer extreme embarrassment).Director Frank Oz (voice of Yoda and the Muppets, director of The Score) handles the material rather well (up until the ending) and Tom Selleck has a funny role as a gay anchor man.All in all, In & Out will entertain you to be sure; its performances are funny, it has some good physical humor, it has amusing cameos and its satire of sexuality and homophobia is better than expected; unfortunately some of it is a bit too schmaltzy and unbelievable to take seriously, and that's what restricts it from being a better film.If you just want a good rental, though, you could do a lot worse.

Oh, he likes to dance to music, than he must be gay. His confession at the marriage felt like a bending down to society's wishes.

FOR ITS TIME it was revolutionary. Now--13 years later--it comes off a stupid, trite, VERY innocuous and exceptionally condescending. First off--the basic plot. Brackett has NO idea that he's gay...but a former student DOES???? He's in his 30s--don't you think he would have figured it out by then? The reactions by his students are extremely condescending. NO student would react the way these kids do. The language is carefully kept at a PG-13 level so as not to offend anyone--but these kids come across as total idiots with no idea how the human body works. Also EVERYBODY in the town accepts it completely! AND the stereotypes! According to this all gay men are limp-wisted (that's so offensive I was shocked), LOVE Barbra Streisand and are clean and prissy. Hard to believe a gay man wrote this. To make matters worse most of the jokes simply aren't funny or are dated. Glenn Closes's announcement of Best Actor nominees is funny only if you know who Steven Segal is and remember that she was in Fatal Attraction with Michael Douglas. Everybody remembered it in 1997 but maybe not now. Also the ending rips off Spartacus and was so unbelievable and condescending that I got angry at the film!This gets a 4 (and I'm being nice) for a few reasons. The initial reactions of Kline and the town to his being outed IS funny; Joan Cusack is hilarious when she loses it at the end; Tom Selleck is clearly enjoying himself; it's kind of fun to hear Debbie Reynolds declare she's a lesbian; there's a hot and long kiss between Kline and Selleck and the message is that it's OK to be gay.

So Howard instantly not only becomes the headline personality at Greenleaf, Indiana, but also attracts Hollywood media, especially from the outed-gay anchorman Peter Malloy (Selleck). In order to quench everyone's worries and inquisitiveness, Howard's denial is ostensibly plausible, he is at most metro-sexual and painstakingly attempt to shatter the hackneyed idea of gay men to be masculine with the collateral damages including Barbra Streisand's not-so-productive filmography and the heterosexual men's privilege to dance. Yet, the crunch arrives in the big wedding day where self-deception can not hold back the truth, Emily indignantly runs away from the alter in her wedding dress and apart from that, everyone else seems quite calm-cool-and-collected. The farce then takes a detour into a self-imposed queer-in-distress scenario for Howard in the third act after his spunky and honest coming-out, when he is fired for his sexuality and waiting hapless for the unanimous succour from his family, students and friends, which righteously secure a feel good ending to bolster the right opinion, one might appreciate the effort and motivation, but honestly speaking the entire grandstanding is very much contrived and cringe-inducing. The biggest selling point is Joan Cusack's second Oscar nomination for a genre rarely gets the attention of Academy members, and an outstanding feat for a comedienne to replicate her recognition again after WORKING GIRL (1988, 7/10). Cusack never shies away from being an unassuming wallflower and her predicament in the film does lift the awareness of the unethical cost for a closeted gay man to marry an unwitting woman. Kline is quite competent as well, suave but internally is waiting to be swept off his feet by a kiss from a man, pitifully there aren't ample room for the romance between him and Peter, but his dancing routine and spontaneous respondence showcase he is an ingrained comedian on precise tempo. The story is elicited by the real event of Tom Hanks' Oscar acceptance speech for PHILADELPHIA (1993) where he openly thanked his gay teacher, and the rest is the screenwriter Paul Rudnick's wide fantasy, anyhow, it is pretty impressive to realize how our world-view has evolved towards homosexuality in a measly 17 years purely gaging by how dated this film looks, still, in the much conservative corners of the world, it will be a long expedition to indoctrinate the equality against wrongly-rooted prejudice, religious narrow-mindedness and man's primal fear of wanting virility.

For my taste and sensibilities this film is truly out in left field somewhere. It's not that the acting is bad...it's the story that I simply do not and cannot fathom...and I happen to be gay! It is said that this piece of brilliance was hatched from a true story concerning the acceptance speech given by Tom Hanks, upon winning his best actor Oscar for Philadelphia. During the Let me thank everyone for everything that has happened throughout my life phase it seems Mr. Hanks accidentally outed one of his teachers and another student in the bargain. So, here we have the premise for In & Out, presumably a spoof on that Oooops moment, but even as a spoof it fails. It's simply not tongue-in-cheek enough, funny enough or ridiculous enough to cover the territory. Using the same backdrop as the original incident, the Academy Awards, and with many, many fine uncredited stars appearing, the writer offers up a very well respected, well liked teacher and coach as the outed victim. He is from the mid-west and is just about to be married to a Twinkie eating and overfed, Joan Cusack. It seems that on Oscar night, the entire population of the town is watching the broadcast because a native son is up for the award for Best Actor and they are suddenly catapulted into a world they know very little of because of his acceptance speech. There doesn't seem to be any other closeted or suspected homosexuals in the town...and certainly no one that is out! OK...fair enough, but from here the story takes on an Oz like twist. Our outed teacher does not lose his fiancé, friends, family or the support of his students and while he does get fired from his teaching job, comes back to support his students at graduation and sits on the stage with the school officials! Scores of reporters descend upon the town to cover this news event and one of the reporters (Tom Selleck) turns out to be gay! There is neither horror or hilarity at this unveiling, however, and our teacher tries to show he is not gay. He is being married in just a few days and the wedding is still on. In all the situations set up to make one laugh, the writer falls short of his intended reaction. In the scene with the priest we should have roared, the scene listing the many tips that might have revealed his sexuality should have made us fall down in laughter, his fiancé's continued befuddled reaction to all of it, the revelation that he has never slept with his intended and his hasty attempt to do so before the nuptials, the bachelor party replete with blow-up doll and good-old-boy innuendo, his parents puzzled reaction and ongoing stiff upper lip demeanor, the eventual wedding service when he finally utters the dreaded words...I'm gay...all should have us sitting with tears rolling down our cheeks from laughter but it all went for nothing. In all, it would seem his only real penance is that he ends up not winning the Teacher of the Year award! There is but one very funny moment in the film and that is when the lady who uses a walker is dancing to Macho Man by The Village People near the end of the film. Paul Rudnick, who wrote the screenplay, is himself a gay man and, as such, I cannot understand his treatment of the subject matter. This should have been a hilarious piece for both the homosexual and heterosexual communities and might have brought them closer together, through laughter, as co-inhabitants and neighbors in a crazy world. The film has not accomplished that either. Mr. Rudnick just didn't capitalize on the funny scenarios he, himself, created because he gave all of them short shrift. I only know that I bought the film, watched the film and am selling my copy as soon as humanly possible to some poor unsuspecting movie goer who cares naught for quality, truth or real comedy!.

Trouble is, Howard's meant to be getting married to fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) and his small-town neighbours are gossipping.It's a funny script but it's a film that relies on good acting otherwise it might have come off as homophobic. Luckily Kline is endearing as oblivious Howard. The scene where he's listening to his cassette tape of a guide to masculinity is very funny, poking fun at what we consider 'manly' men to be. Joan Cusack is a good support as Howard's fiancée. Good lighthearted fun. For those who complain it's dated, the movie can't help it if things have moved on since then. It's not meant to be groundbreaking stuff.The one downfall the film has is that the marketing is not quite straight (so to speak) with us. Watching the trailer, you would assume that Howard was wrongly outed as gay and so the film will poke at stereotypes of masculinity. But by poking fun at gay stereotypes and then having Howard be gay because he fits those stereotypes surely reinforces the idea that men who like poetry or dressing well must be gay, especially as Howard does not seem to harbour sexual feelings towards men. It would have been cleverer to make Howard perfectly straight and decide that he has the right to like whatever he likes without being accused of being gay or not manly.Once you know the plot, it's much more enjoyable.

The only problem is that Kevin isn't gay, or so Kevin thinks. He's engaged to Joan Cusack. Such is the premise of this so-called comedy. (There's a lot of Kevin's character that I'm not going into, with all that is implied about his history and his present supposed wedding.) I say so-called because it's not very funny (I mean, it is funny, but not VERY funny), despite the presence of some great talent with the likes of Kevin and Joan with Debbie Reynolds, Bob Newhart and Tom Selleck. I would guess it's probably the most popular or mainstream film made in the 80s and 90s that centers on homosexuality, and that's probably because of its lame approach to a different lifestyle. It's not a bad film, but I can see how some of both heterosexuals and homosexuals would be put off and/or offended by its treatment of the subject matter. Especially, in the manner of how several people at the end come out. It seems to take lightly a very delicate subject.Having gone politically correct and addressed the awkwardness of it, I will now point the positives of it, which is Cusack, Cusack, and Cusack! She received a deserved Oscar nomination for her work here; she's practically the whole show. In fact, she does steal the film away from Kevin and turns out to be the most real thing about the whole movie. The film's charm relies on Joan and its cute feel to captivate the viewers.

"},{"Title":"To Be Gay or Not?","Date":"24 May 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers. In condemning homosexuality, the film industry has reflected only what the repressive society of its day espoused as an ideology. For example, in the 1962 Otto Preminger melodrama Advise and Consent, straight actor Don Murray was cast as a queer congressman who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle. Gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since Advise and Consent. In the 1997 movie In & Out, (**1/2 out of ****), heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day. While the conservative Hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional queer in Advise and Consent had to commit suicide, the liberal Hollywood of today dictates that the gay English teacher should be embraced rather than maced.Basically, In & Out preaches good citizenship in the garb of a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and scenarist Scott Rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy because honesty always ensures happiness. High school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline of The Big Chill) will be happy only after he comes out of the closet, just as his once-fat-but-now-thin fiancée Emily (Joan Cusack) will only feel happy when she can ditch her diet. Ultimately, the movie contends that straight society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with greater honesty and candor about themselves. The happily outed gay tabloid reporter played by straight actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizes this open-minded commentary.Rudnick's lightweight script embellishes the true life incident that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher. In In & Out, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blond, Brad Pitt style bimbo type actor, wins the Oscar for impersonating a fruity foot soldier. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech. Not contend to stop there, the candid Cameron reveals to a live, television audience that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia, and horror set in as the media descend upon the sleepy town of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would a no-name high school English teacher's sexual deviance spark such massive media concern?) Among those reporters lurks Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck of High Road to China), and he wants to do a week-long exclusive one on Howard. Howard, however, wants nothing to do with the witch-hunting media, especially the pesky Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay charges to everybody, including his fiancée and his mom. Malloy lingers because he smells a scoop. The revelation has turned Green Leaf upside down. High school principal Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) squirms nervously with all the media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that were his marriage not imminent, he'd have to give him a pink slip. Meanwhile, Peter bets Howard that his marriage to Emily will fall through at the last moment and he'll be there to record the result on camera.Howard resorts to audio tapes about macho men. He struggles to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are futile. Guilt swells up inside him. And then there is Peter Malloy, who rags him to come clean about his homosexuality. Finally, at the altar in the sight of God, Howard bursts. Of course, bride-to-be Emily Montgomery is floored by Howard's gay confession. Predictably, the school fires Howard, but he shows up for graduation. Drake shows up, too, and rushes to Brackett's defense. Not only has the school stripped Howard of his job, but they've also given his teacher-of-the-year award to somebody else. Drake appeals to the principal and wins Howard the unanimous support of the community.The biggest defect in Rudnick's contrived script is Howard himself. Rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true, either by gray or straight standards. Howard Brackett looms as more of a saint than a sinner. He helps one student gain admission to college, and he coaches the track team. How often do you hear of an English teacher doubling as a coach, too? Everybody at his high school adores Howard. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body. Further, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that nobody else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are they too scared to come to his defense? No, In & Out is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences. Oz, whose screen credits include cute comedies like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and House Sitter, as well as Rudnick teeter on a politically correct tightrope. In & Out is not a gay recruiting movie. The filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either Howard or Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in shoring up a thin premise Is he or isn't he gay? They flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer. Finally, when Howard admits that he is gay, the filmmakers devote the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative, Norman Rockwell-like town can accept him despite his difference.The most shocking scenes in In & Out is probably when tabloid reporter Malloy does a lip lock on Howard. Straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony. Kline and Selleck grind their faces together in what appears as more of a head-on collision than a closed-mouth kiss. Nothing at all like the controversial 1994 British movie Priest, In & Out emerges as an engaging but labored piece of social propaganda with its okay-to-be-act message. If Ellen weren't the TV equivalent, In & Out would probably be heading toward TV as a new sitcom. Watching In & Out is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes In & Out a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity cheers and jeers about queers and steers.

Any overt suggestion that the male had an active sex life (even if closeted) had to be banned. It's similar to Will Truman's own sex life on WILL AND GRACE he does have one -- we just will never see it on screen unless it's as a forced kiss which is one of the most un-erotic, unbelievable and disrespectful things I have seen in my life.In this story, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), an English teacher in an Indiana high school, is outed by an actor (Matt Dillon) whom he taught and who has just won the Oscar for a male lead in a performance. The entire town, including his parents (Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley playing the kind of roles that Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine did ages ago), go up in arms at the mere suggestion, and there are worse matters he is about to be married. And it's not over -- the media descends on Howard's home town, among them Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck) who not only needs ratings and sees this as an opportunity to get back on top. At the same time, Howard is confronted by the school principal who wants nothing of the sort and of course, Howard himself is baffled by the very idea and tries to prove he is as butch as they come.But life has other plans. No twist turns, no shocking revelations, just an inexorable progression from scene to scene as the preparation for his wedding to longtime girlfriend Emily (a fantastic Joan Cusak) goes underway, his class' graduation day draws closer, and Howard's grasp on his own sexuality weakens, accelerated by Peter Malloy's presence and the intolerance of the school principal (Bob Newhart) who won't allow for this kind of thing.Like I said, the material for the time is as risky as doing a tightrope walk 1,000 feet above the ground. IN AND OUT nevertheless prefers to stick with sharp one-liners that aim for the funny bone and in this department it succeeds. Joan Cusak's meltdown after her wedding goes down the tubes is a behemoth of a scene she verbalizes what I've had in my mind (for different reasons) about Barbra Streisand, and even when I felt sorry for her, boy did she own that moment!I think Kevin Kline was a little too old for the part, and it could have helped if the obvious stereotypical elements akin to what is gay had not been included. But it's more of the same gay-lite fare that came out in the 90s and were aimed at a public not ready for deeper issues. Then again there was never the intention to make an edgy comedy, and this is also okay. IN AND OUT is filled with great performances from its large cast of first name actors and this helps elevate the film from its unremarkable level to a much higher one. If only it could dare and leap forward to explore the one thing it only suggests but never explores, and it's the character played by Shawn Hatosy. As Jack, from the get-go there is something about him that leads me to believe the screenwriter may have had other plans about him but this was scrapped at the last minute and only snippets of 'something underneath' remained. Maybe BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, released this past week, will finally open the doors to what IN AND OUT could only barely muster that gay men aren't only about Broadway show tunes and that yes, we are out there, making role models from those whom we admire. But all we have is a movie that has bright colors, sunshine, and the requisite disco-moment. "},{"Title":"This bites.

Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in a vietnam epic wins the award only to out Howard as being gay during his acceptance speech.This could not come at a worse time for Howard who is just day's away from marrying his fiance and fellow school teacher Emily(Joan Cusack).As you would expect the media reaction is cataclysmic and turn's Howards life upside down.Not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay but evade sleazy news reporter, Peter Malloy(Tom Selleck).Although this was billed as a screwball comedy it's clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also attempting to be satirical.You only have to look at the early scenes at the Oscars cerimonee and the way the people of Bracketts home town as well as the teaching board of the school react to his outing.Sadly the film doesn't live up to the promise we see early on in the movie.This is a pretty flat attempt to make social commentary out of a wacky comedy.A good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really delivers the nessecary amount of laughs and is no where near as insightful as it thinks it.Kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance that he gave us in his earlier comedy 'Dave', making Howard an instantly likeable character. Cusack too is good value as Howard's weight obsessed fiance while Tom Selleck play's very well against type as a gay news reporter.Bob Newhart is a joy also, as the principal of the high school where Howard works.It's great to see him on the big screen for a change.It's a shame that it had to be this.The performances as good as they are can do little to rescue the movie from being a rather dull affair.While a couple of scenes do offer some amusement.Namely the inspired scene where Howard attempts to make himself seem more manly by listening to a self help tape.There is little to enjoy, and when things can't seem to get any worse Rudnick resorts to a sickening finale that lurches in to over the top sentiment. I also couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted.Malloy appears to be too sleazy a character to become the man who put's his ethics before getting a good story while Cammeron finally come to the rescue in the film's climax seems at first to be too self involved a character to care a jot about what happens to his former teacher.After all it's he who caused all the trouble in the first place.'In and Out' isn't exactly dire.But when you consider the likes of Klines better work like 'A Fish called Wanda' you can't help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted.Robs Rating* *  "},{"Title":"forgettable","Date":"7 August 1999","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This film is very forgettable.

It may have been watchable, had I not seen Angels in America, Jeffery, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert or any Scott Thompson stand up.  All of these have touched on the gay issues that several of the other reviewers were piqued about, and did so much more comedically. However, most of the gay humour is unfunny to straights, gays and non-sexual people alike.  It is insulting that so much stereotyping can be done in a Kevin Kline movie, with an audience that is prepared for the more intelligent, sublime humour of a movie like Dave.Worst of all, the ending was a farce.  Simply horrible, mostly because Kline's character is not a homosexually archetype as the film would suggest; he's more of an effeminate heterosexual.  By suggesting that merely being effeminate makes one gay, the movie actually offends the straight man who has similar tastes.  It's a bit like being called antique because you prefer jazz to pop music.  I'd like to see the scene about 4 months later, when Kline's character realises he was never gay, was only playing out a part that was set up for him, and has to explain this to his lover (who really seems to be more of a fling, which is what many hollywood love stories are).I wanted to stop watching this movie after about 30 minutes, told myself it would get better, and it got worse.

From what I saw, this film had four (4) major flaws starting  with (A) Matt Dillion's character as he announces to the world that is former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. Never mind how unbelievable it is that Matt Dillion character won an Oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. But why would he say such a thing? After all, this was never an issue with Howard's students, his friends, family, nor his finace. Nobody. So why would he say something like it when it wasn't true? More to the point, why doesn't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it? The reason is because there is NO answer, and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. The second (B) flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is--the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex. In this movie, being gay is based on liking Barbara Streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. It's all based on stereotypes!Both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony. Matt Dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he arrives to the ceremony, he says nothing, and I wondered why in the world he then came there at all. He didn't solve anything. Then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay, I was so moved I wanted to throw up! Those folks were standing up in defense of Howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes. What the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. They filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! But wait there's more!During the ceremony,(C) Howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher, because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER recruit, and that he wouldn't influence his students. But did we not see Tom Selleck's character endlessly pressure Howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, to come out of the closet when, in my mind, there was no closet to come out of?  From that, the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting. The film, again, then shoots itself in the foot.And (D) when Howard came out of the closet, did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film? I counted only three lines he had afterwards Yup! to his parents, Hi there! to a student, and Are you ready? to Tom Selleck before the last vomitous scene. I might be low by one, but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head, because I never for once believed he was gay.As bonuses, the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes. One in which Howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend (him), who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance. Does that make him gay? he asks. The priest responsed Oh yes, he's definitely gay. Uh-huh. Or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling Howard's mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's deep, dark secret because, well...everyone has them. Then one the ladies confessed that she's never seen The Bridges of Madison County. Funny? No! Becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he/she is gay. I know. I have several friends that are gay, and none of their families took it well at all. That was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation.The last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when... It wasn't what you thought! I had been thoroughly disgusted by that point, and I never could forgive that sick joke. I have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality. Philadelphia and Longtime Companion were very honest and true in what they had to say. In & Out is just screaming for political correctness, but has no idea of the corruption at its core. what I gathered from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, meaning if you have the slightless doubt, YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY. It's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. In reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid, you would eventually believe it too, wouldn't you? This is what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry the whole weekend, in fact. This was a seriously sick and cruel film, the WORST of 1997.

The acting was good, but so what? It had me grimacing at most of the unfunny dialogue and stereotypical characters. According to this movie, any man who likes Barbara Striesand movies is gay, and they brought this up three times or more, I mean, sheesh, it wasn't funny the first time, why repeat the joke?The whole movie just seemed like some cut and paste scenario we've seen it so many times before, town gets outraged about the main character for whatever reason, then, oh, surprise surprise, they all come round and stand by him in the end, he's a really great guy, we all love him, so what if he's gay, blah blah blah blah blah.... So corny, so boring.

This is a sweet sanitized story for those who like Oprah and don't question the realities of a story but just go along for the chick flick ride.Kevin Kline is a straight teacher who evidently never has been laid and has never really had any sexual urgings at all. He is a teacher who is old enough to have taught a student who has gone on to a TV career but he is dumb enough not to know whether or not he likes to play dingle dangle dingle with the same sex.He is also a humorously tortured buffoon of an English teacher whose whole approach to be noted as being gay as to run around and say I'm not gay without people believing him.In other words, the Kline character either has or has not had a hard on in his life. He either has or has not masturbated. If he has not masturbated he has the bluest balls of any English and why for the sake of everything would I care about this character. If he has masturbated then what gets him off? Fantasies about men or women or both? To accept that this character doesn't know he is wanting to have same sex physical contact is as ludicrous as his parents driving up with a 4 tiered wedding cake sitting in the back seat of the station wagon. There is no box around the cake and the wedding is a couple of days off...yet his folks drive around with the cake laying loose in the back seat of the vehicle where one wrong turn could smudge the icing???? Yep...I see stupid people.

The  main problem is the plot.  There's a married music teacher who just discovers he  is gay. The plot would have worked out funnier if he actually wasn't gay but it  was a false rumor. Then  he would keep having to prove to everyone he wasn'tgay. instead it ends up all mushy mushy and serious towards the end. Therewasn't any humor at all and I can't beleive it was popular. I guess at the time it  was a controversial movie beacause of the whole 90's We're Here We'reQueer movement. But don't expect a funny movie with good dialogue. NOTreccomended.

Another example of Hollywood's attempt to further the homosexual agenda. I thought from the ads for this film that this would be a rather inoffensive movie, but I was wrong. When Kevin Kline's character turned gay, I could see that the film was more political statement than entertainment. There were, however, good acting performances in the film, particularly Joan Cusack. Kline did well with his part, and Tom Selleck is always excellent, no matter how offensive his role. There were also some very cute lines. The plot, however, destroyed any enjoyment to be derived from these pluses. Grade D- "}]
