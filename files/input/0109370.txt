Not only is this movie subtly hilarious, its nearly perfect as so many people are only contributing to the joke.I recall sitting in a hostel in Switzerland on a trip across Europe, and listening to two American guys drinking and talking to two Austrailians. They were telling them about this hilarious movie called Canadian Bacon that did such a great job of making fun of how stupid and dumb Canadians are.Which only makes the movie better, because it is so obviously, once you are in the know, a satire of America and particularly it's arrogant/ignorant (take your pick) stereotypes of Canada.Truly, with every scathing review stating This movie is a waste of time as it makes obvious stabs at Canada. That country should be insulted and the joke gets old. No, the joke only gets better with every American reviewer who doesn't get it, pushing it that much closer to a truly inspired masterpiece.

It wonderfully picks on the US, and more generally, on any rather belligerent nation that likes to throw its weight around and create excuses for doing so.It also picks on the use of propaganda and even on mass media and mass mob hysteria. This is especially true in the way the film portrays how the American media discusses Canada and how some members of the public react, so that the whole idea spins out of control of those who began it for their own personal reasons. I was barely able to breath with laughter throughout the whole period when the US was flashing its propaganda about Canada and showing how threatening they are, especially how they claimed the Canadians were infiltrating American society and were massing on the border. This is wonderful satire on sensationalist news stations and their willingness to use information in a wildly inaccurate and misleading manner in order to rile people up.The film picks on everyone involved, Canadian and American alike. It attacks the stereotypes of both, highlighting their differences yet also attacking the misconceptions about both peoples. To have a number of Canadians in the film is another flash of inspiration, too, since there are Canadians playing comically stereotypical (i.e., polite, white bread, well-spoken) Canadians and Canadians playing comically stereotypical (i.e., redneck, belligerent, crude) Americans. It adds to the irony since one of the American's propaganda tools is that there are Canadian actors everywhere in the US as such integral parts of the American entertainment industry that they are taken for Americans, and lo and behold, here some are playing various people in this film.Some parts of the film were simply silly, with jokes that were more gags rather than actually furthering the satire and points of the movie, and this is a weak spot. While some were funny and worked, others were a bit inane and the film would have been more successful had they stuck to developing the real themes and satire of the film, which are what make it great.Anyway, despite some weak points, this film is a brilliant satire that contains a number of parts that are utterly hilarious. It did not fulfill its full potential, but it is not too far below perfect and the good parts are really, really good.

Michael Moore wrote, produced and directed this film and he was born in Flint, Michigan. In fact his much acclaimed earlier film Roger & Me was all about his hometown and its unfortunate plight.With that out of the way I'd like to say that Michael Moore did a wonderful job capturing the humour in the quirky traits and differences that separate Canadians and Americans whether that be Canada's pride for hockey and their beer or America's ignorance of Canada as a whole. The film is filled with funny little political hints and satire of the typical Moore fashion that helped make his last film Bowling For Columbine the best selling documentary of all time. This movie is not a documentary but rather a witty story that brings forth the same concept of a president creating a fake conflict to boost poll ratings that Wagging The Dog was to later use more seriously.Some of the comments made in this film show eerie foreshadowing to what has happened in the world since it was produced.No matter what your motivation for watching this film you can expect to get the same formula of political commentary delivered with wit and humour that you get in all of Michael Moore's Films, TV Shows, and novels.

There are certainly a lot of things that we could learn from Canada about living among each other in peace, and Michael Moore wants everyone to know that, at the same time as he makes fun of their apparently childish approach to crime control.It's an occasionally clever political romp that is never laugh out loud funny and doesn't contain a single noteworthy performance, but I suppose it is interesting enough, if only as a curiosity piece about the early work of Michael Moore, who has made inarguably the most controversial and notorious political documentaries of all time with Bowling for Columbine and, even more, Fahrenheit 9/11.And, of course, Moore makes an appearance in the film as, well, as himself, really &#150; a loudmouth political activist.

Some will watch it expecting to bust a gut, and there are plenty of sight gags to keep you laughing, but the political elements are the funniest parts.  This is one of those smart comedies, because most of the jokes are not going to go out and smack you in the face.  The plot has been duplicated and called original (cough...South Park cough) because the idea IS so unique.This film has a storied history itself.  Michael Moore wanted to make this movie solely a satire and the studio wanted it to be a straight comedy.  This film had Eddie Murphy, Roseanne and Tom Arnold and other names in the early '90's attached to it early, but all of the stars had to do other films, while two studios fought over the rights to the script and film.  All together it took Moore about 5 years from original concept to finished product and by the time it was nearly completed, John Candy had died, and reshoots were changed or cancelled.  The film of course bombed, because neither studio really tried to promote the film, Moore refused to promote it, Candy couldn't promote it and so the film pretty much went directly to video.It's still a great flick.  Alan Alda's performance is great and Kevin Pollack does a remarkable job.  It's not a typical Candy performance, but he still has fun with it.  Yes, there are a couple plot holes, but almost every single joke works if you understand where Moore is coming from.  This is not an anti-Canadian movie, because most of the cast is from Canada, and they obviously did this film to spoof American views of Canadians, American politics and because the film was totally different.This is an original movie with enough laughs and humor to hold it's own, and I wish it wasn't blatantly ripped off by two stoners for their unfunny little cartoon movie.

It falls somewhere between the zaniness of Airplane and the black comedy of Doctor Strangelove. It's far funnier than other let's-go-to-war-for-political-reason movies like The Mouse That Roared or Wag the Dog, even though it doesn't seem to have had much of a budget. Yes, it's silly, but what makes the jokes effective is that they follow a scenario that has become so familiar to us in real life. An adversary or non-adversary like Canada (skewered here, as much as the US is) masses troops along its border. The media report Canadians are building a monstrous weapons system, that they are filtering across the border in untold numbers and are walking among us, that they plan to impose their way of life on us (enforcing anti-litter laws and pronouncing about as aboot.). They take a hostage. They put up the world's tallest free-standing structure as an in-your-face insult. We try to provoke some incident that we can claim as an attack in order to build up tension. The idea is not to go to war, because a war with Canada wouldn't last long enough. The idea is to return to the days of the cold war when we had a booming defense industry, lots of solidarity, a common enemy, lived in constant fear of annihilation, and everyone was happy. Moore must have carefully combed the archives for every run-up to every war since Grenada. I don't want to get into it in any more detail because it would spoil the gags, but I'll mention just one. John Candy and his gang (there are lots of Canadians in the cast) are driving near Toronto (which they believe is the capital) in a garbage truck decorated with sprayed-on slogans like, Canada Sucks, and Eat my Drawers, and USA All the Way. They are pulled over by a motorcycle cop (Dan Aykroyd) who politely asks Candy to step out of the vehicle, leads him to the side of the truck, points at the graffiti and asks, What's wrong with this picture? Candy begins to stutter and blame the kids back in the garage, but Aykroyd cuts off his explanation and says he's not concerned about who put it there, but he IS concerned about Les Quebecoise. Every sign in Canada must be printed both in English and in French, and he makes Candy spray a French version of the slogans on the truck. Oh, well, one more -- just because it's short and offhand. The president and his advisors wonder how to get back the hostage the Canadians are holding. One aide suggests bringing in the Omega force. Everyone is awed by the suggestion. Even the rabid general asks, Isn't that a little drastic? And another adviser adds, Sir, the Helmsley Law, Part Two, Sub B, specifically forbids the use of the Omega force against Caucasians. Something like that.The acting is good, especially Allan Alda as the nudnik president, but little acting is required. As a director Moore gets the job done but doesn't add much. What made Doctor Strangelove exceptional was the realism between the comic moments, the battle scenes for instance. Here, Moore has the Omega force not just running across a field but high stepping, which isn't really as funny as it is silly. (The last man in line trips over a stone and sprains his ankle, hollers out, Save yourselves, and another one runs back and shoots him on the spot.) Moore as a writer turns out to be a more astute humorist than I'd expected him to be. (One Canadian prisoner, in a psycho biker's get-up, is serving his term for trying to use regular gas instead of unleaded.) It has its funny moments.

During his long career, he has raised tons of controversy with his documentaries, especially during this decade, with the likes of the widely seen films, Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11. A few years after making his debut, Moore made this fictional piece, which is his only non-documentary film to date. Canadian Bacon is a comedy film, one which unfortunately didn't turn out so well.The U.S. President is currently doing very poorly in the opinion polls, with the country's economy dropping very low. To raise his popularity, the President is convinced that he must start a war, something which he has never done before during his time in the White House. So, he decides to conduct a cold war against Canada. He uses the media to lie and do everything else he can to make Canada look bad and manipulate the American public into believing that their northern neighbours are their enemies. Bud B. Boomer, the Sheriff of Niagara Falls, crosses the border with Deputy Honey, Kabral Jabar, and Roy Boy, where they all intend to attack! As you would expect from Michael Moore, this movie is very political, and if you're familiar with his political views, it shouldn't surprise you that this movie bashes the White House and the American military, whether you like it or not. Neither Americans nor Canadians are portrayed in a positive manor in the film, as neither are portrayed as very bright. Some Canadians have been offended by this movie, due to all the stereotypes, but personally, I'm not. In fact, I think one of the only remotely funny parts is the one where Sheriff Bud B. Boomer causes a riot at a hockey game in Canada when he says that Canadian beer sucks. I think the part where the RCMP Officer says I don't know what you're talking aboot, eh? gave be a bit of a snicker as well. However, most of the jokes, whether they're jabs at Canadians OR Americans, are simply not funny.Comedian John Candy, a Canadian, starred in Canadian Bacon as Bud Boomer. The movie was released after his tragic death in 1994 from a heart attack, and his role in it was the last role he ever completed (he died during the filming of Wagons East). I was only about 7 1/2 years old when he died, and had never heard of him during his life. However, I have since discovered how great a comedian he was by watching SCTV, a classic sketch comedy show, as well as the hilarious slapstick comedy Planes, Trains & Automobiles. Canadian Bacon, however, is not a highlight of Candy's career, though he might add something to the film. R.I.P.A comedy movie about a war between America and Canada sounds like a good idea, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a MUCH, MUCH better job with it when they made South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut! In Canadian Bacon, the jokes are mostly mediocre, and the movie may start out SLIGHTLY promising, but just drags for most of its approximate ninety-minute run. It appears that many have enjoyed this movie much more than I have, so I won't say avoid it like the plague, but I wouldn't expect a classic piece of political satire, and if you have high expectations, don't be surprised if they are not met.

An idea that sounds over-the-top is indeed portrayed humorously, but amazingly not too far-fetchedly.Many top actors appear, such as John Candy (in a role that could have been easily played by Moooe himself) as a New York police officer, Alan Alda (as the president), Rhea Perlman (as Candy's partner), Kevin Pollak (as the presidential aide), and Rip Torn (as a general). Moore himself appears as a protester. Although Canadian Bacon isn't nearly as good as any of Moore's documentaries, this film is a good political satire and stays true to his other films. At the end, everything is a little bit disappointing, for the brillance of the first half, but still an entertaining and recommendable film. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Great satire.

It is clearly poking fun at the relationship between our countries, plus mocking American foreign policy. It takes it's roots from Dr.Strangelove, although it is more light-hearted and goofy at times.The plot is pretty thin, but it works. Military industries are closing after the collapse of the USSR, the president's reputation is plummeting and he needs an enemy quickily. After failed attempts to mix it up with the Russkies, or Korea or Middle Eastern countries, his advisor eventually comes up with the idea to portray Canada as a menace. Conflict ensues, when Niagara sheriff Bud Boomer and his friends takes it upon themselves, to wage a war against the Canadian Niagara. The plot goes nuclear, with backstabbings and betrayals, that try (poorly) to copy Dr.Strangelove's more realistic (yet still funny) scenario.The comedy is, for the most part, very well-written. The horse-riding mounties correcting each others grammar, the propaganda videos, Omega Force (But sir, Omega Force is forbidden for use against caucasians!), the hilarious scene with Dan Ackroyd (so true - bilingualism is big here, maybe not in the Toronto area though), the confusion over our capital (Canadians don't confuse Washington for New York! Our capital is Ottawa, not Toronto!), our tendancies to say eh and sometimes aboot (although that's debatable) and the fantastic part where the president tries to speak French... (Umm... Arr√™tez les rockettes! ... Thank you, I took it for two years in college.)The movie is frightenly prophetic. The president asks at one point if those Arabs could be an enemy, since they hate us so much. And one general responds All they could do is blow themselves up in a plane (paraphased - the actual line is wittier). And diverting American attention away from domestic issues is a main factor in the newer Iraqi war.The acting is adequate and the abundance of good lines makes this a null point. The plot is probably it's weakest link. The traitor is influenced by money (unrealistic, considering he would making a lot of money off a stable war, anyways) and the ending is happy (a nonhappy ending would be too dark, of course, for this lighter movie) "},{"Title":"See it for what it is.","Date":"16 February 2003","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This movie isn't meant to cure cancer, it's not meant to give you a deeper insight into the human condition, it's meant to make you laugh.

The President thinks that peace is a sign he is doing a good job, but many of the former plant workers do not agree--especially Roy Boy, who intends to make a statement while killing himself in the process.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), he bumbles the effort in a number of ways, and finally has to settle for working with the incompetent sheriff and his partner Deputy Honey.After the visit to the plant, the President's advisers think the best way to boost his popularity is to start another war, so they do some research on Russia and other countries.  No one seems likely to start a war ... until an incident at a hockey game between an American team and a Canadian team.  A full-scale riot starts, and before long the propaganda machine is in motion.  In just days, most Americans hate Canada and imagine all sorts of terrible things about Canadians.  Even worse, R. J. Hacker, who closed the plant, has sold some of our most fearsome nuclear technology to the Canadians, and he too wants to start a war.  An American is taken hostage, and all-out war seems likely.It is clear from the very start this movie is not intended to be taken seriously.  A news reporter covering the President, for example, makes light of the fact that William McKinley, the last President to visit the area, was shot and killed.  And local police get bonuses for stopping suicides--but bigger bonuses for fishing bodies out of the river.This is a very funny movie, with lots of the type of humor that made 'Airplane!' such a success.  Canadian stereotypes are found in abundance, and black stereotypes are not far behind.  For blacks, one example is the fact that during the hockey riot, a black man asked, 'Can't we all just get along?'  For Canadians, the fine for littering is one million dollars.  A graffiti-covered truck is stopped, but not because it is a mess.  It is not bilingual.Alan Alda is great as the President, and John Candy makes a good idiot sheriff.  Kevin Pollak stands out as an overzealous White House adviser. And Steven Wright is great as a mountie who is so calm he would have to be on drugs.If you keep an open mind and just try to enjoy the bizarre humor, this is an enjoyable movie.

Americans along the border are whipped up into a frenzy, and John Candy (one of Canada's best comics of all time) and some of his friends end up volunteering as border patrol in Buffalo, and then they invade Canada.The movie starts off amazing and the premise is great but it goes off the wheels a bit once they go behind enemy lines. The depiction of mounties and some ridiculousness taking place at the C.N.

It's just weird seeing Michael Moore directing a feature film, a politically charged comedy with a stellar cast but distant from what we know he's capable of doing. He's a very opinionated guy, full of energy and with a great sense of humor, so it's frighteningly strange to see this small comedy, almost humorless despite the high caliber comedians starring in it. The premise is similarly absurd as the one from The Mouse that Roared, but the humor and the criticism isn't repeated in here, it's lost somewhere. With the intention of boosting his popularity sky high after being considered a wimp leader who never declared any war, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to declare war against Canada, believing they have secret weapons. Pressured by a failed businessman (G.D. Spradlin) whose weapons of mass destruction aren't selling anymore and he's needy of a conflict so he can sell it, the president's loyal adviser (Kevin Pollak) instigates him to attack the neighbor nation, encouraging him after a small misunderstand involving a hillbilly American sheriff (John Candy) who offended the Canadians by saying that they beer suck. Confusion formed, war declared and loads of jokes on the expense of both cultures. Canadians are presented as jolly, clean, acceptive of insults (except the one about the beer, which was considered atrocious), while Americans are presented as desperate for combat, with limited intelligence and as Canada haters. Where's the sagacity, the acid satire or the intelligence of this? Where's the masterful Moore in this, the one we get used to see while presenting facts to some, distorting them to others yet giving us a full shocking image of what's wrong with the world? Everything is reduced in being a simple-minded comedy, going for some cheap laughs, only getting some inspired moments when it makes cultural and film references, and some of the performances achieve the desired goal of causing us to laugh a little, and reflect about the part they're playing. Alda was the perfect toyed president, surrounded of intelligent and dangerous people who make things easier for him always telling what he must do. His part is what makes this movie more relevant now than when it was made in 1995. Moore was clearly foreseeing one of his favorite future targets, Bush Jr. The similarity of intent and actions are uncanny.This could be a gold material just like Wag the Dog or truthfully hilarious like Bulworth. Instead it's just another forgettable movie. Among the good parts are the priceless cameo by Dan Aykroyd as an Canadian police officer who teaches sheriff Candy how things work in the country; the president quoting Bob Dylan minutes before almost getting blown up; Bill Nunn exposing why blacks are always put in second place, specially movie characters; the broadcast news anchor (Stanley Anderson) informing about the eminent war; Jim Belushi's cameo as a drunk reporter and Steven Wright's cameo. Kind of awkward when you realize the cameos were more effective than the main cast who besides Candy (sadly his last role and one of the most unfunny he ever made), Alda, Pollak, also have Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman, Kevin J.

After all, Canada has massed 90% of its population along the border (they must be up to something!) and the Toronto Blue Jays have won the World Series - twice (and they cheated to do it!) So, Operation Canadian Bacon is launched! This is a great satire that pokes fun at pretty much everything and anything Canada and Canadians, the US and Americans, international relations, arms manufacturers, etc. John Candy was brilliant as Niagara County (NY) sheriff Bud Boomer, who gets so caught up in the anti-Canadians rhetoric being spewed forth from the White House that he takes it upon himself to lead an invasion. Unfortunately, he loses one of his comrades (Honey, played by Rhea Pearlman) who gets arrested in Niagara Falls, Ont. - for littering! To the White House, Honey becomes a hostage. Troops are sent in (and Bud goes too) and the whole thing spirals into a very serious international incident, during which Russia almost gets nuked by accident! Candy was the perfect stereotype of the ugly American - loud, crude and totally ignorant of anything outside his own immediate circle (and pretty ignorant within that circle!) Pearlman and Alda were also quite good, and I enjoyed Bill Nunn as Deputy Kabral, another of Boomer's gang, who gripes about being determined to make Canadians white. There was really no significant Canadian character in the movie, but a brilliant caricature by Dan Aykroyd as an Ontario police officer who pulls Boomer over while he's on his way to rescue Honey in Toronto to insist that the anti-Canadian slogans painted on his truck have to be in French as well to comply with Canadian language laws.I wouldn't say that this was outrageously funny but it was humorous throughout and completely enjoyable. A number of Canadians appear in the cast, and there's some fun poked at the fact that the entertainment industry in the US is so dominated by Canadian actors (surely a plot from up north) and also at some Canadian singers (Ann Murray, Gordon Lightfoot.) There was also a very funny spoof of the tendency of US networks to over-dramatize everything that happens (Operation Canadian Bacon with a crossed out maple leaf being the backdrop for an outrageous anchorman, played by Stanley Anderson.)

One of the few movies that it probably doesn't matter whether on the big screen or at home on the VCR.Canadian Bacon stars John Candy as Sheriff Bud Boomer of Niagara Falls, New York.  The town has recently undergone a recession due to factory closings (a common theme in Michael Moore movies, see Roger and Me)  However, the plants that are closing in this town are military plants being shut down by the President due to the end of the Cold War.  The President is ridiculously unpopular, and he blames it on the the fact that every other President had the Russians to blame for all the nation's problems.  Desperate for an enemy, he finally settles on the Mom and Pop operation up north, Canada.This whole set-up provides for plenty of satire, and belittling humor directed at Canada is both obvious and funny.  A militant intelligence advisor to the President truly thinks the Candians are evil, citing an unfathomable purpose to the Canadian National tower, and all the ways that the Canadians have invented to make the Americans' lives miserable, including the metric system, Celsius, and, of course, Neil Young.Moore is clever in this way because he makes the obvious humor (or, for you Canadians, humour) all directed at Canada, which Joe American is bound to undrestand and find funny.  But there is also a lot of satire directed at the United States which is a little more subtle, yet still thoroughly enjoyable.Particularly funny are the propaganda television ads set up by the president which portray the true evil of Canadians as well.  They cite funny and sometimes actually believable or at least fear-provoking things about Canada.  A grave TV news broadcaster urges Americans to think of your children pledging allegiance to the maple leaf...winter, 11 months a year...Anne Murray, all day, every day.  (Listen closely for an Anne Murray song playing on the radio in the movie as well)By the way, there isn't much to this movie, in terms of story.  The story simply serves as a mechanism to allow Moore to poke fun at both America and Canada.  I rated it about an 8.

Luckily I found it to be just as well-written, severely biting, and hilarious as his past works. While reading some of the older reviews for Canadian Bacon on this site, however, I noticed many had differing beliefs. One poster, for example, attacked Moore's film for criticizing the American military. I love this kind of person, the type who blindly waves a U.S. flag while never once thinking that someone in the White House may actually be thinking more about their own interests than theirs. How dare Moore make fun of our beloved military! Where would he be without them, I ask you? If he was living in another country, he wouldn't be able to say those things! Hey, great point, moron! Then there are those who think Moore is from Canada, which is hilarious. Statements like those just show how little the person knows about Moore and his body of work. Anyway, back to the film itself, which is still very timely in today's society. The opening sequence is a very funny parody of what's been happening in Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan for many years a huge company known as Hacker has recently closed down a plant which terminates thousands of jobs in the local community. The plant was responsible for producing weapons of destruction during the cold war, but now that the Russians have surrendered, there is no longer an enemy to fight. This troubles both the founder of Hacker and the latest White House administration, since without a foe their profits and popularity points go down. So what do they do? They try and convince the Russians to get back in the game, but they quickly realize this will never happen, as their former enemies now only want MTV and other luxuries for their people. One moment which really rang eerie in Canadian Bacon came when one of the President's men suggests going up against international terrorists, only to be denied by another staff member who claims, ...all they do is go around blowing up rental cars! Creepy, no? A similar scene involves a joke about letting loose killer bees, which ended up being used as a phony scare years later by the media. Remember that? It's odd how prophetic Moore can be sometimes. The rest of the film, as you all know, involves a cold war with Canada. The anti-Canadian propaganda stuff in this movie is pitch perfect, from the maple syrup running down the TV screen like blood to the list of Canadian celebrities now living in the U.S. At this point I'd like to address those who claim this movie makes America/Canada look bad. Hey, it's called satire people, and all satire has to come from somewhere, right? America DOES have gun toting rednecks and conniving politicians and corporate members, and Canada IS known for being a much nicer (and cleaner!) country than ours. Get over it, already! Moore's only telling it like it is, whether you want to cover your ears and sing, The Star Spangled Banner while he does it or not. So as I said before, Canadian Bacon is a very funny film which targets certain elements of our country and manages to make a dead on shot.

Perhaps it was only me.One of my favorite parts was to see Toronto as such a clean, orderly and polite peopled city and then on the way home the view of the US city has smokestacks and steam rising from a polluted, ugly mess but the characters are truly happy to see it all again.This movie doesn't have the usual sex, swearing and violence of some intense comedies.  The gun carrying is reduced to just that, and all the shooting happens at inanimate objects. If you want a comedy that you could show with the children around, this is the one.My -favorite- part was in the US control room where the red lights start flashing and the sirens sound and everyone else knows what it means but Alan Alda's character suddenly perks up and glances around, completely blank with a sputtered -- 'what the hell is THAT?!'

Alan Alda was PERFECTLY cast as the President. I enjoyed every scene with him and it is HE who really made the movie. Stephen Wright was also wonderful as a Canadian Mountie.

The movie did of course had its funny moments but the story was quite poorly done.Sorry Mr. Moore but the storytelling within this movie is just below average. Michael Moore obviously tried to make a comedy in a silly style but he just never goes all the way, presumably because he probably was too afraid his message wouldn't come across then. He also tries too hard to make the movie kick against several political issues, for which Moore is of course well known. It however doesn't always work out in this movie and it feels too forced. It also isn't always a good movie to watch since the way the main plot-line is told is highly unlikely. It feels like a too big coincidence all that Sheriff Bud B. Boomer and friends just happen to be involved in basically every aspect handled within the movie. This concept works in often lots of comedies but just not Canadian Bacon because of its quite messy storytelling. It made the movie painful to watch at times.What made the movie still perfectly watchable for me was its cast. John Candy, Alan Alda, Rhea Perlman, Kevin Pollak, Rip Torn, Kevin J. O'Connor, Bill Nunn, G.D. Spradlin, James Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, this movie has a true amazing comedy cast. They really uplifted the movie in my viewing experience. This was John Candy's last released movie and even though its not his best role out of his career, it's still a worthy one.It's silly concept and story also makes this movie worthwhile to watch in parts. It's of course quite funny to have a story involving America creating a sort of new cold war this time with Canadia, in order for the president to get reelected. It's even funnier to notice some parallels to the real world this present day and the Bush administration. So saying this movie is completely ineffective won't be fair. It also does some good job at times poking fun of American society, as well as the Canadian and all of their stereotypes. Of course Moore mostly kicks against the gun control, something he did of course much better and more effective later on in his documentary Bowling for Columbine, for which he won an Oscar.It's a watchable enough film, though you probably can't help ending up being slightly disappointed with it.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Eerie","Date":"11 July 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" To be honest, this movie isn't that good as a comedy.

While his documentaries have received criticism for crossing the line and being self-indulgent, this movie does neither, and is a perfect medium for Moore's political views. He takes swings at corporate America, the first Bush administration, and America's gun culture, but in a way that is more palatable for mainstream audiences. Combined with a superb cast (including a performance by Alan Alda that evokes Peter Sellers), this is a hilarious movie that stands the test of time.

His premise that the good old USSR wasn't so bad (note the Peace through Fear Since 1947 signs in the factory the President visits) runs parallel to his position today that Al Qaida isn't such a bad bunch of chaps and that, in Moore's words, there is no terrorist threat.

His 9/11 is the perfect example of this. His documentaries are more an attempt at satire than a real truth seeking documentary. One of the main reasons I do not care for his documentaries is that he offers no solution for the problem he is investigating. He does that for a reason as both sides of the debate would have to be explored and the facts he has hidden would have to come to light. Some people consider his films the whole story and all the facts and that is a very sad statement of the intellectual of these people.I hope one day, when he is not the darling of the left, he will return to satire like Canadian Bacon and his TV series.

It is kind of sad when South Park can do a better movie about invading Canada than Michael Moore. He really should be ashamed of himself for claiming to be a film maker after making such a horrible piece of dreck. This film was just a terrible from start to finish.

For such a talented actor, he did so many bad films.  This film does not make Canada look good.  I was insulted at how stupid this film portrayed Canadians and Americans.  The problem is there are people on both sides of the border that behave like this film. The thing is this film was written by a Canadian.  Is this what he thinks of his fellow Canadians?  Canadians always seem to write good scripts and this is what this film is lacking.  The problem is the people who made this film show how silly Canadians can be.  2/10 "},{"Title":"Should have been burned immediately!!","Date":"7 October 2001","Score":"9 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  WARNING SPOILERS!!!!!This movie is awful.  Any Canadian who watches it and likes it should have their heads examined.  Don't give me that it's just goofy political satire crap.  The fact is, they start insulting Canada before they consider a cold war with Canada (i.e. the hockey game What's with the flag, is that some kind of weed?)  Aside from the meaningless anti-Canadian jokes, the jokes are pretty dumb.  The only part which cracked a smile from me was when they were (trying) to sing Born in the USA.Bottom line, don't waste your time with this highly offensive claptrap. This should have never been marketed as John Candy's final movie.  By the way, he was Canadian.

But instead, I saw ugly stereotypes of americans, (isn't moore american?) viciously insulting portrayals of our military (rip torn in the idiotic role of a warhawk general)and bland, predictable humor. I was shocked at how americans were shown as gun toting, moronic, bloodthirsty simpletons, who like to pick fights with people. I also could not believe the manner in which the military was made fun of. I think that Moore should remember that if it weren't for the brave men & women that serve our country, his freedom to abuse the first amendment would not be so free. Maybe I am overreacting, but I found this movie insulting and degrading, and made me lose all respect for michael moore   "}]
