The plot is cut-and-dry (the little plot that exists), but it works out nicely as a comedy, mostly due to Leary's funny dialogue and humorous arguments between him and Bullock.  I think Bullock was miscast, though.  She did an OK job, but her accent drifted many times.  If you like Leary, you'll probably have a great time.  I especially loved the scene where Leary was going fishing and he shoots one of the fish.  Then he cooks it up, serves it up to Bullock and she spits out a bullet.  That was classic.  But for non-Leary fans...you might not enjoy it as much.  I don't consider him an acquired taste, but his foul-mouthed banter doesn't appeal to everyone.

Shot in scenic Nova Scotia, the backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous, and Bullock and Leary have great rapport that makes their rocky relationship very believable. FBI agent Yaphet Koto is along for the ride in a role similar to the one he essayed in MIDNIGHT RUN. Leary co-wrote this, In a manner reminiscent of Donald Westlake -- which is a very good thing, if you know who Westlake is. If not, look him up. Leary is consistently Leary (maybe he was born a fully developed adult), while Bullock in 1996 is growing into the superstar that we know today. She's playing a role that might have been Julia Roberts' a few years before, as she did in several other pictures prior to SPEED and MISS CONGENIALITY, which she made her own.

Perhaps they expect a Citizen Kane or a Godfatherevery time they step into a theater.  Great movies are few and farbetween, and about the best you can usually hope for is acoherent tale told in an entertaining way.And that  Two If By Sea certainly is.  I give it 9 out of 10 for itshilarity, subtle performances, niceness, great scenery, and overallexecution.  It's a warm movie filled with lots of really zingy littlefunnies.  It never strays far from its agreeable theme of true love,and when it does it takes delightful tangents into  pure slapstickgoofiness, devastatingly piercing pricking of the neuveau riche,adolescence, and even the plight of the city dweller who thinkshe's out in the country (as when a terrified Leary draws a .38 on atame deer).  You have to admire a director who can take as manypotshots at life as Airplane! does, and still stay within the contextof a story as cohesive as this one is.Actually this is one of Denis Leary's finest hours.  He portrays aguy who gets along in life by being tough and irascible, although atheart he's hard pressed to cope with the world in general andcompletely confused by love.  Sure his character comes across asgrating -- it's supposed to.  But if you can't see past the facade tothe nice guy underneath, you're not much of a moviegoer.To his excellent work the director adds Sandra Bullock's character,who is just enough not satisfied with a simple, linear life to throwLeary into one tailspin after another.  Their chemistry is oftenprickly, but always centered around the movie's core theme.  And ittakes real talent to portray her part with the touch of frustration shehas, without coming across as a bitch.  Bullock impressed me byachieving just the right tone.And in the end, what more could you want?  The good guys all findways to win and the bad guy loses his claim to fame and goesdown in flame, blame and shame.  Whoooeee!

They play thieves who are delivering a rare expensive painting to their boss. After losing police they shack up in a deserted house. Bullock begins to question her lifestyle and is charmed by another man. Leary does everything to prove his loyalty. Director Bill Bennett does a stylish job but the screenplay would make better toilet paper. Leary makes an attempt to learn other skills that don't involve cheating, stealing and robbing but he soon must stand up for his relationship. Bullock wants out of the unlawful lifestyle yet is easily charmed by deceptive males. We hardly care about this. The ending is hardly believable and makes one wonder what was learned. Supporting roles are lousy and include Stephane Dillane as the stranger trying to court Bullock while having other plans in mind. Unfortunately those plans didn't involve kidnapping her and escorting themselves to the set of a superior film. The role is standard and predictable, and Yaphet Kotto is wasted.

Generally the presence of Yaphet Kotto in a film is enough to spark my interest; prior to seeing this film, Bullock had also begun to have that sort of status for me. She is excellent two or three films, but hasn't done much since Speed which really merits attention. My brother, who is in the film trade in Hollywood, told me Bullock had fired her manager or agent, after drawing lots of attention for a few successful roles. Apparently this agent was the one who selected roles for Bullock which best brought her charm to the screen. Maybe she felt too stereotyped as America's Sweetheart or the next Audrey Hepburn -- I don't know. But her business sense, her apparent lack of concern about being given poor roles or stupid and disgusting lines in them, especially in this movie -- have completely destroyed my interest in almost all recent films she's been in.
