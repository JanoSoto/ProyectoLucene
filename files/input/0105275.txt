Even though it was filmed in 1992, it has the look a an early 80's film. I defy you not to think about A Clockwork Orange as you watch it.Some people have said that the film glorifies skinheads. I would have to ask those people, WHAT FILM WERE YOU WATCHING? This film presents skinheads and their society and says this is the way it is. It does not glorify, nor does it jump on a soapbox. Not to tip anything off, but by the end of the film I don't think there are going to be too many people saying being a skinhead is a wonderful life. In fact, I think that is why the film is so good. The subject matter is not black and white, it is very gray. Skinheads exist for a reason, they do things for a reason. The reasons might sound immoral to us, but the world is made up of different types. In fact, most of the movie deals with Hando (Russel Crowe) trying very hard to hold his skinhead bunch together. However, the destructive nature of the characters is  bringing about the destruction of their lifestyle.The performances in this film are great. In particular, Daniel Pollock is great as Davey. I was very saddened to hear that he died right after this movie. He is often silent during the film, but his facial expressions are very powerful. For anyone that is interested in examining some of the darker groups that wander around this world, Romper Stomper has a very interesting one for you to look at.

It tells the story of Hando (Crowe) and his best mate Davey. Both are Skinheads in the Melbourne area, 1980's. Hando and Davey's lives revolve around collecting Nazi relics and attacking Orientals that have chosen to live in Australia. The two are very tight and big believers in the cause, keep Australia free of outsiders. However, when a girl enters the picture, one will start to see that life is more than just mindless violence and the other will go mad as he sees that his small group of Skins cannot change the fate of his country. This film is not preachy and does not come across as black and white. Both Hando and Davey have positive and negative traits. Instead, the picture tries to show what motivates Skins in doing what they do. The film has some violence, but only in attempt to show how pointless violence is. In my opinion, this is Crowe's finest performance. Moreover, the actor that played Davey is brilliant as well (sadly, he died shortly after the film was finished). If you want to see an excellent historical lesson about hate and how it destroys, see Romper Stomper.

On the contrary, it gives an excellent picture of what happens when powerless people try to find some control over their lives. Nazi-ism itself is scapegoating and blame disguised as fascism, and this movie uses it to paint a picture of desolation and desperation.White power and immigrant-hatred are not what this movie is about. It's about friendship and the need to belong to something. Russell Crowe's Hando is powerful - I couldn't take my eyes off of him. Hando uses that magnetism to draw people into his ideology, thus creating control and power for himself. Things begin to unravel when Gabe, the girl who comes between Hando and Davey, throws off the hold Hando has enjoyed over his little crowd. Remember what Orwell says Absolute Power corrupts absolutely? Well, so does arrogance. Arrogance and the lack of respect for one's fellow man, regardless of race or creed, are key players in this plot.I wish there had been more of Davey (Daniel Pollock) in this film, and I'm sorry to have learned of his real-life suicide in the weeks after it's completion. I recommend this film to people who are interested in how poverty, ignorance, and powerlessness change people into strange earthly demons capable of indiscriminate violence.

Nazism? Sounds interesting truism.What they lack in vision (with the exception of Davey and Hando, who are bestfriends and the core leaders of the group) and reasoning they make up for in compulsive, frantic rioting and clumsily lashing out at the gooks- the Vietnamese people who they believe are contaminating the purity of their all-white community.For a veritable walking time bomb, Rusell Crowe as Hando the gang leader is super charming and hot. He exudes raw, magnetic power- he's exactly the kind of guy that could skin a cat alive without the pussy knowing it. Add some dangerous visions in his mind- and you have a frightening body count of dead gooks.I guarantee that you will never find a dull moment in this movie. The plot just tightens; and you just pity these poor, insecure, hapless but blustering, armed kids. Helen, sexually harassed by her father and another misfit, is bewildered and tender- and she pulls the story together, right when there's no more sympathy left for Hando. The wide shots of the frenzied fighting capture the pulsing desperation of the moment/s; and the music video to skinheads skinheads is a classic- one that Quentin Tarantino probably envies.The twisted ending is ferocious and perfect. It's actually a love story set amidst a society fuelled with hate and boredom and angst; or perhaps it's just a story about three lost souls navigating their squalid community- caught up, vindictive against societal ills (broken families, having no future, wasted lives looming ahead), eager to lay the blame on something, ready to embrace any brotherhood or credo that will give authenticity to their defiant rage.

It makes fine observations while not crossing the line, and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head, the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence.The major asset of Romper Stomper is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly credible in this role it's only because, despite his tattoos and menacing physique, he simply looks too intelligent, too complex for a Skin-head. A real Skin-Head, as I imagine it, would be nothing more than a brain-dead, inarticulate brute, with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his cover.But this is no dumb reality-show, and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence - there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader, so he has some degree of intelligence; the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly the fascination of violence.By the end of the movie, I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better role-models. Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else &#x96; for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on nature vs nurture. However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make Romper Stomper an interesting exploration of the mind.

Whereas American History X is obviously anti-racist, Romper Stomper is not and there in lies its greatness. In all fleeting appearances Romper Stomper seems like a romantic tale for racist skinheads but in actuality it is a tragic love story between societal outcasts, two of which happen to be skinheads. In context the film is a commentary on humanity, friendship, and love. The skinhead aspect of the movie is technically trivial in comparison to the love triangle of the three main characters. I won't go as far as saying that Romper Stomper carries the same weight as a Shakespearean tragedy but the comparison is valid. Those growing up in urban regions would quickly discount that statement due to an inability of seeing past the political overtones of the skinhead theme but the truth is that a significant proportion of the world's population can at least identify with Hando and his friends. Thus the only two ways of really appreciating this movie is either by being a racist skinhead or by seeing beyond that issue and examining the relationship between Hando, Davey and Gabe which happens to be brutally honest and human in my opinion. The score is excellent if not unintentionally distracting from the theme of the movie. The acting is extremely brilliant as well as is the cinematography which is appropriately gritty. Bottom line is do not read too much into the skinhead aspect; attempt to understand the characters as human beings first and skinheads second and you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.

Though Pollock could have potentially become a recognisable actor, tragically his life ended prematurely shortly following this film.Generally, like a great many Australian pictures, Romper Stomper is edgy and raw, and the content of the film is fairly uncompromising in its violent and sometimes graphic detail (read nudity).

It just presents these young white Australian guys who don't like the increasing presence of Asians, chiefly Vietnamese.  Interestingly, after the opening subway scene we don't even see them doing much racializing, they just go about their grubby little lives.  All that really happens is that eventually one of them dies.  There's no catharsis, no great lesson learned, the surviving characters stay locked in their limited lives.  Which maybe is the point any ism to which one subscribes is ultimately a kind of box.  One may freely take this lack of freedom to the grave.  The rest of the world goes on with it's business.Then-unknown Russell Crowe steals the show as Hando, the most radical Skinhead.  Crowe has a kind of Dennis-Hopperesque quality, the ability to convey menace while seeming almost preoccupied.  His American roles have required him to interact with large numbers of characters, e.g. Proof of Life, Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, in which he levels his Richard-Burton-laser gaze at all and sundry and flexes the occasional muscle when necessary.  In Romper Stomper he's mostly isolated; his Hando has elaborate tattoos that only he and a couple others ever get to see.  The shortness of his fuse makes his time bomb tick all the louder. In a scene where he tries to explain his views to a mate while doing pull-ups, it seems a shame that if Hando had only a little more insight into himself, he'd grasp how he's wasting his life.  Certainly there's no one around him who'll point that out to him, for various reasons. Americans should watch this partly to remember how horrible American History X was in comparison.  That latter flick DOES try to explain everything about the Skinhead played by Edward Norton and thus falls into a trap of it's own making.  When Norton's character says about blacks Slavery ended 130 years ago, when are these people going to get their act together? it sounds like a not unreasonable question, especially since blacks are also seen doing bad things.  But the point they should be making is that it's INDIVIDUALS who do good or bad.  In a neighborhood that's almost entirely black, of course most of the criminals will be mostly black, likewise most of the victims.  Romper Stomper cleverly steers clear of all that.Excellent use is made of a certain prop, a World War II era SS knife, without getting too allegorical with it.

Then when it came out on video, my group of friends watched it and loved it so much that they got themselves a copy of it to watch it constantly. The video then went missing after somebody lent it to their boss.When I first watched Romper Stomper, I watched it through the eyes of a lout, and thought that it was cool. This time I watched it as a piece of literature and suddenly saw that it is a superbly crafted film with very deep characters. The film revolves around a gang of skinheads who live in Footscray, an industrial suburb in Melbourne. The leader of the gang is Hando (Russel Crowe), a neo-Nazi, and his side kick is Davey, a more quiet and passive skinhead. One day in the pub they meet Gaye, a young girl who just left her boyfriend and is looking for excitement, so she hooks up with Hando.It is the characters that really make this movie. The first thing to look at is Hando, because his personality makes up the personality of the whole gang. He is the leader and what he says, goes. Hando is a nativist, meaning that the only native race in Australia is the WASP, the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. His neighbourhood is being bought out by Vietnamese and this he resents. He believes that Australia is a white nation and the Asians are corrupting it, so they make a habit of beating them up. Hando is fighting a war that he cannot win, because the more he attacks the Vietnamese, the angrier he makes them, and in the end he brings the whole community onto his gang. This riot signals the beginning of the end of his gang because up until that moment they have not been defeated.Hando suffers from a fatal flaw, and that is his obsession with his hatred of anything Asian. At the opening of the film, he encounters a couple of Asian girls at the railway station, so he and his gang beat them up. This is not a noble thing to do, but rather the result of an obsession. The furthest extent of his flaw is during a break-in he sees a Japanese car, so he turns his mind from the job at hand to totally decimate the car. This leads to the owner of the house getting to them with a gun forcing them to flee and leaving all of the stuff behind.Hando is the ultimate in self-centeredness, yet he refuses to acknowledge his flaw. When Gaye exposes his flaw to him, instead of listening to her, he throws her out. In fact, his obsession leads him to severely disrespect the woman that is supposed to be his girlfriend. When she cooks dinner, instead of eating it, he attacks it for being Italian and throws it away. Yet without his gang, Hando is nothing. As we watch his gang diminish, we see the once proud and menacing figure that is Hando also diminish. His clothes become more ragged and his appearance more desperate. The scene when he arrives in Davey's bedroom after his gang are all gone depicts a man who has lost everything. And his final death, by the standard issue Hitler Youth knife, is fitting for one who followed the world view of Adolf Hitler. Even then the knife was made in 1944, at a time when all was lost for Germany.Davey is Hando's best friend, yet rather than equals, he is the one that follows Hando everywhere. Hando treats Davey as a child, and in a way he is. Davey does not have the burning passion that Hando has, instead he quiet and very submissive. Yet Hando realises that he needs Davey's friendship. He lets him go easily, yet when his gang is all gone, he comes crawling back to him. Davey claims to be Hando's best friend, yet there seems to be little interaction between them until right at the end. Hando does father Davey, as seen when he makes Davey comfortable after finding him passed out on the stairs. Yet it is the scene of the beach when we really see the finest interaction between Hando and Davey.Hando is the one who has all the words, and his words work to sink deep into Davey's minds. Hando believes that Davey needs him and tries to convince him to dump Gaye, for she is only a burden too them. It is not Davey that needs Hando but rather Hando that needs Davey. As mentioned earlier, without his gang, Hando is nothing, and it is when his gang is gone, Hando comes crawling to Davey to plead with him to join him. Even then, Hando kills a service station attendant to force Davey to stay with him. Davey is easily manipulated and persuaded, and it is because of this that Hando wants him around because he knows that Davey won't speak back to him.Romper Stomper is seriously a superb movie. The script is finely crafted and a lot of thought has been put into the characters, their relationships, their traits and their flaws. Some have claimed that there is a lot of Hollywood sensationalism in the movie, but after watching it recently I am very much inclined to disagree. This is not a Hollywood movie, nor is it a movie exploring the world of Skinheads and squatters, but it is the tragic story of Hando who, through his obsession, brings destruction not only onto himself but onto all of his followers.

Yet in reality this is, in essence, a simple tale of good versus evil - the damned versus the saved - Hando versus Davey.***SPOILER*** The lines may be blurred, perhaps rendered almost unrecognisable, by their mutual racism and violent tendencies, but once Davey finds an opportunity for possible redemption, in the form of Gabe, it is this story's aim to establish whether he can overcome the true evil that personifies his best friend.I appreciate that Russell Crowe's Hando may be the stand out character for many, but for me Daniel Pollack's wistful Davey, and his inner battles, provide the performance of the film and the hook upon which the storyline demands our sympathy.***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** Without meaning to sound patronising, the extent to which Pollack's performance was driven by his own demons, the demons that led him to take his own life before the film was released, is hard to know. Yet the anguish, uncertainty and complexity of Davey's outlook provided a more pleasing study in disaffected youth than that of Hando's who was essentially an unreconstructed thug with empty pretensions towards intellectualising his violence.***SPOILER*** You are always aware that Hando is heading in one direction only - self destruction, but the flicker of self-awareness in Davey, crystalised by his burgeoning love for Gabe, helps us, the audience, to forgive him his sins (which are plentiful).***SPOILER*** Hando is beyond help, but in comparison Davey is 'redeemable' and thus the film cleverly allows us to feel comfortable with our affection for a man who we have seen perform wicked acts.(There are few better examples of this comparison than the two sex scenes - the first, between Gabe and Hando is a soulless, expression of dominance; an almost brutal act, lacking any affection. But when Gabe and Davey are together we are presented with the entwining of two people expressing nothing but love for each other.)***SPOILER*** And thus, by the time we reach the denouement on the beach, the battle lines have been drawn and we are in no doubt as to where our affections lie. We are presented with a Shakespearian tragedy as Hando demands loyalty from his friend and the destruction of the supposedly malevolent Gabe.That Davey rejects Hando's pleas is the film's great 'Rocky' moment - we are cheering for him! and yet we have conveniently disregarded his devilish acts in the films earlier scenes.***YEP, IT'S A SPOILER*** Hando's death is the only possible outcome and it duly comes - but to what extent Davey is now free is questionable. His involvement in a string of violent crimes would have to catch up with him.Nevertheless, in the purest sense he has triumphed by rejecting the evil of Hando and embracing his more honest desires for Gabe. He has broken a wicked cycle and for that has allowed whatever latent morality he may possess to overcome his worst characteristics.***SPOILER***Davey - the lesser of two evils? Nope - in this context he is a force for good and our forgiveness and empathy is complete when Hando dies.

Years down the line I finally get around to seeing Romper Stomper, and that actor is international superstar Russell Crowe! And he does give quite a excellent performance (on par with everything he has made since). Actually everyone gave very believable and riveting performances with the very controlled and well timed direction of Geoffrey Wright. Overall the production and story are above par and it is very easy to get sucked in to everything. But I had to wonder what the overall purpose of the main characters being neo-nazi skinheads was. Although there was a sense of futileness to all the racial violence happening, there didn't seem to be a statement at the root of the film. The story starts as a look at a pack of skinheads and ends as a human story of two friends and the girl that finally helped the follower become the leader in their relationship. The fact that they were skinheads did not seem to have relevance to the core story, the two friends could have been mere thieves, part of a gang or even wall street moguls and the story could have taken the same route. So in the end I was left wondering, What was the point of adding the racial card if there was no statement being made? Nevertheless, Romper Stomper was a riveting movie that portrays the self-destructiveness that results from hatred with some excellent performances by the leads.

The fact that there's something inversely fascist in this by screaming  Fascist  or  Nazi  at someone doing something rabidly oppressive such as paying money to watch a film is lost on some people . At least London allowed the film to be shown unlike a few councils in Britain such as Glasgow city council who outright banned the film from being shown in cinema chains in the city . I'm guessing the thinking behind this is down to it being used as a recruiting campaign for far right groups ? Remind me what scene in this film promotes fascism in any way ? Now that the ill founded controversy has died down ROMPER STOMPER is the film best known for a power house breakthrough performance by Russell Crowe who at the turn of the century was quite possibly the best known movie star in the world . It wasn't just his acting he was known for and would often make headlines being a little too free with his fists and seeing Crowe in this movie all those years ago led me to ask if Crowe wasn't using too much acting skill as a violent thug . As good as Crowe is it's the performance of Jacqueline McKenzie and the late Daniel Pollock that probably stand the test of time Despite the memorable performances ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty and unconvincing movie . It tries to be a gritty realist film but its constant use of an Oi soundtrack negates this . The production team didn't want to pay royalties to Neo-Nazi bands such as Skewdriver so that's two fingers up to both the Nazis and the anti-Nazis so congratulations to the production team for that . But the storytelling is a bit confusing it's got elements of a doomed love triangle but is in no way a twisted love story . Indeed the characters are difficult to buy in to and give the impression they're mere plot devices there to build up a story and have their world collapse around them as things go wrong . Perhaps this is why I thought the film tries to make a point of family and belonging but everything ends up becoming so confused that it's difficult to see what the point the film is trying to make . It's a good film in parts and you'll remember certain scenes such as the  fourth Reich fighting men  chase but at the end of the day ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty film "},{"Title":"Crude, Ugly, Brilliant, Flawless","Date":"21 September 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" In the decaying urban squalor of Melbourne's back streets a gang of racist Skinheads live out a crude existence of nazi-rock parties, heavy drinking, and brutal assaults on immigrant youth. Led by psychotic neo-nazi Hando, the gang comprises Davey (his best mate), Bubbs (the underage mascot), Sonny, Cackles, Brett, Champ and Luke, along with their female 'camp-followers' of two dubious Goths and some tough-talking Skin-Girls. Several scenes (one presumes intentionally) eerily remind of A Clockwork Orange which adds marvellously if not chillingly to its overall tone, although the film is otherwise a piece of no holds barred realist cinema.When Gabe, a lost soul and deeply troubled young woman, strays into a back-street pub claimed by the gang as their hangout, the subtle cracks in the dynamics between Hando and Davey gradually unfold. As no-less a violent and unrelenting racist as Davey is, he is evidently a gentler more mild personality than Hando, and is to a large extent in Hando's shadow. As Gabe gets it on with Hando becoming the gang's latest auxiliary, Davey is smitten and his interest is not lost on Gabe, who for her part at least encourages his attention&#x85;if not craves it.Then a vicious attack on two immigrant men, which starts as an impulsive act of 'political activism', becomes the beginning of the end for the Skinhead gang and for the relationships between Hando, Davey and Gabe. After a terrifying mass fight against an overwhelming mob of Vietnamese men, which towers leagues above anything I've seen in any other 'gang film' and which arcs the entire middle of the movie, the Skinheads end up well and truly on the run. Resorting to basic human instincts and no longer able to conceal their worst personal defects (or in Davey's case, his affections for Gabe), the remnants of Hando's gang try to survive the dire circumstances their actions have brought upon them, and as they continue a catalogue of lawless deeds against those perceived as their enemies, the proverbial time-bomb continues to tick. One by one they fall, as Hando's once iron grip slips to sub-gutter (quite literally in one scene) leadership, forcing Davey to abandon his 'idol' and attempt to go it alone. With a tragically magnificent finale, this is a timeless story which delves into the raw and ugly of our times.

Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless. When learning of this, the skins can't get away fast enough and the two races go war to war. The skins, totally outnumbered, realizing they've overstepped their mark, flee, and take refuge in a warehouse, occupied by one of the skin's girl's ex's. The dialogue that transpires, between the girl conning her way back into this building, is actually a humorous relief, in the wake of the intense ten minute battle between the two races, that passed where some real nasty blood was shed, some of the most realistic use of blood, I've seen. I liked the direction this movie took from here. It almost made me take up using Campbell's sauce again. The sex scene with Crowe doing Mckenzie behind, both naked, was titilating too, almost necessary, putting a light, though not romantic moment to this film. Some of the potent dialogue, here too, is interesting. So is Crowe's extensive tattooed work on his back. I'm almost prepared to believe Crowe won't be able to surpass himself here with a better performance, than in this bold and confrontational film, that I can't believe I first saw over twenty years ago. The way the cops interacted with the skins, granting no mercy, when capturing them, sounded all so true, almost a replica of that exact same scene happening for real. The movie does lose a little of it's fizz near the end, when it comes down to our three players, one skin who doesn't walk away, the other hopefully walking away from all of this futile hate bulls..t for good.

Further complications are caused by troubled, spacey epileptic junkie Gabe (superbly played by the fetching Jacqueline McKenzie), who comes between Hando and his loyal best mate Davey (the excellent Daniel Pollock). Writer/director Geoffrey Wright's dazzling debut feature seethes with a ferocious and unrelenting ultra-kinetic buzz that works over the viewer like a severe jackboot beat-down the frantic pace, in-your-face brutal and unflinching outbursts of hideous violence, stark nihilism, and uncompromisingly downbeat conclusion all add up to one profoundly unsettling, yet undeniably gripping and sometimes occasionally poignant viewing experience. Wright wisely doesn't preach; instead he allows the grim story and no-hoper characters to make the pertinent point that hatred and violence are an end to themselves rather than a means to an end. Moreover, Wright exposes the fear, rage, paranoia, and stupidity that fuels racism with a hard, unblinking clarity that's disturbing and provocative in equal measure. In addition, the performances are uniformly outstanding While Crowe clearly dominates the picture with his forceful turn as Hando, Pollock, McKenzie, Alex Scott as Gabe's incestuous rich father Martin, Leigh Russell as the bitter Sonny Jim, and James McKenna as scrappy little boy Bubs are all just as strong and impressive. Ron Hagen's striking, dynamic cinematography, the terrific thrashy punk soundtrack, and John Clifford White's jangly, rattling score are all fine and effective. An absolute powerhouse.

And Romper Stomper has much more of an impact on the viewer because of it's extreme realism. American History X takes some of most brutal scenes of all time and just makes them look like silly Lifetime specials by slowing it all down and making everything melodramatic. Romper Stomper does the opposite, it films everything as it happens, making it one of the most disturbingly realistic works I've ever seen. Also, unlike other films about skinheads, Romper Stomper takes a completely unbiased look at their culture. Instead of showing everyone has rude, inconsiderate miscreants and then centering the film on the one person who is above at all, this film displays their culture for what it really is. A realistic look at the skinheads, instead of an over-dramatic look at the struggle one person makes to get out. Russell Crowe is disturbingly natural, fully absorbed and overwhelmingly commanding in his greatest performance of all time. Never have I seen Crowe become a character so well. He completely wraps his mind around this man and scares the hell out of me during his most violent scenes. The soundtrack also plays a vital part to the film. It's punk rock, hard-hitting sound really makes the viewer feel like they are with these skinheads and ready, to put it simply, to kick some ass. This all being said, the editing can get pretty sloppy and sketchy at times and the sound (primarily the sounds of the hits in the opening scene) are pretty poor at times. Gabe's story also felt a bit unnecessary, but I suppose it did have key plot points to move the story along. The whole thing with her dad though, really could have been left out. The ending is also pretty terrible. For such a natural, realistic film I wouldn't expect such an annoyingly unrealistic ending.

I remember when it was first released in the UK how the Daily Mail held it up as evidence of the failing moral standards of the nation, and called for it to be banned. They were unsuccessful, and the furore quickly died. Despite the Mail's publicity, the film only did limited business and was quickly forgotten. Chiefly notable now for an early starring role for Russell Crowe, Romper Stomper looks older than it actually is. It looks like it was filmed in the late 70s or early 80s, and the use of 16mm film belies the film's tiny budget.Geoffrey Scott's debut story focuses on a gang of Melbourne-based skinheads who lead lives of aimless violent debauchery. Led by the fiercely intelligent Hando (Crowe), they savagely beat a couple of Vietnamese who have bought their local pub, only to find themselves besieged by half the Asian community and forced to hide from both them and the police. A sub-plot features a love triangle between Hando, Gabe &#150; a rich girl who briefly takes up with the gang &#150; and Davey (Daniel Pollock), Hando's best mate. Some subtle interplay between Hando and Davey, in which more significance is given to what is not spoken between them, provides the convergence of an entire homo-erotic subtext, but also serves to distract both the viewer and the film itself from its main subject matter. As this menage-a-trois is not particularly well-handled, the film suffers badly as a result, and the visceral energy and insight of its first half is lost by the time of its conclusion.The use of music and the lawless street-gang milieu invite comparison with Kubrick's Clockwork Orange but, while there are obvious similarities, Romper Stomper pales in comparison. Crowe leads a cast that deliver surprisingly polished performances and he does well in a role that offers little in the way of character development once we learn Hando's dangerously skewed ideology, but he manages to suggest the intelligence that lurks beneath the brutish exterior with just a brooding look off-screen.Romper Stomper will never be a classic, and will appeal to only a narrow audience but, if it is your kind of movie, it is worth ninety minutes of your time.

The movie jumps around and the story is somewhat vague. Still it's well-directed with some very brutal violent fights and one fairly explicit sex scene. The movie doesn't take sides either. It does concentrate on the skinheads and Gaby, Davey and some of the women are shown as sympathetic characters but the rest are shown as sick, violent sociopaths. This originally got an NC-17 from the MPAA. From what I read, this was given that only because the MPAA thought if they gave it an R rating they would be accused of promoting racism (which is just silly). It now has an R and (from what I can see) there's no cuts from the NC-17 version.Pollock (who sadly committed suicide before this was released) and McKenzie are very good in their roles and the others are too.

The film takes an unexpected turn towards the end by only focusing on the love triangle; and this is perhaps the only love triangle in film history where you hope that all three get killed in the end (or at least have their skulls fractured, and legs torn off). I am not sure whether the director wants us to at least sympathize to a small extent with the shy one and the girl, but he definitely doesn't succeed with me, if that was his intention; there is absolutely nothing redeeming about these characters. The fact that the girl was molested by her father and had a lousy childhood is not sufficient explanation - and certainly a lousy excuse - for her behaviour, if that is what the director was trying to convey. I hope he wasn't, because it's a widespread misconception that skinheads (and other trash) got their behaviour from abusive homes and what not. This is nonsense; if every abused child became a degenerate then at least a tenth of the population would consist of skinheads, serial-killers, and rapists.However, I believe that the film isn't preachy and that the terrifically-directed violence speaks for itself.

Romper Stomper was also notable for garnering recognition for Russell Crowe.Romper Stomper centers on a group of Neo Nazis led by the charismatic and volatile Hando (Russell Crowe). Hando's best friend and second in command who Hando relies upon is Davey (Daniel Pollock, who committed suicide before the film's release). The gang befriend Gabrielle (Jacqueline McKenzie) a lost cause who is a drug addict and is sexually abused by her affluent father. The gang frequently wreak havoc throughout Footscray in Melbourne, Victoria and target the local Vietnamese in the area. Hando and his gang bash up a group of Vietnamese teenagers at the start of the movie with Hando warning one of them, This is not your country. After a violent confrontation with a large number of Vietnamese which sees a lot of the Neo Nazi's brutally bashed and their warehouse set on fire, Hando, Davey, Gabrielle and the remaining members struggle to fight for survival to stay alive and not get at each others throats as well as avoid the police and any further retribution.Though this is one of Russell Crowe's earliest roles, Romper Stomper is definitely one of his most memorable movies, right up there with L.A.

I really fancy sitting down to watch a film about Nazi skinheads, beating up people they perceive as different.' However, just because the subject matter is pretty distasteful, doesn't mean that the film's that bad.Naturally, a lot of people claim that this film is 'racist propaganda' and refuse to watch it. However, after spending just over ninety minutes in the company of these 'Hitler worshipping' Aussie thugs, I can't see that their lifestyle would come across as very appealing to anyone &#x96; even the very impressionable among the audience. You could hardly want to be like these guys.The other thing 'Romper Stomper' is remembered for is Russell Crowe's performance as the main skinhead character. He does play him well &#x96; scarily well. It's amazing that he was able to build what became quite a diverse career on his angry, monotone performance here. Russell and his crew spend their days hunting down 'non white' residents who they're convinced are bringing down the neighbourhood and taking it away from the 'natural' white race. And, when they're not hitting other people, they're also hitting each other while jumping up and down to 'shouty' type skinhead music, spouting the wonders of 'bald-headed fighting men.' Just like 'Trainspotting' was a film about undesirable junkies, this is a film about undesirable skinheads. Neither tells you to behave like those on screen, but both offer a world into a (thankfully) niche group of people and the way they live their lives. You certainly don't have to like what to see to enjoy the film. Just be thankful you don't have Russell and co living next door to you.

It's a movie about racial violence, prejudice, and lives without hope. It's also full of great stomping fight scenes, amazing punk rock, and steaming hot sex. It never sentimentalizes the racist gangs, unlike GANGS OF NEW YORK. Instead it's violent, completely honest, and unbelievably disturbing. It's so ironic that this film features Russell Crowe as an absolutely repulsive villain, yet even here you can see the incredible star power and charisma that was to make him a global superstar in just a few years' time. As Hando, the Nazi Skinhead leader, he's cruel and heartless, yet you see exactly the same kind of strength, the silent aura of authority, that made him such a natural for hero parts down the road. Even when his gang is outnumbered hundreds to one the only thing you see on his face is stern determination and cold resolve. Now I want to talk for a minute about the film's tragic ending. Since this film is more than twenty years old, I don't consider this a *spoiler* but stop here if you don't want to hear about the final scene. Hando the skinhead leader dies horribly at the end. (Again, can that be a spoiler? Did you think the picture would end with Nazi skinheads taking over Australia?) But what lifts this movie above the run of the mill message picture is the nature of Hando's downfall. Instead of being killed in a street fight with Asians, he gets stabbed from behind by his best friend. What makes this image so powerful is that it defies expectations. Russell Crowe plays Hando as a man who is not afraid of death. He doesn't just want to fight the Asian immigrants; he wants to die fighting them. Alone among the gang, I think, he really understands that the fight is hopeless. Again, look at his eyes when they're trapped in the garage halfway through the picture, with hundreds of enemies banging on the door. This is the end Hando wants, and in an ironic sense, it is the end he deserves. The death he gets, stabbed by a fellow white man over a woman, is the ultimate humiliation. And there is irony, authentically tragic irony, in the fact that Davey is the only person Hando really loves, and that he is destroyed, not by his racism, but by his best mate. As he sinks beneath the waves with blood spurting from the severed artery in his neck, Russell Crowe keeps his eyes locked on the horizon, stoic and uncomplaining even in death.Talk about a real master and commander!

They are both in a skinhead gang that squats in abandoned warehouses and beats up Vietnamese immigrants and gays for entertainment and to take back their country. They are a dysfunctional family whose unity begins to crack when Hando brings a new girl into the group. Gabe, a runaway girl, is also from a dysfunctional family, looking to be loved and accepted by her new friends. Davey, who looks up to Hando, also fancies her. Problems begin to surface as Davey starts to think for himself and questions Hando's authority and whether he wants to continue to live like that. This film is very violent right from the start, but it's never gratuitous. It's great to see the Vietnamese fighting back with equal violence, they don't just take it and cower. I think all the fight scenes had to be there to emphazise the chaos the skins live in. The great camerawork translates the hectic violence and grittyness perfectly, the cast and director all did a great job. Russel Crowe as Hando, the leader of the gang, is like a father figure to those boys, who are all followers. They need him to say what's what and where to go and what to eat.They are Lovingly violent to each other when they dance and have sex. It's the only way they know. Showing love for a girl/outsider is showing weakness, especially when she's tainted with epilepsy and incest, as in Gabe's case. Compared to American History X, which  Romper Stomper is compared to a lot, this film handled the same subject matter in a more succesful way. The one who is beginning to change does it in a much more subtle way than the Edward Norton Character, it's not so hollywoodesque in its portraial of the bad guy gone good, and the characters look like regular people, not at all perfect Hollywood-type. Davey still has a lot to learn whereas Ed Norton's Character is now this totally good guy who was just confused by his dad's tabletalk. Romper Stomper Skins live in Filth and Chaos, no parental guidance or love, American History X skins still live with their parents and seem mainly just bored with being nice guys. If you have to choose between the two, choose Romper Stomper.

I really loved the character attributes; I dislike movies which do not have enough character development.  I thought that Russell Crowe, the late Daniel Pollock, and Jacqueline McKenzie did wonderful in their roles.  My praises also go out to Ron Hagen, the cinematographer, and to Geoffrey Wright, the director and writer.  All combined, they accomplished something not many movies can - to be startling and disturbing while reaching inside to display the finer emotions of life.I especially enjoyed Pollock's character, Davey, and his silent attraction for Gabe.  It was not discussed or debated or brought into the open through dialogue, but through the looks he gave her, how he would be such a gentleman towards her even when Hando treated her like a dog.  After watching countless movies where people moan and whine about their relationships that they can't have, it was satisfying to watch a character silently endure his pains.Although Romper Stomper harshly portrays the brutality which these white supremacists are over-flowing with, it also shows that they are people none the less.  And as much as anti-racists feel despise towards them, we are no different then they are.  *Because* we despise them; we feel the same hatred they do.  There is no excuse for that.  And the anger which built up in the Vietnamese being beaten by the skinheads caused a reaction in them, the same as it did in the neo-Nazis.  So where is the difference?The objective view of the movie is what makes it strong, although that was the source of controversy when the movie was first released in 1992. However, I appreciated the middle-ground assessment of the situation.  In the first scene, as the skinheads pounce on the two Vietnamese teens in the tunnel, you feel hatred for them. But as the story progresses, you begin to actually grow fond of some of the characters.  You root for them in the battles.  And then you think to yourself, what on earth is going on - I'm cheering for the skinheads? This disturbing reaction to the movie is probably what caused so many people to slam it in their reviews.  They did not want to admit what this movie had done to them; that is, made them realize that skinheads are just human beings too. "},{"Title":"Chilling and confrontational account of a decline in friendship; well-being and society.","Date":"30 January 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama","Review":" From the ugly, distorted musical score which opens the film to the savage beating in an underpass which quickly follows and all the way through to the chilling finale, 1992 Australian film Romper Stomper is a tough and unflinching watch &#x96; a frank but brutal insight into the spontaneous, sporadic and violent life of a group of young adult skinheads located in the Australian state of Victoria. Thoroughly maligned by people in the past, and thus as a probable consequence, pushing its director Geoffery Wright into somewhat of a directorial abyss for the years since its release; but acting as launching pad for the actor that plays one of the chief characters in Hando, Russell Crowe, the film stands as a stark and uncompromising piece which systematically confronts and engages the viewer on a number of levels.It is indeed Hando whom heads up a group of leather jacket-clad; chain and tattoo sporting neo-Nazis whom maim, threaten, impose and rule whatever self proclaimed turf they have with a fist of absolute iron; unabashed in tearing into anyone not of their kind whom trespass. Whilst Hando is whatever designated chief, or leader, of this gang; he shares the limelight of the film's arc with two supporting characters. These consist of a slightly younger gang member by the name of Davey (Pollock), and a young girl with an ex-drug addict boyfriend and an abusive father &#x96; she's called Gabe (McKenzie). In whatever point of attack is required, the gang are established to be sudden, unhinged and somewhat carefree. Their loitering in and around a shopping centre in the early hours of the morning sees them gallivant, laugh and joke with each other; even mock-fight with one another in what is a scene of brief wrestling which has an accompanying soundtrack of animalistic and distorted sound effects to heighten anxiety and renders the group of a somewhat unnatural ilk. But this aggressive and spontaneous instinct is played out under a very physical, almost homo-erotic, umbrella of bonding the group engage in; something explored in a sequence that sees many of the gang members jump around topless to loud rock music and embrace one another in a knowing manner.Trouble has been brewing for the group since Vietnamese immigrants have moved into the area and bought out places of business over an unspecified period of time, something that boils over when they acquire a local bar which seems to have been adopted by the skinheads as their local place. The Vietnamese are, in their first proper establishment bar the opening underpass fight, shown to be more mild mannered. We first see them in a kitchen; they are peaceful, they are fulfilling a task, they are organised, calm and have some sort of order about them &#x96; they are creating something rather than destroying. When one Vietnamese bursts into the room, agitated and angered at the aforementioned underpass beating, another Vietnamese talks to him and calms him down rather than get additionally agitated and panic, much unlike what the reaction of Hando's gang might have been in that situation had the roles been reversed.The locations that most of the characters, both of the neo-Nazi ilk and native Australian in general, inhabit are old; worn down and disused while most of them are places of an industrial nature. Hando's headquarters, with the place in which he immediately inhabits resembling a sort of Nazi shrine complete with flags and memorabilia, is an old service garage once used for maintaining and repairing now rendered a place of terror in which those that frequent live off Fascist ideals and get involved in terror and violence. This, as a pair of equally young but not so psychotic, delinquents inhabit an old factory; another industrial place of business once used for creation and production soon rendered a den of hatred. This use of mise-en-scene, specifically in the setting, as a series of grey and run down places inhabited by some quite terrifying people render these once loud and proud places of business and production which spawned jobs and so forth aid in getting across the author's sense of despair at what he might perceive the nation has become. In a film that will see most of the characters' lives plus relations deteriorate; the industrial places of business now home to Australia's young and scummy have already run the course to ruin &#x96; all that remains is the youth follow suit.I've read in the past about how people have likened Romper Stomper to Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, and in premise and specific, individual scenes they are onto something. Thematically, Romper Stomper does not bear much resemblance to A Clockwork Oragne &#x96; it has its individual moments that remind us of said film in an underpass beating; an extended and rather disturbing gang war sequence; a scene in which a tramp is harassed as well as a sequence in which the group break into an elderly man's rich, isolated home before humiliating him and trashing the place. However; narratively, the film is everything A Clockwork Orange was right up to the point the respective lead in that film is hit around the face via glass milk bottle. It refuses to journey down a route looking at power and control by way of the state and opts more for a lower-set look at power and control within a group by way of a woman coming between the two most powerful members. The coming together, face to face as we observe by way of a profile shot, of Hando and Davey are the initial signs of the trouble to come. The film is a tough watch, but a lot of the toughness is born out of just watching the world and the relations people have with each other within it completely and utterly fall apart. The film begins and ends with shocking individual acts of antagonism; in-between, it has our full attention the entire time.

Slowly, the bigots are reduced in number, owing partly to the counteroffensive from the Vietnamese and partly to their own inner turmoil, as an auburn-haired femme from a broken home lends a distracting hand, leading to tragic results.The movie is a pretty rough look at the inner politics of hate gangs. Crowe and his crew have a single mission - the eradication of all nonwhites. In their neighborhood, more and more businesses are being bought or started by those of Asian descent. Hando (Crowe) is a neo-Nazi disciple; he has a copy of Mein Kampf, from which he takes lessons of leadership and purity, and he has a giant Nazi-swastika tapestry in his bedroom. The skinheads are utterly ruthless - they beat, maim, and kill for their cause.But when they roust a Vietnamese nouveau hotelier, all hell breaks loose. Relatives of the victim come swarming after the skinheads at their hangout, waging an all-out war that looks far more realistic than the silly rumbles the Jets and the Sharks used to have. Bloodied and perhaps a little bowed, the racist slugs head for cover.But their headaches are only beginning. Hando isn't the most sensitive guy, after all, so it's not long before his new love Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie) bears the brunt of his tirades. Meanwhile, she starts to have eyes for Hando's best mate, Davey (Daniel Pollock), who's a much quieter sort. Meanwhile, she seems even daffier than they are, no small accomplishment; she has more emotional issues than a Park Avenue newsstand. But she's pretty and different (the other women in the group are Goth goddesses, whereas she's a redheaded vixen, you see, and an epileptic), so the advantage is hers, sort of.A couple of things make this movie watchable the fast pacing by director Geoffrey Wright and the nascent acting by Crowe. You can clearly see the greatness that would develop more fully a few years later. Crowe's Hando is cool under pressure, but ultimately flawed. He's never shown as weak, though, just morally unyielding. That is, when he shouts at Gabe, he doesn't turn around in the next scene and take her back, admitting his error. He's strong willed and misguided, and Crowe perfectly captures all of the character's nuances, right up to the deadly finish.

For instance, first time around I missed noting things like the irony of Davey stabbing Hando with the very knife Hando actually paid for early on in the movie. And then there's all the intentional cheesy references to Kubrick's Clockwork Orange. There are plenty more, but you'll have to pick them out yourself.I'm not looking for documentaries when I watch a movie, however as a teenager growing up in the same city at the same time this movie was made, I find all the shots hauntingly familiar. I recognize the time, the feel, place and era of every city scene. I can even tell the suburbs that certain scenes are shot. I personally feel that capturing an emotion on film rather than just a picture should be worthy of respect in anyone's books. Even the train stations made me feel 'at home' for Melbourne train stations were literally as dark, dank and grotty as depicted in the opening scenes.My only real complaint is the bit character acting in the movie. It is absolutely abysmal. I feel for Crowe, McKenzie and Pollock. I may not be an actor, but from my own job I know what its like to work alongside completely useless twits. Its hard. Very hard. However, to their credit, in the face of adversary, all three acquit themselves in a way that only a true professional can, which probably explains why they have gone on (Pollock excluded for obvious reasons) to better things while the supporting actors are still too embarrassed to even show up as extras on homemade cable TV sitcoms.I wont try and give you rubbish about lighting or cinematography or any other pious aspect that has no business at the consumer end of a movie (as so many try hard hacks on here seem to want to).

It also allowed us to see two fascinating cast members, Russell Crowe and Jacqueline McKenzie, give their personal perspectives in working on this project.Tragically, before these interviews and the film's premiere took place, the third lead, Daniel Pollock, performed an ultimate sacrifice taking his own life.What Brando's The Wild One did for his early career, Romper seemed to do for Crowe's. Both films offered a lot of violence, and little supportive philosophy. Both seemed ambiguous and inconclusive. Yet, Wright points out that he feels it's unlikely that these films resulted in any particular antisocial behavior that wouldn't otherwise have taken place. (One notes these interviews took place years before Columbine.)The film does put the audience inside the gang, and depicts its members more into pursuing baser adrenalin rushes and youthful excitement than political ideologies.But it takes the DVD extras to put things into a more cohesive perspective. Wright feels that his film demythologized the skins, thus draining the groups of their mystery. He noted a decided drop in such activities following the release of his movie. I have no basis for an opinion on this, one way or another. What I do get is a very driven project, which for several years and months, respectively, totally consumed its writer-director and hard working cast.It's a film that certainly does move, and puts its young actors through very demanding physical paces.

This movie was made five years before the similarly-themed 'American History X' and contains what is easily Russell Crowe's best performance as Hando, the psychotic leader of a group of skinheads. They usually gang up on one or two of the Vietnamese in town (who they believe have taken all the jobs), while appropriate punk songs play in the background. But after one attack too many, the Vietnamese join together to turn the tables on their attackers. The skinheads are shown terrified and crying (except Hando, of course) in their hideout, which the Vietnamese tear apart in a scene that looks like something from 'Night of the Living Dead.' Another memorable scene is the party montage, which shows all the chaos of a skinhead party in only a minute or two. A new girl, Gabe, becomes Hando's girlfriend, although it is obvious later on that his skinhead friend, Davey, likes her too. There is a chilling scene where Hando sits with Gabe and reads her lines from Hitler's 'Mein Kampf.' She wants to become part of the group so she lets the skinheads loot and vandalize her father's house (she also has a personal reason for doing this). This scene recalls Alex's attack at the cat lady's house in 'A Clockwork Orange' (a film which is definitely one of the major inspirations for this movie).

This is not a propaganda film that bashes the life of a skinhead.  Being a white supremacist is far from a good thing, and the film doesn't in any way try to condone their lifestyles.  It just serves as a wake-up call that people like these are out there, and rather than treating them as one-dimensional caricatures, the director treats them as regular characters.  I mean, drama involves truth.  If it's an exaggeration of truth, it's called melodrama.  The writer/director obviously did much research on the lives on these Australian skinheads, and shows in the film that they have feelings, emotions and love lives like the rest of the people in the world.  It may seem sadistic to many having the skinheads as the protagonists in the story, but how many films have we seen where the protagonists are hitmen (Pulp Fiction)?  Or psychopaths (American Psycho)?  Or gangsters (Goodfellas)?  Are we condoning their lifestyles as well?  Does the increased popularity of The Sopranos mean that we all secretly want to be part of the Mafia? *POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*True, the intentions of these white supremacist groups are anything but pure, but neither are the intentions of Jules and Vincent in PF.  Just because they're the protagonists, doesn't mean we have to feel perfect sympathy for them.  As the director expressed in his commentary, the fact that all the characters died--with the exception of Daniel Pollack's character--is punishment enough for their evil deeds.  There are certainly some disturbing scenes, involving the mass beatings of the new flock of Vietnamese in the community (which disturbed me, being half Asian myself; movies like this mainly focus on the group's hatred for blacks and Jews), but they're not done in a way in which the characters are virtually screaming out, I am evil and ruthless.  This is your cue to frown and utter 'Oh, my God.  This is a realistic depiction, not a cinematic depiction. I only wish Russell Crowe's character could've been developed more.  I wanted to know more about why he's so ruthless.  Of course, we don't exactly need a heavy-handed flashback sequence, showing how his father brought him up to hate, but I would've appreciated some sort of background.  Pollack's character I was able to understand a lot more.  He's a bit shy and aimless, and I've seen people like him in everyday life.  He doesn't know where to go with his life, has no friends to make him feel welcome, so he joins the first group of people who treat him respect, as if he's a member of the family.  This is why many young people join gangs.  They don't get much affection at home or by most of their peers, so they feel this is the only way to go.  Pollack's subtle performance made the character all the more effective.  It's sad that he died after post production of the film, because he seemed to have great potential.  The director said something interesting in the commentary.  He said that Pollack committed suicide directly after post-production was wrapped.  It's as if he wanted to finish this movie before leaving this world.  Well, God bless his soul.  Russell Crowe does a fine job as well, though I wish I could've seen the film BEFORE he evolved into a massive superstar.  It just makes it more difficult to forget that's Russell on screen.  But he still did a good job.  The woman who plays his girlfriend, who eventually falls into the arms of Pollack, also does a very good job.  I can see why a film like this would be controversial, but people simply have to look at it more deeply and not through the beer goggles of a propagandist.  As the film concentrates more on the romantic subplot, it gets watered down a bit, but I still regard this as a good film.  Not a great one, but a good one.

It's quite difficult to explain, but here is a small summary of my thoughts on the movie The main plot runs through the small world of a gang of skinheads, lead by the very capable, passionate, and hating Hando, played perfectly by Russell Crowe. As I sat watching, I couldn't help thinking about it, I hated this movie, the violence, the unbalanced chaos, the fugitive style of life, so different from my own. But I couldn't turn it off, I was engrossed in the plight of Hando, his best mate Davey, played very ably by Daniel Pollock, and Gabe, a girl picked up in the Railway Hotel. When one skinhead died, I realized how attached I had become to these characters, surprisingly. The movie was beautifully crafted to portray the world of the skinheads accurately while showing the more human side to them, while bringing the audience directly into the problems and values of Hando's gang. Although I personally didn't like the ending (and lost a $5 bet) I was 100% behind Romper Stomper as a must-see movie by the time it was over. I'm not saying the skinhead way of life and Neo-Nazism is right or wrong, but I think that people should watch the movie with an open mind to be introduced to their world and understand some of the thinking behind it. Besides that, the camera shots are beautiful and consistant throughout the whole movie. Stretch your horizons some, rent Romper Stomper!!

No one tries to make a point, no one shows you the socially accepted wrongs and the rights, only how easily we could all become lost children, searching in agony for affection and belonging, even if it is in distorted ways. No one gives you any lecture, only the sadness that lies deeper than the immigrant or swastika-tattooed skin. The uniqueness of this film lies in its intimate mirroring of the actually causeless violence and vagueness of almost all political or other such groups, leaving it bare of any heroism.The way most films with such themes fail themselves, is on that they end up glorifying somehow the characters they clearly mean to prosecute. Here, there are no heroes.It's a pity that this film is so often compared or put aside with American History X.

In my mind, the word propaganda would not be far off the mark. Upon its release in 1992, Romper Stomper was vilified by a lot of people as being a racist film, even pro-Nazism. The reason for this wasn't because these complaints had any merit. It was because the film shows a side of Australia that the likes of Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin would rather you didn't know about.In order to fully understand the film's relevance, one has to look at Australia as a society for a second. It's a welfare state in which anyone with permanent residence can collect handout after handout from the government, and in spite of claims to the contrary, said welfare system provides more of a hammock than a safety net. Small wonder then that a lot of the native population are out of work and don't really want to work.It is this situation that Romper Stomper is primarily based in. The main characters are all part of a unit of skinheads who consider a life spent collecting welfare payments and beating up immigrants who are willing to work for the money they sit back and take to be virtuous. This is most reflected in the portions of the music that are sourced from real Oi bands, presented here like grisly items in a museum rather than sugar-coated or pushed to the back where they have to be hunted in order to be seen.The claim that this film is racist is turned on its head by the simple fact that it presents a warts-and-all look at the lifestyle of the skinheads. It is made clear that every futile effort they make to destroy their perceived enemy does more to destroy them and their way of life. In another film that explores this theme from a different angle, one character states that the proper question to ask is whether anything one has done has made their life better. The answer for the main characters here is a resounding no.What's even bolder is that the other side of the argument, the migrants who eventually extract a brutal revenge upon the skinheads, are not portrayed in an overly sympathetic light, either. Sure, you can feel their pain and anger, but when they're virtually rioting in the streets and breaking furniture over their enemies' heads, one can't help but noticed what they have reduced themselves to. Both sides fight like animals, and it is generally as animals that they are remembered. It's not that the director wanted to portray his characters as animals so much as he seems to have wanted to ask if violence is really the answer to a social issue.In the end, my advice is to take a look, and then more looks, until you get to understand what was being conveyed in the film. This is the best position to judge it from. With a long list of compelling performances and brilliant photography, this doesn't feel so much like a feature film as it feels like a documentary. And when you're dealing with subject matter like this, that generally means success.

It fell short of being a great movie, however. It is riveting and violent, and has a very dark atmosphere throughout most of the movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing to me. Unpleasant topics need to be displayed unpleasantly. Russel Crowe did a great job as Hando, and was villainous and intimidating throughout the film.The reason that I don't find Romper Stomper to be on par with similar films, such as American History X or even as a great movie is that after many scenes of rather random violence and looting, by the end of the movie you don't care about any of the protagonists and the last fourth of the film is really meaningless to me. The girl, Gabe, is a double-crossing, psychopathic witch, and the fact that she was molested by her father does little to make me feel any sympathy for her. Davey, all of a sudden, decides he loves her (Why? Hard to say... there is little dialog between them until he decides he wants to sleep with her... how sweet?) and goes off to fight Crowe's character to the death after she torches their car and admits she snitched on them.I suppose we are supposed to be happy or find it to be a sweet love story at the end of the movie, but I personally didn't care if all three of them died. Weak character development, and the idea that we should feel like Davey and Gabe are suddenly good or should be cared about makes this a disappointing movie. Had they stuck with the original plot line about racial tension, violence, etc. with or without the American History X-style redemption, it would have been a much more powerful and better film.

It's a little different than others (like say American History X) in that it doesn't seem to hammer the point home that Nazism is bad. It does show how violent the Neo-Nazi skinhead movement is, but it goes more into their mindset and the desperation that these people feel driving them to extremes.In the middle of the film are three characters Hando, the leader of the gang; Gay, a disillusioned young woman who gets mixed up with Hando's gang; and Davy, Hando's right hand man. Hando seems to be the only one of the bunch who truly believes in fascism and tries to indoctrinate his followers. The rest of the gang seem to just enjoy beating up on outsiders (Vietnamese immigrants mostly) and drinking. Gay seems to get involved because she wants to belong to a family. Davy stays in because of his loyalty to Hando, but this is strained as Gay becomes more and more involved with Hando and Davy.There are some very violent scenes, but the violence is only an evidence of the tension. The real boiling point comes from these people watching their beliefs and their world crumble around them. In the end, their lifestyle destroyed what they had (as messed up as it was).Over all, I found the film to be well done and poignant. Although it never really gives an overt anti-Nazi message, the whole film implies that the ideology destroyed these peoples lives.

The lovable skinheads are led by an increasingly hostile Russel Crowe as he makes decision after decision that seemingly worsens their lives&#151;not that they had a lot going for them in the first place.

Some people say that they don't understand how would anyone want to be a nazi skinhead after watching it, some people don't understand how could anyone resist becoming a nazi skinhead after this (I tend to support the latter). The easiest thing is to proclaim this movie as hate-filled. But that's only one side of the coin. The portrayed skinhead community is much like a pack of wolves -- brute, violent and even hateful to their enemies, yes, but at the same time you can't fail to notice the strong spirit of kinship among themselves. Well, and at least that's what I see in this film -- a strong community torn apart by a stranger, a sheep in wolve's clothing. Gabe doesn't belong there, she's a total alien. Yet, she is the one who destroys the group. I do think that's one strong lesson -- skinheads fighting against aliens that are destroying their country, yet failing to isolate alien that's destroying their own community, all because she's kinda nice and a pity to throw out. Also, people tend to say that skinheads in this film are so destructive. Yet, the most destructive person in the entire film is Gabe. Skinheads are destroying, true, but they destroy the things they feel are wrong, much like a surgeon is destroying a cancer when cutting it out. Gabe, on the other hand, destroys simply for the sake of destroying. She believes she's the centre of the universe and, therefore, can do whatever she fancies. Submission to leader, loyalty to kinsmen and race -- those things mean nothing to her. So, to sum it all up -- a great movie indeed. A small summary of all the problems facing White Power movement today. And a hint of what may face us if we don't get rid of the aliens who are tearing our society apart.

It is filmed in 16mm with a hand held camera, giving the movie documentary-style immediacy, and making it very hard for you to distance yourself from the horrific violence of many scenes.Although the movie was criticized when it was released for glorifying skinheads and not taking a moral position against them, neither criticism is really well-founded.  It is clear that the director and the actors made a great effort to get inside the characters, to make them human beings -- however repulsive -- and not simply caricatures.  Still, the skinhead lifestyle depicted is mean, mindless, unromantic and, ultimately, pointless.  For all their posturing, they are mindless bullies, ganging up on isolated victims, and they are completely undone when faced with victims who join forces and fight back with the same intensity.  By the end, all but one of the gang members is in jail or dead, which seems to me to be a pretty powerful moral statement.  The director suggests that, in fact, Romper Stomper did a great deal to de-mythologize and take the romance *out* of the skinhead movement in Melbourne, and he could well be right.The movie is certainly not perfect, but it features a genuinely terrifying performance by Russell Crowe as Hando, the leader of the group, an intelligent, charismatic man totally twisted and misshapen by hatred, frustration and fear, yet capable of genuine affection and tenderness for his best friend, Davey.That performance alone is reason enough -- but not the only reason -- for watching this film.

I didn't find it particularly disturbing, as I've seen that kind of thing many times before, but the sheer repetition and scale of the violence resulted in a dilution of the effect. Violence became the raison d'être of the whole film, leaving nothing of substance to fill the pauses between punch-ups.Secondly, racism. I'm not squeamish or overtly PC, but I found this film went far further than not condemning the behaviour of the skins. Consider this the nazis are portrayed as a group of loyal friends, with high ideals and a mission (reading some user comments, I'm tempted to believe they were convinced of this mission themselves by the end of the film), while the Asians are a faceless, characterless horde, bursting into many scenes like a swarm of flies. Hando gets to make his grisly case to his mesmerised girlfriend, spewing out his racist bile, while the Asians are reduced to being beaten up or - eventually - fighting back. I'm not going to make the irresponsible claim that the filmmakers were indeed racist, but they deliberately steered this film dangerously close to the wind.Thirdly, the plot is extremely weak. Do we really care what happens to these particularly vile people by the end of the film? Is it of the slightest human interest who gets the rather silly, impressionable and immature girl?Far from being intelligent, provocative or revealing, this film is little more than a sick and soulless cartoon.

Don't get me wrong, Trainspotting is still good, just not that original.Geoffrey Wright does a great job and the camera work is awesome too. I read Rolling Stone's review and they called it an 'Aussie Reservoir Dogs.' That is a false label. Maybe it's because I didn't see this movie until after I saw American History X (which I will get into later) that I don't consider that violent. But even comparing it to Reservoir Dogs isn't right. There is no horrible violence or parts in this movie that make you say 'please, don't do that.' There is no ear-cutting scene, no prison rape scene, and no curbing scene. But the film doesn't need any of these things, because the racism (where the true violence is supposed to be seen) is only a subplot.Comparisons to American History X are warranted, but more appropriate would be comparing American History X to this film.

This feeling is enhanced by the coloring of the film (all those hard and cold blues give you the chills, don't they?), which is simply brilliant. Cool part of the films lies in very small things. Take a closer look at the fighting scene behind the bar. I mean, I bet there's only 20 vietnamese guys there, but by the way it was filmed, you get the idea it's virtually hundreds of them. Really well done. But also take a closer LISTEN to that scene. It might just be my imagination, but I could swear I hear the sound of barking, growling, fighting dogs mixed in with the sound. Not as if the dogs were there, but like the fighting skins/vietnamese were the dogs, animals so to speak. Think about that. The closing shot with the credits rolling over it is simply brilliant and beautiful.One thing I must add. Many people have praised this film as a true depiction of the Skinhead-lifestyle. I agree with that, but not comepletely. I know a thing or two about Skinhead-life and I also know quite a few Skinheads myself, people who claim to be skin and are proud of that. Are they racists?

What I mean by this film coming close, well it's like this, I could compare this film to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, it comes so close to being that disturbing, although I believe it falls short in a couple of areas. First, the only explanation for these people to be skinheads is a short little dialog between Russell Crowe and his new girlfriend about Hitler's Mein Kampf. Maybe the director assumes we know enough about skinheads already. There is also a climatic death in this film that left me not caring at all. I won't say who died, but it was a background character. I never felt one thing for this character, it was a total waste. I will say that Russell Crowe is amazing in this film, very intimidating without saying a single word. It's always tough when a film comes this close to being great, I will say that it is a film worth a look and it won't soon be forgotten.

Romper Stomper is not a gang movie and it's not a futuristic parable; it touches on xenophobia, but doesn't explore it in any great depth, and it depicts a scene or two of racial conflict, but despite how it was sold to audiences, it's not an exploration of a hate group, either.No, Romper Stomper is primarily about the relationship between Hando, the skinhead leader, and Davey, his deputy. It falls apart badly in the last fifteen minutes by relying on a hackneyed plot turn and it loses it initial momentum just half an hour in.

No doubt he conveyed exactly what he wanted to convey.  But it was still bad art.

So what kind of film did he make?  You guessed it.

To protect their turf from foreigners (a ridiculous notion in Australia as only the Aboriginals are not foreign) and to live life the way of their choosing.There are many fights including a huge pitched battle halfway through the film and the fighting is shot from a hand-held camera getting you right into the sheer mayhem and brutal aggression.The skins aren't all violent with Davey taking a fancy to Gabrielle, a run-away who they take in and look after. She'd clearly been in a sexually abusive relationship with her father who they later rob and beat up.The end of the film is very weird with only Davey, Gabrielle and Hando (played by a young Russell Crowe).

The viewer is treated to the violence inherent within skinhead culture, replete with Nazi memorabilia adoring walls as well as racist music and random acts of aggression within said group of racists. The difficulty most viewers will have with this however is that there is no side to be taken in this film, with the actions of the main characters deplorable but never understandable. Why is it that these men and adolescents feel the need to isolate themselves within an abandoned warehouse, striking out at the local immigrant (we assume) population? This is something which we never gain the answer to as there is little to no back story provided for the characters, so essentially we are left watching violence against a minority simply for the sake of it. The first parts of the film could possibly be accused of glorifying the actions of violent skinheads, with their attacks on all and sundry within striking distance seemingly portrayed as fun (for them, not for the viewer). This is however not really the intention I assume as the later sections of the film do see the characters encountering difficulties with the law and with each other, leading to the somewhat clichéd reading of the film that you'll get what's coming to you in the end.This however isn't something which makes for a particularly well-rounded or entertaining film. There is no moral message within this film that is delivered with enough clarity to be easily discerned. Yes the characters do eventually have difficulties with their way of life and yes they all meet punishment in one form or another, save for one repenting individual. But so what? The viewer is never made to attach themselves to these characters, to understand them or even come close to empathising with them simply because there is virtually no characterisation for them. Violent racist 1,2,3,4 etc come to sticky ends because of their way of life, but why should the viewer care about this seeing as they know absolutely nothing about them other than that they are an over exaggerated half-formed character. The characters that the viewer is actually given some insight in to never meet with the consequences of their actions, rather moving along with a side plot that sees two characters feuding over another, with the final confrontation of this being largely irrelevant to the rest of the film. How many times has the viewer seen love triangles dealt with far more interestingly and entertainingly and why should this be any better than the rest? The characters that we are given insight into escape from their past in one way or another and the viewer is left with virtually no reason to particularly care about this.Romper Stomper's largely confused and ineffective plot and execution are the reason this film will forever adorn the shelves of skinheads and quasi-racists as a shining example of how great racist violence is, and at the same time be viewed by people of the completely opposite disposition who will site this film as a brilliant example of how racism is futile and can only lead to harming oneself. This is not because the film handles both sides of the argument with finesse and grace or that it sits on the fence, but rather that the film isn't even aware that the fence exists or which country it's in and decides to just do it's own thing and forget trying to have any coherency or meaning.

The notion that the love interest is as destructive as the skins is mildly interesting as are a few other tangents to the film, but mostly this is a series of fights down a steep decline of Australasian civilization.The film does move at a break-neck pace while breaking more than a few necks. Hando crows about not making the mistake that the Abo's made, and that was sort of quizzical to me. Odd that Hando seemed to identify or at least align himself with the Aborigines...and also admit that this land was not truly his people's.Early on some of the fighting between Hando and Dave I thought touched more on the actual inner flame for the skins, an odd appreciation of our bodily existence by the thrashing of our bodies. Mix in the false, youthful sense of immortality and I find that more interesting than just plain hatred swinging out in all directions.And yes I know such hatred does exist...and can be woefully misguided (by goons and by generals). As for the true nature of skinheads as championed in comments here at IMDb, while I know there is some truth to that, at the same time the intentional embracing of a monolithic stereotype to define yourself I think still offends the same core value that racism does. Is it much better to deny one's self individuality rather than someone else??Anyways back to the film, moments like the montage of sex-is-violence-is-domination and the heavy-handed busload of foreigners at the end hurt the film. My favorite scene was the middle Vietnamese brother dispatching the younger for not being useful, just bouncing the pool ball on the table...and then immediately the middle brother starts to bounce the ball... I had high hopes for Davey's fraulein grandma as well (but Daschunds...oh brother...) anything to put these outcasts in a more everyday element.

Confidential, and of course the Oscar for Leading Actor in Gladiator, so it was interesting for me to see one of his earliest leading roles, from director Geoffrey Wright (Cherry Falls). Basically a gang of violent neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia, led by Hando (Russell Crowe), with his friend Davey (Daniel Pollock) as second in command, are not afraid to express their racism by attacking anyone of the Asian community. Gabrielle 'Gabe' (Jacqueline McKenzie) joins them, not after being beaten up by her drug-taking boyfriend, who was hired to do the beating by her sexually abusive and rich father Martin (Alex Scott), and she and Hando form a close blond. The gang are joined soon by friends visiting from Canberra, and they find out their local pub has been sold to a Vietnamese Australian businessman, so they go and attack the owner's sons, and in the situation one of the Vietnamese youth phones for help from fellow community members. They outnumber the skinheads and surround their rented warehouse, but they manage to escape the chaos as the community break in and ransack and set fire to the place, so the skinheads retreat to another warehouse that has squatters. Hando convinces his fellow gang members that they should get revenge against the Vietnamese, starting with the purchase of a gun, and Gabe's suggestion is to burgle her father's mansion, as payback for the years of abuse, she also tells Davey she plans to get away with Hando from the violent lifestyle. Davey has doubts about his current lifestyle and leave the gang, and the same time Gabe dumps Hando, the two of them spend the night together, and she informs the police where the gang is, and the gang are hoarded by police, with the youngest skinhead shot dead, and the rest arrested. Hando was not there at the time though, and even though he does catch Gabe and Davey in bed together, he wants to convince his friend to stick by him, and he does, so they all go on the run, robbing a service station, and the leader strangling the Asian store owner to death. They stop on a beach, and the two male friends have a conversation where there is an argument about the girl, she meanwhile sets fire to the car and admits to them that she called the police. This enrages Hando and he chases her, trying to kill by drowning her in the sea, but Davey stabs him in the back of the neck with a knife, he dies, and Gabe and Davey hug together, while a bus load of Japanese tourists watch from above. Also starring Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim, Dan Wyllie as Cackles, James McKenna as Bubs, Eric Mueck as Champ and Frank Magree as Brett. Crowe gives a great performance as the leader of the gang, he is suitably the most unhinged of the characters, and the support of Pollock and Scott is terrific as well, the raiding of the warehouse is the most engaging scene, but many moments of disturbing exploits of skinhead violence and abuse get you gripped, there are good reasons to put this in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a good drama.
