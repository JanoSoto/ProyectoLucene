All the actors are good with Gallo really bringing his character to life and making you feel for him. Sutherland does a good job of directing and even plays the crazy killer well.The film evens tackles the issue of us viewing these people as cool - not something many do - and challenges us on our admiration of them (even if it is on a basic level).Yes, you seen it before - but that doesn't mean it's totally unoriginal or not entertaining to watch.

They head for Las Vegas to sell the stolen drugs  taking along with them a couple as hostages as they are pursued by both the cops, and the drug dealers associates, who are not best pleased with what they have done. The film moves at a reasonable pace and the acting is good, especially from leads, Gallo, Williamson and an evil Kiefer Sutherland, who clearly enjoys his role as the psychotic Curtis. It's just a shame that the plot seems to run out of steam for the last 20 or so minutes but it does come together again for an exciting finale. Well worth checking out. Sutherland also directed.

Now there was a classic.  That movie was as much a classic as a cult movie as a ground-breaker.  Over the years, we have seen many different versions of this movie, the best one probably being Thelma & Louise (1991).  But after seeing Truth Or Consequences, N.M., I'd say this is the movie that resembles the most this masterpiece.   Donald Sutherland.  Now there is a great actor.  Probably one of the best living actors in today's movie industry.  His small roles in A Time To Kill (1996) and JFK (1991) are just as mesmerising as his big roles like in The Assignment (1997).  If you were to ask me Who do you think will be the next Donald Sutherland?, I would have to say No one.  But after seeing Truth Or Consequences, N.M., I'd say Kiefer Sutherland could become as great an actor as his father is.    As for a great director, well, that doesn't seem to be a problem in Hollywood right for many young directors are developing themselves into great ones and many of the older great directors are still around and while not necessarily becoming one of the greatest directors in the industry, Kiefer Sutherland seems to have as much of an acting talent as of a directing talent.    The movie's story seems very simple and in a way it is.  A drug deal gone awry leaves about six dead people including five cops and four young people on the run from the law.  But as the movie develops, so does the story.  Hostages, undercover cop, drug lords, pregnancy, the Mob, and life on the road all mix together into this delightful mixture of love and guns.  In 1967's Bonnie & Clyde, Warren Beatty was a criminal at the beginning of the movie and always wanted to rob and unfortunately killed people.  In 1991's Thelma & Louise, the two women had gone on a vacation with no intention to become criminals but unfortunately were dragged into that world by a murder involving a would-be rapist.  In Truth Or Consequences, N.M., only Kiefer Sutherland's character starts off as a crazy maniac with the intention of killing people and this is why this movie differs from the two others.  What lead these people to be criminals is an internal action, an action caused by Kiefer Sutehrland's character, an action that could have been avoided contrarily to those of Bonnie & Clyde and Thelma & Louise.  Equally good in the movie are Vincent Gallo and Mykelti Williamson.  Gallo plays the head of the gang, a man with a conscience who has no desire in killing people and whose only goal is to go down to Mexico with his girlfriend (Kim Dickens)and get married.  Williamson has the hardest role of the movie as an undercover drug enforcement agent and must change the way he acts and talks in presence of Vincent Gallo, Kiefer Sutherland, and Kim Dickens.  The cast also includes two very small roles, one for Rod Steiger and the other for Martin Sheen who are both in top shape.  But the movie belongs to the four young people on the run who act out the movie to perfection.

Brad Mirman's plot keeps the action moving, presents twists at every corner and establishes engaging characters.  The real key is both Sutherland's own frenetic performance, his directing style and the chemistry between Kim Dickens and the superb Vincent Gallo.

This little crime caper is fairly derivative of recent Tarantino films, with the discussion of the quarter looking somewhat out of place, Tarantino could have pulled something like that off with snappier dialogue but it just didn't work. Overall though it's a nice little film with some decent action and some cool lines and a nice black convertible car though as is often the case with these little crime capers the ending is pretty weak and predictable. Vincent Gallo put in another decent performance as did Kim Dickens, who you can see more of in a better film that this, The Zero Effect. Also of note was the incredibly pretty Grace Phillips as Donna, she puts in a good performance as the shocked wife of Raymond. The idea of Raymond sympathising/envying the criminals was an interesting one, though I found the transformation to be less than credible.

Some of the Pop Culture references and the extended talky Scenes come off as embarrassing rather than insightful. The Stockholm Syndrome element is also played out with some unbelievable and forced developments.But there are some interesting Characters, the least of which is the DEA infiltrator overacted and annoying, that are engaging enough. The Violence is gritty if over stylized, and is attractive Action Movie stuff with guns blazing and squibs squibbing.Another weakness is the God-Awful Music, from the sappy slow Ballads to the Road Music, it is badly selected and intrusive.

Kiefer really showed the world that he's not only a convincing bad guy on the screen, but also a mean movie maker.The movie builds up towards a long lasting thrilling ending, which will really nail you to your seat. The love story ends painstakingly tragically, while in the old-school gangster movie justice prevails, in true Tarantino style. As a viewer you are drawn to sympathize with the sensitive and intelligent - yet not very bright in planning a robbery - gangster Raymond and his pregnant girlfriend Addy, but as a good citizen you feel relieved that the undercover agent Marcus survives the fire fight.

But only in films like 'Truth or Consequences, N.M.' it becomes clear how much better Tarantino is. 'T o C, NM' has some dialogue scenes that seem to be directly stolen from a Tarantino movie, with just some words changed, so nobody would recognize. Sadly, this doesn't only sound stupid, it does so less fit in this film, it's a disgrace.Consider one of the first scenes where they talk the first time about a quarter. They talk about it for at least five minutes. But nobody seems motivated to talk about it. They look as if they just have to stop there to get this quarter-thing over. The actors seem to be annoyed and impatient, not only because the guy they have to convince his quarter isn't magical is a sinewy guy, but also because they don't seem to say their dialogue from the heart, but from the screenplay. The guy himself is the only one who doesn't seem to be like that. He looks convinced and, well, is annoying. The fact that it's Kiefer Sutherland, who is also the director of the film makes it somehow understandable. But only so far, as we don't understand why he didn't just delete this dialogue.As he should have deleted a lot of other dialogue, of course all of the other stuff about the quarter, and most of the monologues Mykelti Williamson has to stand through. He suddenly starts to say something like 'I once knew somebody who...' and goes on and on for some minutes. This really works when everybody talks like that or when at least he seems to be convinced he wants to say that. But here everyone looks at him interested and we just don't know why. Nobody else talks like that in the movie.It's a quite bizarre movie with quite bizarre characters. Mykelti Williamson for example moves and talks so exaggerated as if it's a comedy. Kevin Pollak has a character development which can be only watched with disbelief. Rod Steiger hops on the screen, screams a bit and is dead. Martin Sheen plays one of his worst and ridiculous roles. And Kiefer Sutherland is the worst of all. He goes so much on the nerves of the audience you want to kill him. It's really quite a relief when he's finally dead. I can't like a movie where I'm glad somebody is dead after I had to watch him for an hour and a half. Not if he's the director.At least we have Vincent Gallo and Kim Dickens here. Gallo isn't only one of the best actors of our time. He really can give a role life. Even in such a bad movie like this, we care for him. And Kim Dickens as his girlfriend is also likable. We care for both of them and the way the movie ends, makes it even more unsatisfying.The plot is just stupid, with story lines that can't be believed. The gangsters take hostages and take them with them for such a long time that you never know why. There's a fault in Gallo's plan to make a lot of money, which never is explained. There is one character development which is surprising but in the end it didn't make any difference if it wasn't.The film wouldn't really be that bad, but Sutherland and Sheen are so bad and annoying, that you just want the movie to end. And Sutherland as a director celebrates violence so much, it's clear that it isn't his effort we care about Gallo and Dickens. Sometimes it seems as if Sutherland took his role behind the camera, shouting 'Yeah, let's kill him and this one and with a lot of blood there and there. Cool!'We don't need movies like that. A movie about nothing, with no message, no more than two interesting characters and a lot of unnecessary violence. That's really the last we need.

The movie then spirals into a pit of idiotic plotting, cheesy drama and unintentionally comic violence that would have fit perfectly into any random episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.In the nigh endless litany of things wrong with Truth or Consequences, N.M., I have to start with the acting. Vincent Gallo is worthless. He has no screen presence and doesn't give an ounce of conviction to any line of dialog he recites. It's like he flunked out of the Quentin Tarantino School of Acting. He's also the least physically attractive guy in the whole cast, whether measured hetero- or homosexually. I've already mentioned Mykelti Williamson's bizarre accent. Most of Kiefer Sutherland's acting in this film is done by his hairdo, though he does let out a Jack Bauer growl on occasion. Martin Sheen plays a mob hit-man and has given better performances doing voiceovers for car commercials. There's not one single second when Kevin Pollak seems like a real person in this story. He could have been replaced by a muppet and not one of the good muppets, like Fozzie Bear. I mean Beaker or Scooter.As for the writing&#x85;well, I'm sure almost all of the words in the script were in the correct order and were accurately punctuated. It's a fiasco on every other level. None of the things that happen in this movie follow any logic except the dictates of the Almighty Plot Hammer. Characters are introduced out of nowhere. Important plot elements are mentioned 30 seconds before coming into play in the story. Foreshadowing is introduced and then abandoned. One cliché after another is piled up like a Pike's Peak of vapid screen writing. I don't think there's one well written instant in the entire movie.Sutherland's direction is vaguely adequate. Nothing looks really bad but nothing looks really good. You certainly wouldn't ever hire him to direct another film because of his work here, though you wouldn't automatically disregard him because of it either.Truth or Consequences, N.M. is just plain dreadful. Avoid it.

The same get-away after a failed robbery, the same police-and-mafia-follow-guys, the same undercover cop, the same ending scene with everyone shooting everyone. The good thing about it is that it has its moments. The dialogue is not bad at all, and the actors, especially Sutherland and Gallo, are very good. But add that to a strange deja-vu feeling you get throughout the whole movie and you got the picture. Doesn't deserve more than 5 out of 10.

Standout performances from Mykelti Williamson and kidnapee Kevin Pollak can't save the utter predictability of the plot, which too often falls under its own pretentiousness.  What a disappointment.

In spite of a good cast, this B-movie is just more of the same old stuff we've all seen many times before with nothing to distinguish itself. Full of plot holes, continuity goofs, abjectly ordinary action, etc. this is one for the late night couch potato only.

At least these films are standing on their own two legs. Usually salvageable from petty films like these are characters, or at least a plot point that made you smile.However.....This film is the ultimate in counterproductive cinema. The film, badly directed by Keifer Sutherland, stars Vincent Gallo and KS himself as thugs, fresh from the big house, attempting a robbery and botching it. Not only is that unoriginal idea in 1997, it's a boring and tiresome gimmick. You may ask yourself, Why did Ben, the almighty movie buff bother watching the film at all?. I am the guilty Vincent Gallo fan. Watching him in T or C, NM was as painful as watching the great Gary Oldman in Leon. This film is so badly written, even the actors are struggling to cope - desperatley holding onto the idea that a paycheck is not far out of reach. (Unfortunately, they must live with the legacy that they've created a film this poor).Here's the other gripe Some films pretend to be Tarantino ripoffs - this film is the real thing - the coup de gras of cinematic theivery. From the off-the-wall comedic psycho mentality that Kiefer Sutherland displays killing every man in sight (Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs, a shot-for-shot steal from Ringo Lam's City on Fire) to the lovers on the lam with a suitcase of cocaine building to a mob/police battle in the finale (directly cased from True Romance, itself a ripoff of Badlands) to the attempt at snappy dialogue / pop refererences with the Twilight Zone edge-standing quarter speech (stolen from any of QT's films - we'll say Pulp Fiction being that it's not yet represented in my gripe) to, finally, the hostage-taking amidst tons of talk of fate / marriage / excessive PDA that made Natural Born Killers nonchalant killing all the more disturbing and excessive (of course, it does nothing here but feel forced and unattractive).Finally, the most shameless of all - a washed up Martin Sheen doing his best Christopher Walken impression while trying to extract information from Max Perlich. Are these filmmaker's kidding me?When a film displays this much disaster in it's script and it's stealing - and still finds time for jump cuts, bad lighting and truly flat characterization, character development and casting - where do I stand as a young filmmaker/ writer who can't get anything made. At least, at the very least - my amateurish nature could give way to something original that someone else will steal and fly with.Hollywood has become a stalking ground of copycats and pseudo-artists with no real talent except for their looks. When films like this erupt, how long do we have before Celluloid is dead forever?Am I overreacting? I don't think so.

However, the violent content in Truth or Consequences, N.M. disturbed me. This is a movie that has no humanity at all. Characters are violently killed on a whim throughout, and the movie has no humanity at all. I think what really disturbed me was that this violent content was placed against a movie that otherwise wants to be a light-hearted romp, an attempt to emulate the style of Pulp Fiction. But this movie is not made with Tarantino skill. It's just a simple-minded exercise with no wit, no insight, and just an excuse to follow repulsive characters for a 100 or so minutes. It's no wonder the distributor didn't give this much of a release.

And keeping a pair of hostages, but basically letting them roam free around the Winebago at night? Come on!The only redeeming factor is SOME of the acting. Kiefer Sutherland is convincing as a hotheaded, sadistic stick-up man, a lot more convincing than his mad doctor role in Dark City. The guy that plays Ray, the leader of the gang, is pretty good, too.But Martin Sheen's Sir character is completely laughable. He's supposed to be some kind of Angel of Death, who strikes fear into anyone who dares look in his eyes, but comes across as someone who has been lobotomized. I blame the dialogue for creating this impression, especially the scene where he is introduced to the mafia circle of leaders and the final shootout scene as well.

After half a dozen scenes with the car, it's finally dumped.This is definitely a small point--one of many that this film randomly produces.  It's an ironic downfall that Truth or Consequences, N.M. doesn't show the same commitment to detail as the style it rips off. "}]
