[{"Title":"Darker than your average action film","Date":"19 November 2005","Score":"68 out of 76 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Hyped to the heavens when it first came out as Schwarzenegger's comeback movie, this 1999 film steers the Governor away from his attempts at comedy and collaborations with Danny Devito and back into the sort of action packed carnage that made his name in the first place. However, where the likes of Commando had him portraying invincible supermen with a neat array of guns and one liners to hand, End of Days is considerably darker.Set in New York on the eve of Millennium, the film shows a version of the Austrian Oak previously never witnessed. He plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic ex-Cop in charge of a security squad who finds himself embroiled in a battle to save a young girl (Robin Tunney) from being raped by the devil (a sadly, rather ineffective Gabriel Byrne) and bringing about Armageddon. As you do.Cane himself is not the best sort of man for saving all creation either. He is mired in deep depression, has abandoned any faith in God he may have once had and when we first see him, is contemplating suicide. However, saving the girl gives him a drive and determination even when faced with some conflicting views from the Catholic Church about how best to go about this. All of this takes place in a very grim and gritty vision of New York where the rain never stops falling, urban decay is rife and pillars of steam rise from manhole covers. It is a fitting location for the end of all creation to begin and cast a dark veil over the flick.Of course, that isn't to say the film is all doom and gloom as there are a few glimpses of just how seriously the makers weren't taking their project (the argument between Arnold and Kevin Pollack in the former's apartment is hilarious). Plus, while the story and characters are all developed to match the atmosphere of impending dread during the first hour and a half, the last twenty minutes are made up of the kind of explosive action that strangely doesn't jar against the grimmer nature of the rest of the film, though the CGI devil at the climax is pushing it a little.All in all, an enjoyable romp for fans of the Governator before his attention was diverted by a political career. It compares well to his classic eighties work by trying to do something different and while it may not gel properly in places, for a good 80% of the running time it does a very entertaining job.

He's battled Terminators, Greek gods, bears, alligators, planes, and macho men in fish net clothing. The only choice left is, of course, Satan. So they put together a movie about Satan and gave Arnie the lead.I think everyone working on this thought it would be much better than it actually is. The script was in development for years and Arnie fought to get it made. It's kind of unfortunate because Arnold gives a fairly decent performance in a film muddled with clich√©s. Of course, it's hard enough to buy a guy with a body like Arnold being a slob who drinks beer and pizza smoothees for breakfast. Getting someone like Jim Belushi might have seemed more realistic.Apart from the physicality, Arnold's performance is fine. He cries. He does the emotion scenes well enough - at least well enough to find bearable.It's the direction that ruins this movie. Peter Hyams is a terrible director and has ruined some very unique films in the past (his most notorious butchering in my opinion was of a 1983 Michael Douglas film called The Star Chamber - great premise, awful directing).End of Days is like Exorcist meets every supernatural thriller ever made. On top of that, Gabriel Byrne should be more menacing. Robin Tunney should be less butch-looking. The direction shouldn't feel like some low-grade TV commercial - all style, no substance.Is the movie terrible? No. It's not as bad as everyone made it out to be. But it's pretty much the definition of mediocre. Do I own it on DVD? Hell yeah. It's an Arnold movie - it's an automatic must-buy. But if you're not a fan of Arnie, I wouldn't recommend it - at all. It pretty much feels like any average made-for-TV scary-flick - with even worse direction.The only other good aspect of this film was that it brought Axl Rose out of seclusion to record his first original song in seven years with a new incarnation of Guns N' Roses. The song, Oh My God, didn't do too well with the critics. A bit of a shame, really. I dug it. It also fits the industrial, edgy tone of the film.

Since the film was first released in 1999, the movie could not resist to throw in that little contrivance. What can you expect from a movie when its premise is based on the concept that once every thousand years if Satan impregnates a woman during the hour from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. on the last day of the millennium, she will give birth to the anti-Christ who will bring the world to an end? I am already thinking that the movie is vulnerable to logic (is the time given in Eastern Standard?) and it will make its own limitations at the convenience of plot. End of Days is particularly graphic in its use of violence, but never really scares us, even with such a horrifying premise like the end of humanity. 	Arnold Schwarzenegger has not made a good movie in a long time. First Jingle all the Way, then Batman & Robin, now we have a movie that bounces back and forth between action and concept. There are the standard action movie scenes, where a person sways from a helicopter in mid air, where a chase scene takes place at incredible heights, where someone grasps to a high window ledge, where a subway train crashes, where a massive fire erupts in Manhattan, and so on. There are also the false shocko moments followed with a sudden burst of loud, startling music the its just a cat scene, its just another cop scene, its just a dream scene, its just your imagination scene, he's not really dead scene, and its just maggots suddenly growing out of an apple scene. The movie is also bound by philosophy. The action is focused towards Schwarzenegger saving the world, but he cannot do that all by himself, can he? Sure he can, if he can stop Satan (Gabriel Bryne), from impregnating Christine (Robin Tunney), who was born under the religious sign of a passing comet -- and based on her birth twenty years earlier during the sighting of that comet &#150; is the chosen mother of Satan's child. 	End of Days begins with an intriguing, although plausible, premise. The bizarre events that transpire a few days before the end of the millennium immediately inspire our curiosity. The action sequences are also fine, intensified by thrilling music and a fast paced style. The movie opens on a good note, and the remainder of the action sequences are also quite exciting. The scenes also inspire a few questions. Satan kills many people in this movie, people just like the hero, so why doesn't he just finish Arnold Schwarzenegger off like he does with so many other characters. On the other side, Schwarzenegger shoots the devil, who pulls his shirt up so we can see the bullet holes immediately healing. When using a machine-gun, the ammunition flings the Prince of Darkness backward and puts him down before he attacks again. There are simply no rules to abide by here. 	End of Days does not have a whole lot of explanation; it plays sort of like your run of the mill action picture with the gimmick of the week. There just is not a lot of true involvement or engagement after the premise. We do care about Arnold Swarzzenegger's character, and Gabrial Bryne is an especially convincing Satan. He is devilish, with fiendish appeal, proving that tranquillity is the most terrifying evil. Al Pachino did an equally diabolical job in The Devils Advocate, but Bryne is even more terrifying. Robin Tunney has nothing to do but exchange shameless subtext with Schwarzenegger's character. (You're better than everyone else, just remember that. I don't want to be better or worse, I just want to be normal.) She is more of a plot device than an actual character.	Excellent convincing set designs appear frequently, especially near the end where the characters wander through dark chambers and dim hallways. Cinematography also adds a nice touch to the suspenseful, mysterious atmosphere, all done by the movie's director, Peter Hyams (The Relic). It is too bad such good filmmaking does not have a story fit enough to back it up. One more thing I just have to mention Why do the cops always show up at the end of the movie, after the action is over. I am getting very tired of that.

Also a little of Kevin Pollack goes a very long way. Hyams is a gifted director OUTLAND answers any questions of whether he is up for suspense or not. First let's talk about the real reason it is hated. All the other devil flicks God loses or is on vacation apparently.THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE THE OMEN THE EXORCIST NEEDFUL THINGS God loses in all these films prayers fail; the devil is all powerful. Without delving into theology suffice to say boys and girls if you are going into metaphysics stealing deities it would be nice if you knew who was who and their respective histories. HELLO READ THE BIBLE Satan LOSES. These fat new age decadents are so hilarious they want to steal the devil because they have the same moral system NONE. Yet they go together dear you cannot have Satan without God. Usually God is on vacation the Devil runs rampant prayers are useless. What someone made a film where God defeats the Devil? A man prays God shows him Michael's sword the weapon he sent Satan into hell with and the man is saved sees his child and wife before he dies? OUT WITH IT! In another time another zeitgeist this film would have been canonized. If Cecil B DeMille lived today THE TEN COMMANDMENTS would never have been made. He would be unemployed or making the vile trash like SIN CITY if he wished to eat and pay his bills. I love the earlier reviews cloaking the underlying real reason; it is suspenseful, has many pop out scares the effects are still impressive. The devil is presented as the lying double dealing murderous misanthropic monster he is. I love when he holds arnie over the street,you see those insignificant dots down there that is what you are to me.'' No he is not bringing the light or thinking happy thoughts. The ending models nobility and true love giving of yourself even to death. Yes Sin City is a much better film for the kiddies. The moral system is why they hate Christianity so much by the way. I am a theistic existentialist yet it annoys even me. They must have their films ethics free like where superman wipes out Metropolis but saves Lois and a token family in Man Of Steel. The same in Star Crap Descent Into Moral Darkness. The man kills 60 people but saves his precious baby; seeing a pattern here? Yes, atavistic narcissism that cares only for itself others lives mean nothing. Yes the acting is sub par; have you seen Man of Steel? It is better than Henry Cavill. I recommend this film strongly yes it has the usual few Catholic scenes of their visionaries, I know, just go get some popcorn come back. Rod Steiger gives an excellent performance; Byrne portrays the Devil well and theologically correctly. Cold and full of hate for God and hello Man also. He is not your friend. Any film where God wins, faith is rewarded, nobility is modeled and love shown for what it truly is New Age denuded; SACRIFICE. Parents the film is quite violent with a graphic sex scene not for kids. The cable censored version would be a better choice. Also the language. I love the non PC scene where Satan says to the pedophile cop,the scent of all those boys is on you remember who you serve. Enough said, you get my point guess the real reason the film is calumniated to death.

Marlowe and ham-handedly directed by Peter Hyams, *End of Days* gets The Terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation), whilst blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming Biblical verse to give Catholics something more to whine about.It is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn. Even as the technological stank of Y2K muttons the New York streets, ex-cop turned alcoholic security guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the perfunctory dead-wife-and-kid back-story for Loose Cannon effect), must brave theological waters to save 20-year-old virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) from being conscripted as &#150; wait for it &#150; The Bride of Satan. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity ensues.For every anti-hero, there is his anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here &#150; and he's out to party like it's 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with the Anti-Christ between 11 pm and 12 midnight, December 31, 1999 &#150; ironically, in the hour that all porn will be lost &#150; thereby bringing about the End of Days. Being able to read minds, conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic, it doesn't occur to Satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting Christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time; instead, he appears on December 28th like a Keyser Soze Terminator and wonders why she doesn't welcome him with open thighs&#133; (See above comment re stupidity.) Here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered, let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with a '1' in front of it. So wait - *Prince* is the Anti-Christ?Satan Soze pursues Jericho and Christine (J and C &#150; get it?) around town, at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture. In one scene, Satan recreates Jericho's wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply into Jericho's mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia, why can't he see where Jericho hid Christine not ten minutes ago? Satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue, yet he can't make that assassin unjam a semi-automatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan at point blank range, Satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing, so Jericho won't worry unduly about Satan's health - not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds&#133; Matter of fact, instead of simply possessing Jericho himself to get close to Christine and rape her, Satan expends so much unnecessary energy on side-projects (crucifying the tongue-less guy, blowing up Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) and then saving him, and then blowing him up again, ridiculously battling Jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought) that we wonder whether a more efficient assassin/lover shouldn't be put on the case &#150; say, Antonio Banderas.What I find most precious about *End of Days* is Arnold's valiant attempts at The Method sad means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; depressed means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent; deathly scared means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent. There's definitely a pattern here, if we could only decipher it.In the end, the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom Catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these, but from the atheist Jericho. While the timid men of an impotent god exhort faith and quiver in their cells doing nothing about Satan actually walking amongst them, the Prince of Darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent. Which clearly says something that Catholics blindly refuse to hear that even if the Devil were to exist, those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall, let alone act towards it. Further, they might not truly WANT him defeated, for only through his contrary polarity does their god's existence become tenable.For it is written in the Book of Revelations And the Prince of Darkness shall descendeth upon the Earth without any solid game plan, and impregnate a virgin on a date which won't have any significance until the Gregorian Calendar of the 1500s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the Anno Domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia, by which time, Christians will have forgotten Christ's actual birth date and appropriated the pagan Saturnalia festival in its stead. And the Prince shall effect a Revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguously-lesbian band members&#133; I can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified, and the alcoholic built like a Mr. Universe; I can believe that a giant, supernatural monster can't kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century Celtic Druid ritual as foreplay - but what I cannot believe is the 20-year-old virgin in New York City in 1999.Especially around Prince...

It's extremely 'cool' to be anti-religion these days, so big-budget movies with a core religious theme tend to get unnecessarily slammed. I'm not religious myself, but I do often enjoy supernatural and religiously themed stories, due to the themes and issues they frequently explore. So its success all hinges on whether you can accept a plot guided by supernatural religious elements or not. If you can, and you enjoy action movies occasionally, you'll probably enjoy End of Days.Arnold plays a depressed ex-cop turned high-level body guard with a suitably tragic back-story. Some people will enjoy his performance, others won't. Again, it depends on how you come to this. If you are expecting a versatile actor who changes personality with every performance, then you won't enjoy it. If you like Arnold, because he is exactly what he is, Arnold, then you'll probably have a ball. After all, who ever hired Charlton Heston or Humphrey Bogart or Christopher Walken to play a part in any way other than the specific way they do? You don't hire such actors because of their chameleon-like acting abilities, you hire them because their sheer screen presence is such that they stand out from the crowd and you enjoy seeing THEM in the role. As such, you either relish those actors in their parts, or you you dismiss them as wooden or bland. It depends on the viewer.The director, Peter Hyams (2010, Outland, Timecop, The Relic), has a tendency to enjoy very dark cinematography, and in this case it suits things perfectly. There are lots of scenes lit primarily by flames or torchlight, that set the tone. Meanwhile, John Debney's (Cutthroat Island, Passion of the Christ) score is also one of his best, and probably one the most effective 'demonic' soundtracks since Goldsmith's Omen trilogy. I would be remiss not to mention the effects work as well. Having watched the DVD special features, I was extremely impressed with how much old-style artistry and craftsmanship went into many of the effects. There was a great deal of miniature work involved, which is too often sidelined for less effective CGI these days. End of Days used a careful blend, only really using CGI where necessary.End of Days is a great roller-coaster ride of a movie, entirely suited to the date it was made for, and has a surprising amount of depth. Under the action and excitement, it's really a story about the main character's redemption, finding himself again, and discovering a meaning to his life after all he thought he had lost. It's also a classic good versus evil tale. To top it all off, we get a surprisingly touching and moving finale, which perhaps left a lot of people on too much of a downer, yet I found it the perfect conclusion to the story.All in all, End of Days is either a love-it or hate-it movie. It's not perfect, but I thought it was an excellent film, and one of Arnold's most interesting characters. If you don't mind religious themes, enjoy larger-than-life characters and adrenaline pounding action, then chances are you'll probably have a fantastic ride.

So far so good , so why include the character of Jerico Cane , a burned out suicidal cop ?

Worse still Jerico Cane is played by big Arnie which means through box office necessity ( ie box office bucks ) instead of END OF DAYS being a haunting supernatural drama it ends up being a supernatural action/adventure movie that doesn`t work . It should also be pointed out that Arnie doesn`t have the acting range to play a burned out sucidal cop . How about this as a casting premise Anthony Hopkins plays a disillusioned priest trying to save Christine York from Satan . Doesn`t that sound a whole lot better ? Not to be too negative the story is interesting in places , and I`m sure the first draft of the script was very moody and atmospheric until the screenplay was re-written to death . Gabriel Byrne plays Satan with the exact right mixture of charm and menace which leads me to believe he`d be the perfect choice as The Master if Hollywood ever make a big budget screen version of DOCTOR WHO .

He is now private security guard and traps a mysterious sniper who tried to kill one of his clients. Soon he learns that there are some very bad things going on in the city, and the new millennium is very close..It is the last days of December, 1999.I really liked the scare department in this demonic little horror thriller from this talented director and director of photography, Peter Hyams. This film is full of effective and very ominous images and scenery and the film is very dark. I appreciate perhaps most the shots above the city and the twisted use of camera up there. That really creates a feeling of evil and that something very powerful and wicked is above the city and is about to get power. Hyams once again shows his talent as he has been the director of photography many times earlier in his own films. End of Days reminded me occasionally of Alex de la Iglesia's great horror film El Dia de la Bestia (Day of the Beast), a brilliant mix of black comedy and VERY dark imagery and atmosphere. As incredible as it sounds, this mainstream produced film is that effective, thanks to the talented men behind the camera.There are some flaws, too, and the most irritating things is perhaps the cliche ending, which I definitely won't spoil here, but is without a doubt there only to satisfy the audience and create the safe and familiar Happy Ending. If this was made 20 years ago, the ending would definitely have been different; it would've been how the director wanted to, not hot the audience wanted to. That tones the otherwise great and exciting finale a little bit down, but fortunately it is not as syrupy as possible. Another negative thing that I can tell is the editing which is very fast, unstylishly and ineffectively fast and restless. Fast edits can be great elements if used right and with skill, but in this film, they are in my opinion gratuitously fast and too plenty. Just watch the action scenes and count how many edits there are in one minute. The editors should have realized that sometimes - and in this case - less is more. These flaws are still tolerable especially when I keep in mind how many positive points there are in this film.End of Days is also very exciting and fast paced. The train segment is great and especially the clock ticking finale when the millennium is about to change, is very skillfully created and hold my full attention. The finale is pretty similar to the finale in Kathryn Bigelow's own millennium related film, a paranoid and effective thriller Strange Days (1995). In End of Days, there are also couple of genuinely frightening, scary, sudden and loud shocks that require a movie theatre to fully work. The nightmare sequences are also chillingly original and brought to my mind the great horror classics that even Hollywood sometimes produced. The demon which Christine sees in her dreams is very scary and almost as frightening as the similar character in David Lynch's masterwork Lost Highway.As a horror film, End of Days works fine and creates an atmosphere that is so rare in mainstream films nowadays. I didn't have any expectations when I placed the VHS in my VCR, and so I was pleasantly surprised of what I saw and experienced. If we stay in the 90's, I could say that End of Days is kind of tamer version of Day of the Beast and without its comic elements. There are comic elements in End of Days, too, but those are not, fortunately, the usual Hollywood one-liners and stupid bits of dialogue. Gabriel Byrne over-acts occasionally little, but many guys who play devils seem to have this problem! He is almost as cool and modern devil as Al Pacino in Taylor Hackford's Devil's Advocate, a film which also has great atmosphere but is more restrained and drama oriented.End of Days gets 7/10 from me.

What basically happens here is a cocktail of 'Lost Souls', 'Devils Advocate' and 'Rosemarys Baby'. The final battle (spoiler!) involves some archetypal elements such as the ever-famous change of character (and the expectable sentence 'fight against it') and the sacrifice of the Good in order to triumph over the Evil. For Arnold fans, there is even a little bit of a helicopter pursuit and a sub-train chase.Even considered it's nature as a fantasy-horror-mix-up, this films storyline has some plot holes. On the other hand, some scenes are surprisingly funny, but were presumably not intended to be (for instance Jerichos fight with Christine stepmother). On the other hand, for a blockbuster (and especially a film starring A.S.) this one also has some uneasy moments. Byrne isn't so bad as the Devil, a role that demands comparison which him playing a priest in the not much later filmed 'Stigmata'. As for Arnie, he's again playing the same character of most of his films, this time with a slice of negative attitude. Who would have thought that he'd ever receive a crucifixion on screen? John Debney wrote a musical score that is not bad, but he has done much better elsewhere. And so has the director. In all, this film, probably the most ambitious one Peter Hyams has ever made, fails exactly because of that It wants to be bigger than it's story can be. It makes an entertaining video session for once or twice, but it's not something you'd take with you on an abandoned island.

You may have heard rumors that the big man tries acting this time out, but not to worry; his moments of soul searching and introspection are kept to a minimum. He does get crucified, however, which requires a bit of a stretch. Lots of firepower, violence, special effects and action deliver just what fans of the star want from a movie. As such, it is a relatively painless watch and delivers some goods. A few days before the millennium, earthquakes and subterranean fires hit New York. Relax...it's just the Devil arriving. He has come to town to meet his bride and to conceive a child, the antichrist. Biblical prophesies have warned that if the Devil has his way with a certain virgin between 11pm and midnight on New Year's Eve it will bring about the so-called End of Days. Satan will be able to take control of the Universe away from God for the next thousand years. Jericho Cane, an alcoholic ex-cop now working in security, seems to be the only person in the tri-state area capable of saving mankind. Where is Mayor Giuliani when you need him? With Arnold on the case, who needs elected officials? Robin Tunney plays the spunky virgin in question who has been destined for this unholy union since birth. Kevin Pollack, as Jericho's mouthy sidekick, gets most of the funny lines. Gabriel Byrne adds a touch of class playing The Man who has devilishly taken over the body of a Wall Street banker. Great disguise, Lucifer! My favorite scene was the knock-down, drag-out fight Arnie has with rotund little Miriam Margolyes who plays one of the Devil's minions. Oh yea, and that awesome dinner scene when Lucifer grabs that womans..um&#133;well, you'll see.  Director Peter Hyams gets the big action set-pieces right and does his darndest to pass Los Angeles off as New York. That is actually the Times Square celebration of 1998/99 that we see at the moment of climax. No matter how hard they tried, downtown Los Angeles is not NYC.

Yes, this movie (which, I must admit, performed superbly in the action stakes; despite what his detractors may say, Arnie still has it) rams the good ol' hellfire and brimstone religion down your throat like you wouldn't believe.  Basing itself on the Book of Revelation (what else?), this film has that funny old fellow Satan attempting to bring about the end of the world by finding some unsuspecting woman, bonking her, and impregnating her with his vile seed (or something).  Naturally, Arnie must stop this, and the film revolves around his (extremely violent) attempts to do so.  None of the characters are terribly appealing and the whole movie is incredibly depressing; you get the impression that most of humanity is going to end up burning forever in Hell (which, incidentally, Satan merely has the misfortune to live in; he didn't make the rotten place, God did).  Psychotic priests attempt to kill Satan's bride-to-be (a rather apt metaphor, I felt, for the way that the good guys in the film were just as scary as the bad ones) while a bunch of other priests wring their hands annoyingly and vomit forth great torrents of verbal diarrhoea about the importance of faith.  Arnie is portrayed as being bad because he has no faith (preferring to rely instead on his impressive arsenal of guns), yet in the movie, HIS GUNS SAVE THE DAY!!!!  HA HA HA. God, on the other hand, does bugger all!  He just lets the human characters sort everything out by themselves (even Arnie's final triumph over Satan is entirely the result of his own efforts), and presumably takes full credit for it at the end.

The ending of the film, *POSSIBLE SPOILER* where Jericho drops his weapon in favor of faith is hugely powerful, accompanied by the haunting choir music that is the film's background. *END SPOILER*Kevin Pollack's character, Chicago, acts as light comic relief, but also gives some of the great lines in the film (It's official.

He also provides a great performance in the more dark, serious parts of the film.Robin Tunney is perfect as Christine York, with the character having a very vulnerable edge, and the relationship between her and Jericho forming an almost father-daughter relationship.Finally, Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of the man is amazing.

The mood was decidedly creepy and on occasion gets rather disturbing. Hyams conjures up some pretty evil and demented scenes, although not as disturbing if you've seen the recent pictures with similar undertones. The action is orchestrated with style and vigor, especially the whole subway-bit and the scene with Arnold dangling from a police helicopter. Byrne's performance as Ole Nick himself is very understated, but one gaze conveys as much evil as Pacino did with a whole monologue. Who said less is more? Kudos to Stan The Man Winston for the icky demon at the end, although it could have done with some more screen time.End of Days does however suffer because of the premise of merging action with heavy religious themes. The broody atmosphere suffers when the action kicks in and Arnold starts blasting away with his machine gun. This was kind of distracting and at some times seemed rather ludicrous as well. Also, poor Arnold has to do away with evil all by himself, action-hero style, which somehow conveys the wrong message to me. End of Days is also pretty derivative and the whole Satan takes a bride-premise has been done much better before, even when it was delivered as a comedy aka The Witches of Eastwick (Jack is still to date the best Devil...). But since End of Days is such a dramatic departure for Arnold, the movie shouldn't be compared to classics like The Omen and The Ninth gate at all. Instead, enjoy it for what it is well-produced escapism. Lots of action, gore and some shivers-up-your-spine imagery. Thanks, Arnold, you did it again!!!

He also explains to them that she must live and not be harmed. Then, the movie cuts to 6 hours later in New York City where a woman is having her child in the hospital. Now what freaked me out about that scene was that the nurse who delivered the baby works for Satan. When she claimed that she was going to clean the baby up, she actually takes it downstairs to the basement and has a Satanic priest do a ritual by cutting a rattle snake open and using its blood to expose the child to evil. I found that to be in poor taste.20 years later in New York, just a few days before New Years Eve, there is a brief sequence where Satan rises from the sewers of the city and posesses a man (Gabrielle Byrne) and his body. Next, the unexpected happened. We see Arnold for the first time in a long time. He plays a stressed out security guard who's wife and daughter were killed on Christmas Eve. He and his partner (Kevin Pollack) arrest a former priest who has a cut out tounge. He claims that the end of days will occur on New Years. He also tells them about a GIRL named Christine York (Robin Tunney) who is Satans chosen one, the priest says that if Arnold and Kevin don't protect her, she will cause the destruction of earth.I think I've said enough about this movie and I think that they should have made Arnold's character more heroic and stronger than what they did.

Satan flies around in Predator-mode until he can take over a body (Byrne's), and then spends the movie tracking down Christine.

Ho-hum.Acting. It's Arnie. Here he's not quite trying to be the cardboard-cut out action hero. Instead Cane is the washed-out alcoholic-dead-family cop, lifted from the book of Character Clich√©s. He's not all that sympathetic, and I ended up not caring all that matter if the world was over-taken by Satan. Arnie uses all his power to invest something into a character with more dimension than his typical role and he succeeds. well actually he doesn't really. He's Arnie, and couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Who cares though, we didn't expect the loveable lug to succeed. Better is Gabriel Byrne, playing the calm and collected devil whispering sweet temptations into Arnie's ears. It's a melodramatic, and reminiscent of Pacino in `The Devil's Advocate' but Byrne seems to be having a bit of fun with the Satanic persona, and it's a laugh to watch. Tunney deserves mention only for the fact she appeared in a movie and did very little with her flat, weak, portrayal of the devil's bride. She's very forgettable.Plot wise the story is a bit of a joke. It rambles and mutters about the forthcoming end in a cryptic manner. It tries to pass of an act of obfuscation as hiding something more intelligent than is actually there. The truth is that there's a weak mess of contrived coincidences, pointless plot devices, and clammy characterisation being desperately sold off as eerie and creepy. Sorry, showing some religious iconography and blathering about mystical conjunctions doesn't create substance and only thinly disguises the lack of meat beneath. Later on in the movie things happen with even less-of-a-reason, with greater and more momentous events flung about in an attempt to give a sense of scale. It doesn't quite work because the whole thing does not gel well together, and you're left feeling that people are milling about the place, waiting for the final showdown (which is reasonably entertaining).The directing isn't up to much. The lighting is too murky at times and, in one scene, dreadfully confusing. This is further hampered by some overly-zealous editor, who tries to spice up some fights by cutting every few seconds. Thus the film seems disjointed at times, confusing not in plot, but visually. Sure we need darkness and religious paraphernalia dotted all over the place. but do we need such an abundance of them? Is there a need for a million candles? It's not like they're used as effectively as a lighting source as they were in `Barry Lyndon' now.`End of Days' is not a disaster. It's just not very good. Arnie's acting is laughable, and the movie is not nearly as cohesive as it should be. The action scenes, due to some poor directing, are never exciting and I didn't really care too much about the characters. There are some fun moments, but in a cheap-forgettable sense.

Gabriel Byrne was even worse, playing Satan with a palooka NY accent.  Someone should teach his agent the word No. And poor Rod Steiger!  His decline continues with another bald caricature role.  Has it really been 35 years since The Pawnbroker was released?Arnold is, well, Arnold.  Without competent direction and a decent story, he's just a pumped-up Austrian peasant lost in the big city.  You get what you pay for with Arnold, but you'd better make sure the vehicle can carry his weight, or he'll collapse with everything around him as he did here.I don't usually draw far-reaching conclusions from films, either good ones or lousy ones, but End of Days is clear evidence that something's rotten in Hollywood.

I was excited about this film, despite a lackluster trailer, because it used fancy technology called a website to engender a feeling of fear and interest within me.  Now I understand, this movie really DOES signal the end...of quality filmmaking. Where should I begin?Was it Peter Hyams, performing far, far below par, even for him?  Peter Hyams has always been a talented hack ('Capricorn One','Outland','2010','Timecop','Sudden Death'), but this time out it appears he was in the grip of a malaise not felt by a studio director since Irwin Allen barfed out 'The Swarm'.  I mean, this film LOOKS like it was made in the seventies, with big fake pieces of fake cement wall falling down, a big fake looking miniature subway train blowing up in a totally fake Japanese monster movie way, and big fake burning window panes straight out of an episode of 'The Big Valley'. Imagine the big fake falling rocks from 'Earthquake', cross it with the sets (the very SAME sets) from 'Soylent Green', and then imagine that every 10 minutes or so the budget included an crappy-looking cgi effect.  I refuse to believe that it cost 100 million.  Fake fake fake!  What good is an idiotic action movie when it doesn't even deliver the carnage?Or was it the script?  Obviously written with 10 year old white boys in mind, and adults with similar mentalities.  All I'm gonna say is that I wouldn't be surprised if the Christian Coalition had co-funded this movie. The amount of strange, intolerant messages sent by this film as actually quite frightening.The soundtrack should be discussed, since it refused to be ignored!  It's as if the filmmakers said 'Ahem, this is really boring and fake, how can we make it seem important?  I know, a loud soundtrack with unwarranted menacing horn bursts!'Or how about Arnold himself?  I can't believe him, taking part in this film. I used to love him!  It was okay that he was kind of a bully, because he seemed so tongue-in-cheek.  All it tells me is that he has no idea of what quality is, and that he just lucked out previously.Ah, What's the point?  It sucks, hugely.  WWF fans will flock to it anyway.In short overbearing, intrusive soundtrack+very fake stuntwork+terrible script+poor effects+ awful finale+extra wooden hero= sadness inducing waste of time.

The movie is self explanatory in the title. Schwarzenegger saves the world from eternal damnation, who would have thought? The things I found distasteful about this flick are the fact that Satan had way too much power than should have been portrayed. It seemed to me that only Jericho (Schwarzenegger's character) could defeat Satan and God had the power only through Jericho. It seems to me that if Satan is who he is and Jericho is only a man the odds of Jericho winning were much less than the movie portrayed. The special effects on the other hand were quite good and the detail of the story as well as religious background and information were interesting to contemplate although most were false. The character that Arnold played was good for him and it showed a little more of the inside of his character rather than his usual `muscle-bound-brute'. Arnold's character had his own personal problems in this movie that made him seem more real. This was the first time I had seen Gabriel Byrne in a movie since `The Man in the Iron Mask.'

Muddling direction, meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, rapid-fire MTV-style editing and poor acting all the way.That's not to say End of Days isn't watchable. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker, which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the U.S.I won't go into the details explaining why End of Days violates the law of movie logic, but here are several problems with this movie(SPOILER)After the Devil walks out, the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. No snapping finger, no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. How could this happen?Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow magically comes up with the name Christine York after examining the phrase Christ in New York carved on a victim's body, runs the database on the computer and, viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. How did the characters who have come in contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the movie? I laughed out loud when I recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine.All the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle?The Devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood, yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. Logically, this is impossible.As the Devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character runs into the solid Christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically.The Devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree, yet he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends to.How the Devil's object of desire's parents died and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all.In the sequence that's a rip-off of Speed, Arnold and the Devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. This is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact.Arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, yet the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sake.At the beginning of the movie, after the Devil took over a man's body, all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing?Arnold's recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME! are the perfect fodder for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line You're the luggage!.The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. So are the pseudo-religious babble about the Christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the Devil's object of desire. (END SPOILERS)It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The director's indulgence of excess is a factor here. He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.Hence, End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York.

They failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film.  He attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood.  This method can work if used correctly (see Se7en) but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us. Hyams is a decent action director, and offers nothing more here than basic shoot outs and fight scenes, except for the lackluster, sub par f/x end battle. As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates actual ability, displaying some good frame work and movement, but it is nothing above solid work.Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe is the film's greatest enemy.  At parts, the script actually shows the makings of good religious thriller, and at times it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the Temptation scene between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small pluses are choked out by a river of negatives.  Generic dialogue/characters, gapping plot holes, and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard Hollywood black holes Marlowe's screenplay falls into.  The shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly.The film surprisingly has a good cast.  Arnold, still possessing that larger than life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on the edge cop with no more than average results.  Stick to be the invincible hero Arnie, it's what your good at.  Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of Satan.  In a villainous role ripe for overacting, Byrne restrains himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character.  Kevin Pollak, as normal, is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he's done better.  Also look for a stellar small role from Rod Steiger.Hyams looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of Hollywood action films.

The result was end of days.I was told that it was a laughable movie, I probably agree with that. It's especially true at the level of the dialogs which contain several times the childish terms, nice guys and bad guys to qualify the characters. Otherwise, I think that the movie's got nothing great, neither is it a really bad movie. End of Days is just a dull and lacklustre movie. The screenplay works like a common detective story without any major surprises and it contains a quite important number of unlikelinesses. For example, the devil isn't supposed to enter the church (God's house) and however he succeeds in! Moreover, the film-maker Peter Hyams didn't skimp on the bloody effects.Besides, I was astonished by discovering that Peter Hyams made this movie. Twenty one years ago, he made an original and brilliant science-fiction movie called Capricorn one. So, when you think about this, you can say that he must have lost his gift with the passing years.End of days isn't really a suspense film because we guess the devil's grim intentions from the start of the movie. As far as Schwarzenegger is concerned, he looks exhausted and doesn't seem imposing as he was, in the past. Hyams gave him a picture of a cop tormented by the death of his family and a strong taste for alcohol, probably to get him rid of his picture of bold and invincible hero. At least, it's better to see Schwarzy in an action movie rather than in a comedy where he's nearly always pitiful.A remark end of days is the second movie featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in the main role to include a Guns N'Roses song in the original soundtrack. The first one was Terminator 2 and the name of the song was you could be mine. Here, the song's called Oh! My God. Oh! My God, how right you are Axl Rose!

The hope of humanity falls on an atheist ex-cop, Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), and his partner (Kevin Pollak). Rod Steiger is also on hand as a no-nonsense Catholic priest.End of Days is a comic book action flick with horror/fantasy elements. It's not meant to be an accurate depiction of biblical eschatology. As such, it's useless to pick it apart on these grounds; just go with it and enjoy the ride. That said, there are some real-life subtexts and accurate biblical aspects. For instance, disillusionment due to the unjust death of a loved one (or any number of other tragedies) happens all the time.The movie is R-rated not just for the violence and cussing, but because the filmmakers try to convey the devil's filthy lawlessness, like a threesome with a mother & daughter in a brief dream sequence (which may be reality, but it's hard to tell). Byrne has fun with the role of Satan.As a holiday action blockbuster with Schwarzenegger End of Days delivers the requisite thrills where there's a massive explosion about every 12 minutes. These types of movies only work if the story and the characters pull you into their world and the film accomplishes this just enough. It's no where near as good as the first two Terminator flicks, but it's close to being on par with the third one. Of course, End of Days is its own animal due to the dark, religious subject matter. On that note, the palette the filmmakers use is fittingly dark. The entire film takes place at night, mostly in the urban labyrinths of New York City with additional sequences in Gothic churches, shadowy subterranean rooms and eerie woods.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in New York City and the Los Angeles area.GRADE B "},{"Title":"Dark gritty Arnold but still a minor failure","Date":"5 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The church has searched for Christine York (Robin Tunney) since her birth but the forces of evil have controlled her from the start.

I wish he forgets about this being a Schwarzeneggar movie, and concentrate on making this dark.I do have a minor problem. I'd probably keep Jericho as a cop. It would be more logical for him and his partner to keep investigating if they are cops. If they are the security, why would Satan be walking around by himself? And it would solve the problem of Jericho having to work for Satan.The bigger problem is Arnold going up against Satan. The idea of the ticking clock is obviously hokey to begin with.

We have really stupid dialogue and clich√©d action scenes. Satan himself is incredibly stupid. He knows about the guard being a pedophile and Jerico's wife and daughter being killed, yet he does not know the location of where Christine is.Well, if he did, we wouldn't have a movie would we? And for some stupid reason, he doesn't kill Jerico when he crucifies him. He doesn't even hammer nails through his wrists and feet.But he can't do that, cos you can't kill Arnold. He's the hero. He has to save the world.We have some pretty bad special effects. The scene where the Albino smashes into pieces looks like a PS1 game and the scene where Satan makes love to the woman and her daughter and they morph together like a Bosch painting looks unconvincing. However, Satan himself looks okay and the scene where the Church is being destroys looks good. I actually thought they built a giant church set and destroyed it all, but it was a miniature. Fooled me.Gabriel Byrne struggles with his New York accent, to the point where he gives up and does his own Dublin accent. By the way, the scene where Satan takes over Gabriel's body, he walks out of the toilet, kisses a woman and then leaves the restaurant. We then cut to inside the restaurant where we have the woman reacting to something. We then cut to outside the restaurant as it explodes. What, did Satan put an explosive inside the woman when he kissed her? Although full of flaws, I actually liked the film. I thought it was fun. I liked Arnold being Arnold, Gabriel Byrne has fun as Satan and the scene where Miriam Margoyles kicks Arnold's ass was funny.I loved the finale in the church. I thought that scene was really effective. This film came out the same year as Stigmata which also starred Gabriel Byrne. And this film features a scene with Stigmata in it. This film also came out the same year as Dogma, which although was a silly comedy, it was actually quite clever. Kevin Smith is a religious nut and it shows in his dialogue. Between those three films, I prefer Dogma. At least it knew how to be clever in it's religion topics. The whole The number of the Beast is not 666. When viewed upside down it is 999, like in 1999, the year of his return was just..........................., I'm no expert on religion, but................... really? I know you have to come with a reason for the world ending in the year 2000, but...... I dunno. I heard that Satan comes back every 999 years. I dunno. But then again, as stupid as it sounds, it IS only a movie after all. If you're expecting a clever religious film, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for Arnold fighting the devil, this is it.

Some thought that technology would fail us, plunging humanity back into the dark-ages; others predicted cataclysmic natural disasters; overzealous religious types either looked forward to The Rapture or feared the oncoming of The Antichrist.Biblical horror/action hybrid End of Days uses this last idea as the basis for its plot Arnie Schwarzenegger stars as suicidal ex-cop Jericho Cane, who finds a new lease of life when he is pitted against none other than the devil himself (Gabriel Byrne), who is in New York searching for the woman with whom he will spawn a son. Robin Tunney plays the unfortunate young lady destined to bear the devil's offspring unless Jericho can keep her safe till midnight, New Year's Eve.The hackneyed plot for this theological tosh feels almost as old as the 'good book' itself, clich√©d and predictable throughout, right down to the trite 'cat scare', the Satanic aides, and the tragic central character having lost his faith due to the tragic murder of his wife and child. Arnie is as wooden as ever (not great when his character demands an emotional tour de force), Gabriel Byrne does a poor impression of Pacino from The Devil's Advocate, and Robin Tunney is forgettable. However, despite the over-familiarity of the material and the shocking acting, End of Days actually proves to be quite a bit of fun&#x85;Hyams is an unexceptional but dependable director and he once again delivers a slick Hollywood product, ensuring more than enough overblown action and gratuitous violence to please the average Arnie fan. Memorable moments include Arnie chasing a gunman suspended from a helicopter, the star being beaten up by Margolyes of all people, the Devil punching a man right through the chest, and a spectacular train crash. The film also dares to do the unthinkable by offing Arnie at the very end, but only after he's pumped the devil full of high explosives and sent him back to Hell with his tail between his legs!Such silliness isn't going to win any awards (not even Razzies, although it was nominated for several), but it's an enjoyable enough way to kill some time.

At best, it's a piece of meaningless fluff adding nothing to the cannon of any of it's genres (action, horror, Satan looking for an excuse for some fun). And, in many ways, it doesn't really make a lot of sense.Nor should it - it's an action movie. Except for their internal logic, no action movies make sense. The point is to get on the roller coaster and enjoy the ride.And that's where I finally figured it out - for me, at least, this is an iconic roller coaster ride. Just watched it on MAX and was a little shocked at how good an action movie it is; everything just worked, even the most ridiculous bends in physical reality (which, after all, are signature to the genre).For me, the movie just flowed, beginning to end, aided by one feature that it does not share with many movies, regardless of genre. It uses dialog only when absolutely necessary. For me, this is what raises it to the level of 'favorite'. I've always regarded film as a visual media and The End of Days tells it story visually, the script is secondary. This, by itself, endears me.All movies require some degree of Suspension of Disbelief and The End of Days is no exception but, given the usual Suspension given to action movies, it becomes a virtually flawless example of its kind and a hell of a good roller coaster ride.Likes and dislikes being what they are and being tied exclusively to the individual doing the liking or disliking, I'd simply recommend 'give it a try' within the parameters demanded by its genre. You might be surprised.

The film is very dark and far from optimistic. There are some moments you can smile or even laugh, but this is not a comedy. An ex cop and a bodyguard for hire, A.S. gets into a plot which if it fully succeeds it will bring the End of Days (sorry). Yes, far fetched, but, very well acted from everyone. You just know they enjoyed making this film. There is lots of violence, some creepy sexual acts, bad language and depressing themes. Visually beautiful and audio that manages to be perfect for the film. Special effects were at the time it was released amazing and even now most of them look almost as good as then.

New York City gives End of Days a nice backdrop, it is perpetually gloomy and menacing and filled with oddballs and men and women that could quite suddenly 'do you wrong'.Unfortunately any semblance of suspense or a slow build towards a satisfying conclusion is ignored in favour of a second half that swiftly devolves into silliness, histrionics and laughable &#x96; and obviously telegraphed &#x96; twists &#x96; with a film that in retrospect rips unashamedly from the 80s action-comedy The Golden Child.()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() Arnold Schwarzenegger is Jericho Cane, a burly ex-cop with what you might think is a dumb, poorly chosen Hollywood name.

After they foil a brazen hit on an unnamed guy (Gabriel Byrne) that occurs in broad daylight, they quickly discover that they should have turned a blind eye, which would have meant a shorter film but saved me from wasting another 90 minutes.The core plot involves the usual pap of an evil guy &#x96; in this case likely THE evil guy himself &#x96; coming to Earth to mate/takeover/kill a chosen human before a pre-determined deadline. Wait what was coming up in three days? This time the target is the snake-blood chickie Christine York, now alls growneds ups, suitably cute, vulnerable and just innocent enough to not understand what is going on for around an hour despite much evidence and alarm bells going off all around her, in what turns out to be a vast 2 decade conspiracy permeating many levels of society, (and almost every non-Arnold & Christine character in the cast).I can't say what the Man has in store for young Chrissy, but whatever it is it will inevitably be sticky&#x85; Cane and Chicago make breakthrough after breakthrough in the case yet constantly remain a step behind the Man, until the film dictates that it is time for them to come together in a sh*tstorm of noise, over the top stunts and shoddy CGI effects.End of Days grows increasingly stupid the longer it goes, and at over two hours that's a whole lotta stupid. The plot developments rapidly go from inching along to ludicrous and annoying, and even mocking Arnold's thick accent tires quickly without the macho dialogue of his big-dumb-action flicks to clumsily mimic.What is perhaps worse is that Gabriel Byrne twigged early in proceedings that this wasn't going to end with an Oscar and positively snoozes his way through the film, his 'Evil guy' is so generic and lackluster that he is out-acted by Arnold Schwarzenegger!, (who really only has his bug-eyed look and jutted jaw of defiance in his arsenal in the first place).I have said it many times before, I am a sucker for thrillers, dramas and horror films with theological elements and backdrops. I find even an average effort entertaining and engrossing if they somehow inject religious and spiritual themes into proceedings.But I have my limits.Final Rating &#x96; 4.5 / 10.

Think about it - the forces of evil are unleashed on Earth and Satan himself is scouring the streets of New York looking for the virginal bride that will plunge the entire world into chaos and eternal hell fire. So an alcoholic ex-cop with a nine millimeter Glock handgun is going to stop him? Seriously, how much thought was put into this? Now I never saw this film until today, kind of appropriate I think because it's New Year's Day 2012, and later this year we'll have to get ready for the end of the world again when the Mayan Calendar runs it's course. Thoroughly familiar with the '666' Sign of the Beast concept, I just about doubled over when Rod Steiger came up with that '999' business - how could the film makers have ever foreseen Herman Cain's ill-fated economic plan an entire decade ago? I guess that's just one of the unintended bonuses of waiting until just the right time to watch an action flick in which the devil takes center stage.Now I'll give credit where credit is due. The rattlesnake blood baptism of the newborn Christine was an intriguingly creative element, but if demonic forces were already at work at the tail end of 1979, why let the kid grow up in New York City and allow the Governator to get involved? The ceiling crucifixion of the visionary assassin priest was noteworthy, as well as the creepy subway guy who shattered into pieces - both were cool effects that might have carried more weight in a better story. The same goes for the underground ancient guy with his eyelids sewn shut.But in the final analysis, none of this matters at all. I tried holding it together until the epic final battle between the forces of good and evil, when all of a sudden Arnie broke my concentration by yelling to Christine as they entered St. John's - We must lock the doors!

This is helped along by a fairly interesting plot line that allows for such high-energy action scenes to come forth, not that it's original or anything but it has more than enough applications to allow for quality moments to barrel forth, never once dragging despite it's rather long running time or allow for repeats of scenes, with the first half employed as a chase to get to her first while the second half is all about the protection she needs, with both him and the priests getting involved and generating some really good times. The extreme religious nature of such a story might turn some off, as the endless parade of Bible quotes in the middle and reapplications of faith do grow tiresome due to the quantity of such scenes, and the finale with a hokily-conceived CGI Devil isn't anywhere near convincing.

Also the film was to originally be directed by Marcus Nispel, who directed the remakes for Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, and Conan.

For one Arnold, in his best movies, was an action hero with a smile on his face. The exception to that being the Terminator movies. End of Days is much more dark than your typical Arnold movie, but then again that might be appropriate since he fighting the prince of Darkness. Though, this dark edge is largely confined to bloody violence and menacing explosions. Any sort of dark horror atmosphere or a really scary film about one of the stories of ultimate evil surfacing on Earth are put second. But does that matter? Not really. Schwarzenegger has been serving up mayhem since the 70s and he continues to do here in decent form. It is bound to please fans of the star, but others will find it just as silly as most of his other movies.And this movie is quite silly beyond its violent facade. For one, is it really that hard for Satan to find a woman to sleep with during the biggest party of the year? He goes about stalking her, killing people and blowing up cars.

It said that Arnold, after facing all kinds of enemies in his reel life, was now ready to face his greatest enemy ever - the Satan himself. This media report did manage to create interest in the movie. One would really begin to wonder how it would be to see Arnold in a movie involving the Satan himself. And my God, is the movie shallow. The movie just fails to engross you completely. At no point of time, are we convinced about the plot and the concept. In fact, there is nothing new to this movie in the form of a story. You have a chosen one, a lady chosen by the Satan himself to bear the child that would reign hell on Earth. And then you have a guy who is capable to fighting with his heart. In the form of a Satan, you get somebody who can urinate and light a fire, someone who has sex with whoever he wants. And then you have Arnold who can fight. Look what the Devil's Advocate did to the character of the Satan. We could buy him, understand him. There is no such thing here. Heck, even Lucifer in the Constantine movie was a likable character. The Satan here fails to impress. He neither makes us feel amused nor scared. Overall, the plot of the movie is not tight. The screenplay is slow. The action is meager. Arnold simply does not fit the bill to be the one who can stand up against the Satan. You would not be losing much if you managed to not see the movie, honestly. There is nothing much here. All in all, it could have been a better movie had it not gone for its own interpretation of the coming of the Satan on earth concept. A bit more depth, perhaps, a couple of sincere references to the Satan concept and the movie could have been more appealing. All in all, not a great movie to watch.

No devastating Y2K virus, no second coming of Jesus. No Satan returning to rule/destroy the world. This movie explains why; because when the Devil did show up, Arnold fought him off with a collection of machine guns and rocket launchers.That's the premise of this film, anyway, and it depicts the Devil escaping Hell per a prophecy that says he will be free at the end of 1000 years. Satan inhabits the body of actor Gabriel Byrne, a good choice because the man is indeed talented and plays the character with a certain smugness that I imagine the Devil would have. The cast overall is very good, including Arnold as the stereotypical lost his faith cop and Robin Tunney as Satan's virgin sacrifice.The movie never really makes clear what will happen if Gabriel Byrne manages to 'consumate' his relationship with Robin Tunney; just a few vague references to a lot of people dying and what the Devil calls a 'New Beginning.' Needless to say, this is not a movie you should see for the plot.If you do see it, see it to watch some reasonably entertaining good-versus-evil action with Arnold in full action hero mode; if you take it as that and not too much else you're in for a good enough time. "},{"Title":"Hell'z a popping'","Date":"10 May 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" My Take Definitely one on my guilty pleasures list. Silly, improbable and unashamedly mindless. Arnold Schwarzenegger may be the only man ever to be crucified twice. The first time was in CONAN THE BARBARIAN. He lived, now he goes through this ordeal once more in END OF DAYS, Schwarzenegger's first film after a two year absence. Starring in the millennium-end movie of 1999 is perhaps the great place for Arny to restart up his action movie career, left behind by his roles in comedies like JUNIOR and TWINS. Like other of Arny's one man army B-actioners, END OF DAYS has a helicopter chase, fist-with-fist fights, gun-play and a massive dosage of explosions. But it also includes stuff you've never seen before in Arny's films (or in any film put together). We have Arnold getting his ass kicked by an old woman, a crucifixion, his emotional side(!), and his fight in what seems to be the only foe Arnold has never fought before, The Devil himself.Of course, all this is very silly (Ayee! his emotional side!), but that's just one of the shameless guilty pleasures of this Apocalyptic thriller spearheaded with DIE HARD. The plot concerns Satan's return to Earth, seeking a bride to be the mother of the Antichrist to bring about the title event, something that the film's pseudo-religious mysticism says that he does every hundred years or so. Crazy ain't it not, but that's just one of the few pseudo-religious myths this film introduces (666 as 999, with a 1?). But accepting it exactly as what it is may help. It's a dark, and often very silly, thriller, which doesn't mean it ain't fun. Both action-packed and potentially silly, summing it up into one cheesy yet crazily fun night at the movies. It isn't in the tongue-in-cheek comedy form like Kevin Smith's DOGMA, which takes these religion hokum for jokes, END OF DAYS doesn't take the audiences will not take it seriously, and it does know how to make fun of itself.Arny plays a Chicago ex-cop Jericho Cane (take a look at those initials!), who's still in guilt of the loss of his wife and daughter, wishing that his new job, preventing assassinations, would do finish him off. If you don't buy an alcoholic New Yorker as the sole savior, then you'd better stop right here. This is not the movie for you. But Arny does get his chance at saving the world, as he is thrust to protect the 21-year old Christine York (Robin Tunney), the next broad chosen to be Satan's mistress. Satan here, first appears as a translucent floating, uh, thing which later takes the bodily form of a Wall Street Banker (Gabriel Byrne). At this time, I was asking myself why a wall street banker? Then again, why not? Kevin Pollack, Rod Steiger and Miriam Margolyes offer supporting performances.END OF DAYS is not brilliant, original or the least bit intellectual in any way. The plot gets into a derivative approach, taking a little of THE OMEN here, a bit of THE EXORCIST there, with a few dashes of ROSEMARY'S BABY and DIE HARD thrown in. Of the acting, Byrne isn't the only good actor in the film, but still the only one that doesn't give the impression of sleepwalking his role of the Devil. Director Peter Hyams, also serving as cinematographer, shakes and moves the camera off and on focus. Sometimes it's stylish, often its dizzy. Rookie screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe, who penned what may just be the best action film in long time, AIR FORCE ONE, plays with his pen and paper this time around, making what is one crazy hybrid of religion and pure Schwarzenegger-ed action fare. Silliness come at an abundance. This not the place to forage any brain food, but as is any movie of the summer. Judging as a brainless summer fodder, END OF DAYS is decent summer affair, camp and class in a package. It's fun once you know it doesn't take itself seriously. You didn't think they did this in a straight face do you? Rating *** out of 5.

Die-hard Arnie fans will defend End of Days as 'a different kind of Arnold,' but even they will exit the theatre feeling disillusioned by this uneven synthesis of a Schwarzenegger epic and a supernatural nail-biter. The humor that punctuates the usual Schwarzenegger shenanigans lacks the wit and sparkle of True Lies, Total Recall, and the Terminator movies, not even wise-acre Kevin Pollack can salvage a decent line as Arnie's partner.End of Days gets off to spooky enough start. At Vatican City in Rome, a priest witnesses a celestial spectacle called the 'eye of God.' This dreaded sighting foretells the birth of a baby marked to be the bride of Beelzebub. Instead of aborting the infant, the Pope decides to protect her. Meantime, in a New York hospital, a mother struggles to give birth. Moments after her delivery, an evil nurse carts the kid off to the morgue where a group of satanic worshippers await her. They butcher a live rattlesnake, baptize the baby with its blood, and pray over her in Latin.Twenty years zips past, and the year is now 1999. The baby girl, Christine (Robin Tunney of Vertical Limit), has become an orphan and grown up. Terrible nightmares about Old Nick haunt Christine. Satan himself sneaks into the Big Apple looking like Arnie's old nemesis from Predator. Old Nick takes over the body of an innocent man (Gabriel Byrne of The Usual Suspects), in a classy Manhattan restaurant, and then fireballs the diner to cover his trial.Enter Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger of Conan the Barbarian), a suicidal, guilt-ridden, alcoholic ex-cop who works for a corporate security firm as a hired bodyguard for its elite clientele. Is Arnold trying to change his image? His Jericho Cane borrows heavily from Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon. Cane is guarding the Man (Byrne), Satan posing as a Wall Street wizard, when an insane old priest tries to ice him. Jericho pursues the elusive assassin across the rooftops of Manhattan in a lively chase while suspended from a helicopter. Finally, he corners his quarry in the subway. Before they blast it out, the priest warns Jericho that the Devil is in town to find a woman to spawn his child.Jericho locates the priest's hideout and finds some mysterious Omen style 666 Biblical scripture scrawled in blood on the wall. Andrew J. Marlowe's script really embarrasses itself when we learn that 666 should be read not only backwards but also upside down. Add a thousand to it, and the story stipulates that Satan must walk the Earth in a human body and impregnate a virgin. Obviously, Lucifer overlooked the test tube pregnancy route. Later, he learns that Lucifer wants to mate with a virgin to have his child. Cane and Satan aren't the only ones on Christine's trail. A radical sect of priests vows to slay her before Lucifer can procreate with her. Predictably, Jericho arrives in time to rescue Christine.Director Peter Hyams lenses most of his own movies, and he photographs End of Days as if he were imitating David Fincher'sSeven. New York City emerges as dark, medieval, and ominous, and pessimism haunts the world of End of Days. Hyams is a veteran Hollywood helmer whose credits include Time Cop, Sudden Death, Busting, and The Relic. Consistently, he cranks out entertaining, above-average movies, but his films usually fall short in some respect. So far his classics have been the Billy Crystal & Gregory Hines police buddy picture Running Scared, the respectable 2010, and the grungy Sean Connery sci-fi adventure Outland. Indeed, Days has some memorable moments, but not nearly enough to redeem this 158 minute action fable.The subway scenes between Jericho, Christine, and Old Nick crackle with electricity. Occasionally, End of Days wallows in exposition that retards the plot. Hyams struggles to offset this flaw with some dazzling shoot-outs and breathless chases. The film is a dark, fiendish thriller with buckets of blood and gore. Hyams wastes little time on the film's silly theology and pours on the testosterone. The result is a muddled millennial melodrama that resembles Terminator 2 cross-bred with The Exorcist. Scenarist Andrew J. Marlowe's tedious script duplicates few of the thrills and chills that distinguished his first script, the Harrison Ford thriller Air Force One. The plot amounts to a predictable as well as obtuse puzzle that Arnie must unravel by resorting to the King James scripture. End of Days mimics The Omen and The Devil's Advocate, but it cannot overcome its formulaic origins. Action heroes that attract bullets like flies but survive the shelling because they've got on their bulletproof vest has been done to death; it no longer has shock value! End of Days qualifies at best as 'fair' were it not for several spectacular high octane action scenes and some genuinely scary moments. The cat flying out of the fridge is the best of the cheap shocks in this moody religious thriller. The offbeat casting of Arnie as a troubled bodyguard wrestling with his own demons; atmospheric cinematography and settings, and director Peter Hyams' visceral staging of the action cannot overcome the second-rate script with its pretentious religious mumbo-jumbo. Stan Winston's special effects demons would have been more at home in a Ghostbusters sequel. In End of Days, they appear not only ridiculous but obligatory. Ultimately, Schwarzenegger gets to stretch himself as an actor, but only Arnie's die-hard army of fans may feel like they haven't done a stretch.

But lets put that aside. We've got a solid story and a try to make this kind of movie different from others. My favorite scene is conversation between Jericho and Satan in Jericho's flat and the whole perception of God in Jericho's life. Also, great thing was when Satan tests Jericho and when he says that he can bring his family back to life (just like when Satan tests Jesus in desert). Maybe this movie should stick more on that kind of topics, although it gives us plenty things to think about. And Schwarzenegger (great acting if you compare it to Commando) and Byrne (great in some scenes as Satan) put really solid performances that doesn't deserve Razzie nomination. Although the whole movie isn't something special, it represents solid story and acting, with good ending, cause you cannot save the whole world without sacrifice (Jericho).

I've never been that much into Christianity, or religiousness, but the story did interest me a fair bit, and I think it's unfortunate that they had to put in so many unneeded action scenes and showy special effects to impress the mainstream audience. It could have been a very intelligent movie, had it not been for that. Oh well. I guess it's fine as it is. The plot is pretty good, but moves slowly at too many points in the movie.

I just wish they'd have eliminated a few of the pointless scenes, in order to also give the film a more suitable length, as near the end, it just seems like it's been going on for far too long, and you just want it to end quickly.

It's about the ultimate adversary, Satan himself, and of course who's the one man who can take him on? Arnie of course (!)He plays an ex-cop Jericho Cane (Decidedly subtle name I'm sure you'll agree) who's a transporter/protector for a security firm. After a routine operation goes wrong, clues lead to Cane finding himself searching for a mystery girl who seems to hold the key to the end of days as prophesised in the bible.And playing everyone's favourite bad guy is Gabriel Byrne (Yet *another* subtle name, I'm sure you'll agree - quite ironic of course in light of his role here.), who has a whale of a time as Hades, the lord of the underworld. Not quite Al Pacino (Devil's Advocate), he still manages to be pretty charismatic and believable as hell's finest.The aspect which sets this apart from most Arnie movies is that while the violence is still in evidence, you find yourself as much intruigued by the actual story as you do by how many guys he can kill. And this is this first movie Arnie's decidedly vulnerable in, and it works extremely well.The religious over and undertones won't suit everyone, but given the natue of the story you wouldn't be offended if you watched this of your own free will.  And the truth is while they're prominent, it's still a highly enjoyable story without them.The last pleasing aspect of this is that for the first time, Arnie proves he can act. Well, better than previously. He's not at all bad here, as a man haunted by his demons of the past, and scared by what he's got into, yet brave enough to keep on trying. It's definitely his best performance as a human being (He was great in T2 and T3 but the role required slightly less of him).Overall a fine movie, and without doubt a worthy addition to your collection.

As an action film, it's action packed.  As a horror film, it doesn't hold up.  Helicopter chases, gunfights, and subway explosions--it's just too much.

The lines are kinda like this Christ in New York....Christin N. York..... Christine York, that's the name of the girl!  Owww, come on, at least if Arnold's character had some kind of special mind powers or something, but it didn't. It actually lacked any kind of mind at all. How could a depressed mind blowing cop be so smart and talk like a damaged gorilla?  That part was so insulting that made me angry, and I was happy when his character died at the end of the movie. I only wished it had died it sooner, then maybe the movie could have had any chance.Well, what else can I say, when you see movies like End of Days, you really start wondering if maybe is the end of days of Hollywood, for allowing things like these to get to theatres!

It's hard to believe that so-called intelligent people started ranting and raving about the apocalypse being nigh back in the final days of 1999, but they did, and because of them we've had to endure a batch of films of this ilk. But while Strange Days took the metaphorical route of exploring society in freefall, End of Days follows a more literal interpretation of the end. Indeed, in this one, the Devil himself is unleashed upon the world and plans to destroy mankind once and for all on the eve of the new millenium.Gabriel Byrne plays Satan. He's in New York on Millenium Eve in search of a virgin who can bear his children. The unlucky lady chosen for this diabolical task is Robin Tunney. However, messed up cop Arnold Schwarzenegger has latched onto the impending threat, and takes it upon himself to protect Tunney from the hellish forces allied against her.The blood flows very freely in this movie. However, the horror side of the film is compromised because it slips too often into action movie mode. Perhaps the star and the director are too closely associated with the action genre for their own good, as they can't seem to play this one as a straight horror movie, when that is clearly how it needs to be approached in order to work. It also comes apart by giving us such a bitter and unsympathetic hero. Arnie's character is so far descended into alcoholism and despair that it becomes virtually impossible to root for him. On the positive side, there are a couple of imaginative murder scenes (the priest who is crucified to the ceiling is particularly unique, not to mention grisly) and the visual effects are very impressive. Byrne has a certain wicked flair as the Devil too.

I remember the arbitrary calculation performed in the film that gives the excuse for the appearance of Satan in 1999. Great. So the years 666, 999, 1333 and 1666 were all exempt because of what mathematical insignificance?Furthermore, yet again we have this dark and sinister branch of the Roman Catholic church scrapping their faith and running in guns blazing, not so dissimilar from the events in Stigmata as I remember. However, at least Stigmata vaguely attempted to maintain some plausibility.And finally, where does all this supernatural force come from that unleashes devastating power in the cityscape? In the context of the film, if the Guy downstairs could do this he'd be romping about every five minutes. Fortunately for us he's stuck behind the mathematical conundrum. But seriously, consider some physical and spiritual realism. If the devil comes from the supernatural and kills someone, where do they go? If they go anywhere. Or is that a paradox?Anyway, there is a future for this story line. The year 2999, on the eve of the 31st century, the loop-hole caused by the mathematical jiggery pokery rears its undecipherable head and off we go again... Terrible.

He seems to be a combination of Al Pacino in The Devil's Advocate and Robert De Niro in Angel Heart but is nowhere near as good as either. There are lots of big scale action scenes and visual effects but they are wasted on the routine and formulaic story. It's too bad about Arnold,he used to be the king of action but he lost his way somewhere down the line.

If you plan on bringing Lucifer back to power, don't you think you could somehow present it in a better form than a series of subway chases, shoot-outs, mass explosions and the like? I know I would.I liked Gabriel Byrne as Satan, but as others have complained-there doesn't seem to be any kind of consistent rules regarding the extent of Lucifer's powers. He gets driven away with machine gun fire, sent flying by a grenade launcher(?) on the subway, piledriven by same subway into another, etc. yet keeps on coming back. But you'd swear Satan could simply stop the subway cold, dodge the bullets, read Ah-nold's mind to find the girl, Something. But no.Some Spoilers Below too!!I Liked the Temptation scene-where Byrne tries to tempt him into servitude by showing him his long-dead family, ala Christ and the 40 days in the Wilderness. Some here thought Ah-nold's reaction was poorly acted. I don't think so-he was simply being himself.  But I did have a problem with Ah-nold being able to fling the Archfiend from the window to the streets 200 feet below like that. What? Catching Satan by surprise? HUH?!I liked Lucifer-as-Balrog by the way in the church towards the end-but they just Couldn't have him fighting the Dragon eh? The way Ah-nold winds up being a Sword Loser at the very end was a little goofy too. Dir. Pete Hyams tried hard to wring some pathos outta it, with Ah-nold's gurgled 'Run!' to the girl as he is being possessed, and then when he sees the souls of his Beloved and Departed....I wanted to enjoy the moment, but considering the gore, the explosions and etc preceding it was kinda hard.Some other things Rod Steiger as a priest? Ahhhh, no. And what was with the 'Stigmata of the Week' type side-show below Steiger's Church? Was this something just screaming for Python, Mad or MSTK3 treatment or what?

As an end of the world film, we need not even comment how bad End Of Days is (the scene where Schwarzenegger ponders whether he has until 1200 in general or Eastern Time till the world goes to hell says it all.) As an action movie, End of Days does even worse. For an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, its somewhat surprising that the action isn't as intense or crammed with the classic overkill factor that most viewers have come to expect.  Not to sound sarcastic, but when Arnold is on the loose, you almost expect the bad guys to show off how 'bad' they really are, only to be surprised a second later when Arnold shows up in an AV-8B jump jet guns ablazin. (Just think about how bad Arnold messed the Predator and imagine what he could have done in End of Days.) Instead, no overkill in this movie...the best that Arnold gets to ripping the bad guys a new one is him walking around with an 9mm x 19 Parabellum MP5 submachine gun equipped with an underslung M203 grenade launcher (and a glock for close encounters, respectively).Granted, I went into this movie expecting it to have a mediocre storyline and plot, but I expected more action for my money's worth.

The orgy scene between him and a mother and daughter and the way he toys with Arnold's character by recreating the murder scene where Arnold's family gets butchered; very graphic, and convincingly evil. Gabriel Byrne plays this villain, a subtle but violent when necessary Satan. Arnold plays a special unit cop with an overused storyline. Without telling to much, he's a widower now living in the dark recesses of his apartment brooding everyday and contemplating suicide. Unfortunately for Arnold, he needs to get his head back together fast enough so he can shoot and blow up whatever supernatural sh** he just got himself into. The problems I had in this film were Robin Tunney's character and Arnold trying a tad to hard to act drama. For Arnold, some moments when he goes into a lapse and flashes back to his family  I had to shake my head and turn away not in tears but in annoyance. I know what he can do. He COULD have done it with less physical emotion. I asked myself that whenever Arnold breaks down. He cranks out some good one-liners, classic, e.g. all to Satan I want you to go to hell. You son-of-a-b****!, but it's just those moments of drama that spoils it. Robin Tunney could have done more for what she was given, and it wasn't much besides playing a complete damsel in complete distress. Some of the lines she spouts were without conviction. I didn't believe her until way later in the end but by that time I couldn't care less for her character.I wouldn't rate this as high as some of Arnold's previous action films, but it's certainly better than Last Action Hero. The story isn't all too intelligent. How else do you fix a problem besides bigger guns?Regardless, I'll see a new Arnold film simply because Arnold is in it.

With regard to End of days the list could be endless.Firstly the changeling-newborn-Antichrist theme screams The Omen and Rosemary's baby from the start and it hardly tries to cover its tracks with the investigation in the barking priest's apartment scene.Combine this with the millennial gothic Seven cinematography, spooky subways √† la Jacob's ladder and even a cat for the false-start shock moments (Alien anyone?) and we are truly in compilation movie land.However, the prize for most blatant steal is yet to come.As if casting Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollack together was not hint enough, as if invoking the dropped match onto flammable liquid in slow-mo clich√© was just skirting the issue of blatancy, Peter Hyams actually allowed the paraphrase, The cleverest thing the devil ever did was convince the world he didn't exist, to be lifted from The Usual Suspects.

Unfortunately, the producers have decided that any INTENDED humour had to go, because of the `serious' subject matter.Instead, they've stolen the premise of LETHAL WEAPON, and tied it to the funny-the-first-time hook of DEVILS ADVOCATE. As if to prove he really is concerned about the effects of screen violence on his children, Arnie seems to have removed all the action as well. And what the children are led to surmise from the pompous ending - suggesting symmetry between Schwartzenegger and Jesus Christ - is anyone's guess.No doubt he'll keep making them as long as he can trade on the name - particularly in foreign markets.

But connoisseurs of these genres should be satisfied with End of Days, which combines a decent devil story with Ah-nold. The theology doesn't get in your face or trip the film up.  Gabriel Byrne makes up for his role in Stigmata by playing a ruthless Lord of the Flies, with shades of his brutal character in The Usual Suspects.  And as the trailers suggested, while Schwarzenegger is prominent from the outset, it only becomes an action pic in the last 20 minutes or so.  By then, we're almost ready for exploding subway stations.

Arnold plays Jericho Cane, a present-day New York security agent who's family has been murdered and lust for life has been squandered.  One day he is doing a routine security job for a wealthy Wall Street banker (Gabriel Byrne), when all of the sudden, a man starts shooting at the banker from a fire escape.  The assassin turns out to be a tongue-less, crazy priest, desperate to get away from the security agents.  He later turns out to be a semi-good guy who was trying to rid the world of the Antichrist, who'd infected the body of the banker.  Now this scene doesn't make sense for several reasons, in that, even if the priest had shot the banker, he wouldn't have died, because he can't be killed by any weapon, even holy objects.  Also, why would a simple Wall Street banker have gun-toting security agents clearing the way for him like he was the President?  Anyway, Saten is back on Earth for a few days, right before the turn of the Millennium, to find a woman to impregnate and bear his child.  This would mean the end of the world as we know it, and that's why the priests don't want this.  Jericho finds this chosen woman before Saten does, and he tries to protect her.  The movie leads up into about fifty different climaxes at the end and left me feeling rather bored, not exhilarated.  Anyway, the movie is predictable, violent, graphic, and unintelligent, but for a Schwarzenegger film, it wasn't half bad.

I am confused by the way that he looks.  He is almost always a policeman or an ex-policeman, a soldier or an ex-soldier (green beret or commando or special forces or black ops whatever that is) - twice he was a research scientist, twice a bodyguard or something, twice an ordinary father, and once he was jungle boy that had a twisted little dwarf as his brother.  Twice, of course, he was a robot and that actually makes sense with how he looks, robots can look and sound as ridiculous as they want to (Robin Williams has now been a robot case closed), the same goes with the two times he was a pre-Christian barbarian.  But more often than not, Arnie is a human being that happens to move and look like a pre-kiln slab of river clay.  There is never an explanation as to why he sounds as he does nor of how he finds the three or four hours a day to work out.  Just once I'd like an explanation of how a boy raised in New York, third generation Irish cop, would sound like he just rolled down a mountainside after bugling through a giant horn.Thus we are introduced to Arnie in End of Days.  He is Jericho Cane (I guess Golgotha Christ was too much of a mouthful) - and he is sitting in his giant New York apartment, holding a gun to his head.  Again - how do these out of work losers afford the $5000.00/month rent in these places?  First thought in my mind is that this was a pretty good introduction to a cop (or ex-cop in this case) the first time I saw it when it was called Lethal Weapon. Immediately, you know that his wife has been killed, his kid has been killed, or he's accidentally shot a child in the line of duty (both his wife and child were killed, incidentally).  Soon his pithy partner, the increasingly unwatchable Kevin Pollack, shows up, looks concerned at the gun on the coffee table, makes appropriately gaggy faces when Arnie slams a mixer concoction of chinese takeout and pepto bismol, and gamely does his best Tom Arnold impersonation for the remainder of the film.What's this movie about, though?  It's one of the many films that opened near the end of 1999 to capitalize on the sudden interest in the apocalypse shared by Hollywood and about 1000 cult members in Uganda.  It's about the return of Satan to New York city where he hopes to impregnate THE CHOSEN ONE by the stroke of midnight, Eastern standard time, and hasten the, ready? End of days.  It's about young Christine York (Christ-in-new York - get it? No, me neither), who is born with a sorority tattoo, baptised in rattlesnake blood, and raised by Udo Kier and another unattractive servant of Satan in an upscale Brownstone at Central Park West.  Really, though, the movie is about Arnold shooting 10,000 rounds into Satan and here's the punchline, actually slowing Him down.Satan is played by the terminally dull Gabriel Byrne.  Byrne is some sort of investment banker or something that is possessed by Satan three days before the turn of the century.  As Satan, he seems to have the ability to blow up tony New York cafes with a smoldering glance, to p**s gasoline, and to survive falls of ten stories and more.  He does not seem to be able to move faster than the comically lugubriously uncoordinated Arnold.  We assume that it's important that it be Byrne's investment banker sperm that finds its way into Christine York, thus lending some kind of explanation as to why Satan is so enamored with that particular body rather than jumping around from body to body like the demon in Fallen.  This doesn't seem to be the case, however, because, and I don't feel like I'm giving much away here, Satan jumps into Arnold when Gabriel Byrne's body's been trashed.  Arnold, I mean Satan (mercy, it's all so very confusing!), then proceeds to try to rape Christine York with only 9 seconds remaining in 1999.  While I'm sure that Arnold can rip one off in 9 seconds, what boggles the mind is that he tries to get a nice kiss first.  That's charmingly old fashioned, don't you think? Like swabbing Sean Penn's arm with alcohol in Dead Man Walking before injecting him with potassium sulfate.There's also the bit about a Vatican priest-turned-assassin named Thomas Aquinas that unsuccessfully tries to shoot Gabriel Byrne in the beginning of the film.  He apparently believes, as Charlton Heston believes, that the best way to combat a manifestation of evil is with a good gun at his side. What kills me is that no one seems to have a moment of frission with the name Thomas Aquinas.   I don't claim to be an expert in theology, but the name rings a bell.  It does not ring a bell with the cast (and nor does it ring the bells of the myriad fans of this film, I venture).Who's the guy in the hospital? Thomas AquinasThat's a bizarre conversation.  I kept waiting to hear this oneWho's the guy in the hospital? John the BaptistIt's appropriate in both instances that someone take note of strangeness. Taking note of strangeness is a very important function in film.  If the film doesn't know that it sucks, there are certain irritating people in the audience (like myself) that will.  And it does.  Suck, I mean.End of Days is that most unforgivable of films.  It is the kind of film that urges us to leave our brains at the door and hold on for the ride - to remember when we were eight years old again.  In other words, it asks us to be mentally challenged, emotionally immature, and so beaten by the onward marching tide of culture that we are wholly incapable of not liking something that cost 100 million dollars.  How Schwarzenegger remains a top box office draw is an uneasy combination of the vast foreign box office that think that Arnold somehow embodies the U.S. and (heck, he does) capitalism, and the gleaming hope for a third installment in the Terminator series. It certainly can't be for such triumphs as Jingle All the Way, Eraser, Batman & Robin, Junior and Last Action Hero.At its best, End of Days joyfully invites heckling and flabbergasted looks - at its worst, End of Days is almost as aggressively condesending as Phantom Menace.  Still and all, when excretia such as this earns its studio a tidy profit and truly wonderful films like Wonder Boys spends a quick two month run at the multi-plex, we deserve what we get.

He seems to have made an about-turn in his approach to making films, although to some extent it is sad to see the Arnie of old leaving - he seems incapable of handling serious roles because of his inane stupidity and sheer size.

It is the story of Satan's attempt to rise and destroy the world as we know it by mating with a woman and producing an offspring.  We see the birth of the chosen baby girl as the pope and cardinals, who have read the signs, plan to find her and protect her from Satan.  The film jumps to the present and we are introduced to Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and an adult Christine York (Robin Tunney), Satan's intended.  The devil takes control of an investment banker's body (Gabriel Byrne) and with the aid of his sycophantic followers proceeds to stalk Christine for the mating ritual.  Meanwhile Jericho finds Christine and assigns himself as her protector.  The rest of the film is one big chase scene, as Jericho and Christine run from Satan as well as the clerics who want to kill her to prevent the union.The story is pretty flimsy.  It is really nothing more than a vehicle for Arnold to strap on some firepower and wreak mayhem in his return to the action genre.  In the featurette included on the DVD, writer Andrew Marlowe states flat out that he wrote this script specifically for Arnold.  But WOW, as vehicles go, this was a supercharged nitro burning dragster of a movie.Peter Hyams puts together some of the best action footage I can remember.  Overall, his photography was fantastically potent.  The technique, camera angles, lighting and use of filters to create various effects were all terrific.  But more importantly, his pace was excellent.  This film never lets up.  There are rest stops from the action, but no real lulls.  The visual effects in this movie were outstanding.  There were pyrotechnics, digitally created creatures, and exploding models that were so realistic that I didn't pick up they were models until I checked out the bonus features on the DVD (The bonus pack was great.  It included a fascinating section on how all the visual effects were produced).  The sound design was also excellent (though a bit overly loud at times) and made full use of all five speakers.Schwarzenegger returns to top form as undisputed king of the action genre.  There was much speculation that, after his heart surgery, if he acted at all it he would be relegated to nothing more strenuous than roles like &#145;Kindergarten Cop'.  This film completely removes all doubt.  Arnold is pumped back up and takes on his biggest challenge yet, in a physically demanding role fighting a foe that can't be killed.  That doesn't mean he doesn't try, pouring out projectiles like a fountainhead of fire.  This part was written in a way that made Arnold's character a lot more human; actually fighting off despair.  He handled this nuance extremely well.This is probably Robin Tunney's biggest part in a feature film and she does a nice job.  Her character didn't have a lot of range; just look scared, upset and helpless and make Arnold look strong.  She did this well, helped considerably by how petite she is compared to Arnold.I thought Gabriel Byrne took the wrong approach to his character.  He is a terrific actor, but he played this role a bit too flippantly, like a sardonic wise guy rather than the evil prince of darkness.  Also, his New York accent was an awful attempt to hide his charming Irish brogue.Viewers should use discretion before seeing this film.  Anyone who is put off by gratuitous graphic violence, gore, nudity, profanity and sexual situations should avoid this film.  But this film is a must see for action fans and especially for Arnold fans.  I rated it an 8/10 in spite of a weak story.

Of course, because of this, all the religious freaks are out to kill her - not with cop Jericho Cane (Ahnuld) on the case. He protects her, guarding her and even keeping her hidden when he is being tortured by Satan himself, played with cunning sharpness by Gabriel Byrne, who has had a great year with religious thrillers (the stunning 'Stigmata' with Patricia Arquette, and this). A favorite scene of mine is early on, when Gabriel goes to the bathroom in a restaurant to go to the bathroom, then washes up, only to be thrown around and posessed by the Beast. With Satan now in him, Gabriel walks out to his table, where his colleagues await him, and he grabs ahold of the woman's breast, plants a hard passionate kiss on her lips, then walks outside -- the whole place EXPLODES behind him as he walks off with a smirk on his face. That's Satan for you! I appreciated the color schemes used in this film, and loved the eerie cinematography - great use of angles in the hospital room after Satan has crucified priest Thomas to the ceiling, using medical scissors.

I was pleased that Arnold's character was flawed and had emotional and spiritual issues that he struggled to deal with.  This created a deeper and more interesting hero.

There are some I saw that coming moments but they don't detract from the story unless that's a pet peeve of yours.  For parents there are some brief sexual scenes and a bit of sexually oriented language so this is not one for the kiddies.

The problem is, the special effects are not brilliant, so audiences just go, Yeah, so a restaurant blew up- I've seen it before. Films such as 'Titanic' and 'The Matrix' astound people, and can somewhat justify the exorbitant costs that go into making their special effects. This is simply another action flick which few can muster up the energy to get involved in. Especially when the plot is so crappy. The only commendable aspect of this film is Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of the devil, but still, the script he has to work with is so poor, that he cannot save this waste of money. And what about the climax of the film, when Satan has about 15 seconds left to impregnate the girl. The audience is supposed to be on the edge of their seats, wondering if he'll do it, but all they're thinking about is how on earth Satan is going to root her in 15 seconds. They would have had to speed the film up to Benny Hill pace. That actually would have added to this outstandingly mediocre film.

I have always had a soft spot for Arnold and action films and so I waited in rapt anticipation of the opening of End of Days.  I was not expecting Shakespeare mind you, just a solid supernatural/action/thriller.  Instead, I got this film.I don't actually know when this film went wrong.  I think it was probably at the level of screen-writing, but I can't say that the directing was all that good either.  This film was painful to watch almost from the beginning; it never built to anything... just one scene after another with no conception of flow or even continuity.  Where were the massive crowd scenes (like in Strange Days), where were the scary parts, maybe even some gore, or some moralising (this was, after all, a film based on Christian mythology).  The best way that I can describe this film is that it contained a bunch of interesting elements, but never bothered to work them together in a satisfying way.  None of the ideas ever seem to touch each other, and Arnold is left in the middle holding the bag.Also, as a side note (and I am NOT one of those sticklers who feels the need  to criticise films for their lack of historical accuracy; I don't care if they use the right type of sword in Braveheart, as long as the film is good)  Why do movie makers find the need to make films about Christian Apocolyptical and then IGNORE the actual Christian ideas?  A film based on actual Christian mythology (like The Excorcist) would have been far more interesting than what  they made up for End of Days.  Christian mythology is FULL of all kinds of neat story ideas that never seem to get plumbed by the people who make these movies.... oh, well.

There was a lot of madness leading up to that event, and this movie was certainly taking advantage of that mentality.  But nothing really happened on that night, and so all the movies about the possible tragedies of the millennium seem almost silly.This was by far Arnold's darkest movie.  The scenes in the home of the crazy priest who was trying to kill the Satan character were right out of Seven, or even Summer of Sam.  Dark, dank and very ugly places that you wouldn't wish on a heroin addict, let alone a priest portrayed as the hand of God.  There was a relentless darkness to this part of the movie.The chase scenes seemed to wear me out.  Maybe I prefer watching chases in San Francisco.  They are always very exciting.  This was by far Arnold's most challenging role.  He took on the role of anti-hero, an area usually ruled by Bruce Willis.  Arnold was an alcoholic, bitter man, who tried to turn it all around throughout the movie.  Arnold pulled it off for my dollar.  The ending was uplifting, even agonizing.This was a difficult movie to put my finger on.  I got all of the action that I normally expect from Arnold, but just a little too dark for my taste.

What I had hoped this film would be was an insightful journey into the mind of a man who's lost his faith in God, and must fight Satan, evil incarnate, at the same time.  I was hoping that after the guns didn't work, Jericho would turn inward and find something within himself that could defeat the Devil.  Sadly, throughout the entire film, we find Arnie in his A Bazooka Solves Everything mode as he goes after the girl, armed to the teeth and ready to blow the head off of any malevolent deities that get in his way.  YAWN.  The climax of the film is the most disappointing of all. The depiction of the Satan creature was trite and cliched, and the way Arnie defeats him was SOOOOO lame.

End of Days brings forth an end to those days of wondering where has Arnold Schwarzenegger been. Well, Arnold's back. This movie is about the end of 1999 and the behind the scenes struggle taking place between good and evil. While we are all worried about bank cards not working or wondering if they'll have gas at McDonald's so we can still get a burger...others (at like the Pope's level) are worried about the devil getting loose and wrecking havoc for the next 1000 years. While watching this film, I kept thinking where are all the records? Someone had to have taken notes of what happened the night 999 ended (I suggest we look for them near old Y1k compliant stickers). However Arnold is neither of the above, he doesn't care about his bankcard nor does he seem to worry about good vs evil. He just wants to have a few drinks, break a few heads, and make some cash. That is until he meets the devil. The devil has the nerve to get a bit arrogant with Arnold (imagine the gall) and in the process ticks him off. If the devil thought the Pope was gonna be tough New Years Eve, he couldn't begin to imagine what Arnold was going to do. This film is pretty good, but obviously some connecting scenes must have ended up on the cutting room floor...for example, we initally see a very visible local priest (played by Rod Steiger) who literally disappears from view by the film's end and we don't know why?

Alas, End of Days is anything but a simple straightforward action flick.   Confused, chaotic, and too complicated by half, you could say it's a very holely movie.Playing on our since-subdued millennial angst, End of Days is about Satan rising from the depths of hell to trigger the apocalypse just as the crystal ball in New York's Times Square hits bottom to mark the transition from 1999 to 2000.But the story centres on an alcoholic ex-cop turned body guard, played by the Austrian Oak, who, having lost his family to a gang of thugs, has abandoned all hope, all faith in humanity and in God,and is on the verge of suicide.Just as he's about to put a bullet in his noggin, his partner and side-kick knocks on the apartment door, not only inadvertently prolonging his life but putting him on a new assignment, to protect a slimy stock broker from some enemies he's made.Little do they know that said stockbroker is actually Satan, played by Gabriel Byrne, who is bent on impregnating the `chosen woman' and thereby open the gates of hell. Why a being so powerful as the Prince of Darkness needs bodyguards, let alone the body of a stockbroker to have sex, are just a few of the many head-scratchers.Leaps in logic aside, what's truly sinful is the lack of action -- both the good guy and the bad guy are surprisingly wimpy. What's a loser boozer doing taking on the Angel of Darkness? And why does it take no more than a few high-powered weapons to put ol' Beelzebub out of commission and resorting to plan B, which, strangely enough, is to coerce our hero to do the nasty on his behalf?The whole idea, the whole premise, is wrong, wrong, wrong.Instead of some maudlin and meandering search for the inner-Arnold, those behind this fiasco should have stuck with what Schwarzenegger does best -- action. Rather than casting him as a messed up drunk, why not as God's super-angel, sent down from the heavens to do battle with the forces of darkness? And instead of using New York as the setting, how about a location a little more synonymous with the End Time, say...Armageddon? (It's a real-live place, after all).In true Miltonian fashion, Arnold and his fellow guardians would wage epic war against the rebellious Beelzebub and his Army of Darkness, while we mortals huddle in our hiding places, peaking out every once in awhile to see who's smoting who with their flaming swords.Better yet, why not just forget the whole idea altogether and work on a sequel to Total Recall?

I couldn't care Robin Tunney's situation of living for the past 20 years dreaming of making love with Satan.  Arnold plays the kind of broken hero that usually suits Bruce Willis, and he plays it well, too bad the script degenerates and doesn't allow further exploration.  The writers could have played up the Faustian deal some more by not making Arnie's character, who's supposed to have a lost faith in God, into a totally determined say no guy from the beginning.  Instead some silly stuffs have to crop up and taken seriously (and executed ineffectively) like the truth about 666.  Also plot developments happen and then never explained especially how is it that Thomas Aquinas could talk without his tongue.  The climax is obviously shoe-horned so that it is faith that will eventually defeat the devil.  Earlier in the movie, it is mentioned that the devil will choose a particular mortal to take over and only that mortal can impregnate Robin Tunney.  The movie Armageddon also had huge gaping plotholes, but at least the movie was fun.Gabriel Byrne's performance of Satan having a talk with Arnie is one of the highlights of the film.

Mr. Schwarzenegger's visit to Australia in early December 1999 just added fuel to the interest level, as did all the hype about changing the plot to appease certain religious circles. Overall I thought that Mr. Schwarzenegger didn't exhibit the passion (i.e. the hunger) he presented in his earlier films and the acting of the other players was wanting; Mr. Gabriel Byrne has been much better is his other flicks like The Usual Suspects. Mr. Kevin Pollak saved the day however on the acting front. The screenplay and direction were below par; the special effects were OK. Given that the film was released a week or so ago, the size of the audience at the theatre was disappointing. I really hope that Mr. Schwarzenegger's next films will be better and I looking forward to seeing Total Recall 2 when it is released.

Yes, the special effects are good as usual but if the producers had spent just a fraction of that money on a good script, this could have been something above average. I personally think that Arnold is wrong for this story. It requires a strong (i.e. charismatic NOT physically strong) actor to drag the main character into the story, and in my humble opinion he just doesn't pull it off. The rest of the cast is doing a good job.  Kevin Pollak (as the cynical partner) add a little extra to a roll that I personally would have liked to see expanded. Robin Tunney, C.C.H Pounder, Rod Steiger and Udo Kier all make good performances and Gabriel Bryne is excellent as the devil (when he is allowed to act the roll).Thus you have a (generally) good cast and a big budget so why doesn't this movie lift off? In my opinion it's because the story (and maybe the producers) doesn't dare to show things in more colors than Black vs. White. There is no gray scales whatsoever. Why is it that American films so often seem to think that Evil must be portrayed as an absolute evil? Bryne's roll should have been so much more convincing if he had been allowed to play it more dark gray. By giving the devil more of a human character you will actually be more scared of him since he will be less predictable and more like yourself.  There is an attempt to do this with the White side but unfortunately it fails, still that intention was good. (What could have made this even more interesting would have been to include a few atheists in some of the scenes, completely unaffected by the whole thing since it is based on faith...)So, if you feel that you have some spare money and like to see good special effects then maybe this movie is for you. However don't expect to be told a good story.

And a big one. Arnold Schwarzenegger chose another fine script, and his acting, together with Tunney¬¥s, is what keeps this picture from falling completely into the abyss. The Austrian Oak is now becoming a very good actor, at last. He has been improving enormously since he shot Eraser. He¬¥s now showing other facial capabilities and does not rely so heavily on his physique anymore. As for the movie and its story... We¬¥ve seen similar stories before, and some of those stories (particularly one with Demi Moore and Jurgen Prochnow, The SEventh Seal(??)) are very good, very effective.This one mixes two genres the religious mistery and the action thriller. Some may think these genres do not mix, but I think they can mesh perfectly if the director pays attention to details. That¬¥s the problem with End of Days. A matter of details.ATTENTION THE FOLLOWING MAY CONSTITUTE SPOILERS...A matter of details. Yes. We can never believe this story is about the devil (who takes on a human body and has super-powers (absorbing bullets, going through seas of flames unarmed, surviving falls from 20 stories buildings) if the devil, and its human form, with its super-powers, cannot survive a train crash, or cannot avoid a fall from am high window...Sometimes he is superpowered, at other times he is not. It¬¥s ilogic, and removes all credibility from the story.The director (Peter Hyams) chose a path dictated perhaps by merchandising or today¬¥s trends bang-bang, noise-noise, non-stop physical action. He chose to shock viewers, to awe them, instead of making them think and climb to their seats in fear. The Devil pisses oil or gasoline, wow, he smashes heads with a single strike...he knows everybody¬¥s thoughts but cannot foresee or know the location of the girl - he has to beat Arnold¬¥s character up or has to lure him into a sentimental trap in order to get that information.Maybe it¬¥s just me, but someone in Hollywood thinks we (the viewers) are not up to the task of understanding complex ideas in a movie, so that very powerful someone shoots us with shallow scripts and movies.The motiv of this picture is great, the beggining is also great...but all these things become of little importance when all the shooting begins and the Devil¬¥s followers turn into an enormous mob out of the blue.Robin Tunney is very good in her part; Gabriel Byrne is an average devil (compare his intensity with Pacino¬¥s in The Devil¬¥s Advocate) - he is an outstanding actor - and the rest of the cast performs well.Special effects - solid, but normal.The soundtrack is very good and adds interest to the movie.The one thing that redeems the movie is the last scene Jericho fighting the devil the only way he can...The ending is superb, unlike the happy ending so common in Arnold¬¥s movies.I rate it a 6 out 10.

Nonetheless, another fine performance from Byrne.Kevin Pollock delivers a great performance as Canes' partner in arms, Chigago, providing some fantastic comic elements to the movie to loosen up the audience after one of the man tense sequences.Robin Tunney *most memorable as Sarah Bailey in The Craft* is Christine York, the doe-eyed damsel in distress who has been selected by Beezlebub to bear his child. Although she is not given much more to do other than look frightened or run screaming, she was quite good working with what she was given.So, with the new millennium coming up within less than 3 days, you could think of this movie as A) A sign of doom B) A welcome back vehicle for Arnie or C) A joy ride filled with good special effects, intriguing topics and actors having a ball playing their characters.I give End of Days **** out of ***** "},{"Title":"An entertaining way to end it all.","Date":"27 December 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  If the World had to be saved I'd rather it were saved by 'Arnie' and if it had to end he'd certainly make it a more spectacular and entertaining finale.

Substantial gore and special effects were balanced by an average-to-good acting performance from all concerned, Byrne in my eyes was a decent choice as The Dark Prince and he carried the part quite well. Full marks to Hyams for the unexpected ending, but it was not one that Arnie was suited to as viewers will no doubt see. The scene of Arnie taking on the mob in the alley and the temple scene evoked pleasant memories of Eraser and Terminator 2, but such parallels were too fleeting and too few.

Satan has returned looking for a bride who has been in safe keeping all her life for him to come and impregnate her.

He is actually trying to grips with himself much the same as Riggs is in the original Lethal Weapon. With a little more coaching I think that Arnie could have pulled it off.

This was at the end of a long film, when by all ordinary standards we should have been gladly on our way home, but somehow it worked - it was just more fun.	Well the End Of Days, the latest Arnold Scwarzenneger starring vehicle, lives and especially dies on the other end of the Arnie Spectrum. It takes only a few minutes to realise that this flick is rubbish and won't recover.	And it reportedly cost $100 Million U.S. to make! How can you spend so much money and come up with a dud?Just goes to show that the movie moguls aren't as smart as they'd like to have their share holders believe. I think that we can safely not blame Arnold Scwarzenneger. He's been in enough successful films and shown his wit and intelligence, not to mention his muscles, often enough to not slate this debacle to him.The Terminator films, True Lies, Twins,  Kindergarten Cop, Total Recall, The Last Action Hero, Junior and Predator have long established his screen presence and in particular his ability to gently mock himself.And it doesn't appear that Arnie has got too old for parts like the drunken ex cop/action hero he plays in End Of Days. He looks fine and doesn't look like he's lost his touch. But a woeful script, which gives the appearance of having been half completed, sank this sad ship well and truly.Perhaps the script was hurried because End Of Days is set in the last weeks of 1999 and to open in late 1999. I can right now appreciate the pressure of end of year deadlines!There isn't much that is new in this film. It's full of cliches. The devil is attempting to take over the world. This for some reason happens every 1000 years. In addition the insurrection has some ridiculous conditions.Satan has to sire a child with an appropriately anointed and prepared woman in the last hour before the end of each 1000 years. This allows Satan to be appropriately lascivious and in a hurry, a somewhat fraught condition. I'd expect you'd agree.He whooshes forth in something of the style of the Terminators well known to movie fans and then takes over a male body so that he can have congress with his bride.Scwarzenegger playing Jericho Cane (note the initials) gets mixed up in the deal when a crazed priest tries to kill the body in which Satan has chosen to do his evil deeds (played by Gabriel Byrne). Jericho Cane is some sort of unofficial, reluctant (Lethal Weapon) bodyguard.The woman (Christine played by Robin Tunney, The Craft) is of course young and pretty and you can see just where this film is going.There will be hooded priests (headed by Rod Steiger of all people) and a wise cracking sidekick for Arnie (the very good Kevin Pollack). A lot of the action will happen  in churches and the regulation, true, terrifying appearance of Satan will appear in front of the altar at the climax of the film. And of course Arnie will win.There were some good moments. Satan's description of God as a woeful under achiever with good Public Relations was cute and some of the fighting sequences were O.K. but there are major glitches and they destroy the enjoyment of the movie.Very often the action is just not believable. For instance there's an early sequence when Arnie is suspended on a rope from a helicopter while he chases a villain, but the surrounding crowd hardly seem to notice.The chopper is shot at from point blank range with almost no effect. A number of times gunmen lurch into the action from no where with alarmingly good timing.Again and again baseball bat wielding thugs appear strangely on cue and do almost nothing. It's sometimes like a badly worked out, inept, amateur theatrical presentation.And Satan seems to be able to alternately take major hits from bullets, throw big men across rooms, and then let himself be thrown out of a window!End Of Days within it's first twenty minutes loses credibility and then doesn't improve. And as an ultimate insult it features a particularly tasteless scene, one that is certainly not unique in the annuls of movie land, but one that I wish the clich√© scroungers would shift to the bottom of the drawer to be never again exposed.The thrust of End Of Days is the rape of a woman. Why should this yet again be the instrument and the substance of the prize, even for the Devil?Having Arnold Scwarzenneger doing, or even about to do the deed, is in very poor taste.

I must say I really liked cinematography and set design. The fights and action sequences are more subdued than other Schwarzenegger films such as Predator or True Lies. I think the action scenes required a director with more panache. But, I did love the fight in rain, It was strange seeing Arnie really get beaten down. The traditionally heroic characters he plays mean this scene has a real impact.It would be hard for anyone to claim this film had a good script. I would have preferred if the filmmakers had gone the whole hog and left out the traditional on liners and made the film really bleak. What we end up getting is a muddled narrative which is a means to an end for Peter Hyams to play about as Cinematographer and for Arnold to try a more challenging role.

I find it hard to believe, especially how they are coming up with all this technical BS. Who cares! It's an Arnie movie! You don't exactly go into an Arnie movie looking for the perfect plot, great acting, etc. You go in for some gun fights, explosions, and Arnie kicking the living c**p out of somebody. Well, at least that is what I go in thinking. This movie surprised me with the deep plot and Arnie actually doing possibly his best acting as a human (excluding the Terminators). The first hour and 50 minutes of the movie was excellent, but there were a few holes and the ending was mediocre, but oh well, nothing can be perfect. A few things I didn't care for too much in the movie, was, I didn't think that Arnie's partner (Pollack) got enough time. He reminded me a great deal of Tim Arnold in True Lies, but they didn't really develop him enough. It was just basically, he's in and out. If they added another 30 or so minutes it might have been a much better movie, but then again, that might have caused this nonstop action movie to drag just a bit, because how much action can you possibly stuff into one movie. This movie also has some excellent scenes, I am not gonna spoil the ending for people who haven't seen it, but it was sort of a disappointment. I was expecting something HUGE to top everything off, but instead, we got something much less. That, in my opinion, is what made this movie a Very Good movie instead of an Excellent movie. This movie is #4 on Arnie's all time list behind the Terminators and Predator.

I felt that Gabriel played the role of the devil far better then the cute creature which was seen at the end. I thought that they should have ended the film with the devil reigning supreme.

It even has one nearly great scene, a verbal face off between Arnie and Byrne in Arnold's apartment. Where the film completely loses it is in the final third. Watching the film was fun up until then , even though it was mostly through spotting how many other films had been plagerised throughout. Then we have a rip off of The Exorcist and Gabriel Byrne is replaced by an unconvincing CGI effect, and the result is as boring as it is a letdown.

Arnold's mission is to keep the devil's prospective bride away from him during the final hour of the millennium.  He ends up constantly fleeing the devil and his minions in a manner reminiscent of the escape in Terminator 2.Although Arnold's faith is renewed at the end of the film, there is little here to convert anyone else.  The Catholic church is divided in its strategies for confronting the devil, and it cannot offer the resolution that a single man with a pure heart can bring.  The Exorcist this is not, as the film does not challenge or provoke religious beliefs and feelings. The devil might just as well be another archvillain with macabre superpowers. The special effects are excellent, however, with many fireballs, a transparent devil image in motion, and finally a clear view of the devil in full color in the final confrontation.The supporting actors leave an impression, especially the devil's bride to be and Arnold's buddy in the protection business, but the real stars are Arnold and the devil.  The devil is a handsome dark-haired man who resembles a young Al Pacino in his intensity and the controlled expression he wears on his face as he causes other to burn and perish in agony. Arnold appears as a depressed drunk who wears a trenchcoat and contemplates taking a bullet to hasten his own end.

The man delivers his good as the Satan and carries out a particular look through out the movie that can convince you that this man isn't good.

Such a big comet should have been oserved by astronomers several months, if not years, before it reached that size.

Of course I went in the movie theater with very low expectations and to be somewhat entertained and in that sense I got just what I expected. Although not quite as awful as say the most recent The Bone Collector, End of Days is not that good either.  Low expectations work every time.  As far as I am concerned there hasn't been a superb Satan movie since 1973's classic, The Exorcist and to this date nothing has even come remotely close.  End of Days does not even try, but it does take from not only The Exorcist but heavily from The Omen and Rosemary's Baby too.  So mix those three excellent films together, take out the good parts, thrown in a lot of biblical and prophecy nonsense, add gigantic special effects, toss in the idiotic millennium ploy, contract a horrible action star to play the lead role, say Van Damme, Stallone, or Schwarzenegger (Arnold's the winner here) and you get the jest of this flick.Schwarzenegger plays Jericho Crane, a suicidal, alcoholic ex-cop who is now in the protection business assigned to watch over a Wall Street Banker (Gabriel Bynre).  For reasons unknown, as is usual for these types of movies, Satan possesses Bryne.  Bryne is in search of the chosen young girl, Christina (Robin Tunney), born twenty years ago during some strange celestial alignment that only the Pope and his gang are able to decipher.  Satan needs to impregnate Christina between 11pm and midnight on December 31, 1999 so that the gates of hell will open and the world as we know it ends. Yea, we heard this before.  In the most ridiculous and ludicrous Biblical babble, a priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho and Christina that the symbols and numbers of the devil are usually upside down or sideways in dreams, hence 666 becomes 999 (how convenient).  How this fits into 1999, except 999 being the last three digits, is beyond any logic. Well anyway we have the match of the century or should I say millennium between Satan and the muscle bound ex-cop.  What starts off as somewhat interesting just gets worse and worse until the final confrontation, which looks like the cutting room floor of The Terminator.  Although not convoluted like most films in this genre, too much does not make sense.  Why was Bryne's character chosen to begin with, if the Vatican knew about this why weren't they Y2K compliant and if Satan is not able to die by bullets, subways cars, etc. what is that ending all about.  With films like this, why even ask, the best that you can hope for is to be entertained.  But End of Days is not really that entertaining.Schwarzenegger is at his worst here as the ex-cop with mental problems whose wife and daughter were killed.  This seems like a major stretch for the strongman, but when you really look at it the only reason for making the character suicidal and alcoholic was cause it probably looked good on paper.  Other wise with the exception of Jericho aiming a gun at his head in the beginning and major pill containers on his dresser, there isn't much there. Maybe that's a good thing because Arnold can't even pull off the little bit that he has to work with.  He has never been more boring or stiff as he is here.  Gabriel Byrne, who can be very good at times, should have taken a lesson from Al Pacino's  over the top performance in The Devils Advocate.  Satan has never been less menacing or interesting as Bryne here portrays him.  Bryne basically sleep walks through this role and is almost a bore as Schwarzenegger.  Piece of advice Gabriel, fire your agent.  Kevin Pollak is basically wasted as Arnold's partner and the total lack of chemistry between the two does not help. Poor Rod Steiger, an actor of great talent, has probably one of the worst records in picking film projects.  He is not bad here, but by all means it does not show off the actor who wooed audiences in the macabre 1968 film, No Way to Treat a Lady were he played a flamboyant serial lady-killer.  Maybe he needed the paycheck, other wise I can't figure out what he was doing in this mess.This picture could have been much better with rewrites and a competent actor in the lead role.  But I guess the executives thought that Arnold would be a draw.  The thing is this is not the type of movie that Schwarzenegger fans go to see and the devil/horror fans don't want to see Arnold, so I don't know whom this movie was marketed for.  Either way fans of each will be disappointed.  I think what sold this picture to the head honchos was the millennium theme, since it does not come around every other year.One last gripe.  Why can't a movie that takes place in New York, but filmed on Los Angles sets make an attempt in realism.

After all, Arnold is the apparent king of the action genre. I was stoked to see Gabriel Byrne play The Man (Satan). I was even curious to see Robin Tunney (who I have always thought was under rated).What I found in this film was instead was a mess of references. 1) Gabriel Byrne in a suit and overcoat, urinating in public at night and the slow motion scene of him dropping the cigarette. 2) The closeup of Kevin Pollack face lit up shortly before he meets apparent doom. 3) The priest's reference, The greatest trick the devil ever pulled... I was left wondering what Hyams was trying to do with such overt references.Unlike many of the contributors here I found the fx to be tedious and redundant. I was irritated by the overused fireball and explosion fx. Been there seen it done better.While I enjoyed Byrne's performance, I feel like the script never really gave him the chance to do much. He never quite got the malicious glee that Nicholson ( Witches of Eastwick) and Sydow (Needful Things) made so integral to the character. I blame this on a script that allowed him lots of action sequences but few opportunities to act.Arnold...Yeah uh huh when I think of action stars that can pull off the fallen hero archetype he's at the top of my list...suuuure. A.S. is woefully miscast in a role that would've been much better served by Val Kilmer, or half a dozen other actors.Robin Tunney has too much physical vitality to pull off the wounded introspective victim. Hopefully she will at least gain some visibility from this project that will lead to more credible work.In the end, the film tries to make some vague statement about the strength of faith, but it is quite simply too little too late.

The Catholic church is up to its neck in stigmata's.  Even the devil himself (as played by that thing from Predator) has come to town to get lucky! The only thing that can save us is a tough ex-cop, now a bodyguard, who has lost his faith in religion over the past few years because his wife and daughter were violently murdered.  Oh God Help Us!  I suspect that End of Days will be significant only because it marks the beginning of the end of Arnold Swartzenegger's days as an action hero.  Arnie plays Jericho Cane (and if you think that's the only cheap biblical reference here - you're wrong!), a hard drinking tough guy who has hit rock bottom.  Gabriel Byrne is 'The Man', an unnamed character who is possessed by the devil to wreak havoc and find the 'Chosen Girl'.  That girl is Christine York (yes, as in Christ) played by Robin Tunney.  She has a birth mark that clearly indicates she will be the devil's main squeeze when Y2K hits.  In a series of action packed events Anrie becomes her protector, keeping her away from the devil, because if she mates with him then that would mark the end of the world. So what is so wrong with this movie?  Well, technically speaking, nothing.  All the elements of a good Arnie movie are here.  The action is non-stop.  The special effects are great.  Of course it's hokey, and naturally the stunts seem impossible and implausible.  And Arnie gets in a few one liners, delivered as only he can.  There is the odd assortment of characters doing unusual and sometimes unbelievable things.  Arnie gets throttled by an elderly woman.  His sidekick (this time around it's Kevin Pollack) helps Arnie with some of the more difficult stunts (like acting).  And Gabriel Byrne has just the right look to play the dastardly devil.  Just like Total Recall or Eraser, End of Days provides a good mix of predictable and not so predictable action. So what was the problem?  Well, maybe it was the timing.  Ten years ago this flick might have been a box office giant.  In today's world, where action movies with hi-tech special effects are a dime-a-dozen, and Arnie movies have become common place, End of Days just doesn't fit in. Mr. Swartzenegger is going to have to tackle a new genre if he is going to survive the next Millenium.  His days as an action hero are definitely on the wane.

While it isn't terrible, it isn't good either.  Perhaps my expectations were too high for this movie, but I couldn't help but be disappointed.First off, I'm not going to complain about the plot holes.  You don't go to a Schwarzenegger movie and expect Citizen Kane.  As long as the action flows along in a more or less logical fashion, I'm happy.  That does not happen here.  All of the action sequences are recycled from other movies that did them ten times better.On the plus side, the special effects are nice to look at.  Gabriel Byrne obviously has fun playing Satan.  Everything looks nice and dark.  Arnold almost saves the movie with his presence.  He's got some nice one-liners, and he gets to do some actual acting.  Unfortunately, most of it is too little too late.End of Days isn't a bad movie.  Arnold fans like myself will still have a decent time, but it doesn't exactly evoke memories of T2 or Predator.

But that's not uncommon these days with big budget blockbuster Hollywood action- movies. The story is too silly to take serious, witch should not be a problem when it is told convincingly, but some turns in the plot are too unlikely. But if you like movies with lots of explosions and shoot-outs with enormous guns, and don't mind about the plausability of the story, you might like it. The movie is a mixture of all kind of other movies, maybe in a homage to those, or maybe just because of lack of inspiration of the writers. The last option is the most likely. I saw references to Terminator 2 and Predator ( both also with Arnie in the leading role), The Usual Suspects, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist III, The Devil's Advocate, Speed, any James Bond movie, The Night Of The Living Dead, and even Monty Python's Flying Circus ( Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!). The film once more shows that Arnie is in fact a very bad actor. He is playing a part that should have been played by Bruce Willis ( on the other hand it's in fact better for Bruce that he's not in this mess...) The only actor that does a good job is Gabriel Byrne, but he's not as good as Pacino in The Devil's Advocate. In the scene where the two main characters meet in Arnie's apartment, Arnie is completely played of the screen by Byrne. Finally what a shame that Arnie will never play a bad guy again, now that he is a big Hollywood star. He was at his best as a mean murdering robot in Terminator 1!

Nevertheless, they don't make bad movies like they used to, they seem to be able to make most movies somewhat redeeming, so it's a real pleasure to see an out-and-out BAD movie that is so very horrid that it just becomes precious, like a sixth-grade play or something. It becomes a little cute because the creators really don't seem to know how terrible it is. And that's sweet.Here are just some general impressionsI think this kind of action movie is dated now. I think The Matrix changed the rules for action movies, and this kind of over-the-top bombast and hulking hero with snappy one-liners really seems SO early 80's. There were times when I thought this movie might get a little creepy, but every time it starts to accumulate some atmosphere it is shattered by a huge explosion or one of Arnold's stunts or something else that returns the film to it's VERY general-audience level of banality. This is VERY MUCH an Arnold film. It also feels very dated like one.I know Arnold was trying to act, but I think he should either give it up or do different movies altogether. One thing he can never get past is HE'S ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. He can't assume roles like other actors can, unless that role is of an Austrian Bodybuilder. It's funny in this movie because at one point he's supposed to have fallen into squalor, living on pizza and beer and Chinese takeout--and yet he has this incredible body! Also, his version of acting in this movie is to raise his eyebrows in a Crazy...or is he? kind of grimace, which won't quite work through a whole movie. It was quite precious to watch, though.This film was SO OBVIOUSLY filmed in Toronto or somewhere else. Now that I live in NYC you can just look at a corner, and even if you don't know where it is, you know it just doesn't have that New York look. Here they show a cut of Times Square or the Chrysler Building and then cut to Toronto. It's funny. They also throw these VERY cheap-looking NY2K posters EVERYWHERE (so much that I thought they might at one point have to do with the story)... but the posters are too cheap-looking to be real. Nothing that cheap-looking would ever be put up in NYC. The second part to this is the INCREDIBLY fake-looking subway. My favorite is the little signs that say Penn Station and Times Square... as if from that we must really know we're in New York! They're just picking places tourists would recognize and say Oh yeah, New York! Why not say Statue of Liberty or Empire State Building? The subway cars were also extra dirty, to conform to stereotypes of what NYC is like. It's not like that the subway is very clean and safe now, but we do have to keep up stereotypes of what the city is like, don't we? Also, there's no enormous church just off Times Square, but I'm splitting hairs. The effect is very comical.The dialogue is just SO SO bad, but it was so bad that I can't even remember some of the worst lines. I'm not talking about the one-liners... you expect top howl at those, I mean just the all-the-way-through dialogue. Wow. Bad.Anyway, all round quite ridiculous, but good fun if you expect it to be bad from the start, My hand was over my mouth in a mixture of horror/laughs through almost the whole movie.

I understand this movie is Sci-Fi, but it is totally bogus. The acting is terrible. Kevin Pollack looks like he can't wait for the scene to be over. Gabriel Bryne gives a decent evil performance, but fails in other areas due to a bad script. Robin Tunney (with short hair) is a lovely little lass, but even after she knows what's about to happen to her, she still looks confused. Why didn't they just jump on a plane and head East? The only thing that can save Arnold now is a new Terminator movie. T3 is suppose to be in the works along with True Lies 2. Jamie Lee Curtis is suppose to reprise her role. Both of these movies could be BIG for Arnold, but he must stay away from these bad scripts. Jean Claude Van Damme should have did this movie. It's more his style.

True Lies and Terminator 2 were awesome but those were the only two films of his that have lived up to his previous films of the 80s (Eraser wasn't bad, but not groundbreaking).  We all love to see him in films like Terminator and Predator where everything was just so fun and enjoyable to watch.  End of Days however, although full of some pretty good action sequences, seems to be lacking.I don't know where to really point my finger exactly.  The ending pretty much ruined the film for me, that's for sure.  And throughout the film I found myself checking my watch, itching me head, just trying to get comfortable and wondering if it's going to get any better.  Some parts did surprise me and I did jump up a little bit during a scene or two.  The lunatic with the strange blonde hair was really freaky but he was really only used for a scene or two.  Had this been the work of James Cameron however, this would have been an excellent film.The acting isn't to bad.  Arnold is what Arnold does best, a hero who you just want to see go out in action and save the day.  The loss of his characters wife and son gave him something to work with and he delivered the character nicely.  Gabrial Byrne was descent, but like everyone else said, I just kept feeling Al Pacino's performance in The Devil's Advocate leaking through.  Of course they do look rather similar and it's obviously rather hard, make that rather impossible, to be a better Satan than Al Pacino.  Kevin Polluk does his usual and was an okay comic relief but for a film like this you gotta stay tense the whole way through, not giving up till the finale.End of Days wasn't exactly a bad film.  There are some good scenes throughout it but that's all you really remember when you walk out of the theater.  And good scenes don't always make a good movie, you shouldn't walk out of a film saying that one part was so cool... you should be saying that film was so cool.  Chances of me seeing it again are rather rare and chances of me recommending it to others is also probubly not going to happen.  I really hope Arnold's next film is solid, and it's a shame that he won't be around for the next Terminator films.  Lets just hope he can deliver in the future.

Can't one of the highest paid stars in the world find a script that isn't a re-hash of every action movie of the past twenty years?Some examples 1) Arnie as the burnt-out cop. You can tell this because he holds a gun to his head in the opening scene and drinks beer and pizza shakes for breakfast. Never mind the fact that he delivers the rest of his lines with an annoying what-me-worry attitude that never suggests that he's on the verge of suicide.2) Kevin Pollack as the wise-cracking sidekick. Every action hero has to have a pint-sized, ever-smirking partner to provide comic relief. Too bad he doesn't provide any here.3) The rules only apply when its convenient. Guns don't hurt the devil...unless there's no other way to end the scene. Somehow, I don't think the devil would have so much trouble fighting one guy with a machine gun.4) Don't kill the good guy when you've got him trapped. Let him live so he can be a further pain in the ass.There's much more than this that's wrong with the film. The action scenes are edited in confuso-vision - I assume to create a sense of chaos or something. But here it just make the action unclear and unsatisfying.Why Peter Hyams was chosen to direct is beyond me. The guy's OK - nobody expected much from TimeCop or The Relic- but choosing him to helm a big-budget action movie with an A-List action star is a questionable decision to say the least.

It's also badly edited.Gabriel Byrnes' Satan character is very much flawed here not because of his acting (actually he's great here) but because his character is as badly written as the entire plot. Basically, Byrnes' acting was just not utilized well-enough, hence, wasted.Though, the action was great (and a lot even for this type of film) it sort of slowed down unexpectedly at the last moment making the conclusion anti-climactic. And this is also due to Arnold's dramatic moment required at the end scene that will show his acting prowess.

Despite some well-staged action scenes and a respectable performance from the always-dependable Arnold Schwarzenegger, this film is largely a hodgepodge of elements from other films, most of them not utilized with any particular flair or imagination.It is interesting to see Schwarzenegger playing a broken-down, depressed figure instead of his usual Teflon hard-ass.  Still, this character is underdeveloped and let down by a script that serves up a busy but still poorly thought out plot about the devil attempting to impregnate a chosen woman on New Year's Eve 1999, thus bringing about the end of all creation.After the complex and intriguingly presented theology of Dogma, it was sad to see a film with such hoary and ill-reasoned theological concepts driving its narrative.  The devil's powers seem to differ from scene to scene, but Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of said evil beast is not bad, considering I saw Al Pacino do most of it a few years ago in The Devil's Advocate.This film, which has nothing truly original in its plot and not one memorable line of dialogue, is a major letdown considering that the screenwriter, Andrew W. Marlowe, also gave us Air Force One, a film with a committed, intelligent script that elevated its rather rote material.  Peter Hyams, however, is a man from whom I've come to expect nothing less than the least.  He does give us some big-money action payoffs here, to be sure, but his editing often renders even the quieter dialogue scenes too fast for the eye to keep up.  He makes Alex Proyas look like Ozu.Kevin Pollak and Rod Steiger do nothing to particularly distinguish themselves.  Robin Tunney makes her damsel a little too distressed for my tastes, but to be fair, the real fault with her performance falls to her hairdresser.  With that wild Beethovenesque frizz Tunney's sporting here, she looks terrified even before Satan shows up.  Forget the guns, and get yourself a comb.

Thus, after 1000 years, we're on 1001, or 2001 and the millennium starts, not on January first 2000 but January first 2001. I say this because the mistake was made in the movie. Now, the real thing.The movie was really cool and entertaining. I thought that it would be an atypical Shwartzennegger (or whatever he spells it) movie, with a few heavy action scene and the rest of the movie a theological thriller or something. Man was I wrong! The action is very near from non-stop, and what's more, its really good, altough there are maybe too much explosions in my taste. The direction and special effects are excellent (after seeing Satan in his true form, I can't wait to see the Balrog in Lord of the Rings!)On the other side, the story sucked alot. First, the inversed number of the beast sounds more like an excuse to set the movie on the edge of the millennium. Also SPOILERS HERE DO NOT GO FURTHER UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE (or really don't care), it is said at one point in the movie that Satan can only copulate with Christine because she was born at a time X, and that he could only possess Gabriel Byrne body, for the same reason. But he ends up possessing Arnold (its easier to spell this)! And the suicide of Arnold, altough it is very typical of movies featuring demons (like Fallen Angel or the devil's advocate) was far from necessary five more second controlling himself and Satan would have lost and depart for another millennium.

Not even the special effects kept me interested. I loved the Terminator movies I even liked Kindergarden Cop and twins but his portrail of some ex-cop in this movie leaved so much to be desired.

The bad technique and dissatisfying effects (considering what the budget must have been) were enough to want my $8.25 back.  However, all these have been heavily commented on.  I would like to remark on how the movie failed miserably on a biblical and theological level.Now, I have nothing against Roman Catholics, but why is it that the truth in movies is always found in the dimly lit basement of some spiritually enlightening Catholic church?Strange that the movie claims a Christian base and yet misses the entire theme of Christianity.  Yes, you must have faith in Christianity.  But according to End of Days in a horrible situation where God doesn't save us, we have to save ourselves.  Yet we must have faith because the bible says so.  Why do we need to have faith in God when we apparently don't need Him and we essentially just save ourselves (even though we need to ask God for strength to defeat Satan)?  Strange theology.  And certainly not Christian. The Bible says have faith certainly, but if you really want to go by the Bible, we don't save ourselves.Then the issue of Revelation 207 (When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison).  The writers of this one have seemingly taken this verse and the last sentence in Revelation 1318 (The beast's number is 666.) completely out of context and used them to create their entire plot--one which would appeal to the end of the millennium.  When the number of the beast (whom they imply is Satan and not the antichrist) is flipped upside down it is 999.  The numbers 999 represent the thousand years.  So the thousand years is over, for the second time (the first time was 999 BCE), and Satan gets his second chance in 1999 (only between the hours of 11pm-midnight, which isn't anywhere to be found in the Book of Revelation).  This interesting considering Revelation was written in Koine Greek, which doesn't have the same numbering system as ours, and would not create the number 999 when flipped upside down.  But that's okay, because some Gregorian monks created our system, and they knew what John REALLY meant.  Even though when developing the BC/AD system they messed up considering Jesus was born at least 4 years before they thought.  So, was Satan released according to the actual timeline or the faulty Gregorian one? Is it a thousand years after Christ's birth or when the monks thought Christ's birth was.  Maybe the priests on their computers in a dimly lit church basement can tell us.It was a bad movie with a bad plot, bad script, bad acting (except for Byrne) and a heavy misrepresentation of Christianity.  I don't know who came up with it, but as far as I know this belief does not fall under any conventional Christian view.  And if it did, it would be one of extremely bad biblical hermeneutics.So, if you go to see it, don't expect to be impressed, and certainly don't take it seriously.

I put it down there with the Last Action Hero in the category of trying to do something beyond a straightforward action film, but without having the courage to marry that enviable goal with a decent plot, a logical story-flow or credible acting.When you watch an action film, there is a certain immediate suspension of disbelief - the kind that lets the viewer accept the absurd A-Team-style action sequences of an earlier Arnold film like Commando.  But when you see a dramatic film - even a dramatic-action film, the picture needs to make sense.  You know, those little things like plot, motivation, character development etc...End of Days ultimately fails because it doesn't make sense.  It also fails because it doesn't play to Arnold's considerable strengths as a performer. Without giving too much away, I was constantly asking myself questions like, Why does Satan need a bodyguard?  Why is Rod Steiger still alive after Satan has killed everyone else in the church? Why are they crucifying Arnold instead of killing him?Keep in mind, I'm not questioning the obvious action sequences, or why Arnold's boss let's him gear-up a la Commando for the final showdown with Satan, without even asking why this drunken, deadbeat, ex-cop who hasn't reported in for a couple of days needs a rocket launcher. That's par for the course.In the end, End of Days would have been much better if it had aimed lower and been a straight-ahead action film with lots of Arnold screen time, a few new corny Arnoldisms (I'll be back etc.), more action scenes, fewer digital effects and some decent second-string villains for Arnold to vanquish.Alternatively, it could have been a really interesting film if it had tried to build on the dramatic tension the film tries to create in sequences like the long discussion between Satan and Arnold.  But alas, that would have required a decent story.

Unlike many, I loved much of his early work, including Commando, Running Man, even Raw Deal.  His documentary, Pumping Iron, was excellent as well.  Total Recall, the Terminator series, even Red Heat - all I enjoyed despite his acting abilities.  These movies were simply entertaining; they are not meant to evoke some cathartic experience. However, as his salary ballooned and his focus shifted away from traditional action, the quality of his work deteriorated.  Examples Jingle All the Way, Junior, Last Action Hero (an insult to Arnold fans everywhere), and Batman and Robin.  However, End of Days does somewhat repair the damage.End of Days does provide a worthy action vehicle for Arnold's talents.  He speaks some great one-liners and has some good action scenes. Unfortunately, the script is poorly written (shocking given the staggering budget of this flick).  Commando is the tightest, most logical script on par with Gone with the Wind compared to this script.  First, Andrew Marlowe, the scriptwriter, does absolutely no character development whatsoever.  Not that it is expected from an Arnold movie, but it is nice to know who the hell the character is.  If I hadn't read the reviews ahead of time, I would have had a difficult time determining that he was even a security guard for Gabriel Byrne.  The action just starts, no explanation.  Then, periodically, we have some ridiculous plot points drawn.  I think Marlowe spent a weekend searching through his Gideon bible from a hotel room trying to figure out how to make his storyline make sense.  For example, the 666 meaning 999 and then, just add a 1.  Figuring out that Christ in New York means Christine York and that there is only one Christine York in a city of over 9 million people.  Please...  Then, you get Arnold just making dumb decisions , which is usually out of character for the action star.  For example, when Arnold disconnects the subway cars during an action scene, he does so from the wrong subway car and then, jumps to the disconnected car with Christine York.  Why didn't Arnold simply disconnect the subway car from the other side, the side with Christine York in it in the first place?  Things just don't make sense.  Finally, the ending is not very good.  Predictable and been done  before.Despite these criticisms, this movie does entertain.  Without Arnold, it would be sitting on a shelf next to Mars Attacks.  However, Arnold makes this movie.

Jericho Crane (Arnold) is an ex-cop who is hired to guard a wall street big wig, The Man (Gabriel Byrne), who has been taken over by Satan (yes, the devil himself). What Jericho doesn't know is his client's alter ego plans to impregnate a young woman (Robin Tunney) with his child within one hour of the new millenium.

I have read many mixed reviews on this film and allow me to set the record straight.  Three types should see this film horror fans, action fans, and Arnie fans.  End of Days successfully combines the horror and action genre for one hell of a thrill ride. Arnold plays an ex-NYPD cop now private security agent (along with partner Kevin Pollack providing good comic relief) who comes to the aid of a young woman marked for consummation by Satan (thus ending mankind as we know it).  Two schools of thought exist to foil Satan (Gabriel Byrne), one group (knights of the sacred heart I believe they call themselves) wants to kill Satan's unwilling bride-to-be while the other relies on the more traditional aspect of faith in God (both stemming from the very same Vatican!) In a radical departure from his traditional action roles, Arnie plays flawed hero Jericho Cane, a drunkard down on his luck and without faith (lost both his wife and daughter).  It is definitely an interesting character study as Cane must not only grapple with personal issues but the greatest manifestation of evil the human mind can acknowledge.  Byrne, on the other hand,  plays the devil with charisma and intelligence.  Although many may be disappointed with his initial entrance, one cannot deny his screen presence.   Many critics have complained the film lacks originality.  End of Days indeed does borrow visuals and concepts from the Omen/Exorcist I and III as well as from numerous Schwarzenegger flicks ranging from Terminator to Predator.  The brilliant opening sequence also reminded me of THE MATRIX.  However the combination of religious horror with the bravado of a Schwarzeneggar persona is ultimately the films greatest triumph.    Peter Hyams (THE RELIC, TIMECOP, THE STAR CHAMBER) provides enough eye candy for any genre fan (e.g. the most wicked inbred since DELIVERANCE, stigmata, crucifixions, Arnie double fisted, the most firepower since Terminator II).  Finally, the film does successfully manipulate emotions to the point where I could honestly say I care if Evil wins over Good.

And leave your cell phones home too; I think we are all tired of some idiot answering a cell phone during a movie! Rod Steiger plays the priest who not only has to try to find and protect the girl, he has to try to stop other Catholics - including the cardinal of New York - from killing the girl to prevent the copulation with the Devil.At the heart of the film is how Satan can NOT be stopped by the entire Church, but can possibly be stopped by the faith, goodness, and sacrifice of one man whose transformation away from violence must happen.

It's an old but applicable theme.One of the more curious elements of the movie is how impotent the Catholic Church is against Satan crucifixes, churches, priests, and even one cardinal can do nothing against The Prince of Darkness. Incidentally, unlike some movies and art exhibits of note which ARE Catholic-bashing, I do NOT find that to be the case here, although it came close with the cardinal intent on murder.   Some of the scenes are memorable, such as the Satanic ceremonies deep under the street of Manhattan, and the fight on the subway train which was spectacular. Many of the shots in Manhattan are well worth seeing.Elements of Day of the Locust, The Omega Man, Rosemary's Baby, and The Exorcist all can be recognized in this film. But even if End of Days is derivative to a degree it still works.

Marlowe but I don't believe it. It was written by a Magic 8 Ball and occasionally a heuristic computer was called in for a consult. Don't try to kid the kid.As the new millennium approaches (Kids That would be the year 2000.) the Devil must appear and impregnate a mother-designate before New Year's Eve so she will give birth to the Devil's spawn, who will then rule the world. The Catholic church apparently has a handle on these plans. In fact, one perverse but well-meaning sect is out to eliminate the young lady (Robin Tunney) and prevent the design from being realized. The Good Priest, a plump and lumbering Rod Steiger, has nothing but good in his heart but is unable to do anything in the material sense. Schwarzenegger, in his last movie before becoming a real power as well as a health food fanatic, is an ex cop who gradually catches on to the sneaky stuff and does battle with both the militant Catholic sect and the more or less immortal Devil (Gabe Byrne) and his myrmidons.It's a kind of pastiche of horror movies. Let's see. The impregnation and the need for its being prevented is from Rosemary's Baby and The Terminator. The Devil nobody believes in is from The Usual Suspects. Steiger does a reprise of his honest but helpless priest from The Amityville Horror. The final earthly representation of Lucifer looks like the monster in the defensive field in Forbidden Planet. The smashing up of the subway cars is reminiscent of the subway crash in the third installment of the Die Hard franchise. The prelude to the climactic confrontation -- in which Arnold buckles on all kinds of black leather straps and holsters and arms himself with enough weapons to destroy a city is from every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie you ever saw.Yet, the Magic 8 Ball must have realized that the series of Schwarzenegger action movies was growing a little long in the tooth. It must have advised, Try Something New. In this flick, Schwarzenegger is no longer Superman, like Steven Seagal, who emerges from heroic battles unscathed. Here, he gets thrown around a lot, banged up, beaten with pipes, slammed against walls. He bleeds. He howls with pain.But the over-achieving 8 Ball went a little too far in suggesting that Arnold be given a chance to act. And not only act, but to act out a crisis of faith in the aisle of an elaborate church with stained-glass windows and a thousand candles. Tears run down his face. He has an epiphany, a Road To Damascus experience, before throwing himself on a sword after being possessed (Cf., The Exorcist). He gave a much better performance as governor.The best lines are given to Gabriel Byrne, with an attempt at a New York City accent. He makes some clever, if not especially fresh, observations on the nature of good and evil, and the character of God. The lines aren't really challenging though, not to people who have given any thought to them, or who think at all.I understand Shwarzenegger is now back, in another action movie. Too bad. He can't possibly need the money.

The posters and the advertising impressed me, and it promised to be a rather thrilling movie. Unfortunately it turns out to be much less so. The effects and the action sequences are literally what one would expect in an Arnie movie. Like Terminator II he is going up against something which simply cannot die, so in the end of the movie the heavy weaponry comes out. Unlike Terminator II, the movie is not constantly on the go and you become somewhat agitated as you have to put up with a rather contrived plot in between the action sequences.The movie is about the end of the world and how Swartzenegger stops it. The precept is that a girl is born who will give birth to the child that will destroy the world. Every thousand years, Satan is released to mate with the girl, and if he succeeds then the world will end. So humanity is responsible for stopping him and giving them another 1000 years to develop until he comes again. Of course this is all stupid, and the way they explain it, such as 666 being upside-down (especially since the Greeks did not use Arabic numbers like we did, and that is what John, the author of revelation, wrote in), was just plain stupid. It would have been just as good if they had left that out.The plot is the typical good verses bad idea. The good guys are the church while the bad guys are the satanists. I liked the whole secret society aspect to the film where there are disparate factions in the church with all of their own goals while the satanists are one huge underground faction bent on following their master's will. Satan is the big bad guy, and I feel that Gabrial Byrne plays him exceptionally well. What is impressive is that Satan is played as his manipulative, deceitful and betraying self. He is actually shown as not the cool person to follow, and that the promises that he makes are inevitably destructive.God, on the otherhand, is misportrayed. He is described as a distant figure who lets humanity fight its own battles. It is the Catholic Church (rife with its traditions and such) that is portrayed as the proper church, not the evangelical, bible believing church. In fact the claim that the end of the world can be predicted is unbiblical as we are told that we will not know the hour or the day. Still, the movie redeems itself slightly at the end when Arnie puts his trust in God by asking him to give him strength, and then goes on to defeat Satan. I guess in the end, Satan is a powerful being not to be trifled with, but God is supremely more powerful.

That bride is Christine York (Tunney), who 20 years earlier on her birthday had been chosen by Satanists to be the one for the spawning of the anti-Christ. Enter retired cop Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), a suicidal security expert whose family were murdered, who after being hired to protect an every day business man finds himself in a battle with evil itself. It's not just the fate of poor Christine that's now in his hands, but that of mankind too.Arnold versus The Devil, you couldn't make it up could you? Well actually they did, but hey, what's wrong with pitting modern cinemas action super star against man's ultimate enemy? The answer is nothing wrong with it at all; as long as the expectation level is set at brain left at the door for some mindless popcorn fun. Which when one sees the premise on offer is all one can surely expect to see. Surely? Budgeted at $100 million by Universal Studios, of which $25 million went on the Austrian Oak's salary, End Of Days, contrary to beliefs, made over double that when all sales were factored in. However, it was still a poor return for such a big block-buster and Universal were most disappointed in the returns. As was Schwarzenegger himself, who was hoping to launch a big movie come back after a run of sub standard movies had seen his stock fall. Throw in the Razzie nominations for Schwarzenegger, Byrne (who was also up for Stigmata) and Hyams, and it doesn't make particularly inspiring reading.It's all very ridiculous, the film not the statistics, but End Of Days is a whole bunch of explosive, bonkers, action based fun. Its flaws are many, not least that the plot is actually an adventurous reworking of T2 Judgement Day (Arnie playing it on safe territory one feels). While giving the big man some character depth was never going to be a good move considering his-ahem-range. Yet the film finds him on particularly good muscular form, machine gunning, shooting rockets and facing off against Byrne's (having a great time and playing it as it should be played) snarly, sarcastic Old Nick adversary. Tunney (wolf whistle that body) bats the eyes and screams as befitting the role, Pollak deserves better but runs with it in his usual dry dulcet way, while the wonderful Miriam Margolyes gets to kick Arnie's butt! Yes it's that kind of movie folks.With dashes of grue and explosions aplenty it was never about trying to win awards. If ever a film does exactly what it says on the tin then this is it.

The script by co-producer Andrew W.

What, may I ask, more do you want? While all the necessary, well as far as I'm concerned they're necessary, ingredients are present & correct there's slightly more substance in the story & character's than one might expect from a big budget Hollywood shoot-'em-up. Again I should stress it's not going to change the way you look at life but I thought the character's were well fleshed out & fairly believable (in context obviously!) while the story itself had a bit more to than I expected with a decent amount going on throughout the film. I also thought the ending was brave, I believe this is the only film in which a character played by Schwarzenegger dies so don't expect the usual sugar coated happy Hollywood ending.Director Hyams does a good job, a lot of the film is pretty dark. The action scenes aren't outstanding or particularly original but their well done & are suitably over-the-top & extravagant. The film seems to have a hard time deciding whether it wants to be a horror or action & as a result it sort of alternates between the two in a seemingly random & uneven way. There is one funny bit though where the old grey-haired & somewhat fat Miriam Margoyles has a fight with Schwarzenegger & beats him up! There's some decent gore here, a cut open snake, an exploded head, plenty of gunshot wounds, someone is crucified using medical equipment, a shard of glass is pushed into someone neck, cut out tongues & someone has their heart ripped out.With a supposed budget of about $83,000,000 End of Days has that Hollywood polish about it & it is very well made with great production design, special effects & cinematography. The acting was OK, Schwarzenegger has never been the best actor in the world but he's OK here, Byrne is class as Satan while Rod Steiger plays a Priest & the infinitely watchable Udo Kier has a small role.End of Days is one of those big budget Hollywood flicks that is loud, noisy & delivers plenty of bang for your money.

With a huge SFX budget spent on pretty cool pyrotechnics and CGI, a loud action hero(Arnie) and the devil himself on a hunt for a one-night stand, End of Days would have been a good movie in the 40's. Of course, back then it would have been banned. End of Days is brutal and non-compromising and refreshingly clich√©-free for an action film.Arnold decides to act and he doesn't fail. Some scenes are borderline funny when they're not supposed to be but still, over-all, it works.

When bad things happen, He works in mysterious ways), but in the end Arnold is redempted when he is forced to choose between the Holy Spirit and his M-16 with a grenade launcher, in what must be one of the weirdest scenes of 1999.

The visions throughout the movie are imaginative, sometimes unsettling and always satisfying. The strong sex scene described in the MPAA rating is pretty much insane. There are strong Arnie movie vibes throughout the movie for some reason, from T1 and T2 to Predator.Maybe the film-makers really believed the world would end 1999.

Gabriel Byrne is good as the devil, perhaps not as frightening as Pacino, but slimy and attractive enough to be effective. The plot revolves around a girl whose birth is believed to bring around the end of days, if Satan can impregnate her, and as the church is not strong enough to protect her, Arnie mistakenly gets drawn in. With the Dark Lord chasing her, as well as priests who believe that her death is the only solution, Arnie whips out the hardware and eventually sacrifices himself for her, and the world. I saw this in the cinema, just before New Year's Eve, which added atmosphere, not because I was stupid enough to believe that the world was going to end, but because I was surrounded by people who weren't sure. The film has a fair amount of jumpy amounts, not as effective on the small screen, and has some dark content for a typical action flick. But, once again, you don't need to think much for this one, just enjoy, but one question arises if Arnie with guns, grenades etc can barley stop Satan, knowing that Satan tries this once every 1000 years, how did they defeat him 1000 years ago? Harsh language? Sticks?

Arnold portrayed this character with emotions that I could identify with, very real, and his acting was quite subtle at some scenes, I was not a fan until I saw this one, then consequently I bought it on DVD.The main problem about this film is its trailer, I don't know if the trailer on DVD was actually the theatrical trailer while it released, but it's very unappealing compared to the substance of this film to say the least.On the contrary, the two MV on DVD are much better edited than the trailer, I am glad Terminator 3 will be released by Warner Bros instead of Universal Studio, at least WB knows better when it comes to promotion. It's a pity that End of Dayswas much superior than it seemed from the trailer.Other complaint is that the DVD reveals too much secret of the special effects making, it's terrific that those stunts were made very believable, and the CGI was great, but is it necessary to exhibit how they were made? It only reduces wonderment next time you see it, personally I would rather not know these technical things, and believe it's all actually happened (e.g. church explosions and train derailment).Other than those two mentioned above, this film is very good, its atmosphere is thrilling, Usually I hate to watch action films, especially overly violent ones. But Arnold 's acting in this film impressed me a lot and kept me captivated throughout the viewing, It's probably that I like to watch a more realistic character than superhuman ones although the latter are cooler.End of Days is my second favorite Schwarzenegger movie, btw he looked very good in this film, not changed a bit since I last saw him in Eraser except that his performance in End of Days is better than Eraser. He didn't look older after these years, he's more than double my age, but that's not the point, the point is he looks really great and charismatic, it's quite amazing.

I'm a big Arnold fan, ever since I saw his old Commando movie, but the star who really shines in this film is Gabriel Byrne. You can tell that he either took the role with a sense of importance or just really enjoyed it and had fun, because he pulls of the Satan role very effectively. It's amazing that this man can play a character as sinister as that and turn around and play a priest in Stigmata, both to such effectiveness. Aside from these two, the rest of the cast is on par. The female lead is good but doesn't present strong starpower, and I don't expect to see her in many more films as a lead. The rest of the cast is supporting and very insignificant to the story, which is ho-hum.Overall, the film is in the middle. Not cream of the crop, but not a stinking pile of dung.

Commando, Raw Deal, and Conan come to mind. But it seems that he's tried to be more serious since his career was mocked by The Last Action Hero.  That movie undermined everything that Arnold has stood for to me for his entire career.  Since then, he has yet to utter the most recognized Arnold phrase I'll Be Back.  His movies are becoming more legit and less campy.  I've always found campy to be a term used by people who enjoy watching sludge, but don't like to call it such. (i.e. horror movies that are funnier than they are scary)  He attempted to continue his standard style with True Lies, but everyone seemed to see through his barrage of smooth-neckbreakings, perfect aim combined with unhittabillity, and stream of comedic lines.  Since then, his movies have gotten further from what typical Arnold fans appreciate, but without normal movie fans taking him seriously.  Therefore, people have decided he's fallen.  He's moved from where he succeeded to more actual acting, even the occasional unfunny comedy.  End Of Days is NOT a typical classic Arnold movie.  This movie is dark, creepy, and GOOD.  This is a good movie. While Arnold has, finally, shown he can actually do some real acting, this movie really wasn't a role for him.  He does a good job in this, but the role didn't really fit him.  I mean, c'mon... a man is drinking himself to death... and he looks like THAT?  I doubt it.  I personally would have chosen maybe Bruce Willis.  That said, I think this is one of the best movies Arnold has done, by true movie standards.  By Arnold movie standards... its not really the same thing.  Considering what else he's done since Terminator 2, this was pretty outstanding.  Junior, Jingle All the Way, and the much-maligned Batman & Robin were all steps in the wrong direction.  This was a good movie that didn't really appeal to anyone because, A its not a real Arnold movie, and B it has Arnold in it; it can't be good.  If you watch this with an open mind, you'll enjoy a typically brilliant performance from the ever-versatile Gabriel Byrne, who played Satan immediately after playing a priest, both impeccably.  If you're a extremely religious person, you'll probably be offended by it, as it says things people don't like to hear about their religion.

Of course, the plot holes become more and more obvious in repeat viewings, but the fun's still there.  This is more serious than Arnold's usual work (which, despite gratuitous action, borders on comedy), but he still manages to squelch out a few funny one-liners.  And best of all, he's paired off with the hilarious comedian Kevin Pollak.  So whenever we don't have Arnold to provide us with comic relief, we have Kevin.  Wow, we lucked out!  There's one really funny scene, where Arnold makes a breakfast shake out of everything he finds in his kitchen--including a pizza that fell on the floor--and takes a sip, saying They say breakfast in the most important meal of the day.  He asks Kevin if he wants some and Kevin replies, I'm good.  The two of them make a spectacular team, and I hope to see them paired off again in upcoming movies--even if they have to do one of those tired buddy cop flicks.  Just watching those two on screen is a delight.  And of course, Gabriel Byrne couldn't have played a better Satan.  There is a memorable scene where Arnold comes face-to-face with Satan, who's begging Arnold to sell his soul to him.  He says, He's (referring to God) not going to help you.  He just has a good publicist.  Whenever something good happens, it's his will.  Whenever something bad happens, he works in mysterious ways.  That scene alone is worth the price of a rental.

But it isn't a good movie either.  While we do get to witness some surprising tenderness from Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays a Secret Service-style body guard who has (recently?) lost his wife and daughter, his accent causes his angry dialogue to seem more scripted than genuine.  Still, if that were the worst problem this movie had, I would call it a success.  But the flaws of the movie are much broader.One big problem is the predictability of the plot.  The story, which follows a woman, Christine (the movie is full of semi-symbolic names), chosen to bear Satan's Spawn (shades of Rosemary's Baby) and the attempts of various non-Satanic agencies to prevent that.  And while I understand the motivations of the Christians in preventing this union, Jericho's (Schwarzenegger) reasons for doing so are not so apparent.  He doesn't believe in Satan, and Christine indicates she would probably mate with the incarnate Satan willingly, so he isn't even really preventing a rape.  And while we're on the subject of plot holes, Jericho's rescue of the man whom Satan posseses seems pointless (except as a plot device) since we later learn that Satan can use any person he chooses, not someone pre-chosen, as Christine had been.  But, of course Jericho must save him so he will be in the right place to learn about the plot.  And of course he will continue to be in the right places to stop the bad guys just in the nick of time.  And of course every time he turns a corner there will be a horde of zombies.  Etc.The biggest problem, however, is the directing.  Predictability can be overcome with clever directing.  But a close-up of a sliced apple practically screams, Hey, something's going to happen with this, ruining any potential suspense.  The action scenes are also presented in a very straightforward way, keeping us constantly a step ahead of and, thus, slightly distanced from the intensity of the moment.All in all, End of Days is passable entertainment, a typical apocalyptic thriller, easily forgotten over a relatively short period of time.  There are no major theological observations or ground-breaking theories.  The movie tries for nothing more than simple entertainment value, and in that attempt alone it fails.  Just not by much.

As a film it ain't so special, just one of the many millennium-movies, but as an Arnie-film it was a very affirmative surprise to me and to many other too, I suspect. I had no idea he had the courage and guts to do a film like this nowadays!After action comedies True lies and Eraser I thought that this was his current course action here and there, bit of comedy and sentimentalism now and then and some more action. End of days offers direct action and bleak horror - that's it. What surprised me most was the lack of humorous one-liners! End of days is Schwarzenegger's darkest film since The Terminator and that's a noteworthy achievement.

Bad reviews and hype sure has a way of influencing our judgement. I guess this is why I rather enjoyed End of Days on video, since I wasn't expecting much more than Arnold kicking some Satanic butt.End of Days did impress me with its dark and ominous atmosphere. The mood was decidedly creepy and on occasion gets rather disturbing. Hyams conjures up some pretty evil and demented scenes, although not as disturbing if you've seen the recent pictures with similar undertones. The action is orchestrated with style and vigor, especially the whole subway-bit and the scene with Arnold dangling from a police helicopter. Byrne's performance as Ole Nick himself is very understated, but one gaze conveys as much evil as Pacino did with a whole monologue. Who said less is more? Kudos to Stan The Man Winston for the icky demon at the end, although it could have done with some more screen time.End of Days does however suffer because of the premise of merging action with heavy religious themes. The broody atmosphere suffers when the action kicks in and Arnold starts blasting away with his machine gun. This was kind of distracting and at some times seemed rather ludicrous as well. Also, poor Arnold has to do away with evil all by himself, action-hero style, which somehow conveys the wrong message to me. End of Days is also pretty derivative and the whole Satan takes a bride-premise has been done much better before, even when it was delivered as a comedy aka The Witches of Eastwick (Jack is still to date the best Devil...). But since End of Days is  such a dramatic departure for Arnold, the movie shouldn't be compared to classics like The Omen and The Ninth gate at all. Instead, enjoy it for what it is well-produced escapism. Lots of action, gore and some shivers-up-your-spine imagery. Thanks, Arnold, you did it again!!!

End of Days, Arnold Schwarzenegger's latest action film spectacular, achieves that distinction in a mere few months - truly a record-setting time.  Released in November, 1999, the film, dealing with the apocalyptic events surrounding the dawning of the 3rd millennium, already seems hopelessly foolish just a few months into 2000.  Not that it played much better in the last century.  For, in any and all eras, this film is a washout.  Apparently, having run out of villains for the indomitable Schwarzenegger to go up against, the filmmakers simply went straight to the top - or bottom - and found none other than Satan himself waiting in the wings.  This screwy, laughable tale of the devil and his minions wreaking havoc in pre-New Year's Eve Manhattan runs through all the cliches we have come to expect from all the films (from The Omen movies on down)that have attempted to turn the biblical account of the final days into dubious horror movie entertainment.Not directly inspired by the Book of Revelations, the story puts forth the notion that, at the turn of every millennium, Satan has one opportunity to mate with the preordained woman of his choice in order to overthrow God and destroy the world.  Schwarzenegger, as a former cop driven to alcoholism and suicidal despair by the murders of his wife and daughter, somehow becomes the sole protector of the innocent woman whose fate has become so inextricably entwined with that of the whole human race. The villain of the film - in this case Satan himself - lacks even a modicum of consistency in terms of his supernatural attributes.  He can bend time, eliminate anyone he chooses at will and in the most unlikely fashion; he can raise people from the dead, yet he is unable to locate the whereabouts of this one defenseless, unenlightened young woman.  Time after time she manages to slip through his fingers as he bumbles his way through the subway tunnels and dark city streets of a drizzly Manhattan. By combining two genres, the film simply doubles up its cliches. Thus, in addition to all the action film paraphenalia one expects from such a film - countless explosions, runaway subway cars, improbable helicopter stunts, gruesome deaths and, even the oldest cliche of all, a cat jumping out to startle a gullible and easily fooled audience - we are subjected to the usual array of black masses, psychotic, self-mutilating priests, debased religious imagery and, of course, warring factions of Catholic hierarchy who huddle in the dark recesses of the Vatican and debate the morality of killing the innocent girl chosen to be Satan's bride - all elements invariably associated with stories of this kind.In the sunset of his career as an action hero, who would deny Schwarzenegger his little bit of self-indulgent self-aggrandizement?  But, really, turning him into a Christ figure does seem a trifle much to swallow even for his most devoted fans.  As to his acting, the less, as usual, said about that the better.  But, after his recent appearance in the similarly themed but equally awful Stigmata, perhaps Gabriel Byrne (who plays the part of Satan) should start seeking out his own absolution - or, at the very least, some better movie roles.

I gotta comment on his physical appearance you'll remember they never showed him shirtless, a must for him !! Only the tank-top, but if you looked very closely, you'd have seen bulges at the waistline and very thick there, too. ; plus, very sluggish in his movements. We in Hollywood have known for years that he has become somewhat of a slob in that dept. Not too hard to keep his arms in shape, I guess. ANYWAY, I really liked this movie, and I am not one for countless-excessive gunnery-fights and explosions. However, I thought they went with the movie, so I just enjoyed..... Some reviewers are aware that Arnold has a much larger acting-job - Gov. of California....What really puzzles me is, does the pope always sit in huge rooms like that, with all those lights on ? I wasn't aware of that - maybe it was because they were awaiting for everything to explode and the end of the world. I also am confused about how they planned to protect the girl (Robin Tunnry), with some divisions of The Church planning to kill her. Hmmmmm...Arnold's name in this film is quite suggestive - Jericho for the name of the pagan, walled city the invincible Israeli general Joshua conquered the pagans, and would have the protection of Arch-Angel Michael; and Cane (spell it Cain for the evil son of Adam), because he's really about to commit the ultimate sin, suicide. Yes, in places he DOES seem to have some supernatural protection against Satan (Gabriel Byrne, who played a very suave role), but how would the movie progress without it ? His immediate return to strength and brawn goes-along with that extra-ordinary ability which people use when faced with impossible odds brute-force, lifting autos and impossible weights. Thus, he could come down from his crucifixion and become the brute he was.....some reviewer stated he asked Jesus to give me strength when he actually asked help me.I loved all those rites perpetrated on the baby, but thought the snake was a bit much. I guess it symbolized Satan. A huge gap in the script from babyhood-to-twenty-year-old with the nurse being the jailer - after Mom's death? Still trying to figure-out how other reviewers don't realize that the nurse would have supernatural powers, as an agent of Hell. And, The Vatican must have a huge electric-bill - the pope was still in that same room with all the lights, twenty years later. Oh, well......and, like others, I'm wondering how Satan couldn't see inside the church, but turned-up in it. I liked Steiger's role (Father Kovak) - I think he was very believable. HOWEVER, had I been protecting the girl, I certainly would not have been upstairs... didn't you love all that electronic equipment the church had in the basement?All of this is irrelevant - I loved all the explosions and gun-fights with Satan instantaneously healing, and knew right away that Chicago (Kevin Pollack) was on Satan's side. Indeed, Satan could do all those inexplicable things, because he HAD BEEN God's right-hand man, before he was banished to Hell. Where-in-the-world was that huge room, underground, where all the final rituals took place ?? Under the theater ?I am not one to follow a certain director nor writer, but thought Hyams and Marlowe put together a good, enjoyable tale. The CGIs must have cost a fortune. Still, all this gore will not keep me from recommending this film, nor watching it again tonight, story-seeker than I am.

The set up is deeper than practically everything else he has been a character in. Finding the evil prefix, seeing the signs, the coming End of Days. As the good father Rod Steiger, was absolutely believable as sort of a counseling apocalyptic, informant, with the Catholic church. He was intense and whole-heartedly right there laying it out, giving the warning, that would need much heeding. The casting for that Monsignor was perfect. I also, truly enjoyed A.S.'s performance in this film. What a departure from other characters he has played, in many years, say since the 'Original' Terminator, in 84'. A vast, city a specific evil presence. Stalking, encompassing the two investigators. A heavy menacing power, that is relentless and Hell-bent on destruction, at any price.Finding his way around and sort of being a die hard, stumbling cop/investigator. He is on the case, make no mistake, but his own personal life is Titanic proportions. He is going down if he isn't utterly careful in every step that he takes. He is on the trail tracking evil, and he is just starting to figure out the clues, that are being left behind. The Devil, is on his trail, as much as Jericho is on it's. His partner Bobby, is 'on' and little more stabling I think, but soon trouble has come like waves on a stormy ocean, overtaking. I was really set back by this one, with Schwarzenegger, showing his other acting side, he makes good on this investigation. Gabriel Byrne is excellent again, of course.

Usually an obligatory woman has sex early in the film and then is run down and killed by the monster somewhere in the middle.  Playing Satan on earth, Gabriel Byrne's first dastardly deed is to tongue wrestle and grope a woman in front of her dining companion in the middle of a crowded restaurant.  There's a second of her appearing aroused as Byrne walks off and then the next shot is of the entire restaurant being consumed by a fireball as Satan nonchalantly moves on.  Too bad the rest of the film doesn't go in for that sort of brevity.This is one of those movies that has a lot of exposition, but probably would have been much better without any at all.  End of Days basically does a time-out intermittently so characters can explain to Arnold what the point of the next scene is or who so-and-so was.  And the explanations make the plots of 70s/80s satanic horror films like The Omen and The Prince of Darkness sound lucid and downright scholarly.  At one point Arnold doubtfully asks if the apocalypse is really scheduled to account for Eastern Standard Time - for a brief second the movie seems to giggle at it's own absurdly inadequate end times scenario, but then earnestly dives right back into explication as meaningless as star trek technobabble.I had a bad feeling when I first saw Se7en that Finch's effective use of urban dark and decay was going to influence a lot of people to make a lot of movies where characters seemed to be stumbling around the in the dark for no reason.

End Of Days looked fantastic and I could not wait to see it.  But that is where my enthusiasm ends and all cynicism begins.  End of Days is one movie that is so short of logic that after the first 20 minutes or so you are laughing and greatly anticipating the next idiotic plot piece to invade your intelligence.  End of Days is pure idiocy and it is not even fun to mask the ineptitude of the script, straight up, this is a terrible movie.Now I am going to attempt to explain very briefly what this movie wants us to believe.  It starts in 1979 where a priest in the Vatican looks outside and sees a comet racing over the moon.  He goes to an old drawing and it too has the comet over the moon.   The Eye of God.  he says to himself and then rushes into a chamber where the Pope is sitting with his religious advisers presumably talking about what they are going to do on New Year's Eve, and tells him that the child will be born tonight.  The Pope tells him he must find the child and protect her.  It seems that once every thousand years that a child will be born and that child will be the one that Satan has chosen to mate with so that he can come to Earth and wreak havoc and that will spell the End of Days ( get it? )  So now we cut to a dark hospital where a woman is giving birth and when the child is born, a nurse brings it down to the basement where some spooky looking people are waiting and one of them kills a rattle snake and puts the blood of the snake in the mouth of the child.  This is obviously the chosen one and by putting snake blood in her mouth that must mean that she is now protected by Satan and she is now Damien from The Omen.  So now we skip 20 years and we meet a buffed up Martin Riggs who is played by Arnold and he is going to kill himself because he obviously misses his wife and kid.  Hockney from The Usual Suspects walks into the room and tells him that they have a long day ahead of them and so killing himself is not very prudent right now ( I think Fenster and MacManus and Verbal and Keaton were sick on this day so they didn't come and join Hockney on this one ).  So we now know that a burned out Arnold is going to be called upon to save the girl.  That's all you need to know because the rest is really just a bad Arnold movie with logic that is so stupid that it defies logic to understand how this script got made. Here are some questions that I have for the writers of the film, and if you have seen this, you'll know exactly what I mean, if you haven't, hopefully it will deter you from doing so.1) If that guy at the beginning wasn't looking out his window and he didn't see the Eye Of God, would no one else have notified the Pope about this miraculous sight?  Was no one else aware of this Eye of God thing?2) If all of Satan's people knew that this girl was going to be born on this day, were there people all over the world in hospitals waiting for the girl to be born?  And that has to be the case because no one knew exactly where the baby was going to be born, so if that is the case then that means that every city in every country in the WORLD, there would have to be one nurse and at least one snake killing guy that would have to be waiting in the basement of every hospital in the world waiting on the off chance that it was their hospital that little Christine would be born in.  That is a pretty big following, say at least, what, 5 million kids are born every day, so that means at least 10 million people in this cult that are very well funded and have a proepnsity for catching snakes.  And you know snakes would not be too happy to lose their lives that day.  And what exactly does the blood do anyway? 3) If this day was so important and this child was so important, don't you think God himself would have taken a greater interest in trying to stop Lucifer from entering Earth therefore negating all that once was?  Somehow I think that he would send something more trustworthy that a drunk ex-cop with large biceps. 4) I have a great many problems with Thomas Aquinas.  First of all his name. No one ever mentions that his name is that of a great man from the past. If a guy named Albert Einstein showed up and was poking around doing things, I think someone may make a joke about it, or Sigmeund Freud, why not Thomas Aquinas.  And next, if this guy was all that the Vatican had going for them , don't you think that he would be a little more funded than he was and that perhaps he would live in a little nicer place than some rat infested-run-down-basement apartment in New York?  This guy was trying to save the world and he has no money?  I don't buy it.  And when Arnold and Lieutenant Wineberg find his place and they are searching for clues, how come there is a cat in the fridge that just happens to jump out at them? Why?  I have seen horror movies before that throw cats into the frame just to scare us, but never have I seen a cat that jumps out of a fridge.  Why would he be there?  How did it get there?  Are cats strong enough to open a fridge tp get in?  Did Thomas put him there to scare Jerico?  Would it not be dead if it was in the fridge?  All very good questions with no real answers. 5) If your best friend was kind enough not to kill you and then you saw him set on fire, do you A) let him burn B) try to put him out C) at least shoot him so that he doesn't feel the pain of burning to death.  I would say the answer to that is maybe B but more probably C since he is a raging inferno. 6) If a down and out ex-cop is offered all that God took away from him, why would he turn it down?  Does he all of a sudden have faith now?  Has God been good to him?  Does Satan not tempt him to have a better life?  Where is the side to him that wants to say no?  I don't buy that either?  I don't think Arnold's character would have said no to Satan. 7) How do you kill Satan?  You can't.  Not with what we have here.  If he is impervious to pain and bullets and can walk through fire, then why is it that a whole bunch of bullets can stop him? 8) If Satan can invade people's bodies then why didn't he invade Arnolds way back at the beginning and find out where the girl is?9) He is Satan, why can't he find her whenever he wants to? 10) What exactly is it that Rod Steiger and all of his people were doing in the basement with all of their computers?  Were they trying to track down where Satan was on the computer, or were they reading reviews on the IMDb or even checking their email.  According to Steiger, there are forces at work here that you can't possibly imagine.  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO scary stuff!!I really could go on and on and on but I'll leave that to Celine Dion. Just saffice it to say that this is one film that has no logic to it and no matter if it is Arnold or not, it is a terrible film.  I liked it when he was Dutch and the Terminator and Matrix and Harry Tasker and all those other cool characters that he played.  But this Jericho is awful and End of Days is even worse.  If you want to have some fun picking apart a film, go see this one.  The ten issues that I touched on were just the tip of the iceberg, I'll bet that someone else could pick out ten other silly points to the movie that I didn't even mention, it is that stupid.End of Days stinks.

They then argue like typical religious nuts who are mentally disturbed, about weather they should murder the baby or not, even knowing they can't find it. Then the Pope declares they will NOT kill the baby. First off why even discuss it if it's clear you can't find the baby? Are you going to go through the name it's given to you in some 2000 years ago, and start secretly murdering every one on the planet with that name? But you believe in God and are peaceful like God is made out to be right?So the baby is born and these weird Satan guys take her from the delivery room and have some snake blood put on her. This also begs the question. if the evil guys were there when the baby was born, why not take her then and raise her to be prepared for her destiny?So then we see some weird cloud come up in New York City, go into a bathroom and suggest itself into Gabriel Bryne. I guess it's Satan. So he goes out and kisses some woman in front of her husband before walking out of the place and having it explode. Guess the director figured we were bored this far in the movie, so they give us this useless action scene to get our attention again.So when we do meet Arnold Schwarzenegger he's a suicidal down on his luck cop, that has mental problems. To show his job, we have a senseless action scene, someone shoots at Gabriel Byrne. Arnold hangs from a helicopter and we sit there a mindless action scene we know nothing about or care about, except for the Y2K, December 31st 1999 posters, papers, everywhere I guess to remind us a million times what this movie is about.So far into the movie, if you're not bored you probably feel something is really wrong and this movie is going to fall apart at any second.The cops find the guy who was shooting the guns and he's some mentally disturbed priest with his tongue cut out. So we meet the grown up baby again, who hallucinates some very strange scene on a bus just so we can hear a 4 letter word over and over, since this film has to be explicit. We learn Arnold's name is Jericho Cane. Well why don't we just name him Moses? At this point it sounds like an angry 13 year old wrote this after bible study one day. So while we have to see Arnold Schwarzenegger crying his eyes out (And for the record, this also shows how easily he cannot act a serious dramatic role) Gabe Bryne, I mean Satan has a weird nasty fantasy that exploits that 4 letter word we had to hear earlier, and to give us something of entertaining to people who are bored out of their mind so far.Then we also get a stupid scene of Satan running into a kid with a shirt that says Satan Rules and in typical Satan fashion, he lets him die by a bus accident. I don't understand what this scene was meant for. Was it suggested that people who listen to Satanic Music should die? Why not just have a kid wearing a shirt of ANY heavy metal band and have them die since the writers of this film have an obvious problem with some group of individuals out there who may listen to dark versions of Heavy Metal.We learn that Christine York is who Arnold is looking for, I mean Christ can you get any worse names than this? This is where the movie starts to officially fall apart. This is the moment when plot hole after plot hole after plot hole after plot hole become so many holes that I can't list them all so I'll make it short.The dialog in this movie is more laughable than anything. You have Arnold's one liners that get all serious and sound stupid like this one.You're a choir boy compared to me! A CHOIR BOY! (Not he's saying this to Satan, I can't imagine a more stupid, rushed line in history of Arnold's terrible one lines)Arnold survives some things that no other regular human being would survive. (Rioters beating him to death, and crucifying him, falling from a window a dozen stories high, some how managing to survive many explosions that would have killed anyone not in the movie) There's a church that Satan cannot see. Arnold don't believe in God and blames him on his problems for no apparent reason. Satan does some out of character stupid silly things. And the list goes on. I can't list them all but you get the flow.The movie tries as hard as they can to build you up to the ending. Yeah we're ready to get it over with! NONE of the characters are very likable. I guess they tried to build up some momentum at the end and fix some plot holes, but it still didn't work. Actually the ending is rather laughable.

It starts like it could be a great movie, I mean, it stars Arnold Swazenegger (?spelling) How could it flop?Well, for one, the leading character's motivation lacks purpose. First, he's about to commit suicide, then that negative angle of his personality is completely scrapped... and the new motivation is often totally unfounded. He doesn't believe in God, yet is ready to believe there might be a connection between what's going on and the Bible! After reading what is refered to as a football score, he immediately gets the connection to a verse in the bible, which he finds straight away, or course? Of course UNLIKELY! There is a bit of excitement while the tongueless priest /assassin is being chased and a hint of the atmosphere in Seven or NBC's 'Profiler' as they go through Tongueless's living quarters... and find his tongue in a jar.Throughout the movie, as expected, Arnold, unfortunately, too often has that unconvincing look of fear on his face. It's like that OVER-USED mouth gaping in most kid films. Actors these days just seem to have that fear face... but it gets tired and unconvincing when you've seen it umpteen times. One can imagine the director Ok, Arnold, now do the scardie face! CUT! That's a wrap. The movie also unashamedly tries to portray Arnold's character as some sort of Chirst figure, crucified (for a bit) downtown by the devil crowd... All this without establishing the character as THAT kind of character.It's seems directors, in increasing numbers, have forgotten that the audience need to have a reason to admire a hero, pity him or sympathyse with him... There is no character building taking place in this movie. - Ok, we get a little pathetic glimpse at him moping and grunting over a music box, but you can't base a whole character around ONE concept... as I said, the characterization is, at best, SHALLOW.Even the sequence of events is poorly built up. With no reason or buildup, alone, the head priest just pops up and saves him off this cross. No-one comes to tell the priest where he has been seen, the priest just conveniently pops up to save him. I felt this was a bit too much. Especially, after seeing Arnold's character dangling, a-la Jesus, and the priest is made to cross himself! - As if Arnold's character has suddenly become some kind of Saint. That's something this movie can't make him... They never do the background, how can they expect us just to swallow a half baked potato!In this movie they never really establish any real motivation, just portray a chain of events. I felt myself saying WHY!!! when suddenly Arnold's character starts reading the wall of an obviously insane priest... and even less plausable, starts looking for a girl who's picture he finds in a jar in the priest's fridge. COME ON! - Why would he! What about his JOB? He gets ONE assignment in the start of the film, then what? Is he unemployed again? Who is paying for his time to research WHY the priest tried to shoot a Wall Street Banker? Who asked him to? This is an example of how a lot of little missing pieces render this film irritatingly boring to thinking people. I expect then, it was probably made for the ignorant many?Considering the powers they hint that the villain has (the devil), that villain makes absolutely NO use of these powers! At one point he's bending reality, at another point he's just walking in a threatening way! Why not bend reality WHILE walking in a threatening way! and just capture the girl he's after! It's rediculous... About as rediculous as the GIANT devil in the movie Spawn, close enough to crush Spawn but saying to his army of little guys Get him! instead of just crushing him, himself! Duh! If it was just one time, fair enough, maybe the villain is as stupid as the director thinks the audience is, but one gets the feeling they purposely make him fail just to drag the movie on... and on.About as rediculous is, when Arnold's character has witnessed what little damage normal weapons do to this villain... he still has that scene where he goes down to the place he is supposed to work (but this is never established in the film) and arms himself with all sorts of weapons and ammo (complete with the typical military background music, and he doesn't have to answer to anyone about it! Convenient & rediculous!) exploding bullets, rockets, handguns, pump action bazooka, more ammo, more weapons, etc. Who are these for? Killing off innocent civilians who can't help themselves but follow a more powerful person? - Is this our hero? - Who's out to kick ass cos his ass got kicked? Is this what they think a Jesus type hero would do? - in the middle of a religious-type of movie, and after establishing this villain is WAY beyond being blown up, this scene was VERY out of place.For me, the whole movie was like this. Shallow, considering the subject matter (and $ wasted!!!), predictable plot, with no unforseeable twists, obvious and pathetic attempts at symbolism which was very out of place in this movie. Shallow characters with NO credible motivation to take on what they did. A powerful villain rendered impotent at convenient times... This movie had so much potential... but was probably hampered by executives? - It leaves one asking How come movies aren't DEEP anymore? How come millions of dollars are being wasted on crap like this? Have the directors of movies today ever seen any GOOD movies and examined what makes them GOOD movies? I propose lots of trips to film schools. Quite frankly, with the amount of experience of the people involved with this movie, I expected a better film.

Cynicism reared it's ugly head as the only questions being put to Arnold seemed to be of the tell us about your new movie variety. When the star at one point condemned the spread of guns in American society, I posed the question of how he could object to the use of firearms when his entire career appears to be based on their application?Not surprisingly, the company hosting the chat session didn't forward my question as one of those Mr. Schwarz had to answer, but the issue does get raised in End of Days, with a final forty minutes given over to pyrotechnics and not terribly convincing CGI. It's a shame the picture ends this way, as before the final quarter it was actually quite a decent film. This an Arnold who realises his place in the movie business is more in doubt than at any time before, with action movies scarcely existing and his previous film role &#150; snigger behind your hand, he's a big guy &#150; Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. Perhaps inspired by his colleague Sylvester going all thespian in the admirable Copland, Arnold tries his hand at acting. You read that correctly. Here we have an Arnold who loses his first screen fight against a middle-aged woman, a drunken, pill-popping Arnie who has bad hygiene and cries. Yes, cries. Well, a bit. And, to his credit, he shares screen space with Gabriel Byrne, Rod Steiger and CCH Pounder yet doesn't make a complete idiot of himself. He's no Olivier and that accent's as thick as ever, but he doesn't do too badly does our Arnie.The film itself owes more than passing debts to Se7en, while there's a nice line from Steiger's Father Kovak Satan's greatest trick was convincing man he didn't exist. This is, of course, a close paraphrasing of the line in The Usual Suspects, where the subject under discussion was again Gabriel Byrne. Byrne is the Devil, an evil deity with flammable urine (actually another Usual Suspects reference now I think of it) in a largely monochrome-tinted view of pre-millennium tension. Latin and old Biblical texts paint the screen, and there's a very real sense that all are giving their best, if nothing else. Kevin Pollak plays the typical expository buddy role, but other than that the film is relatively free of genre clich√©s. Arnie's wife and child were killed some unspecified years previously, making him flawed and negating tiresome love interest fixations.It is all nonsense of course, Byrne out to impregnate Robin Tunney as the not-that-subtly-named Christine. It appears the Devil can take over the Earth and plunge all into damnation if he has a quickie on New Year's Eve. As this film had a December '99 release, it's the strangest example of a movie with a built-in sell-by date. Maybe the watch it in three weeks or it suddenly becomes irrelevant hook was designed to drag in a disinterested audience. The idea that the Devil can, if not be stopped, but temporarily set back, by Arnie's requisite 9mm is silly, and what begins as a reasonably sombre detective case (even though you'll put all the pieces together far faster than Arnie does) hopelessly degenerates into brain-off firepower. There's also some notably poor and confused editing for the fight sequences. However, it's really not as bad as some reviews have claimed, and worth a look when it comes on TV. The ultimate thought that End of Days leaves you with, though, is that while the world at one point loved Arnie, looking back we were paying to see inconsequential pap like this, The Terminator notwithstanding. End of Days is not a bad Schwarzenegger film (it certainly beats Commando hands down), but we're now watching it with the rose-tinted spectacles long since broken.

I prefer this film over Schwarzenegger new films Sabotage, Maggie and Terminator Genysis also those films are utter garbage of this days. Schwarzenegger can not make any good film this days, like he did by this one. I love this film to death. On millennium's eve 28th December a man must fight against the devil to prevent the end of the world and apocalypse on the New Year's Eve! Honestly? I think it is Schwarzenegger different action film than his classic action films were.The film's plot follows former New York Police Department detective Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), after saving a banker (Byrne) from an assassin, finds himself embroiled into a religious conflict, and must protect an innocent young woman (Tunney), who is unwittingly chosen by evil forces to conceive the Antichrist with Satan.This film isn't classic action movie like are Terminator 1 and 2, Predator, The Running Man, Total Recall and Commando. But it is still a good action film that I love and I will still watch it. This is the first Supernatural film with Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a great movie.. even has some funny parts.. but Gabriel Byrne steals the show as 'The Man' .. a.k.a. The Devil. He is amazingly hot in this movie and actually had me rooting for the devil. I know I wouldn't run from him!!! All hell breaks loose when Arnold Schwarzenegger battles the ultimate evil in this chilling supernatural action thriller. When a burned-out former New York City cop named Jericho (Schwarzenegger) is assigned to security detail for a mysterious and foreboding stranger (Gabriel Byrne), Jericho thwarts an incredible assassination attempt. During the ensuing investigation, he and his partner (Kevin Pollak) save the life of the beautiful and terrified Christine York (Robin Tunney), whose destiny involves death, the devil and the fate of mankind. Now it's up to Jericho to save the girl, the world and his own soul as he comes face to face with his most powerful enemy ever! The movie pits Arnold Schwarzenegger against the devil (Gabriel Byrne), with director Peter Hyams delivering tense moments of action amid not-so-subtle choices for character development.There are forces here you couldn't possibly comprehend. Dialogue from End of Days'' You can say that again. End of Days'' opens with a priest gazing out his window at the Vatican City and seeing a comet arching above the moon like an eyebrow. He races to an old wooden box, snatches up a silver canister, pulls out an ancient scroll, unrolls it and sees--yes! A drawing of a comet arching above the moon like an eyebrow! For verily this is the dreaded celestial display known as the Eye of God.'' The priest bursts into an inner chamber of the Vatican, where the pope sits surrounded by advisers. The child will be born today!'' he gasps. Then we cut to New York City, 1979'' and a live childbirth scene, including, of course, the obligatory command, push!'' A baby girl is born, and a nurse takes the infant in its swaddling clothes and races to a basement room of the hospital, where the child is anointed with the blood of a freshly killed rattlesnake before being returned to the arms of its mother.Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.Without even realizing it, suicidal skeptic Arnold Schwarzenegger sets out to fight the evil one head-on in End of Days. Throughout the story, he resorts to a plethora of guns and firepower. He just didn't understand that spiritual warfare cannot be fought with guns. Not until the conclusion, when Arnold comes face to face with the knowledge that, without God he is useless, is he able to effectively battle Satan. In this I find redemption in End of Days, and Biblical truth.End of Days is a 1999 supernatural thriller directed by Peter Hyams (The Presidio). Set at the end of the twentieth century, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jericho Cane, a burnt-out private security specialist who finds himself protecting a young woman from a man who may embody the ultimate evil and then bring about the end of the world. The film prominently features several models of the Glock pistol, including one of the earliest appearances in a film of the Glock 34. The film's cast includes Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Robin Tunney, and Rod Steiger. At the end of the century, Satan visits New York in search of a bride. It's up to an ex-cop who now runs an elite security outfit to stop him.10/10 Grade A- Studio Beacon Communications,Universal Pictures Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger, CCH Pounder, and Udo Kier.

On that level it works amazingly, and nostalgically for me, it's one of my favourite Arnie films. It just has such a palpably evil atmosphere, and good old fashioned supernatural adventure to it that's awesome. Arnie plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic, tormented private security expert with a sketchy past. When he and his partner (Kevin Pollak) are tasked with protecting a high profile VIP, an assassination attempt is made, and they start to unravel a dark,possible doomsday plot in the making. The man they are protecting (Gabriel Byrne) happens to be none other than Satan himself, hiding in human form, and trying to track down the one girl (Robin Tunny) that he must copulate with before midnight in order to bring about the end of days upon our world. Oh yeah. Byrne brings a gleeful, carefree, alpha male malice to the role, and is one of my favourite cinematic incarnations of the devil ever. Although it's a pretty implausible, fantasy action headbanger, it has a sense of purpose and duty to its own mythology, and takes it seriously, which helps a lot. Hyams also steps in for DP, and there's some truly awesome shots of New York, from dingy back alley chases to helicopter propelled vistas. Schwarzenegger is surprisingly poignant in the role, only allowing his trademark camp to surface once in a while (you ah ah choiahhboyy compared to me, ah choiahhboyy!! Is my favourite). Tunny diligently plays the female lead with understandable confusion, but also noble grace when the heat gets hot. Miriam Margoyles is a terrifying little goblin as her evil Aunt with ties to the cult who raised her to be Lucifer's bride. Udo Kier, in his few scenes, is chilling as the head of the cult. The film has a chilling vibe that raises it above the level of other smash and grab Arnie action opuses, a vibe that's almost reminiscent of classic John Carpenter. The eerie soundtrack adds to the haunted house fun,me specially when old Satan first appears in NY as a giant invisible beast and meanders around looking for a human host. If you're looking for slimy supernatural fun anchored by a midnite movie style concept and some awesome at atmospheric chills, look no further.

The last time he appeared in a movie before this it was in Batman And Robin, which is an excellent candidate for worst movie of all time. End Of Days is a flawed production, but in my opinion Arnold's best and most interesting project from the worst period of his career(the late 90's/early 00's). The premise of the film is where Arnold is to save the world from Satan, who in the new millennium wants to create Armageddon and Hell on Earth. Sounds good to me. However, End Of Days is not without its problems. I think because Arnold was cast, there is too much action for this action/horror hybrid to work. I do think much of this action is great. However, it is a bit overdone for a film of this type. While Arnold is killing tons of bad guys on the screen, much of the atmosphere and suspense is killed off as well. Which is not good as such components are key elements in making material like this work. Also, the abundance of horrible late 90's CGI hurt this as well. Even though the visual f/x are garbage and the action is so much that it dilutes the supernatural/horror elements, End Of Days still has quite a bit working in its favor as well. After a serious operation, Arnold still is more than capable on delivering the action. He also gave an excellent, character driven performance. He definitely held his own against great dramatic actors Kevin Pollak(his cop partner/best friend) and Gabriel Byrne(the physical embodiment of Satan). Gabriel Byrne gives an Oscar worthy performance as fallen angel Lucifer. His presence and performance is remarkable and he brings a lot of class to a production that relies heavily on action and special f/x. The support cast is very strong also. Although I feel that this could have been done better, End Of Days is still pretty entertaining and you could do much worst for an evening's entertainment.

END OF DAYS, one of his last films, is simply terrible. It is the last day of the previous century, and the Devil assumes human form to hunt for a bride who will bear him a child before midnight and the start of the new millennium (never mind that the new millennium doesn't actually start until the beginning of 2001). Once the child is conceived, the world will end and the Devil will reign supreme. The only thing standing between the Devil and his plan is ex-cop Jericho Kane, an atheist who lost his wife and child some years before. With a name like Jericho Kane, you know not to take this flick too seriously, especially after the Deil's bride-to-be yells it about a hundred times. To make things even sillier, Kane's former partner is named Bobby Chicago. Lots of explosions and fires, and absolutely no sense. It also is hard to follow the action with all the jump cuts and dimly lit scenes. Arnold is Arnold, what can I tell you? Gabriel Byrne plays an ineffective Satan and Kevkn Pollack is the former partner. Robin Tunney plays the bride-to-be, and frankly isn't given nearly enough to do, considering her considerable screen time.

It is sad that they (the directors) wasted the brilliance and wonder for a film that would otherwise be a total masterpiece. Not only did they mess up good film concepts but they also tried to make a worthless image of the higher power; I don't believe that Jesus would ever allow Satin to kill numerous amounts of human beings. If End of Days was going to get any larger rating, it would need to have a person of higher power fighting off evil (like in Constantine). But in a way it doesn't matter to me because the fact that the storyline revolves a newly resurrected Satin is completely disturbing. Although they may not try so much to make you believe this, it is foolish of them to put this kind of garbage on the market, as no one needs to experience the 'chorus of demons' that is sung on the biggest waste of film in history.

A lot of people seem to think it was dumb that Satan didn't just kill Jericho while he had the chance. After all, there were a dozen occasions in the movie where he could have just ripped the guy's head off and had sex with Christine without interference. What those people don't seem to get is that Gabriel Byrne's character was NEVER THE ONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPREGNATE CHRISTINE. It was JERICHO who was destined at birth to be the biological father of the Anti-Christ. That's why Satan hired that particular bodyguard in the first place to get him involved. That's why he didn't possess Jericho earlier in the movie because Jericho wasn't yet ready to serve as a vessel. That's why, as he was leading Christine to the altar in the church to rape her, Satan/Jericho told her Everything is as it should be. Old Scratch needed this guy to be alive and with Christine at the big moment so he could possess him. That seemed like a pretty obvious conclusion before the movie was half over, but I guess not everyone could see it even while it was happening.

Hyams' use of lighting is reminiscent of Kim Manners' techniques in the X-Files, and uses it well to keep the viewers in the 'scary mode'. Arnie delivers a mediocre reluctant hero/ cynical cop performance as Jericho Cane that is about on par with his performance in Kindergarten Cop, but nevertheless, it's still an enjoyable movie. Gabriel Byrne rocks! and it's nice to see Rod Steiger on screen again. Kevin Pollack, Arnie's cop partner, does a fine job but I keep seeing Tom Arnold (True Lies) as his partner instead. On second thought, maybe not. While Tom Arnold delivers the one-liners better than Pollack, he probably couldn't pull off the secondary roll Pollack had to deliver.

Given its budget, the film didn't do very well at the box office, but it's not like Arnie isn't getting any work these days, though the movies he'd go on and make would be a step backward (The Sixth Day, Collateral Damage).  A lot of the hatred pointed at End of Days is understandable; it's a very silly movie.  But then again, Stigmata was arguably just as silly if not more and none of that film was meant to be taken as anything less than serious, so how come that movie has its fans?End of Days is set three days before the millenium, and Arnie stars as Jericho Cane, a for-hire bodyguard who's latest assignment is to protect a businessman (Gabriel Byrne).  Turns out this guy he's working for might be possessed by the devil, interestingly enough.  So Cane discovers he's got to find a woman named Christine York (Robin Tunney) and save her from being impregnated by Satan himself.  As I watched End of Days, I noted the movie's numerous typical Schwarzennegger one-liners.  A lot of them were very funny.  A lot of the plot was funny, too, and it only took me a while to realize the filmmakers intended for the film to play as half-serious.  End of Days knows its premise is silly and learns to have fun with it.  For crying out loud, there's a scene where an old woman almost beats up Schwarwzennegger.  If you don't find that funny, then you obviously haven't seen many Schwarzennegger films.  The movie's plot holes are abundant.  Tunney's character was raised by devil-worshippers, hard to believe they didn't raise her to be one, either.  There are also a few things I'm not getting here.  Apparently, the devil is here just to impregnate her with the anti-christ, and he's got to leave the minute it's year 2000.  Everyone in the film is acting like the world will end exactly once it hits 2000, heck, the devil even has Schwarzennegger bound up on top of a building so he can witness the end of the world, as if though we're to expect the baby to be born in a matter of minutes, for him to age to a fully-grown adult in hours, and then take over the world instantaneously, even with the entire Roman Catholic Church aware of all this.  It just doesn't gel.But I go to a Schwarzennegger movie to watch stuff get blown up and shot up real good, and that happens here.  A lot of the action is fast and thrilling, if not exactly memorable.  There's lots of gore for the horror fans and even a bit of gratuitous nudity tossed in to add to the schlock factor.  It's nice to see director Peter Hyams didn't feel the need to dress this up as an all-important movie with a message, a la Stigmata.  End of Days is an action/horror/comedy, with the emphasis on action and comedy.  It works as both, so take it as such.

So the film starts in 1979 with a comet observed arching over the moon, and the Pope sending representatives to all cities to find the baby to be born soon.The movie then jumps to 1999, the baby is now 20 years old and inhabiting the beautiful body of Robin Tunney. They prove it to us with a scene just after her workout, and she pulls off her shirt walking towards her bath room, and indeed she has no sports bra on! That nudity, plus a few curse words, and lots of violence and images of terror earn this film a solid R rating. Arnold is an ex-cop and gets into the fray. Through clues he figures out what her name is, and eventually, why she is being hunted. Some rogue priests want to kill her, justifying it by saving the rest of the world. While the devil has inhabited someone's body and seeks to capture her for sex between 11PM and midnight on New Year's eve, the only valid time for his rape.Arnold and Robin manage to elude the devil, and the climax (the film, not the sex) takes place in a church, and with prayer and strong will, good (God) prevails. Serious subject, but there were a few humorous scenes that fit. After one especially gruesome scene, Arnold's sidekick says, It's official, I'm not going to sleep anymore, not ever.  Not a great film, but we were entertained for its whole 2 hours. It seems to me its rating on IMDb is a little bit low. I give it a 7 of 10.  The DVD has a very nice picture, even in very dark scenes, and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very nice. Plenty of surround effects, and lots of LFE during explosions. There is also an interesting On location extra.However, one unforgiveable mistake. The script takes great pain to point out that the depicted events occur at the end of the millineum.

I tend to agree with a lot of the points made. Arnie is not at his best here by any means and the plot could have been much better. Having said that, it may sound strange, but I quite liked this.Let me point out first that I have no interest in action movies and I didn't watch this for the action. I found the struggle between good and evil far more interesting than Arnie's predictable attempts at saving humanity.Don't get me wrong, as action flicks go, it's fairly respectable but I really must confess I wanted to see this mainly because Gabriel Byrne plays the devil. And may I just say I wasn't disappointed.For anyone who's familiar with literary images of Satan he is always portrayed as attractive and lecherous. Gabriel Byrne plays both with great aplomb. The devil is far more attractive in this movie than the supposed good guy. (Then again that's probably because Gabriel Byrne is incredibly attractive anyway.) Byrne as Satan is also very fond of women. It seems that sex is all he thinks about. No wonder we hear so much about the sins of the flesh.His interaction with Jerricho Cane (Arnold) is interesting because it deals with the ideas behind where pain and suffering comes from. These are the best moments if you ask me. But then again I do like all that philosophical stuff.This film had a lot letting it down. Arnold for one was not convincing and some of the religious constructs were a little shaky. The only reason anyone should watch this is if they are interested in characterisations of Satan. (On the other hand, you'll find nothing new or unusual here either.) Perhaps, after all, Gabriel Byrne is the only redeeming force here... he does have some great one-liners after all.

Only in a country that claims to be the land of the free when a director's creative choices are butchered without rhyme or reason can a piece of hypocritical tripe like this be made.This film would have us believe that Satanic cultists are everywhere, ready to harm innocent children or make life hell for the good little Christian boys of America.

The answer will make it perfectly clear to you how big a steamer this one is.Arnold is not making any smart career moves lately, either. His latest flick is just another anti-cloning piece of tripe that, like all other anti-cloning pieces of tripe, ignores the fact that cloning has the potential to make things like AIDS, cancer, or transplant organ shortages things of the past. Combined with this obvious attempt to pander to the bible bashers of the USA, it leaves Arnie with a rating of two good films in the last ten years.

Whenever he was cast as a good guy, he would be unbeatable, if not immortal. The prime example of this kind of aura that Mr. Schwarzenegger has established for himself is in the movie Commando (1985). And for most viewers, it is easy to suspend our belief when it comes to that, and come up with various explanations to how he can withstand such bodily strain and continue to push forward. The reason behind this was that Schwarzenegger was fighting ordinary people. But this crosses the line on believability.The story is about the ever popular End of the World prophecy that got nearly everybody cringing on New Year's Eve of 1999, where the devil is predicted on returning to open the gates of hell. Thankfully there's Schwarzenegger, playing a depressed ex-cop, Jericho Cane, who lost his family to some no-name robbers and now plays by his own game. But seriously, Schwarzenegger is going to save the day? How does a human being stop a supernatural force like the devil? That should be impossible! Well apparently not, but I still found the whole concept flawed.Character wise, Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't even give a truly convincing performance. It's obvious that he put on some weight too since his last appearance in Batman & Robin (1997). Plus, most Schwarzenegger films have good one liners, I only laughed at one here. His performance was just dry. Playing the devil is Gabriel Byrne and he's even worse. For the majority of the film, Byrne will just walk around with a smirk on his face blowing up things or killing people. He's not menacing at all. However, there was one good scene between Byrne and Schwarzenegger when the devil tempted Cane into joining him. That was interesting, but the rest was slow dialog. The writer, Andrew W. Marlowe who also wrote the script to Hollow Man (2000) didn't do a good job here.The makeup effects I do favor along the various horror elements that were randomly inserted in the movie. Those were okay, and I say okay because they weren't scary but it was ugly visuals, which makes them horrific. Even special effects master, Stan Winston headed the creature effects, which I was happy to see. However, the effects used even in here were almost barely on screen. I also didn't understand some of the editing in this movie. There was an alley fight scene and some of the shots switched out too often too quickly. That was frustrating to sit through. Lastly, the score John Debney composed wasn't great either. There was a theme, which is fine, but it wasn't memorable. There was also a motif for the devil but honestly that particular tune was more annoying. Every time it played, the audience will know the devil is coming but it's so annoying that audiences will roll their eyes when they hear it, instead of cringing in fear. Also, the tracks that covered the action scenes were too generic, there was nothing that made me sit on the edge of my seat hoping for the best. The music wasn't compelling. This movie works in some places but not many. The people who will enjoy it the most are the Schwarzenegger fans.Schwarzenegger's acting is plain, the action is generic and the music is too formulaic. What makes it worse is that the story is way too unrealistic. There is very little that works here.

That's how deep the script is. There's a lot of running, screaming, explosions, deaths, predictable impersonations, and so on. There's a target girl, like in Terminator. There's an exploitive subplot about a dead wife and child. Church people appear just to get killed. But there's little story behind all the noise and chaos.

His work was nothing but cruel chain of flops  Last Action Hero (1993), Junior (1994), Eraser (1996), Jingle All the Way (1996), Batman & Robin (1997). Then this last one was too hard even for him I suppose, but he continued the tragedy with  End of Days (1999), The 6th Day (2000), and Collateral Damage (2002). Loved some of the above or not, the box office surely hated all of them with passion ! But there was a chance for one last, nearly decent, swan song and I mean  Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (2003). After that it's Governor Arnold for you !Despite anything I went to watch (End of Days) having some high hopes. At least director (Peter Hyams) is one I feel optimistic with. But I didn't buy it. And it didn't amuse me either ! Look at it, it's the Terminator 2 formula again  super chaser (The devil this time) chasing a young innocent victim (who's so worthy to him only) and there is kind of super opposite that helps out the victim along the way (Arnold Schwarzenegger in both cases !).

They were just a bunch of silhouettes and subconsciously that says to me that you really will never know who's a true devil worshiper.Out of all places, Satan choose to bust out a fault pipe in NYC for some prophetic coochie, or rather the stars which were aligned for such events to take place.Gabriel Bryne was an excellent devil and so was the Governator's role as 'Jericho', the half suicidal cop who marinates himself at night with hardcore boozing.There are always three things that always annoys me with these types of movies and that is1. Why is it, that the Catholic church (one of the most corrupt organizations or religious institutes) has to be the all knowing authority on demons and devils? 2. Do you ever notice that Hollywood always try to add more sinister-ism to devils, demons and other infernals by making them so horrible and powerful, that their victims have no will of their own? Case in point Gabriel Brynes character has no choice to be the vessel for the devil because the alignment of the stars makes this so.and 3. despite annoyance #2. the good guys always win, and purity prevails although some possessed person has to die through it.But if you take out those 3 things, you have a good movie.One of my favorite scenes is when one of the priest flings forth a big silver crucifix telling the devil to get back before the devil takes the cross and jams it through his skull.One of things that are left for me to chew on is since (in this movie) every thousand years the devil gets to leave his hell to do nasty with some virgin maiden, that means 1999 wasn't his first time, nor will it be the last, and I don't know about you but if I'm locked up for a thousand years looking forward to only one day of freedom, then please believe I would have a full proof plan in succeeding my goal.In summary, with the dark overtones and the relevant filth and corruption of humanity, it would of been more climatic if the devil did get to impregnate the girl.

I'm sure that Arnold Schwarzenegger will continue to pump out a few more crappy action movies in the next couple of years (`The Sixth Day', and God forbid, `Terminator 3'), but his heyday is over.  `End of Days'  certainly doesn't demonstrate anything innovative -- or for that matter, good -- to indicate even a slight hope of positive things yet to come.`End of Days' is about the quest of a man named Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), who's seeking to stop the Devil (Gabriel Byrne) from impregnating his unwitting, chosen mortal bride (Robin Tunney) and creating Armageddon, or the End of Days.  When it comes right down to the nitty gritty, the story isn't any more complicated than that.  Unfortunately, weird explanations involving the Church, sects of Vatican Knights, prophecies, and other jumbled up pieces of nonsense keep getting injected into the story to foul things up.  Add that to many never-satisfactorily explained plot holes (if Arnold's part of a privately owned security agency, and not a government agency, how come he's allowed to wield so much firepower without anybody batting an eye?), and the story's nothing but an incoherent mess.  It actually would've been better if `End of Days' had pared down its moronic story and jacked up the action and violence -- at least there'd be a lot less nonsense to explain.  The movie almost comes across as though some executive had an idea for a movie  Arnold versus the Devil . . . and then used some Mad-Libs style mechanism to create the necessary script for shooting the film.  The action's okay, but nothing great, and certainly not enough to make up for the long, boring stretches of dumb dialogue and aimless story.As Jericho, Arnold Schwarzenegger's supposed to be an alcoholic suffering a crisis of faith, a very complex character . . . and that becomes the problem.  Arnold's classic action heroes aren't complex, they're simple-minded macho men with a hatred of evil and a penchant for violence. `End of Days' needs a simple guy to take on the Devil and beat him to a pulp -- instead, the hero is this supposedly complex guy who doesn't garner much pity from the audience, and ultimately is very uninteresting and unsympathetic. As Christine York, Robin Tunney is a pretty face with nothing to do, which is a shame, because the character has lots of potential. Christine has the `gift' of seeing visions, but instead of the visions actually being useful -- such as seeing into the future, or providing insight into what's going on -- they only produce cool but useless images of evil-looking things.  Heaven forbid such a gift might be used to propel the story in an original direction.  Gabriel Byrne's Devil chews a lot of scenery but is ultimately all flash and no substance (and surprisingly incompetent).  Kevin Pollack as Chicago is perhaps the only saving grace of the film -- he's funny, and he actually moves the plot along in slightly intelligent ways -- but he's not in the film enough to redeem it, or to even make it mildly entertaining.If you're in the mood for a good Schwarzenegger action flick, rent `Predator', or `Total Recall'.  `End of Days' stinks, to put it mildly.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this piece of insipid nonsense.  Grade D+  "},{"Title":"unoriginal dreadfulness","Date":"19 January 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Arnold Schwarzenegger has (quietly) been on one of the losingest of losing streaks that any major star has had recently. Eraser, Batman and Robin, and then End of Days were all among the ten worst movies of their respective years (with B 'n R carrying the honors for 1997 in a Battlefield Earth-style runaway). Compared to the above, The Sixth Day was a major comeback.End of Days manages dreadfulness in any number of ways. The script is littered with cringe-inducing lines (including several scenes with the pope in Rome closely following the situation as if he is getting the half-inning reports on a baseball game). The action scenes are witless and unimaginative. Schwarzenegger is hopelessly miscast as a suicidal ex-cop who has lost his faith. A man with his ego has no understanding or feeling for what loss feels like, and it comes through in his performance in every scene, most notably when he is a)about to commit suicide and b)regaining his faith in God. Peter Hyams' direction seems to call for the draining of urgency or drama from any scene, and none of the cast shine. Robin Tunney is especially empty as the hapless vessel upon which Satan's lust will be vented, but Kevin Pollak is also miscast in the Tom Arnold role. Only Rod Steiger manages any degree of dignity as a priest who is able to quietly provide exposition.The plot? In 1979 a baby girl is born under the Eye of God (a full moon with a brow caused by a comet). As everyone knows, this means that she is meant to mate with Satan on the eve of the millennium and then bear the antichrist. This nooky (it is later explained) has to occur between 11 PM and Midnight on December 31, 1999 EST.Fast forward to 1999, December 27. In a chic eatery investment banker Gabriel Byrne is tracked down by a transluscent flying beasty that has emerged from the sewers followed by a series of gas main explosions (if you missed these explosions while in the popcorn line don't worry - there will be at least 20 more). The beasty is of course Satan, who takes possession of Byrne in the bathroom. Coming back out, he kisses and gropes a female diner (her husband goes 'Hey!') then walks out of the restaurant, which promptly explodes (told you so). Satan, in Byrne's form, will then contact his loyal followers in Manhattan, of whom there are thousands based on the number of extras that will later be dispatched. The Satan worshippers don't seem particularly bright - one of them is stepmother to Tunney's Christine, and it still takes Satan three days to find her. Satan displays his mercurial displeasure with them by doing things like punching through their heads. He also gets to bang their wives and daughters together, in what this movie presumes is shocking eroticism. It's not, not in this movie.So how does Arnie get involved? He's playing a security guard hired to protect Byrne/Satan when a mad priest tries to cap Byrne. He tracks down the priest's lair and puts two and two together by means of the screenplay. Why he would be interested as a rent-a-cop is beyond me, but sidekick Kevin Pollak doesn't question it, which in this movie is enough.In any case, Arnie winds up shepherding Tunney from the bad guys and the bad good guys (a sect of Roman catholic priests called the Vatican Knights who want to kill her and her unborn baby before she can be impregnated, certainly against the Pope's views on abortion). Of course, in the meantime he will be challenged by the devil, lose the girl, cap off a lot of people, be involved in explosions, and get crucified. Somehow, the police are fortunately not around when all this fun is happening.The biggest failing in all this witlessness is the portrayal of Satan. Byrne isn't compelling, but he doesn't have much of a chance given the mechanics of the script. Satan's approach to finding his bride is pretty much like that of the terminator - just keep looking and killing the people in your way. Nowhere does the film give Satan the benefit of knowing all men's weaknesses, powerful charisma, Satanic cleverness, an ability to dodge bullets or kill Arnold Schwarzenegger just by wishing it was so. Satan is supposed to be virtually omnipotent - I mean, the guy is fighting God, right? One rent-a-cop should be a laughable matter. But not for this Satan. Want to get away from him? Fill him full of holes and then peel out!I thought Eraser was the worse movie, but this one is simply a dumb reason to blow things up in a very unoriginal way. If you have to have your antichrist, Stir of Echoes, Stigmata, or Lost Souls will all do you better. If only Robert De Niro's Louis Cyphre could have shown up - the whole plot would have been over in 15 minutes.

You decide which was worst.Me, I have never remotely understood what the fuss was about. Schwarzenegger was and is a big stiff lacking even the most basic acting tools, who has moaned and groaned his way through so many dimwitted and expensive Hollywood vehicles that I have lost count.As an actor he leaves so painstakingly much left to be desired, that I wouldn't know where to begin. Ah-nuld, as he is lovingly dubbed by fans and critics alike, really is an institution. He's like a computer game. Like one of those `shoot-em ups¬¥. What you get is what you expect. Every time.So watching this movie on opening night in a cinema full of Arnie buffs (blue-collar, white males mostly) really was something of a shock. Some were boohooing sporadically after just ten minutes. Why is that? Easy. Because this movie bravely presents Arnie in a new light. He puts one foot out of his typecast cocoon &#150; lo and behold &#150; he gets jumped by his own fans.Do they care that End Of Days is clearly his most original and homogenic work since the first Terminator? No, they squirmed in their seats because they wanted big brawn, lots of guns and a bunch of stupid one-liners (hasta la vista style) from the get-go.As if they were asking Arnold always delivered in the past, so what gives? The funny thing is &#150; End Of Days does deliver.It delivers, and in a much more subtle and relaxed way than any of his past movies ever did, including James Cameron favorites Terminator 2 and the overly loud, sexist and ludicrous Bond rip-off, True Lies from 1994.The difference being that End of Days actually has an issue worth more than an abrupt macho statement and that it sets its own pace early on. It effectively blends horror and gore with straight-faced and classic Ah-nuld mega action, spiced with both humor and even adventure. While the entire recipe is old and sometimes annoying (Kevin Pollak's constant comic comments can be a strain) it never comes across tired or contrived.Confusing as it may be (and occasionally funny do not start to decipher either time zone logic or how 666 is suddenly 999 and thereby 1999), End Of Days seems oddly fresh throughout.This is mainly because the movie steals left and right and with such haste that you are busy lapping it all in. There are connections to many movies (most notably Rosemary's Baby, Omen, Blade Runner, Seven, The Matrix), but director Peter Hyams moves forward in his own admirable and unique style and lends End Of Days a rare continuity.Especially considering the weight he is carrying and has to balance out here, and Ah-nuld &#150; mind  you &#150; he's a load if there ever was one.Has his acting improved? Not really, and his accent is still as bad as it ever was, but his engagement is loose and the focus on him is lessened, and this kind of low-key approach is very fitting.Our man is trimmed at 52, and he is still the star, sure, but backed by such an effective film-noir (some wonderful scenery of New York City) and some good sparring from Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger and especially Byrne, he really doesn't halt the proceedings to the point where you start to get annoyed.Byrne as Satan is a steal. Once more we are reminded of past movies (Al Pacino in Devils Advocate), but his performance is both hypnotic and provocative. He also seems strangely at ease against Schwarzenegger, and the two share the movie's greatest moment. Together in Jericho Cane's (Arnie) apartment, the two engage on a verbal battle regarding faith. Great stuff indeed.A question I was armed with beforehand was does Ah-nuld just kick the devil's butt? Does violence overcome evil? And if so I would be ready to crucify (no pun intended) End Of Days right there.That would clearly be on the terms of the old Schwarzenegger movies then. No, again the movie is well rounded. There is a whole lot of shooting going on as the devil has taken over Byrne's human body and is therefore somewhat fragile, but always with the sense of something grand and invisible lurking behind the curtains.Subsequently the ending &#150; a nice touch that is dished out perfectly by Hyams &#150; is all about faith. It is about temptations and traps, about life and death, about holding ship when everything else collapses.While it may seem clich√©d (a priest even goes `It is in our darkest hour that we must show our real faith.'), End Of Days addresses an issue of faith, not necessarily in terms of Christianity nor Satanism, but one that is universal thus making the movie both somewhat poignant and rewarding.Jericho Cane is rewarded too &#150; so to speak. By whom or what we (luckily) never learn. End Of Days doesn't stray from the initial path. Well done.So is End Of Days simply an apocalyptic thriller or a doomsday shootout? Well, both actually, yet it is also beautifully filmed and scored and while it has plot-holes the size of Wyoming, this Ah-nuld vehicle is frankly entertaining as hell. Pun intended.

On the way back to Los Angeles I got stuck in one of those soul-sucking Highway 60 traffic jams. So I pulled into a mall - a sure sign of desperation - and figured a multiplex had to offer two hours of something better than sitting in my car. I've rarely been more mistaken.Okay. I should have known. Peter Hyams is God's object lesson for Hollywood, a warning to be careful what you wish for would you really want a career consistently directing the worst movies their respective stars ever made? And of course Arnold's no slouch when it comes to picking bad scripts. But the trailer had Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak, who were so recently so good in USUAL SUSPECTS; plus the always apocalyptic Rod Steiger; and when was Udo Kier bad? So I was in a way rewarded. Entertainment is a relative concept; it all depends what you're looking for. As a connoisseur of bad movies, I came to appreciate this abortion, so perfectly ridiculous it's even well-named.Andrew Marlowe is the kind of writer who pits a guy with a machine gun against Satan, and has Satan lose; END OF DAYS is the kind of movie that gives the devil, as his first fleshly act... what? What's evil enough for the Lord of Flies? That's right. He cops a feel and gives somebody a nasty look. This is a Lucifer impervious to a ten story defenestration but afraid of being shot (but who then gets shot and is more worried about his clothes), whose most despicable atrocity is a threesome to a bad Everlast rap, who urinates flammable blood but has to open his own doors, who with the entire villainous world at his disposal has chosen minions as incompetent as they are disobedient, who can't find his way around Manhattan without following signs, who seems less malevolent than pissy (so easily annoyed that he pushes skateboarders in front of buses), and who is easily outsmarted by a steroid casualty whose only convincing acting job was playing a robot. Mostly it's too bad for Gabriel Byrne, one of those fine actors cursed with never being in a good movie. His touch, for some reason, perhaps in expiation of some youthful blasphemy, is absolute poison to the quality of whatever project he's in. What else? You got a good guy named Cane and a bad guy named Abel - clever, huh? You got Schwarzenegger, eating a stale-pizza breakfast shake ripped off from a Brian Bosworth movie, as the 666th incarnation of a suicidal drunken ex-cop with a dead wife and kid. Right along with it you got the heavy saying to the hero, for the 999th time, some version of We're not so different, you and I. You got Rod Steiger riffing on his own I'm on medication press conferences, screaming and staggering through helpful advice like, Often in dreams numbers appear upside down and backwards. Darkest of all, you got Robin Tunney giving another performance so sulfurous that she seems less likely the mother of Antichrist than the beast itself.The best part came after I crawled from the theater, got back on the 60... and into the same traffic jam.

That would actually be true. The list posted is truly indeed, the only fine points about this crap of a waste of an hour and a half of my life of a movie. I was laughing out loud as I was reading through the reasons that person listed. Absolutely hilarious. Here's what I think. Arnie gave the Devil hell. He single handedly killed a Predator. He defeated evil clones of himself. A couple of times I might add. Once in the future and once in the future on a distant planet. Took out the whole of the Columbian drug cartel and guerilla terrorist cell, all the while as a forced to resign fireman. He survived the most heinous murderous reality T.V. show full of professional killers. Saved his one and only daughter from evil plotting terrorists. Not only once, but twice. As Hercules, he played the half-god son of Zeus. He was the baddest Barbarian in the all lands. Trained to be a killing machine that could take on evil sorcerers and sorceress in his sleep. Not to mention, he was the sole savior of little John Conner and the whole human race, once more, on multiple occasions. But he couldn't please all those voters. Damn those Cali taxes and pot holes... What were they thinking? Who cares. End of Days is crap. I actually think it made me stupider for having sat through it.

Even if you only spend .50 on a DVDR to rip this movie, there is a body of water somewhere you could make a wish on that would be money better spent. Just to explain a little more... I went to see this movie when it was released because it had such a remarkable soundtrack. Talk about blind bad luck. There were a few scenes that remain mentionable. Namely, the mother/daughter-Devil love fest. That was hot. LOL But that's all this movie was worth. A few good laughs at how horrible it is, is more like it. I was so enraged that I had paid good money to watch such horrendous, well everything, that I decided that the theater was going to let me watch a good movie for free. So, while I was exiting the local movie megaplex I managed to dart into a nearby theater to watch Sleepy Hollow. Thank the powers that be for redeeming my faith and reminding me that not all Hollywood movies are complete trash. Some directors actually take pride in their work. Really. Thank you Tim Burton. However, I still feel that I am permanently scarred and somewhat retarded for having watched the entirety of what is End of Days. I have not, nor will I ever, subject what little is left of my brain to the direct trauma and torture, of said movie again. It was a decision that I greatly regret, that I had chosen Arnie over Tim Burton originally when I went to the theater to watch a movie. Never again will I make that mistake.

What I found depressing was that Peter Hyams has done some really fine work. Apparently he felt compelled to allow End of Days to degenerate into a junk pile of explosions, gunfire, creepy dream sex, and CGI slaughter. There could have been a riveting little story of Satan hunting for a mate somewhere in this garbage, but I don't think it ever crossed the minds of anyone involved to tone it down and scare it up!
