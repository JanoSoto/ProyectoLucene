I spent the weekend catching up on my Christopher Guest films, and watched `A Mighty Wind' then `Best in Show' and saved Guffman for last.  While I still thought `A Mighty Wind' was better, (in the same way that Sprite is better than 7-Up&#133; there's really no difference, just maybe an iota of something indescribable that is better) `Waiting for Guffman' is still huddled in there with `Best in Show' as a fantastic film.One thing that I noticed about `Guffman' over the others is that while all of his films have a little heart to them, this film had just a little bit more.  I can also see that Guest, while having more of an acting role in this film, went on to lessen his roles substantially, but he really is a good actor.  All of the actors show immense versatility, (especially Catherine O'Hara, whose hair in this film made me laugh constantly) but Guest actually surprised me.  The fact that the films are primarily ad-libbed is most impressive in `Guffman' in my opinion, and the direction, while very subtle in all of the films, does not rely on editing to lead (or sometimes, create) a gag as much as his later films do. All of Guest's films are fairly short (clocking in at 90 minutes or less) so I would suggest that if you haven't seen any or all of his mockumentaries, to just schedule a film festival with some friends and watch them in order.  It's fun to compare them, and to watch the same actors take on different personas, and `Waiting for Guffman' is a strong and hilarious piece of work.--Shelly  "},{"Title":"But You Don't Have To Wait For The Laughs","Date":"25 June 2001","Score":"27 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  	Civic pride and the desire to perform bring an eclectic group of people together in the mock documentary, or `mockumentary,' `Waiting for Guffman,' directed by Christopher Guest.  As he did with his more recent outing, `Best In Show,' Guest uses his satirical format to tell the story of the good people of Blaine, Mo., who are planning a celebration to commemorate the sesquicentennial of their fair town, the highlight of which will be a play depicting the history of Blaine.  And how fortunate they are, as the celebrated director Corky St. Clair (Guest), who has had some close encounters with Broadway, has recently settled down in Blaine and has agreed to undertake the monumental task of directing the play, which he decides to present as a musical.  He has the High School band/music teacher, Lloyd Miller (Bob Balaban) to provide the music; now all he has to do is assemble his cast.  So he posts an announcement for auditions, and with that, the action begins.	St. Clair has a grand vision of what his musical will be, and once rehearsals begin and he realizes just how good it is, he contacts some people he knows from his brush with the Great White Way, who agree to send a representative, Guffman, to see the show.  St. Clair, of course, is walking on air, as he sees this as a chance at the big time; he's convinced they're going all the way to Broadway with this one.  And on the night of the show, anticipation runs high as St. Clair and the members of the cast wait for Guffman to arrive.  They've even reserved a folding chair in the front row for him, and as the curtain goes up, they hold their breath awaiting the first glimpse of The Man himself.	Guest takes you through the whole process, from the auditions to the final show, and through interviews you get to know the townsfolk and their feelings about living in Blaine and their thoughts on the sesquicentennial and St. Clair's elaborate musical.  And as you meet these people, I guarantee you're going to run into more than a few from your own experience; and anyone who's ever had anything to do with community theater on any level, is definitely going to be able to identify with the characters and situations presented here.  Written by Guest and Eugene Levy, the screenplay is rife with insight into human nature on a level with anything ever written by Thackeray or Twain.  The humor is dry and subtle; never forced, it evolves totally from the characters and the situations Guest and Levy have created.  And, as David Byrne did with `True Stories,' they play up the humor of every day life in a small town without ever making fun or maligning it in any way; there are no `cheap shots' employed just for the sake of a laugh.  It's all delivered good-naturedly and with taste.  If they seem to be laughing at anyone, rest assured, it's themselves above all.	Among those involved in bringing this piece of Americana to life are Fred Willard as Ron Albertson, and Catherine O'Hara as his wife, Sheila, who together run a local travel agency, but are entertainers at heart and jump at the chance to perform in St. Clair's musical; Parker Posey as Libby Mae Brown, who hopes to leave her job at the Dairy Queen behind when the show moves to Broadway; Eugene Levy as Dr. Allan Pearl, a dentist with a latent desire to perform who finally gets his chance with St. Clair; and Matt Keeslar as Johnny Savage, the mechanic who never realized where he real talents lay until St. Clair came along, and winds up on the stage, much to the chagrin of his dubious father, Red, played by Brian Doyle-Murray.  The performances by one and all are first rate, and it gives that necessary sense of realism to the film that really makes it work; these are not actors you're watching, but real people in a very real town.	The supporting cast includes Don Lake (Blaine Historian Phil Burgess), Paul Dooley (UFO Abductee), Linda Kash (Mrs. Pearl), Miriam Flynn (Costume Dresser), Jill Parker-Jones (Stage Manager), Larry Miller (Glen Welsch, Mayor), Deborah Theaker (Gwen Fabin-Blunt, Councilwoman), Michael Hitchcock (Steve Stark, Councilman) and Scott Williamson (Tucker Livingston, Councilman).  Alfred Hitchcock may be the Master of Suspense, but with `Waiting for Guffman,' Christopher Guest proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is the Master of the `Mockumentary.'  He has an eye for detail and an innate sense of what makes people tick, and he fills his film with all the nuance and quirks of life that can be found every day in any small town or metropolis across the country.  With this film he holds up the mirror and says, `Go ahead, take a look,' and it gives you a chance to let your hair down and perhaps realize that everything isn't quite as serious as it seems sometimes; a chance to laugh at yourself and the guy next to you, with nothing but the best intentions, while affording you the opportunity of just having some good, old fashioned fun.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

Corky drafts an odd assortment of local talent to bring his historical revue to life, including the local dentist (Levy) and travel agent couple (O'Hara and Willard).  Like Spinal Tap, this film mercilessly spoofs the artistic pretentions of Corky and his cast, but the audience ends up feeling genuine affection for the characters, the provincial backwater of Blaine, and even Corky's awful show with laughable music and acting.  Guest's performance, as well as several of the others, is very funny and memorable.

Instead of a clearly defined script, some very talented actors (such as Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and others) took a script idea and improvised throughout. The film was then created using the best bits and I can honestly say that there is nothing like this film. While some of the jokes are very, very dry and occasionally fall flat, there is a subtle charm and wit to the film as you follow a group of 3rd rate local actors who have insane visions of Broadway.The film is ostensibly about a very local stage production about the founding of some small town. While these sort of pageants have been ubiquitous in small town America, this one is unique because supposedly a guy by the name of Guffman is coming to town and plans two see it. Guffman, it seems, is from Broadway and the cast has the temerity to believe that maybe they'll impress him so much that they'll become major stars. Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations.I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

We should thank our lucky stars for Christopher Guest, a consistently surprising filmmaker (he directed Best in Show and wrote This is Spinal Tap) who makes 'mockumentaries' that play like actual documentaries. Waiting for Guffman follows Corky St. Clair (Guest), a flamboyant stage director who gathers a group of 'eclectic' locals (a cross-eyed dentist; a husband-and-wife travel agent team; a Dairy Queen employee) for a production about the sleepy town in which they live (its claim to fame being home of the footstool). There is a hilarious authenticity to the behind-the-scenes footage, but the film never laughs at its subjects--as viewers, we share Corky's (admittedly delusional) passion with bittersweet good humor. The supporting cast--consisting of Guest regulars Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Bob Balaban, and Larry Miller--is in top form here. Waiting for Guffman is a quiet comedy gem about a dull, quiet town. And it's also ridiculously rated R for two quick instances of F-word usage (way to call it, MPAA!).

For instance, in Ron & Sheila's audition with their treatment of Midnight At The Oasis, it took me about 10 viewings til I noticed that Sheila is mouthing the words to Ron because of his problems remembering his lines.I really don't know where to begin listing my favorite things about this movie - Ron's medical reason for his sole trip outside of Blaine, Dr. Pearl's Carson impressions, Sheila's less-is-more acting approach, Corky's tantrums (I hate you, and I hate your ass face!), Libba Mae's description of her job at Dairy Queen, councilman Steve Stark admiration for Corky (GOD, I wish I was in the show), there is not a wasted moment in this film.  It's stupid of me to try to list them here.The extras on the DVD feature a ton of scenes that weren't in the movie. There's some additional Corky items in his memorabilia collection, including towels from Hamlet On Ice, alternate epilogues for both Ron & Sheila and also Dr. Pearl, a scene of Corky driving around town telling people they made the cast, a nutty scene of Ron's whiffle-ball reenactment of Bill Mazeroski's famous home-run, dinner at Johnny Savage's house, and extra stuff from the musical - Nothing Ever Happens In Blaine, This Bulging River and also a whacked-out White House scene.  But the piece de resistance of the deleted scenes is Libby Mae's other audition piece which is so subtly twisted that you just need to see it yourself.It's debatable whether this movie is outright cruel in making fun of small townsfolk & community theater types.

We saw this film when it was originally released, but caught it recently in the retrospect of Mr. Guest's films shown recently here.Waiting for Guffman is, to this humble viewer, probably his best creation to date. Not only is this a funny movie, it shows the genius of Mr. Guest at his best.Corky St. Clair, the director from the New York stage seems completely out of place in Blaine, Mo. He is too witty for that small little town, where he is clearly adored, not only by the local thespians, but by the whole municipal council. Some of the lines one hears coming from Corky's mouth are so amazing that one wonders if the citizens of Blaine fully realize they have a gem living in town.The players auditioning for Corky's new production about Blaine's beginnings, live in a world of themselves. Ron and Sheila Albertson, are the star of other productions, so they return again for the new show. Libby Mae Brown works in the Dairy Queen, but her ambition is to be a star. Even the local dentist, Dr. Allan Pearl, is attracted to become a performer.There are two other underlying plots going on in the film. There is the history part, or how Blaine came to be, and the other notorious incident of the flying saucer that came into town and took several of the citizens for a tour of the space craft and we are being told about it by the people that experienced that adventure.Christopher Guest makes a wonderful Corky St. Clair. Mr. Guest knows what makes Corky great. Corky, no doubt, is a composite of people Mr. Guest must have known at one time or another. Corky is an enormous achievement for Mr. Guest as a writer and as a performer.Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara are incredible in their take of the Albertsons, the travel agents without a clue of what's going on outside Blaine. Ron's delicate operation is explained in some detail to the horrified Mrs. Pearl. Eugene Levy, Mr. Guest's frequent collaborator is right on the money as the dentist with singing aspirations. Parker Posey, is the girl who thinks Broadway is only a few steps away. Paul Dooley, Don Lake, Larry Miller,Linda Kash, are among the citizens of Blaine one gets to know in the film.Of course, none of this would have been possible without Christopher Guest. It's a shame we don't get to see more of him, but that makes even better whatever he decides to offer us from time to time.

What never ceases to amaze is that these 'improvised' characters have more depth, subtlety and believability than the large majority of traditionally crafted and scripted characters. Equally as impressive is the refusal to turn any character into an object of derision. For all their seeming vacuous vanity and ego driven foibles, these are essentially good people. The entire movie is infused with a benign joy and heartfelt warmth that is irresistible.As others have said, the highlight of the movie is a scene that can only be seen in the DVD extras &#150; Libby Mae Brown's audition monologue &#150; an incredibly well written and executed performance that reveals more about her character and Posie's talent than many award winning turns.As ever, the musical numbers by 'Taps' Guest, McKean and Shearer are brilliant &#150; catchy and witty and performed just on the right side of endearing amateurishness.An excellent movie, that compensates for the lack of laugh-out-loud moments with well crafted, beautifully realized characters, and inspired songs.

My expectations of what an amusement park should be had been in the way.Likewise, your expectations of what a movie comedy should be can get in your way when viewing Waiting for Guffman. If you have been raised on Hollywood's standard punchline-a-minute or gross-out comedies and are expecting the same here, you will be disappointed. The humor is subtle and character-driven.That having been said, Guffman is funnier than a dozen in-your-face movie comedies put together. Director Christopher Guest assembled a group of talented actors and assigned to each of them a small-town character. He then gave each character the opportunity to be an UN-talented actor in a community production. The majority of the dialog is unscripted, and the show the actors are called on to do is horrendously bad, but laughs flow from the sincerity of the characters and their (very unearned) high opinion of their talent and their show.Full of gentle digs at small-town life and amateur theater, Waiting for Guffman is not your typical comedy, but it is very funny and well worth your time -- as long as you don't expect it to be something it's not.Oh, and as noted elsewhere in these user comments, don't miss the closing credits.

Principally, Guffman follows a group of people who (think they) are on life's upslope, building toward a great achievement of teamwork in showbiz. Guest's other movies with the same cast--viz. Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration--are far more concerned with portraying the pathos of the has-been. In Guffman, Guest's character, Corky, is the only has-been, and then only if you count '10 years living in New York and failing auditions' as achieving something in show business. Guffman's characters are small town people at their most stereotypical ordinary selves, people yearning for a brush with the magic of being a part of a really good play. Consider Parker Posey's performance as Libby Mae Brown, the Dairy Queen worker. Posey tells you everything you need to know about the listless ennui of being stuck in a place with nothing to do and no way to grow with a couple of wordless moments where she looks away, her eyes reverberating what is not being said about the failure of dreams. Or take Bob Balaban's portrayal of the quietly suffering music teacher, deposed as the director of the town's annual play in favor of the terrible infant that is Corky (who has lived in New York, after all). The scene where Balaban's character reacts to Corky's reappearance at the helm of the production is a master class in comedic character acting in the most tissue-subtle way that it can be delivered.The thing about the failure of never-weres (as opposed to has-beens) is that the failure brings no sanction, no shame. Americans are raised on tales of The Little Engine That Could and Abe Lincoln's failed political campaigns before he became the greatest President in history. In America, if you aren't yet anything, and you try, we root for you. If you fail and try again, we find ourselves rooting twice as hard. This striving of small town nobodys towards the stardust of Broadway, home of another Abe, Abe Guffman, gives this film an emotional resonance fundamentally different from Guest's many other projects (even Spinal Tap). The result is that by the end of the film, we're not at all tired of the characters, or annoyed or sapped by their failure to get discovered. Guest could assemble a new script and make the sequel, could make a Guffman 2, and it would succeed with both his core audience and with a general audience, because everybody (in America, anyway) loves to see a first-timer try to make it big, whether it is their first attempt, or their tenth.

"},{"Title":"The Christopher Guest Show","Date":"29 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" A small town in Missouri is celebrating the 150 years of its existence, and the people gather together to make a remarkable musical play telling the story of the city celebrating its great historical moments. In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of Waiting for Guffman the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in This is Spinal Tap was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made a penis reduction because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing.But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film The Remains of the Day, Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of My Dinner With Andre). Nice film. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Waiting for Godot, I mean, Guffman","Date":"9 December 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Waiting for Guffman (1996) THE FINEST assemblage of straight-faced comedians in all of history, create one of THE funniest movies EVER. Waiting for Guffman is about humans with more than enough faith...AND self-delusions. Christopher Guest is the driving force, both in front of and behind the camera, and along with Eugene Levy, portray a small town's population creating a small play about their small history, which is a VERY BIG deal to them. Guest's consistent theme (throughout his films) is about humans who don't have enough insight or talent to spot the lack of it within themselves. There is an incredible blind faith, tenderness and embarrassing, misguided drive within these people. And yet, within their little world, they support the dreams for one another, and move through their lives with solid delusion. This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind are other great examples. Guest also has the sense to call back his actors for further projects. This is brilliant work.

It's a sweet send-up of small town America that comes across like an extended version of Second City Review or Saturday Night Live. Sure, some of the parody is pointed, but it's never mean-spirited. Blaine, Missouri, in the heart of the state, is having its 150th anniversary, and by golly the town's theatrical types are going to do it up right. Never mind that the talent is spread pretty thin from the stage struck town dentist (Eugene Levy), to travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara), to Dairy Queen princess (Parker Posey). Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), temporarily on leave from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says.It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success. Naturally, we expect the final result, the pageant performance before the whole town, to nose-dive., But it doesn't. Instead, the stage performance comes across rather sweetly, with just the right amount of unpolished success that brings the whole town to its feet in a boffo finale. What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise. But for darn sure this little sleeper goes into my tape library for repeated viewing.

His part-improv mockumentaries are some of the best comedies in recent cinematic history. 'Waiting for Guffman' is the first.The film focuses on the small-town of Blaine's sesquicentennial (that's 150th) celebration and the original play 'Red, White, and Blaine.' Blaine, MO, is, as everyone knows. . . the stool capital of the world. By 'stool,' I mean the one you sit on. Not the, well, you get it.Complications arise in the production when Broadway announces they're sending a representative (Guffman, as the title suggests) to see the show with the chance of sending it to New York City! However, Corky (Christopher Guest), the off-off-off-off Broadway director in charge of the production, (briefly) leaves the production due to financial complications between him and the town council.Things eventually start to run smooth, however, and the production goes on for the town, and it's a good one at that! Great performances by the usual cast (Eugene Levy, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Guest, and Parker Posey) make this film one comedy (deeper than most, I must mention). Do not 'Wait'!

Those not worth seeing, those worth seeing again and again, and those worth a single viewing. In other words, some movies are a single bag of popcorn experience. Waiting for Guffman comes under the latter category. Seeing it more than once may diminish it as it doesn't really have much more to say than what the typical movie-goer will pretty much absorb in less than 90 minutes. There are some underlying themes but they are applied with a sledge-hammer. Simultaneously, this is a movie more for people in the entertainment industry, particularly in the Broadway scene, as there are a few in-jokes. Some friends of mine who have worked in live theater swear by it as one of the funniest movies they have ever seen. Not quite as wacky as Airplane or This is Spinal Tap (which was made by the same people minus Rob Reiner), but Guffman has its moments.Briefly, the film is a mockumentary (a satirical comedy done in documentary form, like Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run) about the ridiculousness of small-town theater, and maybe the ridiculousness of small-town Midwest American culture. In short, how Midwest small-town America has about as much culture as the outhouses that line the city blocks during a parade down Main Street. Or at least that's how the filmmakers view the community of Blaine, as a nondescript backward American mistake in Missouri that probably doesn't even show up on the map. Of course the rhetorical viewpoint is a gross stereotype in and of itself. Even the raunchiest of wild west towns occasionally performed Shakespeare. But to get the laughs, the filmmakers portray Blaine as the kind of town that probably thinks Gomer Pyle USMC is high art.The thrust of the story, if you can call it a story, is Blaine's attempt to produce a musical based on the history of their town. The details of which could probably be jotted down on a piece of notebook paper and you'd still have more than a page and a half left to fill in a grocery shopping list. The mayor and council members have hired a gay wanna-be Broadway actor/writer/director, Corky St. Clair (Christopher Guest, who also directs the film), to write and oversee the musical. Everything is over of the top, which is of course the point. Simultaneously, Guest as the gay musical director was a little much, even for a film that is supposed to be purely for laughs. His gay personality is incredibly stereotypical, and in many scenes he acts exactly as you would expect him, getting unmanageably hysterical over minute details, or emotional when things don't work his way. Maybe I wanted something a little more to him than just the typical gay director who always has his hands on his hips. The other characters, chiefly the actors and actresses who get the parts for the musical, of course believe they are all unknown stars waiting to happen, destined for stardom, but just never had the chance before. And at one point, the cast is promised that Mr Guffman, a talent scout and agent from New York, will travel to Blaine to see their musical and help launch everybody's careers. Hence the title.Then there is the play itself, the musical about Blaine. Unfortunately, it is not just Bad (capital B) but it is not so bad it's good, of the Plan 9 From Outer Space variety. It is just plain bad. Or idiotic is the better word. It's a romp through Blaine's history, which actually makes Romper Room look like Gone With the Wind. The story is narrated directly to the audience by an old coot at a campfire. Just before curtain, we learn that one of the young male actors won't be appearing and Corky will take his place. This was for me the lowest moment of the film. Corky as the replacement makes no attempt to become the character he is playing, but instead just lets his gay personality shine through, particularly during a duet with a young woman where he is supposed to be a young heterosexual soldier about to go to World War I. I felt the scene bordered offensiveness, as a true Broadway actor worth his salt would, whether gay or not, attempt to act in character that was relatively consistent with the script. I think it would have been far funnier if he tried desperately to be more masculine a la Cage aux Folles with tragic results.Given these shortcomings, Guffman has its moments. Maybe too many of them. The auditions sequence is almost unbearable, obviously poking fun at the idea that terrible talent always thinks they are much better than they are. A sort of American Idol meets The Gong Show. Some of the best moments are interviews with the locals who trace their history back to the original foundation of Blaine, in which 19th-century pioneers supposedly thought they had reached the west coast and didn't realize they were 2000 miles off before deciding to create their town. Which is of course the idea behind the creation of the Blaine musical and being more than somewhat ill-conceived. Larry Miller as the town mayor is priceless, almost perfect casting. I would have liked a little more screen time for Bob Balaban as the music teacher who conducts the lifeless orchestra. Check out the trumpet player if you get a chance! You have to credit writer/actor/director Guest for at least the most improbable and highly original idea for comedic satire. Maybe it would have actually been funnier and more insightful if Guest had found a town in heartland America and uncovered what made them tick instead of lapsing into such exaggerated stereotypes.

When he learns that a Broadway producer is sending someone (Mr Guffman) to see the production, he, the cast, and the whole town suddenly sense the possibility of being in the national spotlight. The result of this pseudo-documentary is a cast of over-the-top deeply flawed characters who say completely unexpected and outrageous things that, within the context of the film, are actually believable. Most of the actors portray characters we have seen them do many times before but, Waiting for Guffman allows them to take those familiar characters to places they've never been on the screen.

Movies like Waiting for Guffman further that argument. The quiet, yet very funny effort from Best In Show and A Mighty Wind writer/director Christopher Guest and writer Eugene Levy details the triumphs and failures of small-town America putting on a play retracing the history of Blaine, Missouri, founded by a band of brothers trying to find California. It's sly humor, sprinkled throughout the movie, that make this a charming look at America. Guest, Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard, Parker Posey, Larry Miller, and David Cross headline the comedy troupe that improvises their way through the auditions, rehearsals, and performance of the play Red, White, and Blaine! Each smalltime actor is motivated, not by wanting to capture the town's history in play form, but rather because Broadway talent scout Mort Guffman is supposed to attend the play, possibly giving each actor their big break. Of course there are various other small episodes throughout the movie that gives Waiting for Guffman it's humor. Willard and O'Hara are travel agents who set up their clients on trips from Miami to Paris, but themselves have never left the town of Blaine. Levy is a dentist who thinks he's funny, but have you ever met a funny dentist? And Guest is over the top in his portrayal of Corkey St. Clair, the flaming director of the play. The last act of the film is the play itself, and is it's own source of comedy, featuring the song Nothing Ever Happens on Mars, recounting the time a UFO supposedly landed in Blaine. The movie is quick, there is no fat, and very funny. Most of the humor comes from small details, so pay attention to the small things, and you'll love this even more.

I don't know if any gay men or politically-correct viewers might be offended by the character of Corky St. Clair, but I have seen so many gay men - especially in the theater world - who look and act like Corky does (with the possible exception of his temper flare-ups). I don't know how to describe Guest's brand of humor, but it's distinctive and in this movie very reminiscent of So This is Spinal Tap. Interestingly, on second viewing (with commentary), I laughed a lot harder at some jokes, such as Parker Posey barbecuing one miniscule chicken wing and nothing else.

It wasn't very funny, I said, and worse, Guest doesn't seem to understand the whole concept of the pseudo-documentary which Rob Reiner used so brilliantly in THIS IS SPINAL TAP. While the genius of TAP is that it almost perfectly recreates the documentary feel (with only one fairly minor misstep that I can see), A MIGHTY WIND simply doesn't play like a documentary. However, it's obvious that Guest is a talented guy, and anyway, I had a free Blockbuster coupon, so I decided to rent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.GUFFMAN suffers from many of the the same stylistic shortcomings as WIND characters and situations which are movie-quirky rather than realistically quirky, shots which don't make sense in a documentary format, too many cameras (none of which ever get caught by another camera, funnily enough) during the onstage scenes, and a trumpeter who quite obviously isn't actually playing.However, GUFFMAN is funnier than WIND, and having sat down not expecting the film to play like a documentary, it wasn't nearly so jarring when it didn't. As a straight comedy, ignoring the whole documentary thing, it's quite good.

But, it is definitely a well-written and funny movie that looks into the lives of small midwest actors. I liked this movie for many small-but-great reasons. The subtle humor works perfectly and the acting is extremely good. The shots of everybody in the audience is so dead on! The best acting (IMO) occurs in the last 15 minutes or so. I have seen Spinal Tap once and tried to watch Best In Show and didn't really like them. But! Waiting For Guffman has made me a believer out of these comedies. True, they are not for everyone. I admit I love slapstick and raunchy humor (Naked Gun,Airplane!). But I also appreciate this movie as well. I hate saying this because so many others have said it, too. But, if you don't like this movie you probably aren't smart enough to. It's not an average movie-goers genre at all. It requires the viewer to actually pay attention and notice the little things. Case in point-the scenes with the orchestra would appear to be pointless to someone who doesn't get it. But those scenes are so good at mocking reality!! It took me awhile, but I can say I'm a fan of Guest's work now. And I have Waiting For Guffman to thank!

This mocumentary revolves around Corky and the musical's participants as they go through auditions, rehearsals, and the actual performance.  The characters are well-developed and they all have very humorous monologues (the movie was improvised; there was no script).

If you've enjoyed his other stuff (This is Spinal Tap and Best In Show), then you're sure to enjoy Waiting For Guffman.Guest plays Corky St. Clair as the Broadway wannabe who never quite made it.  Now he lives in Blaine Missouri and he's just been chosen to direct the play Red, White, and Blaine.  His last play, Backdraft The Musical caused a ruckus and the whole idea of Ron Howard's movie being made into a musical is hilarious in itself.  The laughs come fast, making multiple viewings necessary.  I watched it three times, catching something different every time and I'm still not sure whether I've caught everything.  Sometimes the laughs are almost too subtle, but that's just part of what makes this one so brilliant.  There's a whole cast of well-knowns here, each delivering a hilarious, convincing performance and the whole thing capatures small-town life to a tee.  As the film's funniest character, Christopher Guest gives the outrageous Corky  a lisp that's most commonly associated with gays.  Whether Corky is gay or not, is never confirmed but it is kind of strange how he refers to his wife Bunny, even shops for her clothes, but no one has ever seen her... His temper tantrums are hilarious (ex the scene where he requests $100,000 to do the play) and he does have some pretty mean dance moves (priceless).  Seriously, if you like a good comedy and want something just a little different than the norm, check this one out.

It's worth listening to the comments on the DVD just to hear Levy's comments about Corky's (Guest) choreography and how he couldn't keep a straight face while performing certain dance numbers.Guest has nailed the small-town feeling and the quality of local theater productions.  I had the same reaction as the town council members, when Corky asks for $100,000 after learning that the show might be viewed by a Broadway producer.

Each year studios and filmakers upped the ante on just how disgusting a film could slip by the MPAA. While there were some funny films in there, There's Something About Mary and South Park B.L.U.,  most of the comedies released were just flat out stupid. Even Woody Allen struck a reef in the 90's. Celebrity comes rushing to my mind here.  While there wasn't much brain power being put to use in the studio system, the independent film industry showed that they had some brains and knew how to make a truely funny film.Filmed as a fake documentary, Waiting For Guffman tells the story of a small town USA's brief, (very brief) run in with showbiz. To commemorate 150th anniversary of the founding of Blaine, Missouri (the stool capital of the world), the town leaders commission a play, which is to be about Blaine's history. As you may have guessed, this isn't exactly going to be a high budget, professionally done production, but the local folks involved in the play don't seem to realize this.What makes the film brilliant is that Guest creates a group of widely diverse characters and puts them together in a situation, specifically the play. The interactions the characters have are just flat out hilarious. There's the flaming gay director who no one seems to realize is gay or a hack, a Jewish Dentist, a white trash girl who works at the DQ and two married travel agents who think that they really are actors.

Unfortunately, I found Guffman to be only so-so at best.  The performances were generally a bit too broad;  had they played the characters just a bit straighter, it would've helped significantly. But a bigger problem was the overall lack of comic tension.  One of the things that made TISS work was the constant clash between Tap's inflated expectations and the humiliating reality to which they were subjected.  Part of the hilarity of something like the Stonehenge sequence or the Army gig was watching Tap grimly attempt to make the best of things time and time again despite miserable circumstances;  as a result, we can't help but sympathize with the poor buggers, and the comic effect is heightened through our identification with them. But in Guffman, that factor is minimal -- there's no one, except perhaps Guffman, in front of whom the characters would embarrass themselves;  everyone in the movie is more or less equally intoxicated by the ridiculousness of amateur theater. There's no risk, no moment at which we say to ourselves Oh, no... on behalf of the characters.  (During the audition sequences, I thought there would be, but Corky St. Clair's positive reaction disabused me of that notion.) Consequently, instead of sympathy and identification, we feel ironic detachment and a sense of superiority -- and for me, at least, that keeps the humor from ever really taking wing. In general, the gags were also not nearly as clever as those TISS. I admit, TISS did have the advantage of dry British wit, and as every American knows, nearly anything is ten times funnier when said with a British accent.  Still, most of the jokes in Guffman are of the Aren't these people ridiculous! variety -- which, again, doesn't work that well for me.  There were incipient ideas, like St. Clair's homosexual attraction to Savage, that could've led to sequences with greater levels of tension and, thus, comic possibility, if they had been developed further.  But instead, most of the humor is based on caricature, and although Guffman avoided smug superiority, it still failed to provide the kind of nuanced characterizations that would have engaged my sense of humor. To be fully honest, there were a few laughs in Guffman.  And it was much, much better than Drop Dead Gorgeous, which is one of the worst mockumentaries I've ever seen (and which suffers from a far more severe case of ironic detachment).  Still, I found it disappointing -- especially after having watched TISS so recently and being reminded of just how genuinely funny it was.

Then we have the travel agent couple, who are the perfect soccer mom/softball dad team of dorks. They can't really act either.  The casting was perfect, because they were not beautiful people (which Hollywood likes to use, even in casting films about people in small towns), just faces which could appeal to the characters they played.  And the comedy of it all is the play they put on at the end.  It's horrid and akward, like most of your high school plays. Most of all, these people actually believe they are moving on to bigger and better things, and this play is the ticket.  Not to be mean or nothing, but in all honesty, a play about Blaine Missouri will not be going to Broadway. It appeals to no one except the local community.  On top of this, the entertainment is sappy.  Thus, the revinue would be a complete disaster to the rest of the world if such a thing were to escape the bonds of this small town.

Broadway veteran (and I use the term loosely) Corky St. Clair (Guest) is in charge and his cast is a collection of folks that you'd easily recognize from any small town. But O'Hara, Willard, Posey and Levy make these folks so unaffectedly funny that you have to get a pillow to laugh into because you KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THIS! Just watching the Midnight at the Oasis audition of Willard and O'Hara (in their jogging suits) made me groan and laugh at the same time.I think one of my favorite scenes is when Corky goes to the Blaine city council and asks for more money for the show. It reminded me of my own small-town community (which is now much bigger) in which some of the most innocuous things in the world seem oh so important. And watching the eager audience file into the school auditorium reminded me so much of our little productions, right down to the popcorn stand in the lobby.As someone else has said, much of the humor here is subtle.

You gotta admit, the characters of Blaine MO sure love what they do, and find happiness in it, but that's part of the irony because they're SO clueless!  To wit (and probably my favorite line in the whole movie) Shiela Albertson (the GREAT Catherine O'Hara) praises her husband Ron's acting coaching, saying that he's tried to help me to change my instincts or at least to ignore them.  Any actor (Meisnerian, anyway) will tell you that this is completely backward from what you should do.The performances are all great  We've heard lots of kudos for the large roles, but even the small roles are portrayed brilliantly  Bob Balban as the Music Director, Michael Hitchcock as Councilman Steve Stark, etc.  If this were a REAL documentary, Errol Morris would have directed it!

The risk in any parody of acting is of course that the characters are overplayed, that is their acting becomes too hammy.  This in not the case with Guffman.While the whole cast gives strong performances, Christopher Guest shines as the camp and neurotic New York drop-out Corky St Clair. Corky (who was propelled to fame in the off-off-off-Braodway hit Backdraft - The Musical) is the thespian messiah who creates the masterwork musical, recalling the event packed history of the Stool Capital of America, Blain.The laughter from this film is heavily punctuated by cringing.  I think this film is as good as it is, not only because of its parody of small towns world-wide, but also because it plays on the audience's own fears and insecurities.  Anyone with an interest in movies, who is not an actor, has entertained the idea of acting themselves. The reoccurring, and often paralysing, fear is that you may be bad.really bad. Thought of trying out for your local community theatre, but were concerned about how it would turn out? This film will confirm for you that you should stay home.If this film has a weakness it's the performance of Catherine O'Hara as Sheila Albertson.

If I could sum it up in one word, it would be 'mild.' The story is mildly interesting, and it follows a group of small-town folks who are mildly quirky, putting on a play that is pretty bad, but only mildly funny.Part of the problem, I think, is that it's somewhat one-joke-- the characters are stupid, and they're putting on a bad play. Beyond that, there's not much to laugh at. There are a few moments of comedy, but most of it is just repeating the same ideas which aren't original or funny in the first place-- Fred Willard's character is self-obsessed and obnoxious, Catherine O'Hara is blindly supportive of him, Corky St. Clair is flamboyantly gay, etc. It seems cliché'd to compare this (or any improvisational comedy) to Spinal Tap, but the key difference between them is that in Spinal Tap, the characters say funny things. In this, the fact that the characters are stupid/vain/whatever is supposed to be the joke. And it gets old very quickly.Watching the film, it seems like the play is going to be a hilarious climax, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be. The songs themselves are pretty funny, because they're so cheesy and typical of amateur musical theater, but being subjected to 15+ minutes of the same joke -- these characters are bad actors and the lyrics are cheesy -- is tiresome.Also, I'm guessing the ending is supposed to be surprising, but it's telegraphed pretty clearly, and you can see it coming a mile away.

Almost 29% of the voters give Waiting For Guffman a 10 rating.

It is cute, it is well-done, it is funny in spots, but pales badly in direct comparison to the really fine films of recent years. I had seen this ensemble cast and writers/directors in Best In Show, and read all the reviews that compared it to This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting For Guffman. They also share the commonality of an improvised, amateur-looking film, almost like the new wave of making of extras on good DVDs. Like all their others, Guffman is just a silly fluff of entertainment.Blaine, Mo., The stool capital of the world, is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Temperamental, effeminate Corky (Chris Guest) aspires to Broadway and wrote a show, Red, White, and Blaine, and uses townspeople to present the musical.  Character development is done by a series of into-the-camera interviews with each. There is a series of amusing auditions, followed by some equally amusing rehearsals. They find out a NY producer is sending his man Mort Guffman to view the show, but he is not there as it starts. During the production, a stranger comes up and sits in Guffman's reserved seat. After, backstage, all are disappointed to find this is not Guffman, who was stranded in NYC because of a snowstorm. Later, they all leave Blaine, Corky ends up in NYC, others to Miami or LA in entertainment, and Parker Posey's character to a different DQ in Alabama. Guffman, as all their others, has what I will refer to as an anti-Mamet feel. David Mamet writes very specific, very snappy dialog. Rarely will one of his characters pause, stutter, or look undecided. The Guest/Levy films all have very hesitant, choppy, many times nonsensical dialog.  I like the Mamet style much more than the Guest/Levy style.

In Blaine, he's received much more recognition and opportunity than ever before, even if one of the primary reasons was for burning down a local theater during an over-ambitious stage production of Backdraft (1991). Waiting for Guffman is set during Blaine's sesquicentennial (150th Anniversary), and is the story of St. Clair conceiving, casting, producing and finally co-starring in a play that tells the story of Blaine.This is mockumentary (which means it's presented as if it were a documentary, but it's really just a satire of one) co-written, co-scored and directed by Guest, in the vein of his later work (the most recent as of this writing), A Mighty Wind (2003). While both films are likable enough, they both end up suffering from many of the same problems.Guest first rose to prominence as a writer and star of This Is Spinal Tap (1984), a hilarious mockumentary film directed by Rob Reiner. Most of Guest's work since Spinal Tap has been in the same vein. Unfortunately, none of it has been quite as funny.I'm not sure that Guest is trying to be as funny, though. Both Waiting for Guffman and A Mighty Wind often are far more serious than one might expect. It seems that Guest has a deep affection for small town life (and folk music in A Mighty Wind). He has one foot firmly in Garrison Keillor (of Prairie Home Companion/Lake Wobegon Days fame) territory. But material in that vein doesn't work nearly as well here as it does for Keillor.Keillor is crafting finely honed, mildly satirical, slightly quirky but ultimately heartwarming stories loaded with a deep sense of nostalgia for small town, family-oriented life. Guest is giving his actors a rough guide of the plot and letting them improvise for the camera. You can't improvise a Keillor-quality tale (not even Keillor could do it). So the final result is that occasionally the cast improvises something funny, but more often they are just working out their characters as they invent somewhat mundane facts and feelings about themselves. The funniest bits feature Guest's scripted material (facts about the history of the town, for example) or feature Guest himself on camera. It seems that there really was just something magical about Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer (who co-wrote the music here) improvising together and being directed by Reiner in This is Spinal Tap.It's not that the rest of the cast isn't good. I'm a fan of Eugene Levy (Guest's co-writer on the film), Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and other cast members. But they come across as far campier than Guest, and they're often in search of a punch line (as is Guest himself far too often during his improvised segments). I love camp, but I'm not sure it works when there isn't a fuller commitment to it, and it especially doesn't work when there's the attempt to venture into Keillor territory at the same time. The only other actor who really matches Guest in tone is Bob Balaban as the music teacher, but apparently Guest directed him to mostly look bewildered and slightly annoyed. He doesn't have many verbal punch lines, either.As it was in This is Spinal Tap and A Mighty Wind, the music in Waiting for Guffman is good. Guest, McKean and Shearer are obviously very talented musicians and songwriters in real life. But like in A Mighty Wind, the lyrics here are far less overtly spoof-oriented--there's nothing lyrically equivalent to Spinal Tap's Big Bottom. The result is that Waiting for Guffman could almost serve as a sample score for the trio to shop in order to acquire gigs scoring serious Broadway shows.Another factor that might turn some viewers off is that Guest seems to have struck upon a formula for his mockumentaries. We start with historical material about the performers and their cultural context, we see them developing their product, first tentatively, but later with more conviction and we see them attain an amount of public recognition and personal success. But somewhere along the way, personal problems begin creeping in and interfering with the success of the projects depicted in the film. People leave. People become disillusioned with at least some members of an organization. The success ends up being a bit hollow, and the cast disperses in the end, while we get a wrap-up showing where are they now, with many being back in the position they were in at the beginning of the film or worse. While the formula is enjoyable enough, and it certainly worked well for This is Spinal Tap, after the nth instantiation it becomes more difficult to have the same comic effect with it.Still, this probably sounds much more negative than it should. I did enjoy watching Waiting for Guffman overall. There were quite a few funny elements, and Guest does achieve a bit of the small town charm he's aiming for, including the faux theatrical performance. I just kept wishing that it could be even funnier, more outrageous, more unpredictable.

The artistic director is classic...as having been some big shot (not really) in NYC....he is trying to teach this community about professionalism in the industry. The audition scene is a scream and you will find yourself laughing out loud. When the final cast has been selected it couldn't be more of a motley crue.....and then the rehearsals start. You can watch this over and over and find yourself repeating the lines as they say them......a definite good time movie. The big show at the end is even crazier than the rest and they hope of someday bringing it to Broadway....hence waiting for Guffman...a big NY director to see their play. The character work is wonderful, truthful, and very appropriate. My vote for this classic is 9 out of 10.

Guest plays Corky St. Clair the town's resident stage director who is enlisted to mastermind the pageant. From auditions by the towns residents he selects travel agents Ron and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), dentist Dr. Allan Pearl (Eugene Levy), and Dairy Queen waitress Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey) as the cast for the play and begins to rehearse them. Eugene Levy and Fred Willard have never been funnier and Parker Posey is adorable. Christopher Guest makes Corky St. Clair a likable and totally believable character. The musical numbers are clever and very funny. Guest has directed and acted in other mockumentarys (Spinal Tap, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind) but Waiting for Guffman is one of the best.

Christopher Guest's mockumentary Waiting for Guffman is one of the funniest movies ever created. It's smart humor and devoted cast all give this picture what it needs to work. In the small town of Blaine Missouri, Corky St. Clair (Christopher Guest) is determined to get his play about the town's history off the ground. Using all the limited talent he has in the community, Corky puts on his production.The towns dentist Dr. Allen Pearl (Eugene Levy), travel agents Rob and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), and Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey), the local Dairy Queen employee, all team up to give Blaine it's tribute to a history OTC UFO's and making what put Blaine on the map, stools. While getting the show ready, they are informed of an important Broadway critic is going to come and review the show to see if it has any potential what so ever. This makes the cast excited, anxious, and just ready to give Blaine and the critic Mr. Guffman one hell of a performance. The dialogue between these characters is priceless. They unleash what could be some of the funniest scenes of cinema history such as when Corky tries to put modern dance into the play. What Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy have written is solid 24k gold. Guest's other mockumentaries are extremely well written as well, each with their own individual qualities. What Waiting for Guffman brings is comedy in it's roots...the stage.

But the joy is in the little traits of the characters, particularly the hilariously absurd interview scenes, and once they're all on screen together the momentum disappears. Having to follow a plot is clearly irritating for these gifted comedians, and the third-act surprise so obviously intended as the grand climax of the movie is tossed aside like so much used Kleenex. The film seems to just trail off in its final 30 minutes, straddling some invisible line between comedy and (strangely enough) poignancy, and the audience finds itself simply wanting the movie to end. Which it does, abruptly and unsatisfactorily. Morosely we shuffle out, disappointed.Still, the sheer joy of the first two acts is well worth the price of admission or rental, and there are far worse ways one could spend two hours. Recommended for anyone who's lived in a small town or is willing to laugh at absurdity. (Which usually go together.)

For most of this movie, the script was pure improv. Much of the story was scripted but the overall dialogue from the cast was made up on the spot. That alone makes Waiting for Guffman a comedy treat. The simple direction by Guest makes his movies character and story driven. The comedy comes from the original characters that are showcased in his movies. The audience finds itself laughing at the people or what the people say and do. There is no written punch line, instead, the characters end up making the audience laugh by being themselves. Even when it's not funny, it somehow becomes comedy. Be on the look out for an OK soda machine in the school's theater.

Although I think This is Spinal Tap is highly overrated, I think this film gets everything right. The humor is subtle, yet approachable at the same time. Christopher Guest plays Corky St. Clair, a supposedly heterosexual writer-director-actor of plays, although the believability of him having a wife named Bonnie is highly in question. Corky is from New York, but is now living in the small town of Blaine, Missouri, where they are having their 150'th anniversary. Corky is called on to put on a play to commerate the anniversary, and he recruits some of the eccentric citizens of the town to participate in the production. Some of those citizens include the local dentist, Dr. Allen Pearl (Eugene Levy), Ron and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), who are travel agents, but have never left Blaine, except for one time because of a medical condition, and Libby Mae Brown (Parker Posey), a girl that works at Diary Queen, who always seems to be sleepwalking.At first these actors seem very untalented, but throughout the film, we're very convinced that these people honestly try and have a passion for the theatre, and by the end, when we see the real production, the audience can definitely see an improvement. Done very realistically, documentary style (like Spinal Tap), Waiting for Guffman boasts a cast that also includes Guest regulars Bob Balaban, Michael Hitchcock, and Larry Miller. Guest is truly one of the better directors around today, and although he is not very well-known to the mainstream public, I think he is one of the biggest comedic geniuses working today (both in front of and behind the camera). Eugene Levy, seen in both good and bad movies, is also one of the funniest people in film, as is the improv talented Fred Willard, whose humor is by far the most subtle in the film. Catherine O'Hara and Parker Posey are also great, as always. If you liked Best in Show and A Mighty Wind, you'll surely like Waiting for Guffman, which I think is the best of the three. I can't say the same for This is Spinal Tap because I disliked that, but I love these three. Guest is by far a better director than Rob Reiner, whose biggest problem is he always ends up selling out in his films. Who knows how much better Spinal Tap could have been if Christopher Guest would have had directorial control.

It will most likely be compared more to Spinal Tap than Best in Show or A Mighty Wind because it was the first one. It has all most of Guest's posse including Michael Hitchcock, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Eugene Levy, and Bob Balaban. However, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean are nowhere to be seen.Guest is Corky St. Clair. He's a stage director who is hired to produce Blaine's sesquicentennial musical, `Red, White, and Blaine'. Some of his previous works include `Backdraft The Musical'. The theater burned down. The townspeople try out for the musical. They're horrible. Some include Dr. Allan Pearl (Levy), one of the only Jewish people in town, Ron and Sheila Albertson (Willard and O'Hara), and Libby Mae Brown (Posey), who enjoys her job at the local Dairy Queen. They all have to learn their roles with the demanding Corky, and the whole thing is shot in documentary form.First things first if you don't like documentaries, you won't like this picture. Although it isn't true, the whole movie is very talky and doesn't have any action. If you enjoy quirky pictures that can be uneven but also funny, this is your type of movie. It has many funny moments, especially from Corky (`You people.are.bastard people!'). At times, I'm sure what the actors had to go through was embarrassing, especially when Willard and O'Hara were doing their duet. A way that that was put into perspective for me was when our school put on a performance of `Bye Bye Birdie', and the person who played Gloria Rasputin, a glitzy dancer who is not very good, commented how embarrassing it was to be bad.The photography was amateurish, especially in the beginning, but that gave it a more authentic feel to the documentary-type it is. However, if this is all supposed to be a documentary, then there are a few shots that don't seem right. The townspeople are knocking on Corky's door, and then we see Corky sitting in the bathtub. Also, right after scene was done in the musical; we follow the actors going backstage. If the camera was just in the audience, how can it get on stage?Much of the dialogue was obviously improvised, and it tells. Whenever someone just got a whiff, they went on to talk about whatever, and it's often very funny. Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD are just improv, especially from Fred Willard, who is just hilarious.Something that makes this different from other movies is that there is no background music, because this is supposed to be a documentary. It really put more of an authentic feel. Another point that I loved is the combination of a regular movie and an ensemble movie. Instead of having some well-developed characters or no characters to care about, Guest put in deep characters, that have back-stories that we actually care about, and it's amazing that he can put all of it in in 80 minutes. Waiting for Guffman is a very funny piece that isn't as much about the bad actors but the interesting story that goes on behind the scenes.My rating 8/10Rated R for brief strong language.

I loved this movie for two reasons, 1) It was done by my favorite comedy troupe, and 2) I am in many productions in community theater, so I kind of related to this in a close way. First of all, not all community theaters do plays this bad, hardly any of them do. This is kind of an a stretch, but it is still funny. Some community theaters put on productions that rival Broadway productions (in my opinion). But this is just so funny, it will make you cry. I think this is just such an excellent film, and gets funnier everytime I watch it. The best things about Guest's films are, no matter how many times you watch them they don't get boring or less funny like most of the Farrely Brothers films. The thing I truly admire of Guest is he doensn't have to use too many raunchy jokes to make the best comedy films. The only reason this film got unfairly slapped with an 'R' rating is because it has the f-word twice. The film 'So I Married An Axe Murderer' starring Mike Myers, features that word three times, and got a 'PG-13' rating.

I recommend, if you haven't already, seeing the deleted scenes from this.  I cannot understand how they left these out of the movie.

Unlike Mamet (in this film at least) he seems incapable of realising when to stop milking an idea that is only mildly funny at best. Waiting for Guffman is a ten-minute short that somehow became inflated into a cliched, irritating and even slightly patronising pseudo-documentary about non-actors getting it together to 'put on a show'. All the stock characters are here, the failed gay theatre-maven from the big smoke, the dreamy fast-food girl waiting to be discovered, the nerd, the ex all-American footballer with a dark secret. What Guest and Levy don't seem to appreciate is that they have fallen into exactly the same mind-set as their would-be Broadway cast. It's nowhere near as funny or relevant to those who aren't directly involved. The stage production itself is so interminably long and irritating it made me want to scream (I was watching in the presence of a good friend who was keen for me to see it) and on another level was even rather perverse - were we as an audience expected to derive pleasure from the failure and naive, energetic non-talent of others?  Overall I am happy to see that Guest et al have redeemed themselves with the clever Best In Show (which I saw first) Poking fun at amateur theatricals may seem like an easy target, but Waiting for Guffman is a flabby, self-satisfied and strained entertainment that might be considered 'subtle' by some, but anaemic and tiresomely padded by the majority. 3 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Predisposition, maybe?","Date":"12 January 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"     Those who like this horrid film will never understand those of us who wait for Waiting for Guffman to end.

Corky accepts and begins casting.  He casts the ego-driven Ron and Shelia Albertson, the Dari Queen waitress Libby Mae Brown, and a dentist, Dr. Allen Pearl. All these people, including Corky, have no talent and they don't know it. They rehearse for weeks and then one day a letter arrives saying that Mort Guffman will attend their show.

Of course, their founder was on his way to the Pacific Ocean, when he announced to the group of pioneers that they were in fact there. Did I mention, Blaine is in Missouri? Of course, like their founder, the town is far from exceptional also. The local acting group is planning a play, which will celebrate the many historic events that have taken place in Blaine's past. Of course, this being a small town in Middle America, standards of performances are somewhat less than what you might see in say, New York or LA. The town turns to the great Corky St. Claire to write, star and produce the show. Corky is the super talented (legend in his own mind), somewhat odd fellow, that produces all of the town's plays. Oscar Wilde only dreamed of being as alternative as Corky is. Of course, Corky will need help in making this epic play work, so he turns to his trusted core of locals for acting talent. Of course, when it is discovered that a broadway agent will be appearing at the town play, well, let's just say that the importance of the performance goes way up. Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy and all of the rest of the cast are just incredible. You will laugh out loud the whole way. The movie does have real emotion, but it is a comedy, first and foremost. **** out of ****. By the way, this is the same group that did Best in Show.

By turns funny and poignant, the talented cast takes us from auditions through performance of a musicale celebrating the anniversary of the founding of Blaine, Missouri, The Stool Capital of America. The production is the brainchild of one Corky Sinclair, a transplant from the Big Apple who sees the production as a possible ticket back to the Great White Way. He overcomes all sorts of hurdles, from finances to last-minute cast changes with melodrama and devotion, and gives Blaine an extravaganza the citizens of Blaine will never forget. The satire is always on target but never mean-spirited, and nowadays that is a real achievement. I have watched this several times and each time I have found a new comic gem.

Christopher Guest (along with Eugene Levy and Michael McKeon) has crafted one of the most hilarious scripts imaginable. The characters are so good at being so serious and believing in everything that they do.  They think their lives in Blaine (with 5 letters in it), Missouri and their takes on acting are so important. It's so much fun to watch Libby Mae, Ron & Sheila, Dr. Pearl and of course, Corky talk about themselves and their everyday lives at the beginning of the mockumentary.  Libby describing her Dairy Queen gig Lots of people come into the DQ... burgers... cokes... Get a coke... just drive in and get a coke if you're thirsty. or Corky talking about job prospects in Blaine You know, one of those construction workers with the hat... you know the sweeping hard hat.  It's all so inane and so, SO funny!I will admit that this movie appeals much more to anyone who's done theatre, particularly community theatre.  The acting (or attempts at), the lines from the show, the auditions, the musical director who shops at Wal-Mart- everyone in theatre has seen or met someone like each of these characters. However, if you grew up in a small town like Blaine that had annual or periodical town celebrations, there are plenty of jokes that you'll get that others might miss.Christopher Guest is so fabulous at being the overly stereotypical gay off-off-off-off-off Broadway director, Corky St. Clair, who came off a navy ship in New York with a tube of chapstick and a dance belt to his name. He is such a talented actor and is great at covering his character's overly emotional personality.The supporting ensemble is great too, particularly Eugene Levy, Parker Posey and Catherine O'Hara.  Libby Mae's (Posey) audition piece is fabulous, as is Ron & Sheila's Midnight at the Oasis.  The songs in the movie are original (as with Spinal Tap which was made by several of the writers and actors here) and classic.  It takes several viewings to pick up on some of the lines in them, but they're so Corky/Christopher Guest, Levy and McKeon. Nothing ever happens on Mars is my personal favorite and the line You sit around, you sit some more/On the planet named for the Roman god of war.I would recommend watching this movie several times (like so many other people did) because if it isn't one thing, it's another hilarious moment that you missed the first time around.  It's one that my parents and I watch either together or by ourselves whenever we're having a bad day and want to laugh at the silliness of Corky and Company.

It's easy to say that Guest's original mockumentary This is Spinal Tap is a good litmus test for Potential Guffman Fanatics, but I think that in order to be able to enjoy Spinal Tap to it's fullest deserved potential, one almost has to be a rock musician him/herself.

Same mockumentary style, new cast of characters.  (The music and lyrics are written Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, Chrisopher Guest - of Spinal Tap fame)  I think the key to Waiting for Guffman's word-of-mouth success is the style of comedy.  The humor is often subtle, and when you begin to notice some of the less-obvious mannerisms of the characters, you feel like you're in on the joke.  It worked the same way with Spinal Tap.  The action is often away from the person who's at the center of the scene (like Catherine O'Hara mouthing Fred Willard's lines while they're auditioning).

I was instantly sold! I had already read about the film in Newsweek and the New York Times, and knew somewhat what to expect from the film. The film's director/star/co-writer Christopher Guest had made an impression on me as Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel; on Saturday Night Live (during the 1984-85 season); and in the film The Princess Bride, in which he plays Count Rugen, the sadistic villain with six fingers on one hand. Co-star/co-writer Eugene Levy was a favorite of mine from SCTV (as Bobby Bittman, Sid Dithers and Stan Schmenge, among others) and he played memorable roles in Splash, Club Paradise and Multiplicity. And the rest of the cast possess equally amusing and impressive resumes.WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is a mockumentary in the tradition of Spinal Tap, mostly improvised by the talented ensemble of performers, shot in a faux-documentary style, and telling the story of an untalented group of thespians who fumble through an unmemorable musical play based on the history of their hometown, the fictional Blaine, Missouri, which is celebrating its sesqacentennial (150th aniversary).For fans of comedy, the film is a simplistic, silly gem of a story, with some viciously memorable lines (We're bi-coastal....that is if you consider the Mississippi River one of the coasts.) which soon incorporate themselves into your everyday vernacular, much like the dialogue from films like Caddyshack, Stripes and Star Wars.

The only thing is that Guest never goes the extra step to make these characters anything more than hysterical and it's there for the taking.Guffman centers around a fictional Missouri town called Blaine in which a local theater director Corky St. Clair (Guest) has agreed to create and direct a show about the history of the town for its 150th anniversary celebration. The film goes through the whole process by interviewing everyone involved and following St. Clair as it all happens. When they hear that a Broadway scout of sorts named Mort Guffman is to attend their performance, they all get incredibly excited.Guest and his usual cast of actors playing yet another set of actors are great once again in this film. Eugene Levy is great as the town's dentist who discovers his theatrical side when he's cast in the show. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara continue to apply their off-beat senses of humor to their roles as a husband and wife that run a travel agency despite never having left Blaine in their lives. Parker Posey also demonstrates a great subtle humor to her part as a young Dairy Queen employee.The greatest statement that Guest makes with this film is that it's completely absurd that these people expect their lives to become anything more than dull. You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it.

Thirty minutes into it I thought I might turn it off, but I trekked on to see if it picked up. It didn't. I have no problem with mocumentaries, and actually enjoy quite many of them, but this one just fell flat on it's face. All it is, is annoying people being annoying.

Maybe some of this can be attributed to the fact that I was expecting more of a film and less of a mocumentary. It's format, even for mocks, became quite tedious. There were too many interviews. The film's major flaw is that it takes what might be slightly funny in the beginning and just repeats it into infinity. If you've seen the first 20 minutes, you've seen the entire film. It's not that it's not funny, it's just not funny enough.I will admit though, even if I didn't enjoy it, it's amazing to think that a movie can be made with literally no script and all improvisation.

It's got quirky written all over the place, but it's always endearing in it's very strange way to show these people as they are, and the characters are likable even at their most deranged and just, well, 'small-town'.Guest plays the director of a small-town's 150th anniversary memorial play, about how a town in Missouri came to be. It's a chance really to get glimpses into the people who get the chance of a lifetime (err, for seemingly their mundane lifetimes), and especially for Corky who gives prima-donna an odd name; he almost storms off when he doesn't get the money he asks the committee for (calling them 'bastards' in an angry burst that's one of the funniest things I've ever seen from Guest in anything he's done). Then comes crunch-time for the show, as Corky has to take a part himself and Alan Pearl has to convincingly play a part he has absolutely no confidence at (those glasses!). And all the while, the 'Guffman' of the title- ala Godot- is a near God-like figure who could make or break the perception of the production for Corky and his cast. The final revelation from this is a comic classic touch.This all being said, I didn't really get the great big belly laughs and get as sucked into the world of these oddballs (and all done in improvisational form no less) as I did with the other films that have the mark of Guest and/or Levy. There are some parts where I'll smile at the near whimsy of what's going on, but a line might go flat or a bit a little weak. But if it's ever on TV, I'm sure I would tune in again just for a little while, if only to see a few of the songs from the 150th anniversary show (the 'Mars' song a favorite), and for that great epilogue.

So I decided to keep an open mind, and give it a second viewing.  I have to say, I liked it a LITTLE better this time around, but I still found it no more than mediocre.  There were some funny sequences--OK, I have to admit the idea of Backdraft  The Musical was pretty damn funny--but most of the humor just went right through me.  I like improvisational comedy, if it's done right.  I love Whose Line is it Anyway?  Improv can be used for dynamic purposes.  In this case, it wasn't.

Whatever it is, it's not too interesting--to me at least.  There are some comedies I watch where I think to myself, This is completely stupid, but at least I know when the film is trying to go for laughs and where the punchlines are, and I know that there's a possibility that someone on Earth might find it funny.  In Waiting for Guffman the punchlines seemed to be non-existent--or maybe hidden.  The cast is, undoubtedly, great.  And that makes it more pitiful.  Talented performers like Fred Willard, Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and others deserve much better.  I'm glad the general public found great amusement in this movie, but I didn't.

You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was.The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film.Overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like I Love Lucy or Hee-Haw.But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor.

I watched Waiting For Guffman two nights ago, and this morning driving to work I literally burst out laughing as I remembered the highlights of the film. True enough, I was also laughing while I watched it, but certain situations and one-liners take time to fully register how ridiculous they are. What's not said or shown is often with Guest as funny as what is shown. It just takes a little while for you to form your own mental images of these implausible situations! The obvious example is the absolutely wonderful Fred Willard dropping his trousers in the restaurant. On one level it's an obvious joke, but when you stop and think about (a) how carefully the gag has been set up over the preceding scenes (we know he has had an embarrassing operation); (b) the gusto with which Fred seems to relish crossing the bounds of acceptable taste; and (c) Fred's character Ron's dumb premise that just because Dr Pearl is a dentist (a medical man), he would be interested in looking at his manhood! There's a sort of flawed logic in there somewhere, and that's what makes it so funny, trying to imagine how Ron arrived at this frame of mind (eg the infamous wedding night when Sheila cried so much).Another thing that made me stop and think was the character of Corky. I can see why at first glance he can seem like an annoying gay stereotype. But good ol' Christopher Guest has a trick up his sleeve...listen VERY carefully and you'll hear him mention his wife (just once in the whole movie). I don't actually think for a minute Corky is homosexual, he just acts exceedingly camp. Most people have the same reaction Johnny Savage's Dad has...which probably says something about us, the viewer, and our eagerness to jump to conclusions. We should realise that Christopher Guest is one step ahead of us!Top performance of the movie for me goes to Fred Willard, as always in these ensemble pieces, every second he is on screen he just makes me roll around on the floor in hysterics. By his usual standards he is relatively subdued here, but those familiar lowest-common-denominator comments and so-unfunny-they're-funny wisecracks are all still here in abundance. The scene where Ron and Sheila are working as extras and Ron just will not shut up is priceless - pure Willard genius.Everyone else is well up to par Parker Posey is gorgeous yet a little scary as Libby the Dairy Queen girl. Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Bob Babalan et al..they all gel so well together as a unit and spark so instinctively off each other. Talking of instinct, that comment about Ron teaching Sheila to ignore her instinct...the mind boggles! I mean, just try and imagine that (unshown) scene for a minute. Imagine an actor trying to play a character WITHOUT using their instinct! Can you think of a worse piece of advice? Where on earth did Ron get this ridiculous theory about acting from?! I suspect it's the polar opposite of what Mr Guest encourages his cast to do.I've only seen this once, compared to multiple viewings of the other Guest movies. They have all made a really made a big impression on me. If you want intelligent dialogue, strong emotions and real deep belly laughs, then watch Waiting For Guffman!

Ronnie,Run!,but actually,that distinction may belong in truth to This is Spinal Tap,which is,in turn where Guest cut his teeth in terms of straight-playing,improvisational tour-guiding of viewers through fictional and laughable real people and situations. Still,it feels like this movie practically made the improvised(and not improvised)sense of taking the viewer through supposedly unforced and natural parody seem natural,effortless and brilliant.The small,central(?) Missouri town of Blaine is(As of 1995-96) turning 150 years old,and for something special to commemorate the sesquicentennial of Founder's Day,one-time Broadway actor and choreographer Corky St.Clair(Guest,relishing this chance to shed his more bankable notice from such films as Spinal and Princess Bride)decides to seize this opportunity and put on a big-scale,Broadway quality musical celebrating the town's quaint yet odd history. He hires a composer--a quietly resentful music teacher(Bob Balaban,masterfully non-descript and intelligent,quietly funny)--and goes about assembling a cast. After sitting through an audition casting call that can be politely described as Unique(examples a caped stunt player and a man who fires ping pong balls and catches them,both by mouth),he is able to make his castDr.Allan Pearl(Eugene Levy,who is a joy to watch in almost everything he does) a shy,modestly talented but game dentist with vision problems;Ron and Sheila Albertson(Fred Willard--who would belong in a HAll of FAme of comedic character actors--and CAtherine OHAra,who along with Levy,is a Ace SCTV alum who NEEDS more projects like this),local travel agents,also semi-talented and both quite delusional; Libby MAe Brown(Parker Posey,somewhat out-of-the-norm for her here,IF there's a norm for her types of roles),a basically unspoiled Dairy Queen employee,also with limited stage talent but game for the challenge;Johnny SAvage(MAtt Keeslar),a handsome but perceivably dense auto mechanic who goes along for the show,regardless of how much he may really fit in;and local storyteller Clifford Wooley(Lewis Arquette,more famous for being a member of the acting family),who serves as the narrator for their production. As Corky assembles the talent on hand,rehearses and tries to get the show up, he runs into his share of roadblocks(lack of funding,cast availability,potential nervous breakdowns,etc.)as he gets word(perhaps solicited)that a major Broadway talent scout named Mort Guffman(hence the title)may be on his way to view the show,presenting the chance for Corky to return to his beloved New York and possibly a chance for Stars to be Born,so to speak.Co-written by Levy,this movie leaves the punchlines,situations and pratfalls--verbal AND physical--to be caught by the audience,never overdoing anything and always rolling the situation along. BArely ninety minutes long,the movie figures--and rightly so--that if you missed something and were at all interested in what you saw that you'd want to watch it again,perhaps multiple times. These are all qualities that,while I realize in major motion pictures is going to be somewhat rare,I LOVE to see employed. Being someone who has dabbled in local theater,I can say that there are some rather universal elements in the look,feel and ambitions of putting on the show and making sure the Show must Go on! that make this movie distinctive and great. Whether it's a simple Summer Stock production or a MAssive,Major Broadway production,there's always this idea that the stage is somewhere where talent is raw and unpredictable,tough to corral and always rife with potential to go wrong. Besides the previous film qualities I've mentioned,this film also captures the sense of making theatre(And it really,let's be honest,wouldn't be so funny if the talent assembled here WASN'T sub-par),which can easily be very UN-entertaining,and makes it funny and raw.A keeper of a movie,and a good teaser or compliment to the other Guest-Levy penned films made from thence forward.

We are meant to find it funny how badly these actors really are on stage, but we've actually seen them improve from their rehearsals, and they only seem like what they are, passionate amateurs. In that light, it seems cruel the film concludes with not one but two hard stops. In the first one, we see their big audition for a New York agent is not what they hoped in a painful, drawn-out, unfunny scene. Later, we discover the acting bug has infected all the players in a decidedly unfortunate way. Dr. Pearl leaves his wife to perform in old-age homes. Ron and Sheila are extras in commercials. Libby Mae now works at a Dairy Queen in Sipes, Alabama. SPOILER ENDS.So I laugh watching this movie. It's funny. But it's cold and mean, too, and the laughs feel hollow. I'd like it more if it retained the spirit of the first half, and some of the same feeling of positivism that makes another film about non-talents, Ed Wood, a true joy.BTW - A great thing about the DVD is the chance to see Parker Posey's Libby Mae perform her acting audition, a scene from what seems to be Tennessee Williams' treatment of Flowers In The Attic. It's mindbendingly hilarious, easily the best thing in the film, used or not. Who's on top, and who's on bottom now? I'll see you in hell, Billy, but I'm gonna have some fun before I go!
