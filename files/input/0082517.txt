History Of The World is a funny film, but it is not one of his best films. It looks like it was based on bits and pieces of ideas that could have been built up into separate movies a film about the stone age, a film about the Roman Empire, a film about the French Revolution. I am sure that Brooks was inventive enough to have created three film spoofs, but for some reason he decided to just concentrate on pasting these mini-spoofs together.It has wonderful moments in it - some are thrown away. The four desperate refugees from the Roman Empire, followed by centurions, pray for a miracle. Suddenly they see an old man - Brooks dressed like Moses (from an earlier sequence in the film). A river is parted like the Red Sea with Moses arms in the air. The refugees flee thanking God and Moses. In a moment we see there is a robber in back of Moses holding him up (hence his arms in the air), and when the robber leaves the old man starts cursing him.Similar stuff is throughout the film (typical of Brooks' inventiveness). After fleeing Rome, Brooks has reached Palestine and is the waiter serving the Last Supper. Besides having a problem when he keeps saying JEEZUS causing John Hurt (who is Christ) to ask, Yes?, there is the problem of the painting being done by Da Vinci (Art Metrano), and how Brooks manages to get into the background of the masterpiece - holding his tray like a halo behind Hurt).Brooks uses a number of his regulars in the film Madeline Kahn as the Empress Nympho, Dom DeLuis as the Emperor (one could call him piggy after one particular comment about his eating habits), Harvey Korman as the foppish Count du Monet, Sid Caesar as a caveman who is full of awe. He was also lucky to have Gregory Hines, usually a dancer but here a strikingly breezy comic, and Orson Welles doing the narration properly (note his voice's confusion at the start when describing the first heterosexual marriage, followed by the first homosexual one).The disjointed style is a minor problem in enjoying the film. Judging from the final scenes from the sequel, Brooks could have done a Viking movie, a skating film about Nazism, and a space musical about the Jews. Alas, only those scenes were ever shot. A second part might not have been a great film either, but it would have been quite as amusing.

It is wildly uneven but, also, undeniably funny at times (even if most of the gags are, unsurprisingly, of the vulgar kind).Brooks managed to rope in Orson Welles to provide indifferent narration over his lampoon of various historical eras (the film's one-liners, too, read better than they play). Still, The Stone Age (featuring Sid Caesar) offers a nice parody of the Dawn Of Man sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) &#150; while the brief but hilarious The Old Testament sees Brooks himself as Moses accidentally lose a third of God's original 15 Commandments! The Roman Empire &#150; the longest segment &#150; features Brooks veterans Dom De Luise and Madeleine Kahn, the film's single best joke (the Senators' spontaneous reply, in unison, to a fellow members' concern over the plight of the city's poor), plus wonderful conclusion involving John Hurt as Jesus Christ. The Spanish Inquistion is, again, brief but surely one of the film's highlights with its tastelessly inspired depiction of this infamous period as a Busby Berkeley-ish production number (though Brooks' typical Jewish jokes seem baffling in this context). Just as Monty Python had done the definitive parody of the Roman Empire with LIFE OF BRIAN (1979), The French Revolution follows on from the Carry On gang's DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD (1966). The results are just as middling (involving the inevitable impersonation of the King by a commoner) &#150; but highlighting two established presences in Brooks' films, Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. Easily the funniest bit from this segment is the King's outrageous shooting practice.Still, at the end of the day, Brooks can't avoid repeating himself the Walk This Way gag from YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (1974) turns up here as well; Brooks' lecherous French king is virtually a copy of his Governor characterization in the Western spoof BLAZING SADDLES (1974); and the surreal nick-of-time escape at the very end, which also derives from the latter film.

While it starts out with the promising Orson Welles voice-over (spoofing his own War of the Worlds narration as a nifty in-joke) in the first segment (which also spoofs the ape men sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey), the rest quickly plummets in one un-funny after un-funny succession.Sid Caesar gives all he has for his short bit as the lead caveman (and granted, the entry works). Moses fails to deliver and whatever comic intent there is shatters just like his extra table of commandments. Only the Bea Arthur scene works in the Roman Empire segment -- even Madeline Kahn's presence can't save what is a badly written part -- and here the movie completely sinks into incoherence with unrelated funny scenes added as supposed hilarity, for example, when a man carries a very dated boom box and listens to Funkytown. The Last Supper sequence is fairly descent and somewhat brings back History... a little luster, but the Spanish Inquisition, a segment obviously intended as a nod to Hollywood musicals from the 1930s, is quite arguably the worst sketch in the entire movie. The French Revolution begins well, bringing Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, and Andreas Katsoulas, all Brooks veterans, back on film in small but memorable parts, but not long after this segment begins that it goes down, down under and never bothers to recover itself. The fact that Mel Brooks also decided to play five roles here makes it the more irritating. One can only guess he did so due to his own star power (or maybe he believed he could do an Alec Guiness). His entry as the King in the last sequence is so cringe-inducing It's good to be the king! that it's a relief when that bad joke is over and THE END appears on the horizon with a title montage reminiscent of the all-caps title LAND OF THE GIANTS.I personally am glad of his success with his own revival of The Producers. His recent appearance at the season finale of Curb Your Enthusiasm only cements his reputation even more as he spoofs his revival using Larry David, of all people as the lead, in order for it to flop. It only furthers to show he can make a fantastically funny visual story (or appear in one) when he chooses to, but this movie is only for die-hard fans.

Mel Brooks delivers a critique of today's religion and politics but with characters and situations set ages ago. After all, the proverbial question set by characters from thousands of years ago, But what about the poor? The F Word reply given in unison by the chorus of ancient politicians was really a social commentary on contemporary politics. Mel Brooks' musical extravaganza on The Inquisition was not just a commentary of a dark, violent, regrettable page of history on the Catholic Church, but a commentary on a few aspects of today's religious issues. Some people in the audience may have felt that some of the religious humor was too disrespectful, with characters in the scenes like Moses, Jesus, priests, nuns, etc. The rule of thumb on that is that you can have Biblical and religious characters in your humor, as long as you're making fun with them, rather than at them. After all, when was the last time you thought about God? Anytime people start talking and thinking about religion, their beliefs or disbeliefs, it's good. It's thought provoking. It would be too in your face to use contemporary public figures to make commentary like that. After all, this is a Mel Brooks motion picture for the movie theater where you pay for a ticket and expect quality -- not an episode of Saturday Night Live that keeps recycling old jokes with new faces. That's why it's good taste to make your comedic critique with characters and situations set hundreds or thousands of years ago as Mel Brooks did in the first place.

In contrast, Mel's vaudavillian style burlesque humour may have been too old fashioned (despite the littering of swear words and dirty jokes). However, I'm afraid there is only one real reason this filmed failed to make any money. It wasn't funny. Attacking history with his shop worn comic shtick may have been too great a task. Also, Mel is credited as writing, producing and directing this picture single handedly. Perhaps he spread himself too thin this time. The film gets off to a funny enough start with a lampooning of Kubrick's ultra dull epic 2001 A Space Odessy by having a load of primates masterbating. We are then given a narrated documentary of stone age man. There are some gags, but nothing great. Then there is a wonderfull Brooks moment as he plays Moses, dropping one of the stone tablets with the 15 commandments on it. Then there is a long sketch about the Roman Empire and things get deeply dull. Despite Madline Khan, this section has few laughs. If there were any, the atmosphere is murdered by a repulsive performance by the ever unfunny Dom De Luise. Never funny, but here he manages to be stomach churningly awful. Because you can see it in his eyes. He THINKS HE'S FUNNY!!!! The Spanish Inquisition suffers for the same reason. Mel is in the full grip of meglomaniac narcasism. You think he's parodying big show tunes and dance numbers with that cheesy grin? He's trying not to laugh at his own comic genious, leaving the rest of the audience out of the joke. On the plus side we get a hysterically funny snippet of two imprisoned Jews relating their woes in the form of song. The French Revolution segmant is the most consistantly funny. Harvey Korman makes a brilliant appearance with a great character name. There are a load of great gags. You get the impression that the cast, including Brooks, have finally got the balance needed to make the oddball script work. The legendary Spike Milligan upstages Brooks with his small role in the film. Mel, however, is in much better form and as the film comes to an end some will feel not totally cheated. There is a trailer for the film's sequal with probably the best gags.The film is episodic, which is fine.

My personal feeling is that HISTORY OF THE WORLD-PART 1 succeeds as being so hilarious due to the fact that it is so incredibly crude. It's a miracle that it gets shown on TV (even in a censored version). I own the book written by Mel Brooks in 1981. It is a telling of the movie complete with MANY photographs taken from the film. Sometimes, I think that the film gets mean-spirited, and that is when it isn't funny anymore.  Mel Brooks is the undisputed comedy genius of the latter half of this century. Without a doubt, he has made more people laugh than any one else. His comedy is unique because while it is in bad taste, he somehow makes us feel good. Even in his first film, he makes us laugh at something in bad taste. This is where he is different from other, run-of-the-mill comics like Adam Sandler or Eddie Murphy, or SNL or anything like that- because Brooks' really knows what is funny. From his earliest effort to his latest, he remains a genius. But as for HISTORY OF THE WORLD. It seems to be his most popular movie with today's generation. BLAZING SADDLES is still popular, though. Of course, THE PRODUCERS, THE TWELVE CHAIRS, SILENT MOVIE, HIGH ANXIETY, TO BE OR NOT TO BE, and LIFE STINKS were all aimed at older audiences, his films like BLAZING SADDLES,YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, HISTORY OF THE WORLD, SPACEBALLS, ROBIN HOOD MEN IN TIGHTS and DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT will always be popular with the younger audiences.

Watch it today - devoid of such high expectations - and you know what? It's still weak.An overview of history from caveman days to the French Revolution, History Of The World Part 1 introduces us to such characters as Moses, Comicus the Roman stand-up philosopher, and King Louis XVI, all played by Brooks' favorite actor - Mel himself. In various bits, we see man emerge from erotically fixated primitives to erotically fixated primitives with silly wigs.History Of The World is really two mini-movies, one about Comicus the Roman and the other a Tale Of Two Cities parody of the French Revolution in which King Louis is replaced by a lowly lookalike, played of course by Mel. A few other bits are thrown around in the way of padded one-liners, but it's really more like Brooks couldn't be bothered with shooting a full-length movie this time. The French one at least is funny in parts, but much of what shows up on screen seems too thin for a story conference, let alone a movie.And the jokes! Puerile third-grade schoolyard stuff. In the year 1,000,000 BC, it is thought the first homo sapien marriage occurred, intones Orson Welles as we watch caveman Sid Caesar club a woman over the head. It was shortly followed by the first homosexual marriage. The Rome segment is just bizarre, with pointless cameos from Hugh Hefner and Henny Youngman and a long joke involving a chariot with a giant reefer.I believe Brooks' gradual decline as a filmmaker had to do with his increased focus on himself as central presence, and he really makes a case for it here. Why, in a film co-starring one of the great song-and-dance men of his generation, Gregory Hines, do you have the one big song-and-dance number star Mel Brooks?At least the French segment works somewhat in the classic Brooks vein, with some familiar faces from his other movies getting some quality time like Harvey Korman, Andreas Voutsinas, and Cloris Leachman, in the last of her Brooks crone roles as bitter Madame Defarge We are so poor, we don't even have a language, just a stupid accent!It's also the segment that delivers the best lines. It's good to be the king is what Louis says after molesting various ladies of the court, and Brooks is just right for the part there, probably because he WAS the king on the set and knew what he was talking about. Korman's Wait for the shake is also a favorite of mine, right up there with Walk this way and Where the white women at? from past Brooks' classics.But why Mel thought a chess gangbang would be so funny is lost on me, as is the comedy potential of a burping Dom DeLuise, or Jews being tortured by nuns in bathing suits. Call it hubris, but the sad fact was, for its many faults, History would be the last Brooks comedy that got within shouting distance of his Blazing Saddles peak. He could have just have easily subtitled this Decline And Fall.

A shot of a street in ancient Rome has a black guy walking along with a boombox against his ear. Ha ha. Facing the guillotine, Brooks is asked if he has any last requests. Yes -- NOVACAINE! It hasn't been invented yet. I'll wait! And Brooks from time to time glances at the camera and makes comments on the shenanigans.A lot of the humor is Jewish. During a parody of Esther Williams' movies we not only see seven girls in bathing suits (and caps) slowly emerge from the pool wearing sparklers on their heads, but as they go up and up we see that they're standing on a menorah. A drowning man shouts and the underwater bubble of his breath rises to the surface and pops and it says, Oy, gewalt! Maybe I should quit because otherwise I'll give away all the gags and some of them depend on the principle of fundamental surprise. Many of them also depend on vulgarity, in more than one language. It's about as politically correct as you can get. I don't know that even in a good-natured comedy that skewers politicians, racism, Judaism, Hollywood, and Holy Mother Church you could get away with calling someone a fag today. Or how about this. Gregory Hines' intact heterosexuality is revealed and someone shouts, The jig is up! And gone, exclaims Hines, diving out the window.For me the scene that works best is the one in which Brooks is Louis XVI, shooting down peasants as they are flung through the air like clay pigeons. He's in a ridiculous King costume and wears a villainous black mustache and a beauty spot. Strolling through the garden, he gooses Marie Antoinette, winks at the camera and says, It's good to be da king. And when he's forcing a beautiful blond virgin to meet him later that night, in order to save her imprisoned father, he adopts this smug, conspiratorial tone as he tells her, You do it. You KNOW you do it. You WANNA do it. We all do it. And he smiles wickedly at us and reminds us again that, It's good to be da king. I said this was a good-natured comedy and what I mean is that it doesn't depend in any way on anger. There isn't even an undertone of nastiness. We see a sketch from what we used to call coming attractions -- Hitler on Ice -- and Hitler performs gracefully. The humor lies in the absurdity of the concept. Any value judgments about the subject are taken for granted.Some of it looks quite a bit like Woody Allen, but it may be a case of independent invention. What it reminds me of at times are the Road films of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. Now THAT'S good-natured comedy, although Brooks idea of fun is of course more urban, if not more urbane.The bloated pompous baritone of Orson Welles introduces each new segment with portentous comments -- The first weapon was the spear. Welles, like Brooks, is obviously kidding around too. Everybody is kidding around and the result is quite a lot of fun, despite the occasional wince.

There are only a few groaners, a few eye raisers and many genuine laughs, a few of them worthy of a Danny Thomas spit take.Utilizing humor styles perfected the year earlier with Airplane! while utilizing his familiar style of delicious bad taste, Brooks uses much of his regular crew of funny people. With dry narration by Orson Welles, Brooks goes all out to satirize the genre of phony Hollywood history. The highlights are the Roman Empire sequence with a delightfully hysterical performance by Madeline Kahn as an unnamed Roman empress, with a deliberately grotesque performance by Dom De Luise as the Emperor. Historical timing would show it as Tiberious as the scene moved to Judea on the night of the last supper. Ironically, John Hurt who played Caligula in TV's I Claudius plays Jesus in a cameo.The inquisition sequence is a parody just like Springtime For Hitler to show the atrocities against the Jewish population. It is semi- successful as long as you realize the point Brooks was making and the real history behind it.Some great art direction makes the French Revolution sequence better than it actually is although the cameos by several familiar faces is also of help. With Cloris Leachman standing out as the Dickens character Madam De Farce, that segment is raised a notch, just as the Roman Empire sequence was with its cameo by Bea Arthur.As for the coming attractions at the end, it now seems pointless, not only because there never was a sequel, but because it really isn't funny. So a in all a mixed bag, but middle of the road Brooks is certainly better than no Brooks.

There are quite a few scatological jokes from Dom DeLuise burping and farting in the Roman sequence to Harvey Korman's peeing in the French Revolution segment. And then there's Mel Brooks, who not only produced and directed this, but also single-handedly wrote it and stars in most of the sketches. Seeing him doing the Spanish Inquisition as a Busby Berkeley-Esther Williams number was perhaps the most irreverent thing he ever did especially when the nuns doff their uniforms to reveal their one-piece swimsuits and bathing caps! Gregory Hines made his film debut here and is a hoot whether doing his dance steps in order to keep him from trouble or making a giant joint to distract the Roman guards! Madeline Kahn and Cloris Leachman also contribute their funny selves to good effect and then there's longtime Brooks associate Sid Ceasar playing a cave man in the Stone Age segment also being his usual funny self. Really, all I'll say now is if you are a die-hard Brooks fan, I highly recommend History of the World, Part I.

Having made his reputation with the 2000-Year-Old Man, it seems inevitable that Brooks would eventually take on the spectrum (or sphincter, as he might put it) of world history. And in the age of the Farrelly Brothers, Brooks' ideas about bad taste seem almost quaint.It begins with a lot of black-out gags (the first such gag amounting to, Ape Man = Onan) and takes off from there. The first sustained sequence, The Roman Empire, probably goes on a bit too long, and it introduced a buxom actress named Mary-Margaret Humes who, justifiably, went right back to obscurity shortly after the film's release. But there are also many enjoyable moments Gregory Hines's mellow film debut, Madeline Kahn's ecstatic song tribute to her well-endowed male slaves, and most of all, the Last Supper sequence at the end--completely messed up time-wise (it puts Jesus and Leonardo da Vinci in the same shot), but all the more hilarious because of it. (John Hurt plays Jesus, and as in Brooks' Spaceballs, his straight-faced seriousness just makes the insanity around him that much funnier.) The next sequence is one of Brooks' best The Spanish Inquisition as a Marx Brothers-style musical number, with Mel Brooks as a socko Torquemada, beating out a rhythm on his victim's shackled knees. This sequence alone justifies Brooks's existence as a comedy director.The sequence depicting The French Revolution, has two main objectives in mind show off as much of (1) British comedienne Pamela Stephenson's bust and (2) Brooks's wee-wee humor as humanly possible. Nevertheless, it has its moments, with Cloris Leachman as Madame Defarge, and Brooks as a randy king.The final short sequence, a trailer for Brooks's non-existent History Part II, is worth the bother just for one of those moments that makes me laugh for no discernible reason a scene from Hitler on Ice, showing Brooks' favorite nasty German as an Ice Capader. This ersatz trailer is enough to make me wish Brooks had really made a sequel. I doubt it would have turned out any worse than Spaceballs.

Even his trademark Hitler spoofs, such as the Hitler on Ice-coming attraction here show his own obsessive and strong reaction to that horrible period in history. Some of the jokes have cobwebs such as the Alms for Oedipus beggar and Gregory Hines response Hey there, m.f! But it works because it's carried off with energy.In the long run, the film is probably more serious than it seems on first glance and has more bite than the really feeble attempts to follow such as Spaceballs, Robin Hood or Dracula.

The film is not as all encompassing as its title implies, but Mel gives his own twisted vision to these particular times in earth's history, which includes Mel himself in four different roles, including Moses and his own version of Louis XIV (It's Good to be the King). Mel gathers his usual nutty repertory company together and laughs are provided by Sid Ceasar (very funny as a caveman), Madeline Kahn and Dom DeLuise (hysterical as Cleopatra and Ceasar), Gregory Hines, Cloris Leachman, and Harvey Korman as Count De Money (That's De Monay!!!).

A lot of it has to do with the disjointed approach of picking random moments in history which don't link up together. The Roman section is longer and generally funnier, but there is still a sense Mel had a couple sight gags and punchlines in his head and tried to cobble together a third of a movie around them. It goes on way too long (as does the movie) and the viewer winds up waiting for the end of the World. Compare the filmography of the first half of Brooks' career (The Producers, The Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie and High Anxiety) with the second half (HOTWPO, Spaceballs, Life Stinks, Robinhood (Men In Tights) and Dracula -- Dead And Loving It). All of the movies from the first half are critically praised, genuinely funny and worthy of repeated viewings. Few of the movies from the second half hold up. Something happened to Mel or his audience, but perhaps we may never find out because it has now been 8 years since Mel last directed (the disappointing Dracula -- Dead And Loving It.) While he enjoyed a comeback with the Broadway success of The Producers, that source material dates back 35 years. It is doubtful that at his age and with the weak track record of his last films that the once-hilarious Brooks will ever be allowed to direct a major movie again. 5 / 10 "},{"Title":"Guinness Book of Record's attempt for most crass sex jokes in a movie.","Date":"3 September 2003","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Slapdash trawl through history which contains nothing whatsoever besides camera mugging, crude sex gags and chase scenes. While I would try and not be Chinese-like in rewriting history there cannot be many comedians as indifferent as Brooks. Capable of making classic films like Young Frankenstien and even the Elephant Man he is also capable of making stinkers of such desperation that you wonder what goes through his head. Is he trying to second guess the audience (if so then his opinions of the audience must be low) or does he really think things like twenty men (all clothed) jumping on a woman while he shouts gang bang - gang bang is funny?Indeed the expense of film would make a normal person think twice about using expensive locations (a real French court, for example) to play out underdeveloped sketches that differ from 1950's TV only because of swear words and sexual references. Indeed you wonder if he can think of any other subject to make jokes about? Being the script writer, producer, director and lead(s) hardly leads you to think that he is a democrat; although I am sure his repertory company of glad-to-have-jobs probably don't care as they are clearly unwanted elsewhere.  The problem is that Brooks is not really all that good an actor (he wants to whey-hey in to camera after every gag, presumably to allow time for  the cinema audience to climb off the floor)  or dancer and he his singing shouldn't leave his own bathroom. Why are all these things included? Desperation? There can't be any other reason.

And if we were to measure comic ability and creative genius, his would certainly be over flowing its cup.And it was at the Sid Ceasar-Imogene Coca weekly Comedy Review YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS on the NBC Television Network that he honed and perfected his wit and penchant for the offbeat and the unlikely targets for our laughter. Of course, he wasn't alone as a master funny guy in this conclave of zany inventiveness. His Classmates included His best friend, Carl Reiner, Woody Allen, Howard Morris and Neil Simon. Now that's not too shabby of a crowd to be hangin' out with, no? His interests were broader, though and soon he was performing in front of audience and camera with such now famous set pieces as his collaboration with Carl Reiner as THE 2,000 YEAR OLD MAN and such similar type works. (If similar type works is the correct term!) Mel's snowball had started rolling down the old Hillside, and there'd be no stopping it; as it gathered an ever increasing critical mass, that would explode on the Hollywood Scene making the man one guy who could write his own ticket. He certainly did do that thing and soon we were treated to titles, such as THE PRODUCERS (Crossbow Prod. / United Artists, 1968), which of course is his own story, screenplay and Direction. He followed that up with THE 12 CHAIRS (Crossbow / United Artists, 1970), which kept the Mel Brooks Bandwagon cruising along.Then in seeming rapid succession, we were treated to BLAZING SADDLES! (Crossbow Prod. / Warner Brothers, 1974.), YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN (Crossbow Prod. / 20th Century-Fox, 1974), SILENT MOVIE (Crossbow Prod. / 20th Century-Fox, 1976) and his spoof send-up of Mr. Hitchcock's work in HIGH ANXIETY (Crossbow / 20thCentury-Fox, 1976). Well, even DiMaggio's streak ended and so did Mel's with this HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART I. Perhaps it was the Good Lord's way of reminding Mel and us, his loyal followers, that he, too, is only human after all.OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133;is really a phrase that doesn't fit here; as we have a whole bunch of very well disconnected and episodic sketches, each one only bound together to the others by their being a part of History.* From Stone Age Caveman to the dawning of Modern Day, Mel took us there with some very amusing moments; but not nearly enough of them. Some of his gags were just plain D.O.A.; others bordered on the sophomoric and others still were titillating little bits of non-funny business, bordering on being Blue Humor. Mel even violated one of the cardinal rules of making comedies (or farce). He went and ended the final forgettable sketch with an unashamed reference to occurrences in a previous, non related sketch; then topped that off with a speech of his own that went something like Yes, that's the wonderful thing about Movies!, or some such.We all are well aware of the recent success of the Musical adaptation of THE PRODUCERS, from movie screen to Broadway Stage. This was further bumped up the evolutionary track to a new, this time musical film adapted from the stage play that was adapted from the original 1968 movie. We know that everyone has felt happy for Mel and congratulated him, wishfully anyhow.Tonight we have seen for the first time an advertisement for a Broadway Musical treatment of the Gene Wilder-Mel Brooks collaboration, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. We wish Gene and Mel nothing but Good Luck in this endeavour, feeling certain that it surely will be as successful as THE PRODUCERS was.And we know that we can say for sure that there'll be no HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART I following in its path on the Great White Way.NOTE * We are put in mind of the Irwin Allen/Warner Brothers Big Cast,Big Bust of a misfired dud, the overly ambitious THE STORY OF MANKIND (1957), which was an equally ill-conceived and overly ambitious book by one Henrik Van Loon.

'History of the World Part I' is again funny, but it is very flawed as well. This movie does not tell a story with gags in it, it tells gags with a couple of stories around it.Mel Brooks seems to have chosen a couple of events in our history, at random, as long as his jokes would fit there. We start with the dawn of men, the stone age and a story around the ten commandments. These segments are not that long and I found them hilarious. The narrator, Orson Welles, explains us how things started back then, things like singing and painting. It is the kind of humor that requires a certain taste, but if you like it Mel Brooks is as good as it gets. Most of the time.We continue with longer segments including one in the Roman Empire which starts great but after a while it overstays its welcome, a musical number dealing with the Spanish Inquisition that has the same problem, and one during the French Revolution that is not that funny at all. Especially in these sequences we see how Brooks has the idea of a funny gag, puts a story around it without really doing something with both the idea of the gag and the story. It is like watching Jim Carrey doing funny faces without a reason for doing that. His funny face can be funny when it is serving something, it is not simply funny on its own.Near the end Brooks finds his way again and shows us what we could expect in Part II. I laughed like I did in the first half of the movie and that gave me the feeling the movie is funnier and better than it actually is. Fans of the genre will enjoy this enough, there is some real Mel Brooks magic here, but if you are still finding out whether you like this or not I would start somewhere else.

I really, really loved the vulgar Oedipus joke.I could question the historical accuracy, such as the cave paintings being in America rather than Europe, but since a dinosaur appears soon after, I figure they really did not care very much about this.Brooks has his cast of regulars ready here (Dom DeLuise, Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn), and also Gregory Hines (in his screen debut), a welcome addition. "},{"Title":"Laughing Out Loud","Date":"20 October 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Comic perspective is usually determined in the opening moments of a funny movie, establishing the rules of the new world and hooking the audience. Well, History of the World Part I begins with cavemen waking up and humping air for what feels like a solid 2 minutes. This is his Dawn of Man segment, a vague parody of Kubrick's 2001, before he moves on to The Stone Age during which the first art critic is sent up, and then mocks Moses in an Old Testament sketch, which is essentially a single joke that we fade into and out of that quickly. Where Brooks really goes to town is during The Roman Empire. He stars as a stand-up philosopher who, along with a black slave played by Gregory Hines and a defiant vestal virgin, brings pandemonium to the court of the extraordinarily hilarious Emperor Nero, in one of Dom DeLuise's most memorable performances, and Madeleine Kahn, his nymphomaniac empress.We're actually surprised when the movie moves on, because it seems to have decided to develop some semblance of a story there, unlike its preceding episodes. But it does, and Brooks again takes center stage as Torquemada, who celebrates his ecstatic pleasure in torturing Jews who reject Christianity in a Busby Berkeley tableau abounding with melody, singing, and a water ballet. Oh, and a funny little aside elucidates some unanswered questions about how Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Last Supper. Ultimately, Harvey Korman steals the spotlight from Brooks, as per usual, in an absurd caricature of The French Revolution. Korman plays foppish nobleman Count De Monet, who turns up with a cunning plot to save King Louis XVI from death at the hands of the mob by switching the King's lowly doppelganger on the crucial occasion.This is an incoherent, disorderly, sometimes awkward romp by one of the most talented comic filmmakers, who never seems to have a clear idea of the underlying principle of his seventh film escapade, so there's no assertive narrative incentive to bear it along. His historical context doesn't have any method or perspective. It's basically just an assembly line for whatever jokes he can sling on it. What is this off-the-wall grab bag? Is it a lampoon of old Biblical, Roman and French historical epics? From time to time. Is it a never-to-be-repeated, comedy vaudeville seizure? Now and then. Is it a send-up trained at haughty foils? Every so often. But generally it's in essence simply valuable sets standing there expecting Brooks to do something comical before them.Synchronously with Woody Allen, Brooks has helped sustain the comedy genre in contemporary films. As Allen has turned increasingly sophisticated and contemplative, Brooks has gotten increasingly campy and preposterous, the politically incorrect auteur and effortless ham actor's rudimentary oomph let loose flat out with this outrageous 1981 package picture, in which---rather than taking razor-sharp bites out of status quo mythologies and nostalgic legends as he did with his crowning achievements Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein---he indulges in our incessant need for mocking the sort of unconsciously class-based theories of manners and good form that inadvertently made burlesque all the rage in its puritan heyday. As in all movies by the ambitious Brooks, there are dull patches where the farce and the gags just don't work. But hit-or-miss is his style, so when he does hit, he hits the bullseye. Or at least somewhere in the red or yellow.

Caveman (Sid Caesar) learns about fire and vaudeville, when one of his fellow cavers gets hauled off a stage by a dinosaur. Next up is Moses (Mel Brooks himself) who is bringing down the 15 Commandments but ends up dropping and pulverizing the tablet with five of the biggies on it. Much time is spent telling the true story of Ancient Rome, where Nero (Dom DeLuise) is still crazy as a loon but likes stand-up routines and where his wife, Nympho (Madeleine Kahn) can make decision or two behind his back. Slave Josephus (Gregory Hinds) dodges a few swords but ends up on the road to freedom, where he and others find a nice patch of weed and decide that the collapse of the empire is nothing serious. And, so it goes. Brooks has created a nice little humorous movie, sending up some of the more heinous periods of world history (The Inquistion, Madame LeFarge (Cloris Leachman) and creating mirth. The cast is the greatest asset, for the members are truly legends who could make a stone giggle. The sets, costumes, and production values are also quite wonderful and the script and direction are zesty and humorous. While my personal favorite of Brooks' movies remains Spaceballs (my hair, they shot my hair!), this one will do more than nicely when comedic relief is greatly needed. It might even send viewers to the library or the internet to learn the historical facts about the real events behind the laughs. In any case, make it part of your personal history to record a viewing of this funny little flick.

In rewriting history from his suggestive and bawdy view point, he introduces us to some hilarious moments. Despite the exaggerations there is probably an ounce of truth in some of the questionable scenes he has portrayed.Film goers with a long memory will recognize scenes, music and dialogue from the flicks they enjoyed years ago and now with the passage of time wonder why they were so enthralled at those Saturday night movies. It's a part of the fun to recall the old films and a second viewing is probably needed to ensure that none of the funny bits are missed.The scenes are well mounted and I have a suspicion that the large sets are snippets of past films with garrisons of Roman soldiers filling the screen and crowds of French on-lookers for the scenes of the guillotine. I think my favourite segments are the surprise entry of the nuns in the Spanish Inquisition (possibly because I had a few days earlier watched the Secret Files of the Inquisition) and the French Revolution in which a portable pissoir adds to the bawdiness of the times. Could there ever have been such an enterprising invention? Mel Brooks' humour is not subtle and the slap-stick approach could probably be best enjoyed after a few drinks with friends. I have to admit I was not rocked with laughter but have to conclude he shows a degree of cleverness and originality in the writing. Yes, I did laugh a couple of times It's an awesome project to write the history of the world and a lot more has happened since the French Revolution.

He surrounds himself with a more-than-capable cast, including such mega-star comics as Caesar (whose caveman seemed to develop all of man's first inventions all by himself), Kahn (his eternal diva and a sassy diva at that), Greene (pompous, puffed-up and ready to pop), DeLuise (making slobbery a pure art form), Korman (Hedley Lamaar in royal French garb - and still as funny), and even such loyal stand-bys as Carter, Murray, Milligan and DeLuca offer able-bodied support.But let's not forget Hines.  In his first major motion picture role as Josephus, he shucks and jives, sand-dances and withstands the fiery dancing of Caledonia like a pro.

Not even if the original had made $300 million!  So forget about that and just watch THIS movie.  It definitely had its good moments.  Yes, some segments lasted a few minutes too long.

It's not quite on the same level as BLAZING SADDLES, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and THE PRODUCERS. It's not a great film like those three are. It's just a very, very funny movie as only Mel Brooks could make it. I find it interesting that the successful MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL was inspired by the break-the-fourth-wall lunacy of Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES, but here, Brooks seems to be imitating Monty Python somewhat (especially the religious jokes a la LIFE OF BRIAN). I'm not accusing Brooks of copying, though, because he displays his usual original (and far-out!) sense of humor here. This film (like MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, interestingly) has a huge cult following, and is one of the cool movies to see if you're in high school or college. (Many kids in my high school have pictures from this film posted inside their lockers, and everyone owns it on DVD.) So, this film isn't designed to be great (although as I said, at least three of Brooks' films are great motion pictures as well as being screamingly funny). Instead, it belongs in the same category as SILENT MOVIE, HIGH ANXIETY, SPACEBALLS, and ROBIN HOOD MEN IN TIGHTS-funny, light entertainment that succeeds in what it sets out to do.

HISTORY OF THE WORLD PART 1 (comedy, 1981) A farcical telling of the history of the world. From the 'Stone Age' to the French revolution.Critique Though many critics (and fans) regard Mel Brooks' first film, 'The Producers' (1968), as his masterpiece, I consider this to be his funniest and most innovative work. With Brooks' giving a tour-De-force-comedy role as writer, director and actor.Narrated by 'monochrome voiced' Orson Welles, it stars many of Brooks' regular troop including Cid Ceaser, Mel Torme, and Gregory Hines in his first starring role as the Roman slave Josephus (from 'Ethiopia . . .105th street'). The film opens with the 'Dawn of Man' sequence (modeled after '2001'), as the 'man-apes' stand up and become humans, masturbating to the classical theme of 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'. Then we move to the 'Stone Age' where we see how comedy, music and the first 'homo-sapien' (and'Homo-sexual') marriages came to be. The scene then shifts to the brief Old Testament sequence where Moses (Mel Brooks) descends from Mount Sinai with the '15' (and not 10) commandments. Then comes the center piece of the film, the Roman period which follows Comicus (Brooks again) and his attempts at getting a job as a 'stand-up philosopher' in Caesar's Palace. We are also introduced to the character of Josephus, Caesar (Dom DeLouis), Swiftus (Comicus partner) and Susan (a 'vestal virgin'). 'The Spanish Inquisition' period becomes a musical where the monks exact torture on Jews with song and dance. The last part deals with the French Revolution as King Louie is replaced by the piss boy to escape execution (a take off on Dumars' 'The Man in the Iron Mask'). The film's humor comes from the fact that everything said is taken literally. When Caesar asks for a small liar to play, his guard brings him a small thief. What also makes it funny is the many sexual references throughout, especially in the French period where it's good to be the King!. Whatever happened to 'History of the World Part 2'!!?

Mel's best joke at Caesar's Palace was  We Romans have a god for everything. The only thing we don't have a god for is premature ejaculation. But I heard that's coming too soon. The centurion testing whether the Gregory Hines character was really a eunuch presents a woman to perform what he called an erratic dance which it truly was. I wonder if I was the only one who got the joke. The serving maid to Empress Nympho (Madeleine Kahn)looked very familiar and was a great foil to Kahn.I stopped asking waiters at restaurants I visit for the first time what's their specialty ever since I saw this movie. Why? I may be given something like the mold wine Mel's boss, the tratorria owner kept telling him to push because they were overstocked with it.

Though the movie is made as a series of 5 or 6 shorts, ranging from a few minutes to a half hour, the laughs are spread out over the entire film.  Every sequence has plenty of great bits, and you could watch it all the way through or just pop in the disc to see your favorite part.The Inquisition musical sequence is one of my favorites, and will be a favorite of anyone who likes Brooks' other musical numbers (especially now, with the Producers a broadway smash.)  Unlike another reviewer, I *never* get tired of the skeet-shooting with peasants scene.  Madame DeFarge running out of wool should give a good chuckle to anyone who's read Tale of Two Cities, as will the old man with his birds in the Bastille.Some of the jokes flop, but the ones that don't more than make up for it.  Not as good as Blazing Saddles, but probably Brooks' 2nd best film, and that's saying a lot.

He once again graces us with his incomparable talent.  Brooks' method of spoofing historical events and topping it off with a little off-color humor is very impressive indeed.  The first two acts are hilarious!  I could not stop laughing!  There's a good deal of memorable moments that fans of Mel will remember for ages and ages.  One (which often comes up in retrospectives) is the scene where Moses (played by Brooks) has to deliver his Fifteen--I mean, Ten Commandments.  Another moment I will always remember is when Comicus (also Brooks as a stand-up philosopher in ancient Greece--Yes, you heard right) is the waiter for Jesus and his disciples when Leonardo Da Vinci paints his famous work The Last Supper.  Comicus repeatedly yells Jesus and Jesus repeatedly responds, What?  I really got a kick out of that.  Expect many great performers (many of which are regulars in Brooks' work) including the late Madeline Kahn, Gregory Hines, Sid Caesar, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman and others.  Another great ensemble cast for another great Mel Brooks comedy!I also have to note the great Spanish Inquisition musical number--another classic moment.  This includes a cameo by buddy Carl Reiner (Talkamatta!  You can't talkamatta anything!).  I admit, towards the end the comedy sags a bit.  The gags in the third act aren't as memorable as the previous ones. So if you're a fan of the Brooksmeister--or just a fan of good comedy!--please check out this gem.  You won't be disappointed!  History has never been this fun!My score  8 (out of 10)  "},{"Title":"Both better and worse than expected....","Date":"26 February 2001","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I recently acquired the DVD version of History of the World Part 1.  While I saw this movie many times as a kid and loved it, I hadn't seen it in quite a while and was looking forward to seeing the real version without all the censoring for TV play (I've only seen this on TV, although I can't say for certain whether I ever saw it on a movie channel where it wasn't censored). After watching the DVD, it turns out that some parts of the film are even funnier than I remembered, while others didn't make me laugh as much as they used to.I found that the first half of the movie was by far the most funny...all the way through the Roman Empire segment (which is probably the longest segment in the film).  Even though I knew most of the jokes that were coming up, they made me laugh anyway, and there were several jokes that I had either forgotten or which had been cut out/mangled by TV censors so I hadn't seen them.  Although I knew I liked this movie, I found myself surprised at how hilarious it was.Then came the Spanish Inquisition sequence.  I remember not really liking this scene as a kid, but then I've never been into musicals.  This time around, I liked it a lot better...I don't have a negative impression of it anymore.  Still, it's not quite as funny as the earlier parts of the film.The last bit of the movie is the French Revolution -- I remembered lots of funny stuff in this segment from when I watched this movie long ago. However, this segment is where the movie was a bit disappointing...a lot of the jokes which I used to find hilarious (such as skeet-shooting with peasants) just didn't click with me like I expected them to.  Also, I found that the number of gags in this segment was significantly reduced from previous parts.  I have fond memories of the French Revolution segment, so I'm a bit puzzled as to why it didn't do much for me now.  Maybe I just remembered TOO MUCH from this segment so there were very few surprises?But as a whole, I definitely think this ranks as one of Mel Brooks' best films.  I count it as part of the holy trinity along with Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles.  Others have said that this is one of Brooks' raunchiest films, and I definitely agree.  There are quite a few sexual gags in this, and several uses of the F word (I don't remember that word being used at all in Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, but maybe I've just forgotten...).  Highly recommended!
