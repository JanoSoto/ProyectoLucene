(1966, France, Not Rated 102 min. Directed by Claude Lelouch with Anouk Aimée, Jean-Louis Trintignant). I recently watched `Lumière and Company' which celebrates the 100th Anniversary of the movie industry.  Forty directors from around the world produced 52-second films using the Lumière camera.  The fifty-two second time limit and other constraints follow the construct of the first Lumière movie.  Of the 40 films, the by-far-and-away best is the one of two lovers kissing.  The man and woman are on a rotating stage so we get a 360-degree view of their kiss.  In the background we see photographers each with progressively more modern cameras.  The love or passion of the man and the woman don't change only the way we are able to view them now and then.So what does this have to do with Claude Lelouch's 1996 movie, `A Man and A Woman'?  Well he's the director that made the above mentioned film and it reminded me that it has been years since I last watched `A Man and A Woman.' I rented and watched it again.Jean-Louis Duroc (Trintignant) and Anne Gauthier (Aimée) are a man and woman.  They meet incidentally at the boarding school where they visit their children each weekend.  He visits his son, she her daughter.  She misses her train and he offers her ride back to ride back to Paris in his car. Slowly and cautiously we learn about them as they learn about one another.  We learn about their jobs, their former spouses, and other details of their lives that have the movie viewer hoping this man and woman can become a couple.Lelouch's technique in telling the story is wonderful.  The film switches from black and white to color.  The switch usually comes on the change from person-to-person conversation to personal thoughts or a recounting of the past.  It's like Lelouch is using this change as quotation marks or thought balloons on the screen.  We see/hear Jean-Louis' and Anne's thoughts as they question their feelings about beginning a new personnel relationship.  I first saw this movie as a college student in 1966.  I really liked it then. I wondered if I'd liked it now. The movie hasn't changed but I can assure you I have.  `A Man and A Woman' proves that a good story, well told can be appreciated now and then.  I highly recommend that you rent and watch `A Man and A Woman.'

Lelouch plays with colors, objects, and our natural capacity for associative memory to tell us what is neither written nor spoken. The main actors, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Anouk Aimée master the art of expressing the message. Dialogs are far from poor, but the meaning sometimes has to be found in their tone, their breaks, their pace or, again, the characters' play. What would be cinema for if these were useless ?

The plot is quite simple, but the merit again is here the way to make it coherent. Another interesting characteristic was the successful use of nice soundtrack in several scenes. Similarly the story of each were said with several mute scenes. According to Lelouch the film gained its intensity because of its fast way of realization.

To me, this is one of the most beautiful, romantic movies made. And I was not even born yet when this was made, so I believe that if one tries, this movie can be relevant to many generations.At its heart, it's a love story. But not just any love story. The two leads are falling in love with each other, madly yet cautiously, but the two leads also have other loves. They each are still in love with their deceased spouses, who died too suddenly and at such young ages. Each lead is also in love with their children, around whom they build their worlds, and act as both mother and father--they are both single parents. The way the grieving process is treated in this movie is realistic and heartwarming. And both children are adorable, their scenes being natural and just plain cute. The children are interesting elements in the movie. They are both links to the past (links to the deceased spouses) and also the reason the two leads met.I have never seen more beautiful scenes than when Jean-Louis is driving his Mustang on the beach (Deauville, I think), when they are hanging out at the shore watching an old man and his dog, and when they go on a date and take the kids. The date with the kids is such a real scene, the dialogue being both meaningless and meaningful, as it's the WAY they speak to each other that is the interesting thing in that scene. That is why a lot of it is silent--it is beautiful how Jean-Louis grips Anne's chair, as if he cannot be close enough to her. Also, when Anne remembers life with her husband--in Brazil, with him singing a Samba and them riding horses--yes, it may be a bit overly romantic for some people, but it is beautiful nonetheless.I also have to say that the theme music is very pretty, classic, and has stood the test of time. Such a simple tune, and it goes well with the simple beauty of this movie.

He is a race car driver and she is in the movie business (at some high level that I could never identify). The only things that lift this above soap opera--there being a suicide, an accidental death, a near fatal car accident--are its stars and its style. It's a mood piece using soft focus, some poetic imagery, extreme close-ups, telephoto lens shots, and a romantic score. Some of the mood shots may or may not work for you, like a *long* take of a dog running on the beach. In the spirit of full disclosure I can attest that if you have a dislike of auto racing, then that will detract from your enjoyment. I think that in well over half of the scenes cars play a role people talking in cars, people racing cars, cars on oval tracks, cars being worked on. This could have been titled, A man and a Woman and Cars. This may have been an early example of product placement, since the Ford Motor Company got some advertising here.On occasion a scene is inserted that appears to have no relevance, but then it turns out to be a scene from a movie that Anne is working on. I think the primary goal of those scenes and the auto racing scenes are to provide some variety and excitement to prop up an otherwise weak plot line. The screen time devoted to Trintignant's profession totally eclipses that for Anne's and I found that that unbalanced the story.This slight film is overly calculated to please. I came away with only a superficial understanding of this man and this woman.

Well, I suppose it will be now a matter of my personal reaction to the film.I like the film, for it offered a genre different from the typical mainstream Hollywood plots. It appeals to me because it served a dish not so commonly served nowadays. I speak French, Spanish, German, Italian and have seen many European films, which really tend to be a slice of life type of a plot. I would understand that for most of us who may have been spoiled in terms of cinema indulgence (making it worth our money), slice of life films can become boring to watch. The use of mixed color and black and white film had served its purpose. Being a photographer myself, I felt the emotions Lelouch wanted to convey portraying scenes reduced to their monochromatic elements. Black and white indeed makes the scenes more poignant and dramatic. I believe it was the black and white portions of the movie which generated the strongest sentiments in me as I was going through the film.The race scenes, that I enjoyed as a male specie typically fascinated with machines, especially cars. However, I remember that during the sixties, a number of films, like that of Elvis Presley, would usually incorporate race scenes. Perhaps Lelouch was riding on with the trends of film-making of that era. The psychological profile of the characters is very realistic, especially the way their attraction for each other developed as they got to know each other more in a casual way--like in their case, spending time together in the car going to and returning from the boarding school of their children. Ainouk Aimee is certainly beautiful, but her physical beauty is underplayed here. In typical Hollywood fashion, physical appearance tend to be given much premium before falling in love. In this case, it was sort of a given, and emphasis is more on getting to know a person more as a better fertile ground in making true love grow. After all, as widow and widower, they would have outgrown significantly the adolescent romancing of love, or shall I say, mating instinct? Overall, I would like to affirm the awards this film has garnered. Great work, Monsieur Lelouch!

Here we have a glamorous couple in their mid-30's, under the thrall of insanely prolonged adolescence and too absorbed with their self-indulgent careers to undertake the day-to-day responsibilities of parenthood. We see them doing their respective things as they evade the pedagogical, and it's about as interesting as watching a guy fix a drain trap under a sink. Yeah, they look good, but anyone who has lived for a while knows that is not enough to sustain a relationship. The female is pining for her dead stuntman husband, who apparently really knew how to show a girl a good time. Now she's going for another adrenaline junkie, this time a race car driver. Sadly, this is an apt observation of how people seem to find lovers sporting the same characteristics that torpedoed their previous romantic involvements. They risk their lives motoring through inclimate weather to sustain the drama of their attraction...it's just silly. One notes that the male drives a first-generation Mustang, a mediocre iconically American product. At that time, purists were up in arms over the incursion of American culture and the English language into French society, so perhaps this is some sort of commentary pertaining thereto. Things don't go too well in the bedroom, and anyone who has had a partner trip out like that at the moment of truth must applaud its observation of the tragic differences between men and women as to sexuality. The final image is very cool and tres French, but it is questionable whether it is worth the time invested getting there. Thus I must damn this picture with faint praise.

Although the comments are worded differently, we all seem to agree that it is a great piece of cinema. The English translation of Un homme et une femme is A man and a Woman O.K, I have a fetish for 1960's memorabilia, ranging from the music, films, cars, fashion, the elegance of the era and just about anything that springs to mind. Therefore, I will always see beyond just a love story here, as I am not really blown away by love stories anyway. If I wasn't already familiar with the main theme soundtrack, (having recalled hearing it on radio as a very young boy) and the older model cars, it would be almost impossible to guess that it was actually filmed in 1966. The clarity of this picture is near perfect. The music behind this movie is also superlative and compliments the excellent cinematography impeccably. I am certain that without this soundtrack the film would not be as impacting, which I have not noticed from other comments. If I wanted to make this movie myself, I would have also added the Stan Getz & Astrid Gilberto tune The girl from Ipanema as it would have fitted perfectly in this movie, especially with the scene at the beach. Needless to say, this film is timeless.The blend of B&W with the colour filming really adds the finishing touches. This movie is also very elegant, stylish, romantic and above all realistic, as it does not end like most other mainstream romance movies. However, it leaves plenty of room for hope. With this film, the viewer may seem to feel as though it is going nowhere, but it uniquely captures your attention, as you seem to sense as if you are acting a part in this film yourself. It does have a very welcoming affect and we can all somehow relate to it in one way or another. Perhaps it is the reality of how it unfolds which is more real life than fiction.The rally cars, the snow, scenes from the city of Paris, the beautiful orange/red sky at the beach, the cafés, romance and the serenity of a healthy family union is my definition of happiness "},{"Title":"Something for everybody","Date":"24 September 2007","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" It's not surprising that Un Homme et Une Femme/A Man and a Woman proved a smash hit cars and stunts for the guys and romance for the gals, an impossible to forget love theme and a slight enough plot not to get in the way of the characters or be damaged by subtitling or dubbing. Rather than a love story it's really the prelude to a love story &#150; or at least a possible love story (an ambiguity the belated sequel Un Homme et Une Femme Vingt Ans Déjà would find few friends by resolving) &#150; with the mutually widowed Jean-Louis Trintignant's racing driver and Anouk Aimée's continuity girl still in love with her dead husband meeting through their weekend trips to visit their children in boarding school. It's a fitting start to their romance since the film was born when director Claude Lelouch, after driving all night trying to work out how to save his disastrous Les Grands Moments, found himself on a beach at six in the morning watching a woman with her child presumably making the most of what little time they had together. Shot on the hoof with a tiny crew with exteriors shot in colour to raise funding for a TV sale but the interiors shot in black and white to keep costs down, the film still works surprisingly well, striking just enough home truths about relationships and doing it with enough charm and skill to make the odd misstep forgivable, although if you've seen the sly opening scenes of Lelouch's La Bonne Annee you might find it extremely difficult to keep a straight face during the ending.

I first saw Un homme et une femme in the late 60's, I was young and liked it perhaps as much for the soundtrack as anything. Being young I could identify with a love story, but I had not and knew no friends who had lost their loves to death. Forty years later I have children of my own, know personally about the grieving process and have watched this film with fresh eyes. It has improved with time. The love story is still fresh, but so much more honest than what we usually get from Hollywood.Excited, and in love, the couple takes a room, but they, or she and he able to recognize it, are not ready for that step. They part, she for the train, he to drive back to Paris. As they travel they think about what has happened. A decision is made and the movie concludes on just the right note.The camera seems to love both Anouk Aimee and Jean Louis Trintingant, it holds on them. He places his hand on her knee, the camera goes to her face and lingers, we watch her think, we know what she will say, she says it and we are rewarded for being smart, for having a heart, for knowing something of the process of love.Perhaps that is what the movie did for me those many years ago for I have always regarded it as one of the great love stories certainly more so than the movie of the same name, for this movie teaches us how to love.It treats the roll of children in courtship tenderly as well. The children get to be themselves and the adults get a chance to decide if those children can be a part of their lives.

This statement is important because most often the problem with the romantic comedy or the straight romance is that the story is often too contrived, far-fetched, and/or lacking in true human emotion. In this film we see how two people fall in love and better yet we don't even get a happily ever after type of ending but rather we see that these two people are willing to love again after having lost their first spouses.  This film is also interesting in the way director Claude Lelouch structures his narrative. Not only do we never over-deal with the fact that they both lost their first loves we also find this information out at different times in the story and the information in the film is also communicated very visually which is interesting as opposed to hearing dialogue which if poorly delivered would come across as ham-handed. The psychological focus of the tale is definitely Anne Gauthier (Anouk Aimée). She is more the focus because we see both her falling in love with her first husband, Pierre, while Samba da Bênção' by Toquinho and Vinicius was played. On a side note, the addition of Samba to a French film shows how much broader their cultural horizons are than ours are. It matter not that they might not understand Portuguese for they recognize the Samba as probably the most wonderful sound ever created. We see Anne meeting her first husband and also how he dies. Then as she consummates her relationship with Jean-Luc we see her thought process as she flashes back to her time with Pierre and how difficult loving another man is for her. One of the best parts of the film on Lelouch's part was when Valérie (Valérie Lagrange), Jean-Luc's first wife, is in the hospital after his accident. We see not only her strife but the passage of time through a series of jump cuts. I found this technique much more effective than a series of dissolves or on very long take. In this sequence we also see how sometimes telling can be more effective than showing as we do not see her commit suicide but rather hear Jean-Luc say it with sadness in his voice. Another interesting technique in this film was alerting between color and black and white. In the very beginning of the film it was used solely to differentiate between a flashback and the present tense but rather in a reversed way. The flashbacks were in color. This presents the present as more gritty and not as joyful whereas the flashbacks may not have been happier they certainly were more colorful as they are with most people. What's impressive about 'A Man and a Woman,' as is often the case with a lot of French films is it's simplicity. We deal with real people in a real type of story, plot devices and formulas are completely thrown out the window. And in this film what we get is a much more enjoyable experience than any Hollywood formula could possibly provide.

There are countless musical montages with the couple happily walking around in beautiful settings...but it works because the music score is incredible. It also switches from black and white to color for no real reason (it seems the budget could only afford some color so the rest had to be black and white). Aimee and Trintignant are wonderful actors and so incredibly good-looking you're rooting for them every step of the way. One scene in which they meet and hug was so perfect and romantic that I started to tear up)). A lot of critics hated this because it's so lightweight but it captivated me and many other people. It was a big hit in 1966 and won the Best Foreign Film Oscar and (somehow) the Best Writing for the Screen! A big old romantic movie--a perfect date movie. I give this a 10.

More so than most romantic films that have released in recent years. Lelouch's execution is very simple. The director had intended to make it an all-colour feature but due to financial constraints, some of the scenes in black and white. Lelouch not only managed to make this work but this itself brings out a certain quality and gives it a unique touch. The cinematography, editing and score are remarkable. 'Un Homme et Une Femme' has a very European, more specifically French (obviously) look that is authentic, pure and certainly adds to the charm of the film. Lelouch and his co-writer Uytterhoeven's writing breathes poetry. The dialogues are of a few words and yet they feel so real, like any normal conversation between a man and a woman. The casting is terrific. A charismatic Jean-Louis Trintignant and a gorgeous Anouk Aimée have a natural chemistry and their sincere performances shine. Even the child actors have done a very good job.Pure, genuine, lyrical, visually dazzling and charming, 'Un Homme et Une Femme' is a fine example of romantic cinema at its best.

They meet at the boarding school of their children in Deauville, although both claiming to be married, we don't see their respective spouses with them. Anne carpools with Jean-Louis to head back to Paris, en route, Anne recollects fond memory of her husband Pierre (Barouh), a movie stuntman whom later she reveal has died in an accident. During their next scheduled trip to Deauville, Jean-Louis confesses that he is a racer who survived a tragic accident which unfortunately prompted his wife's suicide.

Francis Lai's iconic soundtrack lead by its enduring titular theme song (performed by Barouh and Nicole Croisille) is trance-inducing and incredibly attune to the pulse of the romance and its aftermath. The picture is also a fruit of a new generation of Gallo-trendsetters (Lelouch and Lai, are both under 30, and the crew is mostly youngsters), structurally unbridled, visually discursive, sonically enchanting, top-lined with a pair of uncontrived charmers, Trintignant and Aimée, it is a film of nigh perfection, which seems rather a windfall gauged through Lelouch's entire career path.Incisively, Lelouch's dichotomous rumination on the difference of gender politics hits the bull's eye, with regard to memories, woman is more prone to linger in the limbo of sentiments whereas man is inevitably more clinging to his carnal impulse (Jean-Louis already has a lover before he meets Anne). A bona-fide heart-stealer is the soul-touching shots of an old man with his dog on the beach side, that is how nostalgia is wondrously evoked in a movie, such a knockout picture, the more you think about it, the more affection will germinate afterwards.

Flashing back and jumping forward, and switching between black and white and color, LeLouche creates characters of some depth who are neither entirely realistic nor totally make-believe.I was intrigued to read on Wikipedia that one of LeLouche's films had been decried as misogynistic. I kind of understood upon observing Jean-Louis tell Anne It bores women to talk of technicalities. But I can tell you some trivia. The exotic-looking Anouk Aimee is winsome as Anne but needed a better hair stylist. (Was anyone else distracted by her constant efforts to keep her hair out of her eyes? She's even doing it in the movie poster!) The daring telegram she sends to Jean-Louis, after only two platonic outings together, made me gasp, but I suppose that was part of the fantasy here.Jean-Louis Trintingnant does well as the male lead, and it was intriguing to have that bit with his mistress and the racing magazine thrown in, showing that he could be a player just like untrustworthy men in real life.The back stories for this film are also interesting. According to Wikipedia, Aimee went on to marry Pierre Barouh, who plays her tragic husband in the film (they divorced three years later), and the actress, possibly a descendant of Alfred Dreyfus of the Dreyfus Affair, converted to Judaism later in life. (Barouh had been a hidden child during the Naziism of his youth.) Wikipedia also says it was Trintignant who'd suggested Aimee for the role of Anne.

I happen to be the younger sister of a homosexual brother. My brother told me about his homosexuality when he was seventeen, and I a younger teen. My brother had a great deal of influence over me. Our parents worked at night and we were left with each other during most of the day. In those days my brother and I got along famously. He complained about having to take me along, but he always asked me to come along. In those days there were many art films, mostly foreign that made a splash with homosexual themes; Lucino Visconti's The Damned, De Sicca's The Garden of the Finzi Continis, Bertolucci's films, and a number of other films.This film with its exclusively heterosexual theme stands out in my mind as an excellent evening that my brother barely tolerated. It's a perfect story because there's no mention of survival. They're both ok financially. No one has to live off anybody else. They're both relatively free spirits that do mostly what comes naturally. I guessed straight relations, not based on economics did exist, I said to myself looking forward to a brighter tomorrow. In fact I later dated a mechanic that tinkered with old classic sports cars, and always drove one. I'm convinced that his main attraction, was that behind the little sports car wheel, he reminded of Trintignant. Later on, I became Trintignant behind the wheel as I was assigned an office an hour and a half away from home. The only way to make it on time was to think of Trintignant and hum the tune all the way to the office. Tan... TanTan Taran...  Tan Have anyone made more movies like this one?

However, when they have an affair, Anne finds that she still misses her husband and is not ready for a new love. The open end of the story permits a great variety of possibilities and different interpretations for the viewers. In 1966, I was too young to see Un Homme et Une Femme in the movie theaters. Some years ago, I bought the VHS but somehow I forgot to watch this movie. A couple of days ago, my friend Dieckmann mentioned this movie and I decided to see it. I was impressed how such a simple storyline was transformed in a delightful and charming classic romantic movie by the talent of Claude Lelouch. The perfect chemistry of Anouk Aimée and Jean-Louis Trintignant, associated with their very natural and authentic performances and the beauty of Anouk Aimée, are very impressive and unique. The use of an excellent camera, a wonderful photography alternating colors and black & white and a fragmented screenplay is very ahead of time. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful and known in the cinema history. I have seen this movie for the first time in 2005, almost forty years later, and it is not aged. Un Homme et Une Femme was awarded in the Festival of Cannes 1966 and with the Oscar of the Best Foreigner Movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil) Um Homem, Uma Mulher (A Man, A Woman) "},{"Title":"56 year old must have been a very naive romantic","Date":"30 April 2004","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Oh dear - it must be difficult to understand how Un H&F appeared to romantic late-sixties 20 year olds.  There was just something of the slow, brooding love in that era.  The bloke chasing the night train from Nice to Paris and beating it by car was so tear jerking. OK, in 2004 it might be risible.  In 1969(when I think I saw it) it was lovely - and the LP sold millions. The film got an outing on terrestial TV on Christmas eve 1996,  and I remember my then 20 year old son considering it a load of old tripe, whilst I continued to swoon over it.Don't knock it - and it's now available on Video.

Not in the way of a good film, actually it's not a good film it all, but it still manages to stay with you after viewing. The cinematography and the actors are undoubtedly beautiful, but if you were to take that away there wouldn't be any good parts to support the movie. The write/director/cinematographer Claude Lelouch only succeeded as a cinematographer and no doubt would have been the best in his field if that were all he concentrated on.Concerning the ending, a lot of people say there is a tacked-on happy ending. While I do not share their view, the ending did not work for me. It lacked closure and left me with a strong impression that she was going to leave him shortly after the credits rolled. As for the male lead, catering to Anne's every whim, driving everywhere just for a glimpse of her. Well, he should have behaved like her cheating husband that Anne obviously considers much more of a man than Jean-Louis. Of course it is fair to say that I might enjoy the movie more if I watched a non dubbed full-screen VHS version. But then again the unending racecar scenes, the dogs running around on the beach, and the lamest sex scene I've ever seen would probably not leave a more positive impression on me.

At the time I first saw it I was my early 20s, and I remember swooning at the romance of it all. Watching it again, I felt embarrassed for my 20-something self. What a silly, superficial film, about silly superficial people - a racing car driver and a continuity 'girl' (as they were known in those days). I guess that was part of the appeal - giving people a glimpse into these 'glamorous' lives. The fact that it got the Catholic Church official seal of approval tells us a lot. It is also hilariously sexist by today's standards. And the intermittent interjection of musical interludes is just plain ridiculous. The syrupy theme music has become a cliché, and deservedly so. The children are refreshingly un-cute - particularly the multi-lingual Antoine. But not worth wasting 1h40mins for.

When I watched it, I assumed that being a dual winner (and there aren't a lot of them), it would be a magical film. Instead, it was a mildly interesting film about two people who are lonely and somehow find each other. While I have a VERY high tolerance for foreign films and stories with rather simple plots, I just didn't find myself engaged. Also, in addition to the ordinariness of the film, I thought the cinematography was rather poorly done--as if it were filmed with a Super 8MM camera. While not as ugly to look at as the very amateurish-looking Alphaville (by Godard), it just looked grainy. I guess this is the style in this film from the Realism school, but I don't think much of this. The music, though a little repetitive, was excellent, though.

I tried to assess it from a perspective of new cinema for the era it was made in, but that did not help the nagging feeling that this film maker was lazy and fundamentally deficient in film art when he created this boring exercise in arrogance. So why all the awards? An example of emperor's new clothes syndrome I guess. Some misguided critics jumped on an enlightened band wagon and the rest followed. This film is bad cinema tight closeups of people talking without the sound. Out of focus shots. Black and white interspersed with color which was distracting, abstracting and foolish. Disjointed scenes that have no impact on the whole - what in heaven's name is the purpose of the dog on the beach running around at water's edge?) Structure is non existent, (and the critics here may intone that was the intent, destructuralist cinema contravening the Hollywoodian schlock of the times), direction is erratic and puerile, and the subject matter void of any basic dramatic substance. So, in view of the opinion of those who are supposed to know better than I, I will assume that I did not get it, and this angers me.

Lelouch seems to have a very insightful eye for body language and ear for the tentative words two people who are slowly falling in love with each other might say (the lunch scene is exceptional; you completely forget that you're listening to actors). And Anouk Aimee is particularly luminous and beautifully enigmatic as the Woman. But sometimes the emotions tend to get overshadowed by Lelouch's insistent desire to be stylish and groundbreaking. And there are some scenes (especially the racing ones) that are pure filler.

Today we - or at least me - are used to seeing a craggy, lived-in face on Jean-Louis Trintignant and it's something of a revelation to realize that forty years ago he was actually handsome, but then I guess that probably Clint Eastwood must have looked something similar in his days as a TV cowboy in Rawhide. Arguably the movie opts for glamour at the expense of reality making it a sort of gallicized Doris Day-Cary Grant outing or love among the rich and chic but that argument can be countered by the many films featuring love among the poor-but-happy. Okay, so we have a racing driver and a continuity girl which means we have scenes of movie making and motor racing but are we saying that a racing driver and a continuity girl can't or are incapable of falling in love. Of course it's more pleasant to see a gorgeous young woman and a handsome man fall in love than to watch say an overweight steel puddler and a blowzy waitress do the same thing but if you know that going in then so what. Both actors here are more than up to expressing deep feelings without dialogue and of delivering dialogue in a realistic manner when called for; the images are mostly seductive as is the music, in short this is good old-fashioned entertainment.

Of course it has great quality the charm and the simplicity of the story, the true emotions and two great actors, who manage to keep their performances sober as well as intense. But the switching between black-and white and color images don't make sense, because they are randomly used. And then there's the music by Francis Lay that is way overrated and even gets a little bit annoying towards the end. The racing-images aren't that interesting and take too much time and some of the flashbacks are a bit ludicrous (especially the one of Aimee's former husband singing a Samba (?) song). But the strength of the script is still there and THAT really is the main quality of this film.

Overdirected within an inch of its life, Claude Lelouch's cinematic meditation on two lonely people has substance to the extent that it occasionally switches between black-and-white and colour photography without explanation, has come characters express their feelings in song (the samba Anouk Aimee's husband sings for her is the most ridiculous thing in the world), and spends what feels like countless minutes observing the two main characters in their main careers--Jean-Louis Trintignant races cars and Aimee works on film sets. The two meet when it turns out their children attend the same boarding school; they discuss their dead spouses, have coffee, take walks on the beach, fall in love and then do nothing. It's as if Lelouch purposely threw a monkey wrench in the progress of the French New Wave of the 60s just for fun. Aimee is beautiful and all, but in Fellini's La Dolce Vita she showed ten times more charm, sex appeal and finesse, and all in the first fifteen minutes of the film.  "}]
