[{"Title":"Stunning depiction of a gross miscarriage of justice","Date":"17 August 2001","Score":"60 out of 67 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Crime, Drama","Review":" This is an extraordinary documentary in which film maker Errol Morris shows how an innocent man was convicted of murdering a policeman while the real murderer was let off scot free by the incompetent criminal justice system of Dallas, Texas. The amazing thing is that Morris demonstrates this gross miscarriage of justice in an utterly convincing manner simply by interviewing the participants. True, he reenacts the crime scene and flashes headlines from the newspaper stories to guide us, but it is simply the spoken words of the real murderer, especially in the cold-blooded, explosive audio tape that ends the film, that demonstrate not only his guilt but his psychopathic personality. And it is the spoken words of the defense attorneys, the rather substantial Edith James and the withdrawing Dennis White, and the wrongfully convicted Randall Adams that demonstrate the corrupt and incompetent methods used by the Dallas Country justice system to bring about this false conviction. Particularly chilling were the words of Judge Don Metcalfe, waxing teary-eyed, as he recalls listening to the prosecutor's summation about how society is made safe by that thin blue line of cops who give their lives to protect us from criminals. The chilling part is that while he is indulging his emotions he is allowing the cop killer to go free and helping to convict an innocent man. Almost as chilling in its revelation of just how perverted and corrupt the system has become, was the report of how a paid psychologist, as a means of justifying the death penalty, interviewed innocent Randall Adams for fifteen minutes and found him to be a danger to society, a blood-thirsty killer who would kill again.This film will get your dander up. How the cops were so blind as to not see that 16-year-old David Harris was a dangerous, remorseless psychopath from the very beginning is beyond belief. He even took a delight in bragging about his crime. As Morris suggests, it was their desire to revenge the cop killing with the death penalty that blinded them to the obvious. They would rather fry an innocent man than convict the real murderer, who because of his age was not subject to the death penalty under Texas law. When an innocent man is wrongly convicted of a murder three things happen that are disastrous One, an innocent man is in jail or even executed. Two, the real guilty party is free to kill again. And, three, the justice system is perverted. This last consequence is perhaps the worst. When people see their police, their courts, their judges condemning the innocent and letting the guilty walk free, they lose faith in the system and they begin to identify with those outside the system. They no longer trust the cops or the courts. The people become estranged from the system and the system becomes estranged from the people. This is the beginning of the breakdown of society. The Dallas cops and prosecutors and the stupid judge (David Metcalfe), who should have seen through the travesty, are to be blamed for the fact that David Harris, after he testified for the prosecution and was set free, did indeed kill again, as well as commit a number of other crimes of violence.The beautiful thing about this film is, over and above the brilliance of its artistic construction, is that its message was so clear and so powerful that it led to the freeing of the innocent Randall Adams. Although the psychopathic David Harris, to my knowledge, was never tried for the crime he committed, he is in prison for other crimes and, it is hoped, will be there for the rest of his life. Errol Morris and the other people who made this fine film can pride in these facts and in knowing that they did a job that the Dallas criminal justice system was unable to do.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

For better or worse, Michael Moore and his undeniable ability for manipulating the cinematic medium have brought this endangered genre into theaters and living rooms across the country. Most of today's casual moviegoers are relatively new to the non-fiction feature. In the case of director Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line (1988), one film not only managed to free an innocent man from a lifetime in prison, but it also elicited a confession from the guilty party. After collecting dust on video shelves for over fifteen years, this groundbreaking documentary has finally arrived on DVD.Unless you're a devout cinephile or a video store clerk, you have probably never heard much about Errol Morris. As a member of the former category, I've been a fan of his since first renting The Thin Blue Line more than a decade ago. As I popped in that dusty VHS cassette and sat back, I relished what many critics and documentary purists had been hotly debating Morris was taking the genre to exciting new places, whether people liked it or not.As with all successful movies, a good doc needs a good story. In 1976, Dallas County police officer Robert Wood and his partner were patrolling their district late one night. The two pulled a blue car over to the side of the road, most likely to warn the driver of a busted taillight. Moments later Officer Wood was lying on the ground, fatally wounded by a series of gunshots. His partner quickly ran to his aid, but was unable to accurately retain and recall certain information about the killer's vehicle. Was it a Vega or a Comet? Did the driver have bushy hair or a fur-lined collar? These and many other questions emerged during the rushed investigation to bring the mysterious cop-killer to justice. The film itself opens more than ten years after the murder took place. Randall Adams, an oddly charismatic good ol' boy sits before the camera, revealing what happened that unfortunate evening in late 1976. He admits to having shared a ride with a young kid named David Harris. The two apparently attended a drive-in double feature, where they both drank beer and smoked marijuana. Shortly thereafter, Adams claims to have been dropped off at his motel for the evening. Meanwhile, Morris shows us the aforementioned David Harris, now in his mid-20s, talking cryptically about that night's events. This real-life Rashomon confronts viewers with several versions of the truth. It's unclear whether Morris instinctively knew the truth was still out there when he decided to pursue this project, but his previous experience as a private investigator seems to have paid off as we witness his off- camera interrogation of these two men.Adams, responsible or not, was determined guilty by the courts and sentenced to death. Despite having a police record as long as his shadow, David Harris became the primary witness against Adams in the case. His testimony alone might not have hung Adams, but at the last minute a trio of eyewitnesses to the crime emerged to corroborate his story. In the world of Errol Morris, people are a truly strange lot, and his greatest technique is to simply let his subjects talk and talk until their inherent weirdness becomes painfully evident. Such is the case with the three last-minute witnesses in the Adams case. The more we hear them speak, the greater that uneasy feeling in our stomach and chest becomes. We are bearing witness to a catastrophic miscarriage of justice.Morris employs a bottomless bag of tricks in this landmark film. While much of the film does rely on the presence of talking heads, he adds other elements to the mix, such as old movie footage, a haunting score by renowned composer Philip Glass, and the granddaddy of documentary no-no's dramatic re-enactments. The latter tends to be the most challenged aspect of The Thin Blue Line, but Morris uses it fairly and wisely. He tells this twisted tale in ways few people could. A shot of a swaying timepiece or a concession stand popcorn machine suddenly amount to much more than what we're simply seeing on the screen. All of these pieces are being put together, little by little, in the hopes that by the end we will see the bigger picture.When this movie was released in 1988, it was marketed as a non-fiction film, because the word documentary was thought to scare off ticket-buyers. The studio's attempts to pass it off as a murder mystery failed, but the movie made a minor splash once it hit video. It picked up plenty of awards from festivals and critics groups, but the Oscars didn't even bother nominating it. In fact, the Academy didn't so much as nod in Morris' direction until early 2004, when they nominated The Fog of War, his powerful, relevant look at former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. That film and Morris' two previous masterpieces, Mr. Death and Fast, Cheap & Out of Control have been available on DVD for some time. His first three films, Gates of Heaven, Vernon, Florida, and The Thin Blue Line, were recently made available either individually or in a 3-disc box set. All six of these films are unique, intriguing portals into Mr. Morris' strange universe, which is not so distant from our own. If it's dramatic situations, reality TV, or simply a great movie that you want, look no further than The Thin Blue Line. As one of the greatest documentaries of our time, it is all these things and so much more.Rating A "},{"Title":"An astonishing look at the criminal justice system.","Date":"27 January 1999","Score":"30 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Along with 1996's Paradise Lost, The Thin Blue Line should be mandatory viewing for those who believe that the criminal justice system eventually convicts only the guilty.

Documentarian Errol Morris indirectly argues that, at the very least, this evidence should have presented a reasonable doubt to the jury, and near the end of the movie, the audience has little choice but to accept his unbelievable findings.  And the film ends with a single scene of just a tape recorder and voices that should be recognized as one of the most powerful endings to a movie, ever.  A documentary masterpiece.

I remember being told a story (don't know if its true) of how the US President visited Saudi Arabia and on the last day of his visit he was treated to some public be-headings. When he questioned the morality of it, his host informed him that the handful of criminals punished represented the entirety of the criminal population for the past one year. The moral being that harsh punishments prevent crimes and caring too much about the aggressor leads to high crime rates. I personally lost faith in the prison system many years ago after reading about the Milgram and Stanford Prison Experiment findings. A harrowing Australian movie, Ghosts of the Civil Dead made me detest the prison system even more. In recent years Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have left a bad taste in the mouth. So, is the answer really the death penalty and other physical measures that can't be reversed? After seeing The Thin Blue Line I just don't know. This film has really affected me.An innocent hitch-hiker, and from what I saw in the documentary a decent man, is caught at the wrong time in the wrong place - a former sundown town called Vidor, Dallas County. He is implicated in the murder of a cop and is obviously innocent of the crime. The entire legal system of Vidor is bent to prosecute him. The reason the real killer is a 16-year old and there's no benefit in finding him guilty because he can't be given the death penalty. Randall Adams, in his 20's, can and must be punished because he's a stranger to these small-minded bigots and someone must pay! Shocking that people can think that way. It makes The Ox-Bow Incident and issues it raised 70 years ago valid even today. This was no more than a judicial lynching.Fortunately, in this case Randall Adams' case was reopened and he was acquitted and released, in large measure due to this documentary and the scandal it caused. The story is exceedingly well told and the end with the tape recorded last interview with David Harris is chilling. I can't say that after watching this I still have a clear opinion of what punishment should fit a crime, but it has certainly made me question the validity of the mentality present in so many Muslim countries. Who is to say there can be no similar travesty of justice there?

High schools show too many, on subjects like the life cycle of the loggerhead turtle. I see people snoozing at the thought of yet another educational non-fiction film.Well, I guess there was a period when they carried a bit more chic than in recent years. Flaherty made some money. And Mondo Cane, of course, if that was a documentary.But the whole field seems to have been revolutionized lately by Ken Burns and Errol Morris, the former with The Civil War series on PBS and the latter with this film. Morris had made an earlier movie, mostly about an animal cemetery, but the subject seems to have had limited popular appeal.The Thin Blue Line however is about the shooting death of a police officer and the subsequent conviction, imprisonment, and death sentence of an innocent man.The movie really IS innovative. There is no narration, for one thing. For another, the talking heads we see aren't labeled at the bottom of the screen -- Chester Smith, Accountant at Robbin, Cheatham, and Frisk Law Firm. Instead, Morris shows us close ups of newspaper clippings and other printed materials which just happen to mention the name of the person we are about to be introduced to. It's a small thing, true, but I can't recall the device's ever having been used before. It's unobtrusive and effective. (That's the sort of thing I mean when I call this film innovative.) The events are restaged and presented again and again from different points of view, the whole being carefully constructed, like a jigsaw puzzle, but a jigsaw puzzle for children, easy to comprehend. And it's easy to see why Morris latched on to this topic. Not only is it interesting per se, an investigation into the justice system in Texas, in which almost all the authority figures seem intent on extinguishing forfeited lives, but the actual performers we see on screen are remarkably at ease in the presence of the camera. They smile conspiratorially, practically winking at the camera. They look dramatically towards heaven and say things like, It's crazy. But all in a pleasant Texas drawl. Nobody gets excited. Nobody breaks down and sobs. (There's innovation for you!) Nobody get angry and shouts at the camera. It's all very smooth.But although the performances are good, they are still performances. No one seems to admit having made a mistake. Everyone enters his house justified. Randall Adams, the innocent guy who was railroaded into the slams because he was 28 years old and could therefore be given the death penalty, has been in jail long enough to know what he's about when he presents his case. He has a practiced, wounded appearance and manner, although he describes his experiences as if they happened to somebody else. You pick up things in jail, along with the tattoos. David Harris, the actual perp, smiles and shrugs disarmingly, and he keeps saying I guess and whatever. As cool as an ice cube in Sweetwater. He is, in fact, a textbook-perfect example of what used to be called a psychopath. He's pleasant looking, charming, and utterly without any conscience.In some ways the most interesting character is the spaced-out blonde who claims to have eyewitnessed the killing and identifies Adams as the murderer in court. She's the most interesting because her motives are the most obscure. Everyone else's goals are clear. Adams wants to save his neck. The prosecutor wants another conviction. But this babe is really something.She's constructed an old TV detective program with herself as the central figure.Two additional points. One is that the psychiatrist known as Doctor Death spent only 15 minutes with Adams in prison before testifying that Adams was an incurable murderer. I'm laughing as I write this. Anyway, Dr. Death gave Adams two tests. The first, which Adams describes as a lot of circles and squiggly lines, is the Bender Gestalt Test which was originally designed to measure brain damage. In the second part of the examination, Adams is asked to explain the meaning of a couple of adages. A rolling stone gathers no moss, for example. It used to be thought that schizophrenics were given to concrete thinking and that they had trouble reasoning abstractly enough to interpret these old sayings. It's not used anymore. One thing always bothered me about it anyway. One of the items is A new broom sweeps clean, and I could never figure out EXACTLY what that was supposed to mean.The second point is that Adams was given a new trial and released after this film was shown. In other words, Errol Morris saved Randall Adam's life, which would otherwise have been spent in prison. So what does Adams do after he's out of prison? He sues Errol Morris for having taken advantage of him! In TV interviews explaining his suit, Adams uses exactly the same bewildered expressions and gestures of helplessness that he does in this film. At least those eleven years weren't a complete waste of time because he obviously learned something, or whatever.

The two men hang out for a while, drank some beer, went to the movies, smoked some weed. At this point Adams says he went his own way to his motel with his brother, watched TV and went to sleep. Alternatively, Harris says the two men stayed together were stopped by the police when Adams took out a gun and opened fire on a police officer before driving off. This film follows the court case which charged Adams for the murder of a police officer, with the underage Harris (who was ineligible for the death penalty) as one of the main witnesses against him.I do enjoy a Perry Mason film because, after a solid hour of red herrings and question-marks, it always come down to the big reveal with Mason demanding isn't it true? ISN'T IT? as everyone gasps, the guilty confesses on the stand and justice is done. Sadly this is not a documentary but a basic TVM series and what the Thin Blue Line does so effectively is to get passed all our ideas of how justice works from films and presents a near-unquestionable miscarriage of justice. At no point does the guilty person get totally exposed (although the suggestion is very clearly there as to who it was) but instead Morris goes after the idea of reasonable doubt (which, if there is any, then the charged should not have been convicted). Starting at the very start of the fateful evening, Morris uses interviews and some reconstructions to tell the story of what happened from various points of view &#150; initially with a focus very much on the events as the courts saw it.From here he then uses these same contributions to inject a huge amount of doubt into the vast majority of the case for the prosecution. If you want to find it, there are things in here that could be taken as anti-death penalty but for me the film is pro-justice as opposed to anti-anything as it is essentially reinforcing the importance of reasonable doubt. By virtue of doing this, everyone involved looks bad and Morris wisely doesn't need to pick on anybody in particular directly. It is fascinating as a film but I can understand the occasional claim of it being dull &#150; I cannot agree with it but I can understand because, in a world where excess is the norm (style, action, violence, opinion) anything that is actually restrained and even handed could be taken as dull.This modern moaning aside though, The Thin Blue Line is a well made film that simply and matter-of-factly condemns the justice system as it applied to Randall Adams. One of Morris' best films and worth seeking out.

Down the years I can still recall Randall Adams drawling in his unforgettable voice The kid scares me, the ever-revolving red light on the cop-car and most of all Philip Glass' wonderful, hypnotic music. The depiction of the fateful night of the cold-blooded murder of the policeman is shown from, almost literally, every possible angle, conveyed in a highly stylised way with almost every speculated remembrance of the doubtful list of every dubious (and are they ever dubious!) witness played out on the screen, the effect, in so doing, to completely explode their fantasist recollections, as was no doubt the director's aim. The reconstructions are set alongside filmed interviews of most of the main protagonists (with the main exception of the second cop in the car who witnessed the killing). As you watch these, the centrepiece clearly becomes the contrasting testimony of the almost-certain murderer David Harris with the wronged Randall Adams, the first coming across from the start as duplicitous and uncaring, the latter as bemused but reasoning. I was particularly taken with the eruditeness of Adams, who suppresses his inner rage with admirable restraint as he points the viewer time and again back to the evidence. As an indictment of the American criminal justice system, it hits home hard; it appears that investigation standards head for the hills especially when the law has a cop-killer to nail. Thankfully the miscarriage of justice was eventually resolved although it makes you grateful for the coincidence which led director Morris to change the subject course of his original project to instead highlight Adams' case culminating in his release soon after the film was first shown. The film however is more than a crusading documentary and there is much for students and admirers of the film-makers art to enjoy. Unforgettable, really, almost haunting, and proof if needed that truth really is stranger than fiction.

The Thin Blue Line, by Errol Morris, is a documentary that recounts this infamous case, by way of interviews and reenactments. It's the story of a terrible injustice, one that almost cost an innocent man his life.What is so frightening is the fervor of Dallas officials to inflict the death penalty on someone ... anyone ... They weren't about to let the cop murder go unpunished. Adams was the most convenient target. Eventually, the truth would come out. But Adams would spend twelve years in prison, some of those years on death row. After his release, Adams never received any monetary compensation, or even an apology, from the State Of Texas, for that injustice. Interestingly, more than one Dallas County official associated with the Adams case was also associated with the aftermath of the JFK assassination, thirteen years earlier.Morris' documentary would have been easier to follow had it had subtitles, to indicate the name of the person being interviewed. Also, some of the film's material consisted of irrelevant flashback footage and repetitive reenactments. Further, the narrative presentation was at times confusing. Nevertheless, the main issue here is the powerful true-life story.If you can get around the technical weaknesses of this film, The Thin Blue Line is a gripping documentary about a real life case of American injustice, in a city that is notorious for its history of botched criminal investigations.

I have long struggled with my opinions on Morris' work, mainly because I am more of a purist when it comes to documentaries. I want to see footage, photographs, interviews, etc. that are going to back up a strong story, not a lot of camera angles, stark white backgrounds, and a post-modernist score.'The Thin Blue Line' had the latter presentation, so I immediately was slightly turned off &#150; until the subject of the film was presented. The location is Dallas, and it is the 1970's. Late one night, a squad car pulls over a car that does not have its lights on, but as soon as the policeman reaches the driver's side door, he is shot several times and murdered. The car pulls away before the policeman's partner is able to ascertain the license plate number or even the exact make and model of the vehicle. What follows is a veritable witch hunt for the killer (or killers) that ends with one man in jail who is professing his innocence, and another man, a career criminal who gets away veritably scot-free. Through various interviews with the players involved; detectives, alleged eye-witnesses, the accused themselves, Morris seeks to find out the truth in a case that comes down to a 'he-said/he-said' situation. 'The Thin Blue Line' is expert film-making in the investigative sense. Morris does his job in presenting as many facts as possible. The case finally came to a head a couple of years after the film was finished, but it is documented as being instrumental in the reexamination of the facts. I still don't necessarily care for Morris' style, but it cannot be argued that 'The Thin Blue Line' is an excellent documentary, and that he definitely has an eye for picking very compelling subjects. --Shelly  "},{"Title":"Great documentary experience","Date":"21 August 2002","Score":"14 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Regarding the issue of manipulation, lets face it people, all documentaries are manipulative - every documentary filmmaker is attempting to make a point, whether or not they care to admit it.

In the case of The Thin Blue Line the purpose of the documentary is clear, and the viewer is not tricked into believing that they are watching something objective.  Instead, it is quite upfront about its purpose, and therefore is a much more honest piece of work.  People should never accept anything they see in a documentary as fact, it's important to understand that documentaries are simply an attempt to present the director's perspective of a real-life situation.  It is the great documentaries that present their perspective in a convincing manner, and do so without boring the viewer to sleep.  Here The Thin Blue Line succeeds very well it is powerful, it is engaging, and it's extremely convincing.  Does that mean that everyone should be convinced?  Lets hope not.  However, it certainly should give everyone something to think about.The only real problem with the film is its over-use of re-enactments where they are not really that necessary.  For example, there is an image of a clock, representing the futility of time, which is too long for its own good.  The milkshake scene was also (intentionally)annoying.

David Harris, a young drifter, was initially arrested for the crime, but later testified that another man, Randall Adams, was actually responsible for the murder. Adams claimed to know nothing about the murder. Local authorities believed Harris, however, and Adams was eventually charged and given the death sentence. As the film begins, Adams has been in jail for 11 years, and Harris is serving time for an unrelated crime.Using dramatic reconstructions and many eye-witness testimonies, Morris' documentary dives headlong into the case. It's a Rashomon styled parade of conflicting testimonies and overlapping subjective viewpoints, the truth of the murder murky and shapeless, until things begin to focus. When the crime begins to coalesce, a pitiful picture begins to take shape rampant police corruption led to Adams being falsely convicted, Harris emerges as a juvenile psychopath, police incompetence is exposed, scapegoats are exonerated, corroborating evidence and testimonies are undermined, the moral character of lawyers, psychiatrists, law enforcement officers and expert witnesses is called into question, and even the testimonies of regular civilians are seen to be wholly biased, easily swayed by personal desires for money and fame. The film's point trust no one, test the gods, and keep probing until you find the truth.The Thin Blue Line was well received when it released in the late 1980s, but it would be a number of years before its influence on the documentary genre would become apparent. Morris' dramatic reconstructions of the crime &#x96; filmed in nightmarish, noirish hues and resemblant of a David Lynch film - talking heads, and overall aesthetic/approach would give rise to an entire documentary industry, influencing countless TV crime docs, court TV stations and investigative programmes. Adding weight to Morris' visuals is a mounting, powerful score by Philip Glass, which pulls portentously down on the picture like a hang man's noose.Still, for a film purporting to search for the truth, The Thin Blue Line is at times a thin work. Suspicious holes in Adams' memory are skirted over, and though the film places human faces on those ignored men and women who live on the fringes of society, either economically or psychologically, too little effort is put into delving into the lives of these characters. Subsequent writing on Harris (who has since been executed), for example, has demonstrated that he too was a victim, alcoholic and suicidal at the mere age of 11, and condemned to live with a violently abusive family. Also missing from the film is any trace of homosexuality, any trace of the psycho-sexual confusion these two men were experiencing and any understanding how their marginalization may have affected their sexuality. Indeed, psychopaths (both sexes tend to find psychopaths notoriously charming and sexy) are disproportionately bisexual, and many journalists and writers have since claimed that a bisexual or sexually confused Harris rejected Adams' sexual advances on the night of the murder, and that Adams is himself homosexual. But such avenues aren't explored in the film, nor are there any hints that Adams' sexuality played a role in the police convicting him (Texas was, and still is, renowned for its Gay Persecution Laws).Still, The Thin Blue Line is primarily interested in police corruption, and along these lines it works well. Morris makes it clear that the police failed to follow up on certain evidence merely because such evidence conflicted with the outcome they wanted to achieve. In other words, the police, like all human beings, engage in rationalizations, and tend to work backwards from their preconceived notions or expectations. Today, experts estimate that about ten thousand people in the US are wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year (which is roughly between 5 and 14 percent of all convictions). Sixty four percent of the people exonerated of serious crimes had been misidentified (usually erroneous cross-racial identifications), fifteen percent had false confessions forced out of them, and 44 percent were subject to prosecution witnesses committing perjury. For a similar, and arguably better documentary covering this same topic, see Murder on a Sunday Morning.8/10 &#x96; Though an influential and haunting documentary, time and countless imitators have rendered The Thin Blue Line somewhat slow and repetitive.

Prosecuting attorneys are not men who believe in doing what's right, but what will most successfully add to their reputation. A psychologist testifies against over 99% of those criminals he interviews so that they will get the death penalty. The police choose to believe a juvenile delinquent's testimony against a man who has never done anything majorly illegal in his life just because they cannot send a 16 year old to the chair, and they cannot fail to execute someone over the death of a police officer. Every single police officer and witness who had anything to do with the trial was discreditable, yet no discrediting evidence was ever allowed in the court. You may have guessed that this all takes place in Texas.Even with the power it carries, The Thin Blue Line has some structural problems. I wish that we had been given some more information on Randall Adams (although maybe there just wasn't too much to say). And I wish that we would have been able to hear the thin blue line closing argument of the prosecuting attorney, a speech that made the judge's eyes water. If you like this film, search out Paradise Lost The Child Murders of Robin Hood Hills, a documentary obviously inspired by this. That one is a little more convincing and powerful than The Thin Blue Line (although this one apparently helped to get Adams off the hook; of course, with the amount of evidence that the film amassed, it is difficult to let the man rot without one more chance).

A nightmarish, abstracted scene that David Lynch might have created, this drama plays over and over again, never going beyond the perimeter of the camera's widest angle. It not only traps the event in a space but also in time. The second is the editorial care with which the director frames serial offender David Harris - only in the final shot of this man speaking do we see him reach up to scratch his face, revealing his handcuffs.The story itself is a blatant miscarriage of justice (postscripts record Adams' acquittal). The most compelling thing is to watch those involved speak about the event. The belligerent and defensive self-righteousness of bigoted Dallas officers and a self-important judge bloat the screen; the calm equanimity of defence lawyers, detective Sam Kittrell and even Adams himself are as powerful an advocate as the evidence itself. There is very little music but what there is is the stripped down, undulating underscoring of Philip Glass. It's occasionally difficult to make out exactly what's being said given the mix and the nature of the vernacular and accents but that's a minor point for a major document. 7/10 "},{"Title":"shocking!","Date":"27 July 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Crime, Drama","Review":" I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, and boy was I surprised!

The whole movie has a very creepy feel to it, and I actually felt nervous throughout the whole movie, as if I was watching a horror film! The whole case is extremely interesting, and all the twists and turns of it kept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself trying to pick apart the case myself. The only problem I had with the movie, which is minor, is that it was told in a kind of fashion that had each time period (trial and accident) kind of mixed into each other, which is a creative way of telling the story, but I honestly don't like it in most movies because it can get very confusing. However, this doesn't really get too confusing and is still pretty easy to follow. With an ending I was not really left me speechless, I say this is a must see for anyone who is into trials or murders, likes documentaries, or is just looking for a good mystery type film (even though it is a documentary).

The film assembles a compelling presentation of facts, evidence, clues and speculation surrounding the arrest and conviction of (possibly) an innocent man, accused of murdering a Dallas cop. But watching it can sometimes be a frustrating experience, because all the available information points, convincingly, to another suspect, ex-con David Harris the same witness whose testimony sent Randall Adams to death row.The film happened almost by accident Morris became sidetracked while researching another project and began to investigate, on film, the case of Adams and Harris, two strangers whose paths crossed in Dallas one night in November of 1976. What the documentary maker discovered from his own methodical accumulation of clues, rumors, and offhand testimony was an overwhelming case against the young drifter David Harris, who clearly fingered Adams for his own crime. Morris was aided by a convincing and articulate defense presented by Adams himself, whose calm recitation of facts is often more hypnotic than the ominous Philip Glass music score.Morris reconstructs the case using old film footage, odd graphic digressions, dramatic reenactments, and interviews with almost everyone involved, including the likely true killer, who tacitly admits his guilt in the final scene. The film is more artfully arranged than most documentaries, and yet is so honest in its pursuit of the truth that it proved instrumental in correcting a miscarriage of justice (after it opened, the case against Harris was reopened, and eventually overturned).The director himself remains (as usual) all but invisible throughout the film, except for his trademark deadpan irreverence (the word blue in the title is colored red, and so forth). A tragic miscarriage of justice would seem an inappropriate source of laughs, but the streak of dark humor underlines the sometimes absurd workings of an imperfect legal system.

They are the incompetent cop, the inept detectives who are oblivious to truth or bare facts staring at them, the lying witnesses, the crooked psychiatrist who gave dishonest testimony and a self-deceiving and perverted judiciary uninterested in truth and hell-bent on executing people.But something happened which redeemed the whole sordid affair, and it came from an unexpected source, the apparently psychotic young man David Harris who seemed to kill with no remorse. He declared Randall Adams innocent at the end, and implied his own guilt. He later testified (not in the film) in court that he did killed the cop and set Randalll Adams free. The judiciary is extremely reluctant in admitting their own mistakes - watch another documentary Paradise Lost The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills, read about its aftermath and see how blatant the judiciary can be in ignoring its obvious mistakes. Without David Harris admission Randall Adams may very well still have stayed in prison. David Harris appeared in this film to be a young man who was traumatised, through no fault of his own, by the death of his brother and the subsequent punishment by rejection by his father. It perhaps does explain his apparent callous response to death, and says something about the damage that can be done to children by their parents by what they did. Understanding this, or the confession by David Harris of his own crimes, doesn't mitigated against the murders committed by David Harris. But he did a good thing at the end, a redeeming act in a world sinking in a morass of corruption and lies.Someone more cynical might say that he was already in death row for another murder, admitting this murder is of no great consequence, and it may just be an attempt to appear a better man than he actually is, or that it is actually the cleverness of Errol Morris that coaxed and elicited Harris's confession. Perhaps, perhaps not. From the film he appeared to me to be intelligent and surprisingly appealing, far less calculating and readier to admit his guilt once confronted with the truth than others in the film. Compare him to the people who directly or indirectly condemned innocent people to death (or in other words, committing murder through the judicial process) - for example, the Dr Death, who to his death refused to admit any wrong-doing, and his funeral was attended by many of the prosecutors who found his testimony useful in sending people, innocent or otherwise, to their death. These people are happy to execute innocent people, but refuse to admit they are wrong when confronted with the evidence. They are perhaps beyond redemption, and these are the people we place our trusted on to do the right thing and make the society a safer place. I have no moral or ethical objection to death penalty, but this film must make anyone wonder if the right people are in charge of making decision of life and death, or that given people on show here, if it is ever possible for find these right people.

This is a film that will give you a good reason to question the death penalty because it demonstrates that it could have just as easily been you that was convicted of a crime you didn't commit.Errol Morris uncovers evidence systematically and visually demonstrates all the possibilities to you the viewer who are substituted as the juror.

A man is convicted for murder in Texas on extremely thin evidence but the opaque wheels of justice simply crank him into death row without a second thought. Morris worked as an investigative journalist in uncovering the man's innocence, made the film, and eventually got his conviction overturned because of its persuasiveness. Scenes of the crime are reconstructed and dramatized by Morris to fill in the point of view of the interviewee (not to demonstrate the truth), and the film gradually and compellingly puts together the missing fragments of the case, and turns truth on its backside.

At least in 1976 Dallas. To me there are two main aspects to what happened. There must have been an initial motive to go after Randall Adams instead of David Harris, and then, once he was made the main suspect, there had to be some explanation to why he is convicted, despite almost everything pointing in the other direction.Adams was 28, whereas lil' David was 16. The movie pointed out that this would've been enough, since only Adams was eligible for death. In addition, and perhaps more important, David was from Vidor, Texas, whereas Adams was from out of state.There is something else that, even though is never talked about, must have been in people's minds.I first thought it hard to understand why a 28 year old would spend an evening with a 16 year old. Moreover, after it was clear that David had guns and even had shot some rounds in the air, Adams still goes with him to a drive-in movie, which included a soft-core feature (albeit a heterosexual one). They also talk about the possibility of David spending the night in the same hotel, which does not materialize because Adams' brother did not like 'those things'. Even after this is made clear, David still hangs around a bit, and Adams, leaning on the car, says he can help out, and offers to try to get him a job. Some viewers believed Adams was in the car during the shooting (because the story about the rounds shot in the air?). No witness claims to have seen two people in the car. David, however, says he slid in his seat when the officer came to the car. This would put him in a rather awkward position, if you follow my thoughts. It's hard to gauge how important this was, but I'd take a wild guess that Dallas is not exactly a gay-friendly city.As for how this eventually only got worse, a few things caught my attention. The prosecutor's perfect record was not to be stained by this case; the first female officer on duty was not to have such a bad start, despite her obvious incompetence; and finally the life of a (texan) 16 year old boy was not to be ruined, as put by one of the police officers, even though he was the obvious suspect. Unfortunately, as Adams himself hints at, these have nothing to do with who was actually likely to have committed the crime.At some point in the movie, an officer makes the remark that never had it taken so long for a cop-killing to be resolved. One can only wonder how many similar stories didn't make it to the big screen.As a closing remark, I found Adams' interpretation of 'a rolling stone gathers no moss' a bit weird.

Most documentaries, today, seem to follow on this same path. Well, at least the good ones do. What gave the film such a non-fictional feel to it were the on camera interviews and the actually shots of the characters written statements; the confession, the newspaper clippings, and court information. It was that hard evidence that grabbed the viewer and threw him in to the documentary. Also, I enjoyed how the characters were placed in front of the camera to help show they were conducting an interview. Even though no questions were asked to them, the audience could still get the feeling that they were being prosecuted right then and there. There were also elements to the story that gave it more of a Hollywood feel. This would be the reenactment of the shooting and other parts of the night. It was the overall style of how it was filmed that gave it this tone. They transitioning of different car brands, two different vehicles seemed to dissolve in to each other and the zooming in on the license plate and rear lights. Also, the over-dramatic slow motion close up of the milk shake seemed very Hollywood. I have not viewed many documentaries outside of the ones from class, the ones I have seen are mostly sports related. I am not very familiar with the troubled conviction of old school documents. To me, The Thin Blue Line seemed to fit with the other documents that I have seen. However, I did find The Thin Blue Line to be very manipulative and deceiving.

In almost every instance, Dr. Grigson would, after examining a defendant, testify that he had found the individual in question to be an incurable sociopath, who it was one hundred per cent certain would kill again.This lead Morris to find an example, Adams, where this incurable sociopath status was in doubt. But we also still have that critique of Grigson -- we see what he said about Adams, a man with no history of criminal acts or violence, after only fifteen minutes with him.This change in focus lead to a better film, most likely (though Erroll Morris has an incredible track record for good documentaries). We now get to see a wider picture of eyewitness testimony, the prejudice of the area (which includes a thriving KKK) and more.Adams' case was reviewed and he was released from prison approximately a year after the film's release.

How does it all fit together, as the stories of the suspects obviously don't match? A private investigator himself at the time, Morris poses the right questions to everyone involved - Adams himself, Harris, the guy he hitched a ride from, the police, various detectives, witnesses, the attorneys. He also illustrates their versions on how the killing happened with contradicting re-enactments, usually a clear no-go for documentaries. Morris didn't know better what was expected of him at the time, but presenting the material cinematically - with close-ups, slow-motion and a haunting score by Phillip Glass - leaves a huge impact. However, except from his editing process, Morris lets the impressions stand as they are before the viewer without commenting himself. The result is intense and involving, spine-tingling, gripping and grizzly, and the last images will leave you shell-shocked and speechless. Criminals always lie, you know. Innocents usually tell the truth. Police should have an inkling in this regard.The riveting story of Randall Adams and David Harris doesn't end with the film.

But ones that make you better for the knowledge that comes from taking in their ordeals.Randall Adams was in Texas in late 1976 and David Harris grew up in Vidor, a town in the Eastern part of the state. They met up and both lives were permanently altered. Officer Robert Wood was fatally gunned down in November of that year and his murder then became the longest to solve police force homicide in Dallas history. Somebody had to pay.Adams, a man whose biggest crime was probably smoking a little pot now and then, found himself on trial for the death. Harris was a minor and couldn't be executed even if he was tried and found guilty. Adams was convicted and spent over a decade incarcerated until this film told the world his (and Harris') story. The case eventually reached the US Supreme Court and they returned an 8-1 verdict in Adams' favour (the only dissenter being William Renquist).After being exonerated years later, Adams wrote the great book Adams vs Texas, highly recommended to anyone who wants a more detailed account from Randall's perspective. Harris was executed by lethal injection for another murder in the state that has more capital punishment stats than any other (over 400 in the last 30 years).The death penalty is something most people, if only a small majority, believe in. Except for extreme examples (Tim McVeigh, Richard Ramirez, Ted Bundy and their ilk), maybe life with no chance of parole is a more sensible alternative.

Second, and interleaved with those interviews, there are numerous re-enactments of the actual murder (using actors), but from different perspectives, reminding this viewer of two things eyewitnesses cannot be trusted absolutely, and the fictional story Rashomon (1950), from Akira Kurosawa, which presented the same story from three different points of view.This pure doco mixed with re-enactment works well to illustrate visually what somebody had just finished saying, thus allowing the viewer to integrate the story fully, or as fully as can be done, within.Gradually, the viewer is lead to a conclusion the wrong man was imprisoned for the murder. And the murderer, in turn, carried on for a number of years with a life of crime until justice caught up with him.

Its  also a moment frozen in time, a  time when racism still shaped the  judicial system and the good old  boy system extended further than  politics. The score by Phillip Glass  was also amazing. There are so  many little indicators of the individual's  personalities within the film,  sometimes it appears comical or  scary. Quite an achievement for  a film which is so confined and  claustrophobic.

Morris is a filmmaker who is said to have despised all verite and as a result has abandoned all characteristics attributed to that style. Specifically, there is no feel of spontaneity or immediacy in his films, absolutely no hand-held shots, and no presenting of extra information. You can tell there is not a shooting ratio of 150-2001 as with say a typical Frederick (High School) Wiseman film. It is precisely this rejection which makes The Thin Blue Line so compelling.The Thin Blue Line is a documentary about the wrongful arrest and subsequent conviction of a man whom hitched a ride with the wrong man at the wrong time. His story is told through a series of interviews, including one from the jailed man himself, inter-cut throughout various reenactments of the disputed crime. Morris presents us with a very dark film filled with high contrast lighting and cool blues which give all the subjects a pale look. It is, however, with the reenactments that this documentary stands out. Morris's use of slow-motion photography, close ups, and editing focuses your attention on specific aspects of the crime scene as well as the aesthetic value of these traditionally narrative tools.This film's most impressive aspect is the haunting score by Phillip Glass, which immediately encapsulates you from the first second we are introduced to Dallas, Texas. The score tends to play out during reenactments and through crucial aspects of the interviews which narrow our attention to the message of the film. This score can put you into a kind of trance which makes you completely open to manipulation.It is this manipulation however which reminds you of the limitations of the narrative documentary. We are absolutely told what to think about the people (police and witnesses) whom do not support the claims of the jailed man. Morris intended to make a film about the wrongful conviction of this man and any of the interviewees who got in the way of that were either trivialized or their stories were manipulated as to only present arguments of the innocence of this man. But who cares, of course we are being manipulated by the narrative structure, it is still damned compelling.

His documentary style is unique and feels almost clinical. He is a master at sorting through factual information and reconstructing events for the viewer.Randall Adams was caught up in the aggressive, eager-to-kill-anyone justice system in Texas. No American state has killed as many people as Texas. In The Thin Blue Line we witness an out-of-control system which puts people to death so aggressively you wonder how many innocent people who have been murdered by prosecutors in Texas. Since the release of Randall Adams, others have been shown to have been innocent, but Mr. Adams' case shed light on the system which prefers to murder its mistakes rather than admit fault.Not every convict has the advantage of a brilliant filmmaker who takes up his case. Here, the flaws of the case were so glaring and obvious that the state was embarrassed. This is a great documentary. It is influential viewing, and it changed the fate of a poor convict who had was nearly put to death on several occasions.When Mr. Morris puts the case together, we see that the state wanted to kill an innocent man, and they would have succeeded if Errol Morris had not investigated the facts.

The problem with that analogy is that, in the Kurosawa film, one has no basis by which to know which of the several versions of the killing are correct. In The Thin Blue Line- both from the many tellings and the way Morris presents them, it's obvious that Adams is innocent and Harris is guilty. The only Rashomon like thing is the fact that re-enacted tellings of the shooting all vary, from the two principals, to the cops' claims, to those made by the assorted witnesses who, in actuality, saw nothing. The fact that the many re-enactments are at odds with Morris's clear view that Adams was innocent is a minor failing of the film, and shows Morris was still trying to live up to the dictum that a documentary has to be (or try to be) objective in its presentation of its facts. But, in a case where the evidence is so incontrovertibly one-sided, is such an effort worth it, dramatically or aesthetically? I think not, and films like Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, USA are proof of my claim. The title of the film comes from the old notion that a thin line of cops (hence the blue) is all that saves civilization from its own worst instincts. The judge who sentenced Adams, when recounting the summation of the DA, tells how he almost teared up at hearing the use of the term. The film, however, turns the title on its side and shows how that same line can be used as a tool for injustice, suppression of evidence, and the oppression of innocents. And it is this perversion of 'justice' that can hasten society's fall far more than the mere absence of that thin blue line.The Thin Blue Line is both a landmark and important film, but those claims are not equivalent to calling it a great film. Arguments can be made, in which case a claim for near greatness may be apt, but not greatness. Compared to the documentaries of Morris's friend and mentor, Werner Herzog, The Thin Blue Line still has a far greater affinity to the sort of straightforward documentaries to be found on PBS shows like Frontline. However, the fact that it did great things- freed an innocent man and held up the so-called justice system to the greater scrutiny it deserves (be it for capital crimes or those as trivial as phony traffic tickets issued to meet monthly quotas)- is indisputable, and that makes it an important film. From a cinematic perspective, the best thing this still rather linear film did was bridge Morris's path from his early quirky documentaries to his later, greater films, like The Fog Of War, which is more clearly in the Herzogian mode. And, for that trajectory, alone, the world of cinema should be grateful. "},{"Title":"moves, responds and makes an audience think about the nature of lying and truth","Date":"8 October 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Crime, Drama","Review":" I'm reminded of something that Pauline Kael wrote about the film Goodfellas, how it it was something like 'journalism with the brio of drama', while watching The Thin Blue Line. Because if there's one documentary I can think of where the documentarian does not really take any kind of stance on either side, but at the same time shows the material in a way to really get the audience interested in the material aside from the usual aesthetics on hand for the filmmaker, it's this one. Director Errol Morris, who also directed the film the Fog of War, before made this film about a murder case set in the dingy, suspicious, and dastardly sections of small-town Texas. It's kind of like a docu-noir in a way, with a little of the Coens' Blood Simple seeping into the atmosphere, and the air of something rotten in Denmark going all over the Adams/Harris murder case. It has the storytelling bravado of Rashomon, only done in the right way as opposed to the countless other retreads of that film. Here Morris gets all the different points of view, but only this time the storytelling really does have to amount to something, and it does. If nothing else it's a low-key masterpiece in the art of storytelling.The low-down; Adams is picked up by Harris one morning (err, afternoon depending on the story), they hang out, party a little, see some cheerleader flicks at a drive-in (which re-created for the film are very funny), and then the stories diverge where the murder of a police officer is claimed as being Harris by one story (or rather, not knowing what happened), and Adams being the driver of the car/shooter in another. Morris assembles interviews with the two of them- and if going by a subjective view-point (and, to a point even, by an objective view-point of records and even personality- one can see where personality, history and just the attitudes and directness with the camera and interviewer show who's side of the story SHOULD have been taken into account or not. He also assembles interviews with witnesses, the female cop on duty that night, the lawyers, and this all makes up really one of three parts to Morris's aesthetic.The second part is close-up clips of newspaper clippings and certain shots of buildings, which is recognizable if one has already seen Fog of War. The third though, which is what adds further substance- and of course style- to the first part are the re-enactments, chiefly of the murder scene. It may be significant to point out that Morris was for a short time a private detective. These scenes, and I would guess too how the interviews are put together and edited, show Morris as someone both after the truth of the recollections, but also how perceptions end up changing the story, which adds to the bravura re-enactments where we see the shooting of the cop from several angles. Little stories though too, like the Dillinger story from the woman, further illustrate something deeper in the material that Morris might have not been searching out. What is is about human beings that some can be very understanding, sympathetic, helpful, or just cold-factual, and others to border on sadistic and just nuts? Two of the latter examples could go to the DA who had no intention of wanting to know guilt or innocence on Adams's part, just that he should die, and also the doctor (doctor death) who went on for two and a half hours comparing Adams to Hitler.I'm not sure, and I don't think it would be close to a point, that Morris is after something about the death penalty. Morris is after the facts, and as such he got them together so well that Adams got exonerated after the release of the picture. But there's also that sense of heightening life, and these character's lives, even through the seemingly too straight-forward shots of the interviewees. Like a private dick- and maybe this was something that added to the personality of the picture for Morris- he doesn't really want b.s., and it shows when someone at the least seems like they're not telling the truth, like the woman who was so much into private detective shows that she probably got too big for her britches, so to speak, when she pointed Adams out. In the end all of this is detailing of a murder case, a profiling of two men amidst people who wanted to help, eternally condemn, or were on the sidelines not knowing what was up or down with Adams and Harris. And the two of them make for interesting cases as well, as Harris's early life gets some insight. And after a while, even if one might have a firm grasp on what is or what should be the truth, what stands out more is the unique way the stories are put together, and the very act of perspective and reflection and how that in and of itself becomes inherently dramatic.It's one of the best documentaries, or rather 'non-fiction' films, I have ever seen.

Oh boy how wrong I was. From the first second you hear the music running and you see the captions An Errol Morris Film, you immediately get the sense that you are in for something good.

Along with the reenactments, the movie has an extremely surreal experience to it. Unlike 99% of documentaries, Errol Morris eludes to have narration, instead he lets the people say what's one their minds. In my opinion this is more effective because you get to hear the truth and not assumptions by the narrator trying to impose excessive remarks. I mentioned reenactments, let me explain how they work in Errol Morris movies. According to what the people on camera might be saying, Errol Morris tries to recreate those situations. This adds a very strange feel to the documentary experience. Even though you know these reenactments never occurred as they are shown, it helps you understand what the people are talking about. Furthermore it adds to the whole logic of seeing a movie, it makes it more artistic and more film-like. Another interesting feature Errol Morris uses is footage from movies, or cartoons. I have never seen these elements in a documentary. I was astonished by what I saw in this documentary. At every single second of the film, it keeps your attention intact.

From director Errol Morris, this film documents and reconstructs the night of November 29th 1976, when during a traffic stop in Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood was murdered, the Dallas Police Department could only make an arrest after a sixteen year old Vidor, Texas resident gave information that he had told friends he was responsible for the crime. Young David Ray Harris did lead the police to the car driven from the scene of the crime and the 22 Short calibre revolver identified as the murder weapon, and the murderer was identified as twenty eight year old Ohio resident and hitchhiker Randall Dale Adams, who was living in a Dallas motel with his brother at the time. With the series of interviews from all involved in the investigation and re-enactments of the night in question, including witnesses, detectives and from Adams and Harris, and two attorneys make the case that more evidence points towards juvenile Harris then Adams who claims to be innocent and could face death under Texas law. The title of the film comes from a prosecutor comment that the police are the thin blue line separating society from anarchy, also something to do with a poem by Rudyard Kipling and the colour of police uniform and their formation. Before watching this film I read that this film, made twelve years since the crime was committed, received a much more meaningful accolade than winning an Oscar or any other awards, following the release of the film the investigation was reignited and the case taken back to court, and the sentence for Adams was reversed. It is great to hear that a film could be so informative and force a retrial and the law to rethink their decision and verdict on a crime, Adams was indeed proved an innocent man and wrongly accused while Harris was executed with lethal injection in 2004 (for another unrelated crime). This is an engaging enough real life story about a murder and the routines of law enforcement and the legal system, the editing of going from interviews to re-enactments is well put together, and with some provocative stuff you do get a sense of unease sometimes, a terrific documentary.

While the evidence against the man was tenuous, at best, the prosecutors had a much more logical case against a young punk--who was also THE witness against the defendant! So, the only solid evidence was provided by a man who was clearly guilty--of course the guy would lie and blame someone else! Yet, oddly, there was such a rush to get a conviction--and a death penalty conviction--that an innocent man was imprisoned.I have enjoyed several of Errol Morris' other documentary films (such as MR. DEATH and FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL) though I must also admit that a few of his films left me very cold (especially VERNON Florida). THE THIN BLUE LINE is his greatest film in many ways. First, because unlike many documentaries, this one provoked action. People saw this film where Morris was trying to make positive social change...and WHAM, it happened! This is something almost all other documentaries cannot hope to achieve. Because of this film, a wrongly convicted man was released from prison. Second, like MR. DEATH, this film was a major improvement over many of his earlier films because it kept a very tight focus. The subject matter was clear and the film was a logical presentation of the facts. Third, the combination of music, interviews and recreations really worked together well--showing immense skill on his part. It just doesn't get any better than this.Amazingly, although this wonderfully made film saved an innocent man, this guy later sued Morris!!

Through some questionable witnesses Adams was sentenced to a life term but Morris interviews him and Harris as well as the witnesses as he tries to tell what really happened. THE THIN BLUE LINE is about as perfect as a documentary can get and a lot of credit must go to Morris for the style he brought to the story. Not only do we get interviews for the majority of those involved, the director also adds some re-enactments and I really loved how he used newspaper listings to back up certain parts of the story. Just one example of this is that the men went to see a drive-in movie and Morris shows up the advertisement from the paper showing that the movies were playing. The real drama comes from the fact that everything seems to say that Adams is innocent and the only reason he was brought to trial was because people were lying. Just hearing from the witnesses as they talk about the lies they're telling is something so tense that you really couldn't get the same level of suspense from a made up movie. Knowing that real lives were involved in the story just makes it all the more personal and all the more dramatic.
