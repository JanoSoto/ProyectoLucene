The film has you on the edge of your seat as the plot unravels,and truths are discovered about sweet little Darian Forrester who is crazier than anyone thought.Her anger at Nick for leading her on goes to the extreme until she comes up with a plan she hopes will destroy his reputation.Nick is oblivious to Darian's feelings for him and believes its nothing more than a silly school girl crush that will pass until he discovers just how dangerous Darian really is.

It's slow at first. It's not suspenseful but it efficiently uses the short time of action to punch you with thrills. My adrenaline was rushing when Amy got stung by wasps. The direction is so precise that a certain number of seconds can leave you hanging off the sofa. Be careful if you're eating popcorn(or potato chips). You might end up drooling your food on the floor. Nick isn't that smart but I like him because he's nobody's fool.

However her advances are so strong that after a while he is left dazed, as she accuses him of sexual abuse and has the police arrest him.Destined to clear his name for good, he embarks on a mission to expose her crush - and prove to everyone once and for all that she's a psychopath.A lot of movies like this were made back in the '80s and '90s starting with Fatal Attraction, although this is one of the more entertaining ones. As far as the acting goes, Silverstone is very sexy (she was older than 14 during filming so I can say this without coming across as a perv) - she's good at playing a devious flirt.Elwes experiments with his off-again-on-again American accent and the good news is that it's more convincing here than in Saw (2004). Except for a few scenes, he pretty much sounds convincing. His acting is up to par as well.It's not a great movie but it's entertaining, which is exactly what it should be.

Re-watching this movie, I didn't realize that maybe it wasn't that great of a movie like I had remembered. It was a pretty unoriginal plot, didn't add much of it's own taste or style and was pretty silly over the top. But still I'm not going to diss the film entirely, this was the beginning of Alicia Silverstone's career and she pulls in a strong performance and was very chilling on screen with Cary Elwes. The story may not be original but Alicia and Cary made the story work.Arriving in a new city, writer Nick Eliot secures a job at Pique magazine and lodgings in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester. Nick soon makes the acquaintance of the Forrester's 14-year-old daughter Adrian, a precocious gifted girl who develops an intense attraction to him. She secretly helps Nick by sneaking into his room and rewriting one of his Pique stories, which subsequently wins a rave from his editor/boss Michael. At a party thrown by the Forresters, Nick agrees to accompany the lonely girl on a nightly drive to a romantic spot, where she kisses him. This intensifies Adrian's crush on Nick, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off, having begun a budding romance with co-worker Amy. Adrian continues to boldly pursue him, even going so far as to undress in his view. Nick, however, continues to rebuff her advances, and Adrian's actions become destructive, she smashes a car he's restored and erases his computer discs with his work on it. Then, after Adrian spies on Amy in bed with Nick, you thought Adrian was crazy before, just wait to see what happens next.Over all The Crush is a decent enough movie to watch, I wouldn't dismiss it completely, just if you catch it on TV, check it out. I thought that the scene where Cary is hiding in Alicia's closet to find out what she's really been up too and she knows that he is there, so instead of freaking out, she just undresses in front of him with a seductive look. Also where you see that she has beaten herself up just to get back at Cary's character was very chilling. The Crush has good moments, but it is flawed and in my opinion there are some scenes that could have had a little more, like the hornets that Alicia uses to attack Cary's girlfriend with, afterwards in the hospital, she really doesn't look that injured. But it's mindless entertainment, the new twist on Fatal Attraction, so if you dig these thrillers then The Crush is right up your alley.5/10 "},{"Title":"A Lolita from hell","Date":"28 March 2007","Score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" This was Alicia Silverstone's debut film after which she went on to star in some Aerosmith videos (what red-blooded American male can ever forget seeing her and Liv Tyler in Crazy?) after which she got the lead in Clueless (1995) and the rest is cinematic history.In Clueless of course she was a sweet, adorable and slightly empty-headed Valley Girl. Here she is what might be called a Lolita from hell. Director Alan Shapiro even has her do a Sue Lyon (from Kubrick's 1964 Lolita) looking-over-her-sunglasses imitation to start the film. We soon learn that she is 14 almost 15. (Silverstone was actually 15-years-old during the filming.) She is also rich and very talented, plays a classical piano, knows the scientific names of beetles and wasps, has skipped two grades, etc. The film itself might be dubbed a kind of Fatal Attraction for teeny-boppers.Cary Elwes plays Nick Eliot who is looking for some digs as the film begins. He is a writer who just got a gig with an important, trendy magazine. After nearly bumping into Adrian (Silverstone) with his car, he looks askance and sees a sign advertising a cottage for rent in back of a large house with estate. Turns out this is where Adrian lives with her parents.Somehow this reminds me of William Holden as the writer Joe Gillis pulling into that driveway on Sunset Boulevard (1950). He should have looked in the other direction! He should have run the other way! When Little Miss Crazy gets a crush, it is a hum-dinger. Maybe Nick should have just surrendered at the start and she would have been bored with him in a couple of months at most. But unfortunately, Nick Eliot is the epitome of the clueless male. He doesn't see the danger until it is too late. He is slightly compromised because he has kissed her, he has wandered about her house when her parents haven't been at home, and worse yet he doesn't have an inkling of the strength of her passion. To be honest I felt a little sorry for her having to deal with all that rejection! I think this would have played more realistically had Adrian's part been given to an ugly little shrew in the making. But then of course the film would not have found any kind of audience.Well, this is a familiar premise and the kind I like to see worked out and resolved--well, I like to look at Alicia, anyway. Unfortunately Alan Shapiro, who also wrote the script, has the originality of a photocopy machine and just milks the premise while mindlessly escalating the bizarro. Suffice it to say that Little Miss Crazy doesn't take no for an answer and that Nick stupidly behaves in a way that just makes his situation worse. The ending does have the virtue of being nicely ironic while suggesting the hoped-for sequel.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

I'm currently watching it for the second time, and, the nuances of Nick's character are very very interesting. Nick is not, contrary to how his actions could be construed, an absolute idiot... In many ways, particularly in the beginning, Nick seems to allow himself to be manipulated by Adrian, and on some level, he IS physically attracted to her. His character is not quite as obvious as I thought originally. Also, I (unlike some other viewers) didn't find Adrian's character to be completely unbelievable (perhaps because I'm a teenage girl, and I know how evil we can be. *snickers* There's not an age requirement to be a sociopath.) Secondly, Cary Elwes. Admittedly, this character as written, has little depth beyond that of the victim, and although he played the role very well ,(his delivery was what kept the character from being TOTALLY boring)the plot line was simply too obvious... There weren't any plot twists, which kept the film from being truly suspenseful beyond the whole WTF??? You IDIOT!!! Can't you see she's EVIL?!? Alicia Silverstone's performance was pretty good... but not incredible. I feel that she could have done much more with the role and keeping her character a little more mysterious... As played, it doesn't make much sense that Nick wouldn't have known what was going on earlier.Yeah. Honestly, this plot would have been much more interesting if Nick's character had been less predictable and more flawed, and Adrian had been less obvious. Nonetheless, this is quite an enjoyable flick if for no other reason than to analyze Nick's character and watch Cary Elwes' interesting delivery....Just a small question; Does anyone else think that this is part of what made him decide to start playing the evil roles?

It's absurd, trashy, and utterly laughable. It does have a memorable antagonist in the form of young Alicia Silverstone, who plays Adrian Forrester, a Lolita-ish 14-year-old who develops a serious crush on Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes), the 20-something journalist renting a guest house from her parents (Kurtwood Smith, Gwynyth Walsh). Of course, nobody believes the older man when he protests that the crazed girl is the wrongdoer, and Nick finds his life continuously going awry as she creates one problem after another.Written and directed by Alan Shapiro, this film doesn't exactly have the brightest characters. As a result, you never really root for Nick. Fortunately Silverstone, who'd previously made her name in Aerosmith rock videos, is a total hoot as this deranged gal who does some pretty nasty things to make her crush look bad. And things do indeed look very bad for Nick when she frames him for sexual assault. Elwes does what he can with his obtuse role, while Smith has some choice moments as the dad. Jennifer Rubin looks quite lovely as the photographer whom we know is more appropriate for Nick. And Amber Benson lends some solid support as Adrians' friend who tries to warn Nick about what she knows.The movie *is* well paced and climaxes in one of the more priceless confrontation scenes that you're likely to see in this sort of thing. The ending is actually rather effective in its payoff of the Adrian character.Silverstone may well have had a body double for the nude scenes, but it's still quite uncomfortable when remembering that the character being watched is a mere 14 years old.All in all, The Crush is entertaining if exploitative trash, and should never ever be taken too seriously.Seven out of 10.

Her ability to play the innocent is brought off very well because she conveys a sense of really caring for Nick, within one field of her ambivalence. I do have some problems with the film. Perhaps foremost is Nick's inability to just get the hell out of there. He should have done that much sooner. Or -- was the film suggesting that his fascination with the Silverstone character is keeping him around? That the girl could rewrite Nick's story and improve it strained credulity. The film dropped Nick's professional issues almost completely about a third of the way through. We got no sense of the huge interview he pulled off. That the girl could convince doctors of the event she claimed even having planted evidence struck me as completely impossible. The ending involved a transition to surrealism that the film had not prepared for. It was as if the film were figuring out its stylistic and generic premises as it went along. Why can't filmmakers produce coherent finished products anymore? Is it in response to the post-modernist attack on 'thematic unity' or just plain sloppiness. This could have been a great film.

People want to look at this like it should be realistic, yet it isn't intended to be. It is just your average teen horror fare. The film is about a girl named Darian (or Adrian, whichever you prefer) who meets a handsome older 30 year old Nick Elliot (Cary Elwes) and gets an unhealthy, creepy obsession with him. Darian (played by Alicia Silverstone) is a talented and attractive 14 year old girl who is vulnerable and awkward in her struggles to make friends. Eventually Darian becomes a huge burden and does major damage to Nick's livelihood, causing him to get arrested on suspicion of statuary rape and losing his job. Things work out in the end though serendipitously by some luck by chance.In my opinion, Alicia Silverstone did an excellent job in this movie. For only 16, she played the part well of an insecure teenager, balanced with the role of a young seductive siren trying to make Nick Elliot break the law. You could really see her talent as a young actress which rightfully sprung her into other roles like Clueless(1995), True Crime(1996) and Blast from the Past(1999). Cary Elwes was a lot less impressive with his role and his acting, but he did make a funny pairing with Alicia Silverstone. The movie has many comical and endearing parts to it. Some of it seems exaggerated and unbelievable, like the way he was arrested without proper evidence, the homeowners believing him to be a drug dealer, and him not bothering to call before showing up to their house! You will laugh at the absurdity of these situations most definitely. Overall, it's entertaining, not bad to check out, especially if you are a major Alicia Silverstone fan. It's not bad watching less serious stuff once in a while.

After moving into the guest house of the well-to-do Forresters their only child, 14 year old Adrienne (Alicia Silverstone), develops an increasingly unhealthy crush on him. Jennifer Rubin and Matthew Walker play Nick's girlfriend & boss while Kurtwood Smith and Gwynyth Walsh play Adrienne's parents and Amber Heard her neighbor.This belongs to the Lethal Lolita sub-genre of drama/romance/thrillers. These movies always involve a hot teenager who utilizes her freshly bestowed womanly powers to seduce an older man and create havoc. The Crush is actually better than Stanley Kubrick's revered Lolita (1962), which was the first of its kind (at least the first to popularize the topic anyway). In the early 90s these kinds of movies made a comeback with 1992's Poison Ivy starring Drew Barrymore. The Crush isn't haunting and artsy like Poison Ivy, but it's just as good and arguably marginally better. Poison Ivy has better style while The Crush is more straight-forward, sort of like 1987's Fatal Attraction, but with a teenage antagonist.Speaking of which, Alicia shines here in her cinematic debut. She was only almost-16 during filming, but easily commands attention throughout. Elwes is great as the protagonist with solid support from Rubin.These types of attractions happen all the time in real life (a teenage girl developing a crush on an older guy) and it's the responsibility of the adult to erect and maintain proper boundaries so the situation doesn't spin out of control, like it does here. If the adult lets things go too far the girl will either be so devastated she becomes nigh suicidal, like in 1976's Lifeguard, or she turns malevolently psycho.To me The Crush would've worked better as a bittersweet coming of age drama, like the subplot of Lifeguard, rather than a drama that morphs into thriller bordering on horror, like Fatal Attraction. The first half is strong as a coming-of-age drama before transforming into the latter in the second half with its contrived thriller/horror mechanics. But they didn't ask me to write the script so I accept the movie as is. As a matter of fact, I feel it breaks the threshold of greatness for what it is.The movie runs 89 minutes and was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia.GRADE A- "},{"Title":"Follows the Standard Format","Date":"25 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes) has just moved to Seattle and needs a place to stay prior to working as an investigative journalist for a magazine there.

At first Nick thinks it's just a little crush and that they're only friends. But once Nick finds a girlfriend Amy (Jennifer Rubin), Darian becomes enraged and tries to do away with Amy. And her crush becomes a deadly obsession. She calls Nick several times a day. Comes over to his house unexpectedly. Accuses him of rape and actually gets ahold of one of his used condoms! Which is totally sick. This film isn't scary or frightening, but it does have some creepy and tense moments. One of the most frightening scenes to me was when Darian tried to kill Amy with bees. Amy is in the garage developing pictures and Darian pours dozens of bees into the room and Amy is unable to get out because the door is locked. And it shows Amy's hands and face covered in bees. That was the most frightening and somewhat disturbing scene in the film. Alicia Silverstone was brilliant as Darian in her film debut. She was unbelievably creepy. Cary Elwes was average as Nick Eliot. He's a good actor but he usually chooses roles that don't showcase how much talent he actually has and this was one of those films. You weren't able to feel any sympathy for him because Nick kind of led Darian on. But he was so handsome in this film I thought. This is the film he has looked his best in. Kurtwood Smith was great in a supporting role as Darian's overprotective father. This film isn't award material and is in no way great but it is still highly entertaining and has a couple of edge-of-your-seat moments. I'm glad I have it in my collection. Thank you for reading my review!

The couple's 14-year-old daughter (Alicia Silverstone) takes an interest in the new tenant. At first, the daughter is like a pesky, but cute, cub. Later, as her interest becomes more obsessive, our cute cub morphs into a sneaky and conniving fox. The result is a sinister plot with some nifty suspense.Although she looks older than fourteen, Alicia Silverstone is quite good as the teenage vixen, and is the main reason to see the film. By contrast, Elwes is only marginally effective as Nick, the adult victim.The film's plot, while suspenseful, is full of contrivances. Nick does things that no sensible adult would do in similar situations. For example, he is forever walking into the owner's house, uninvited, and thus setting himself up. But, such action is useful to advance the plot. Other contrivances include beehives and trapdoors. And, the film contains a couple of plot holes that relate to questions of access. Moreover, the lack of character development is conspicuous. And I did not like the film's silly and melodramatic ending, which has a funhouse element to it.Overall, the film is rather average. Its main attraction is the excellent performance by Alicia Silverstone. The film's suspense was enough to hold my attention, throughout. And the production design was fairly lush.On the other hand, the lack of character development and all those plot holes and contrivances rendered a shallow, superficial screen story, helped not at all by a silly ending, and by background music that was irritating and very manipulative.

Fatal Attraction with a fourteen year old.","Date":"11 July 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" I bought this today in a previously enjoyed bin at Blockbuster. It set me back five bucks, so I figured since I like Alicia, this would be worthwhile for my guilty pleasure collection I've been building up over the years (Included in that collection is Excess Baggage, the film that made me get a huge crush on Alicia). Considering the money spent, this is great popcorn. When buying this I expected a pseudo update of Fatal Attraction, which in so many words, was. (spare me if I offend some for making that comparison) The Crush is a campy, but dark story. Alicia plays a very convincing 14 year old obsessive compulsive psychopathic teenager who is experiencing love. I really thought she did well, I know she has limitations - but it's a totally unbiased opinion. You'd never expect the girl from Clueless to say such lines like Hey Nick, ever do a virgin? - She portrays this very sexual presence, which works.My problem with the film is I guess I've sort of marked myself as a fan of the Alicia who plays sweet characters, so it's kind of a knock back. Other than that - If not taken seriously it would make a good film to throw on if you like Alicia, if not, could still be a decent thriller movie to watch with a couple beers or if you just want to throw on a guilty pleasure. It's campy, it's got some corn, but you gotta love it sometimes.

Nick, a journalist, is looking for an apartment in a town where he just moved to. He seems to find the ideal place. A spacious flat rented by a wealthy and seemingly normal family. Daughter of the family is Adrian. She is beautiful, talented and clever. She also has interest in Nick. It is not strange when a girl has interest in an older guy, in this case much older. However, Adrian is a bit different from the girls from her age. She knows what exactly she wants. It is not a smile, or a few flirtatious moment. She wants Nick to fall in love with her. That's the time Nick decides to stop this. Adrian is so dangerous that she does not mind harming people around her and Nick in order to re-win his heart and she is determined to do that in any costs. Okay, we know how dangerous a human being can be. But there are some moments when I thought it was too much. First, a highly qualified journalist writes a piece to be published then a 14 year old girl looks at it, makes a few changes and editor loves it after all those changes. Come on!! You must be kidding. Secondly, she is in Nick flat, knows all hidden corners. So, does she have a spare key? Or is Nick stupid enough to lock the door after what has been happening. Then, Adrian, locks Nick's girlfriend in the photo-editing room and sends all the wasps into the room from ventilation. Again, how does she find out whereabouts she lives. Basically, we have a villain who is 14 years old and victim is helpless. The only person he can get to believe him is his girlfriend. That takes a while too. Acting is average. Not known names as Alicia Silverstone was discovered after filming The Crush. Cary Elwes is always in average movies anyway such as The Shadow of The Vampire, Jungle Book.. I heard that this was a real life story which happened to the director Shapiro. In that case I would feel so sorry for him as he is involved with such a thing at first place and couldn't even pull it off to make it a better film.

That's usually due to the fact that they all follow the same storyline almost verbatim. The Crush was one I'd heard about but not seen and recently had the viewing pleasure.My thoughts On this one are pretty non complex. This is a stalker genre movie that follows many of the same familiar twists and turns and which isn't really very good but which is more watchable then some of the other stalker movies. That is due mainly to two things. One is the dialog. It has been commented on how really out there the dialog is and that's true but that is precisely what makes the movie at all memorable. Every so often there would be a line that was just so unbelievable I would just have to chuckle. And the character of Nick seemed to get a lot of those lines....Second is the casting of Alicia Silverstone. I have to admit, mediocre movie or not, She was really very good and managed to created a memorable character. There are other movies of this type I have watched including Poison Ivy, single white female and most recently Swim Fan and though none of them are very good, and though this isn't really very good either, it's better then the above mentioned three. Silverstone actually gives her character a personalty and makes her believable though she hardly looks fourteen! The story line however was the same as so many others though this was, believe it or not, less violent then many of it's genre so that's a plus. I will say that this isn't a 1 or 2 and it IS watchable though I do wish just once or twice a movie in this category would come out and be a bit different. Probably though, people who like movies of this type and haven't checked this one out, should because it's better then some of the others they may have checked out. At any rate- my vote's 4 of 10.

Nick didn't help himself from getting Adrian out of his hair and him into her fantasy world by renting an apartment from her parents Cliff & Liv Forrester, Kurtwood Smith & Gwynwth Walsh, that he thought would give him all the peace & quite that he needed to do his work.

"},{"Title":"Fatiguing, embarrassing rubbish","Date":"8 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Seduction (or so) by the assumed lesser of course, this issue's many aspects deserve as well serious as dramatic picturization. This movie is none of both.Alicia Silverstone appears well-casted. The not really smart but defiant, cunning and tricky character seems to fit her. Perhaps her exterior helps her plausibility, especially those remains of baby fat - on her up-curled upper lip baring rosy gums above those tiny upper teeth, on her unstructured overhands above unshaped child fingers, or on her rounded baby feet. Sure, the physical exterior itself carries no personality traits, but how penetratingly she leverages her frailties for seductive aims is working beyond attractiveness norms and below the boundaries of the subconscious - if only a properly naive target mammal insists on stumbling in front of her cross-hair. For her alleged intention is most lumpishly obvious.The bothersome boring effect this exaggerated performance has on me does not yet mean this can never happen. But it raises the question if our still male dominated society needs such embarrassing poor male chauvinist excusing screen operas showing us how perfidious Lolitas lurk out there in that frightening real life. To be serious, if such a rare constellation really occurs (independent of the gender configuration), than the much more interesting aspects are (a) in which way the younger person, no matter how much in formal control of what's going on, is (even unconsciously) over-strained both mentally and emotionally, and (b) what on earth (except the fluke to receive a seemingly willing, even demandingly self-offering victim) lets the elder person be taken by such an ostensible play.In this sense, Cary Elwes to some extent may be seen as likewise well-casted. His enormous lack of mimic expression fits Nick's naive, or rather excruciatingly stupid character quite well. His eyes tell he sort of expects permanent proof for his self-confidence, yet almost everything he experiences turns out so overwhelmingly unbelievable that he can't even decide if it's frightening, exciting, or just terribly puzzling. Anyway, as this happens frequently, his inner will to survive prevents him from being scared to death by learning to get a kick out of it. The result is visible even when the exerted brows above his permanently bewildered eyes try to prevent anger, the corners of his mouth undecidedly oscillate between fear and a childishly lustful sort of joy. In fact, what we see rather appears to be how Mr. Elwes on each single day of the shooting again experiences the sensation of really having found his way onto a movie set. It can be seen often in unexperienced supernumeraries' faces the amazement that at the most allows attempts of ... playing to play.But how come Nick is introduced as skilled investigative journalist? Who only moments later is told by a 14 yo girl how easily informations this Mr. Pulitzer Jr. regards totally out of his reach can be obtained? These two alleged parts of one personality hardly apply - except to the dissonant concept of excusing a human mammal's misbehavior as consequences of allegedly having fallen prey to the wicked skills of one of those myriads of killer Lolita monsters out there. Boo.

As Nick starts to work, Darian is a nice distraction with her teenage teasing; but when she rewrites Nick's work and submits it as his, he realises that he has to nip it in the bud &#150; although trying to stop it at this point is more difficult than he imagined as Darian, like LL Cool J, clearly has more than a Crush.With such an obvious plot I didn't have high hopes for this film but it seemed to start well enough with a nice bit of charm to it that supported the flirty nature of the lead character. Even at this stage though it as just OK and quite enjoyable but, as with all this sort of film, it very quickly gets down to the business of bunny boiling. As it starts to do this it loses credibility (what little it had) and just becomes a quick succession of scenes where Darian goes nuts. It is nothing special and gradually gets more and more tiresome due to the lack of anything original or interesting about it. By the time everyone starts throwing each other about in the attic I started to wonder what I had really expected this film to do, came up with the answer nothing and noted that it had delivered just that. Knowing just where the plot is going takes a lot out of it and nothing in it makes up for this.The cast match the ambitions of the material by not being anything special. Elwes is hardly leading man material and isn't convincing at all; he cannot get close to the sort of emotions that should have come out of his situation and he is basic, if serviceable, throughout. Silverstone is quite impressive in her debut and, despite being very obvious, she wasn't afraid to own the film. A less kind viewer might note that she is really just doing a Fatal Attraction copy in fast forward but I'm not&#133;.no, actually I'm not kind &#150; that is just what she is doing. Support from Rubin, Smith and others is so-so but really nobody in the cast can claim much from this.Overall an obvious movie that follows the usual Fatal Attraction clichés right down to the screaming finale. As with many of this genre (is it a genre now?) the lack of material results in overblown stalking scenes and a bit screaming conclusion &#150; none of which is engaging and gradually just gets tiresome. Might serve some as mindless junk food for a Friday night but there are many films that cover the same ground and cover it better. "},{"Title":"Memorable stalker suspense.

Of course, you knew from the beginning that it would probably end up like that, and before you know it, you've pushed the memory almost entirely out of your head, once again. Yes, there is a good amount of talents involved in this film, and I quickly recognized Cary Elwes, who I've also seen in Liar Liar, Bram Stoker's Dracula and Robin Hood Men in Tights, and Kurtwood Smith, who I only know from the original RoboCop, where he played Clarence Boddicker. Of course I recognized Alicia Silverstone as well, but I already knew she was in the film, as I had seen her in one film before seeing The Crush the first time(can't remember which, though). The plot is pretty much a rehash of Lolita, with the tables turned to provide mainstream cliché thriller, in the vein of films like The Hand That Rocks The Cradle. The pacing is daft. The acting is decent, but one would expect better from Elwes and Silverstone(then again, it was her first film... still, we don't see any of the talent that she proved she had in later films). I suspect it's the directors fault. Misdirection, or simply bad direction, can ruin a lot. The characters are the usual clichés and stereotypes of the thriller-genre. The film lacks any real thrills, and relies entirely on the typical formula of this type of thrillers(the psycho-close-to-the-lead(s)-tries-to-kill-him/her/them). The film has no surprises and is thoroughly predictable. All in all, the film has no real purpose, apart from seeing Cary Elwes and Kurtwood Smith in different roles(from what I've seen them in, at least). I recommend it purely to big fans of any of the three actors and very big fans of thrillers.

Although it has been ten years, and I have watched the movie a few times since its premiere, I have yet to see the version, or the director's cut that included the pool scene which many people argue exist. In the 2 minute coming attraction, there was a small 2 second clip of Alicia Silverstone and Cary Elwes splashing in the neighbors pool. This scene is never shown in any version. If you recall, Cary Elwes does ask Alicia Silverstone about the neighbors pool, but the conversation goes nowhere as it cuts from that scene to the very next day. In my opinion, I feel that the original version had the Cary Elwes character joining Darian for a midnight skinny dip as friends. I believe it was later cut out to give Cary's character more sympathy as Darian becomes more and more crazy. Having left the scene in would do less for the Cary Elwes role as the innocent victim and more or a single male up to no good.Please respond back if you remember seeing this small clip in the original coming attraction. I want to make sure I didn't dream this up or that I may be losing my mind.

It steals from almost every stalker movie without being energetic or entertaining.  The Crush(1993) is a violent film minus any substancial violence.  This is the only time that I can remember where the stalker does not get killed.  Alicia Silverstone at times overacts, but does a decent job overall.  The director seems to be going through the motions with this film.  Its a bad mixture of Fatal Attraction(1987) & Lolita(1962).  Cary Elwes does a bad job as Nick Elliot as his character behaves like a fool and a sap.  The more Alicia Silverstone's career moves along the more she's likely to forget a film like this.

The Crush all the more proves that you don't really need an intelligent idea or a well-plotted story as long as you've got an attractive actress to play the lead-role&#133; Especially not when you manage to convince the audience that she's only 14 years old, but with the curves of an irresistible bikini-model. This is yet another fancy-looking thriller that combines the success of Stanley Kubrick's Lolita with the typical 'lethal-beauty' premise of Fatal Attraction, and the result is a very routine and forgettable chiller with depthless characters and predictable situations. The only trump here is a gorgeous Alicia Silverstone in her debut as the obsessive stalker-girl Darian, who takes an unhealthy interest in the new tenant of her parents' studio. He &#150; an untalented writer &#150; politely turns down her approaches, but this only makes her more aggressive and determined. It doesn't take long before unpleasant things start to happen to the writer and his girlfriend but, of course, nobody suspects the cherubic Darian of being responsible. Cary Elwes' acting is downright awful and he makes Silverstone look like she's Oscar material, even though her performance is mediocre at best. The story moves very slow and doesn't dare to go controversial. Shapiro has the opportunity to insert the taboo-topic of sex with minors but he reluctantly avoids it, like he was already afraid of receiving negative remarks before his film is even released. All the talking about Wuthering Heights is really boring and the only few action sequences are very tame. The ending of this film is overly weird and misfit and involves a wild carrousel-ride in the attic&#133;or something like that. The supportive roles are decent, with Kurtwood Smith (Robocop) as Silverstone's unaware dad and Jennifer Rubin (Bad Dreams) as the writer's girlfriend.

Currently playing on my TV is The Crush starring Cary Elwes and Alicia Silverstone. She's a psychotic 14 year old stalker, he's the attractive guy made to look dopey with big dumb glasses and bad hair who is renting the summer house behind her parent's place. Silverstone plays Darian Adrian, who is one of those villains who manages to know and see everything and be everywhere at exactly the right time. For example, Nick's (Elwes) girlfriend walks in the woods to find sticks and Adrian is there. I wonder how long she had been there, hoping to find her and frighten her with her terrifying knowledge of wasps?And Nick is the kind of hero who does what the plot demands so that Adrian can trap him before the end. At one point, I gave up on him entirely as a hopeless dork who deserved what Adrian put him through. He actually goes into her home when it is empty to look for a photo he thinks she has taken. He then walks into her bedroom -- will it be empty for long? Is he the dumbest man to walk the earth? Maybe. After all, he has new locks installed, determines to move out, then has sex with his girlfriend in the summer house where he KNOWS Adrian can get to him, and leaves the door unlocked. Yeah. I can't help watching these wretched movies. Loved it.Beware the wasps...they attack in groups....

This film is perhaps the nth of its kind... fatal attraction for a person and its associated problems. Wonky lips Alicia impresses in her debut movie. But the film, in itself, is full of gaps and plot holes. Deserted rooms full of burning candles.. wow. No doubt that Adrienne lit them.. but what about the fire hazard, in a building with wooden walls and floors? And how did the candles remain lit? Surely they would exhaust after sometime? The girlfriend, Amy, gets stung by a bunch of bees, suffocates and almost dies. Adrienne's mischief once again. But the hero kind of forgets to visit her in the hospital. Amy reappears at the end, looking as fit and fine as she was.. no change in her appearance. Good. Should I reveal more plot holes? OK... Adrienne's friend, Cheyenne, is about to be killed, tied to a carousel. Our hero is hell bent on rescuing her. But when she is finally discovered, our hero is more concerned about the welfare of the troublemaker, Adrienne.. poor Cheyenne remains tied. I am not sure how she was rescued at the end.Hmmm.. now I am bored. So let the next viewer report more plot holes. It is a pity that no movie has ever been made on Daisy Duck. Alicia, without any prosthetic makeup, would have been a dead ringer for the role. With perhaps Chris Sarandon as Donald. But forget all that and enjoy Alicia's pout in this debut film. Its her film all the way.

Pretty much your run o' the mill Poison Ivy/ Fatal Attraction-type thriller by the numbers, but hey, we've seen it all before (and done better) so why watch this version I hear you ask? Well, firstly, I was pretty tempted by the idea of Alicia Silverstone as a seductive Lolita (there is NO WAY she was 14 when she played that part), but before all you ladies out there dismiss me as another pervy-sleazo male, and before all you blokes out there salute me and offer to shake my hand, let me first have my say.The film does go down every expected route, and blatantly signposts where the climax is going to take place, but, I have to admit that there were moments when I thought that the femme fatale (or in this case, &#145;fille' fatale) would get away with it a la Linda Fiorentino in the Last Seduction, so it wasn't TOO predictable. As for the acting, well, and I'm not being biased, but Silverstone does give a good performance, whereas Rubin is pretty wooden and her character a tad confusing- she devolves from a Sharon Stone-esque vixen (You new here? I can tell.) to a shy, insecure schoolgirl who is almost unable to ask Nick out on a date. However, the extent to which this film engrosses you, if at all, rests on Elwes' performance. Personally, I can't take him seriously since Hot Shots, Robin Hood Men in Tights, the Princess Bride, Liar Liar etc. so I felt no emotional bond with him,particularly with all those accent slips!So, if you like those Single White Female type movies, and you've seen the best, then there's always this (which most definitely falls into the &#145;rest' category)--wait till it comes onto telly though&#133;        "},{"Title":"Beautiful Bumblings of a Blooming Betty","Date":"19 February 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This is every teenage girls dream come true, and every 30-something man's worst nightmare, maybeImagine an incredibly attractive, intriguing, intelligent man moves in partially in your lap.
