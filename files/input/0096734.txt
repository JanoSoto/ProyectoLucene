Forest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and The Green Mile are truly American classics.  For some reason (maybe I AM a weirdo) this is my favorite movie of his.  It has a simple plot, a light tone, shades of horror, and some GREAT one-liners that have stayed in my memory since I was nine years old. This is one of those movies that never gets old.  I especially like Corey Feldman as Ricky Butler.  He played the best burn-out I have ever seen and he truly is an underrated actor.  Rick Duccoman is great as the obnoxious neighbor, Art and his laid back manner continues to bring a smile to my face.  Bruce Dern is flat-out awesome as the war-crazed vet who has all the right gizmos for the job, but always fails miserably.  Almost every line out of his mouth is memorable and his response when he steps in a pile of dog crap is a classic quote.Obviously this is a satire on Suburban life and nosey neighbors, but I could care less about all that.  This is a classic that ranks (in my mind) with the likes of The Goonies and Smokey and the Bandit.If, for some reason, you missed this one, PLEASE see it.  You have no clue what you're missing.

Included in this terrific cast are Tom Hanks, who plays the skeptical neighbor of the new family on the block (a bunch of oddballs who never leave the house); Rick Ducommun, who plays the gluttonous friend of Hanks, who is convinced that the new neighbors are brain sucking murderers; Bruce Dern, the ex-soldier who hasn't quite left his miilitary roots behind him; and last, but not least, Corey Feldman, who plays the dopey teenage neighbor who basically watches the events of the movie unfold from the comfort of his front porch.  These characters are so well-acted and so downright wacky that you just have to believe there is a neighborhood somewhere with people like this.  The chemistry between everyone of the characters is simply impressive, and much of the humor of the film can be found in the often ludicrous way the director portrays their interactions.I urge anyone who has seen this film before to watch it again, this time paying little attention to the story and focusing on the superbly acted characters.

This is a premier example of such one of my favorites in that category. The fact others don't share that opinion doesn't bother me, but I am glad to see reviewers on this site who appreciated this black, very underrated gem.I always get a big kick out of this film, no matter how many times I see it.I credit a little-known actor for making this so entertaining to me Rick Ducommun. I think he steals the show from well-known stars Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern, Carrie Fisher and Corey Feldman. Actually, I think this film is panned a lot because they didn't expect Hanks to be in something this goofy. Too bad, but I bet he had a lot fun making it, along with the rest of the cast.Ducommun and Dern are the hilarious wackos who try to help straight-laced Hanks find out about the really-strange neighbors he has next door. Are these people some demented killers or just the figment of these nosy neighbors' imagination? Fisher is Hanks' always-complaining wife and Feldman is the teen across the street who watches all the lunacy from his porch, getting his getting nightly entertainment from these crazy adults.Director Joe Dante, of Gremlins fame, does a good job entertaining us in here, too, and providing some fun camera-work. Dante also used music to great advantage, mostly for humor.This is one of those not for all tastes films, so chances are you won't like it and think it's stupid. For a number of reasons, I love it.

We all have weird neighbors and can relate to what Hanks is going through. It has also been a fantasy for many of us to try and find out exactly what our neighbors are up to, but we never have the guts to do it.

He soon finds his excitement when he and his paranoid neighbors convince themselves the weirdos on the block are responsible for the strange disappearance of the neighborhood's beloved old man. So they do what any of us would do... break into their home to find proof of the dastardly deed.So many critics charged that Hanks tarnished his reputation with this effort. But for the umpteenth time, the critics were just being overly critical. THE 'BURBS is a hilarious, well-written and wonderfully creative piece of work. It's the kind of movie Joe Dante (GREMLINS, Matin√©e) does best. He takes a situation we can all basically relate to, turns it upside down and shakes the hell out of it like a snow globe.An unnecessarily heavy-handed ending is all that stands between THE 'BURBS and a 10-star rating. All of a sudden a fun little ride is derailed by an angry outburst and contrived syringe battle. If Dante had it to do over again, he surely would have come up with something more suitable (and humorous).Of course THE 'BURBS is not for all tastes, but if you like the pre-PHILADELPHIA Hanks and are in the mood for something completely different, you won't want to mi "},{"Title":"A deliciously black comedy...","Date":"17 August 2004","Score":"34 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  The world of black comedies has seen few truly classic entries in the past few years. It's a very specific sub genre of comedy that is extremely hard to do well as films like Very Bad Things frequently signify. Too many of Hollywood's more recent offerings feature truly tasteless gags that poke fun at subjects that should simply be left well enough alone. Well I have to say that Hollywood could learn a thing or two from its own past in this department. I recently rediscovered a childhood favourite of mine, The Burbs, and I have to admit that age has not in the least bit dulled the film's razor sharp wit and acid tongued dialogueTom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, an overstressed suburbanite who's decided to spend his vacation lounging around the house in a vain effort to relax. Of course he finds his efforts hindered by the constant presence of his somewhat excitable neighbors Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun) and Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) who suspect the new family in the neighbourhood, the Klopeks, of being mass murderers. Together these three decide to look into the suspicious nature of their new neighbors and just what exactly it is they get up to at night, the time when the otherwise reclusive Klopeks seem to be at their most active. The premise is basically the set up for another of Joe Dante's (who directed both Gremlins and its remake in all but name, Small Soldiers) bedlam filled romps through suburbs in which he casts a sideways glance at all things American dream.Quite frankly, my nostalgia for this movie makes it hard to find fault with it. Hanks is as funny as ever, playing it relatively straight compared to his other performances of the period and bringing a lovely shade of deep seated unease to an otherwise grounded character. Bruce Dern fills his role wonderfully, as the military obsessed Rumsfield, a character surprisingly reminiscent of survivalist Burt Gummer from the Tremors movies in both his nature and ability to steal scenes. The only weak link in the leading trio is Ducommun, which is a shame as it is really Art that drives the story more than any other character in the movie. Sure, Art has to be slightly obnoxious and a little irritating but Ducommun overplays these aspects so much that I began to find it painful to watch him as the end of the movie approached. It's hardly a surprise when Hanks tries to kill him. I can't help but feel that perhaps the late John Candy would have fit the role slightly better, bringing some more human and likable qualities to the character. At times however, The Burbs can feel a little uneasy in its pacing and sense of humour. Scenes like the screaming at the bone, although funny, seem out of place in what is otherwise a movie with a very dry sense of humour. Meanwhile the Klopeks are unveiled as characters perhaps a little too late in the story for the audience to truly develop any kind of opinions about them.Despite some small problems however, The Burbs remains an extremely funny movie with some terrific dialogue and almost universally good performances from its cast. I defy anyone not to laugh at Rumsfield's fall from the roof of his house or every man Ray's furious rant at the movie's close. For fans of black comedies, The Burbs is a perfect antidote to the current glut of obnoxious Hollywood gross out comedies and the Farrelly Brothers increasingly desperate to offend pieces.

Having heard nothing about this film and not even knowing of its existence until the film started, I was immediately worried I was about to see a horror film. Hey, I was only ten at the time, when I was still scared of horror movies. But what I ended up seeing was one of the most hilarious movies ever made, a movie that had the entire theater laughing all the way through. We later bought the video, and more recently the DVD, and over the years since it's release I've watched it countless times (the exact number probably somewhere in the 50s or so) and have never grown tired of it.While managing to be both suspenseful and funny at the same time, the film also does a great job after capturing the day-to-day life of a small suburban street, with a variety of characters so simple and life-like, it seems like they could actually live on your own street. The grumpy old guy down the street, the teenager who likes to throw parties while his parents are gown, the guy next door who comes over all the time and mooches food, and the average Everyday Joe who experiences it all at his own pace. The cast is an excellent combination, with everybody working great together, particularly Bruce Dern as the Vietnam vet who always has the right tool for the job and Tom Hanks as the average guy who's curious about his strange new neighbors, but not enough to really want to bother finding out more about them. If you've never seen it, I suggest giving it a look. It really is quite funny and has many quotable lines.

It looked like a lot of fun to make. Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) and his neighbors live in the epitome of Suburbia. They're very neighborly folks (aka nosy) who spend most of their time primping their yards and spying on their neighbors, the reclusive Klopeks who just moved in next door to Ray. They live in the only desolate house on the block, the one with the dried up grass and lone, dead tree in the front yard. At night, when Ray walks his dog, he hears strange noises and sees weird things coming from the Klopek's house. So, everyone in the neighborhood assumes the only logical thing--that the Klopeks are murderers.When their neighbor Walter goes missing, Ray and his idiot friend, Art (Rick Ducommun) are sure the Klopek's murdered him and buried him in the backyard. When the Klopek's leave their house to attend a University lecture for the day, Ray declares I'm going over there and I'm not coming back until I find a dead body. Nobody knocks off an old man in my neighborhood and gets away with it. Ray's wife, Carol (Carrie Fisher) is fed up with Art and Ray, as they continuously seem to get into trouble in trying to prove their theory that the Klopeks are murderers. But, when the cat's away, the mice will play.All the while, you're left wondering whether their paranoia has overtaken them, or whether the Klopeks really are capable of murder. It's always the quiet ones...There's a lot to enjoy here in this stupid comedy. Bruce Dern, above all else, is my favorite character as Ray's neighbor, Mark Rumsfield who is usually hilariously wimpy despite being a former soldier. (During a break from the final invasion, Rumsfield sits atop his roof carefully nibbling the heads off of animal crackers). Or when Art has to climb up an electrical pole to cut the power to the Klopek's house, Ray asks Mark why he didn't climb up there. It's very high, he says innocently. And I get the most laughs during the conversation Mark has with Uncle Rueben Klopek (Brother Theodore) when they all get together and pay the family a visit. About a nine on the tension scale, eh Rub? he asks the annoyed brother.Art is pretty funny too because he's a giant idiot who is really responsible for the mess that he and Ray and Mark get in when they go snooping around the Klopek's house. And, 80s fans won't want to miss Corey Feldman who, despite previously being an annoying teenager in later films, is actually quite funny here as slacker neighbor Ricky Butler who really knows how to throw a party. He knows that if Ray, Mark, and Art are up to something, then it's worth calling up all his rock n' roll stoner friends to come over and check out the action. This is my life. This is my neighborhood, he says proudly. Says Mark Rumsfield to his wife about Ricky, that kids a meatball.Joe Dante really does a good job here and works with a fantastic cast of characters, especially the supporting cast, in this story that parodies Suburban life. It's a really funny movie that is best for 80s fans. Loosen up and give it a go.

His ability to put a humorous slant on dark and twisted stories is put to good effect in The 'Burbs, a light-hearted tale of sinister goings-on in small-town America. While the story itself is thin and inconsequential, the clever playing by the cast of oddball character actors is a joy to watch and compensates for a lot. It's particularly interesting to see pre-superstardom Tom Hanks in another of the roles that nudged him up the star ladder, plus Carrie Fisher doing something other than Princess Leia, and of course Bruce Dern as an intimidating ex-soldier struggling to adapt to a quiet life in the suburbs.Mayfield Place is a small cul-de-sac in an unspecified town in America. It resembles any one of a million streets all over the country. Pretty much the most normal residents on the street are the Petersons - Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), his wife Carol (Carries Fisher), and their young son (Cory Danziger). They are surrounded by wackos and oddballs such as paranoid Art Weingartner (Rick Ducommun), ex-military man Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern) and his flirtatious young wife Bonnie (Wendy Schaal), dumb teenager Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman) and unsociable old timer Walter (Gale Gordon). But the oddest family of all lives next door to the Petersons. The Klopeks are reclusive Eastern Europeans who live in a run-down house that comes straight from the world of nightmares. No-one ever sees them out and about, but strange noises come from their basement in the middle of the night and they have a strange habit of digging holes in their back yard under the cover of darkness. During a week off work, Ray gradually convinces himself &#150; with a little help from his OTT neighbours &#150; that the Klopeks are mass murderers. When old Walter mysteriously vanishes, Ray is sure that he's the latest victims of the Klopek killing spree so he hatches a plan to break into their house and find the corpse&#133;..Dante creates a very believable atmosphere of paranoia, where the resident's prejudice against the Klopeks seems intentionally absurd, yet at the same time suspenseful. We laugh at these nosy neighbours because their actions against the Klopek family are outrageous, but at the same time the Klopeks appear so wonderfully weird and creepy that we find ourselves believing that they might be mass murderers. Hanks plays the normal family man caught up in what might be a non-existent adventure with fabulous skill, upstaged only by Dern, who is hilarious as the demented army freak. Dern manages to make even the straightest of lines amusing with his acerbic delivery &#150; at one point he tells an interfering teenage neighbour to shut up and paint your goddamn house! and succeeds in making this simplest of lines hysterically funny. The film is deceptively simple, with much less going on than actually seems to be the case, but generally-speaking it works very well. If you've ever had suspicions that your neighbours are up to no good, it's definitely a film that will plant some outrageous thoughts in your head!

When the movie opens, it zooms into the middle of the United States to what is simply a normal city. Yet Mayfield Place is anything but normal as weird noises are coming from a house that is very much in need of repair, and has no lawn to speak of. The owners of this house are the Klopeks, a weird, monstrous looking, Slavic family.The inhabitants of the street are a teenager left home by himself to paint he house (Corey Feldman). He spends his time sitting on the porch watching the events of his neigbourhood unfold, and offers some cheer as well. There is the old rich guy who has everything immaculate, and the army head who is right of Hitler. Then there is the neighbour who seems to live in everybody else's house, and finally there is Tom Hanks, who is the sane guy that is influenced by his peers.Everything starts off when the old guy vanishes, and they instantly suspect the Klopeks because they are odd. The thing about this movie is the definition of what is normal, and the pressure of American society to conform. Unfortunately this movie undermines this idea by actually having the Klopeks as being vicious monsters and that unless you are wholeheartedly American (ie like everybody else in this movie) then you are evil and should be arrested and locked up.Tom Hank's spiel really catches the essence of the theme in this movie. Throughout the entire movie the neighbours were causing a lot of problems for the Klopeks, for the main reason that they never left their house and never mingled with the people around them. This is seen as being strange and unamerican - if you do not associate with your neighbours then you must be up to something bad. Hanks says that this is not always true, and the reason some people hide away is not because they are mischievous, but because they are sick of people nosying in on them. He says that it is not the Klopeks who are insane, but those who are convinced that they are up to something.This movie is an attack at suburban, or even American paranoia, that those who do not behave like everybody is out to destroy their way of life. The American's value freedom (and this is written into their constitution) and movies such as this suggest that their pursuit of freedom infringes on the real issue of freedom, and that is for people to live how they like. What truly is freedom, and how far does one go to protect their freedom and not hinder the freedom of others. This is what the movie makes one think about.

These people move into an inexplicably blighted-looking empty house in the street and do - nothing.It's for the 'normal' neighbours, who are anything but, to lose control of their curiosities and goad comparatively reasonable Tom Hanks into spear-heading their paranoia. Most of the comic situations are typical American slapstick, but the timing is good and there's a sprinkling of witty or crude one-liners that move the otherwise flatulent effort along.However; it transpires that these neighbours really are a devilish crowd. The movie ramps-up a gear as even the scathingly pragmatic wife - here well played by Carrie Fisher, in between Jedi romances - becomes infected by the common suspicion. There are car crashes, houses catch fire, misunderstandings accumulate. A downhill out-of-control stretcher-ride through the suburb culminates the denouement.I think this movie deserves a '7' because it does at least find something to keep your attention most of the time, whether it's slap-stick stupidity, script, or situation comedy. Not exactly collectible, but well worth at least one watch.

He worked with Spielberg on his most successful films, the Gremlins films. This little film, which looks like it was shot entirely on leftover street sets on the Universal lot, came out of that period. Tom Hanks was still mostly known as a comedian (thank the heavens!), and it was still a time when Corey Felman being in the movie was a sign of hipness. For younger viewers who missed this time, the movie must be a time capsule. I remember seeing it in the theater and enjoying it a lot, and while it hasn't really held up necessarily as one of the best comedies of its era at the very least it offers some fun performances and a neat ironic perspective on suburbia.Hanks plays the suburban everyman, Ray Peterson, whose wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) wants him to relax and enjoy his vacation but whose best friends in the neighborhood (Bruce Dern and Rick Docummun) want him to take part in their juvenile spying games. When it starts to look more and more like their strange Eastern European neighbors might actually be serial killers or something of the sort, Ray and his friends go to extreme measures to try to infiltrate the spooky house.Rick Docummun is a bit annoying for the amount of screen time he gets here, but Bruce Dern is the best thing about the movie. He plays a paranoid 'Nam veteran with a trophy wife (Wendy Schaal) and an overdose of tenacity. Fisher and Hanks are good as the central couple as well. Feldman is awfully irritating in this movie because Dante chooses to let him basically narrate to the camera as if he were Frankie Avalon or Ferris Bueller. The brilliant comic actor Brother Theodore and notable character actor Henry Gibson are wonderful as the bizarre Klopeks. Dante/Corman regular Dick Miller shows up in a funny bit as a conservative garbage collector paired with a hippy type partner (Robert Picardo) who insists that the customers have the right to look at their neighbors' trash. I would have liked to see a whole movie just about Picardo and Miller.The unfortunate thing about the film is that it promises a lot more than it delivers. The first 20 or 30 minutes are great, with setting up the fun characters and the goofy situation. But by the end everything is a bit forced. There's no reason for Dr. Klopek to betray himself so obviously, it seems like it was just done to wrap the film up on a sort of Twilight Zone vibe that doesn't fit the tone of the film. It could have been a smarter movie if Hanks' character and his friends truly were delusional. But for whatever this movie is, I'll take it. It's pretty much the last movie that I thought Hanks was funny in (no, not Joe Versus the Volcano no thank you). It was great to see Carrie Fisher in the movie after she hadn't been on screen in any movies I'd seen in a few years, and it's still fun to see her in this kind of domestic housewife situation. She could always add a funny moment or two to a comedy, as she did in Austin Powers as well. The early parts of the movie though seem to promise something like Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, a smart dark comedy on suburban absurdity, but the film doesn't really follow through.

I will not bore you with a summary of this film because I cannot see anyone not liking it. The Burbs is perfectly at home with films like The Goonies in being ideal for a night in with friends, and fair amount of pizza, and a selection of beer (or a choice soft drink!).

Not to say that it is the best movie of all time, but rather my favorite. I am often skeptical when someone says that their favorite movie of all time is something like the painfully overrated Shawshank Redemption, or a true classic like Citizen Kane, The Godfather, or even contemporary best picture winners like A Beautiful Mind or Forrest Gump. I think that while some (and I do stress SOME) or these movies have more accomplished casts, a better plot, and in some cases revolutionary filmmaking, they aren't really people's favorites. They aren't movies like the Burbs' which one can watch time and time again and continue to laugh or think of past times watching the movie. They aren't movies that one is likely to watch every two months or so, or sit down and watch them at 300 AM if they happen to be on. The movies that people watch at 300 AM are movies like The Burbs'. These movies are funny, hold sentimental value to the watcher, and are easy to watch over and over again.Now onto precisely why I like The Burbs' soooo much. First and foremost it is a funny movie. The characters, especially Bruce Dern's are all quirky and deliver some good lines. For example when Bruce says, There go the god damn brownies! after he part of the Klopeks porch collapses, it makes me laugh...hard. It's in his delivery. Like I previously mentioned sentimentality also plays a big role. I have fond memories watching this throughout my childhood and now into college. I lived in the suburbs all my lives and find some of the characters though somewhat cookie cutter images, to be accurate. I really like the Corey Feldman character, and every time I go outside to do yard work, or paint the house (like he does), I pan the block and hear that song in my head (I don't know the name, but the heavy metal one he puts on that goes I am your war machine....). Tom Hanks is great in this movie also and some of the stuff he says like I believe a man's furnace is his own business., is priceless. My friend Justin and I like to fill our conversations with Burbs lines. He particularly likes the lines offered by the grizzled uncle Reuben; even his harsh No. is a favorite.No, this movie isn't going to win alot of awards or be held in high regard in most circles, but it should be. Just the way the characters interact with each other is funny. The Burbs has a certain charm about it that allows me to keep watching it over and over. It doesn't rely on gags that may make the viewer howl with laughter the first time they see it but fade with future viewings. Instead it relies on funny lines delivered Hanks' funniest outing. For God's sake this is a Corey Feldman movie that is good! While some of you are bound to disagree that this movie is very funny, I kind of like it that way. I like that the Burbs is kind of developing a cult following (not a really big one, but big enough that I run into people that really like it). I like that this movie has it's own little audience. It's proof enough to me that movies like The Burbs will live on in the minds of millions as people's favorites of all time. I know it will live on for me.

Although the actor who played the part of Art did a perfectly fine job.

The one few of your friends know, but you could quote all day long? (My brother and I still refer to weird neighbors as Klopeks).That's The 'Burbs for me. A small gem by Joe Dante, this black comedy follows a bunch of nosy neighbors investigating a strange family. Ominous noises erupt from their cellar at night; dark shapes dig in the garden at unlikely hours; when an elderly man disappears, schlub Ray (Tom Hanks in one of his best comedic roles) and his pals take action.The movie co-stars a young and pretty Carrie Fisher as Ray's wife Carol, Rick Ducommun as a petty conspiracy theorist and Corey Feldman. Best of all is the great Bruce Dern as unhinged senior veteran Rumsfield, a mix between John Goodman from The Big Lebowski and Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino. In a casting gag, Henry Gibson as the Klopek patriarch sees the other side of his famous Fright Night role.Thanks to Dante's deft touch and to sly performances, even little moments shine. My favorite is probably the sardines scene Carol attempts to take charge of the situation and have a civil meeting with the Klopeks, who offer them a nasty-looking snack with pretzels and sardines. Rumsfield keeps badgering the neighbors (Hans! A FINE Christian name... Hans Christian Andersen!), with Ray uselessly trying to deflate tension; when the situation escalates, Ray jumps from the couch and rushes to the bathroom. It's silly, but has me in stitches every time. Even throwaway lines are brilliant (He is not coming out until he resembles the man I married!, We don't have that kind of time!).Jerry Goldsmith provides one of his best comedic soundtracks, throwing in everything from sinister organs to Morricone-inspired guitar blasts.Brisk, clever and endlessly quotable.9/10 "},{"Title":"An Excellent,Hilarious,Underrated Black Comedy.

While on vacation,Ray begins to hear strange noises next door from his neighbors The Klopeks people who rarely come of their house. Now,Ray along with his other neighbors Mark Rumsfield(Bruce Dern)and Art Weingartner)want to investigate their mysterious neighbors and laughs and insanity ensues.Released in 1989,The 'Burbs was a great,hilarious Black Comedy that did modest business at the Box Office and received mixed reviews from movie critics and was basically ignored at the time when it was released in theaters but thankfully over the years The 'Burbs has gained an audience and wonderful Cult Following since it's release and is seen as the fantastic,underrated Comedy that it is. The 'Burbs is in my opinion of the funniest films ever made and is one of those movies where when you first see it or watch it for the first time on Home Video or Television you will love it immediately because every neighborhood has a tale about mysterious and quiet neighbor or neighbors and The Burbs puts it on the movie screen. From beginning to end The 'Burbs is a film that is filled with great laughs that are nonstop as well as hilarious and funny and the Comedy is surreal and demented,dark and twisted and at the same time quirky and offbeat with dialog and one-liners that are done with dry wit and over the top style. While the The 'Burbs is a Comedy director Joe Dante mixes in elements of other genres such as Horror,Mystery and Satire. The Horror and Mystery elements of the movie make the film and certain scenes eerie and Suspenseful where one minute you are laughing the next you are on the edge of your seat. I think that the mixture of those different genres gives the movie an atmosphere that is creepy and weird but also haunting and sinister in a truly nightmarish way with rain and noises but the atmosphere is done in a funny and stylish way that fits the strange and bizarre world of The 'Burbs The Satire is also one of the things that I love about The 'Burbs is the way the film mocks and makes a Satire of Suburban culture showing all the things often associated with the suburbs green glass that's clean,beautiful houses and concrete ground that is spotless and the suburbia in The 'Burbs seems perfect and flawless but underneath the perfect style of Suburbia there is something off and very wrong going on and the wrong things going on in The 'Burbs is done and told in a funny way. The character Ray Peterson is a great and funny character because he's just a regular guy that wants to rest and enjoy his vacation but when Ray and his neighbors investigate The Klopeks he gets himself into situations that are hilarious and over the top and with Ray and his neighbors Rumsfield and Art investigating The Klopeks you never know what's going to happen next. The screenplay by Dana Olsen is fantastic and well-written,with Olsen giving the main characters memorable dialog that is funny and clever and telling a great,off the wall story about Suburbia. The ending of The 'Burbs is laugh out loud funny and thrilling at the same time with laughs and surprises all around. The ending is a great conclusion to the film that will have viewers smiling.The whole cast is great. Tom Hanks is excellent,hilarious and at his best as Ray Peterson,with Hanks bringing laughs and energy to the role. Bruce Dern is amazing and funny as Lt. Mark Rumsfield,with Dern saying great one-liners. Carrie Fisher is wonderful as Carol Petersen,Ray's wife. Ray Ducommun is fantastic and a laugh riot as Art,Ray's neighbor and Ducommun has great scenes with Hanks. Corey Feldman is great and funny as Ricky,a observes everything and loves his street. Wendy Schaal is wonderful and sexy as Bonnie Rumsfield,Mark's wife. Henry Gibson(Dr. Werner Klopek)Brother Theodore(Uncle Reuben Klopek)and Courtney Gains(Hans Klopek)are terrific and quirky as The Klopeks.

Fantastic direction,Dante.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is amazing,haunting and intense and truly matches the tone of the movie. I also love Goldsmith's homage to Ennio Morricone's Spagetti Western scores in one of the scenes. Great score,Goldsmith.In final word,if you love Tom Hanks,Joe Dante,Comedies,Black Comedies or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The 'Burbs,an excellent,hilarious,underrated Black Comedy that you can watch again and again.

The 'Burbs Is Classic Tom Hanks and Joe Dante","Date":"17 October 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I'm not completely familiar with the films of Joe Dante. I've watched Gremlins which is an absolute classic and I'm looking forward to seeing The Howling. The 'Burbs is one of his films and I don't think I can say anything less than that it was a really fun movie that had some witty yet dark humor, a wonderful 80s feel, an expectedly brilliant performance by Tom Hanks and an engaging mystery. On top of that, I've detected a lot of influence from classic thrillers from Alfred Hitchcock, notably Rear Window and Psycho as well as slight resemblances to To Kill A Mockingbird.The story is set in a neighborhood like any other. Ray Peterson is off from work and doesn't have anything to do on his vacation other than to walk around in his pyjamas all day looking for something to do. A month earlier, new neighbors moved into the dark house next door to him but something's strange about them. Nobody has seen or met them, weird noises come from the house at night and the property is an absolute mess. One of Ray's other neighbors, Walter disappears and Ray along with his other pals being to suspect that the Klopek's are committing murders. A very Hitchcockian plot, and who doesn't love that? The humor in the film is dark yet witty and always amusing. I especially love how the filmmakers have gone out of their way to make the Klopek family seem as unusual as possible. It creates the right sort of mood to fit with the fun loving tone. I do feel that the design of the family and their household does come off as really clich√©d and corny, but I can see what they were doing when putting the movie together.The acting is great. Outside of a wonderful performance by the always great Tom Hanks, the other actors do very well too. Rick Ducommon and Bruce Dern are highly entertaining as Ray's neighbors and provide a nice mix of verbal and physical humor which I really got good laughs out of. I also quite liked Carrie Fisher. I haven't seen many movies with her outside of the Star Wars trilogy, but I feel she did fine in her role as the wife reluctant to embrace her husband's far fetched theories. Another favorite of mine is Corey Feldman. I don't think this is the best performance of his career and his character isn't all that important, but I still enjoyed him nonetheless.One thing I think is worth criticizing though is a movement done with the camera in the scene where Ray and Art find a bone. The camera quickly zooms in and out. It seemed like an attempt at creating tension or indicate surprise, but it just looked silly to me and I admit that I actually got a little giggle out of it. As for my reference to 'To Kill A Mockingbird'... look at the design of the house and the way in which the Klopeks are viewed by the other neighbors. As if they aren't making a reference to Boo Radley. Another thing worth making note of is the wonderful level of twists and turns in the story. This film didn't come out in a way I expected it to and I freaking loved that.Overall, The 'Burbs is a classic and criminally underrated film. It's a great piece of fun that mixes lightheartedness with slight Gothic undertones which results in a film that can be enjoyed by almost everyone. For Tom Hanks fans, it's a must see.9/10 "},{"Title":"Trust me, it's funny","Date":"11 September 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" The plot involves Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) and his eccentric neighbors (Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun)who are convinced that their new neighbors are murderers.

Bruce Dern is hilarious as Rumsfield, an ex soldier who still dresses in uniform and uses the terminology. The humor is kind of subtle which acutely makes it more funny. In my opinion, makes it more realistic. Subtle humor is good because you don't have the trouble of having the jokes forced out. Good comedies have been ruined by forcing jokes out. That does not happen in 'The 'Burbs'.This film is so under rated. To me it's a classic and should be a lot more popular. Anyone can enjoy this fantastic comedy, from children, to the elderly.

Then they have the crazy ex-military guy played by Bruce Dern who in out for adventure. He gets a thrill out of using his military tools and spying on the Klopexs like they were the enemy in war. The last main character is the nosy neighbor who does not have anything going on but know everybody else's business.

Usually, they become so dark that they cease to be funny or entertaining to me...a good example of this is War of the Roses. There have been some that I enjoyed though and this is one of them. I usually like the ones that only really edge towards the dark side a bit and I would say this one does that. It kind of goes into horror at times, but still remains funny unlike another black horror/comedy Parents with Randy Quaid. This film features a new family moving into a very old and not so attractive house. These newcomers are under immediate scrutiny and suspicion as they move in the middle of the night, do not do anything to really fix up the place, and are generally strange looking when some of the people in the neighborhood pay them a visit. Tom Hanks character is not really suspicious at first till his crazy neighbor and a paranoid one convince there is something up with the new family in the burbs. You get many funny scenes as these guys try to find proof that the new family is as strange as they look and are in fact up to something as the poodle a man who lives in the neighborhood shows up dirty and the neighbor ends up missing. The movie plays out rather good and is funny for the most part, at times it becomes a bit to dark as most black comedies tend to do. The cast is very funny and I think this is like the only movie I have seen Carrie Fisher in besides the Star Wars trilogy. Bruce Dern to me steals the show in terms of comedy followed by the neighbor who deduces the bone is human. Not sure of his name or any other movies he has done prior to or since this one.

Joe Dante has a way of combining dark humor and outright horror and make it convincing to a mass audience (see 'Gremlins.') That this film has a lot of dark elements and remains just a light romp at the end is a feat unto itself. All credit goes to Hanks' good natured comedic performance and Dante's fun with the material.Dante paints a portrait of the neighborhood at the very beginning. Hanks plays Ray, probably the most normal among the neighbors. Art is like a big kid and the first one to suspect the neighbors of foul play. Bruce Dern plays a war vet where Ricky Butler, played by Corey Feldman is the loud teenager. All is well in suburbia until clues pop up that might reveal the new neighbors, the Klopeks, as murderers.With any other talent behind the film, this could have been a very dark comedy. But instead of playing up the horror, Dante has fun with it, playing up the comedy talents of his performers (notably Hanks and Dern, who take turns chewing scenery). Dante also has fun with visuals, notably in a hilarious dream sequence that Ray has.Everything comes together to make this film work, including a great score by Jerry Goldsmith, that is part suburban comedy and part horror, complete with organs culled from a funeral march. This film is far from perfect, but it's fun diversional comedy and reminds of the great comic actor that Tom Hanks once was before becoming Oscar's golden boy.

It is a nice little movie, the kind of scary movie you can watch with the kids, and some nice humor, too.The thing that caught my eye about it was the presence of both Henry Gibson and the ever-cool Carrie Fisher, a reunion of the two, who also co-starred in The Blues Brothers (1980) as enemies of Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi's Jake and Elwood Blues, with Gibson as a comical yet intense deranged Neo-Nazi leader and Fisher as a similarly driven and well-armed babe with her own reasons to hate the brothers. Both actors do well in this film as well, and as a big fan of the BB, it was great to see them together again here. Their roles are slightly different, but the comic timing and ability to use drama as a foil for the comedy shine for both. (Also, Carrie Fisher seems to have worked with EVERYBODY. You could almost do a Kevin Bacon style association game with her roles. With The 'burbs, one can add Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern, and Rance Howard - Ron's dad - to the list.)Anyway, the other cool touch was seeing the long-haired heavy-metal-listening kids in the movie. I was a kid in New Jersey around the same time and they reminded me of folks I used to know. Plus myself, though my hair was never that long and sprayed out. Especially that they were like Whoa, awesome when everyone else was getting scared of the scary stuff.Of course, Tom Hanks also gets mention here as well. This movie features a good performance from him, around the same time as Big this sort of helped to cement him as a comic actor and get him more experience and face time.... setting up momentum for his huge run through the nineties. His role is pretty well-done and he executes it very well. I was interested when I checked it out on here to see that either the director or writer of this film also did Matinee with John Goodman, which is another gem worth checking out. (If you like the MST3K style cheesy horror flicks, or the Martin Landau Ed Wood movie, you will especially like Matinee, which lovingly satirizes the horror film makers of the late 1950s/early 1960s against the backdrop of the _really_ scary Cuban Missile Crisis.)Plus, again, this one isn't too gory, and with the humor, it can probably be watched with kids with very few worries. If you are a movie buff, you will dig this movie. If you are looking for a fun fright-fest that you don't mind sharing with the kids, you will probably dig it, too. Heh... dig it... oddly appropriate.

Sounds good to me!I have to admit that this movie has it's dull moments, but there's extremely silly moments too. Tom Hanks is really funny in this, I thought. This was maybe his last goofy light-hearted movie before appearing in more serious movies like Forrest Gump or Saving private Ryan in the 90's. Some of the characters in this are so typical of 80's movie. By example, the sexy bubble-headed neighbor who's always half dressed and always nice to everyone and the annoying typical teenager played, of course, by Corey Feldman.This really isn't a movie for everyone. Most people would find it stupid and unfunny, but if you're not difficult and you like the 80's, you'll like it. Also, it doesn't rely on exploitation or sex jokes to make it interesting. A good movie to watch if you're stuck at home on a rainy day.

Sure, it's not very sophisticated or artistic, but it wasn't just made to earn a buck, either. I appreciate the time that it took Joe Dante to figure this film out and make it. The cast is excellent. Tom Hanks is a little underplayed, even though he has his moments of fun. Rick Ducommun is the great boob of a neighbor that resembles a leech more than a man (we all know those kind of people). Finally, Bruce Dern is sweet as the Vietnam vet living out the rest of the war on his front lawn, while eating animal crackers. The other roles are fairly downplayed, not really offering the characteristics or foibles that stand out as much as our three heroes. The crew is made up of one of my favorite teams Dante and Goldsmith. Joe Dante directs and Jerry Goldsmith writes music for it. Dante includes all his trademarks in this film cameos by Dick Miller and Robert The Doctor Picardo, numerous homages to other films, and whimsy you can cut with a knife. Goldsmith takes the film to another level beyond the visual elements of the storytelling and adds the musical elements, which subtly shape the feel of the movie. Without the organ motif, the Klopeks wouldn't be as creepy or mysterious. Why would their neighbors suspect them of anything? Without PATTON motif, would Dern's character have been as likable or tough? Overall, The 'burbs inspires me, as a filmmaker (an amateur one at that), to go out and make a whimsical movie that's fun for the audience and shows them a fun time for an hour and a half. I'm inspired by the gags, the eccentric performances, and the music. I recommend everyone see this, just so you don't sound so lame for seeing only the popular movies that all your friends and neighbors have seen. STICK IT TO THE MAN! Oh wait...I'm one of them!

This was a movie where three idiots went on a paranoid rampage and tried to prove that their new neighbors were serial killers, blew up their house in the process, and go to jail once they find out they're not actually serial killers!

One that looks very much something Tim Burton would create. Within the neighbourhood live some interesting characters which involve sceptical average Ray and Carol Peterson (Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher), greedy impulsive crow-shooting Art Weingartner(Rick Ducommun), ex-military soldier Mark and Bonnie Rumsfield (Bruce Dern and Wendy Schaal), typical late 80s teen Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman) and a short role by Gale Gordon as cantankerous Walter Seznick who lets his dog Queenie poop on Rumsfield's lawn.Ray notices strange goings on from new neighbours called The Klopeks which consists of 'The Doctor' Werner (played well by Henry Gibson), Uncle Reuben (Brother Theodore) and his ungainly son called Hans (Courtney Gains). This starts a huge investigation by the suburbanites, especially when they discover Hans is driving the squelchy garbage out of his garage and bashes it into a bin with a stick. As time goes by, the investigations headed by Mark Rumsfield get more extreme as they understand Walter is missing and all that's left is his toupee...The film is a great comedy about social values and the way communities interact with each other, especially when an unknown outsider comes on the scene. Tom Hanks plays his typical blas√© character to perfection, Rick Ducommun and Bruce Dern are brilliant as enthusiastic Art and off-kilter Mark. You know that these paranoid twosome are the driving forces in the film. Both showing some great character acting with some cracking linesI find one more...Just one...I'm gonna catch him and staple his ass shut - Mark Rumsfield finding out the hard way that Queenie has been crapping on his lawn.'Bout a nine on the tension scale there, Reub. - Mark Rumsfield after Reuben responds dramatically after being asked whether his name was Slavik.Listen to your wife!?! Who listens to their wife? - Arts way of trying to persuade Ray to his way of thinking.Ray! You're chanting! I wanna kill everyone. Satan is good, Satan is our pal...Once they get in here (points to head) it's over pal. - Art's response to Ray's refusal to listen to him by sticking his fingers in his ears and talking over him.The ladies, soft and naive Bonnie and level-headed Carol are the counterfoil to the men's extreme child-like behaviour and do their bit to drive the plot along too (most notably inviting themselves face-to-face into the Klopeks house armed with a plate full of brownies).Ricky Butler's role is to stir the pot and goad Art and Mark on in their investigations (though they need little encouragement) and also to be a spectator for the events that unfurl as he invites his mates around to 'watch the show'.Incidental bits like Ray throwing his morning coffee at the paperboy and crushing beer cans to ease pent up rage, Art blindly picking out some food from a bowl not knowing it's meant to be for the dog all help to flesh out the characters.Some great scenes involve Art and Mark, with half his face covered in shaving foam, sitting in a garbage truck looking through rubbish hoping to find a body part dumped by the Klopeks and one hilarious roof pratfall made by Mark Rumsfield which causes him to release a shot from his gun and smash a car window which sets off the alarm.Henry Gibson, Courtney Gains and Brother Theodore are interesting choices to play the Klopeks. Gibson's intelligent charm contrasts deeply with Brother Theodore's abrupt rough mannerisms as Hans captures the 'scared animal in headlights' look accurately.However, the film loses it's way in the end because it opts for the two endings in one which I think is a bit of a cop-out. What would have been nice is perhaps see the film have two alternative endings; one showing the Klopeks to be innocent with the neighbours being the ones who are crazy, driven mad by their boring monotonous lives and the other ending showing the finale discovering that the Klopeks killed the Knapps in the end.If given the choice I think I would have preferred the darker first ending. It could have been a subtle 1980s precursor to Dale and Tucker vs Evil.

Directed by Joe Dante (of Gremlins fame), and featuring some of the biggest names from the 1980's, it's a movie that still is still hilarious from a somewhat gentler political time.Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher play the central family unit during a weekend holiday, representing the ideal American family living somewhere in unknown suburbia. Every neighbour plays a wonderful caricature of the typical melting pot that makes the U.S such a weird and wonderful place to live. There is a retired war veteran (Bruce Dern), and his beautiful young wife (Wendy Schaal) ready to play taps and raise the American flag every morning. The young rock and roller (Corey Feldman), left home alone for the weekend with a few chores to do around the house, but will spend the majority of this weekend drinking beer and running amok. And the 'everyman' neighbour Art (Rick Ducommun) who plays the instigating and downright rude best friend to the main character. Each one brings a different persona to this crazy little neighbourhood, and they blend well together.The plot revolves around a family of recluses, the Klopek family, who rumour has it are mentally disturbed, extremely secretive, maybe even homicidal. Every neighbour has a different story to tell about them, and following a night of a massive power outage, the rumours spread quickly. Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) becomes quickly paranoid and the neighbours become more and more aggressive when it comes to finding out what's going on in the Klopek's house. It doesn't take long before a few of the more suspicious neighbours decide to sneak into their home and finally figure what's going on in their dilapidated home.A comedy from a different generation, where breaking and entering was considered a petty crime.

The neighbors are as darkly freaky as the rest of the Barone family with Hanks a definite variation of Ray Romano and Carrie Fisher as uptight and irascible as Debra Barone. Add in such odd characters as Gale Gordan's grumpy old man, chronically high teen Corey Feldman and Bruce Dern's redneck. This is suburban hell, and there appears to be no escape.When Hanks, Dern and another neighbor snoop on the newcomers, they spot someone who looks like Eddie Munster and Lurch's love child with what appears to be a body bag, they suspect foul play. Then, grumpy Gordan disappears, furthering the mystery. The three men begin to get spooked out, and from there, things just weirder and weirder, starting with a dream sequence that make Tevye's nightmare seem like having tea with Mr. Rogers. With neighbors like this (which includes Laugh-In actor Henry Gibson as a rather strange doctor), who needs cul de sacs?I've had my share of strange or annoying neighbors over the years, but at least I could find things to laugh about. I found minimalistic things to laugh at here, and the whole black comedy theme is truly overdone. Perhaps on paper, the script seemed funnier, or overtime it has just been weighed down in bad taste. The late 1980's and early 90's had a slew of strange neighbor comedies with suburban themes, and a good majority of them are truly bad. But this one is even worse, because it seems to pride itself on thinking that it is much funnier than it is, and in retrospect that smugness is what kills it.

If you don't know of this time that I speak then ask your dad and watch this weeks slice of late eighties fun called The 'Burbs. This film is reminiscent of so many films of that time. Weird, off the wall flicks that seem like a stoner fantasy but for some reason, the kismet was there and they work. They shouldn't, but they do.Driected by Joe Dante (Oh, you know we are going to visit the Gremlins, both 1 and 2, at a later date), The 'Burbs takes all of the old tropes of nosy neighbors and builds a slapstick horror around it. Ray Peterson (Hanks) is off from work and becomes obsessed with the strange new neighbors, the Klopecks, with a fair amount of goading from his friends (played hilariously by Rick Ducommun and Mock Films Blog alum Bruce Dern). With little or nothing to do with their free time, the three buddies spy on the eccentric activities of the new residents, like digging up their own yard in the dead of night or the odd noises emanating from their basement. As the strange behavior continues next door, one of the members of the block disappears mysteriously, adding to the speculation from Ray and his cohorts that the Klopecks may be a family of serial killers. What follows is a well crafted, keep you guessing mystery which brings genuine laughs to the audience.&#x97; "},{"Title":"Strange, clean, dumb fun.","Date":"29 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Strange, but in a good way.

It is very successful at being a light, suspenseful, comedy. It's a fun, old, blast-from-the-past, movie with a weird script and solid, workmanlike, but unexceptional acting. Strange new neighbors move into Tom Hank's 'hood, and he and his current (also) strange neighbors begin to suspect that they're not entirely benign, which sets up the comical investigations to follow.I can't believe I never saw this before, and while it's not great film-making by any means, it's different enough and well-done enough to be easily justify the time spent on it, and, if it's a concern of yours, it's very clean to boot.

Not only is it funny and a modern satire of suburban life, it is quite creepy and suspenseful. This movie is like an 80's version of Disturbia, but a more funnier version. Not every joke was funny, but many of them were. The movie seems perfect for a Halloween film for families, and this movie ranks up there with another 80's classic, The Goonies. Joe Dante's film is about a suburbanite named Ray Petersen who decides to take the week off. But he is worried about his creepy new neighbors. Along with a crazed military veteran and the eccentric neighbor named Art, they decide to investigate the neighbors when an old man goes missing. I thought the acting was very good. Tom Hanks is a natural actor and gifted at comedy, at least he was in the 80's. He was very good as the man who tries to stay out of trouble. Bruce Dern was absolutely fantastic as the lieutenant who knows the gadgets, but fails to use them correctly. Corey Feldman was decent as the teenage neighbor. Carrie Fisher played the typical wife who persuades her husband to stay out of trouble. Overall, The 'Burbs was an excellent movie that pokes fun at the eccentricity of suburban life. It not only succeeds at being a simple- minded comedy, but it succeeds at being a suspenseful thriller. I liked the ending as it perfectly ended the movie. Tom Hanks has done better movies, but this is a showcase of his talent and what is to come. A creepy and funny movie this is.

A huge range of films released in the much loved decade had fun as their number one mantra and director Joe Dante was a filmmaker that well and truly delivered on this front. The Howling, Explorers and his much loved Gremlins were all fine examples of this entertaining spirit that washed over many an 80's gem and Dante tried in similar vein but less successfully to replicate the good times in later films Gremlins 2, Matin√©e, Small Soldiers, Looney Tunes Back in Action and The Hole. During this 80's high time of fun Dante produced one of the decades last bastions of silly good times with his 1989 hit, The 'Burbs.A fitting movie for any person that may have found themselves apart of Suburbia, The 'Burbs is a film entirely set in a particularly interesting street where neighbours spy upon neighbours, dogs do their business on other peoples lawns oh and a seemingly murderous family conduct nightly experiments and dig graves in the backyard. Dante taps into the spirit of neighbourly comrade and the gossip that comes with it and makes the brave move of keeping the action entirely set in the suburb of Mayfield Place which gives The 'Burbs a real sense of character and atmosphere that was so prevalent and important to films of its vintage. It's all part of the films charm and gentle tone and makes us the viewer feel a part of the adventures these characters have, led by the always enjoyable Tom Hanks.The 'Burbs features an incredible variety of rag tag figures with Tom Hanks's wishing for a quiet housebound, pyjama clad holiday at home Ray Peterson the central figure. Surrounded by Carrie Fisher's demanding wife Carol, Bruce Dern's army obsessed ex-lieutenant Mark Rumsfield, Ray's obnoxious best friend Art and Corey Feldman's typically loud mouthed teen Ricky, The 'Burbs succeeds most completely at creating an interesting and oft relatable bunch of figures in an at times downright bonkers story. Not a whole lot that happens throughout the movie makes a whole lot of sense, right down to the explosive and overblown finale but it doesn't matter as the key flow on from having too much fun, is not really caring about what does and doesn't seem to glue together.An easy to watch, occasionally laugh out loud tale, The 'Burbs has slowly become a lesser seen example of the 80's comedy staples and a somewhat forgotten part of Tom Hanks's impressive filmography. Joe Dante is still a prevalent filmmaker in today's market but sadly his films have been relegated to direct to disc or TV show fair and it would be lovely to see him once more tap back into his 80's mojo and provide us with something along these lines, as fun is still as important to films as it ever was.3 and a half femur bones out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"Funny, Interesting And Fantastic","Date":"30 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" This film was absolutely hilarious, it was really funny!

We have all known that one family in a street or town who don't follow the rules of social norms and are ostracised by those who strive for normality (IE the REAL freaks). We all know of people lower down than us on the social ladder which makes us feel content with achieving something or enjoying our own slightly elevated spot in society. But who know what really goes on behind closed doors? In truth we are all weird, we are all insane, and sane and insane can easily switch places if the minority becomes the majority.That's all about to happen in Mayfield Place &#x96; quiet suburb of the idyllic Mid-Western Hinkley Hills. Ray Peterson (a puppy-fat-faced Otm Shank) has recently lost his job and is keeping said fact from his wife. During his week off he has nothing to occupy his time and so takes to intruding upon his new neighbors. The foreign Klopeks are not following the Mayfield Place rules. Their lawn is dead and weedy, the house is ramshackle and faded, they hardly ever leave or appear outdoors, and they certainly don't bother making friends or filling the void with meaningless chit-chat.A reason enough to be suspicious according to Ray, his screwball pal Art, and ex-military Mark Rumsfield (Rick Ducommun and Bruce Dern, forming a perfect comic trinity). Multiple attempts to politely get to know the Klopeks fail, so its fair game for trespassing, snooping around, and breaking and entering. It certainly seems like the Klopeks are up to no good but by the end of the movie it's largely irrelevant as the big reveal comes and goes with no explanation or real connection to the story.What The 'burbs does have going for it is manic energy between the cast and a lively, inventive, and massively fun score by Jerry Goldsmith. The supporting cast could have been improved though. Carrie Fisher as the wife just doesn't do it for me with her mannish hairdo and short stature. It would have been a much better idea to cast someone like Meg Ryan instead. Fisher is loses to Wendy Schaal who is much funnier as Rumsfield's wife. Corey Feldman also loses as an unholy combination Ted Theodore Logan and Patrick Swayze's Bodhi. His Valley Kid dialect and surfer/80s drop-out culture styling are completely out of place.Despite the shortcomings there is still loads to enjoy with The 'burbs and it will keep you coming back again and again.

The 'Burbs just seems to be missing something. Whether it's the surprisingly subdued Tom Hanks, who is allowed only glimpses of the energy he was so famous for in his early days, or the film's failure to really subvert any of our expectations, it's unclear.The grumpy Ray Peterson (Hanks) has just begun his one-week vacation, which he has decided to spend lounging around in his pyjamas and drinking beer rather than going fishing or taking his wife (Carrie Fisher) and son on a trip. He is soon drawn in to best friend Art's (Rick Ducommun) curiosity at the strange behaviour of the street's most recent additions, who have moved into a Gothic building that sticks out like a sore thumb. They keep to themselves and are rarely seen outside the house, but at night, great discharges of electricity flash and boom from their basement. Just what are they up to? Ray, Art and ex-army nut Lt. Rumsfeld (Bruce Dern) are determined to find out, while lazy stoner Ricky (Corey Feldman) enjoys the show from his porch.Every now and then, The 'Burbs throws in a bit of inspiration. Whether it's the crash-zoom, over-the-top screaming of Ray and Art upon learning of possible foul play, Ricky's discovery of reality 'TV' years before morons couldn't get enough of it, or the sight of the strange family digging holes in their lawn where you get a real sense of Dante's skill at horror, we get only glimpses of the film that perhaps could have been. Dante doesn't seem invested in the story somehow, as if it was a half-baked idea that was never given the dedication it needed. The observations of suburban life seem dated, as if torn out of a 1960's comic-strip, and the various vignettes which play out in the early scenes are not as funny as they should be.Apart from Ducommun, whose prat-falls and incessant man-child behaviour gets old very quickly, the cast perform extremely well. When Hanks is occasionally let off the leash, his semi-improvised lunacy reminds us of what he did best before all the Oscar-winning nonsense of Forrest Gump (1994), and Dern is the only consistently funny character in the entire film. But when the credits rolled, I found myself pondering the point of the film. It doesn't sway the plot in any direction other than the one you expect it to go, and although it's a mildly pleasant ride along the way, when Feldman's Ricky says to camera at the climax I love this street!, I couldn't help but think why?.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Playful Caricatures Abound, Though Their Obsession is Brow-Furrowing","Date":"23 July 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Life amongst the white middle class at the dawn of the 1990s, as seen through the exaggerated eye of a superpowered magnifying glass. Tom Hanks plays the lead, a meek all-American dad who's plagued by quirky neighbors throughout his long-awaited staycation. There's a lot of truth at the core of these characters, who should seem quite familiar to anyone who's ever so much as visited a similar neighborhood, but their personalities are so thoroughly overinflated that at some point they cross a hidden line and become straight-up cartoon characters. The storyline, which seems to have plenty of fuel to burn in the setting alone, is strangely preoccupied with other things. What seems like a simple side story, about the creepy neighbors in the big, spooky, haunted house, instead dominates the entire picture, taking the film in weird, obsessive directions. Hanks is good as the weary everyman, deeply curious but terrified of confrontation, and he enjoys good help from his supporting cast Carrie Fisher, Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun work well together as the not-quite-cordial neighborhood welcoming committee. It's strange to see Corey Feldman, just four years removed from The Goonies, as a hard-drinking, home-owning Spicoli clone, but it works for him. Excessively nutty and silly like any number of the era's comedies, if perhaps somewhat genre-confused.

Its mix of an Amblin Entertainment style suburb and innocent horror blend perfectly and the script is consistently clever, even though the end is never quite pulled off. When a bizarre family moves into the neighborhood, their middle of the night activities raise suspicions amongst a group of neighbors until their snooping leads them to believe these new neighbors might be murderers. Hanks, Dern and Ducommun make a great trio and their efforts in getting to the bottom of these nocturnal goings on are usually hilarious. The 'burbs has a premise that writes itself into a corner by the last few minutes. There's equal evidence these strange neighbors are psychos and also could be innocently misunderstood, so any resolution outside of leaving it to the viewer's imagination is bound to come across a contrived disappointment. But then again, if the script offered no resolution, the film would feel incomplete and the viewer would be robbed of an ending -- so, it's really impossible for this film not to be written into a corner and while the last few minutes fumble character motivation and logic, the preceding running time works effortlessly. It's my favorite work from Joe Dante.

Corey Feldman is another actor that is in my top 5 favourite actors list. I always thought that he didn't get the recognition that he deserved. When he was younger he was an amazing actor, with a very impressive CV. I love so many of his movies. I have actually met Corey twice now. The first time I met him he was really friendly and very chatty. I spoke with him and Corey Haim that day. It was so good to meet them and tell them that I loved their work. The second time I met him, he was not as nice. He pretty much ignored me. He signed an autograph for me, but basically sat on his mobile phone texting someone and laughing with his friends. I would understand if I was bothering him in the street, but he was at an official signing. It was a disappointment. But that does not take anything away from him as an actor. He is still in my top 5. Carrie did a good job in this movie. She played Toms wife. I found this very difficult to come to term with. I don't know why, they just didn't seem to go well together. Maybe I am still struggling to think of her as Princess Leia. I should have got over that by now.

Do they keep you awake at night with strange going-on? Do they only make appearances at night? This is what Tom Hank's suburbanite Ray Peterson encounters when a creepy new family move in next door. The 'Burbs is an outrageously spontaneous and lunatic black comedy by film-maker Joe Dante who satirically pokes fun at suburbia by playing on the paranoia of a comfortable lifestyle being disrupted. Ray Peterson is on vacation, but he decided to stay home despite his wife Carol nagging him about heading away to relax. But this is no peaceful vacation when he, along with some other concerned neighbours observes the strange happenings next door at the Klopek's residence. When one of their neighbours disappears they believe the Klopek's have something to do with it and they decide to take it in their own hands to proof it. It's one-joke premise really milks out the idea with its slapstick gags, cutting dry wit, ghoulish horror overtones (with some neat horror film homage's / references) and a touch of old-fashion mystery where comic actors Tom Hanks, Rick Ducommun, Bruce Dern, Carrie Fisher, Henry Gibson, Wendy Schaal and Corey Feldman add to the fun. Watch out for colourful cameos by Dante favourites Dick Millar and Robert Picardo with Rance Howard, Franklyn Ajaye and Nicky Katt. Sometimes its momentum does halter, but I think it does lose its edge by trying to cram a lot towards the end. I though it's build-up promised something more than what it actually delivers. Still watching how it plays out remains constantly amusing. It's masterfully photographed with vivid art direction consisting of atmospheric set-designs and Jerry Goldsmith's playful music score.

Imagine goofy suburbanite neighbors with a over active imaginations, add strange new comers, and you can get where it's going.Most of the action takes place on the outside set, and it really gives this small neighborhood a lived-in feel. With the different point of views, and each persona well integrated, the whole place quickly becomes real in your mind.It's definitely from a late 80s mold and it doesn't go out of its way to break it, but it has aged well. The story line is interesting, and the antics of our eager spies comical enough to make us easily forget that it is getting old.There's only two scenes I don't like. 1) Art's over eating. Movies often over do it when it comes to food, and food noise, but that's ridiculous. At least, it's all located in a single spot and it doesn't spill over the rest of the film. 2) The husband and wife fight which is poorly placed to serve as a hinge.Finally, I only realized last year that the wife of the main character is Carrie Fisher, miss Princess Leia herself. After Star Wars, it got difficult to pick her out of a lineup, and this movie is a good example of that. She's not a bad actress, she's just a plain one.It's good entertainment, if you don't mind the 80s or if you're a fan of Tom Hanks.

Yes, it may be cheesy, it may be obvious, and some of the characters in it may be more than a little irritating, but for the most part this is a fun-filled thrill ride tinged with Halloween chills and a healthy dose of paranoia.Of course, the real joke is the supposedly ordinary neighbours who spend the movie spying on the newcomers inhabiting a ramshackle old house are far more bizarre than the would-be villains of the piece. Tom Hanks is the everyday Joe who's taken a week off work and becomes increasingly unhinged as the film progresses; Carrie Fisher is his ever-exasperated wife. Rick Ducommun, who bags one great gag-scene in which he threatens to eat his neighbours out of house and home, is the loudmouth conspiracy nut. Bruce Dern in a particularly inventive piece of casting is an ex-army loon with a fine line in gadgets, and Corey Feldman, who has grown up a lot since THE LOST BOYS, is good fun as a teenage slacker.The creative casting alone is reason to keep watching, but Joe Dante brings a lot of life to Dana Olsen's script. Dante has a natural love of cinema in all its forms which makes even his clich√©s seem like a lot of fun. The ghoulish antics surrounding the creepy old house are often hilarious, like the scene involving the femur and the neighbourly house call. Henry Gibson steals his scenes as the sinister doctor and watch out for Dick Miller in a particularly engaging cameo. The climax is completely spectacular and ends the film on a real high, paying off on all the kooky tension that's come before it.

An environment where you know your neighbours and enjoy your neighbourhood? Not according to this movie!Ray (Tom Hanks) is your average suburbanite. He has a quiet life with his wife (Carrie Fisher) and family. He's trying to spend a quiet week of vacation at home when a couple of his buddies (played by Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun) convince him that there's something suspicious about the new neighbours who've moved in next door. They've been there for a month; no one has seen them. The house is run down, the grass is unkept. An elderly neighbour has suspiciously gone missing. Something must be wrong. The movie basically unfolds the mystery of these new neighbours and it does that pretty well, so that once they're introduced you do go back and forth between thinking that they're just plain weird and thinking that they're weirdly sinister. Director Joe Dante builds this well. The first hour or so is really fairly low key, and the last 45 minutes starts the buildup to a wild and chaotic conclusion.There are parts of this that are quite funny. I don't know why but the scene in the strange house, when Ray and his wife and friends finally show up to introduce themselves, really worked. I don't know what was so funny about watching Ray eat a sardine on a pretzel but that had me laughing.I enjoyed Tom Hanks. This was still fairly early in his career, and he showed the talent that would eventually lead to his two Oscars. He captured his character well. In fact, the only part of this movie that I really didn't like was the role of Ricky (played by Corey Feldman.) I didn't think either Ricky or Feldman added anything of importance; both became rather irritating after a while. But that aside, this is a fun and quirky movie.

He graduated from the Roger Corman School of Film, and quickly made a name for himself with Piranha and The Howling. Even non-horror fans saw his work in Gremlins. Dante was a master of horror... with a comedic edge. And that is where this film comes in. Really much more of a dark comedy than horror, we have Tom Hanks, Corey Feldman and Bruce Dern (with a special cameo appearance from Corman graduate and Dante regular Dick Miller!)...Is this Dante's best work? No, not at all. After Gremlins, it is hard to top that... though, he has made some good things since (Gremlins 2 and Matinee come to mind, and even Screwfly Solution was pretty decent). But this is probably not the worst of his work -- it is very fun, very enjoyable and silly in a way that makes it a good film for both kids or adults (or adults with children inside them).Roger Ebert says, It's hard to put your finger on exactly what's missing from the movie. And that is somewhat right. He ranks it much lower than I do, but it is very much true that it seems that the film is so close to greatness, but almost fails. What is missing? I do not know... but I do know it is not Carrie Fisher, who is not used to full effect, but may help court the geek viewer.Whatever is missing, it is better to enjoy a half-baked Joe Dante film than a fully-baked film fro ma lesser director. Where else will you find Tom Hanks interacting with such a motley crew, digging up the yard looking for human remains?

Most are positive, and they are spot-on correct this movie is fun, funny, deliciously weird and wicked, and merits repeated viewings.Strange, but I barely got around to watching the movie at all, because it was always listed in various TV guide listings with a below average rating, so I thought it must be some mediocre piece of fluff, not worth watching. But when I finally got enough inertia one fine day to actually watch it, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it really is.The likable things about it are already enumerated in the previous positive comments. A few things I'd like to add it is a movie with a real gravity to it, in that it really pulls you into this thoroughly ordinary, yet oh-so-weird little neighborhood, and never lets go of you. None of it is believable, yet you just can't tear yourself away from the ride, as if you are magically strapped into a ride through a well-designed haunted house at the local theme park.I also like the way the movie builds on the slightly paranoid neighbors watching their neighbors theme (which is pretty common in most any neighborhood) and takes that idea to a deliciously twisted extreme. Many of us who live in close neighborhoods have probably experienced the constant scrutiny of our close-by neighbors (and we probably return said scrutiny upon them, too, whether we realize it or not). This movie makes a biting commentary on that human curiosity. (Hmmm, are the Robinsons over there digging up potatoes from their garden, or are they potting their mother-in-law??)Finally, (slight weird digression here...) if there was only one thing I would have added to this movie, it would have been to incorporate that great song People are Strange, by the Doors &#150; that would have worked nicely as an additional mood setter. That thought struck me while watching The Lost Boys (a great vampire film in which, by the way, Corey Feldman also appears). In the opening segment of The Lost Boys they play a stylized version of that tune to awesome effect. Nicely done! Just a thought...

Perhaps it could be considered a darker, funnier predecessor to the suburbs of American Beauty.  What I personally love about The 'Burbs is that I sort of know some of these characters in one form or the other.

The plot is very basic and won't be the reason to watch this movie. It's the characters, the suburbians that steal the show, portrayed by some awe-some comedy actors. And somehow it all falls on it's place and makes this movie a real enjoyment to watch. I've watched it a couple of times now and it still cracks me up, never gets old.Tom Hanks takes the role of Ray Peterson, a man around his 30's. Got 2 kids, a nice wife and a great house on this peculiar street. Ray is on a 2 week vacation, but he doesn't feel like going anywhere. He tells his wife he just wants to spend his free time by hanging around the house, watching TV, doing basically nothing. His character immediately reminded me of a stoner, in fact they should've made him one. All that needed to be done was giving him a big reefer in his hands, and a couple of plants in the garden. Anyways, the house next to Ray has new people living in it since a month now, and the strange thing is that nobody ever saw a single one of them, nobody is ever leaving the house and no one has ever entered it. How do they get their food one wonders. So Ray and his fellow suburbians are going to find out who the heck those people are and what they are up to. His party members consist ofMark Rumsfield ( Bruce Dern ), a Vietnam veteran, still thinking as a die hard soldier and acting accordingly. For me this is the funniest character in the movie.Art Weingartner ( Rick Ducommun ), The big mouth know-it-all neighbor. Who can show up uninvited just to get some food or a beer. He is the one that starts the conspiracy theories against Ray's neighbors. According to Ray's wife, Art's influence changed the person she married.Ricky Butler ( Corey Feldman ), The high school kid. Enjoying everything that is happening in front of his house from the safety of his porch. He even invites his friends to come over and watch the show, while his brave neighbors are investigating the strange next door neighbors of Ray.Further more you have your typical old grumpy guy, and the hot chick which happens to be Mark's wife.So in this flick you are following these people in their quest to unravel the mystery of Ray's neighbors. Things get really intense when they find out the grumpy old man Walter Seznick ( Gale Gordon ) has disappeared and off course they all think the Klopeks ( Ray's neighbors ) have something to do with it. The movie is full of great one-liners and colorful characters. You will constantly laugh out loud and will have the urge to watch it again.Get this hidden gem and you definitely won't regret it !

That vintage scene stealing presence with a charming innocence was exquisite method acting by the American, in which his child was trapped inside the vulnerable adult figure. Of course you only have to visit a few years back for his last comedy if you can call The Lady-killers that. Dark reality humour encoded but his awkwardness peeked through in perhaps the Coen's worst picture.Nevertheless here we were in 1989 having come back off the monumental success of Big and Hanks was up and running towards Hollywood stardom and this Joe Dante picture showcased much more of the comic genius of its central star.With a plot spilling out mystery about quiet and non fundamental neighbours this is a perfect example of what society in the suburbs is reflected as from an outsider's view. You only have to flick on the TV to see the same representation in a sitcom such as Desperate Housewives or a film in Little Children to find gossipy neighbour's prying eyes over their fence for a good nosy at everyone else's dirty laundry.The Burbs' sensationally capitalizes on this conformed ideology of the nosy neighbour by parodying all the way through by running delicious gags at how formula and formality gets shaken up by the arrival of the unknown. This is simply staggering, the benchmark to judge what is and isn't out of realism.Spilling with parodies, over the top pranks and marvellously hyperbole suspicions about the activities, this is vintage physical comedy with people getting hit, top actors screaming silly and dog mess on the front lawn.But if this sounds a bit over the top then no need to worry as come the end there are so many turnarounds you'll be spinning and a wonderful shouting emotion from Hank's Ray that you know he is telling the truth and everything never feels the same again.Dante adds wonderful spice to this picture. Opening with a conventional bird's eye view of the suburb we see his intent to make everything normal but then when the mystery builds and the wind blows at night with the garbage can then the director lets his exuberance flow and this flies from normal everyday life to wondrous fantastical comedy horror with some splendid sets and a purposeful tension overflow for extra laughs.Hank's is brilliant as is everyone and everything; this is splendid comedy and a true reflection with an added spice of misrepresentation.

He, along with fellow dimwits Dern and Ducommun, set out to prove his suspicions right; with pretty much hilarious results.Director Joe Dante always has a big humorous side to his movies, even in his relatively straight horror flicks Piranha and The Howling. In the latter he even managed to cleverly make fun of self help groups so evident in the latter part of the 70's and early 80's with great results. Here the folks in suburbia take quite a beating and the stereotypes depicted are not flattering at all.As for the jokes; most of them work really well. The 'burbs is also quite stylishly creepy at times, especially during the night scenes early on and a well realised dream sequence. Tom Hanks, Rick Ducommun and especially Bruce Dern are all having a good day here and supporting players are no eye sore either (Carry Fisher still looking quite lovely).As said, I may have done the movie in with too many viewings but the fact remains that this flick is very funny and combines well horror elements and relatively goofy fun.Highly recommended.

It's a neighborhood much like any other with neighbors who may act and look like misfits. I'm sure every street has one. I actually have nicknamed the misfits on our street the 'Klopecks' after the the ones in the film. It toys with the concept that you are never to sure who your neighbor really is. They could be murderers for all you know. This is what sets the tone of the film and it was actually used as well when Robert Bloch wrote the original Psycho novel.

However, one anomaly holds true in my mind that comedies made today are just not clever enough anymore. I am a big fan of nineties and eighties comedies because they took a basic premise and ran home with it to make it surreal (much the opposite of how comedies work today, take a surreal concept and beat it like a dead horse). The 'Burbs is a perfect example of this. I've been watching this comedy since I was five and (although my understanding of the jokes has grown immensely) I now not only enjoy the speaking jokes but the sight gags from my childhood still give me fits of giggles. You see there is a certain fondness given to each character in this, they have subtle behavior ticks that is used to it's fullest potential. Be it Art's overconfidence in his capability in various situations or Mr. Rumsfield's ridiculous veteran antics it all meshes together to make a believable silly neighborhood filled with colorful characters. The execution of various scenes is top-notch, the writers tactfully navigate the different scenarios with finesse you can't find today. Every attempt Ray and Art execute to try and expose their new neighbors is handled in a manner that will make you smile every time you recall. And rather than ending the jokes at the climax and going serious like so many comedies do now, they make some of the best jokes in the final act. It is a hilarious affair that, without giving too much away, involves some of the best physical comedy and use of character insanity to create a potent blend that you will never forget. It's not perfect, I personally find that Art can be a little obnoxious at some points, but it is definitely worth anyone's time who want to be entertained all the way till they roll on the floor.

What he doesn't realize is that throughout the next week he's going to be living in a comedic hell.Teamed up with his buddies Art and Rumsfield, the boys spend the week spying on the new neighbors, the Klopeck's, who have been inside for a month and have never come out. The three suspect them as murderers as they begin discovering more and more clues about the Klopeck's, until Ray is finally pushed over the edge and they decide to clean out the Klopeck's once and for all.Full of wit, humor, and genuinely creepy thrills that will send shivers up your spine, The 'Burbs creates its own unique mix and in the end, is able to pull off the perfect balance of its scary moments and humorous ones. Some of the jokes do misfire but the script is loaded with them, so you'll be laughing at least every 2 minutes. Each character does great in their role (espcially Tom Hanks), although Rick Duco...something does nothing more than average job in his hilarious role.The showdown at the end is excellent, the truth behind the veil of the Klopeck's mysteries is lifted and is probably the best scene in the whole film (although the the scene where they visit the Klopecks is a close second), and in the end you are just...smiling.So while The 'Burbs is nowhere near perfect (some of the scary moments are far too scary, the story is usually at a standstill and a handful of the jokes can misfire), the 'Burbs is a wonderful film that you will want to watch over and over just as I have.

In a street of mutually complacent, smugly democratic neighbours comes a rogue family of unknowns, whose differing life style, secretive manner and foreign manner invites suspicion. Feeling their overtures are rebuffed, 'our' side concoct increasingly bizarre suspicions and allegations against the new arrivals, driving them into isolation until damage and conflict inevitably occurs after increasing ostracisation... Alert viewers may notice an amusing similarity of names Art Weingarter - Caspar Weinberger (Reagan's hawkish Secretary of State), or see in Bruce Dern's Vietnam-eccentric a broader caricature of the military complex which frequently inform American national debate, in which foreign policy is often shrill, polarized between support of those we know and deep suspicion of those we don't. Others have expressed disappointment in the ending which, although neat enough, is conventional and a little false, primarily due to it running against the previous scheme of things. I felt the same disappointment incidentally at the end of Lehmann's Heathers (1989) of the same year, when I really wanted that whole rotten school demolished by explosives, corrupt institutions and all) The reason why the end of The 'burbs feels odd is that it leaves the allegory considerably compromised by a last minute reassurance that yes, We were right all along - while Ricky's final 'I love this street' is enough to urge viewers that, with all faults, America is still the best place to be. But, especially in this modern world of increasing intolerance towards other cultures (by both sides), and some mistaken assumptions as to the intentions of 'rogue states', on to well known, controversial adventuring abroad, it's worth seeing this brave film again.

The way Joe Dante directs this film is perfect it hold the tone of a late 80's/early 90's flick, yet still has an ageless essence that everyone can relate to.Tom Hanks plays the type of role that suits him best; an everyday guy that faces some kind of huge task (in this case it's proving that his neighbors are human sacrificing devil worshippers). Bruce Dern plays my favorite character, a militaristic Vietnam veteran who is filled with paranoid fear about the people across the street (and he never fails in delivering hilarious one-liners. Example Smells like they're cooking a goddamn cat over there!). Rick Ducommun fits perfectly as annoying, yet oafishly good humored friend of Hanks' and is really the one responsible for the suspicions they all share about the Klopeks. Carrie Fisher, Corey Feldman, and Courtney Gains round out the cast of believable, average citizens.The key to enjoying the film is in being able to relate to it. If you can't relate to this film, chances are you won't enjoy it.

The crime shocked the world and provided a none too subtle acknowledgement that Hanks the serious actor didn't value his comedic counterpart's abilities. In effect he was saying 'look, I take myself far too seriously to contemplate being remembered as just another comedian - I want gravitas, respect from my peers, er, Oscars. Oscars? Any chance do you think?' Unbelievably there was. Playing everything from AIDS victims to the retarded and lets not forget a gangster(!) Hanks proved that Hollywood does indeed reward its own for worthy performances, just a pity that the audience is an afterthought. Hanks is not a great serious actor. His name says dependable but never exciting. One thing he was good at was comedy, in fact as the everyman who gets dropped into the most unlikely situations he had an unbeatable niche which unfortunately for us he tired of sometime in 1991. Nowadays Hanks looks back on comedies like 'the 'burbs' with a faint wisp of embarrassment - the way you and I might look at Baby photos of ourselves. In a telling interview circa 1999 with Mark Cousins on the BBC's scene by scene, in which actors talk about their movies while looking at clips, he gave the game away by describing the burbs sarcastically as 'a great film'. Too bad - because Dante's divine comedy (do you see what I've done there?) is great and worth 4 Philidelphias or approximately 15.3 Forrest Gumps at the current rate of exchange.Its smart, witty stuff - notable for its clever references, particularly the nod to once upon a time in the west and anchored as ever, by Hanks' everyman, gradually losing his grip in the midst of an escalation of disturbing circumstances. Watch it and think of what once was and wonder how different life might have been if someone had had the guts to say 'Tom Hanks for the AIDS movie? Don't be bloody ridiculous'.

Joe Dante delivers a fantastic madcap film set in the suburbs that pokes gentle fun at the foibles of suburbanites (without derision) and shows them worthy of defending. The film is a celebration of suburbia and suburban values - such as the value of being neighbourly (embodied in Mister Rogers, whose show appears partway through). Tom Hanks is Ray Petersen, and unassuming everyman whose suspicions of his sinister new neighbors blossom into a life or death struggle to protect his cul-de-sac. Featuring a host of familiar faces (including Carrie Fisher, Rick Ducommun, Henry Gibson, and Robert Picardo) the movie keeps a steady pace of action, funny dialogue and slapstick humour, all the while unfolding a mystery with wonderful melodramatic camera work and score. One of the things I love about this film is that the characters of Ray, Art and Rumsfield are very believably normal, excitable and goofy guys who come to save the day without much in the way of talent. One of the few flaws I found in the film was Corey Feldman. Admittedly, he's funny now just for being Corey Feldman, but his character irks me, and acts as little more than a running commentator on events that explain themselves. It seems that he was tacked on, perhaps even to, I don't know, appeal to a younger demographic in marketing the movie. The only noteworthy point he illustrates, that ordinary life can be entertaining to watch, is adequately implied elsewhere in the film. I might mention that the movie reminds me of the novel 'The Last Coin' by James P. Blaylock, and I can affirm that both can be enjoyed again and again.

All we really know about Ray Peterson is that he's on a two-week summer vacation from work.

In THE BURBS, this ordinary man stumbles onto an extraordinary mystery when a strange new family moves in next door.  The ordinary man/extraordinary situation device was perfected, of course, by Alfred Hitchcock, and Hitch seems to be the main inspiration for director Joe Dante, who masterfully weaves the darker, suspenseful scenes with hysterical comic touches.  An under-rated gem from the early, lighter days of Tom Hanks. "},{"Title":"Flawed but addictive.","Date":"13 April 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  The opening credits of The 'burbs give us the impression of a film that could turn out to be extremely witty. It's about a small suburban neighborhood in Middle-America comprised of a bizarre array of really wacky people. Tom Hanks plays the main character, an amiable guy who has taken a week off of work, and is now just sitting around the house all day in his PJs, suspecting that his new next-door neighbors are hiding something. Another one of his neighbors, a paramilitary nut with no war to fight (Bruce Dern), decides to investigate a little - and they soon believe that the family is a pack of murderers.As the film progresses onwards it becomes a bit dumb, especially towards the very end, which was allegedly re-filmed after test audiences did not like the original climax. Maybe they should have kept their mouths shut.The pack of apparent murderers is led by Academy-Award nominee Henry Gibson, who is one of those great underrated characters actors, and who always manages to creep out the audience without having to say anything at all. The movie leads us to believe that he is a murderer. What's awful about the end is the twist - or how sloppily it is presented. I would have bought it; I would have been surprised by it, if it didn't seem so forced and unbelievable. I started wondering whether the whole ending was a dream sequence. Much to my disappointment, it was not. But just now I thought of a way that the film might have ended that would have sustained its dignity and actually shocked people instead of embarrassing them with its ineptness.I will not lie The 'burbs is pretty mediocre, and I can understand why many people might dislike it. Yet as with many comedies from the '80s, it carries a sort of charm and is almost criminally fun and easy to watch. I just watched it again at 1250 a.m. this morning, having not seen it for quite some time, and it not only held my interest, but I learned to appreciate the movie for what it is - again.The 'burbs was directed by Joe Dante, a man with a lot of wit and talent at making dark camp films. The Howling, which I disliked, was nevertheless superbly directed; Gremlins, one of my favorite films, was dark, humorous and smart; Small Soldiers was the perfect example of a unique idea helmed by a man who knew what he wanted; and The 'burbs is just about the most solid example of Dante's style. Mixing elements from Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg, Dante is one of cinema's better directors, if only because he is great at presenting us with crazy material and doing it tongue-in-cheek and not taking himself too seriously. He's a man with a lot of imagination that crosses over onto his celluloid; I don't think he's as much as a mainstream sellout as he is an old-fashioned storyteller, like an old man who gathers around a campfire at night and tries to scare his audience, but manages to insert some laughs for good measure.What propels The 'burbs past simple fun and into the realm of strangely addictive and satisfying viewing is the subtle genius of its plot. We all know about those closely-linked neighborhoods where everyone waves at each other in the morning as they collect their papers in their PJs, where the grass is always neatly-trimmed and green; where the newspaper boys always randomly throw papers and miss their targets by at least five feet; and the sort of neighborhoods where everyone is always watching everyone. The 'burbs is a movie with a lot of good idea, never sampled before or since in any mainstream production I have seen. There will always be movies with the stereotypical suburbs, but rarely will there ever be a movie that mixes them in with the core idea of The 'burbs - that the people in these suburbs all have quirky traits, and all take spying on each other to an extreme level; to such a level that they would suspect a strange new neighbor to be a mass murderer. One day after mowing your lawn you just snap! Hanks shouts towards the end of the movie. The 'burbs is at its best when it's toying around with the suburb clich√©s and at its worst when it is distracted by tacky subplots. It's technically a rather poor movie, and I can understand why it received negative reviews in 1989. But fifteen years later it stands as an enchanting, but flawed, film that has an undeniably watchable undercurrent flowing through its veins. If this movie were on TV a week from now I'd probably watch it again, just like I have been for years.3/5 stars.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Good casting, funny script, laugh out loud comedy acting.

Having seen the film many times, my appreciation for it only grows with every consecutive viewing.  My respect for its director, the darkly witty Joe Dante, also grows with leaps and bounds.  A film that may be written off as campy 80's schlock at its first viewing, closer inspection inevitably reveals something more calculating and sinister.  Dante has managed to harness suburban paranoia and turn it against his audience, making them see things that may or may not be there.  His direction also successfully captures the growing paranoia within his on-screen characters, and it seems like the neighborhood becomes darker and more sinister as the movie progresses.  Through all of this he maintains the ambiguity of the focus of the paranoia, the Klopeks.  Are they murderers or not?  Almost the entire movie can be viewed from either perspective, as the answer is only revealed at the very end of the movie.  All the elements are very reminscent of another director who turned fear and paranoia against his audience numerous times in numerous ingenious films.  That director is of course Alfred Hitchcock.  The term hitchcockian has been thrown around enough times, many times quite undeservedly.  In THE 'BURBS, the term finds a perfect home in a movie that would have done Hitch proud.  Is THE 'BURBS campy? Yes.  Is it dumb?  Not remotely.  Joe Dante weaves a intelligent narrative out of Dana olsen's shrewd script that holds us in with amusing characters and comic suspense.  He guides us along, letting us see what we want to see, waiting for the true answer.  That answer only comes at the very end of this aptly-described Hitchcockian film with an ending that is very -to coin a phrase- Dante-esque.

Starting the movie, I knew nothing about the plot, what genre it fell into, or even a vague sense of what it was about. As the movie started, I was captivated by the interesting characters, the engaging dialogue, and the spot-on on satire of suburbia. After the first fifteen minutes, the movie took a sharp left turn. Every scene and every joke became painfully obvious. During the build up to every humorous moment, I found myself saying aloud what was going to happen. On top of the movie's predictability, I found it highly frustrating that the characters continually discovered seemingly incriminating evidence, but took it upon themselves to play police detective. There is a certain piece of evidence, in particular, that the family dog discovers, but the characters just chalk it up as a potential misunderstanding. In real life, if you find this type of evidence, you don't discuss it, you call the police. This ridiculous denial of hard evidence absolutely ruined the movie for me, not to mention the over-the-top, near senile, ending to a monstrosity of a movie. I didn't expect greatness from this movie when I began watching it, but I did expect to be entertained. Instead, I suffered through it because I felt vested and was constantly hoping that it would turn around and surprise me...but it never did.

This was still fairly early in lead Tom Hanks' career, so his comic/nervous traits rather than the thoughtfulness of his later performances are at the fore here. He mainly comes off as amiable, and is nicely supported by Carrie Fisher as his wife and, playing the neighbors, military-minded patriot Bruce Dern (to this end, composer Jerry Goldsmith knowingly incorporates cues here from his classic score for PATTON 1970!) and overbearing goofball Rick Ducommun.The various situations which see the three men attempting to determine what goes on at the mysterious house next door &#150; especially after yet another neighbor (whose dog everybody hates) goes missing &#150; are both inspired and funny. Best of all perhaps is Hanks' nightmare, brought on by an occult tome penned by one Julian Karswell (Dante's films always involve some cinematic in-joke, in this case referencing Niall MacGinnis' formidable villain in Jacques Tourneur's NIGHT OF THE DEMON 1957), which has him being barbecued during a satanic rite! Others have physically painful repercussions on his associates Ducommun is electrocuted while trespassing onto the eccentric neighbors' property, whereas Dern (distracted by teen Corey Feldman and the pals he brings over just for the occasion) falls off the roof &#150; with rifle in hand firing away! &#150; during one of his strategic maneuvers. Equally hilarious, however, is a scene highlighting Dante regulars Dick Miller and Robert Picardo as garbage collectors &#150; having seen the neighbors' hirsute kid put out the trash the night before, Ducommun and Dern think the bags may hold the dismembered body of the missing person, so they climb into the garbage depository of the van and proceed to throw everything back onto the pavement! When they finally get to meet the Klopeks (including obligatory mad scientist Henry Gibson and the sinister-looking Brother! Theodor as, well, his elder sibling), of course, the latter come off as daffy but essentially harmless. Even so, our heroes aren't satisfied (Hanks' dog digs up what looks like a human thigh-bone from the garden next door) and, when the neighbors make an infrequent trip out of town, Hanks and Ducommun take the opportunity to search the house &#150; but only manage to hit a gas pipe and blow up the house! At this, Hanks has had enough and, though bandaged up, physically assaults Ducommun &#150; this scene, in which Hanks denounces suburbia as both prejudiced and paranoid, suggests that the film may have had a serious intent after all; that said, it ends by proving Ducommun right &#150; as the Klopeks, who arrive on the scene just then, reveal themselves for the monsters they truly are! At the end of the day, this surely emerges as one of Dante (and Hanks') most satisfying efforts; for the record, apart from adding the same director's INNERSPACE (1987) to my collection (after having also recently acquired the two beloved GREMLINS movies), I'll be following it with his EXPLORERS (1985) and HOMECOMING (2005), the latter being the first of two entries Dante helmed for the Masters Of Horror TV series&#133; "}{"Title":"Nice setup.

Mark's a Vietnam vet who treats the neighbourhood like a battlefield. And Art is a walking encyclopaedia on gruesome murders.The Klopek's odd behaviour and appearance spurs our threesome into action. And their ambition to unravel the mystery turns to obsession until all hell breaks loose.The Burbs is quite an enjoyable film for about three quarters of the way through. I liked the way Joe Dante directs the events. The change in the characters emotions from harmless curiosity to outright paranoia is very well conveyed. And Dante has great fun shifting tones.There's something almost Hitchcockian to it, with a little black humour thrown in for good measure. A fellow neighbour goes missing. A human bone turns up in the back garden. The Klopek's themselves look like extended cousins of the Addams family. And inevitably things erupt into chaos.Because of Joe Dante's cartoony style of film-making, things do sometimes overbalance into childish farce. But for the most part, he keeps things going at a brisk pace.If you look hard enough, there's a hidden subtext the film touches base with at times. The town of Hinckley Hills is a suburban conformists dream. Neatly trimmed lawns. Freshly painted homes. And then a family moves in that couldn't be more different. The idea is that the townsfolk are upset by this interruption into their ordered lives, and want to restore the delicate balance. That idea comes out a bit muddled from time to time, but when The Burbs gets its priorities right, its a very good film indeed.Its such a shame then that the film takes a nosedive in the final act. At the end, the Klopek's home is blown up thanks to Ray's nosiness. The Klopeks witness this. And in that one moment, you feel real sadness for them. You realise how wrong you've been. They've lost their home thanks to some stupid people who couldn't respect their privacy and just leave well enough alone. Tom Hanks makes a very angered (if heavy-handed) speech about their own stupidity. They're the ones climbing over fences, breaking into people's homes and even blowing them up. They're the real lunatics.If the film had ended on that note, it would have been much better. But instead it cops out with an entirely false ending where the Klopek's were the bad guys after all. It sends out the strange message that Ray & Co's antics were completely justified. And that is an ending I just couldn't buy into.What a shame! The Burbs had the potential to be a scathing attack on the lives of suburbia. And with anarchist Joe Dante at the helm, I thought it couldn't go wrong. If only he had the courage to see things through to the end, he could have had something really special here. Dante explored this to far greater effect in Gremlins, and in the wonderful suburban paranoia TV series Eerie Indiana.Oh well, fun while it lasted! Still, The Burbs has much to recommend, especially the wonderfully wacky film score from the late Jerry Goldsmith. Just don't be too surprised if you feel entirely cheated when the credits roll.

Tom Hanks stars in his usual everyman role, this time as the man convinced that the neighbors are up to something.All in all, I would agree with a previous reviewer that this would be a neat movie to experience (as are all of Joe Dante's movies).

Not to say that it is the best movie of all time, but rather my favorite.  I am often skeptical when someone says that their favorite movie of all time is something like the painfully overrated Shawshank Redemption, or a true classic like Citizen Kane, The Godfather, or even contemporary best picture winners like A Beautiful Mind or Forrest Gump.  I think that while some (and I do stress SOME) or these movies have more accomplished casts, a better plot, and in some cases revolutionary filmmaking, they aren't really people's favorites.  They aren't movies like the Burbs' which one can watch time and time again and continue to laugh or think of past times watching the movie.  They aren't movies that one is likely to watch every two months or so, or sit down and watch them at 300 AM if they happen to be on.  The movies that people watch at 300 AM are movies like The Burbs'.  These movies are funny, hold sentimental value to the watcher, and are easy to watch over and over again.Now onto precisely why I like The Burbs' soooo much.  First and foremost it is a funny movie.  The characters, especially Bruce Dern's are all quirky and deliver some good lines.  For example when Bruce says, There go the god damn brownies! after he part of the Klopeks porch collapses, it makes me laugh...hard.  It's in his delivery.  Like I previously mentioned sentimentality also plays a big role.  I have fond memories watching this throughout my childhood and now into college.  I lived in the suburbs all my lives and find some of the characters though somewhat cookie cutter images, to be accurate.  I really like the Corey Feldman character, and every time I go outside to do yard work, or paint the house (like he does), I pan the block and hear that song in my head (I don't know the name, but the heavy metal one he puts on that goes I am your war machine....).  Tom Hanks is great in this movie also and some of the stuff he says like I believe a man's furnace is his own business., is priceless.  My Justin and I like to fill our conversations with Burbs lines.  He particularly likes the lines offered by the grizzled uncle Reuben; even his harsh No. is a favorite.No, this movie isn't going to win alot of awards or be held in high regard in most circles, but it should be.  Just the way the characters interact with each other is funny.  The Burbs has a certain charm about it that allows me to keep watching it over and over.  It doesn't rely on gags that may make the viewer howl with laughter the first time they see it but fade with future viewings.  Instead it relies on funny lines delivered Hanks' funniest outing.  For God's sake this is a Corey Feldman movie that is good! While some of you are bound to disagree that this movie is very funny, I kind of like it that way.  I like that the Burbs is kind of developing a cult following (not a really big one, but big enough that I run into people that really like it).  I like that this movie has it's own little audience. It's proof enough to me that movies like The Burbs will live on in the minds of millions as people's favorites of all time.  I know it will live on for me.

See, the Klopeks never go outside, don't socialize and strange sounds emanate from their cellar in the dead of night. And one day, old Walter has disappeared, his hairpiece left as evidence of the crime.So what else is there to do for bored Tom Hanks, the fairly reasonable central character, chubby pal Art, who's wife has gone for the week and Vietnam vet Bruce Dern, who's just looking for an excuse to relive the good old days, but to investigate. Fueled by Art's speculations and following a disastrous soiree with the Klopeks, Hanks decides to take matters into his own hands and make the neighborhood the safe haven it once was.The result is a quirky, light-weighted comedy with good all-round performances from the cast, some great lines, but it's the tone of the movie that I like best. Lazy summerdays, well-to-do citizens that have mowed their lawns to perfection, no, boys really, boys who are looking for adventure and believing it's lurking on the other side of the fence.

Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), his wife Carol (Carrie Fisher) & their young son Dave (Cory Danziger) live there & about a month ago a mysterious family called the Klopek's moved next door to Ray & his family. No one in the street knows anything about the Klopek's, not even how many of them there are. The Klopek's are strange neighbour's, they've never introduced themselves, they don't take care of the house, the garden is full of weeds & dead trees, bizarre lights & noises emanate from their basement, they dig holes in their back-garden at night during rainstorms, Ray's dog Vince digs up what looks like a human thigh bone from their back-garden & they even manage to act suspiciously merely taking out the rubbish.

Dante manages to keep things moving & really pile on the paranoia as the film progresses without giving too much away & he creates some great scenes which contain both comedy & tension. The well thought-out script by Dana Olsen is almost perfect, it's interesting & entertaining, it feels refreshingly different, it moves along at a great pace & is never boring or dull. I love the idea of Hanks being the normal sceptical guy who manages to twist ordinary situations into something sinister as his idiot friends put crazy ideas into his head. The use of paranoia is excellent throughout as we find out what's going on as Hanks does, by the time The 'Burbs finished I was thinking up lots of crazy solutions & scenario's as well! All the characters are fun & likable which helps immensely to just become lost in their crazy world. I also thought The 'Burbs was an incredibly funny film throughout, the dialogue is littered with some absolutely terrific one-liners & is just entertaining to listen too. I love the scene when they introduce themselves to the Klopek's for the first time, the way they all just sit in a really awkward silence as Reuben (Brother Theodore) stares menacingly at Hanks, Hanks eventually breaking the silence by talking about drainage. Or when Hans (Courtney Gains) offers him a raw sardine which Carrol makes him eat. There are many, many more examples of great individual scenes & sequences throughout The 'Burbs which had me quite literary laughing out loud & it's not often a film makes me do that these day's. There is a definite dark streak running through The 'Burbs, it has some cool creepy horror elements & tries to make us think about who the strange one's really are, the people who don't conform to a certain way of living & society in general or the people who persecute them because of it. I just love the way The 'Burbs is constructed & how it all builds up to a slightly over-the-top & somewhat silly ending which is the weakest part of The 'Burbs but still works & is a satisfying enough way to round the film off I suppose. There is no real gore in The 'Burbs but there is are brief sequences from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) & The Exorcist (1973) as Hanks imagination is fuelled even more by late night horror films on T.V. which we catch a few shots of, there are a few human skulls as well. There's a fair bit of swearing & language too so I'm not sure it's suitable for all the family. The acting is great from everyone, Hanks is brilliant as the hero & really likable as the ordinary man living a boring life in suburbia who lets his imagination run riot, Cory Feldman makes an appearance as Ricky Butler one of the neighbour's & surprisingly even he is good in it, a great cast for a great film. On the negative side The 'Burbs is a little bit silly at times & one or two of the characters were a bit annoying on occasion, but these are small quibbles generally speaking considering The 'Burbs is just such good, funny entertainment. Technically The 'Burbs is strong with a great atmospheric Church organ sounding main theme by Jerry Goldsmith, good photography, editing, special effects & production values. Overall I love The 'Burbs, it's fantastic fun that I never seem to tire of. Highly recommended as something a bit different, quite thought provoking at times with a great speech by Hanks at the end & all that's left for me to say is watch it as soon as you can!

Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun lead the charge against the mysterious, foreign-sounding people (Henry Gibson, Brother Theodore and Courtney Gains). There's a good satire at the heart of it, about xenophobia and general mistrust of so-called regular people, but Dante misses it for the most part. The neighbors are, in fact, a freakshow. He way overdoes this aspect. Their yard and home is so unkempt (they've only lived there a month, yet all their grass and trees are dead), I would imagine the police would have at least given them a citation by this point. When we actually meet the people, they all seem to be out of 1930s horror movies. The rest of the cast overacts terribly, too. Hanks may have been very popular in comedies at the time, but he really was a pretty poor comic actor. Ducommun is particularly annoying (yeah, he's supposed to be, but he shouldn't make me want to turn the movie off). Dern was the only one who was kind of funny, but he plays too much of a nutjob to be one of the heroes of the picture. Most of the movie is actually pretty watchable, if unremarkable, but the final act is not only anticlimactic, but retracts the well-observed moral of the story.

It's not as mindless as The Bachelor Party or The Money Pit, though. There is quite a bit of rattiness in there. As the title says this movie is about suburban life and it gives a good roasting to the bored, nosy inhabitants of the 'burbs.Tom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, who is somehow the hero of the story and the leader of the neighborhood. He always acts as if he was the reasonable guy when he's really no different from his acquaintances. He's a henpecked husband and he spies on the Klopeks, the strange new people who moved in next door, just like everybody else does. Ray and his friends suspect weird ongoings in their new neighbors' house and begin to investigate the disappearance of Walter, an old man from the block.Besides its satirical look at small-minded small town-folk, The 'burbs is first and foremost a light comedy with countless classic one liners and hilarious characters, all embodied perfectly by the respective actors (I always thought that Dan Aykroyd would have made a great Art, but Rick Ducommun also did a fantastic job).Director Joe Dante, the man who had also made Gremlins, Innerspace and Explorers, is a master when it comes to making dark adventure movies, so The 'burbs has more than just a touch of that, too. As Peter and his pals begin their investigation with all their supposed cleverness and their military spying toys one feels like watching The Goonies, except with grown men in a grown up world. (Speaking of The Goonies, Corey Feldman is in this movie, too, in one of his last great roles as the neighborhood's meatball MTV kid.) We, the audience, get sucked into the adventure ourselves. We also want to know whether the Klopeks are just cranky people or if they're really hiding something. We become just as nosy and shameless as Ray's little troupe.The 'burbs is a bonafide classic and deserves a much higher ranking on IMDb. FACT!

Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern), teenager Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman) and often paranoid Art Weingartner (Scary Movie's Rick Ducommun) all have their questions about a house on the block. The family known as The Klopeks have lived in the mysterious, dreary looking old house across the way for a little while, but nobody has been seen any come in or go out of the house, and no-one knows what is going on inside with family members, there are suspicions with all the strange noises. Ray is on a long home vacation, and with his free time he decides with his neighbours that they should try and communicate with and bring out the strange family to answer their questions. It turns out it not just the house that is peculiar, but also the family themselves, with weird Dr. Werner Klopek (Henry Gibson), hick looking Hans (Courtney Gains) and elderly oddball Reuben (Brother Theodore), they even get to go in the house that is reasonably alright, but there is obviously awkwardness trying to get to know them. Eventually, with all the bizarre goings on, to the protest of their loved one, including Peterson's wife Carol (Carrie Fisher), Ray, Mark and Art decide that they should break into the Klopek compound and investigate all over, especially the basement, and find incriminating evidence of foul play, e.g. bodies or bones. In the end it at first looks like they had the neighbours all wrong, and that the big disaster is their high paranoia taking over and making them the weirdos, but actually Dr. Klopek was apparently murdering, as they find skulls in his car trunk, so it turns out alright for Ray and the good guys in the end. Also starring Wendy Schaal as Bonnie Rumsfield, Dick Miller as Vic the Garbageman, Star Trek Voyager's Robert Picardo as Joe the Garbageman, Gale Gordon as Walter Seznick, Bridesmaids' Franklyn Ajaye as Detective #1 and Mars Attack's Rance Howard, Ron and Clint's father as Detective #2. Hanks is fantastic with his overacting being mad and complaining, Ducommun is likable as the slightly moronic and theorising friend, and the other cast members are okay as well, it is essentially a conspiracy kind of thing played out like a humorous mystery with slapstick and weirdness thrown in, all in all not a bad comedy. Good! "},{"Title":"It'll give you nightmares.

I concur up until a certain point (otherwise I wouldn't even have written the comment), but surely it's predominantly a comedy effort; in particular a pitch-black comedy and a satire of the most quintessential type. It may not be obvious at first, but The Burbs is actually very reminiscent to Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands (or vice versa, since the latter came after), as both films cleverly and not-so-subtly parody the typical ambiance & lifestyles within American suburbs. Both films excessively juxtapose the sickly jealous, overly noisy and fake-friendly suburbanites against the supposedly outcast new arrivals, and rapidly come to the conclusion that they are at least equally weird, if not weirder. Ray Peterson, a typical neighborhood fanatic with a week of holiday to relax and work in the garden, quickly joins his extremely paranoid neighbors with spying on the new Klopek family. Admittedly the Klopeks act a little weird, like dig up the garden at night and beat up the garbage cans, but Ray and especially his friends (a tactics-obsessed war veteran and a chubby guy obsessed with murder stories) are pretty deranged themselves. The Burbs thrives on over-the-top comical situations, far-fetched misunderstandings and delightfully grotesque acting performances. The pacing is quite energetic and doesn't allow you to contemplate too much about the exaggeratedly stupid concept. The horror elements of the film are obviously very soft, still the sequences inside the macabre house of the Klopeks are quite atmospheric and the set-pieces (all the stuff in their basement) are effectively sinister. Deep down in his heart, Joe Dante primarily remains a horror-director, so his fans also this means that The Burbs is literally stuffed with slick references/tributes towards classic genre films and real-life terror. The giant family dog is even named Landru, after the infamous French serial killer! Nowadays Tom Hanks is a highly respected actor and frequent winner of prominent awards, but personally I'll always prefer his joyful 80's comedies. Hanks is truly terrific in this role here and he's got a superb supportive cast to back him up, including familiar names like Bruce Dern, Rick Ducommun, Carrie Fisher , Henry Gibson, Cory Feldman, Courtney Gains (the creep from Children of the Corn) and Dick Miller. The Burbs is by no means classic cinema, but an irresistible and charming piece of entertainment nonetheless.

If you want a film that will intrigue or inspire you, stay far from this one.The film centers around three utterly unlikable suburbanites Hanks as bland weenie Ray Peterson (could the filmmakers have picked a more generic white-bread name?), Ducommun as grating slob Art Weingartner, and Dern as a wacky over-the-top veteran Rumsfield. The film could have gone in any number of clever directions with these characters, but they are all very dull and 2-dimensional. Ducommun's character fails to ever be clever or amusing, instead just being obnoxious with no payoff--many viewers tend to mute or skip through the drivel featuring him. I hoped that Rumsfield would be quirky and interesting, but he's a very stereotypical and predictable character. Thankfully, Hanks turns in a passable performance, but Ray is such a dull everyman character that we never become invested or even interested in him.The plot involves the protagonists becoming suspicious of their Eastern European neighbors, the Klopeks, and ultimately trying to prove that the Klopeks are psychotic murderers. Cheesy, predictable and slapstick hijinks ensue. The protagonists are too selfish and mean-spirited for us to like or care about them, and so there is no tension or suspense to draw you in. At the end, the movie looks as though it will feature a satisfying twist about the self-righteous, xenophobic main characters being proved wrong and having to own up to their mistake. Unfortunately, they are all proved right and vindicated in their small-minded, nasty outlooks.The film starts out with plenty of promise but goes nowhere; its ending, however, makes it utterly irredeemable. It sends an unpleasant, stupid and destructive message that people who don't conform to the privileged white American's way are insane and criminal. If you pay any attention to this film at all (instead of just using it for background noise at a party or something), you will find it either nasty or pointless.

It definitely wasn't award winning but sometimes you have to do the fun film.  I also loved how the movie played with people's paranoia.

This is because there is no setup or explanation required for what is going on; the humour is supposed to be instantaneous.  We see something that is weird on screen, and we laugh because it is weird, also in the knowledge that whatever's on screen will go away shortly.   There is potential for comedy to be found in the premise of The 'burbs, but unfortunately the script fails to extract any of it.  I know the ineptitude of the film can be traced directly back to the quality (or lack thereof) of the script, because director Joe Dante is capable of crafting great entertainment given the right material (Gremlins, Innerspace).  There are also a number of usually reliable performers here struggling with the weakness of what they are given.  The paucity of the end result that reaches our screens can be explained by the approach that the script tries to take.   This is a feature film, so some attempt should have been made to flesh out the main character, to make the audience relate to him.  You have a basic plot here, USE IT!  USE IT TO AT LEAST HALF OF ITS FULL POTENTIAL PLEASE!!!  There is no need for the humour here to be instantaneous like a sketch show, because we're working from a much broader canvas where the plot can even be established before the humour arrives.  The 'sketch' analogy that describes the approach of the movie presents various problems which dog the film throughout its running time.  In a sketch, we laugh because something is weird.  In a film, we expect the comedy to originate from the situation that has been presented to us.  Too often in this film, we are shown things that are strange, and are expected to laugh because of this, despite the fact that their importance to the situation is TOTALLY arbitrary.  The situation would still be the same if they weren't there, they're just thrown in to make us laugh.  I would say though, that if you can't develop the situation competently enough so that it makes us laugh on its own, without the aid of cheap gimmicks, then comedy isn't your forte.  That's a message to the writers...  Also, as I said, we laugh at a sketch because we know it will be over shortly.  It should be obvious that the funny parts of the sketch are not strong enough to be sustained over a longer period.  One of the worst things about watching The 'burbs is that if you don't find the 'awkward' weirdness funny (as you can surmise I didn't), you know that the execution period won't be mercifully brief, unlike a sketch.  It was an awful moment when I realised I had to sit through this unfunny tosh for AT LEAST another hour and twenty minutes...   If you like the idea of stupid events that don't sit well with the overall plot of the film, then you might like this.  The rest of us will just scratch our heads in wonder at why anybody might enjoy a comedy that is otherwise laugh-free.

I loved Henry Gibson, and you shouldn't be able to go wrong when you have Brother Theodore in your movie. But Tom Hanks, I'm sorry, is not a good actor, and despite what many of you may say, an Oscar does not exclude someone from such criticism. He's simply exceedingly mediocre, and casting him as a mediocre person does not help matters. Steve Buscemi, as evidenced by the movie The Big Lebowski, would of made a much better choice in terms of making a dull person interesting. Corey Feldman, well, I just don't like him. He hasn't made a good movie since The Lost Boys, and even that one's up for debate. His part seemed to of been as a sort of narrator, then the script got changed after he signed up. In other words, his part was really unnecessary, get rid of him. But most of my rage goes toward Rick Ducommen, who plays the annoying neighbor. Now some people, Randy Quaid for example, can make an annoying character likable. Ducommen's portrayal is simply annoying for the sake of being annoying, and I find myself using the mute button a lot when he's on screen. That said, I enjoyed most of the characters otherwise, especially the Klopeks themselves, but they receive so little screen time, and a majority of the movie was spent hanging out with these people I did not want to hang out with. Now, perhaps this was the point of the movie, that suburbia makes you dull and have to hang out with people you don't like, but that doesn't give the filmmakers the right to both bore and annoy me with it. The production design is also top-notch, but a pretty piece of crap is still a piece of crap. All in all, I recommend you FFWd 50 minutes, when we finally join the Klopeks, and keep the FFWd button handy for when they're not on screen from then on.
