(Dir Peter M. Cohen) Amanda Peet is a star on the rise and has proven to show true comic potential as previously displayed earlier this year in `The Whole Nine Yards' where she held her own with co-stars Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry with her own natural charm not belied by her prettiness.  However in this debacle of the dating game wars between the sexes she is left to her own defenses in arguably the worst 'comedy' of the year and maybe the worst film of the year period.Four immature moron buddies - Brad (Van Holt), a brogadaccio Wall Street slickster; Zeke (Abrahams), a downtown artiste wannabe; Jonathan (Abrahams) a seemingly closeted homosexual with apparently no occupation except his extracurricular mastabatory schedule; and Eric (Domke) the pudgy, married doofus - who meet for Sunday brunch in a downtown Manhattan greasy spoon to pontificate on their sexual prowess and the degradations thereof.  Each tries to trump the other (all by the way having nothing in common except being egotistical jerk-offs) with their weekly exploits and embellishments that give bull***t a new meaning.Then one week the three bachelors find what they each think is the perfect woman and declaring she's the one; this must be love.  If you can't see the sub-sitcom level approach leading to the ultimate plot device of them all loving the same woman then you're about as smart as a piece of furniture (or in this case one of the male leads here).That woman is Mia (Peet) who also isn't terribly bright or lacking any scruples when the trio stumble onto her apartment one fateful weeknight and bicker about who's going to stay.  Somehow the foursome agree to continue dating one another only to escalate the testosterone stupidity several dozen notches which leads to a friendship showdown and.oh never mind!  The `twist' at the end is that Mia turns out to be a player in her own right and the `lesson' is supposed to be that she uses them just as they have used women before. The film is such a mess and amateur filmmaking at its worst.  The script is just riddled with expletives at the highest decibel with the four idiot buddies screaming at one another and just plain nasty overall.  There's absolutely nothing funny about this attempt at a male `Sex and The City' approach with nothing clever, original (its bare-bones format is a la `Diner' which is likening `Citizen Kane' to `Porky's' which is `Citizen Kane' compared to this crap!) or memorable except Ms. Peet deserves better as do we all.To quote Roger Ebert on his notorious panning of Rob Reiner's`North' `I HATED HATED HATED THIS MOVIE!!'

And I rarely give 1's. Even for the lamest of movies I look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, it's humor, even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible. Looking at it within it's own genera or subgenera. But there is absolutely nothing redeeming here. I can't remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I made it to the end was because I couldn't seem to change the channel - I sat there simply aghast, watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next. It was like watching a snake digest a rat. But let's have some fun and pull this baby apart, shall we. First of all, There is nothing technical about Whipped that works. The visuals are all sitcom style. The cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over. The music and score, not only doesn't contribute anything to the movie - it's obnoxious. Not to mention it doesn't have anything to contribute to anyway. The acting is as cardboard as it comes, all around and that goes for Amanda Peet (clearly the star that got this train wreck green-lighted) too. These guys, supposedly good friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director Peter M. Cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting.On the creative side, there isn't an original bone in it's body. It has no imagination. It shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before. The whole premise, or twist, of this movie is based on male-bashing and the idea that an empowered women can play men just as they get played. Anybody, that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a TV before. Twisted, shallow women are common. Male-bashing is the norm. It's not stealing from anything specifically, it's worse it's stealing from clich√©s. I can't imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt. Makes me want to go rent In the Company of Men - or better yet, There's Something About Mary. This movie wants to be a edgier version of There's Something About Mary so bad you can see the sweat. The movie has no insights into women, men, dating, sex, or really anything. Cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies. On the other end, the movie doesn't work as a satire either, because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as satirical it doesn't have that grounding in reality that satires need. It doesn't even know what it's satirizing. Then there's the dialogue, which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other.  Example Character 1 F**k you Character 2 Oh yeah, well f**k you (repeat)And the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all the other discretions There are a lot of movies without plots, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus, been good. Whipped ain't funny. Not for a second. It has no comic skills or timing. The situations are all completely phony, not based in any shred of truth, especially enough to wring laughs out of us. The characters all broadly drawn so they will SEEM relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator. Just look at the marquee scene, cult classic hair gel scene. One of our bumbling anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena (Peet)'s vibrator. For some reason light shines down on it as if he's found the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators I do not know. While he rubs it on himself, he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when, oh my, Mena walks in on him. Oh, my sides. But strangely enough, people actually like this movie. Of course, people also like Friends and reality dating shows so I shouldn't be surprised. All of this has a common thread however. Whipped is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex. They will like any show or movie (or think they like it) just because it is about dating or relationships. It's lack of any quality has no baring on these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating/relationship related to sell them cheap, empty, effortless TV, movies and any number of products.  The only consilation will be that when I die, because I saw this movie, I've got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back.

Amanda Peet has proven that she can act, as she was a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'.  So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole.  However, the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny.  If you can forget about how underpar the production quality is, and if you find smut jokes funny, then you should be all right.

The outtakes include cast members laughing at the 'hilarious' mistakes they've made, and things that went wrong on the set of this 'comedy.' Glad to see someone laughing in someway, with some connection to this 'film.'Nothing in this film is funny. Nothing. It just goes on, and on. It's truly that lame. I love films that are so bad they're good. This is so bad it's...something, but I don't know what, and hopefully will never find out.Amanda Peet doesn't suck outright, and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film.

I saw it had gotten many awful reviews containing very colorful expletives on how much it stunk. Of course this meant I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised as Whipped is actually rather a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed Hollywood fluff comedies. This is an independent film and as such portrays its subject matter (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood fakery. I distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will depend very much on their experience of life. If you've never dated or partied much you won't get this movie because you won't have met people like these characters. If you have, you'll recognize many of the situations that portrayed here in comedic fashion. The ending was also good, as it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virginal romantics in contrast to many Hollywood movies.

They use to meet each other once a week together with their married friend Eric (Judah Domke) to tell theirs dates, affairs and sex experiences along the week. Brad and Zeke are greater lovers and Jonathan loves to self-masturbate. One day, each one of them tells the others that have met the perfect girl. Indeed, they come to realize that the girl is the same, Mia (Amanda Peet). A great dispute among them will shake their friendship. A funny surprising end will conclude the plot. This is a film that looks like that is based on the teenagers of `American Pie', when they have grown up. The `low level' and scatological jokes, the concept of relationship with a woman, the focus on sex,  the entire screenplay seems to be `inspired' in `American Pie'. However, it has many funny moments and will certainly entertain the fans of movies like&#133;'American Pie'. My vote is six.

But the one I liked the most (until maybe the last scene) was Amanda Peet.  She has a charm that is all her own, like cameron Diaz had in There's Something About Mary.  And she is pretty good through the whole movie, until the last scene, where she shows her true colors as a woman with all the integrity of all 4 lead women in Sex and the City.  The only difference being that in Sex and the City It's a chick show because it focuses on the women and there needs.  This film is actually mainly a guy film that they can relate to, except that the end can kinda give a guy some low-self esteem (especially after the outcome).

This is definitely a B movie - the plot is thin, but the one-liners and sexual banter are a hoot. Amanda Peet has great comic timing (if you haven't seen The Whole Nine Yards, do it) and Brian Van Holt, Amanda's real-life boyfriend, is a total hottie (what a great ass).

The directing is not up to the task the four adventures are rather cut than blend together. Except the shy and expert wankker, the characters aren't interesting but highly unbelievable. Amanda is the only good thing here because she seems natural and brings her usual smile and kindness. The fan of the big apple would be happy too because there's a lot of exterior stuff.

I was actually quite disappointed by this flick. The story was a fairly standard, role-reversal-type plot that made the supposed justice of the final twist totally unimpressive. Amanda Peet, who was presented as the high point of the film, had maybe 2 minutes out 90 to really show her talent. And I was especially disappointed by how seemingly unimaginative the 4 main male characters were. How many more times do we need to see the hapless married guy who lives vicariously through his still-swinging single friends?

What a wild idea. What a radical, naughty gal. Women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to. As much as men do, even! There is one solitary laughable element in Whipped - namely the fact that not once, during the amigo's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash, do the other customers in the diner turn around and say, Dude, we're trying to EAT here. Indeed, a heh-heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages. A big fat Kermit the Frog Sheesh to that.It's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting, a smart, cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop-out ending.P.S. - 30 whip-oosh sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase You go, girl.

Whipped is also what writer-producer-director Peter M. Cohen should be for bringing the world this fiasco.In it, three obnoxious and unbearable single friends, in addition to always being on the pull (though one of them usually spends his time talking to the hand), spend their Sundays hanging out with their mutual obnoxious and unbearable married friend and talking about their sex lives. The single guys later each meet Miss Right, and later find out that they're all dating the same woman; it's a tribute to Miss Peet that you can understand why they fancy her - not only is she lovely, but she's the most (and arguably only) appealing character in the movie. SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT...Even in the twist ending where she tells HER friends she was playing with the men all along, basically giving them a taste of their own medicine - which, incidentally, was not far off from what I suspected (the fourth guy talks about his wife but we never see her, and I figured that she was his wife and he was setting them up) - instead of thinking that she's just the same as them, it's difficult not to think that those jerks well and truly had it coming. SPOILER ALERT OVER... SPOILER ALERT OVER... SPOILER ALERT OVER...Plus, her vibrator joke in the outtakes during the credits is far funnier than the one in the movie (unless you really think rummaging around in a urine-filled toiler bowl for a buzzing vibrator is the height of humour). Or anything else in the movie, for that matter. Relentlessly crude, filled with facile emotions and not even up to the standard of the worst-ever Friends clone, this is a movie only Miss Haversham could love.

We meet Brad a good-looking, wall-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp tongue; Zeek a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric the married guy, who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence.  The trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in New York are amusingly expressed, mirroring that of Sex in the City and HBO's new comedy The Mind of Married Man, and bring an astute light to scamming. The story takes a twist as the three singletons meet Mia--wittily played by Amanda Peet-and all fall for her. She seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities' they exhibit. When they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman, they chose her over their friendship. Whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world, one that the critic's failed to recognize. In plain language, they missed the point. The protagonist's here are caricatures of real people. The exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests. See this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish.

I don't have a problem with profuse cursing, as in Good Will Hunting, provided it helps to delve more into the characters.  In this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional *gasp* or laughter from the audience.  The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype, the wall street jerk, the coffee house jerk, and the I'm-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side slightly-less-of-a-jerk. You just don't give a damn about any of them!  They are all shallow, unredemable losers who you WANT to see lose.

It essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters.  With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you cannot stand any of them.  The film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric, moronic, and crude.  The only slightly amusing character is Eric, whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on.  The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet.

So, I convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me. This review is my penance.In the first act we have the three lead studs, recounting their conquests in a diner. What should have been funny, or at least telling, comes out rather pathetic. Was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this?And while I don't mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar, I kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details. They do this every week at the same diner? You would think someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot two other diners do notice in one scene. But this is just a setup for a punchline. Everyone else in the diner is deaf.The second act has the three studs all falling for Mia and then developing brain rot, failing to ask each other or her about what's really happening between the four of them. And I kept asking myself, as the studs keep acting like they have been, what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date? Does she start out with brain rot? I kept hoping for Eric's character, the married buddy, to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act. His role is clearly to dispense advice on being married. But why do they even bother to talk to him when they won't talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh!The third act resolves what plot there is but by this time I was looking at my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and I had to agree. The Scene That Explains All was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list. (Oh, okay, that's why Brad had that happen and Jonathan says this and...)What laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing.

There's a way to make a crude, tasteless comedy and deliver laughs; and there's a way to...just make it crude and tasteless.  Whipped tries to be Swingers without the wit or intelligence.

Just watch a Whit Stillman film and you'll see the difference.  Not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish.  If you know any successful, white-collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie--please let me know and introduce me to them.  Their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty.  There is absolutely NO insight into relationships, sex or...anything!!!

There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by (straight) men and play out wonderfully.  This scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures.  It involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman's mouth.  It was one of those noticeably-written-by-a-guy scenes.  I wasn't believing it for a second.  Whipped is purely a sick male fantasy that's as flat as it is annoying.  I got (very) few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy, and those were probably a result of desperation.

One has an ego the size of an elephant because he has money, the other thinks that his niche is the fact that he hangs out in coffee houses and reads Nitzche and then the other is actually a nice guy but he is influenced by his friends.  These are the kind of guys that will pick up a woman, have sex with her and then forget about her.  It doesn't matter that she may be heart broken and devastated, all that matters is that the boys had a good time and got what they wanted.  But what happens when a woman comes along that has a similar agenda on her mind?  What happens, is you get a smart, hilarious and insightful comedy called Whipped.Whipped is full of smart insights into the single male and the married male.  It starts off with four highschool buddies that meet every weekend for breakfast to discuss their whoring ways.  Everyone is single except for Eric who has been married for several years.  I think that even though he is played strictly for laughs, there may be more truth to his character than I know seeing as I am not married yet.  But he is one of the funnier elements of the film.  He likes to hang out with the boys because he vicariously lives through them and their exploits.  He would never cheat on his wife, he loves her, however, it is good to hear about the thrill of the hunt. Brad, Zeke and Jonathin are the other three friends in question and the three of them all fall for the same woman, Mia, played by Amanda Peet.  She meets all of them in conspicuously suspicious circumstances but they never seem to realize that fact.  Zeke ( the artsy type ) meets her at his fave coffee house.  Jonathin meets her outside a magazine store where he buys his porno mags and Brad meets her at a club where he likes to strut his stuff.  All three fall hard for her but she tells them that she likes all of them equally and she can't decide who she wants to date exclusively, so she wants them all.  Since they all like her so much, they all agree to this.  Complications ensue.Amanda Peet plays Mia as a soft, kind hearted woman.  You really believe that she is in love with all three of these guys and that she really can't make up her mind.  You have empathy for her and you can accept her plight.  Two of the three guys are pigs and you hope that she doesn't end up with them but then at the same time Jonathin is just as scheming as they are so it is hard to route for him.  But when the payoff hits you, it comes at you with a comic force that is refreshing.  I have read reviews in here that have chastised the film for what it tries to say, but I admire it.  I don't think I have seen a film that does what this film does and says what it says so confidently.  The comeuppance that the three receive is justice to all the jerks that have perpetrated guys like this before.  I think women will laugh at this film and most guys should like it as well.  I'm not sure why it is getting all the bad publicity but when I saw it with my fiance, she liked it just as much as I did.This is a funny, honest look at dating and revenge and it is very enjoyable.  The denouement is perfect, with every character.  Even Eric, the married man has a funny story about his time with Mia.  She is, after all, irresistible.9 out of 10-- This is a very funny film and if you like Amanda Peet, this is one film that highlights her talents as an actress.  Don't listen to what anyone else says about the film, judge for yourself.  This is a very funny film.

The award this movie will ever so justly take home is the distinction of being the worst movie of the summer, or possibly the year. This movie was a typical Hollywood money making device. First you find a star,(Amanda Peet) coming off the success of a very popular movie, The Whole Nine Yards. Then, you release a movie she made almost a year earlier to take advantage of her name. I often wonder to myself why I go to see these movies I call hidden disasters. Most of these movies that were in the can for so long should be kept in the can.  I would love to comment on the plot for you, but this movie forgot to put one in the script.  The one bright note I can take from this movie is that Amanda Peet is a good actress when she has the support of a good script and accompanying cast. (see Whole Nine Yards) On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a solid 2 for the amount of quality minutes this film contained.

You'd have to be a real masochist to want to spend 80 (and thank God they are only 80) minutes in the company of these characters, who seem to possess the emotional maturity of 5-year-olds, and whose vocabulary consists of about 20 words (the most popular ones have four letters and begin with f and d).

The entire structure is based on some supposedly snappy sex-tinged dialog and the reverse of the scam-the-scammers. Because of the first part of the latter, it is often compared to `Company of Men' but that completely misses the point of the reversal. No matter, if this could have had value, it would have been in the diner, in what happened there among these four guys and the movies they weave with their stories. Some of this DOES have edge the pair that screws and steals, the fabrications of the masturbator. But it doesn't have nearly enough to justify spending time with. `Red Meat' is vastly superior in this regard.I watched this because Amanda Peet was very effective in the one `fulcrum' scene in `Igby' where she meets her lover and is rejected, all soundlessly. Effective film drama that she inhabits. No skill or charm here however.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

But the men here are a particular set of men, three best friends who meet in a small diner in NYC for brunch every Sunday and brag about their conquests the night before. The premise could have provided an entertaining and insightful film, but this one is too vulgar and shallow. I admit, I laughed at quite a few of the jokes, because certain toilet humor I find funny. But the filthy language is mostly gratuitous and the interaction among the three best friends, especially after they discover they have fallen for the same woman, is not believable.Moralistically the film is trash. It depicts sex as a sport and marital fidelity something to be joked with. In the end, Peet's character is discussing the three men with her girl cronies at a table in a restaurant, making fun of their equipment, and explaining that she had targeted them only after she witnessed their scamming three young women in the park on Sunday One of the eight-week period of this film. So, I give it credit for some smart writing and a few funny situations, but overall it is a shallow and sophomoric film that is unnecessarily vulgar to the point that it no longer is entertaining. In fact, Freshmen and Sophomore high school boys seems to be the target audience.  See it for an example of how distasteful a current film can be, but don't expect to like it.

Even the diner scene, where two elderly women referenced to Ocean Spray products, was like the old lady in When Harry Met Sally... (1989), when she wanted to order the same dessert Meg Ryan had.  Neither of the three scammers has the machismo of either Shaft, James Bond, or Austin Powers, but with Amanda Peet as the woman to think twice before asking her phone number, one would have the impression that everyone should see Martin Lawrence being stalked by Lynn Whittfield in A Thin Line Between Love and Hate (1996).  The vibrator scene ended with a Truck Turner (1974) reference of exiting the bathroom stinkin', and throughout the film, there are a few instances that Amanda Peet was showin' her Whoopi Goldberg teeth several times.  Although the vulgar overtones wasn't the same as a Quentin Tarantino cult favorite (e.g. Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction), especially with Brian Van Holt as the ultimate QT impersonator as Brad (watch how he picks up his women, but no one can be like the original Shaft, Richard Roundtree), some might consider this classic as a throwaway, but as a result, I rather purchase a ticket for Saving Silverman instead.  Where's the good talent?  They should have casted Ben Affleck, Seth Green, and Ryan Phillippe instead, and die-hard Amanda Peet fans would have nightmares after seeing this film (not to mention Saving Silverman).

I'm fairly easy to please when it comes to movies, so I gave it a shot.  Big mistake.I went to the late showing at a high market multiplex, where I made up 50% of the audience.  I gotta tell you, I didn't laugh once. I guess I just sat through the movie, more or less stupefied, not caring what happened next and fantasying that it would turn into a slasher movie, where Freddie Kruger would come and kill them all (including the writers) and let me go home.  There is not one sympathetic character in the movie, not one funny situation, no surprises at all.  Just disgusting, if not revolting, behavior.  I think the theme is supposed to be that the woman turns the table on the boorish pigs, but she in fact, is the biggest boor of all. Now it might be that there is gender bias going on here.  It might be that women enjoyed seeing Amanda Peet acting like a chauvinist pig, hence the divided reviews.  And I, being a male, didn't.  All the charm Ms. Peet exuded in `Whole Nine Yards,' was totally absent.  I don't think it's her fault, it's the writer's.  Boorish behavior just isn't charming.

I've often wondered why the shorter films tend to be the worst (with the exception of Disney's better fare), since you'd think they'd have a nice, tight story with no lag.  But the reason these films are short isn't because they've got a tight story.  It's because they've got nothing to them, period.    This movie is billed as a comedy, but it's rarely funny and usually annoying.  Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams play Brad, Zeke, and Jonathan, three friends who meet on Sundays to discuss their scamming that is, using pretty much any method to get in bed with a woman, only to (of course) never call them again.  All this changes, however, when they each separately meet Mia (Amanda Peet of The Whole Nine Yards), a woman who appears to share all of their interests.    Soon, they all find out that Mia is seeing the three of them simultaneously.  Naturally, this leads to arguing among the three over which of them is actually seeing Mia.  She says she likes all of them (how surprising!), so they begin to each pursue the separate relationships.  Obviously, this is total hell on their friendship - except that for some reason it isn't for very long.    For an 80-minute film, there's really nothing to fill the meager body of Whipped.  Brad and Zeke are terribly annoying, and every character in the movie is one-dimensional.   Only Eric, the married friend who still wants to be one of the guys, is even a remotely palatable character - and he's very, very annoying.    Peet herself displays a rather limited range of acting ability.  Rent The Whole Nine Yards if you want to see her in a better role - the charisma she displayed in it is nowhere to be found here (it would be wasted even if it were).  But don't spend a dime to see Whipped.   I went to a matinee show for $4.75 and still left feeling ripped off (there were six people in the theater on the opening weekend - sign?).  The movie is only occasionally funny and never interesting, poorly written and not directed much better by first-timer Peter M. Cohen.  A number of scenes are tacked on, contributing nothing to what plot there is.  Cohen excessively meta-references to boot, sometimes an amusing tactic but more often tiresome.  This is just a bad, bad movie.    It's not only the worst 80 minutes since Blair Witch, it's probably the worst movie of the year.
