Not being a movie-goer or a TV-watcher, I had not yet seen (or read about) the movie, its excerpts, the original book, or the cast, although I had heard references to the summer of '42. After an intense work week, I had tuned into the PBS channel on TV to watch 30 minutes of a business news program, at the end of which, PBS showed that The Summer of '42 was next. I thought of watching it only for a few minutes - not really being interested in seeing a story from 62 years ago in a movie made 33 years ago. PBS played the movie without a break, and I sat through all of it - totally captivated. I don't think I can explain the reasons with a typical technical analysis. I think it held me in a trance, because it reflected my own coming of age. Even though I grew up in a different era, country, culture and society, there were many parallels to the drugstore episode, the furtive readings of the book, the carrying of the grocery bags, the storing away of the boxes, and the attempted fooling around inside the movie theater.I like a production (movie; theater; music) that reflects the reality one experiences in life. This movie was one of those rare productions. I felt it was quite artistic in its balance - the way it assimilated simple elements from everyday living, with a simple, but enchanting, musical score. The movie did not need any dazzling stage effects - Jennifer O'Neill was enough; and, even in her, the art and beauty was in her being so natural. In the end, I felt good about spending the time to see the movie.

The dialog between Hermie and his two teenage buddies wile exploring their emerging sexuality is a wonderful and hilarious, i.e., Do you think I'm in love with Vera Michaels. I hope I'm not in love with her. I hate her. Who couldn't relate to those things in our youth.Jennifer O'Neill, as Hermie's crush Dorothy, is gorgeous and well suited for her role. The scenes between her and Hermie go from funny and clever to sad and wondrous. One can only guess the emotions going on inside Dorothy's head when she finds out her husband has been killed in the war. I always felt she just wanted to experience closeness with someone during that time and Hermie just happened to be nearby. She also knew he cared about her and it was important for her to be needed . . . by someone.A glorious film and one I can watch tons of times and discover something different each time. Highly recommended.P.S. Michele LeGrand's musical score is beautiful. Just another plus for the movie.

Perhaps it is because I waited 30 years to view it and see so much of the young guy I used to be in Hermie that it is sort of frightening. One shouldn't look too deeply into a mirror of any kind. 	Most people reading this are going to be familiar with this old and well known story. Three young boys, all 15 years of age, are spending a boring summer on a vacation island in the summer of 1942. The lovely Dorothy, 22 years old and her husband away fighting the war, is hauntingly played by Jennifer O'Neill, fresh and very beautiful in the summer of 1972 when this film was enjoying it's impressive run in the nation's theaters. 	Dorothy lives alone and Hermie injects himself into her life, carrying groceries and performing odd jobs around her home. Director Robert Mulligan was wise not let us get to know Dorothy too well, as this allows us to feel the same mystique regarding her as Hermie feels, and it is through his eyes the key parts of this fine film are presented.  	Hermie was smitten with Dorothy from the beginning, but we are never allowed to think the feelings were reciprocated, much to Mulligan's credit, for Summer of 42 could very easily have been turned into something sleazy without his skillful and understated direction. Throughout the film, we see a view of the world through 15 year old male eyes. Life and love are overwhelming mysteries at that age and we are somewhat comforted by the fact that it is not until deep into the film that Dorothy, shocked and grief stricken by the telegram informing of her soldier husband's death, succumbs to a temporary but very intense emotion and introduces Hermie to a world he has only dreamt about. 	Everything comes with cost and we see Hermie and his buddies, themselves introduced to the world of females and relationships during this long summer, at film's end retreating back, for the precious time they have left for it, into the safety of childhood and teenage concerns.  	Perhaps this film worked as well as it did because of the presence of Ms. O'Neill. Her personal problems and anguish are well documented, and one wonders if some of this did not show up onscreen at this very early time in her life?  	An element of sadness hangs over Summer of 42 to this day. Robert Mulligan could not sustain the promise of  this film and The Others, a little known but wonderful film made during the same general time period,. Gary Grimes never had another Hermie role and certainly Ms. O'Neill never realized her vast potential nor ever again reached the excellence she did as Dorothy. Who knows, perhaps art did imitate life to come and that is what gives Summer of 42 its well deserved reputation.

My. God.What a stunning piece of craftmanship. A masterpiece. Such innocence. Such humanity. Such wisdom. Such truth. Such is the need to touch the soul of another, and such is the need to seek comfort. Yet tenderness risks so much. Oh to be tender again. Yet who could bear it again?I remember when I was eight years old and I remember what a splash this movie made. I don't really recall that I was told or even understood why, and of course I wasn't taken to see it at that age, at that time, when it was common to keep children ignorant of much they are not today. I'm not sure now that it wasn't the craving of the parents to let themselves drown in the strangeness that is naivety prolonged too long just for the sake of innocence itself rather then some strange desire to protect the children from things they could already begin to feel within themselves but were not allowed to mention or ask about. Though the latter is, even today, what is trumpeted about as the reason for shielding children from things they might not be ready for, I'm beginning to wonder if it isn't really the parents who are just protecting themselves, trying to squeeze out more childhood days from their children for the parents to enjoy before they must finally release their darling children into the fray that tides upon the whims of nature and destiny.This movie came out in 1971. Tonight they played it late on our local PBS station here in Dallas. I'd never seen it and not thought about renting it and watching it in all these 33 years since then.One might say it is simply about a couple of 15 year old boys coming of age. But it is more than that. So much more. In fact, without question, it is about the human condition itself. This is a movie about sex, no doubt about that either. But a movie of a kind that I don't think I've ever seen before. Everyone should see this film. Everyone. If you live alone, see it and feel your own soul's needs. If you live with someone, see it together and draw him or her close. Above all, when it is over, you will find yourself remembering and feeling that rarest of all feelings, true tenderness.The young men should have received Oscars, and without question so too should have the woman.

Robert Mulligan certainly had a diverse directorial career with such varied memorable films as To Kill A Mockingbird, The Great Imposter, The Man in the Moon and The Other and quite a few forgettable films as well. He certainly made a memorable one with Summer of 42. Mulligan brought Harper Lee's words to life in his wonderful adaptation of her novel in Mockingbird and he brings Herman Raucher's screenplay to life in 42. Two examples of very personal semi-autobiographical remembrances of growing up successfully brought to the big screen. Michel Legrand's music couldn't be any more perfect for this film. I was the exact age of the boys depicted in this movie when it was released so I could relate to this and the ethereal beauty as represented by O'Neil.

Hermie manfully struggling under the weight of Dorothy's groceries as they walk home,  Hermie trying to buy rubbers from the local druggist, Hermie trying to seem so grown up taking his coffee black and burning himself in the process,  Dorothy and Hermie dancing after she has received that fateful news. As I rewatched this film, all these years later, I was struck again by the scene at the end. Hermie is standing by that fence, a powerful symbol of boundaries, that which separates one place from another. We see how sex, and events have changed him. He is now a sadder and wiser, somehow older, soul. We hear Oscy droning on about his troubles with Marylyn. We feel Hermie's sense of commingled joy and pain and we truly realize the difference between trivial lust and life altering love.

It affected me to such an extent that I (a tough guy G.I., mind you) left the theater in tears and had to walk along the train tracks of Fayetteville, North Carolina, for half an hour before I finally regained my composure. It is a poignant film, wonderfully written, acted, directed, and photographed. The interplay among the Terrible Trio (Hermie, Oscy, Benjie) is quite funny indeed, and most men will relate to the boys' curiosity about sex. But the scenes between Hermie and Dorothy raise this film into an exalted realm of the cinema, capturing the human spirit with rare insight. Among bittersweet, nostalgic, coming-of-age movies, only this one and the brilliant (but sadly neglected) A Summer Story strike me as achieving such a remarkable level of honesty. The sequence after the War Department telegram arrives is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful, sweet, sensitive scenes ever to be filmed. To those of you who accuse the bereaved Dorothy of committing statutory rape, of being a pedophile, and other such stupidly nonsensical allegations, I say take your politically correct crap and stick it up your... (Sorry, I got carried away there.) It's just that I resent dirty-minded morons who try to ruin a sweet, poignant scene by calling it something that it is not. Dorothy is no predator. She certainly has not been lying in wait for Hermie. She is shattered by the news, she has turned to the bottle for solace, and Hermie only happens along, offering physical comfort and a husband-figure in her time of need. I find nothing at all offensive about it. In fact, it is a lovely scene that is handled by director Robert Mulligan with great taste and sensitivity. It could hardly even be described as sexual. Please make it a point to see this film. You will never forget it.

She isn't the world's best actress and only has 12 minutes of screen time, but is so impressive she takes your breath away. Gary Grimes is sweet and sincere as young, impressionable Hermie. The theme music is tender and touching and unforgettable. This coming-of-age movie bears no resemblance to today's crude horny-teen movies. It's funny, gentle, and sad. Highly recommended.

At the same time, I see this film as a sister film to both Lolita movies, because it takes the same vehicle of forbidden love and switches the gender roles. That is, both Lolita films project a grown man's belated adolescent fantasy coming true from a man's point of view, whereas Summer of '42 projects a grown woman's belated adolescent fantasy coming true from a woman's point of view. That is not to say that the creator of Summer of '42 plagiarized Lolita in any way. Both stories have their own unique plots, but the vehicles used in both films themselves are identical inasmuch as they hit upon stories of forbidden love that we typically hear about on afternoon talk shows or evening news programs. What I find interesting about one of the other comments on this website is that like the Humbert Humbert character in Lolita having a clear pathway of opportunity to Dolores Hayes, the character that Jennifer O'Neill plays in Summer of '42 has a clear pathway of opportunity to the teenage boy in that movie whom she has her designs upon. In the 1997 version of Lolita, no teenage boys ever seem to be around except in conversations between Humbert Humbert and Dolores Hayes. In the 1962 version of Lolita, I only remember one teenage boy making an appearance in that film and he did not have much of a role. In Summer of 42, as stated in that other comment, the teenage girls who the teenage male protagonist and his two buddies date are unpleasant and pose no obstacle to the character Jennifer O'Neill plays as for her intentions to cross the forbidden age line of love with the male teenage protagonist. Get my point? Authors and creators of these types of stories know how to protect their own plots without their audiences even realizing what has hit them. British author Beryl Bainbridge even whitewashed the presence of any teenage boys from her book titled Harriet Said short of a brief mention of a 19-year old boy the co-protagonist Harriet had met before returning to the village where she and the protagonist both resided. Summer of '42 is a genuine work of art. However, I still must say that the producer of this film and the producer of original Lolita were wise to have released these films long before the Pedophile Panic that came about probably around 1984. Too much censorship going on now and too much power being given to the Puritanical establishment.

His friendship with Oscar is completely believable of the way young teenage boys talked and related when I was a boy.Near the end of this film, there is a scene that lasts for nearly ten minutes with a complete lack of dialogue, yet it fits perfectly, and passes quickly.

So I found the DVD at my public library and popped it in the BD player last night.I wasn't mature (old) enough the first time to really appreciate this movie. It is a lot funnier than I remember it, but funny in a truthful way, the way it depicts 15-yr-old boys, on summer vacation, and more than a bit obsessed with the female body and sex.Gary Grimes at 15 played 15-yr-old Hermie, and the movie is shown from his perspective. He is on the vacation east-coast island with his two buddies Oscy and Benjie. Typical of a boy that age (I seem to remember) he caught a glimpse of a lovely woman, Jennifer O'Neill, 22 during filming, as Dorothy who shared a cottage with her husband. He was smitten and of course, being basically a shy boy with no illusions that a lovely 22-yr-old would ever look twice at him, simply lived his fantasy in his mind.However as young luck (when preparation and opportunity meet) would have it, Hermie happens upon Dorothy as she is coming out of the local grocery story, arms overladen with bags, and he offers to help and even carry them home for her. On a different day she asks him to help her place some boxes in the attic, all innocent on her part, but for Hermie it was almost like they were dating.The movie also has a few scenes with Hermie and Oscy meeting up with a couple of local girls, exploring their sexuality, but the main story is Hermie coming of age, so to speak.It is interesting that neither O'Neill nor Grimes achieved any particular acting fame after this, even though they are great here, in one of the more memorable movies of the 1970s. SPOILERS As Dorothy and Hermie get to be better friends and more comfortable with each other, Hermie tells her he will visit one evening. As he gets there he sees a fresh telegram, it was wartime and her husband died in France. She was distraught, she needed some comfort and Hermie was the only one she could reach out to. She escorted him to the bedroom and they shattered his innocence. The next day when he went to the house he found a note on the door, she had left, and in an adult voice-over signifying some years later, Hermie says he never saw her again but that his old self also disappeared that summer.

It wasn't until I had my own family that I realised how profound are the truths which are delivered so gently by this movie.Gary Grimes' Hermie is an everyman audience identification teenager (and so he should be, being a character based on the author's own experiences). As well as knocking around with his two friends, he also contrives to spend time with Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill), the young woman in the neighbouring beach house whose husband is away in the war. She recognises Hermie's crush for what it is, and kindly indulges him without ever being cruel. And so the summer goes on. Then late one day Hermie calls on Dorothy to find her deeply, but quietly distraught, having been notified of her husband's death. Without comment Dorothy takes him into her bed, and the next day she is gone, leaving only a note for him.There is no explanation for her actions, but adult sensibilities suggest an overwhelming need for physical closeness in a time of such extreme pain, and I think I didn't know this in 1971.The change from the gentle humour of the main story to the extreme poignancy of the closing section is vast, yet imperceptible, and conveyed with the best of taste. Grimes does well in communicating Hermie's naiveté and his almost-but-not-quite-understanding, and Jennifer O'Neill's shading from luminous beauty to ragged despair is heartbreak personified.

Like it or not, a double standard exists and reasonable people will recognize that similar is not always equal. Hermie was hardly the victim of a predatory pedophile. Since the story is autobiographical, the author would maintain he was hardly traumatized by the incident. In fact, he was so positively moved by it that he wrote a book recalling most fondly his recollections of that memorable chapter in his life. That the film touched a vast audience demonstrates that the story was more a true depiction of many a young man's fantasy than a tawdry and criminal act requiring condemnation. The bond between Hermie and Dorothy was one of mutual need in which neither should be described as a victim.

Even if the latter was overshadowed by the former in both awards ceremonies and, more importantly, its explicit depiction of youthful sexual encounters, SUMMER OF '42 is still a fondly-remembered look at the eternal issue that, badly handled, can create both controversy and embarrassment. That the film succeeds as well as it does is a tribute to its sensitive direction (Mulligan was both a DGA and Golden Globe nominee), Herman Rauch's perceptive autobiographical screenplay, its appealing cast of relative newcomers, veteran Robert Surtees' sunny cinematography and composer Michel Legrand's lovely theme (which earned the film its only Oscar). 15-year old Gary Grimes falls hard for 23-year old war widow Jennifer O'Neill during his summer island vacation even if all she requires of him at first is to carry her heavy loads around but, overcoming his initial shyness and awkward woodenness, he eventually consummates his love at her moment of greatest need for consolation (after which she summarily leaves the island for good). As I said earlier, the film implies much more than it shows and its two sex scenes &#150; the first raucous and funny (on the beach, between Grimes' equally starved best friend and a seemingly insatiable teenage acquaintance) and the second tender and emotional &#150; may seem much too tame for the jaded filmgoers of today but, for me, that does not detract from the amusement of the former and the power of the latter. Other humorous situations that have since became clichés (thanks to the surfeit of teenage sex comedies we have all suffered from in the interim) are the misplaced anatomical fondling at the cinema, the drooling over an illustrated biology textbook, the long-drawn out subterfuge required to order a pack of contraceptives from a suspicious pharmacist, the hero's own potentially raunchy but ultimately uneventful beach rendezvous at night, etc. The terrible trio of teenagers (including the proverbial bespectacled nerd with no gleam of interest in the opposite sex) were reunited two years later to continue their adventures in college, CLASS OF '44 (1973) &#150; a local TV screening of which I missed out on in the mid-1980s.

The way Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill) responds to the news of her husband's death doesn't resonate in any realistic way with this viewer. You can rationalize Dorothy's action to a need for compassion and solace if you want to, but to look to a fifteen year old boy for it just doesn't work for me. Had the film kept it's approach to a light hearted, 'American Graffiti' sort of sensibility it would have been a lot more believable. The movie theater scene and Oscy's (Jerry Houser) breathless exuberance in consummating his first sexual experience were well written and funny scenes, certain to bring back fond memories of one's own 'first time'. Even Hermie's (Gary Grimes) wistful encounters with Dorothy were realistic and dealt with youthful fantasy in a way that most viewers can relate to. Perhaps if the bedroom scene with Hermie and Dorothy had been handled as a dream sequence, their characters would have maintained a certain integrity that was diminished by what actually happened. As tastefully as it was done, I couldn't help thinking that the wrong message was being delivered here.

It was popular when it was released because of the memories of a time past were still fresh. In reality this one is aging for some very distinct reasons.It represents the apex of Jennifer O'Neill's career. It is without a doubt her best role. The rest of her career has been a futile pursuit of another role it's equal. So far that has never happened.This one represented every teenage boys dream when lots of baby boomer's were teens. Attractive woman in early 20's, desperate for attention, offers herself to a 15 year old boy. In this story they are 2 ships passing in the night as they only have one encounter. In the real world, this boy would be like the Energizer Bunny if he scored a beauty like this one. In fact, with this level of maturity, if he did tire of this woman, he would try and introduce his friends to her.The film has many moments of silence, drama, and the viewer is expected to think of these moments as yearning for another age of the past which no longer happens. Everyone back during the baby boom had these types of moments. Today, with all the distractions away from this kind of stuff, there would be little in common for most folks with what happens here.One thing this film did glorify is the older woman surrendering to the younger boys physical charms. This movie might have helped create the current generation of women school teachers who have victimized their young male students. As the memories of this film and of the greatest generation fades, I have a feeling the next generation of teachers will have more of an attraction for electronic devices than they will for young boys. The only interest they will have in young boys will be in finding ones who can master electronic devices at a younger age. The age of romance is over, and the summer of 42 and sequel class of 44 are long ago past.

Oscy chooses the pretty blonde Miriam and leaves Hermie with the mousy Aggie. Benjie runs off and Gloria also leaves.I think every guy has had an Oscy in his life during that age or maybe was the Oscy of the group himself. Oscy gives a nostalgic realism feel to this memory laden movie. Dorothy is a fantasy that is understandable by all men past the teenage years. The young guys fit their roles very well.

Nantucket was very appealing in this story, the coastal waters being very refreshing as well. As for the acting, Jennifer O'Neill portrayed so well the part of the lady with whom the young teenage boy became so taken. (Gary Grimes acted so well the part of the immature boy taken with her so strongly.) Jerry Houser was definitely an immature boy. But the storyline is not original. In their adolescent years, only a small number of boys do not find themselves fantasizing about some female they come upon and, as in this case, sometimes the women are too old for them; Grimes was a high school boy and O'Neill was somewhere in her middle 20's. In short, an adolescent boy meets an attractive older woman, he becomes strongly infatuated with her, and neither knows nor cares how the situation will resolve itself. The ending did and did not surprise me. To recapitulate, I was impressed with the nostalgia, the color and scenery were drawing, but the storyline was mediocre.

Perhaps because that same era was the time of my own adolescence, or perhaps because I saw far too many Happy Days episodes that, initially, I didn't see anything particularly novel about the story. By the end of the film, however, my impression had changed.At first, Hermy and Oscy seem to be nothing more than playful kids. Throughout the story, however, they repeatedly demonstrate surprising maturity that one normally expects from older, wiser men. I am referring to a sensitivity and conscientiousness beyond the feigned eloquence and other tactics they used to score with the babes. This distinction is key focal point of the story, and what separates the film from others that explore how young men cope with their growing sexual needs.The setting is all but perfect. The Japanese had just bombed Pearl Harbor and the country was in turmoil. Sheltered on a peaceful, lonely island, however, the boys were able to continue living out their youthful fantasies, far removed from the harsh realities that MEN had to face. It was as if, for them, time itself was suspended.****Spoiler****There has been a lot of talk about the movie's funny moments. My favorite was when Hermy and Dorothy were slow dancing, and the record stopped playing. Neither one made a move to start the record again. Instead, they continued dancing in awkward silence, as if they couldn't bear to break their tender embrace. They wanted that special moment to last forever, but it couldn't. Just as the record had to end, so did young Hermy's joyful and innocent youth and, ultimately, so does life itself.Facing these realities is what truly defined the moment when Hermy became a man, distinguishing himself from his best friend Oscy. From the beginning, Oscy was more knowledgeable and successful than Hermy in matters of sex, but by the story's end Oscy still could not look beyond yet another sexual conquest to see the painful heartbreak that comes with 'true' love.

The audience congratulates the writer and director for the film's message. Of course, the critical adulations are as many as the various reasons of why the film succeeded. Different groups applaud the film and few if any ever see the subtle lie woven intricately within the story. Such is the way with the film  Summer of 42'.  The movie itself is offered as a heartwarming story of a young, beautiful and lonely wife, waiting patiently for her soldier husband fighting the good fight in Europe during the summer of 1942. Woven into her lonely vigil is a young fifteen year old boy who's summer vacation is made a little more enticing by the fact, the woman in question finds favor in the hormone driven lad. Feminists see the woman as needing love and comfort and accepts the fact the youth conveniently fills that need. Teenage boys see nothing wrong with the union as nothing more than a physical act of opportunity. But for men of reality, this film is nothing more than blatant hypocrisy. When an older woman allows a young man to join her in bed, feminists, sigh and say how romantic. Yet, others view it as further proof of a double standard imposed on men who wish the same privilege without deterrent of law. If the roles of this film were reversed, an adult man, sleeping with a young teenage girl, those same feminists would be screaming, Child molester! Lolita lover! If the viewer proceeds further, those same women who love this film and easily accept the romantic affair and see nothing wrong with it, why then do they see the same romance between a man and a young girl, (when the wife is out of the way) as nothing short of rape? Could it be, one needs to be Gary Grimes before feminists concede the point? If not; this film, should be relegated to the graveyard of feminine hypocrisy, wherein lie other such films like Bridges of Madison County, and Birth. Touching as Robert Mulligans' 1971 film is and sympathetic as Jennifer O'Neill's character is, one either accept this film as romantic or nothing less than feminine child molestation. ** "},{"Title":"Captivating coming of age tale, but do note my disclaimer","Date":"6 March 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I saw this movie over 30 years ago when I was a young college student and loved it. However, my opinion of it has changed a bit over the years. I would still recommend this classic coming of age tale (both as an amusing glimpse into the hormones kicking in, so to speak, and also a young male adolescent's bittersweet experience of first love), but with a big disclaimer. Please don't anyone get their standards of appropriate adult behavior from it.In summary, this story, especially during the first half, revolves around the humorous, almost innocent sexual fantasies of three male adolescents (Hermie, Oscy, and Benjie) who get their thrills chortling over explicit reproductive pictures from medical journals and comparing notes about 'how far they got' (really, not very far!) with the young girls. Sadly, this would of course not make any story whatsoever today because sex is everywhere in the media and throughout society all the time. Later the main and quite endearing character, Hermie, is smitten with an 'older' 20 something year old woman, Dorothy (played by the lovely Jennifer O'Neill), whose husband is off fighting World War II. The early scenes between them as he helps her with groceries and so on are quite amusingly and touchingly done. Viewers of both sexes would be sympathetic toward Hermie's awkwardness, his youthful emotions and passions. Like one of the other reviewers, I found it pretty funny when 15 year old Hermie tries to impress the mature object of his affections with his fondness for black coffee! *** WARNING SPOILER AHEAD *** However, the finale to their relationship now gives me pause. One evening when Hermie visits Dorothy's beach house, he finds her quietly grief stricken, having just discovered that her husband has been killed in action oversees. He tries silently to comfort her, they begin slow dancing, one thing leads to another...and you can imagine the end result here. Hermie's conflicted emotions following his first sexual encounter are touching, as the two basically never see each other again.Now, 30 years after my original viewing and having raised a son myself, I find myself questioning Dorothy's behavior. I have every sympathy for the young widow's pain and am perhaps judging her a little harshly, but I'd be pretty upset, grief stricken or not, drinking or not, if a woman her age had slept with my son when he was 15. Hermie, raging hormones notwithstanding, isn't the one who took advantage of Dorothy's fragile emotional state to satisfy his own physical needs; SHE'S the one who took advantage of HIM and his youthful feelings to comfort HER. I was quite pleased to note that I'm not totally way out in left field here. Some reviewers seem positively livid and question whether Dorothy is a child molester or pedophile, and use phrases like statutory rape. I definitely wouldn't go that far, given her traumatized state, but make no mistake, it's not laudatory adult behavior. Using others (especially vulnerable adolescents) isn't right, so while it may be dramatic, let's not make this a rosy enchanting ending, please.If Hermie wasn't permanently scarred by the encounter, great. The point is, boys aren't just hormones but have emotions, too. A few have rightly commented that the public would be outraged if the sex of these two characters had been reversed, with a young girl being taken advantage of by a recently bereaved man in his 20's. They're absolutely correct that it wouldn't have been called a 'nostalgic' tale in that case. That being said and bear it in mind, it's an amusing and touching story all in all, and I suppose in a sense its sins are pretty minor (to say the least) when compared with the outrages on the screen today. You'll enjoy this movie and yes, you'll probably recall your own particular Summer of 42, whatever form it may have taken.

As I noted in my review of that movie, the scene where Katie first has sex with Hubbell challenges our attitude about rape and the double standard. In that case, it had to do with having sex with someone too drunk to have given consent. Summer of '42, on the other hand, challenges our attitude about rape and the double standard when it comes to having sex with someone too young to have given consent.With both movies, we pretty much have the same three time periods the 1940s, when the movies were set; the early 1970s, when the movies were made; and today, when we watch them from the perspective of the twenty-first century. In Summer of '42, a 15-year-old boy named Hermie falls in love with a 22-year-old woman named Dorothy. One evening, she gets word that her husband's plane has been shot down over France, and he is dead. She and Hermie have sex, and the next day she is gone.I never really cared for this movie, but that is neither here nor there. The sense of it was that Dorothy, in her grief, turns to Hermie for affection, and that what happens is a deeply meaningful and positive experience for him. Now, I don't know what the laws were in Massachusetts in 1942, but I am pretty sure that in most states, if a 22-year-old man had sex with a 15-year-old girl, he would be guilty of statutory rape, and if found out would be sent to prison, especially when the jury was told that he had sex with her on the very night he found out his wife had been killed, for that would make him seem callous. Should we condemn the man but excuse the woman? Did Dorothy deserve to go to prison for rape, just as a man would?Once again, as with The Way We Were, we have a situation in which there is consent after the fact, in this case, when the boy becomes a man. Does that matter? And if it does, what would our attitude toward Dorothy be if the adult Hermie was psychologically harmed? And once again we have to distinguish between the attitudes existing when the movie was set, when it was made, and the attitudes we have today.Even today, the double standard lends itself to late-night humor. Typical was when Jay Leno was discussing a story about a female teacher that had sex with one of her male students, leading Leno to ask in exasperation, Where were these teachers when I was in Junior High? Humor aside, could Summer of '42 be made today? More to the point, could such a story be told in a contemporary setting? Probably not. But I wonder if that represents a genuine change in attitude, or simply a fear that the movie would not be well received. I, for one, would have a hard time condemning Dorothy, even if the story were set in the present, just as I would have a hard time condemning Katie for what she did to Hubbell, even if the story were set in the present.

It would be the dream of any heterosexual youth to go to bed with Jennifer O'Neill's character, but it doesn't seem likely to happen.

The youngster offers to carry the attractive woman's groceries, and later lugs her boxes up into the attic, but what he really wants to do is master the twelve steps of coupling. Screenwriter Herman Raucher based his story on his own experiences as a sexually-curious juvenile, and received an Academy Award nomination for his work--rather surprising since the film (though popular at the box-office, for a variety of reasons) isn't very good. The dialogue throughout is so stilted and unremarkable, and the scenario so underpopulated and bland, that the sniggering charm of a vacuous boy hoping to ingratiate himself to an older woman is really all the picture has to offer. The Oscar-winning music by Michel Legrand gives the movie a touch of bittersweet nostalgia, but Robert Surtees' zoom-happy cinematography and Robert Mulligan's plodding direction just about kills any genuine interest in the characters. Newcomer Gary Grimes is over-directed; he's impossibly scrubbed-clean and galumphing one minute, and smiling like a naughty child the next. We first see Jennifer O'Neill romping with her husband in slow-motion, however the rest of her performance also feels a little slow. We never get to know this gorgeous lady; she's as overly-polite and blank as her junior-suitor. The finale is excruciatingly tasteful, dithering and dumb. There was no other place for the story to go but to the bedroom, but one can't help but thinking this was a bad idea. Audiences in 1971 surely hooted at the earnestness to which Grimes is initiated into manhood. Mulligan apparently wants us to feel a kinship with the boy, while the woman disappears into the sea-air like an evaporating question-mark. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Still holds up today","Date":"17 May 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The Motion Picture Association of America unfairly (in my opinion) slapped this movie with an R rating when it was first released. It's since been re-rated PG. Although there is swearing and sexual content (though no nudity), teenagers today have seen much more explicit content, and I think they would be able to relate to the events in the movie (if you could convince them to watch an older movie.) The movie captures well the often awkwardness that teenagers of any time in history go through, and how they are still children in some ways. (When the main characters are introduced, they are shown *crawling*.) And the movie wisely keeps its focus on its main characters - no parents are ever seen. The movie is not perfect - for one thing, one of the three main teenagers mysteriously disappears halfway through and is never seen again - but I think most teenagers and their parents will enjoy it. By the way, the Israeli sex comedy Lemon Popsicle series was clearly influenced by this movie - they even named one of their teens the same name as one of the teens in this movie! "},{"Title":"Casual, nostalgic coming of age story enhanced by music...","Date":"3 October 2006","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Michel Legrand won an Oscar for his sweetly nostalgic background score for SUMMER OF '42, a coming of age story about a teen-ager in love with a young war bride. JENNIFER O'NEILL is the rapturously attractive young woman and GARRY GRIMES the boy who fantasizes about her until they do meet and have a brief bittersweet affair.There's nothing special about the story except that it probably gave teen-age boys a fantasy they could easily relate to and in a way that would make a deep impression on them for the rest of their lives.It's skillfully directed by Robert Mulligan who gets a lot of humor and tenderness out of the tale, while at the same time capturing the manners and morals of the 1940s with the proper atmosphere, costumes and settings.A nice film that moves slowly but has some wonderful moments enhanced by Michel Legrand's easy to listen to kind of score. There's even some Max Steiner music from NOW VOYAGER mixed into the score.

Many directors (Nicholas Roeg, Terrence Malick, Bob Rafelson etc) were adopting a similar style during this time, but Mulligan enjoyed marrying his aesthetic to coming of age tales and cute flicks about lost innocence (The Man In The Moon, The Other, Summer of 42, Up the Down Staircase).Summer of 42 revolves around fifteen year old Gary Grimes, a fresh-faced kid who's spending the summer of 1942 vacationing on Nantucket Island, off the coast of New England. The Japanese have just bombed Pearl Harbour and America is in turmoil, but Gary and his friends, Jerry and Benjie, are far removed from the harsh realities of war. In fact, they only have one thing on their minds sex.Mulligan's camera watches as the boys discuss sex, go on dates with girls, purchase condoms and leaf through sex-education books, each scene tinged with a mixture of adolescent awkwardness and nostalgia. But it's local woman Dorothy who really gets the boys excited. Wife to a young man recently sent off to serve in World War 2, the boys watch from afar, with rapt fascination, as this beautiful woman glides angelically around their island.The rest of the film involves a fairly creepy sexual relationship between Dorothy and Gary, which eventually climaxes with the couple having sex. Why they copulate is given very little explanation, other than Gary being perpetually aroused, horny and anxious to enter manhood, and Dorothy being vulnerable because her husband has recently died abroad. The plot is so thin, the characters so cardboard and several scenes so lecherous (the camera focusing on Dorothy's butt, breasts, sunbathing body etc), that it's a surprise the film still works so well.Of course, swap the gender roles in this flick and audiences would be picketing cinemas and accusing it of promoting paedophilia (how many films are there where wounded grown men are seduced by 15 year old girls?), but Mulligan cons us into accepting this all as art, his poetic fades, gentle touch and relaxing camera work lending class to what is really one big male sex fantasy.Incidentally, a segment from this film is featured in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. The Shining, a film filled with reflections, number games (42, 21, 12s etc pop up all over the place in Kubrick's film) and mirrors, seems to reverse several scenes and gender roles in Mulligan's picture, and the oddly shaped mirror before which Dorothy and Gary make illicit love will itself appear in various forms in Kubrick's film, hinting at various dark, horrific avenues.7.9/10 &#x96; Despite its awkward acting and thin, salacious plot, Summer of 42 possess great atmosphere. A young Steven Spielberg would be heavily influenced by Mulligan, the predatory shark of Jaws modelled on Mulligan's The Stalking Moon and the lazy seaside atmosphere of Spielberg's coastal town building upon what Mulligan does here.

I must say I was underwhelmed. It wasn't a BAD movie, exactly. The photography and camera work are excellent and the sweeping shots of the sand dunes and beaches of its island setting were really nice. It solidly conveys a sense of nostalgia. And of course there's that terrific theme.But I felt held back by the acting, which was pretty marginal on all counts. Gary Grimes and the other two boys interact on the beach with a lot of top-volume screaming, which gets tiresome. You definitely get the sense throughout that everyone is delivering a line -- nothing sounds natural. Jennifer O'Neill is lovely but not much of an actress. And I thought the script was pretty thin -- I remember Herman Raucher's book being much richer.I don't mean to trash the movie entirely. It's worth renting, if only because it means so much to so many people. But it gets a solid C.

If you like that sort of thing have your head checked. I found it disturbing but does not surprise me from the era of the me generation.The other area that I find very disturbing was the path of the time-line. We were engulfed in a horrific period of time where bloodshed eclipsed anything we ever knew and this movie did one thing it trivialized it. Losing a husband with such a deep bond and thinking it okay to have a sexual relationship during mourning is sickening.This author is a pervert, is sick, and I for one find this movie nothing but offensive. I am sorry for those of you who liked it, you might want to think about your own mental health to tell you the truth because the theme here is one of a depraved mind. This is as far form a classic that I have ever seen and this is coming form someone with a very healthy view of life, fully Maslow engaged, and stability in every facet. I do not need to see a movie ingratiating sex. This is delusion, it is greed, it is deprivation and packaged in nice clothes, all the elements of wrong headed life. "},{"Title":"My brief review of the film","Date":"26 October 2005","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Often labeled as a drama, the material is too silly and lightly treated for it to make a good drama here, however it works okay as a comedy. Other than the final fifteen minutes or so, the nature of the material can only be accepted in the context of the comedy. Most of the events, such as the movie date and the drug store purchase, are predictable and drawn out, so they position the viewer to be amused, knowing what is going to happen, rather than sympathetic towards the characters. Even so, seeing the same old stuff does not make great viewing. The ontological ideas are so unoriginal that there is cause to wonder whether the scenes are funny for the wrong reasons. The dialogue is funny because it is so lame, and the violence is humorous because it looks unnatural&#133; it is an oddly amusing little coming-of-age comedy. The photography is superb, with panning and general camera movement providing a visual feel that reflects the bouncing nature of teenage excitement. It has a good, sentimental score too, and overall, it is better than average at least. The drama does not fit perfectly in, the comedy is a bit awkward, but the overall experience is amusing&#133; it is a fun way to spend 100 minutes of your time without having to concentrate too hard on what is happening.

Why not? Because the pedophile is a woman. The teacher in that movie repeatedly raped her student. That is a fact. But because of our inbuilt anti-male bias no one thought of that movie as portraying and gloriifying a criminal. But consider what the reaction would have been had a male teacher raped his female student in a similarly presented story?The character of Dorothy played by Jennifer O'Neill has sex with a minor boy. Why a statutory rape is regarded as 'sensitive' and 'beautiful' I cannot fathom. If 'Dorothy' had been a man whose wife was killed and HE raped a minor girl I doubt if the film would have been seen as touching.

While the film had some truly funny situations and some good lines, I still find it difficult to overlook the fact that a woman, most likely in her early twenties, had sex with a 15 year-old boy who looked even younger than 15. I don't care if it was nostalgic. No matter what way you frame it, it still constitutes statutory rape.If you still don't see it that way, then look at the movie this way what if the situation was reversed? By that, I mean if the movie centered on a young, 15 year-old girl who had a crush on a good-looking man in his early twenties. If that man had sex with the little girl, there wouldn't be anyone calling this film sweet and poingant. No, my friends, we'd be calling it pedophilia; we'd be saying that he took advantage of her.
