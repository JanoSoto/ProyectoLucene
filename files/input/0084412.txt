Keaton's hilarious performance only serves to underscore the fact that he's never been near as funny since.Sure, the movie will never be in the AFI's top 100 list. But when I was 18, a loony pre-college me dreamed of being as funny as Billy Blaizejowski, Keaton's character in the film. I credit the script for great lines, but I doubt anyone could have made an annoying character like Billy loveable - except Keaton.Henry Winkler does a bang-up job with a straight role that affords audiences little to get excited about. He is completely convincing as an in-over-his-head nebbish with a nervous stomach, and deserves credit for pulling it off without seeming whiny. We identify with Winkler's character even though we can see how cowardly he is.The plot, of course, is contrived, as is any plot involving hookers with hearts of gold. It's hard to see Shelly Long as a prostitute, but she plays it gamely and has fun with the role.I recommend this film if you have any craziness to your sense of humor, or just if you're a male between the ages of 17 and 25. That's the target audience, but even in my mid-30's, I still find Keaton's performance refreshing and laugh-out-loud funny.

Many have commented on Keaton's top-notch breakout performance -- and it truly is one of the funniest supporting performances since Matthau's Whiplash Willie Gingrich.  But, there are many other wonderful tidbits to enjoy thoroughly -- beginning with an incredibly clever script by Ganz and Mandell -- so many classic lines I almost don't know where to begin.  Gina Hecht is also magnificently memorable in her supporting role as Winkler's neurotic girlfriend, and Nita Talbot is a gem as the domineering mother.  Winkler is perfect as the understated nebbish lead, and the contrast of the low-income realities and the humor found in the script is marvelously unusual in American movies beyond Little Shop of Horrors. In fact, the movie deftly blends reality and absurdity in a manner few have succeeded at.  Finally, the ahead-of-its-time cast includes Shannen Doherty as a junior girl scout, Richard Belzer as a grotesque gangster pimp, Kevin Costner as a frat boy, Clint Howard (Ron's younger brother who starred in Gentle Ben and a classic Star Trek episode) as Keaton's first limo customer, Murphy Brown's Pat Corley as Hecht's father, and Ghost's Vincent Schiavelli as an obnoxious deliveryman.  And, I do disagree with mainstream thought that Shelley Long was miscast -- she actually imbues her character with some underappreciated mannerisms that ring very true for me that transcend the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche.  All in all, a funny and harrowing film much better than it is generally given credit for.

The plot is quite simple as Michael Keaton (Billy Blazejowski) and Henry Winkler (Chuck Lumley) work on the night shift at a morgue. Billy is an idea man,(he wants to feed mayonaisse to tuna to simplify the process of having to mix the mayo with the tuna) while Chuck is seems less and less content spending time when he can alone with his neurotic girlfriend. One day as he arrived at his apartment building, Chuck bumps into his neighbor, Shelly Long, after she had been beaten up by her pimp. Chuck later shares her plight with Billy Blaze. Well, it's at that point that Billy suggests that he and Chuck should run an escort service out of the morgue at night as pimps for Chuck's neighbor. The hilarity begins well before that, as there are too many quotes to list. I will say that once they become LOVEBROKERS, as Billy so entusiastically suggested, their lifestyles change as the main characters' Parsons allow. This is a great movie that I now proudly own.

He and Henry Winkler as a pair of mismatched oddballs make the perfect comic duo in this Ron Howard comedy.Henry Winkler is the soft spoken, timid Chuck Lumley. He's a moper, and works at the city morgue, which is where he meets the wild Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton), an absolute fun-loving weirdo with a headful of crazy get-rich-quick ideas. Bill wants Chuck to be his partner for his next business venture they're going to run a high class prostitution ring out of the city morgue. The idea sounds stupid, but it is well-meaning in some regards, since these are career prostitutes who've gotten pushed around for too long. Bill and Chuck are going to be their friendly godpimps, and help them be successful, high class hookers. Their clientelle are kind, jolly fellows, and the pimps (Chuck and Bill) are always good to the girls. And they all make a sh*tload of cash. Unfortunately, in trying to create this romantic comedy aspect (Chuck falls in love with Belinda--Shelly Long--who is one of the hookers), it glamorizes prostitution, which is pretty sad and at the same time, pretty stupid.Also, while Chuck and Bill are having their fun, a pimp and his goon (Richard Belzer and Badja Djola)want to know where all of their girls have gone and why, if someone else is running the business, they haven't been given a cut of the profits. They're a dangerous pair (although, they turn out to be pretty wimpy in the end). The movie becomes a combination of the Odd Couple as Bill tries to invovle Chuck in all sorts of his crazy ideas once the prostitution gimmick picks up and becomes quite successful. Chuck, it being part of his nature to always do things safely and not too spontaneously, gradually becomes annoyed with Bill, especially when Bill's ideas start to get him in a whole lot of trouble. Though, in Bill's defense, he does try to help his friend out by trying to get him to stand up for himself and quit being afraid of everything. Henry Winkler and Michael Keaton are terrific here in all of their zany antics. The other half of the movie is something like Irma La Douce in that Belinda is the lovely prostitute that Chuck has fallen for. And, once he does, he doesn't want her hooking anymore. Shelly Long was also quite good in this movie, and a natural, as always. What an underrated actress.Night Shift is a pretty good comedy with a great cast that makes a somewhat stupid story work great. The dialogue is just absolutely silly (like when Bill and Chuck are fighting in the office and all Bill can say is as he's crashing through glass and junk is that Bill should be careful because Chuck's wearing white).

Leave it to screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who put a rollicking script in the hands of director Ron Howard, who ran with it and ended up scoring a minor comedy classic with `Night Shift.'  Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler) is in something of a funk; he's been relegated to the night shift at the morgue where he's worked for years, thanks to the nepotism of his boss, who has installed a nephew into Chuck's day shift.  Now Chuck has to train the new man, one Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) a real `idea man' who can't sit still and never seems to quit talking, much to the chagrin of the conservative Chuck, who likes to keep things quiet and simple.  When Chuck befriends Belinda (Shelley Long), a neighbor in his apartment who just happens to be a prostitute, Bill gets wind of it and has an idea.  Belinda and her friends are in a dangerous business, and they could use some help and protection.  Nights at the morgue are slow, and they have a limo at their disposal (Sure, it's a hearse, but slap a sign on the door, and you're in business).  Bill convinces Chuck that they could make a fortune as `love brokers,' working right out of the morgue.  And soon Chuck's life will never be the same. 	Keaton is absolutely spectacular as Bill (`Call me &#145;Billy Blaze'), in whom he has created a totally off-the-wall, quirky, uniquely nuanced and endearing character you're never going to forget.  He pulls out all the stops and never quits, playing perfectly off of Winkler's reserved and cautious-to-a-fault Chuck, the perfect foil for Bill.  The timing between these two is right on the mark, and Howard keeps the pace steady and the laughs coming.  Wisely, the story avoids any moralizing or delving into the murky waters of the subject matter; after all, this is a comedy, not `Taxi Driver,' and Howard never lets it slip even close to leaving the laugh track.  He keeps it light and funny and makes sure the characters are real people; there's no buffoonery or slapstick here, and it keeps the real humor centered and at the heart of the story.  Shelley Long, too, adds a nice touch with her spin on Belinda, the hooker with the heart-of-gold. 	The supporting cast includes Gina Hecht (Charlotte), Pat Corley (Edward), Bobby Di Cicco (Leonard), Nita Talbot (Vivian), Clint Howard (Jefferey) and Joe Spinell (Manetti); and look closely for Kevin Costner as a frat boy in the party scene at the morgue.  Howard gets high marks for making `Night Shift' a memorable comedy, and for keeping the dynamic Keaton on track to deliver one of the most singular performances of his career.  This is a movie with heart, and most importantly, plenty of laughs.  You'll be glad you didn't let this one pass you by.  I rate this one 8/10.

Whereas Chuck is quiet and considerate, Bill is totally loud, spontaneous and unpredictable. The second person to suddenly appear in Chuck's life is a prostitute named Belinda Keaton (Shelley Long) who has just lost her pimp and needs someone to help her out. While Chuck is sympathetic to her plight, Bill sees an opportunity and soon all three of them become part of something that none of them can control. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an exceptional comedy which benefits from the great chemistry displayed by the three afore-mentioned actors.

But the two eventually come to terms with each other, especially when Chuck informs Billy that's his prostitute neighbour Belinda is on the lookout for a pimp. Billy gets an idea, which would see them pimping and using the mortuary at night as their place of business.Ron Howard's second stab at directing brings us a crazy, maniac and no-stop comedy set in New York, involving pimping, hookers and a morgue. It might sound dreary and lowbrow and it could've turned out to be, but this hearty 80s product mostly steers clear away from that edge. However New York still comes across as one sordid location within that time period. What I loved form this exercise had to be the two wholesome lead performances and their interactions. Michael Keaton's highly enjoyable fresh-faced debut is excellent, as the neurotic motor mouth, Billy Idea-man Blazejowski and Henry Winkler is superbly deadpan as the timid, drab pushover Chuck Lumley. The two bounce off each other rather fittingly and stew up likable turns. Shelly Long is wonderfully teasing as the call girl Belinda. Gina Hecht beautifully overplays the part as Chuck's fiancée Charlotte. Bursting in with fun support roles and cameos range from Jim Staahl, Clint Howard, Richard Belzer, Basil Hoffman, Joe Spinell, Nita Talbot, Monique Gabrielle and a very young Shannen Doherty. The cast cooks up interest on hand. Writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (who would team up with Howard a couple more times) kick up an unconventionally witty, twitchy and warm-hearted character comedy, which was rich on the snappy and memorable dialogues, few surprising actions and oddball situations that skittle out of control, but it did start seem to drag and feel overlong towards the latter end. While being sentimental in patches, gladly it never reached any overbearing levels and the use of the running gags to show how much of a push-over Winkler's character is, didn't get too tiring. Howard's second shot at directing is patchy, but ably executed for such an itchy tempo and he uses the grungy locations well to capture the right feel with sturdy photography. Burt Bacharach's music score has that light jazzy flavour, with an upbeat, smoking soundtrack to boot.Night Shift might get swept under the mat and be terribly dated in its context, but for nostalgia purposes and Keaton's off-the-rocker performance, makes this an appealing comedy.

Well, he is great but few people are giving deserved props to Winkler's performance. Sure, he is a little boring and plain but that's the nature of his character. I related more to him than Keaton, whose wild antics and personality are fun and not too over-the-top. A nice balance is struck between his craziness as Bill and Winkler's calm, yet clumsy and likable Chuck. Appropriately enough, I am finding Night Shift an excellent viewing for the night time, particularly as I am settling into bed. Not that it bores me to sleep, far from it...but it's more fun to watch in the evening because of it's setting and premise, NY morgue employees-turned-pimps who do it all at night.

Michael Keaton just bounces off the walls as Billy Blaze, it is still to this day ,one of his most memorable turns. Henry Winkler obviously wanted to play against his persona as the Fonz, and manages inject great pathos into his character , without ever being overly sentimental. Shelley Long is a master of light comedy , she may not instantly be an actress one would consider to play a lady of the night, but realism would have worked against this film ,as it really is a flight of fantasy.Its a true feelgood comedy, well written, well acted and very likable, in other words ,far superior to cynical, race to out-gross , slew of humorous films we are subjected to now.

Winkler plays discontented employee Chuck Lumley, whose life seems to be going nowhere. But when opportunistic Billy Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) takes a job in the morgue, things change for the crazier.It's especially neat that this movie turned Michael Keaton into a star (Howard would go on to direct him in Gung Ho and The Paper). The first time that I'd seen this movie's title and didn't know anything about the movie, I assumed that it was a horror movie. But it's not; it's a super-hilarious comedy. Michael Keaton has some truly wacky lines (namely his comment about the photograph, his license plate, and his question in police detention). Also starring are Shelley Long as Chuck's hubby Belinda Keaton, Richard Belzer (Henry Winkler's cousin) as one of the bad guys, Ron Howard's brother Clint as a client, and Kevin Costner in his film debut. There is also character actor Vincent Schiavelli, who died yesterday. I'm sure that he's now up in that great cinema in the sky, taking pride in his filmography - including Night Shift. 10/10.

Winkler is excellent in the role of Chuck, a character completely opposite from his tough and confident Fonzie TV persona. Chuck is a laid back nebbish of a man, engaged to a domineering girlfriend, who finds comfort mainly at his quiet job as a morgue attendant in New York City. He's got a pretty neighbor named Belinda (Shelley Long) who's a nice girl but also happens to be a prostitute. One day a loud and obnoxious new work partner who calls himself Billy Blaze (Michael Keaton) invades Chuck's perfect world, and Chuck's life is never the same. He allows the persuasive Blaze to talk him into turning the unoccupied nighttime morgue into a side business for Belinda and her call girl friends, thus turning Chuck and Bill into pimps (or Loverbrokers, as Blaze prefers to call themselves). NIGHT SHIFT is the perfect early '80s comedy and one of the best of the decade. It's smartly written with many quotable lines, and one should not be immediately put off by the grimy nature of its subject, because it's so much more than just some cheap or sleazy frat movie; it's also a buddy film and touching love story as well, set along the invigorating backdrop of Manhattan. Ron Howard's direction is flawless, and he's got a great cast to work with, beginning with Winkler (who was nominated for a Golden Globe), who makes his nice guy dweeb character completely believable and sympathetic. Then there is Michael Keaton, who is outrageously funny in his motion picture debut, and who steals the show. Shelley Long (of CHEERS fame) manages to instill a sweet girl next door quality to her prostitute character. This is a feel-good comedy that leaves you feeling great at the end, to the tune of Burt Bacharach's That's What Friends Are For (sung by Rod Stewart). **** out of **** "},{"Title":"Is this a great country or what?","Date":"23 December 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In my humble opinion, Ron Howard should have tried directing R rated comedies more often during his career as he shows here to have a real knack for it. Written by frequent collaborators Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, and marking an early joint effort for him and producer Brian Grazer, Night Shift is not only an agreeably saucy film, but the writers and director are also able to mine this material for a lot of heart, and the actors create likable, memorable characters. Howards' 'Happy Days' co-star Henry Winkler shines in a part far removed from that of the ultra-cool Fonz. He's Chuck Lumley, a timid, nerdy type who got stressed out working as an investment counselor and sought the peace and quiet of working in the city morgue. This doesn't last long when he's forced to work the night shift and partnered with wild man Bill Blaze Blazejowski (Michael Keaton, in one hell of a film debut), a talkative idea man. Among his ideas are edible paper, therefore cutting down on garbage, and feeding mayonnaise to tunafish. Anyway, things take a bizarre turn for Chuck after he's made friends with Belinda (Shelley Long), a sweet hooker who's moved into his building. Her pimp has been knocked off and now her johns are taking advantage of her. So after some thought he agrees to Bills' idea that they should become the pimps for Belinda and all of her gal pals. This is great fun all the way through, with Keaton completely stealing the show as Blaze, and getting most of the good lines. Long admittedly makes for a rather unlikely hooker, but she still has a lot of appeal here and does look very nice cooking eggs in her underwear. The film does go on for quite a bit but is entertaining enough that you don't feel that much time going by. An impressive amount of familiar faces fill out supporting and bit parts Gina Hecht, Pat Corley, Bobby Di Cicco, Nita Talbot, Howards' brother Clint, Joe Spinell, Richard Belzer, Grand L. Bush, Charles Fleischer, Vincent Schiavelli, Michael Pataki, Howard himself in dual cameo roles, Shannen Doherty, and Kevin Costner (you have to be quick to spot him) as a frat boy. Good score (by Burt Bacharach) and songs (by Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager); the songs include That's What Friends Are For, sung by Rod Stewart, years before it was a hit for Dionne Warwick & Friends.Here's just a couple of lines to pique your interestThis is Chuck to remind Bill to SHUT UP! Call Star-Kist. Oh, that Barney Rubble...what an actor! LOOOVE brokers!All in all, it's an 80s comedy worth seeking out or rediscovering.Eight out of 10.

To be honest, I am rather ambivalent towards Howard's supposed talent as a film-maker well-suited to light-hearted, life-affirming fare such as this, SPLASH (1984) and COCOON (1985), he has regrettably failed to convince when tackling more serious subjects. Anyway, this was certainly an auspicious beginning an original, if not exactly credible, premise wherein two morgue attendants (mild-mannered Henry Winkler &#x96; Howard's ex-buddy from his HAPPY DAYS TV series &#x96; and charismatic Keaton) decide to turn their literally inert shift into a booming call-girl business! Keaton's uncontained exuberance here may have lead to his getting the title role in BEETLEJUICE (1988) but nonetheless comes across as essentially overstated; Winkler though, miles away from his iconic and ultra-confident Fonzie character, is wonderful and he is matched by Shelley Long (of CHEERS fame, hence another established TV performer trying to break into movies) as the call-girl abused by customers (after her pimp is flamboyantly 'executed') who seeks comfort in the arms of neighbor Winkler (himself engaged to a neurotic woman dominated by strict parents). For all the seediness on display (involving partying in morgues, courtroom exhibitionism and exclusive sex clubs), the film proves a generally agreeable and entertaining ride &#x96; faltering only on occasion due to overlength (106 minutes). Consequently, there are plentiful felicities throughout (not least an early rendition of the Burt Bacharach/Rod Stewart song That's What Friends Are For) in the way of situations (notably a running-gag involving Winkler being chased by a hound let loose in the corridors of his apartment building) and dialogue (particularly when, ending up in prison and being accosted by a murder-happy cellmate, Winkler sarcastically thanks Keaton for having made possible his acquaintance with Peter Lorre's son!). Joe Spinell has a small role towards the end as the slimy manager of the swank brothel to which Long relocates after her association with Winkler and Keaton is disrupted the latter happens to work at the same joint as a towel-boy(!), while the former follows her there on summing up the courage to finally express his love.

As one of Ron Howard's earliest efforts it highlights his two greatest traits; his willingness to employ friends and family (eg. Henry Winkler and his brother Clint) and his ability to make a commercial film. His mentor Roger Corman bragged about never having lost a dime on a movie and I have little doubt that Ron Howard can echo that claim. My only real complaint comes near the end of the film, when during an orgiastic party in the morgue a woman exposes her breasts. Given the tawdry nature of the film the shot shouldn't be so jarring but it is the only nudity in the entire film. Howard had made an entire film essentially about prostitution without any nudity up to that point, so there was no reason to descend into nudity in that shot. It is the definitition of gratuitous. If nudity bothers you don't see this film, but if you want to see a film about prostitution, I can't believe that a little nudity would make a difference. It's unnecessary and Howard's taste improved as time went on. "},{"Title":"Keaton's funniest movie?

Whereas Night Shift is a parody and shows some pretense towards the normal but abnormalities of living in a big city, yet does so with pure improvised humor, the type that leaves you rolling on the floor laughing literally so, by the movies end. Perhaps Ron Howard's best Comedy he ever directed as well. If you need a guaranteed night of hard laughter, definitely rent or buy this movie. It can still occasionally to rarely be found in VHS sale racks, and was remastered for DVD. Definitely one of my favorite comedies. This movie and Keaton's role as the bumbling fumbling crazy but serious idiot makes this movie what it is, while Henry Winkler and Shelly Long attempt to balance this hilarious riot comedy with some serious sides of what is a attempt of living a normal life, but infiltrated with Keaton's wit, (which is as sharp and funny spontaneously as any Robin Williams stand up comedy has ever been). Keaton at his best, while his character is intensely amped up and nuts but serious. Keaton's character, Billy Blazejowski is the new hire in the Night Shift at the local morgue, a apprentice to the withdrawn surrendered Winkler. Blazejowski always carries around a mini tape recorder to capture his moments of brilliance, as he often comes up with inventions one after another. For example, at one point on his way out the door, he stops due to a brilliant plan for a invention and speaks into his voice recorder. New invention, feed Tuna mayonnaise, that way you already have Tuna Salad, boy would that save a lot of work! Kevin Costner's little role in this movie is not even worth mentioning, as he perhaps is on screen for 1 or 2 minutes, and this role could of been played by anyone. Costner's role was not cast with anyone special in mind. However, perhaps only Robin Williams is the only other actor who could of fulfilled Keaton's role, with the genius spontaneity of comedy. This movie was during a period in Keaton's life when he was only known for his comedy, and he definitely peaked with it here. However being the great actor he is, and like so few are unable to (exception being Robin Williams, again), was gifted enough to break away from the stereotypical nut ball comedian, by performing in serious roles with brilliance, later on in his career. This is a real sign of a great actor, who can float between a wide diverse number of different roles, from comedy, to serious drama, to Super Hero, and wicked criminal, to any serious drama and horror characters. Without doubt a 10 rating, and a genius by the Director Ron Howard, and lead actors, mainly Keaton.

Thanks to a hysterical debut performance by a young Michael Keaton and a likable (albeit unimpressive) Henry Winkler, Night Shift is an amiable enough comedy that provides a good dose of entertainment and humor in all the right places.It stars Winkler as a shy morgue attendant who is grudgingly put on night shift duty -- only to find out that his new partner Bill (Keaton) is a loudmouthed, obnoxious, fast-talking city kid with no desire to work at all. During the long nights, Bill rents out the morgue's limo as a transportation service. (These guys paid me four hundred dollars to drive them from the airport to the UN!) Bill is oblivious to failure and knows no humiliation. He carries around a tape recorder so that he can capture his brilliant ideas the moment they enter his brain. One of his more unique imaginings is the concept of feeding mayonnaise to tuna ahead of time, so that people don't have to mix their own tuna fish salads.Winkler is given top billing and the film primarily focuses on his character's plight, however it is Keaton who lights up the screen and really makes Night Shift such an infectious experience. During the moments when he is off-screen, Night Shift feels bogged down and unrealistic &#150; with an unnecessary subplot involving a prostitute (Shelley Long) and her romantic ventures with Winkler.This does, however, open up a plot opportunity for the film When her pimp is killed, Winkler and Keaton decide to become local managers, operating out of the morgue and taking a mere ten percent of profits versus the standard eighty. It's a sort of darker version of Risky Business &#150; and somehow the movie seemed a lot funnier, and also seemed to work a whole lot better, before it settled down into a plot. Admittedly the brothel aspect of the film leaves itself open to a few clever satirical moments (such as the business side of prostitution and Keaton's charismatic chalkboard speech to the girls which plays like a coach lecturing a football team) but overall it runs out of steam long before it should.So, no, Ron Howard's directorial debut is hardly the pinnacle of comedy. This was Howard's first true attempt at making a movie, and it shows &#150; the direction is awkward and not very distinct. It could be mistaken for any other Police Academy-era slapstick comedy on first inspection. And the movie &#150; written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel &#150; does seem to head towards National Lampoon/SNL-type humor a few times; most commonly when the film starts focusing on Winkler and his home life.But as mentioned above, the comedy works best when it's focusing on the relationship between Keaton and Winkler and not on the other stuff that it's actually supposed to about. Had some of the unnecessary filler been cut, the mandatory romance shortened, the unrealistic moments altogether scrapped and the scenes inside the morgue lengthened, Night Shift would be a really great comedy.As it is, the movie works well as a crowd-pleaser &#150; if you're not expecting anything great you'll be pleasantly surprised, and likely walk away with a higher opinion of the film than you ever imagined you would. It's got a handful of really funny jokes and keeps the viewer's interest, which is really all that should be expected from such a motion picture in the first place.

He impresses and amuses in his eccentric over-the-top role. He plays his role with lots of class and professionalism and thanks to that he never becomes ridiculous in his role but funny and consistent instead. But please, let's also not forget Henry Winkler. I mean this is the Fonz we're talking about and he made this movie even in the middle of his Happy Days period but yet he is great and totally believable in his role in this movie as a loser who in many ways is the opposite of his character Fonzie. This movie shows that Henry Winkler really is a great and perhaps also underrated actor who can play a diversity of roles. Some smaller roles in this movie are for well known actors such as Clint Howard, Shelley Long, Richard Belzer, Vincent Schiavelli and bit parts for Ron Howard himself and Kevin Costner and Shannen Doherty in their first small movie roles (blink your eyes once and you'll miss them).But despite all the talent involved this movie is not really a successful one. Probably thing to blame for this is the story, which is nothing special and not always very consistent. The movie lacks a really remarkable or memorable comical plot line. There are some funny moments throughout the movie but not enough to entirely regard this movie successful as a comedy.

Winkler is so totally laid back and the plot continually turns macabre against him. Keaton is so over the top you're likely to feel like Winkler by the end of the movie (which might be the idea). Keaton's supposed to be the one who's so good here, but his character is just downright stupid - an ass. Which isn't really funny at all. Nope - Shelley saves the day. Keaton you can kick and leave in a back alley and things will be really fine - he's not even close to being critical to the plot line - but dump Shelley back there and Ron Howard's venture dies.Look for a very noodle-like Mr Noodle here - in other words Kevin Costner. The party scene. He's the one marching behind Keaton. Shannen Doherty is supposedly in here too but I haven't seen her and mostly likely won't hurry back to look again. (They say she's in the lift; I still won't go back, as in 'go back for what'.) For that matter there are a lot of familiar faces in here. You might not know their names, but you'll go 'oh yeah so-and-so'.Some familiar music, some of which you may like; some nice moments - the first breakfast scene is nice; some sentimentality; but don't look for a story that makes too much sense and has you feeling totally good inside by the end, for you won't be like that - you'll feel somewhat empty but of course not fully empty. It's the screenplay - hopping skipping jumping - contrived.But totally bad it's not, although were it not for Shelley it might be. It just isn't a total turn-on.

I've never been a Michael Keaton fan, and I don't see any reason why the over-the-top silliness of this, his movie debut, should make me one. He portrays a goofy character in an unconvincing way. The plot is trite, the scenes are predictable, the stereotypical Hollywood ending is obvious midway through the movie. The electric piano that plays intermittently throughout the movie is annoying. For some reason, the song Jumpin Jack Flash keeps coming up throughout the movie. Shelley Long is OK as the obviously scripted to fall in love with the male lead prostitute just prior to her role on Cheers. Winkler is miscast by his Happy Days buddy Ron Howard as Keaton's straight guy/foil, the conservative man, who of course, even though he is engaged to be married, falls in love with the prostitute, who of course, just happens to live in the apartment next door. There's even the obligatory get-thrown-in-jail-scene.You've got it.....paint by numbers material.This is strictly Hollywood formula product. If you're going to watch this movie, you might as well kill a few brain cells in preparation, cause it doesn't require many to sit through this. This movie has no more artistic substance than dog food, dishwasher detergent, or toilet paper, it's just generic schlock material designed for mass consumption. Unless you're a die-hard fan of this 80s genre, you won't be missing much if you miss this one.

I grew up watching Henry Winkler as the Fonz and he's had success as a serious actor and as a producer. Ron Howard went on from this very early film to grow as a director into one of the finest in his craft. Keaton has rarely made a bad film and is consistently good to watch in both dramatic and comedic moments.Having said all this, I have to forgive them all for having made this film. In the day it was made I suppose this type of humor was acceptable and tickled not a few funny bones. Frankly, it has not aged well and having now watched it for the first time in 2007 it made me roll my eyes in disbelief. The script is silly beyond reckoning and totally not believable. I mean, when we watch Ghostbusters for example, we know that the script is a cartoon and no one stops to consider if it could have happened. When we watch Blues Brothers or Animal House we know that although very exaggerated, they are believable in their own crazy ways. When we watch Night Shift then no, it is not believable for these types of lunacies to carry on in the night shift of a city morgue. I know it's a farce but the humor was lost on me. Winkler's character was the most limp-wrist pansy I've seen in years. One get's the impression that a strong gust of wind would blow him over. Keaton, in his debut steals all his scenes and is funny to watch, given the script. There were all kinds of films from that era (I just watched Nine to Five) that at the time we thought quite funny. Now they just make me squirm or wonder why they were made? Great humor is universal and passes it's message on from generation to generation. Think of Chaplin and Keaton and you'll see my point. This film, while early in their careers is just too weak, silly and in our internet-violent world just ridiculous.

For the millionth time, we also have the lovable, sentimental women playing hookers (give me a break!) who are helped out in a time of distress by another lovable goof-ball (Michael Keaton) who, of course, has no morals, either. That's why he's portrayed as someone to root for, as is our old pal Fonzi from Happy Days. Yes, Henry Winkler is here playing another creep whom Howard makes look appealing even though he abandons his nice fiancé for a hooker (Shelly Long). Nowhere in all of this does it indicate Winkler or anyone else is doing the wrong thing.There were some humorous moments in here, but not a third as many as the hype for this film would have you believe. Overall, just a worthless piece of trash.

In one scene the doctor pulls a wooden stake out of a patient's abdomen at the scene of a wreck, a procedure likely to rip apart major arteries and result in almost instantaneous death. Second,cutting a car support post with a power saw, rather than using a jaws-of-life attachment. No rescue team with training and equipment would resort to using the saw in those circumstances. Thousands of sparks at an auto accident are an open invitation to a gasoline explosion, not to mention injuring rescue workers with flying hot metal bits. Third, the improvised short back-board has been available for decades. In addition, the expert holding the youngster with the spinal injury would have been unable to control the head without under-chin support.All of these points are common knowledge with EMTs, Paramedics and Rescue Squads. While your stuff may make for good viewing by the uninitiated, to those of us who've done the work, the cast looks like a bunch of bumbling idiots. Is this supposed to be drama or the Keystone Cops meet Squad 51 from the old Emergency! show?? I give the show three episodes before it's canceled. Really BAD.

The other ladies of the evening are unconvincing and the last 30 minutes of the film drag as if no ending was written and the director realized he had more film than dialog left.It's funny the first time around if you stop 3/4 of the way through.

Story concerns morgue workers who become pimps while working the night shift. Allegedly based on a true incident, this must be the ugliest movie ever set in New York City, with a sitcom-driven plot and bad jokes followed by pauses for a non-existent laugh-track. Performances by Henry Winkler and Shelley Long are good and elevate this above trash-level, but Michael Keaton is wearing (and his over-the-top hamming certainly can't save the grueling final ten minutes, which is more excruciating than the entire length of Splash). Is this a great country or what?...not when movie-lovers praise a comedy with no comic-timing and the kind of fantasy-prostitutes who can't wait to jump into the sack. *1/2 from **** "}]
