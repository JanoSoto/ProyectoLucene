[{"Title":"Ullman Matches Allen","Date":"9 March 2006","Score":"30 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" I doubt if many people share this sentiment, but this is my favorite Woody Allen movie simply because it does what Allen usually sets out to do makes me laugh. I'm not a big fan of Allen's films but he and Tracey Ullman make a great pair in this 95-minute farce. Ullman has to be one of the most talented ladies to never achieve real movie stardom. She matches Allen laugh-for-laugh in here and, in some respects, even steals the show.Other than Allen's penchant for using the Lord's name in vain, this has a real classic-film feel to it, one of those old bickering spouse films but with more modern-day humor. Allen and Ullman trade some very funny insults, and there are many of these quality gags. Ullman is just plain hilarious as the bimbo-like Frenchy.Add a gigolo (Hugh Grant), a couple of inept crooks, a couple of old-time Elaine favorites, Strich and May, and a pretty funny premise and you have some good entertainment and an underrated Allen film.

In this film, Allen more or less abandons his customary obsession with big city neuroses and middle-aged angst in favor of a more straightforward, plot-driven comedy, paying homage in its patchwork and eclectic story to any number of earlier well-known theatrical and cinematic works. For example, the first half hour of the movie plays like a stateside version of the 1950's Italian comedy `Big Deal on Madonna Street' as a team of bumbling, far-from-intelligent small time crooks, led by ex-con Ray Winkler (Allen), sets up a cookie store as a `front' so they can drill a tunnel into a bank a mere two or three shops down the road.  Then the plot of the film suddenly shifts gears when that plan falls apart and the gang hits pay dirt with the surprising success of the cookies that Ray's uncultured but well meaning wife, the former topless dancer Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), is assiduously baking and selling.  The highlight of the film comes in the form of a brilliantly satiric pseudo-60 Minutes report in which Steve Kroft himself chronicles the meteoric rise that this ragtag collection of accidental entrepreneurs takes from obscure small business owners to multi-million dollar corporate giants &#150; a report that pokes affectionate fun at the clich√©d rags-to-riches theme so essential to our concept of the beloved American Dream.   With this plot switch, we leave Madonna Street and head into `Unsinkable Molly Brown/Pygmalion/Educating Rita' territory as the vulgar, uncouth Frenchy realizes that, even with all her suddenly acquired wealth, she cannot possibly gain true acceptance from the elite cultural snobs she so desperately wants to impress without a little assistance from her own personal Henry Higgins, who arrives in the form of an art dealer named David played by the suave Hugh Grant.   Thus, as Frenchy branches out and begins to open herself up to new cultural experiences, the couple begins to drift apart as Ray comes to crave the return to the simpler life of spaghetti and meatball dinners he knows they have left far behind.Had Allen been able to sustain the cleverness and bite that inform that `60 Minutes' segment throughout the length of the entire film, `Small Time Crooks' might have emerged as more than just the mere piece of entertaining puffery it ultimately is.  Indeed, we find ourselves laughing only occasionally and often at jokes or sight gags that would barely register a chuckle in one of Allen's more sophisticated, more edgy and more character-driven works.  Special note must, however, be made of some of the actors, prime among them Ullman and the always brilliant Elaine May who, as Frenchy's adenoidal, utterly befuddled and endearingly obtuse cousin, returns to her `A New Leaf' roots and provides some of the sweetest comic moments in the film.  Unfortunately, Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz, as members of Ray's gang, though they all three give outstanding performances, aren't given enough screen time to really let their talents for comic characterization take flight.  Hugh Grant is essentially Hugh Grant &#150; which is to say that he fulfills the requirements of his part without having to stretch his thespian muscles too much.The success or failure of a comedy is ultimately determined by how often it is able to elicit laughs from the person watching it.  Given that criterion, `Small Time Crooks' rates no better than a mild recommendation (though there is one very funny scene involving safecracking near the end of the film).  Yet, if for no other reason than to relish a number of its dazzling performances, `Small Time Crooks' certainly earns at least a casual once-over from any Allen devotee.  Guess we have no choice but to mark time right along with him!

It's funny, and Allen fans will enjoy it, but it's certainly not an outstanding comedy.Allen plays Ray, a schlub living in New York who concocts a crazy scene to rob a bank.  It involves a cookie store, a tunnel, and lots of drilling.  It also stirs up one of the two out-and-out hilarious sequences in the movie. After the digging sequence, the film takes an unexpected turn (which I will let you discover for yourself), and the section immediately following the One Year Later card is the best of the film.  Sadly, the brilliant media satire and perfect lines are not repeated again in the film. for the remaining hour.A lot of people have commented how this is Woody getting back to his roots.  Certainly the film starts off like a lot of his early works, and the premise certainly shares a good deal with Take the Money and Run, but I would not put Small Time Crooks on the same level as that film, one of my favorite comedies.  While it's certainly a lighter film than his later works, Allen just doesn't have the same bizarre gags and total disregard for reality that the early works had.  That insane-genius-laughing-at-us-all energy is missing.Still, the film looks great and the cast is especially good.  I'm sorry we didn't get to see more of Michael Rappaport and John Lovitz, who sadly only appear in the first portion of the film.  Again, the movie isn't bad, it's just no Take the Money and Run.  Recommended for Woody fans, but I wouldn't say expect the old master here, rather expect an older master doing his best to relive those early greats.

Allen wrote and directed the film, which is pure Allen. This amusing  filmmaker brings a focused sensation of clumsiness and silliness to the various ensemble of characters; this movie is classy, sharp, and funny. 	Woody Allen stars as an ex-con named Ray Winkler, currently employed as a local dishwasher. He is the kind of person who comes up with maniac ideas he explains as beneficial, but they end up causing more grief than gratitude. His mangy wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman) is sick of her loser lifestyle, so when Ray proposes to burglarize a nearby bank with his old buddies, including Denny (Michael Rapaport), Tommy (Tony Darrow), and Benny (Jon Lovitz), she reluctantly agrees.	Ray comes up with a scheme that consists of renting a storefront next to the bank in order to tunnel a passage way into their destination. To avoid suspicion, Frenchy and her cousin May (Elaine May) open a bakery offering cookies as the four criminals screw everything up in the basement. The cookie sales unexpectedly become a massive achievement, leading to the characters opening up a corporation that makes them rich.The film's setup introduces the main characters with intelligent humor and riffraff detail. We learn they are unintelligent, desperate, and deprived nobodies living in unmistakable poverty without purpose or hope of a decent future. Also decently developed is the story, with a clear, stable first act and early laughs to capture the audience's attention from the start. This is the kind of movie that relies on situations to pull its characters through the story, and Allen gives the script fresh twists, active subplots, and creativity.Small Time Crooks is a character movie; a study of well-acted personas given funny edge and dimension. The characters are dazzlingly portrayed by some of the most clever names in Hollywood. Woody Allen rehearses his basic charismatic personality that we all know and love, and brackets himself between witty dialogue and well-cast supporting actors. Tracey Ullman is perfect in a role seemingly prepared towards her performance and Hugh Grant's false charming tenderness creates a despicable image in which the audience opposes but enjoys.The movie's story clearly exhibits the life of Ray and Frenchy, which is probably the smartest level in which it succeeds. We see gradual changes in the two as the story uses side characters as benchmarks that help to propel the plot along. There is minute tension involved with Ray and his spouse, however, although the Hugh Grant character provides a little romantic competition. If I had to change something in this movie, I would increase the level of the story's stakes and change the horridly annoying soundtrack.	Too much of this movie relies on dialogue to pull itself through story slouches; at times the plot seems to drift and the character end up explaining developments and advancements. Small Time Crooks does not suffer to immensely in result of this material because Woody Allen often supports his dialogue with visual story and amusing conversations that look as if especially written for each character in each scene.Small Time Crooks furnishes seeking audiences with effective comedy. So often we desire for comic adventures only to find contrived and recycled humor in stale stories. This film succeeds in perspiring light-hearted humor with a surprising human dimensional touch. Small Time Crooks will not disappoint fans of Woody Allen's gawky sense of humor.    "},{"Title":"Woody Lite","Date":"30 May 2000","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Like Mighty Aphrodite and Manhattan Murder Mystery, Small Time Crooks is the kind of movie Woody Allen would have made lots more of if he hadn't, in the post Annie Hall 1970s, started thinking of himself primarily as film auteur, rather than comedian. I count myself among those who are very glad he made the detour into Art that produced such original and challenging films as Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Husbands and Wives, and Deconstructing Harry. Small Time Crooks has a much lower level of ambition. Still, like most people in the audience at the showing I attended, I found much in it very amusing. The film's comic plot starts out like Take the Money and Run revisited, but then takes a number of surprising turns. Along the way, Tracy Ullman, Elaine Stritch, and - especially - Elaine May all give scene-stealing performances. Early Woody one-liners and sight gags sparkle through the script (along with, unfortunately, a higher frequency of duds and chestnuts than in early Woody). Also adding an interesting dimension to the comedy is the influence of The Honeymooners on the relationship between Ray and Frenchie Winkler (Woody and Tracy) and on the film's fish-out-of-water class-based situation comedy. Woody has often professed his admiration for The Honeymooners, but this is the first film where he seems to have consciously reached for similar themes and effects. On the down side, some of the plot twists seem downright arbitrary and amateurish, especially those involving Frenchie's comeuppance. Inadequate comic use is made of Ray's gang of losers (Jon Lovitz has one good line and too little screen time). And Hugh Grant as a Bluebeard wannabe is too much to ask of any audience. As to Woody himself .... what can you say? It's painful to watch his late career hardening of the comic arteries into stiff, unintentional self-parody. Let's hope the next Allen movie marks a return to high directorial ambition and low (as in no) acting profile.

His very first movies were slapstick comedies and then once in a while, after Annie Hall, he made a comedy or two. Small Time Crooks is one of his lesser movies, not on quality but more on terms of release. Small Time Crooks was pretty much ignored on its release.Allen plays Ray Winkler, officially the world's lamest looking criminal. Allen and his friends (Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow) plan to break into a bank and get rich. How? Well, it's a complicated plan. Ray's wife, Frenchy, (Tracey Ullman) is to rent a pizza shop and make cookies as a coverup for the men drilling in the basement. However, to Ray's disarray, the pizza shop is already rented out. Ray checks it out and realises that he knows the guy who rented it. Turns out they were cellmates. The guy (Jon Lovitz) joins them into the plan. Ray turns out to be a huge dumbass and can't make the tunnel under the bank. On top, however, Frenchy is having a huge success with her cookies. She hires her cousin May (Elaine May) to help her. The timeline then jumps a year and Ray and Frenchy have become extremely wealthy. They own a huge chain of cookie shops and are now part of the nouveau rich. They meet with David (Hugh Grant), whom Frenchy hires to teach her about culture. Without revealing more, let's just say it screwed up.Woody is his usual, neurotic self and as usual gives a solid if unimpressive performance. Ullman, as his stripper-turned-cookie-mogul wife, is very good and very funny. It's a shame she isn't in movies more. The rest of the cast is also good, with standouts being Elaine May and Jon Lovitz even though he's not on screen very long.Small Time Crooks starts out as a funny, slapstick comedy but then takes a turn when they become rich. Now, the title is Small Time Crooks. I was expecting some crookery. I saw some crookery, but not enough. It should have been called Cookie Mogul or something. I realises that it wouldn't have been very good as an all-out caper comedy but about 20 minutes of more crookery wouldn't have hurt. There's also the fact that this movie lags at times, enough to hurt it. And Hugh Grant is unimpressive in a role that could've been more.Woody Allen is an acquired taste. You may not like it or you may worship it.

Upon repeated viewing, though, I realised I had been wrong. It is light-hearted and funny on the surface, but much much deeper than it first seems.

I like his earlier movies where he was simply funny and not trying to figure out the meaning of life or display the ennui of rich Manhattanites. I find those films incredibly ponderous and self-indulgent. But stuff like 'Play it Again Sam' (even though it has the equally whiny Diane Keaton), or 'Take the Money and Run' were his best films.This film is a return to simple funny. One thing that happened while watching this movie about 20 minutes into the movie I felt something about this movie was strange, but I couldn't figure out what. Then it hit me no swearing. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie directed at adults that didn't have swearing. I'm not against swearing in movies by any means, but I have to say, I found it really refreshing. The script was forced to find the funny for real, rather on shock value. Needless to say, it also thankfully doesn't have any of the gross-out humour that passes for comedy in most films these days either. In the hands of most writers, it's not about pushing boundaries, but simply revealing the lack of genuine talent.Although Ullman does a very good job, and Allen is at his comedic best, Elaine May really shines through in her role and is the one that makes me smile the most. It's a shame that she doesn't get, or take, more roles.

Together, they winningly play Ray and Frenchy, a vulgar, working-class married couple who rent a restaurant space in order to rob the bank next door. The twist is that Frenchy's cookie business thrives, and they become wealthy beyond their dreams. Written and directed by Allen, this surprisingly free-wheeling 2000 comedy contains little of the deeper life themes that Allen had been exploring for the previous two decades. For the most part, it represents a complete throwback to his first film as a director, the frenetic, nonsensical 1969's Take the Money and Run, as both are character-driven slapstick farces with a slew of funny one-liners.The film starts out strong with Ray and his bumbling partners preparing the heist with every conceivable complication standing in their way, in particular, their own stupidity. The storyline makes a unique turn once Ray and Frenchy become successful. They open up a nationwide chain of cookie stores, move to the posh Upper East Side like the Jeffersons, and start hobnobbing with Manhattan's York's social elite. Their marriage begins to unravel when Frenchy becomes obsessed with being cultured, while Ray is happy to live his life the same way as before. I don't think the movie is consistently flat-out funny like Allen's earlier works, but it does boast a sterling comedy cast. Freed from his intellectual pretensions, Allen looks like he's having a good time playing the unapologetically guttural Ray. Sporting a convincing New Yawk accent, Ullman, the most chameleonic of comic mimics, dexterously captures the ongoing battle between Frenchy's aspirations for social acceptance and her innately tawdry sensibilities.Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz play Ray's trio of thick-skulled cohorts with √©lan, though they unfortunately disappear for the film's second half. It's good to see Elaine May back on screen playing Ray's ditzy cousin May, and her crack timing with Allen makes me wish she would resuscitate her clever comedy routines with her ex-husband, film director Mike Nichols. As Frenchy's Pygmalion teacher of art and manners, Hugh Grant plays to his suave persona with subtle venality. The film ends almost like a parable albeit with a hilarious development inspired by the cocktail party scene in Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious. Allen must be quite a fan since he would later use the same plot device in Scoop. This is lightweight fare though certainly among Allen's most entertaining movies of late. The 2000 DVD provides the theatrical trailer as its only significant extra.

Allen's wife (a show-stopping role for Tracy Ullman) cannot cook pizza though so she makes cookies instead with the help of dumb cousin Elaine May. As Allen and his cohorts try to make the heist happen, they run into problem after problem and in the process Ullman starts making a killing in her cookie business. Surprisingly it appears that the money from the bank job will not be needed as the new cookie business will make Allen, Ullman and everyone else previously mentioned very rich. But what happens when Allen and Ullman become socialites in a wealthy New York society that may not accept them? Could Ullman get suckered by the suave Hugh Grant? Could Allen actually find love with May instead? And will Allen be able to hold back his urge to steal even though he has all the money and status he needs now? Small Time Crooks was really ignored by most everyone in 2000, but it becomes one of Allen's finer productions by the end of its laugh-a-minute running time. Admittedly, it does not hold a candle to Allen masterpieces Annie Hall, Manhattan and Hannah and Her Sisters, but it stands tall with winners like Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask, Bullets Over Broadway and Mighty Aphrodite.

They can't force me to. I don't feel funny. I look around the world, and all I see is human suffering. This set a tone for many of his later, great works.I'm a big Woody Allen fan. I'm glad he's directed about a film a year for thirty plus years. (I loved Kubrick, but I got tired waiting for a film to become perfect enough for him to release it.) I always look forward to Woody's next release. I see whatever it is as soon as I can. SMALL TIME CROOKS was no exception. The cast sounded great (as usual), I had no idea what the film was about (just the way he wants it), and for a change, the early reviews were very positive. Allen's funniest film in years. Comparisons to BANANAS and Take the MONEY AND RUN were drawn.Oh my! I very rarely walk out on films. I've never walked on a Woody Allen film. I came so close to leaving in this film. The yammering interplay between Woody and Tracy Ullman was as irritating as that between Woody and Diane Keaton in MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, one of his few dogs. This seemed a misguided attempt at a return to being funny but with very little insight. Now I see why Elaine May doesn't appear in films, and Hugh Grant, as usual lately, looked out of place and uncomfortable.I like the Woody Allen who sees that matter is decaying, that he is as bad a person as we think he is, and that humanity is only human. Please Mr. Allen, do mankind a favor. Tell funnier jokes. This kind of slapstick is beneath you and your fans. But when you've made so many films even a genius is allowed a dud, I guess.

Allen who is as the title says, a small time crook who has done small time in the joint and has collected a gang of misfits just like him. Probably he saw the famous Edward G. Robinson classic Larceny, Inc. where Robinson and his associates buy a luggage store because of its location next to a bank where the plan is to tunnel from the store basement into the bank and rob it. Naturally Allen claims this as his original scheme.But to do that Allen has to have a business and that's where his bimbo of a wife Tracey Ullman comes in. She has one talent, she bakes some really out of this world cookies, cookies that Famous Amos would envy. They catch on and even when a cop catches Allen and his crew breaking into the bank he wants in on the business, the cookie business.But these rather unsophisticated Small Time Crooks who are all of a sudden fabulously wealthy find that it doesn't wear well on them. Both Allen and Ullman become targets of all kinds of big time crooks. Ullman has this lizard of an art dealer/gigolo played by Hugh Grant putting the moves on her. As she is the one with the recipe for the cookies, the money is all in her name. Woody in the meantime finds a sympathetic ear in Elaine May.As Small Time Crooks was getting started I thought I was watching a remake of Larceny, Inc. I thought I was watching a remake. But Woody Allen took it way beyond what Warner Brothers had in mind for that 1942 film. He and Ullman are a perfectly matched pair and in a weird way they show that money might buy happiness, but happiness means different things to different people.It's not Allen's best effort, but Small Time Crooks will definitely find an audience.

But compared to a lot of Allen's other films, it was also uneven and disappointing. Getting onto the many good stuff, Small Time Crooks is beautifully photographed and there is a great use of locations, which look similarly great. Most of the acting is great, especially from Tracy Ullman who is splendid and Elaine May who is ditsy, charming and her comic timing is priceless. Woody Allen- whose directing I don't have a problem with here- gives a good performance too that does remind you of some of his earlier work. Jon Lovitz and Michael Rappaport are a lot of fun in the little screen time we see them in. The first half is great as well, with very witty and sharp writing that feels like a throwback to Allen's earlier wisecrack comedies and that was part of the appeal. In typical Allen fashion as well there is a lot to say on issues and relationships and it's done insightfully. The three main characters are compellingly drawn. Sadly, the second half doesn't match up, the pace sags, the writing is not as witty and sometimes take a patronising approach and the characters that made the first half entertaining disappear and are forgotten about seemingly. And while as said the acting is fine, Lovitz and Rappaport did deserve more to do, Elaine Stritch is pretty wasted and I wasn't enamoured by Hugh Grant here either, his character was underwritten and the performance felt too much of a self-parody. The story is not as interesting in this half either with some plot strands underdeveloped and clumsily resolved. In conclusion, enjoyable, well made and performed but lesser and uneven Woody Allen. 6/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"That great Allen spirit.","Date":"26 June 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" I love this period in Woody Allen's work. The 90s were a time when he made several filmed experiments. He made a social satire, a musical, a character study and semi-autobiographical study of his relationships with women. I'm glad that Woody is trying new things but STC reminded me of what I loved about his work in the first place He can write comedies that are very, very funny STC is a flat out comedy, it has no other reasons for being then to make us laugh. It is inventive and sweet and Allen has not only surrounded himself with a cast of wonderfully talented actors but puts a new spin on his nebbish persona.Here's the story Allen and Tracy Ullman play a blue collar couple living the in middle class doldrums of New York City. Allen is a professional criminal who hits upon the idea of renting out a store and having his wife sell cookies as a front while he and his cohorts are in the basement digging a tunnel to the bank next door. The heist is bungled when Allen and his cronies end up in a dress shop while Ullman is in the front making a fortune selling cookies. The become millionaires in the cookie business.Now, this would have been enough for any other comedy but this is Woody Allen, he has other surprises up his sleeve. The couple live it up, Ullman trying to fit into the Manhattan social scene can't escape the fact that she is a butcher to good taste (Just how much leopard skin can you fit into one Penthouse?) Allen (a sullen, dimwitted slob) on the other hand is just as happy eating cheeseburgers and watching the Nicks game The two have a wonderful rapport together but the plumb part goes to Elaine May who plays Ullman's cousin. She all but steals the show in the scene where Allen is suppose to rob a rich socialite's safe during a party. He tells her to mingle and talk about the weather. She does just that, giving out weather reports.What I loved about STC is that it never tries to be anything more than what it is, it's a flat out comedy. But, Woody being the genius writer that he is takes what would have been otherwise just a comic idea and takes it one step furthur. It is fun to watch a comedy this inventive.

Allen plays Ray, a small time crook, who has served time for robbery, but has not learned his lesson. He formulates another illegal scheme. He tells his long-suffering wife Frenchy, (Tracey Ullman) that this time he knows his plan will work. He and his friends are going to tunnel under a bank and steal the money at night. (Ray is a good safe-cracker, whatever his other inadequacies may be.)Allen surrounds himself with other crooks, all as inept as he is. They argue about whether he was called The Brain in prison because he was smart, or whether the other prisoners were being sarcastic. (We never find out, but I suspect the latter explanation.) Naturally, the plan goes hopelessly awry. However, as a cover for their activity in the building, Frenchy has started a cookie business. In a typically New York kind of response, people love her cookies. They demand her cookies. They will wait endlessly in line for her cookies. Almost instantaneously, the crooks own a multi-million dollar legitimate bakery business.The plot thickens when Frenchy decides that her life style--and her life--need to be commensurate with her new-found wealth. She hires art dealer and cad David (Hugh Grant) to teach her how to be a sophisticated socialite. Naturally, complications ensure. From there, the plot moves forward in predictable--but humorous--ways.Watch for Elaine May as Frenchy's very dim cousin May. (I've noticed this about Woody Allen. In most movies, someone may be perceived as slow in the beginning of the film, but by the end, they have demonstrated true wisdom. Not so for Woody. Start slow, end slow.) The ultimate New Yorker, Elaine Stritch, has a cameo role as socialite Chi Chi Potter. Anyone could have played the part. I think Woody just wanted to have Stritch in the movie to tell us, This is New York, and nowhere else.We saw the film on DVD, and it worked well on the small screen. This is pretty lightweight Woody, but for me, any Woody is worth seeing. So, if you have an hour and a half to spare, check out Small Time Crooks.Personal note Life imitates art. My cousin became a millionaire by franchising chocolate chip cookies. However, he didn't arrive at that career by starting out to rob a bank.

Perhaps it had been so long since Allen has done an all-out comedy, he couldn't keep up the momentum until movie's end.Allen plays Ray, one of the titular characters, as a variation on his schleppy booking agent in Broadway Danny Rose. His clothing is only slightly louder than his complaining, and he gesticulates wildly, as though his hands have minds of their own. And Tracey Ullman, as Ray's social-climbing wife Frenchy, certainly seems a perfect match for him. (Allen doesn't have much originality in creating tacky characters--when in doubt, he throws on the plaids and has everyone screech their lines.) Ray, a reformed criminal, plots a scheme to return to his life of crime. There's a vacant building a couple of doors down from a bank, and he figures he can use the building as a front so he can tunnel to the bank and grab the bank's loot. The front will be a shop for Frenchy's homemade cookies, while Ray and his henchmen drill underneath the shop.Comparisons to Allen's first feature, Take the Money and Run, are inevitable and (for the first part of the movie, at least) worthy. Ray's blunders with his no-brain partners (Michael Rapaport and Saturday Night Live alumnus Jon Lovitz) are a slapstick delight. And when their (mis)fortunes take an unexpected turn for the richer, the movie seems meant to live up to its early promise.But then, after a half-hour of making fun of these lowlifes, the movie asks us to take their plight seriously--if you can call getting unexpectedly rich a plight. Frenchy hires a stuffy art curator (Hugh Grant) in hopes of furthering her education (shades of Annie Hall). Ray, feeling Frenchy drifting away from him, starts to fall for her dimwitted cousin (Elaine May). And the movie audience suddenly feels the movie's sense of fun drifting away.Why the movie suddenly dismisses the bungling bankrobber trio is a mystery, but dismiss them it does, as though they were a plot device which Allen quickly tired of. The cookie-shop front might have been funnier if Frenchy's creativity with cookies benefited everybody except for Ray. (A similar premise propelled Albert Brooks' The Muse, and Crooks even borrows Muse's plot device of the wife finding unexpected success with making cookies.) Instead, the movie replaces its prime source of laughs with schlocky pathos. The camera closes in on Frenchy's face when she realizes her rich friends have been making fun of her, and suddenly the plot goes from the highs of The Muse to the lows of The Flintstones. The cast wavers all over the place. Allen is in his slapstick element, doing physical schtick he hasn't attempted in ages and pulling it off. And Lovitz and Rapaport are delightfully dumb. On the other hand, Hugh Grant's role is underwritten, and Elaine May's is just plain *not* written. Allen seems to have a thing for dumb brunettes, and May adds nothing to the role except catatonia.Allen is so fearful of being reminded of his earlier, funnier movies that each time he tries for purely funny, he seems a little more removed from the source. Crooks has its fair share of laughs (though more at the start than at the end), but finding comedy in silly characters and then asking us to feel unearned sympathy for them plays less like early Allen and more like latter-day Jerry Lewis.

The characters are never particularly engaging, and Allen himself is surprisingly annoying in this one. There are a couple of bright spots though, and they can come from where you least expect it. For instance Hugh Grant is really good in this movie. He may not be in it much, but it was refreshing to see him play something slightly different for once. Slightly. The best part of the movie is Elaine May's character though. The idiot character is probably the easiest part to write, but some of her lines are really quite inventive.

The problems begin when the cookies become so popular that the store starts to gain a lot of attention and could potentially become as big a moneymaker as the bank job.It may not be Woody Allen's most stellar cast but this movie boasts some great turns - Allen himself is his usual bag of tics and neuroses, Ullman is superb as the wife who wants a better life, Elaine May is entertainingly stupid and there is a great turn from Hugh Grant before he was set free to properly show his comedy chops in some fine British efforts. There are also great performances from the likes of Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz (though all of them are slightly underused).The script may not be the finest Allen work when it comes to gags-per-minute but when the laughs DO come they're a great mix of easy, dumb fun and superb set-piece moments (two robberies are highlights as is Ullman's attempt at entertaining some upper class socialites). I liked this movie the first time I saw it and, even after viewing many of the director's earlier and superior works, I like it just as much now. It's a lot of fun, nothing more and nothing less.

Even though Small Time Crooks did on occasion have me laughing, and almost always smiling, it left me wanting more. The real problem with the film however, is that it really does not amount to as much as Woody Allen probably thinks it does. He makes the whole thing seem more elaborate than necessary. The end result is contrived, rather pointless, and is accompanied by a rushed ending.Ray and Frenchy are a 'not so charming' New York couple living in a tiny apartment, but Ray has some big plans for getting dough. A pizza place across from a nearby bank has just closed. He wants to buy the store, turn it into a cookie shop (his wife makes cookies).

The rest of the movie, provokes chuckles at best. Woody Allen does however successfully maintain an active screen presence. Even at sixty, he still has a performer left in him. Actually having seen Scoop, it's easy to argue that he still has it in him in age seventy.Scoop may actually be a better film to see if you wanna get a peek at the older Woody Allen.

It's so strange that this movie was the first in 5 movies Dream Works, yes the mighty Dream Works ITSELF, offered to Woody to produce !!!! So, that's what Woody insists to do even with BIG BUCKS budget ???I hated the way Woody performed it  Woody is still Woody. And I mean it in all the awful senses. And guess what ? That's boring before being indigent ! Aside from nice performance comes from most of the cast, it shows that his remarks (as a director) for himself (as an actor) are none ! It's natural that his performance deteriorates as he ages; the man nearly didn't work with directors along the years but himself ! Just watch the scene in which his character is confused about the real necklace in front of the safe to catch on what I mean ! (what's more painful than a comic star in a comic situation where no comedy is produced !).He thinks himself Charles Chaplin. However Chaplin did present different roles, even if he failed. He thinks that he creates simplicity but it is dull, monotonous, and killing the amusement of the script. He thinks that he makes Hollywood old classics-like yet independently, and he does, but on so low level and not as entertaining as we got before (whether from the old classic Hollywood, or the old classic Woody !). As you see, the man thinks a lot already, and nobody rethinks for him! So  the casting was good, but the good characters got to leave early. The heist story was promising, but it got to leave early. The lines were funny, but with this directing I wanted to leave early ! Though, I completed it to witness eventually not the pure Woody Allen, but the poor Woody Allen ! Or maybe that is what the pure Woody Allen is all about lately !Simply the thing about his work since the 1990s is that dealing with the idea became not as its beauty. And how these movies sure got sense of loveliness but without the same liveliness that we used to have from him once (remember how the image was turning into cartoon in Annie Hall, where is THAT Woody ?!). It's not where I say my condolence is the funny lines. No. It's where I say my condolence to the funny lines.

The wife will sell her homemade cookies in the front of the store as a distraction while the men drill in the back ... but what happens is a turn of events nobody was prepared for. I think this particular title was important at the time of its release because it was the first in awhile where Woody Allen went from being deep and introspective to just being plain silly and fun once again. I've come to enjoy this one more now than I did upon its initial release, but it's really the first half that is stronger than the second. Still a pleasant time waster at any rate. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence where tough-talking Woody is trying to intimidate his even tougher wife into investing in his brainstorm, as it smacks of vintage Honeymooners trappings, which I'd bet was on Allen's mind when he made this. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"And so the cookie crumbles","Date":"21 December 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Well now we have a ex-crook played by Woody Allen and his wife are looking to make a bit of extra money so they plan on robbing a bank.

They decide to hit the bank by burrowing from underneath via an abandoned bakery next door and Woody's wife (Tracy Ullmann) provides a front for them by opening up a gourmet cookie store. In a classic Allen plot twist, they bungle the robbery but the cookies become a smash,making Woody and Tracy millionaires;however,they learn that money does not guarantee social acceptance. Woody tells an entertaining story here with a master hand...he offers one of his funniest screenplays anchored by razor-sharp direction and,as usual, a wonderful hand-picked cast. Woody and Ullmann are absolutely hysterical together and mention should also be made of supporting turns by Hugh Grant and the fabulous Elainie May, who steals every scene she's in. It takes a little while to get going, but stick with it...it will be worth it. "},{"Title":"Rambling but successful comedy.","Date":"18 March 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" It's divided into three parts. (1) Woody and an inept gang set up a cookie store as a front, to be run by Woody's wife, Tracy Ullman, while they tunnel through the store's basement into the bank next door. (2) The robbery fails but the cookie store succeeds beyond anyone's imagination and Woody and Tracey become rich. (3) Tracey falls for a phony art dealer and Woody takes up with his sister-in-law, May, Elaine May. When the cookie franchise goes bankrupt the couple get together and it all ends happily.The first part seems somewhat detached from the rest of the movie. Most of the main characters disappear from the film in the two later sections. It's almost a film in itself. And actually I think it just about was -- called Larceny, Inc. back in the 1940s.Part two is transitional and is the most nearly serious (and least amusing) part. Ullman wants to learn how to be classy from Hugh Jackman but is flatly unable to overcome her innate vulgarity. My God, her taste is awful. Woody is forced to wear clothes that are in themselves lessons of dissonance -- a royal blue jacket with canary yellow trousers. He refuses to look at a wall on which an abstract expressionless painting hangs and has the butler read him the time from the clock hanging next to the dreadful thing.The third part revolves around Woody's plan to switch a cheap fake for a terminally expensive necklace at a fancy party. The plot is silly but Elaine May carries the day as a complete dodo. Some of the gags are simple minded and others a little more complex. I'll give an example of an exchange between May and a guest at the formal party that illustrates both kinds of jokes. May has been ordered by Woody to keep quiet and play lookout and to say nothing except maybe about the weather. Something like this.May There's a warm front moving over the city. Guest You know, you're the most charming woman I've met since my dear, departed wife. I noticed you when you first entered the room, the way you carried yourself. May You can't carry yourself. That's physically impossible. Guest, laughing Really, you remind me so much of Helen. May Who's Helen? Was she your wife or just some woman who died? Later May tells Woody He said I reminded him of his dead wife. I assume he meant while she was still alive. There's still another reference to this exchange but I think I'll quit.This is one of Woody's better recent comedies. He's the nervous street-wise schlub that he was in Broadway Danny Rose. If you liked that one, you ought to enjoy this one. "},{"Title":"A Victim of his Own Success","Date":"10 September 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Possible spoilersWoody Allen has become the victim of his own success. It is often said that his recent offerings do not come up to the standard of his great films of the seventies and eighties. In my opinion that is, to some extent, true. I have not seen any truly great Allen film, measured by the standards of 'Annie Hall' or 'Manhattan', since 'Hannah and Her Sisters' in 1986 and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' three years later. Nevertheless, he has made a number of very good ones. Most filmmakers would be delighted to count among their oeuvre just one film as good as 'Manhattan Murder Mystery', 'Bullets Over Broadway', 'Mighty Aphrodite' or 'Sweet and Lowdown'; the fact that Allen can lay claim to all of those suggests that it is premature to write him off as a spent force. One criticism that could fairly be made of Allen is that he has a limited range as an actor, although he can be very good within that range. His normal screen persona is that of the neurotic, intellectual Bohemian middle-class New Yorker, but in 'Small Time Crooks' he is clearly trying to extend his scope. He, unusually, casts himself as a working-class character, Ray Winkler, an unsuccessful New Jersey petty criminal. (Despite this, he still looks and sounds much the same as he does in his other films). Ray's latest scheme is to rob a bank by tunnelling into it from the shop next door. To divert suspicion, he persuades his wife Frenchie to bake cookies and to sell them from the shop. Thanks to Ray's incompetence, the bank robbery does not come off, but Frenchie's cookie business proves a surprise success, and within a year the Winklers find themselves the millionaire bosses of a prosperous bakery enterprise. The film then moves into the realms of social satire. Frenchie, like many another nouveau-riche, longs to be accepted into New York high society, but her vulgar and ostentatious displays of wealth quickly make her a laughing-stock among the old-money elite. (Allen clearly has no time for the theory that America is a classless society without the social distinctions that mark the Old World). In a variation on the 'My Fair Lady' story, Frenchie befriends David, an upper-class English art-dealer, and persuades him to try and teach her about art, literature, fine wines and social etiquette so that she can pass herself off as a cultured person of taste and breeding. Ray, on the other hand, has no time for culture. Rather than visit art galleries and expensive restaurants, he would prefer to live the life of a couch potato, watching television and eating cheeseburgers. Despite the success of the cookie business, he still frets for his earlier, simpler life as a criminal. Forgetting that he was a totally incompetent one, he dreams of pulling off one last spectacular heist. Unlike some, I did not think that Allen was trying to preach or moralise in this film. There is certainly no suggestion that those of working-class origins should stick to cheeseburgers and televised sport rather than interest themselves in culture. The only thing wrong with Frenchie's programme of self-education is that (unlike, say, the Julie Walters character in 'Educating Rita') she is doing it for the wrong reasons, out of snobbery rather than out of genuine interest. There is, perhaps, the implication that many of the more established members of New York society are just as shallow as Frenchie; they are merely better at hiding their shallowness behind a veneer of sophistication. If there is a moral, it is perhaps that small time crooks like Ray and his gang (portrayed as endearingly inept) are less dangerous than big time white-collar crooks like the accountants who defraud Ray and Frenchie of their wealth, or even David, who might not break any laws but who turns out to be as grasping and materialistic as any criminal. The two main sources of humour in the film are Frenchie's social pretensions (she loves to use long words, but only those beginning with A, as she has not yet got round to reading the rest of the dictionary) and the bumbling incompetence of Ray and his gang. (The bank raid, for example, misfires because Ray misreads the map and ends up tunnelling into a dress shop rather than into the bank). Allen's performance in this film is a fairly restrained one; he is outshone by Tracey Ullman, who gives a delightfully over-the-top performance as the loud and vulgar Frenchie, the sort of nouveau-riche who has been the butt of satire ever since Moliere's 'bourgeois gentilhomme', or even Trimalchio in Petronius's 'Satyricon'. Hugh Grant is an actor with as limited a range as Allen, but like Allen he can excel within that range, and he is excellent here as David, the suave but hypocritical upper-class English gentleman. The film as a whole is not, perhaps, first-class vintage Allen, but it is still entertaining, and even non-vintage Woody Allen is better than most recent film comedies. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Take the Money and Run 2000","Date":"24 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  The Blues Brothers had their 2000 sequel, so why not Woody Allen?

I found the humor to be a little familiar but refreshingly clean (it was his first PG movie since Manhattan Murder Mystery), and I really liked the way the plot completely switched gears midway through.  Tracey Ullman was actually funnier than anyone else in the cast (including Allen), and created one of Woody Allen's best female heroines with her Frenchie.   This was his first movie of the oughts, and paved the way for his next wave of films, each one sillier than the previous one.

Hugh Grant does Hugh Grant, as always, but the part itself lacks something and Hugh probably does not play to Woody's directorial strengths.  Woody himself is miscast in this film - the only scene of his that works for me is the scene where his old con buddy tries to convince him that his jail nickname The Brain was sarcasm.It attempts sophistication - there are multiple sets of small time crooks one set for each of the three plot sections.  This multi-layering of issues is relatively ineffective in this movie - see Crimes and Misdemenours and/or Hannah and Her Sisters for far better use of the technique (indeed both are better movies in every way).  The fact that one bunch of crooks is unseen throughout leaves this movie with a denouement almost as unsatisfying as and then he woke up - it had all been a dream.It has its moments, but they are too few and the standard we expect from Woody is that much higher.

The clue is the one-liner about Henry James - when Frenchy Winkler (Tracey Ullman) and David (Hugh Grant) are passing a bookshop or cinema, and Frenchy mixes the great writer up with Harry James, the trumpeter. One of Henry James's constant themes is the mutual impact of the New World and the Old, usually to the detriment of the former.  (Two recent movies of his books -Wings of the Dove and The Golden Bowl -have both involved  this theme.)In this movie, after they come into money in a thoroughly American way, by failing to rob a bank, and succeeding in running a cookie business, Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) and Frenchy also flirt with European culture, in the shape of furniture, paintings, theatre, literature and, in Frenchy's case, the suave English art dealer, David.  Initially, the New Yorkers are outwitted, estranged and bankrupted by  the Old World; but US savvy  eventually wins through, and the couple decide to settle for their former comfortable American lifestyle. Woody Allen himself has also flirted with European influences in his time, making dark Bergmanesque dramas like Interiors, intellectual Godardian comedies like Annie Hall, and even a Lang-like film-noir, Shadows and Fog. The message that comes over to me from Small Time Crooks is that in future Allen will resist these European tendencies, and will stick to home-spun Americana, which would please many of his fans, though personally I think it would be a pity. In fact, much the same message also came over from Allen's  documentary Wild Man Blues, where we followed his Jazz band round Europe. Some of his admirers this side of the Atlantic expected to see a Europhile culture-vulture, and instead were confronted by an all-American Philistine, who seemed unimpressed by the beauties of  Venice, and was suspicious of the plumbing even in the plushest of hotels!  (I'm still not sure if this portrait is the genuine Woody; but it makes little difference; it's the way he wanted to present himself.)To sum up see Small Time Crooks for its all-American humour; but possibly pine a little for the missing touch of French or Italian sophistication.

Apparently you either love his work or hate it - if that's the case then 'Small Time Crooks' places me firmly in the camp wondering why people pay money to watch his efforts.The film is split into two distinct parts, the first concerning Allen and his friends trying to tunnel into a bank using his wife's cookie shop as a front location. The second, longer half deals with the Winkler's attempts to adapt to high society after the cookie shop turns into a successful franchise. The plot is predictable and lightweight, and this is okay if other elements of the film compensate for it. Unfortunately they don't as, despite claiming to be a comedy, only the occasional one-liner raises a chortle. Direction is uninspiring and the camerawork pedestrian, while the acting veers between good and bad throughout the film.I find Tracy Ullman irritating at the best of times, so no favours are done when she adopts a New Jersey accent. I found neither her nor Allen's character garnered any sympathy at all, so I could not care less whether they made it to the all-too-predictable conclusion of the film, which although welcome seemed a little rushed. The main comedy was supposed to stem from how stupid the rest of the cast were, however   this cerebral deficiency seemed to be employed when convenient for a laugh, and sometimes the actors seemed uncharacteristically intelligent, especially Allen who clearly struggled to maintain the pretence of stupidity.So not encouraging as my first foray into the world of Woody, 'Small Time Crooks' is a predictable caper with more flaws than laughs. Hugh Grant was quite good, although he essentially played Hugh Grant.

It will be better for him as film maker and a screen writer and for us as an audience who like him and eagerly wait for his next project hopping that this time the master will come up with a film that will reminds us why we liked him so much in the past and why we are sometime disappointed from him today.

Will high society accept these latter day Kramdens, and how will affluence change their lives?  In a movie full of classic lines, perhaps the top banana belongs to David (Hugh Grant).  As a veiled illusion to Oscar Wilde, he comments on owning a picture of himself in his closet that keeps on getting younger.  Despite playing along an all-star cast including Jon Lovitz and Michael Rappaport, the only memorable supporting performer was May (Elaine May).

Roger Ebert describes Small Time Crooks as a flat-out comedy.  As a lover of comedies of all types, I found this movie to be just plain flat.  Allen plays a small time loser and terminal complainer married to the long-suffering Tracy Ullman, and decides to make a heist of a lifetime.  He enlists a lot of his old crime and cell-buddies, who are much funnier in their strangely abbreviated scenes than Allen is in the whole movie.  To be fair, he has written himself a rather thankless role, a none-too-bright whiner who complains about everything and is not funny in the least.  He plays this role well, but this is the kind of person you try to get away from on the bus and that you want to get away from in the theater.  The movie is misleading; it is not about small-time crooks.  It's a fish-out-of-water story about simple people thrust into high society based on Ullman's success, not her husband's.  Tracy Ullman is the only enjoyable thing in this movie, other than Elaine May, who is brilliant and leaves you scratching your head as to why the hell we haven't been seeing more of her throughout the years.  Some people found the movie cute.  Most I talked to afterward found it typical-annoying Allen.  As usual, the critics see the name, not the product.  If it had been written by Joe Shmerd, I doubt Maltin and Ebert would have praised it as they did.  The movie would have been helped tremendously if the supporting players had been allowed to be supporting players, i.e. much more of them, and less of Allen's annoying character.  The only laughs come from them!  And they are given about 30 seconds of time.  Hugh Grant is great the as unctuous art collector, playing straight-man, introducing Ullman into high society.  But where is the main story-line?  Forgotten about, along with other promising threads that werer laid down in the beginning.  As it is, this is actually Small Time Crook, without the plural.  And the crime is that once again we have been hoodwinked into spending nine bucks based on reviewers praising an over-hyped writer/director.  Sorry to be so critical; I liked Bananas, Of Love and Death, and Hannah and her Sisters as much as anyone.  But Allen is pretty much hit-and-miss, and lately it's been pretty much miss-and-miss...and miss... Four out of ten stars for me.  Without Ullman, it would have been much less.

An aging Woody looks and sounds as hilarious as ever as a small time loser who makes a fortune along with his wife and his seedy friends off their front for the real job which didn't go exactly as they planned.  The REAL stand out in this movie is Tracey Ullman who plays Allen's wife in the film.

This is Woody Allen being funny without any axes to grind, with much less neurosis nor self-deprecation, without too many marital complications; in short, a film much closer to Scenes from a Mall than to Husbands and Wives or Deconstructing Harry. Here is Allen enjoying himself with a remark about the c'mon back profession or the Polish car pool where everyone meets at work at the same time.  He is also harping back to two comedic couples he enjoyed, Ralph and Alice's knucklehead confrontations from 'The Honeymooners' and the seemingly moronic dialogue of Mike Nichols and Elaine May.  There is also a lot of malapropism in this movie, most of it funny, because all his characters are missing at least one screw - 'Treasure Island for Treasure of Sierra Madre', Harry James for Henry James, and 'one of those higher King Louies'.  Ray and Frenchy (aka Ralph and Alice but really Woody Allen and Tracy Ullman) get us going with an incessant trail of barbs and insults as Ray tries to pry away their life's savings for a not-too-well-thought-out bank robbery.  When Ray compliments himself as being Frenchy's smart husband, Frenchy says she must be a bigamist.  When Ray mentions his dumb conspirators to Frenchy, she remarks they must have been drafted right out of kindergarten.  Later we get Ray and Mae together (aka Nichols and May but this really is Elaine May) and they mesh even better as witness by their jewel heist at a rich couple's party when the nervous Ray has to deal with an even more nervous Mae.  As Mae is pretending to be ill, she starts to spurt out all her medical diagnoses she remembers from TV including hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and Ebola virus.  Allen made a misstep by excluding his trio of very comical bunglers (Tommy, Denny, and Benny) after they had all struck it rich and instead focused on the overdone relationship between Frenchy and David (played with hints of his real-life conniving by Hugh Grant) that worked only in spurts - Frenchy wanted David to educate her on fine arts and wine while poor Ray is only interested in learning to spell 'Connecticut'. Small Time Crooks isn't among Woody Allen's best works but it has enough chuckles to brighten your day and maybe remind you about this very delicate but funny thing we call the human condition.

But once the small-time crook Woody and his wife (Tracey Ullmann) are propelled into the world of museum boards and opera openings, the auteur gets to shift gears from GUYS AND DOLLS (not his forte) to LE BOURGEOIS GENTILHOMME (a little closer to it).

Jon Lovitz shows an actor's homespun wisdom he plays a moron who believes with every fibre of his being that he's both commonsensical and hip. Elaine May, as Ullmann's slowpoke cousin, may be the dimmest bulb in modern movies her idjit routine borders on mock-retardation, but her walking the line is dazzlingly bold and inventive.

You have to go back to Chaplin and Keaton to find another film maker who's in such total control of his work. He writes, directs, and acts with such skill and success that he has no equal today. It's hard to find anybody who doesn't have an opinion on him. People either think he's hilarious, or just not funny, or that he's (shudder) not as funny as he used to be. To each his own.

If I compared it to all his previous work, I'd end up telling you what it's not. Let me tell you what it is, or at least what I thought I saw. I saw shades of the younger Woody (he's 64 now, okay?) surrounded by newer people trying to entertain in a light and silly story that has a twist, or turn.Ray `The Brain' Winkler (The Wood Man), is an ex-con dishwasher with a scheme to rob a bank. Frenchy (Tracey Ullman, who was born to do this kind of thing), is his manicurist wife who also bakes cookies. He talks her into sinking their life savings into a plan he's devised with his buddies (Michael Rapaport, Jon Lovitz, and Tony Darrow). Frenchy's cousin May (the legendary Elaine May), becomes involved, and serves as the family's weak link. Usually, you expect that Allen's characters only success to be at failure. Expected him and his dim-witted gang to botch the robbery somehow. Maybe not so quickly. I expected them to... I don't know, not become rich and learn that they're better off that way. But Allen, in his unique way, asks the questions, `What if they got what they wished for? What would they do? What might become of them?' Some people should not be rich. They just aren't cut out to have wealth. Frenchy enlists the aid of David (Hugh Grant), a snobbish art dealer, to help her become cultured and refined, hence, the conflict and comedy. With all that talent involved, expectations run pretty high.There are some funny moments, some clever dialogue, and some reminders of scenes past, but this is not the best Woody Allen movie ever. It lacks a certain overall `oomph.' Not a lot of big laughs. The gang of crooks disappear in the middle, Elaine May has very little to do, and it never really turns wacky, zany, dangerous, outrageous, or totally hilarious. It becomes centered on Ray and Frenchy's relationship, and settles into a sentimental look at the couple. We're supposed to think that money is a real threat to their marriage, I guess. Allen and Ullman have great chemistry, and that's sweet, but it seems like it could have been put to better use. I'm not saying don't go see the movie. Just don't expect to be blown away by Woody's finest effort in years. We still have him, though. After 47 years in the comedy profession, he starts at least one new original project every fall. He's still at it, writing, directing, and acting. That's the main thing. Believe me. E-mail and comments are welcome.

Hugh Grant in particular seems to have read through the script about ten minutes before the scenes were shot, and his transformation at the end from slick weasel to near-sadist is completely unconvincing.  There are two major plot twists  the first is done well, the second comes out of nowhere, although we are told (not shown!) that Allen's character had suspected the culprits all along because they all wore mustaches.A few moments partly redeem this from being a complete turkey.  There is an absolutely hilarious TV News Feature sequence right after the crooks get rich; there is an amusing cocktail party near the end in which we discover that the rich and cultured are every bit as brainless and crass as the small time crooks; and Elaine May plays a character of transcendent dimness, a sort of demure Gracie Allen.  The rest is all a half-beat off, which is fatal to farce.  As others have noted, even the music, which is often a redeeming feature of Allen's movies, is below-par--why on earth is Tequila played during the last part of the closing credits?Increasingly, Allen's career as an auteur seems to be sputtering out.  Maybe he should stick to voice-overs.

Allen's manicurist wife played by Tracey Ullman sets up a cookie business to front the tunneling project.  As it turns out the heist falls apart but the cookie front makes millions.  This sets up the bulk of the film which becomes a story about class snobbery, popularity, and taking chances to finding happiness. Yet its Allen's funny script, great casting, and knowing how to direct comedy that make the film work.  Small Time Crooks isn't obsessed with sex, anti-semitism, or neurosis so to true Woody Allen fans will think Small Time Crooks is to conventional, to general audiences.  Allen writes a comic screenplay with only mild profanity and no over-the-top, shock-value humor which is rare accomplishment in screenwriting.  Allen knowledge of how to direct comedy is on target. Tracey Ullman is a perfect foil for Allen and audiences will be surprised by Elaine May as the lisping, if not overly bright distant relative.

The good ones will appeal to anyone watching them (SLEEPER, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and BULLETS OVER BROADWAY).  Then there are the films that people west of the Hudson River won't understand (MANHATTAN, CRIMES & MISDEMEANORS, and BROADWAY DANNY ROSE).  I'm kinda happy to say that Allen's new film, SMALL TIME CROOKS, will appeal to everyone, on both sides of the Hudson River.      SMALL TIME CROOKS has Allen playing a aging former criminal who wants to go back into bank robbing.  His wife (Tracey Ullman) who is a manicurist, thinks it's a bad idea. But that doesn't stop him, he gets his two friends (Michael Rapaport and Tony Darrow) to help him out.  They're going to buy a vacant building two stores down from the city bank, and sell cookies.  While they sell cookies as a cover up, they plan on digging to the bank and break in from the ground into the vault.  But when they want to buy the vacant space, it's already been bought by man who is a arsonist, (Jon Lovitz) so he can collect the insurance money.  So what could they do but include him on the deal.  Then the other problem arises, the cookies that the wife is making and selling, are a huge hit! Something that they didn't expect, and from there on it's a typical screwball Allen comedy.      SMALL TIME CROOKS is a decent Allen movie, the first half is Allen returning to his screwball comedy.  And that's the great part, it's so funny that I couldn't stop laughing.  It's similar to Allen's eariler comedies like BANNANAS, and SLEEPER. There are lots of physical and dialogue gags that are light weight.  Then by the second half, it sort of wears thin as it shows the difference between the high class societies.  But for a Woody Allen film, it's decent.      Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman both do respectable jobs in thier acting.  But Elaine May and Jon Lovitz steal the show in this film.  May is very funny as the ditzy relitive of Ullman who is a few cards short of a full deck.  And Lovitz is alsovery funny as the man who is included in on the deal at the last minute.  Plus kudos goes out to Michael Rapaport who tries to make robbing a cool image.     This is a film that most people over the age of fourty would enjoy, or those into movies.  But for those who enjoy their comedy with slapstick or sophmoric humor won't enjoy this. It's no AMERICAN PIE or ROAD TRIP style of humor, it's more intellectual.  Plus I don't know many people who can sit through Allen complaining throughout his films.     But this is lightweight comedy that does work most of the time, at least the first half.  Then like all of Allen's films the story takes a u-turn into something totally different than it began with.  This is a film to see if you're a Woody Allen fan or if you enjoy his films.  But if one too many New York City accents bother you, then see something else.  But since I'm kinda a Allen fan, it's enjoyable and one of his better films.  ***1/2 (out of five)  "},{"Title":"Classic Funny Woody, with great stuff from Ullman","Date":"8 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Good clean Funny Woody.

There was quite a bit I liked about Celebrity (1998), even if I was the only one, and there's likewise much to enjoy in Small Time Crooks. This film was marketed as a throwback to Allen's zany, screwball comedies of the early 70s, like Bananas or Sleeper. But it actually may surprise you as a much more substantive film than you are expecting, thanks almost exclusively to Tracy Ullman's marvelous performance as Allen's brassy, rough-edged wife, who unexpectedly finds herself ensconced in a high-class (or at least extremely wealthy) lifestyle. She is hilarious when called upon to be, but she also brings a lot of depth and compassion to a role that could easily have been nothing more than a broad caricature.

The second half of Small Time Crooks is not quite the same story.It switches paths early on and tries to go for a morality tale as opposed to a comic tale. Big mistake. Likable characters are shoved aside and literally forgotten amid the chaos of the movie that almost turns into an entirely new flick. It changes tracks and loses its humor and affection.The beginning of the film introduces us to Ray (Woody Allen), an ex-convict whose lust to rob a bank near his small apartment in New York City takes control of him. His ex-stripper wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), doesn't agree with his ruthless methods which always seem to go awry. But this time Ray is certain his plan will work.What is it? To purchase an old pizza shop in Manhattan a block down from the bank and then tunnel underground and come up underneath the vault. I've got blueprints, he says, trying to convince his wife to let him try. Frenchy knows something is up when he brings her chocolates. (Which, in the scene's funniest one-liner, he says are made by the Belgiumites.)He assembles a team of knuckleheads to help him, including Jon Lovitz, who bought the pizza shop under an alias so that he could burn it down later on. (How do you think I got three kids through college? he asks Ray.)The beginning scenes that reveal their pure idiotic methods are great; the characters are all attachable and the jokes are all sweet and laughable. But there's a twist--Ray never finishes tunneling under the bank, because the cookie store front above ground (being run by Frenchy) is making profits in the thousands; people line up the entire way down the street just to get a taste of her marvelous cookies.Some amount of time passes and their corporation grows. The cookie bakery chain grows larger and larger and expands across the nation, putting Frenchy and Ray in the spotlight as some of the richest idiots to ever make it big. Ray's gang of crooks are still there, too--the jobs fit the character. (Lovitz, for example, is now in charge of company insurance.)But after a very humorous and real documentary about the rising cookie chain, the film drops its co-characters and becomes a preachy morality tale about riches, with the primary message being that you should always be yourself no matter what, and that riches don't equal happiness. How many times has that been done?Frenchy falls for a suave Englishman living in New York named David (Hugh Grant), a guy whose taste in the fine things of life shines through. Frenchy is inspired She considers David a mentor, following him around and trying to improve her vocabulary. (She memorizes the dictionary. I'm almost through 'A' now!)Ray isn't so happy with his new life. He pines to be rid of his riches, to be able to pull some more heists. He smells a skunk when he sniffs near David and rightfully so; David is trying to milk them of their money. When the company crashes and burns in bankruptcy, David insults Frenchy. (She says, I asked for a lesson in life. I guess I got one.)But that's the problem. Morality is a great underplay in films, but it takes over in Small Time Crooks. When that previously mentioned documentary ends all hearty laughs turn into chuckles. After Ray breaks up with Frenchy to go back to his old career all chuckles turn into grins. Soon the grins are gone, too.I loved the first forty minutes of Small Time Crooks, and the film has a nice message at its core, but its flaws take over in the second act. Sticking with the bank heist is ample material to stretch out for a full-length feature film; by entirely switching courses Allen just makes his film a mess. The joy of the premise and lovable characters are all forgotten. What happened to Lovitz and the rest of his crew after the company crashed? The film doesn't bother to tell us.And that, I am afraid, is this film's primary problem. Besides, the big message is Be Yourself. The film ends with Ray resorting to robbery again and Frenchy resorting to being nothing at all. With the way people are suing over crazy things like hot coffee at McDonald's in today's age, I'm surprised nobody's tried to sue Woody Allen. I can see it now He told me to be myself! Allen didn't count on the fact that perhaps being yourself means being a homicidal loony, did he?Small Time Crooks is rated PG for some language and brief innuendo. It would be suitable for families.

Recently I saw `Sweet and Lowdown' and think it one of the most multidimensionally complex, introspective films I've ever seen. I also saw `Crimes and Misdemeanors,' and thought he was working with ideas too big for his skills. Rather like the character Woody plays in this film. In fact `Sweet' was successful because the actor (Sean Penn) was able to convey a Woody that had some natural skill, who in his heart knew he was secondrate, and who also had publicly criticized eccentricities. Penn could convey that Woody. Woody could never, and that's the root of the problem with this film.There're two types of New Yorkers. Those with class and those without, regardless of fame and wealth. Woody pokes fun at himself here for his own benefit. But for us viewers, there's not much here, and except for a few skits, there are few laughs.But chances are that if you are reading this, you're going to or have seen this anyway. If so, isn't May a gas? She's one of those aristocrats of comedy, and there's a double joke here. She plays the dimmest wit, though in real life, she would be the top cookie. And she had a meteoric rise in Hollywood until writing/directing `Ishtar' with two of the then biggest stars. It was the biggest flop in history until `Waterworld,' and even then WW made money. Having her in this fable of up/down and having her steal every scene is so sweet.

It is an amusing rags-to-riches-to-rags story that carries with it the subtle message that the acquisition of wealth doesn't automatically confer class and that class isn't necessarily desirable anyway.Allen sticks to slapstick themes in this story about a hapless couple that accidentally creates a mega-corporation out of a cookie store that is intended to be a front for a bank robbery.  Ray Winkler is a small time crook who rents the store because it is two doors down from the bank.  He intends to tunnel under the store and emerge in the bank vault while his wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman) bakes cookies in the store above to avert suspicion.  Of course, the heist is botched, but the cookie store has lines around the block and goes national.With one outrageous skit after another, Allen examines the difference between class and wealth, as Ray and Frenchy try to fit into high society.  Ultimately, success becomes the Winkler's worst enemy as money buys them only misery.Allen applies his trademark manic-depressive portrayal this time to a crook that has big ideas ricocheting around a very empty skull.  Allen has perfected the tortured-soul routine, which I suspect is a persona not very far its performer's true self.  Tracey Ullman delivers an outstanding performance as Frenchy, trying desperately to pull off a societal con and remake herself into a modern Pygmalion.  Ullman offers a great portrayal of a woman who is street smart but na√Øve about aristocratic ways.  She handles the emotional conflict superbly as she spurns Ray for not wanting to become what Frenchy herself, despite all her efforts, can never be.  Elaine May is also priceless as Frenchy's vacuous sister whose mindless chatter is often filled with pointed insight.There is much to enjoy about this straightforward comedy about simple people in extraordinary circumstances.  It is slapstick with a message, which makes it both funny and mentally appealing.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is light fare, but very entertaining.

He never draws attention to the camera or any of the technical workings of a movie. He's like a goalie for his actors and at a lot of the time, he likes to join in, like in this one. This is factually one of his most light-hearted movies. It's more like an outing than a movie. However it's not so much a dull little romp. Rather it's a testament to Woody's genius Whereas most directors take years off and often come back having lost the heat to their touch, this is Woody's way of taking a break.Woody, Tracey Ullman and Elaine May give some of the most fully developed comic performances I've seen in a long time. You feel a lot of warmth for May's decidedly stupid but innocent character and the exact opposite for Woody's exceedingly bumbling and constantly incompatible crook and grumpy old married guy. Ullman highlights the film as Woody's unexpectedly spotlit wife, who handles the better chunk of screen time and delivers dune-dry lines and faces.What's most endearing about Small Time Crooks is that its main thread is that of a crime film about bank robbery, impostorship, heartless sweetheart scamming, and bungling larceny, however one never feels the malice of such elements because it plays out as a romantic comedy about the marital spat between Allen and Ullman and Woody's growing friendship with May.Anyway, it's almost pathologically averse to being anything about which to be enthusiastic. It may have simply been intended to be nothing more than a cozy little comedy of otherwise minor consequence. If so, it succeeds. "},{"Title":"Shock horror!

If questions the very nature of happiness, I would dare say.It makes me think of Plato's myth of the cave, with people watching shadows on the wall of the cave and one who is awakened by going outside and realizing there is much more out there, and the shadows are all just illusions. However, are these characters the people in the cave, or the enlightened ones? Perhaps the wealthy, greedy ones such as Hugh Grant's character are also stuck in the cave, allured by the illusions of wealth, art and the like. What is truth? What is the nature of truth? Small Time Crooks, despite it's modest story, dares to question these things and entertain at the same time, which every great film should aspire to do. Honest inquiry into the nature of things and entertainment all lumped together.

Since then he's been an icon in the world of screen comedy with many hits and even went on to critical acclaim with his Bergman-inspired dramatic works as well.   But in the past five years or so his track record has been erratic.  He scored last year with Sean Penn in `Sweet and Lowdown' but in his latest attempt in rekindling the bumbling spirit of his novice opus he seems to be losing his touch.Allen stars as Ray Winkler,  a former crook whose lowly existence as a dishwasher only prompts his low-life tendencies to fuel his desire for a get rich quick scheme by masterminding a bank job with the aid of a decidedly motley crew while his long-suffering ex-stripper wife Frenchy (Ullman in a patented pitch-perfect Noo Yawker turn) acts as a front baking cookies in a store they use to avoid any suspicion.  Which of course quickly escalates into new acts of idiocy with Ray's three conspirators the dimwitted Denny (Rapaport in one of his endearing dumb-guy modes) who prefers wearing his miner's helmet backward while tunneling; Tommy (Darrow best known for his mobbed up eatery owner/whipping boy by Joe Pesci in `GoodFellas') who doesn't trust anyone; and Benny (Lovitz) an arsonist whose career helped put two kids through school. When the heist fails miserably after several incredibly stupid moves by the quartet, the cookie-making Frenchy suddenly becomes a smash with the locals leading to a fast-forward year later as a baking franchise goldmine and the Winklers as vulgar nouveau riche schnooks trying to better themselves.  Frenchy wants so desperately to be of the hoi polloi that she enlists an erudite art dealer (Grant clearly relishing his poke at his own effete celebrity) who has a few cards up his sleeve in deigning to bilk the unsuspecting millionaires for as much as he can. The film of itself has some sporadic laughs largely due to the first twenty minutes of the bungled caper and to the able support by May as Ullman's addle-brained cousin (coincidentally named May) who manages to talk like a sieve without thinking for a minute of what she's actually saying.  But the story is a one-note joke on just how ridiculous the Winklers are, ugly cartoons if you will, about how they enjoy (or rather lack of joy) their wealth.  Ray would rather watch a ball game with a greasy cheeseburger than mix it up with the power elite of Manhattan (in fact the whole air of the movie feels like a second rate Three Stooges two-reeler!) Hopefully Allen (who makes no bones about his frequent output of films, averaging it seems every six months one is on the horizon) will get back on track and not seem so nostalgic for a change to find some fresher ways of making us laugh.  He could always do a sequel with Virgil Starkwell getting mixed up with a Quentin Tarantino hood; then again maybe not.

But, like 'Danny', its gag- and plot-driven surface does not preclude thematic depth.  It's a relief to see a Woody film starring Woody that isn't obsessed with sexual anguish, that harks back to those earlier, legendary, 'funnier' films, when jokes weren't necessarily tied down to psychological plausibility, didn't need to be true, and so could spring from anywhere.  Some of the funniest bits aren't even verbal; lovely physical moments that some directors might have cut, such as the reaction of the actors to the spurting drain they've hacked, as the line between character and actor blurs, and we see some amiable, middle-aged men trying to contain their bemused laughter at this probably only-take phenomenon.That's not to say there aren't verbal gems either.  But this time, rather than simply give audience pleasure (which they do), they also, somewhat maliciously, turn against us.  Some commentators have noticed the film's quiet subversion, its equation of capitalism with theft (did I really see a restaurant called 'Tout Va Bien'?!) this saves the film from its old-fashioned conservatism, the idea that people shouldn't try to be what they're not, should stay as they are, which is very convenient for some people.  The film pits the deeply unpleasant, amoral, snobbish parasites against the amusing, amoral nouveau riche.  This conflict is expressed in strange ethical terms, even though neither camp has any morality whatsoever.  Maybe it's because the Winklers are gaudily open about their amorality, maybe it's because they're 'working class' (or Woody's version of that elusive concept), maybe it's because it's Woody and Tracey, and in any Hollywood film the English character is going to come out looking like the villain. The point is, narratively speaking we are on the Winklers' side, it's their rise and fall, their personalities, tastes, eccentricities that shape the film.  But.  Many of these verbal jokes are on them.  The film could be seen as an attack on culture, the failure of culture, or, at best, the abuse of culture, its use, not as an expression of humanity through the creative imagination, but as a way of creating new, seemingly non-social hierarchies, of keeping people down, or out, an American equivalent of the 'Rich and Famous' programmes beloved of Frenchy.  But to get these jokes, you have to have culture, placing us on a 'superior' level of knowledge to the characters; in effect, taking us out of identification with the heroes, and putting us with the villains.  As the appreciation of a Woody Allen film depends on this kind of knowledge (and it's unlikely you'll find Ray or Frenchy at a Woody Allen film), you realise how pessimistic, even sour, the film actually is.Yet also rather sweet.  There is a beautiful scene near the beginning, when Frenchy finally gives in to Ray's crazy felonious plans.  On their balcony, they watch a gorgeous, Fei Zhao-photographed sunset over New Jersey, remembering their youth.  They even call the 'front' business that makes their millions 'Sunset Cookies'.  When we first see Ray, he is an old man in his 60s wearing shorts.  When he goes home, the house is full of toys, teddies, pictures of clowns etc.  As if answering all the critics (not another Woody film where he's chasing teenage skirt!), this is a wonderful film about accepting old age.  Ray hangs around with friends half his age; his plans are attempts to capture his youth - his time in jail has prevented him from ever experiencing adult life.  By the end, his only desire is to go to Florida, famed final resting place of the American aged.  His scenes with Elaine May (why hasn't he worked with this genius before?  All those Mia Farrow films!), another lost soul searching for company, therefore have a rich poignancy (in this context, his pitting himself against Hugh Grant, another famed transgressor, is inspired).  You would have to see this anyway just for Woody's blinding suits.

It's apparent that many people just...to put simply...HATE HIM! Whenever they hear Allen has come out with a new film they almost immediately dismiss it as another annoying typical,self indulgent film. As I've been reading what costumers have to say about not only this film but Allen's other recent films (Deconstructing Harry,Celebrity,Sweet and Lowdown) it seems no matter what Allen does there's ALWAYS someone out there who has something bad to say about his films. Either,his films are too depressing,why doesn't he stop complaining! As in the case of Another Women, Stardust Memories, Deconstructing Harry, and Crimes and Misdemeanors. Or his films aren't depressing enough! Why doesn't he go back to making films like Another Women, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Stardust Memories, instead of making fun movies like Everyone Says I Love You, Sweet and Lowdown, and this movie. When Allen tries to give the public what they want,they change their minds! It's almost funny reading what people have to say about his films. I know I always can't stop laughing at them. One minute it's make more movies like Take the Money and Run, and the next minute it's make more movies like Hannah and Her Sisters.

She's quite funny as well. She definitely keeps up with Allen,as far as one liners are concerned. I wasn't too crazy about Hugh Grant in the movie.

However the wealth they always craved comes with unexpected prices.Held up as some sort of return to form for Woody Allen, this film seems to have a better reputation than it deserves simply because it is quite light and witty at times.  However to say that this film represents some sort of return to form for Woody Allen is doing him a great disservice.  The plot starts out as some sort of caper but, after the first third, starts to spin off into a slightly rambling message about the joys of the simple life.  That is not to say that the majority of the film is not amusing (as it is) but it lacks a good enough structure to support the very light material.Allen's dialogue is pretty amusing but doesn't really amount to much.  The exaggerated caper and good fortune affairs in the first half is much stronger than the latter half simply because the end needs to deliver and it doesn't really manage it.  The cast are all pretty good and their performances match the light material.  Allen is OK and is well matched by Tracey Ullman.  Support from Rapaport, Darrow, Lovitz and Grant is all pretty good but it is obvious that everyone has just been told to try and keep things nice and light and frothy.Overall I enjoyed the first half of the film simply because I like Allen's style of humour and found it to be witty and not really lacking.  However the second half of the film became a little directionless and seemed to be pointing to a moral without actually keeping a grip on the plot at the same time.

His latest movie Small Time Crooks serves well as a case study in filmmaker lethargy.  Not only is this the unfunniest, most mind-numbingly boring film Allen has ever made, but it is also so half-baked in almost every aspect of its production that I'm certain it will be one of the worst films of the year.Small Time Crooks, as most people who have seen the film have correctly noted, is intended to be viewed as a trivial comedy.  Allen has not made a film like this in a long time; after his monumental Annie Hall (which, for the record, is on my all-time top ten list), Allen's films ventured into more cerebral comedy while often confronting large, existential themes. While I far prefer his later work both for its superior ambitions and more sophisticated and just plain funnier comedy, Allen's early work has its well-reasoning defenders.  Sleeper, Bananas, and Take the Money and Run were all zany, well-executed comedies that, if lacking in intellectual content or real wit, at least delivered the goods - good slapstick, original sight gags and those wonderfully incisive one-liners.In Small Time Crooks Allen's screenplay traps him and renders him powerless in utilizing his comic arsenal.  His character is written to be too stupid to be witty, and as a result he never capatilizes on any of the many comic opportunities.  When the Allen character arrives home to find his culture-seeking wife has purchaced an obviously hideous piece of modern art, Allen, as usual, stammers and wrings his hands. As the neurotic fiddling builds to a crescendo, we in the audience anticipate the put-down.  It never comes he stupidly turns away and says he'll never look at the wall with the painting on it, in more or less those words.  That same disappointment comes time after time.I suppose that Woody's wife (the extraordinarily gifted Tracey Ullman) is supposed to act as sort of a foil to him, but she too is written to be a boob and the few witticisms she is given are wasted in the film's first five minutes.  Throughout the rest of the movie she's involved in a painfully predictible plot as the rich cookie company owner whose fortune attracts Hugh Grant, who attempts to romance her out of it.  Now Hugh Grant, in all his films, has the kind of charming screen presence that makes you wish you were his grandmother so you could reach across the screen and lovingly pinch him.  Here as a smarmy art dealer out for Tracey Ullman's money he's so devastatingly sweet that we actually believe he is falling in love with her and not scheeming his way into her checkbook.  It's all wrong.The whole story meanders in a way that reminds me of amateur improv miraculously sustained on life support.  Episodes idiotically and tangentially succeed each other with no logic, and in the process Jon Lovitz, Michael Rappaport, and Douglas McGrath end up marooned in the film's first reel.  In most movies, knowing that these three talented character actors never come back would be heartbreaking.  In this movie it's a mercy killing since they were never given anything funny to work with in the first place.Why are none of the characters intelligently written?  Because writing smart characters and smart dialougue requires a great deal more effort than Allen has put into this bombshell.  The lines themselves are limp and lifeless - most of them just have the actors repeating what their scene partners said before them - and the performances are similarly devoid of any energy. Remember in Take the Money and Run and the other early films how hyper and utterly spastic the Woody Allen character was and how happy he was to be on camera?  In Small Time Crooks the comic vitality that this material requires isn't there.  It's fortunate that even the slapstick was minimal given this energy drain.  Unusually choppy editing (for a Woody Allen movie - he usually gives us long, continuously shot scenes with much more interesting and rapid wordplay) at times seems to be covering up for the director's laziness and ineptitude. Even the music selection, which Allen can normally pride himself on, here seems carelessly done. I remember at least one tune that played about six times that in any other movie of Allen's would have been replaced by six other livelier and more appropriate pieces.Small Time Crooks is so thoughtlessly made in its vexing build-ups that never deliver, its obviously hasty casting, its totally incoherent plot, its soggy dialogue, and its off-target performances that I refuse to believe that this film was made in more time than the lifespan of a titsi fly. This is not the same Woody Allen that gave us Hannah and Her Sisters or even the same Woody who gave us Sleeper.  Give a ten year old with attention deficit disorder a camera crew, an all-star cast, and a Polish joke he overheard at Thanksgiving dinner and Small Time Crooks is what you get.

The bank robbery fails, naturally, but to everyone's surprise the cookie shop is a huge hit. Soon it has exploded into a multinational corporation and Ray and his accomplices are rich.Comments Allen seems tom focus most of his movie around one central theme, relationships. In my opinion he does two variants of that. The first being a comedy and the second being a movie where Allen tries to teach about life. The first kind I actually like, Allen has a special tone in his comedies that is rare and typical for Allen. The other kind is just boring and mostly pretentious. So from my perspective, any Allen movie is a gamble.Small Time Crooks has a great set up. Some loser thieves try for the big score. Perfect for a comedy where the bad crooks can make mistake after mistake and get further and further in over their heads. That movie I hoped for and would have liked to see. Unfortunately just about 20 minutes into the movie we switch to the other type of Allen-movie. The life lesson.Suddenly the cookie franchise is a huge hit and everyone becomes rich the legal way. Ray's equally bad crook friends, those with some interesting character played by Rapaport and Lovitz, disappear and are replaced by flat and mostly boring aristocrats, most notably played by Grant. The comedy disappears and (for me) destroys the movie as quickly as a cave-in in the tunnel would have destroyed their robbery plans.In the second and major part of the movie, Allen and Ullman, runs around trying to act as rich they are but failing in their relationships. The message that is basically spelled out in large print, and the only thought behind the last 70 minutes, is Money can't buy happiness. Thank you Allen, I would never have guessed that by myself.So, for me, the movie is disappointing. I gambled and lost.

Firstly he was a very funny stand-up comedian.  Then he started to make some very funny, but also very silly, films.  The he got serious, making proper comedies that caused him to be praised as a great film-maker.  This lead him to get completely serious, with interesting works that bombed at the box office.  More recently, he's made more comedies, although even his biggest fans say they're not as good as what he produced during his late 70s peak.My take on this is that the really best Woody Allen films are the very very earliest - 'Sleeper', for example, I love.  But even by the time of his most acclaimed movies, to me he was already past his best.  Allen's early comic persona was like a modern, Jewish equivalent of Chaplain's tramp.  To take essentially the same persona and cast him as a romantic lead in anything an audience is expected to take at least semi-seriously is absurd; no-one like Woody Allen (except, of course, the famous Mr. Allen himself) would find himself with the galaxy of attractive sexual opportunity that he has presented his character with in over three decades of film-making.  In farce, this doesn't matter. In anything else, it grates really badly.  And even other aspects of this act grow weary through repetition (in this sense, his darkest films, where he tried to lose sight of his past altogether, were at least a step in the right direction, even if they weren't actually very good).  These days, I start to watch a Woody Allen film only with dread, expecting nothing but a self-referential, self-important, over-familiar story of relationships among the wealthy of New York.So, what a delight is 'Small Town Crooks', a straight farce like he used to give us, very silly, very funny, full of great gags.  There's no attempt to sell us an especially coherent plot, but there are a lot of laughs, many to do with being nouveau riche and being stupid (some of the material would work in 'Only Fools and Horses').

After watching films like Annie Hall and Take the Money and Run I still say this is his funniest film up to date!The plot is simple and never wears thin.  This could've went straight to one-joke boredom, but it had something new to offer in every act.  The whole bank robbery attempt was only the first act.  The second act deals with some hilarious fish-out-of-water, rags-to-riches comedy after the two low-class New Yorkers--Woody and Tracey Ullman who is absolutely terrific and was robbed of an Oscar--move on up--but not to the East Side...LOL.  Watching Woody trying disastrously to adapt to the yuppy lifestyle is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on film.  In one scene, he's being interviewed and he's trying to describe an antique piece of furniture to the reporter  This belonged to Louie the Fourteenth--or Louie the Fifteenth.  I don't know, how high do the Louies go?  He's the Top Louie.  Woody and Ullman have an unbelievable chemistry as the dueling couple.  I hope to see them again in an upcoming movie, they are absolutely incredible. Some people don't understand Woody's brand of humor, but his style of delivering sarcastic dialogue in this movie makes me crack up so hard!  In the opening scene, he returns to his apartment and Ullman asks Who's there?  He replies, Who--who is it?  It's the Pope!  I always wanted to see what your house looked like!  If any other actor were to say those lines, I would not laugh, but Woody has this magic delivery that never ceases to please.  There's many other hints of Woody's sarcasm used frequently throughout the film.  This comedy is full of memorable moments that I can just think back to and a smile will stretch across my face.  It would be sin to give those jokes away to those who have yet to see this movie, so I will not get into them.  Just see for yourself!With the explosion of gross-out comedies, I guess you can say a movie like this is a blessing in disguise.  There's no cheap, low-brow shots here.  Nothing but good, intelligent, original, old-fashioned, sarcastic comedy that pokes fun at both the upper and lower class, in a way only Woody can pull it off.  There's also some noteworthy supporting performers.  I have to mention Elaine May, who plays the airhead character with pure excellence.  I admit that I've grown tired of the airhead characters I see in comedies--especially the dumb blondes--but she portrays the characters with a certain sense of wit and energy, and has some really funny lines. What more can I say about this movie?  It's a comedy that's both amiable and funny, none of the cynical humor people have grown accustomed to.  This would've been a normal comedy back in the 1950s, but now if you make a film that doesn't contain a single flatulence or sexual gag--that's like breaking the comic barrier.  Not jumping on the bandwagon with the rest of the comedy writers.  While the Farrelly Brothers are whisked away on this wagon, Woody stands on his own and makes this uproariously funny, original comedy!  A film I will always remember as an underrated classic!  This is what comedy is all about!My score  10 (out of 10)       "},{"Title":"Is it supposed to make you laugh?","Date":"11 January 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  OK, I've only seen two films in 2001 yet(the other one being the excellent WONDER BOYS), but this one is surely going to be one of the worst in theatrical release this year. I went in not expecting too much of it. It wasn't even my idea to see this film, but I thought Hey, what the heck....  There were only a few people in the theater, two left during the show. I think that says it all, but since I'm not the person to walk out of a theater in the middle of a film, I actually sat through the entire thing. The premise is silly to say the least, but it actually gets even sillier and sillier as it goes along! I think Woody's aim here was to make some sort of screwball comedy, but his comic timing is so bad and the actors (Allen himself, Tracey Ullman and Hugh Grant) are so irritating and boring that it simply doesn't work. The story is pretty thin, but could've worked if it was done properly. Best moments involve May and there's a scene in which Ullman and Grant are watching a modern play and that's quite hilarious, though it's not really a joke. But I think this could've been something as a comment on the new upper class people and their habits and good/bad taste. Woody however doesn't seem very interested in doing so. Thus the result is pretty excruciating to watch. One advice avoid it at all costs! I can't believe I just gave this 4/10, but so be it.

But when the cookie shop takes off, the plot dive bombs in BIG style.The film's plot leaps from pillar to post, the humour becomes toe-curlingly bad and the stereotypes are run out for another tired lap of the park.Dreadful. Didn't make it to the end of the film it was so awful - the washing up was more appertising than watching Woody Allen being inanely unfunny. "},{"Title":"Save yourself at least an hour of your life.

Nothing wrong with that, right?Here's the run-down. Three men and a woman plan to rob a bank. They buy a plot next to the bank and the lady opens a cookie shop as the front. Meanwhile, they're digging to the vault in the basement. Along the way, a security guard finds out, and decides to join them for the money.Here's where it gets odd.The cookies are selling really well, so they decide not to rob the bank after all and go into the cookie business and open factories all over America. Then the woman starts falling for some guy, which her husband does not like, and it becomes a romance story! It's as the movie is suffering from genre-confusion disorder and can't decide what it wants to be about!Bottom line- Avoid unless you happen to enjoy bad movies.

Shamelessy plundering the Hollywood vaults he cobbles some familiar enough plot lines into a competent comedy that should ensure he will never be poor,but then it is looking increasingly unlikely that he will ever reach the heights his early work promised.He should care,of course. From an angst - ridden intellectual he switches to an angst - ridden anti - intellectual as Winkler a hugely unsuccessful little league felon whose plan to rob a bank using a cookie shop as a beard goes somewhat agley. His wife and her sister make a huge success of the business and they all become mega - rich. Winkler is happy to remain a nerd but his wife wishes to spread her intellectual wings and takes on a mentor from the Art World. They go bust and their erstwhile friends turn their backs on them. I think I can see a point being made here. Miss T Ullman plays Winkler's wife as Barbra Streisand which is fine for 10 minutes but a tad wearing as the movie progresses.Elaine May is the best thing on view as her nice but dim sister.Mr H.Grant once again hardly stretches himself as an upper middle class Brit cast adrift amongst the Philistines. The more uncharitable might find the phrase potboiler comes to mind.

Neurotic stumbling is all well and good for a young man; but to watch a character in his 60s showing the kind of character failings that he should have worked through in his 20s is slightly perverse!Woody plays, well, Woody. If you've seen any of his films then you'll get the picture; and if you've seen Love and Death or Manhattan then you'll just feel annoyed that Woody appears to be doing the same routine 20 years later. That joke isn't funny anymore!Anyway, maybe it's only the first 15 minutes that are bad... anybody who manages to watch for longer than that, please email and let me know how it all turns out! 4/10.

The humor is nonexistent--the attempts are barely even visible. The plot is lame, the script is boring, the characters are unimaginative, and it's drawn out for far too long. Perhaps the worst point, though, is that there's NO SCORE--just some sampled 40s-sounding excerpt played over and over again in different places in the film. Single worst movie I've ever seen.Save yourself the time and money--don't even bother with this movie. I've never really liked Woody Allen's stuff to begin with, but this is the lowest of the low. "}]
