So he decides to pick up his brother first. During a pit stop, Fuller has a mechanic install a CB radio. They joke around with truckers, going so far as posing as a woman and setting up a false date with one. When the prank turns to tragedy, the trucker seeks revenge.For the most part, Joy Ride is an enjoyable horror/thriller. It is loaded with tension and it's easy for viewers to picture themselves in the scenario, as it's relatively realistic. The horror is formed from everyday situations, where just a couple bad decisions can lead one into the sights of a madman.However, I had to subtract two points for something I very rarely subtract points for--stupid decisions on the part of protagonists. Of course, some people think that horror films are primarily based on characters making stupid decisions, but in my view of the genre, even if such actions are clichéd, filmmakers generally justify such decisions at least in the context of the film. Too often in Joy Ride, writers Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams, along with director John Dahl, make little attempt at justification. Why don't they just turn the CB off? Why don't they just ignore the villain? Why don't they call the police? Why don't they stay in places that are more populated (like the truckstop)? Why do they keep trusting the villain? While there are some cursory answers to a few of these questions, taken together, you keep wondering, In the film's world, how can someone so stupid be in college? One possible answer is suggested by the Joy Ride DVD. It contains a 29-minute alternate ending that thankfully has a bit of commentary from both the director and the writer. The alternate ending is just is good as the theatrical version, in my opinion, and tries to put a slightly more logical spin on the film. Our heroes do end up at a police station, with some police cooperation. However, it was apparently felt that this alternate (actually the original) ending didn't work and didn't maintain tension. Abrams felt that involving the police more directly in the plot removed too much of the focus from our heroes. Dahl also states that he thought there was too much character development in the original ending. I beg to differ on all of those points. Although the revised ending has many positive aspects not found in the original--especially a Rube Goldberg-like scenario involving maximum, immediate risk and creating maximum tension, the original ending may have worked better overall in my opinion.But Joy Ride is good enough overall to transcend stupid decisions on the part of the characters. If seen as a sequence of high-tension scenarios, where logical plot connectors are only secondary to creating thrilling rides, Joy Ride almost deserves an A (a 9 in my rating system). There isn't a scenario in the film that's not smart and inventive in some way. The three principles--Walker, Zahn and Sobieski--give good performances, and the villain is masterfully done by Matthew Kimbrough (who provided the body), Ted Levine (who provided the bizarre, creepy voice), and Dahl, who wisely shows glimpses of him, but only glimpses. The villain is almost supernatural in his cleverness, strength and obsession. It's just too bad that we haven't had a sequel yet. "},{"Title":"A surprisingly engrossing and effective thriller.  Not all that original but extremely entertaining.","Date":"13 January 2003","Score":"50 out of 59 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  It would be very easy to overlook 'Roadkill' (the title 'Joy Ride' is known by here in Australia), especially considering the leads are mainly known for asinine teen movies. But dig a little deeper and you will see that it is directed by the underrated John Dahl, also responsible for the crackerjack thriller 'Red Rock West' a decade ago. Paul Walker ('The Skulls') is very effective as your average joe college kid, and Steve Zahn ('Out Of Sight') is even better as his smart ass older brother. Zahn is a talented comic often better than the movies he appears in, and he is in fine form here. The chemistry between the two is believable and amusing without becoming tired. Leelee Sobieski ('Eyes Wide Shut') has yet to make much of an impact on me, and there's very little to change that here. She is passable but little more than eye candy as Walker's potential love interest. The real star of the movie is the mysterious and frightening trucker Rusty Nail ('The Silence Of The Lambs' Ted Levine). Of course the whole scenario is hugely indebted to Spielberg's suspense classic 'Duel', but Dahl and co. manage to put a fresh and exiting spin on familiar material. 'Roadkill' won't change your life, but it is a genuinely exciting and effective thriller, a real rarity in Hollywood these days. Hitchcock it ain't but it's a very entertaining popcorn movie with plenty of thrills and twists. Recommended.

The film is about Lewis (Paul Walker), a college coed who decides to buy himself a car and take off across the desert to pick up a would-be-girlfriend, Venna (Leelee Sobieski) in Colorado for a road trip together. He then learns that his older troubled brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn) has been arrested in Salt Lake City, so he picks him up on the way. After having a CB radio installed into the car, the two take off to pick up Venna, but end up pulling a prank on an anonymous trucker who goes by the name of Rusty Nail (excellently voiced by Ted Levine) on the CB radio. After the trucker learns about the prank, he attacks the brothers with his large semi, but they manage to escape. But soon after they pick up Venna, the menacing truck driver begins harassing them again, seeking revenge for the joke they decided to play on him - he'll stop at nothing to get it, and he's looking for more than an apology.Reminiscent of The Hitcher in quite a few ways, but also a much different film, Joy Ride was a surprise for me. I was expecting something along the lines of your typical teenage-horror fare, and I was pleasantly surprised with this intelligent and heart-pounding little thriller of a film. To start off, the story in itself is very nicely written and manages to avoid clichés. The characters in this film are smart, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way through. There are some excellently orchestrated thrill sequences, one of them being the really intense chase through the cornfield, among others, and these scenes are sure to get you on the edge of your seat.Tension builds slowly during the first 40 minutes or so, and from there it just goes rampant. The cast is led by Paul Walker, who hasn't accomplished anything too amazing, but manages to lead the film well and play his character believably. Steve Zahn in his quirky and funny older brother, and plays the part suitably. Leelee Sobieski plays the intuitive girl-next-door friend who ends up along for the ride, and she also gives a worthy performance. The psycho-trucker villain of the film is very scary, never really seen - we get to know him through the frightening conversations on the CB radio, where he makes numerous threats and has many disturbing confrontations with the group of friends. Ted Levine, who played the notorious Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs voices the psychopath, and his voice itself is creepy enough, and adds to the villain's overall demeanor. The ending was excellent, and I loved how ominous it was. I really didn't see it coming, and it concluded on a very unnerving note.Overall, Joy Ride is a superior action-filled horror/thriller that came as a big surprise to me. It was intelligent, tense, scary, and very well-written, which was nice because of my semi-low (no pun intended) expectations going into it. People who enjoyed The Hitcher will more than likely also enjoy this road trip from hell. Very well done and worth seeing for both horror and thriller fans alike. 8/10.

Director John Dahl of Unforgettable (1996) and Rounders (1998) conjures up several convincing but unsavory clammy-fisted suspense scenes in this low-budget, neo-noir, cat-and-mouse road rage thriller, but he cheats audiences over the long run. First, he affords us only fleeting glimpses of the villain. Never do we clearly see what this homicidal hellion looks like any more than we saw the Blair Witch herself. Of course, when the DVD version comes out, we'll freeze-frame that split-second shot of this mother trucker for clarity, but until then the only prominent feature is a greasy fat paw of a fist. Second, Dahl does little to make the Clay Tarver & Jeffrey Abrams screenplay appear remotely plausible. Not only does the anonymous but omniscient villain in Joy Ride manage to stay well ahead of our protagonists, but also he accomplishes some pretty outrageous feats. Third, since our heroes cannot vanquish evil, Dahl deprives us of the emotional catharsis that closure would have provided. Instead, the open-and-unresolved ending, perfect for a sequel, robs Joy Ride of memorable dramatic impact. Fourth, for a movie about a deranged dastard, the corpses are too far and few between in number. Only two people out of everybody else in the entire film die. BOO! Sadly, my high hopes for this persuasively acted but uneven suspenser grew out of previously impressive Dahl directoral outings such as the edgy Red Rock West (1993) with Nicholas Cage and the mischievous femme fatale opus The Last Seduction (1994) with sexy Linda Fiorentino.Essentially, freshman scribe Clay Tarver and Jeffrey Abrams of Armageddon and Forever Young have penned a shallow but provocative screenplay long on suspense but short on payoff. They borrow elements from Steven Spielberg's 1971 telefilm Duel, the 1997 Jonathan Mostow nail-biter Breakdown with Kurt Russell, and the grisly yet gripping 1986 Robert Harmon stalker saga The Hitcher co-starring Rutger Hauer & C. Thomas Howell. Watch any of those movies, and you'll be far ahead of this formulaic fare. Each movie exerts an influence on Joy Ride, but Dahl cannot sustain this tightly coiled thriller despite its top-grade technical qualities. Even his clever homage to Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest with a nighttime cornfield scene doesn't compensate for the routine storyline. Basically, a psychotic trucker (effectively voiced by Matthew Kimbrough) with neither a shred of humor nor decency harasses brothers Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker of Skulls) and Fuller Thomas (Steve Zahn of Out of Sight) to the point of trying to butcher them. After our misguided protagonists play a juvenile prank with their citizen's band radio on a creepy, hormone-addled trucker, 'Rusty Nail' as the trucker calls himself goes insanely berserk.Whoa, let's back up momentarily. Initially, Lewis had an airline ticket for his flight home as his freshman year winds down at the University of California at Berkley As the action gears up, Lewis is chatting long-distance with an old hometown friend Venna (Leelee Sobrieki of The Glass House) who has just broken up with her boyfriend at the University of Colorado at Boulder. She explains how she'd like to decompress and gradually make her way home. Wouldn't it be fantastic, she muses aloud, if Lewis could pick her up in his car. She doesn't think Lewis owns a car. Indeed, our hero doesn't until she puts the idea in his brain. Lewis lies and assures her he has a car, and they make plans for him to pick her up. Out goes Lewis to cash in his airline ticket and buy a used car, so Venna and he can take the slow way home to New Jersey like the heroes did in Jeepers Creepers. Before he embarks on his road trip, Lewis learns from his mom that the Salt Lake City Police have arrested his irresponsible older brother Fuller on a DUI charge. Somebody must bail him out, and his father refuses to do anything about him. Along the way to Boulder, Lewis impulsively makes a U-turn that gets him a ticket then wheels into Salt Lake City long enough to secure Fuller's release. The last thing Lewis imagined is Fuller would choose to accompany Venna and him on the entire trip. Clearly, Fuller must have forgotten the cliché Two's A Group; Three's A Crowd. Director John Dahl botches what otherwise might have ranked as a top-flight horror feature. Again, he never reveals the villain, charts an improbable chronicle of events, drums up an unbelievable ending, has a low body count, and lets evil escape punishment. The sad thing about Joy Ride' and so many movies today is the technical qualities are superb. The acting is first-rate. Steve Zahn and Pat Walker make believable brothers, especially in their sibling rivalry scenes. Meanwhile, Zahn brings incredible nuance to his character. Rednecks take a beating in the script, and Dahl depicts them as Neanderthal types who lack sexual savoir faire. Unfortunately, neither Dahl nor his scenarists bring any psychological insight into Rusty Nail's character. When Lewis addresses Rusty Nail in his Candy Cane voice, Rusty hesitates when Candy asks him what he would do after she unbuttoned her blouse. The guys get a great laugh out of Rusty's sexual repressive personality. Later, they pay for their arrogance when Rusty Nail forces them to enter a truck stop butt-naked to order six cheeseburgers. The expression on the elderly waitress's face when she asks if they want fries to go with it is hilarious. Joy Ride gets a lot of mileage out of suspense, but director John Dahl turns it into road kill.

Best of all, it's a very scary movie due to the realistic nature of the plot.Lewis (Paul Walker) embarks on a cross country ride in a car he just purchased to pick up his friend Venna (Leelee Sobieski) for a scheduled college vacation period. along the way, a brief scuffle with a sheriff brings him face to face with his brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) who he hasn't seen in several years. He decides to give him brother a ride to Colorado, but along they way they pick up a CB radio to track the whereabouts of police officers to make better time. In what turns out to be an ill-fated idea, they play a practical joke on a trucker who's handle is Rusty Nail. Needless to say, one prank and a missing jaw later the brothers find themselves in a race to save not only their own lives, but that of Venna as well.The concept of a deranged trucker is nothing new in cinema (see Duel), but the realism of the plot makes for a very frightening film. The way Rusty Nail stalks the brothers is relentless, and he goes to great extremes to harass them. He even goes as far as to make them strip completely nude and order 12 cheeseburgers at a truck stop, or he would kill Venna's friend Charlotte whom he kidnapped.The main argument I have against this film is the relative ease in which Rusty Nail not only finds out the brothers were responsible for the pranks, but how he continues to find them along an interstate road. I suspect that he must have had some of his trucker buddies help him out along the way. With that said, for the most part the writing in this movie was superb. Steve Zahn does a remarkable job as Fuller, and you really think that he truly IS a moron. Walker and Sobieski are good in their roles as well. Id love to see Zahn and Walker team up in another film someday, as I felt they played well off one another here. Maybe Joyride 2? I'm giving Joyride an 8/10.

Leelee Sobieski isn't given much to do, sadly, but she is very pleasant to watch on the screen, and is a fine actress in her own right.  A bit more character development would have made her just as engaging as the two brothers.Dahl directs with considerable talent and style.  The action and suspense scenes are superb, but his quieter moments of romance, family matters, and humour are also handled very well.  We get to peek into the trio's minds and emotions, and come to like them and care about their fate.  When things get rough, the film is even more nerve-wracking because the bad stuff on the screen is happening to solid, real characters who we care about.  Let me tell you, the tension gets close to unbearable.  I was yelling at the screen - No!  Don't do it!  Don't open the door! and so on - which is something I rarely do.My advice to you is, if you like horror, action, and suspense, rush out and rent or buy this film immediately.  Don't watch the trailer, though, as it spoils some great moments.See it in a double feature with Jeepers Creepers, the other surprisingly good teen horror road movie of recent years.

Sometimes the movie doesn't know whether it wants to be a slick suspense-thriller or a slasher flick.  It's the film's unevenness that bogs it down.  Steve Zahn is good as usual, adding some fine comic relief.  Paul Walker is still not a great actor, but he's better than he was in The Fast and the Furious (I wanted to make sure he gets banned from movies forever after that performance).  And Leelee Sobieski shows off her talent as an up-and-coming young actress, sometimes to the point where I feel she's too good for this movie!  Joyride kept my interest, with the exception of a few overlong chase sequences, but it left me wanting more.  And there were some scenes that just begged for uninintentional laughter. ********SPOILERS AHEAD**********   For example, that scene where the guys stop at the gas station.  The tall, bearded guy with long hair (stereotypical creepy scary movie villain) walks into the store, carrying a tire thumper like a baseball bat.  The guys run into the car and try to make a quick getaway.  The creepy guy gets into his truck and chases after them.  When they finally stop, the guy steps up to the window and hands Paul Walker the credit card that he dropped at the store.  What the hell was that???  You're telling me a guy finds a credit card and he's gonna be such a good samaritan that he's gonna engage himself in a high-speed chase (driving a truck, I might add) just to give this poor guy his credit card? Joyride could've been a lot worse, but it could've been a lot better.  John Dahl, who directed the callously underrated Rounders, makes great use of lighting, but his slick direction can't overshadow the goofy script.

One character consistently has access to information (names, travel plans, room numbers) that simply is not available... which would be fine in a film about supernatural events. This is not a supernatural film. The film has that slick, smooth Hollywood feel that the independent film community cannot afford, and when the Indies use the cheap, digital cameras there is a grittiness, a sense of real urgency.

Well, Joy Ride surprises on almost every front and it's not like most other modern horror/thrillers, in which youngster play the main role. The genre that is being very popular this decade with movies such as Jeepers Creepers and remakes such as House of Wax. After seeing those movies, this movie really feels like a breath of fresh air.What makes Joy Ride so incredibly good and effective is the build-up of the tension. It's a sort of minimalistic movie, in terms of that it often doesn't show what is happening but rather imply things. It provides the movie with some typical 'edge-of-your-seat' kind of moments and also for most part makes this an unpredictable movie to watch, with plenty of good genre surprises in it.Even though this movie doesn't really have a monster or gore in it, it still can really be seen as an horror movie, not in the least thanks to it's wonderful build-up and overall atmosphere. John Dahl proofs himself once more to be a more than capable director.Yes, of course the movie shows plenty of similarities between other 'road-kill' movies such as Duel and The Hitcher so you can't really call this movie an original one. But nevertheless, the movie never feels like a bad rip-off that tries to cash in on the back's of other movies. The movie has plenty to offer on its own and certainly has enough quality to distinct itself from the average genre attempt, especially when compared to most other comparable genre movies from this decade.The story doesn't always flow too well and it often makes some sudden jumps. You can also say that in some parts not enough is happening but I think that this is all part of the build-up of the movie. The movie wants you to feel safe while watching and makes you feel at ease, until it then suddenly lets its action and tension kick in again, which makes it all the more effective of course.Seemed to me that Steve Zahn was thinking he was making a comedy at times. He of course is also mostly a comedy-actor, which might explain this. Perhaps it was also part of the director and build in as a sort of back-up. It was like they were thinking; hey, if the horror/tension of the movie doesn't work out, we can still turn it into a more comical/light less serious movie when needed. But I forgive them. It are not really the actors or characters that carry the movie, it's more a real movie that relies purely on its tension, atmosphere and surprises.Perfectly watchable and recommendable and way more than just another 'modern 00's-teenage-horror/thriller-flick'.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Great action movie!","Date":"5 November 2006","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I loved this movie and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!

Think about the hundreds of revenge films, like perhaps the Bronson flicks. The revenge setup is always that something incredibly horrible happens to set the stage. Then, we allow ourselves to feel no shame when incredible violence and usually supernatural luck or prowess is brought to bear.Then we had the pretty radical `Unforgiven,' where the revenge is purchased, and as things progress the original offense keeps getting amplified. Pretty strong, powerful and intelligent stuff.Now with this film, things are turned around. The revenge story is from the other side. As viewers, we never question that there really is a truck driver out there who fully justifies his actions the same way Bronson did.

Paul Walker ('The Skulls') is very effective as your average joe college kid, and Steve Zahn ('Out Of Sight') is even better as his smart ass older brother. Zahn is a talented comic often better than the movies he appears in, and he is in fine form here. The chemistry between the two is believable and amusing without becoming tired.

The real star of the movie is the mysterious and frightening trucker Rusty Nail ('The Silence Of The Lambs' Ted Levine). Of course the whole scenario is hugely indebted to Spielberg's suspense classic 'Duel', but Dahl and co. manage to put a fresh and exiting spin on familiar material.

(Nice campus, attractive little town. Several fine microbreweries but avoid the restaurants.) Walker is a discrete and normal young man. Zahn is normal too but a little on the zany side. On the CB radio, Zahn talks Walker into imitating a woman driver whose handle is Candy Cane. A truck driver with a deep Southern accent picks up on Candy Cane and her seductive invitation to a get-together at the Lone Star Motel -- Room 17. It's supposed to be just a joke. That room happens to be occupied by an obnoxious redneck the boys have just run into. The driver shows up with some pink champagne and enters Room 17, where an altercation follows, resulting in the legal occupant being beaten half to death, having his mandible ripped off, and being left on the highway median. The rest of the movie has the unknown driver of this monstrous truck following the two men and then, after they pick up Sobieski, the terrified trio all the way back from Colorado to Nebraska. There is a final confrontation in another motel, with an ambiguous ending that leaves the way open for a sequel, should this original work of art earn a nickel of profit.Actually, there's not too much blood, no sex, and only intermittent episodes of violence. And there's a good deal of tension generated.The tension is generated by the use of two plot devices.(1) The anonymous trucker, who is glimpsed only once and shown to be fat, huge, bald, and the color of a two-day old cadaver, has preternatural powers. At moments when the would-be victims are alone, he knows where they are and what they're doing. In an ocean of corn stalks, for example, far more vast than Cary Grant's in North by Northwest, and at NIGHT too, he's able to run them down and capture one of them. The guy sounds like a retard but he's unbeatable.(2) The plot requires that the trio of fugitives take advantage of every opportunity to commit a stupid act. There's nothing new about that. It takes an artist of Hitchcockian magnitude to do away with a victim who exhibits any normal grasp of his or her circumstances. (Psycho.) I won't even bother to give examples from the specimen now under examination. I will note that this is well-nourished and vividly displayed.

Deciding to get even, they contact Rusty & ask him (as Candy Caine of course) to show up with some pink champaign & stop off at room 17, where she is supposedly staying (it's the miserable customers room). The next day both boys discover that the miserable, racist man has been found alongside of the road, by local police, with his jaw literally torn from his body, leaving him in a deep coma hovering between life & death. Both boys are shaken over the incident & decide to get rid of the CB radio.

Things turn dealt serious when an innocent friend of Venna's is kidnapped & both boys are led into a terrifying series of dares & mind games that turn even more serious than the kidnapping of Venna's friend, when Rusty leads them into a deadly game of life or death.Despite it's somewhat torturous, nightmarish history, which included four alternate endings being shot after the original ending failed to satisfy studio heads (one of which was half an hour long!) four bumped release dates & numerous title changes (it was filmed under the title of SQUELCH) JOY RIDE by all accounts should have been a terrible movie, but thankfully it's not! in fact, the film is one of the best written thrillers to come out in many a year!Taking it's cue from Steven Spielberg's DUEL, JOY RIDE is a pure suspense thriller from beginning to end, never letting up for even a minute, there are numerous reasons for the films success, but what really works here is a tight knit script by script writers J.J. ABRAMS & CLAY TARVER which is one of the best most tight knit scripts ever written. But that's not all that makes this film work, the film is superbly acted & very well directed by film-maker JOHN DAHL, who delivers a series of really cool shots & really manages to crank up the suspense & tension to an almost unbearable & terrifying extremes & really soaks up the atmosphere & scenery of the Colorado landscapes & highways. The scene where the boys encounter an ice truck driver, who may or may not be Rusty, while stationed at a gas station getting gas, is a real edge of you're seat moment, as is when Rusty has both boys pinned against a tree, while they are in their own car, by constantly crushing his transport against it, pursing them throughout the cornfields in the dead of night, by chasing them down in his transport truck & the then luring the boys to one of the motel rooms, where he has the captured the very terrified heroine & tied her to a chair with a gun rigged to blow her head clean off, as soon as one of them goes to open the door & Fuller being trapped against a large fence with a transport heading straight for him, should get even the most seasoned of horror fan on the edge of their seat.All in all I highly recommend JOY RIDE to anyone who has not seen it, unlike most suspense thrillers, JOY RIDE never once loses it's footing & seemingly gets better as it ages, which is something a lot of films of it's ilk cannot say for itself.

Lights down low, volume up, attention focused. When you hear his voice come on over the CB communicator, see if you don't get the heebie-jeebies. What's even cooler is when you find out who plays him (though the films credits won't tell you, the trivia page here on IMDB will.... but check it after you see the movie!).

I heard about it when it first came out and I thought it sounded kinda interesting, but that it looked pretty typical and boring.  Surprisingly, it turned out to be pretty good.  The acting is good, for the most part; the plot, while not entirely original, held my attention; the atmosphere was great and very suspenseful.  The ending could've been better, but it was still pretty good.Up until now, the only Paul Walker movie I had ever seen was The Fast and the Furious.  While I do admit liking that movie (I know&#133; I know&#133;  What can I say?  My tastes are strange and they vary widely), I thought his character was pretty lame and so was the acting.  While his acting in this still isn't a hundred percent great and he does sorta sound like Keanu Reeves, there's still a marked improvement.  Steve Zahn is great.  He's goofy and kooky but at the same time can pull off some drama stuff, too.  He provides a lot of great comic relief.  Leelee Sobieski just looks, acts, and sounds like Helen Hunt.  I really didn't like her that much and thankfully she's not in the movie a whole lot.  Ted Levine, who played Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, voiced the psychotic truck driver and he's great for the part.  They guy just has a great, unique, eerie voice and he uses it for all it's worth in this flick.There've been more then a couple road trip thrillers made.  The Hitcher, Steven Spielberg's Duel (which I've never seen, but by looking at the plot, it's probably pretty similar to Joy Ride&#133; or Joy Ride is similar to Duel).  So the premise for Joy Ride isn't original, that's fine.  Few movies nowadays are.  The trick is to take the used premise and make it seem new, or at least not as used as it is.  Joy Ride is able to do that.  It's predictable at times, but it still remains interesting and suspenseful enough to keep you interested.That's one thing that this movie has plenty of, suspense.  There are parts where it's almost like a regular road trip movie, but when it switches over and the dark, psychotic side comes out, the suspense kicks into full drive.  There aren't really too many movies that gave me the `edge of your seat' feeling, but this was one of them.  Even in it's predictable moments, it was still suspenseful.  The climax of the movie was sort of a let down after all the build up, but the little twist ending was pretty cool and almost left it open for a sequel.  Although, personally, this is one movie that doesn't need a sequel, even though the ending leaves it open for one.Overall Joy Ride is a good, suspenseful flick.  Not too much blood and guts for all you gore hounds, but it's still entertaining.  I'd say it's worth renting, and possibly buying, if you like it enough.  "},{"Title":"Done that, been there...

I sat up alone in my house and watched it at 300 in the morning, so maybe that's why it had such an effect on me.  Despite the fact that most of you out here are saying it was unoriginal, I still enjoyed it.  True, there were definitely holes in the plot, like with the trucker being able to kidnap the college roommate and still be able to keep track of the three teens whereabouts-that is a little far fetched.What I never got was the who the driver really was.  I was somewhat disappointed when they didn't show his face; all they showed was a dangling, bloody hand which indicated that he was killed.  When one of the teens inquired about who he(Rusty Nail) was, they were told he worked for an ice company.  That threw me off because one of the first suspects for Rusty was the guy in the supermarket who was driving an ice truck, who ended up following them from the supermarket, but turns out he was only following them to return a credit card that one of the teens had left behind on the counter. We definitely rule him out because right after he does good samaritan duties, he gets mowed down by Rusty Nail's tractor trailer and a slew of ice explodes everywhere.  That threw me off completely.  Who the hell was this guy?  I expected him to be some sort of freak show; the way he took the joke so personal and all.

A movie is really scary when it messes with your mind while you watch it.  This is why the 1963 The Haunting was so successful.  This is also why the Blair Witch Project was initially successful... until they finally admitted it was fake (which after the incredible amount of hype they put into making it seem real, you would think that they would have waited at least a year before coming out with the truth.)Joy Ride is not an intelligent thriller.  It's highly cliched, and relies more on cheap thrills and loud music in time with quick action rather than good writing and effective mind-manipulation.  It's entertaining, but highly unbelievable.  I know that there are some sick SOB's out there, but this truck driver is way out in the left field.  A successful scary movie freaks you out because it's realistic enough that it really seems like it could actually happen to you.

One will be that it is nothing more than a cheesy, cliches, teen horror flick with no brain. The other (myself included) will see it as a daring tribute to the old school. After bailing his brother out of jail for the second time, Lewis and Fuller are going on a road trip to pick up a friend from school. Along the way Fuller decides to buy a two-way radio which he uses to play pranks on other listeners. There is a line in here that thinking back seems like our first hint to the olden days of horror flicks. When trying to convince Lewis act as a girl on the air he says that it is not different than playing prank on people in a chat room, just a lot more outdated. So Lewis plays along as a girl named Candy Cane. He makes contact with a Sam Elliot sounding trucker named Rusty Nail. After encountering a loud-mouthed racist at the reception area of a motel Lewis/Candy Cane invites Rusty Nail to the jerks room as a joke, but the next mourning the jerk is found lying on the road in a coma. So behinds our hunt for vengeance as Fuller and Lewis are followed everywhere bye by this faceless trucker. Paul Walker plays Lewis and although he does a fine job as our lead, it is clear that her only got the role as a means for teen sex appeal. On the other hand Steve Zahn as Fuller is funny as hell and has a very natural charm about him. Zahn is a funny guy and this is a funny movie, but not because he is given lots of gags and jumps around like a moron like in say Saving Silverman, but because his comedy flows smoothly. He makes us believe that the character isn't trying to be funny, he just always is in real life. Think Robin Williams in Cadillac Man or Charles Grodin in Midnight Run. It is also very nice to see that raw comedy in a film like this because it gives us the sense that our characters are real, everyday people and we can feel their humanity throughout the film. Most people will condemn this film as having endless amounts of clichés, but it is what sets the film apart from all the other teen road trip horror flicks like Jeepers Creepers and The Forsaken. The fact is these clichés are used with such style that you will know exactly what is going to happen but that only disguises the fact that you have no idea where this film is headed. These clichés also bring back memories of the old horror flicks like Friday the 13th and Halloween, just look at the car the guys are driving and you will be taken on a trip down memory lane. This is the kind of film that uses its story to such a level of suspense that you will find yourself yelling at the screen to go the other way or not open the door but you will be enjoying it instead of getting a headache because of it. The other thing that sets this film apart from the rest of the pack is the cross-pollination of genres. We have horror, comedy and suspense all bundled into one, but instead of being like Scream and throwing it all together as one, director John Dahl interchanges the genres scene for scene. One scene you could be watching a hilarious comedy and the next all the laugher dies and you jump right into a riveting horror sequence and then a tense bit of suspense and right back again. The best example of this is when the duo think they are being chased by Rusty Nail and it turns out only to be a nice trucker returning a forgotten credit card. At this point I had my fingers embedded so far into my chair that I thought a crowbar would be needed to remove them, but once we find that it is a fake and the truckers asks Are you boys alright? Fuller sarcastically replies yes, now that we aren't murdered. I now found myself laughing hysterically at that remake, that is something you don't find in many horror films these days. There is also a scene in a cornfield that reminded me of the Candy Colour Clown scene from Blue Velvet, in fact there are quite a few subtle hints of David Lynch in this film. The scene in the motel room while the boys are listening to Rusty Nail come to the door of the jerk and then they hear a noise and become worried, reminded me of something that could have come out of Lost Highway. Whenever watching a Friday the 13th film I always found that whenever Jason is seen without his mask the impact of the film is decreased. Much is the same here in that when we actually see the killer's face, although only for a moment, some of the suspense is lost. In making the killer faceless the audience must wonder if he is a maniac, a normal lonely guy or even human at all. These possibilities help create tension and suspense because we as humans fear what we don't understand, so when the killer's face is revealed we seem to be robbed of all that was pondered about him during the first half. Lastly I must talk about the ending. I have read many reviews that said the ending ruined the film. I will admit that I was not a huge fan of it myself or the sudden halt in plot that it presented, but credit must be given where credit is due. The ending is trying to answer a few questions that everyone asks themselves while watching films like this. What would happen if the villain really were too powerful for the antagonists? What happens then? Although it maybe doesn't answer those questions to the best of the film's ability, at least it tried. So if you want to think this is a brainless teen movie because it stars hot teen actors then go right ahead. The truth is that yes; teens will enjoy themselves because most of it is a no brainier. But because this film has such a well rounded story there is enough suspense and grit to keep even a hardened film buff entertained, as long as they are not expecting to bust a brain cell over it.

Two twenty-something brothers, Lewis and Fuller (Paul Walker and Steve Zahn), take a cross-country drive to pick up Lewis' would-be girlfriend Venna (Leelee Sobieski). During their long journey across desolate highways, the siblings decide to pass time by playing a prank on an unsuspecting trucker. Via CB radio, Lewis pretends to be an alluring female named Candy Cane and arranges a late night rendezvous at a cheap motel with the unseen trucker who uses the CB handle of Rusty Nail. When Rusty Nail arrives at the motel and discovers that he is the victim of a hoax, he reveals a decidedly homicidal side to his nature and is soon in pursuit of the terrified pranksters in his menacing 18-wheeler. Director John Dahl (Red Rock West, The Last Seduction) does his best to inject some tension into this highly derivative mix of horror and road movies which was handled with greater flair and originality in last year's chilling, Jeepers Creepers.  However, he succeeds admirably during the film's tense, early scenes.  In particular Rusty Nail's motel rampage, which is imbued with a gothic ghoulishness, courtesy of cinematographer Jeff Jur.

Much of this is due to the fact that Walker and Zahn, by virtue of their silly little prank, behave just like far too many young folks we've seen in horror films ever since HALLOWEEN; they basically ask for what they eventually get.  The only real sympathetic character in this film is Walker's girlfriend, played by Leelee Sobieski (DEEP IMPACT; EYES WIDE SHUT)--and she doesn't actually figure into the film until it's three-fifths over!The fault for this must lie with both director John Dahl (RED ROCK WEST) and co-screenwriter J.J. Abrams.  Abrams' screenplay lays out all the typical teen-horror cliches about brainless kids and superhuman madmen from FRIDAY THE 13TH to URBAN LEGEND, but doesn't even begin to do half of what Richard Matheson did with the pre-road rage premise of his screenplay for DUEL.  Furthermore, Dahl, although he does create a certain tension in the film and has a great feel for the truck attacks and the stunts, is not of Steven Spielberg's caliber when it comes to building real suspense to a fever-pitch level.All in all, JOY RIDE falls into the same cracks as did THE RAGE CARRIE 2.

In this case the stupid young people are Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) who is on a journey, by car, to try and score with Venna Wilcox (Leelee Sobieski). Along the way he picks up his roguish brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn), who convinces him to use the car's CB radio to muck around. They pretend to be a girl and get one truck driver, who listens in, to meet them. Unfortunately the driver, `Rusty Nail', is not amused by the prank and they soon wish they had never begun this joke.`Road Kill' is pretty obvious in most regards. You can guess what's going to happen (not least because of the infuriating trailers showing you scenes from throughout the movie) and, when it does, it's not entirely logical or believable (unless, as I did, you hypothesise information which is never revealed). The acting is so-so, except from Zahn who manages the rogue mould with charm - he's both smart and witty, whereas Walker gets through his more flat delivery on virtue of his good looks. However Walker and Zahn do have good chemistry on screen (more so than either of them with the `love interest' of Sobieski).The script though is quite good. The characters are fleshed out far more than they are in other such movies (the most obvious example being `Jeepers Creepers' which also featured siblings versus Mad Truck Driver). There're some genuinely amusing moments, almost entirely due to Zahn who exhibits some skill with comic timing (look out for his piece in the bar when he pretends to take Sobieski to task for not behaving herself). This creates a sense of fun in the picture, as well as characters you give a bit more-of-a-damn than your average Friday the 13th victim.Direction by John Dahl is good here. There's tension when there needs to be and, although some `surprise' moments are far from that (because they're somewhat clichéd), he works well with the material on hand. The pivotal scenes are suitably invigorating, but he knows when to ease on the excitement level too, so the viewer is never drowned by the experience. The music is adequate, whilst being nothing special.The movie is far from outstanding, due to relatively weak performances from Walker and Sobieski, as well as a lack of twists in the storyline. The `fun' quota, with its witty script and smart, crisp direction make this an enjoyable, if somewhat forgettable, ride. 6.5/10.

It doesn't substitute body count for suspense and tapped into some effective key fears. Such as, no matter where you go, your pursuer is always one step behind you. (See Night of the Hunter). Also in doing this, they didn't go too far in trying to explain it. Sometimes, these things seem more plausible if you're given less information. Good use of atmosphere corn field, gas station and bookend sleazy hotel showdowns. It was also better to leave the trucker's face unseen. We know he's a freak, but our imaginations creating the freak makes him that much scarier.  It would have benefited, though, from the exclusion of several clichés. Such as not running off to the side when that's obviously your best bet and the ending that, most disappointingly, tossed in a sequel set-up. These things are too bad, but that's only two strikes.  Adequate performances and the surprise that this movie isn't nearly as bad as you'd expect make this a pleasant once-through.  "},{"Title":"Well done thriller just in time.

Just when America needs it most, here's an escapist movie that scares us in a different way.  `Joy Ride' is about a kid named Lewis (Paul Walker from `The Skulls') who trades in a plane ticket home for a clunker car to pick up his newly single `girl friend', Venna (Leelee Sobieski), to take her back home from college break. Along the way, he finds out that his brother Fuller (Steve Zahn of `Saving Silverman') is in trouble again and picks him up for the ride after bailing him out of jail. Along the way, Fuller has a CB radio installed and the boys begin to have a little fun with a lonely trucker by impersonating a woman and telling him to meet `her' in a motel room along the highway. When the mysterious trucker only known as `Rusty Nail'(Matthew Kimbrough) kills the inhabitant of the room number they gave, they boys realize what they have done, but are too late to stop the trucker's rampage. They later find him on the radio and taunt him, where he then proceeds to follow them across the state lines in search of revenge.  This is a pretty high-paced film that does a good job of bringing the viewer in to what seems like a harmless-prank-gone-wrong situation that could happen to anybody. The characters are likeable enough, especially Steve Zahn. He adds enough comic moments without making it silly. And the villain is shadowy enough (spoiler you never really see his face) to make him menacing in a Dr. Claw-meets-Maximum Overdrive kind of way. Director John Dahl (`Rounders') did a great job with something that could've easily become disastrous. Overall, this one is worth catching in the theater for seasonal reasons, but if you can't handle something like this, there's always `Serendipity'.

The joke turns against them, however, as the trucker by the name of Rusty Nail not only rips the occupant's jaw off, but starts to pursue the three friends relentlessly.To start with, I have to admit that I am rather easily scared by horror movie atmosphere (which is of course part of the appeal), but Joy Ride did not scare me at all. The film's problem is quite simply predictability. You do not have to be an expert of the horror genre to be able to know exactly what is going to happen next. The recipe is simple a mysterious, omniscient villain, three youths on deserted highways, with the usual ingredients like running out of gas at a crucial moment etc. And the makers of course left themselves an opening for a sequel... It's solid stuff, but Joy Ride did not have me on the edge of my seat in the way Jeepers Creepers did. The film's main saving grace is Steve Zahn's performance as the wayward older brother.

Visually this film is great as has come to be expected from Mr Dahl. It looks very moody with good lighting (effective use of reds, blues & greens) & atmosphere, particulary when the pranksters are listening in on next doors activities, rain lashing down the camera pans into a painting of a storm swept boat on a midnight ocean. However the film itself whilst not terrible just doesn't live up to the direction.Steve Zahn is excellent as always but the remaining protagonists are pretty one dimensional cardboard college kids & as such you don't really care what happens to them. There are a few good thrills to be had here - never before has the indicator on a CB been as atmospheric or foreboding - although it is a bit to long. Occasionally the pace falters when it should be pretty much non-stop once the game begins. There are of course the obvious stupid things done by the young cast akin to walking alone into the cellar in a slasher film, but unlike recent teen-horror movies this film is refreshingly free of knowing in-jokes concentrating mainly on the predicament of the hapless trio. Overall this is an okay if instantly forgettable thriller, better than many of the recent teen-horror movies but that isn't really a huge complement. A bit disappointing for fans of John Dahl who has given us the excellent modern noir films such as Red Rock West & The Last Seduction. However it is good to see a movie which doesn't go down the tired route of heavy irony or end up with a man in a rubber suit chasing screaming teens.

I am confident that there are a few visual references to John Carpenter's Christine (1983) and The Fog (1980) in here as well.The film builds tension almost from the very beginning, and never fails to surprise with a collection of well crafted set-pieces.Joy Ride also includes some commendable performances from its young cast. The growing relationship between the brothers is highly believable and provides a fun and humorous backdrop to the barely conceivable horrors that unfold. The voice-over that provides the Characterisation of the truck driver is excellent. Joy Ride succeeds mainly through the mystery and fear of a faceless nemesis and the wrong choice could have seriously undermined the movie.The greatest success of this film, is its ability to maintain such a high level of fear and suspense throughout. Where others have promised, Joy Ride fulfils and you are never quite sure when it's going to end. The film still relies on some classic horror formulas but is hardly predictable and you will never find yourself anywhere other than on the edge of your seat.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, not least of all for providing such a genuinely scary movie experience.

Ever since Spielberg's Duel aired back in 1971, filmmakers have been enamored with the idea of the mysterious, crazed truck driver using his rig as a weapon. There was Breakdown a few years back. Then there was Fast and the Furious, which put a trucker in the vigilante role, but still associated the profession with men having overreactive, violent tendencies. Now comes Joy Ride, which has a psychopathic truck driver terrorizing some college students on a road trip.This keeps happening because truckers haven't quite become a cliche' yet (like postal workers for instance). I could see a writer envisioning one becoming a roaming psychopath. Truckers get picked on because they fit conveniently into that profile. I can't argue with a repeat of the trucker-as-killer plot though, because it works so well in Joy Ride. The action is well staged and executed. The behavior of the characters is believable. What makes it work especially well is the whole you-messed-with-the-wrong-guy scenario. Many good thrillers have been built around this premise of average people doing something foolish and suffering the consequences. Any movie you can believe is going to be a head above the rest. Joy Ride deserves a place among the home video guilty pleasure classics.

Granted, it looked like another silly horror/stalker flick from the previews way back when, but I kept an open mind as I sat down to watch this latest suspense/thriller.While it wasn't spectacular, I did have some fun with it.I think that came from the fact that the leads were enjoyable, and there were some entertaining and funny moments throughout all of Rusty Nail's stalking.  It's the timeless story of two kids driving cross-country, and why it's not a good idea to mess with people too much.  It's also a good lesson in that when one gets busted for something like this, it's not a good idea to tell the recipient of the practical joke what an idiot they are for falling for the gag.What we're left with is an angry truck driver who remarkably has more leads and connections on these kids that the Psychic Friends Network could only dream of having.  Therein lay the problem for me.  Rusty Nail knew remarkably too much about these characters, and I kept wondering why is it that he never had to report in to anybody, like his bosses for example.  Don't truck drivers have to keep a schedule, and aren't some trucker agencies going to be more than a little unhappy if these schedules aren't met?  I don't know of too many truck drivers who have the luxury of postponing their deliveries to go chase a few practical joking kids all over the country for a few days.  Maybe that's a benefits package I simply haven't heard of.Regardless, some of the scenes were entertaining (the fate of the ice truck early in the film comes to mind), there were funny moments, a decent tense spot or two, and given the circumstances and how far one is willing to just sit back and relax with the movie, some of the situations concocted managed to work.  I'm just very glad they chose not to use some of the DVD's alternate endings.  They had Rusty Nail come off as more of the Terminator in terms of endurance.It's a fun movie to sit around with friends and talk about.

Fuller persuades Lewis to disguise his voice as a woman, under the name of Candy Cane and talk to Rusty Nail(eerily voiced by Ted Levine).  Candy Cane tells Rusty Nail to meet her at a nearby motel and to bring some pink champagne.  The trucker naturally, does not know that it is a trick and when he shows up, imagine his amazement that Candy Cane does not exist and that a old fat man is in the room.  Fuller and Lewis are waiting next door but soon enough things start to go awire for them.  They begin to here some rustling sounds in the room next to theirs.  They call room service to have someone come up and take a look around but find nothing.  The next morning Fuller and Lewis are being questioned by the police because the man who was in the room next door has disappeared.  They tell the police they nothing and go off on their way.

Once they get their kicks out of it, they just move on however the trucker, not knowing it is a joke, still wants to meet the girl (Candy Cane) he has spoken with over CB radio. They continue the joke by arranging a false appointment with the trucker and the fictional Candy Cane at a Hotel room whereas they should've called the quits. They realize that they have started a deadly game when the trucker turns out to be a psycho-pathic killer. From then on, two brothers try to run away from the trucker who keeps coming after them with his huge vehicle. The chase becomes something more than just a traffic harassment after they pick up Venna on the way. What I Like About Joy Ride Joy Ride is a very successful suspense movie with a clever plot full of twists. The scenes are very nicely done and they work perfectly fine. Director John Dahl does a great job of combining humour and suspense through the acts and sometimes even in the very same scene. One minute, the audience laughs and in the next they gasp in excitement. Steve Zahn gives a riveting performance as Fuller Thomas; he is a perfect cast for this role.  What I didn't like The ending could have been more satisfying although I don't know what kind of ending would have been more satisfying. Since you know nothing about the identity of the trucker, no matters what happens to him at the end doesn't create much excitement. Plus the inference that his real identity may still be a mystery even at the end seems like an invitation for a sequel.

But what I got was a poorly done by-the-numbers thriller with several numbers missing. Joy Ride is typical of movies these days that present a few good set-piece scenes but don't make them come together into a satisfying whole.The problem here is almost exclusively in the script. The villain is a chillingly evil, faceless trucker who is apparently omniscient. He knows everything about his victims -- who they are, where they are at all times, even where their friends are. But how? This omniscience is never even remotely explained and makes no sense. Without even this semblance of logic, the events in the film have little context and carry little punch. If the kids in the film were dealing with a maniac who, bad as he is, has to play by the same rules of reality as everyone else, and thus can be outsmarted, the film would have some point. As it is, it's just a series of scares that quickly becomes ho-hum.What a disappointing misuse of a great cast and a talented director.  Who green lights things like this?

Joy Ride does what it does well enough. The problems lie in what it doesn't do.Nothing is believable in this semi-remake of Spielberg's Duel. It's silly to think that the well grounded brother would put them in a dangerous situation simply because of a little prodding from his small time criminal sibling, poorly played by an equally bad actor. It's ridiculous to suggest that the villain, naive enough to fall for an obvious prank, would be crafty and tenacious enough to follow not only the brothers, but their friend across the state. A couple of intended surprises are anything but. You can see them coming way down the interstate. When they get there it's disappointing. And not one, but two damsels in distress? The writers must have picked that up at a used script lot near the place where the younger brother bought his ill fated automobile.Joy Ride is thrilling and exhilarating and I confess I had fun with it.

What irony after the terrorist's attacks and the drop off in air travel to have your own terrorist behind you in a 16-wheeler. Lewis (Paul Walker) is seduced into picking up a former girlfriend of a friend and driving home. Not that he's an unwilling participant in this cross-country jaunt, but this is not the thrill-ride he anticipated. And since no good deed ever goes unpunished, Lewis detours to Salt Lake City to bail out his prodigal brother.  The ticket for an illegal U-turn ticket is only the first of many missteps.

The CB radio, a car-warming gift from Fuller, is the perfect example of this manipulator determined to create surroundings in his image and likeness.  Fuller chooses the handle Black Sheep and names Lewis Mama's Boy then lures an anonymous ominous-voiced trucker Rusty Nail with a falsetto Lewis who slips into the moniker of Candy Cane and suggests a rendezvous at a roadside motel. Whew, are you following this? Their prank brings them close to becoming road kill but they haven't yet picked up Lewis' love interest Venna (LeeLee Sobieski).  Besides adding the Candy Cane that Rusty Nail seeks, she also tips the balance towards reason and away from the older but unwiser Fuller.

The trailer more or less gives you a complete description of what happens in the film, but that means absolutely nothing. When the film started, I was thinking to myself, This is so programmed, and I know what is going to happen next here, but that did not last very long at all. Yes, at first the film seems to take this very artificially programmed horror genre and do what it has done before, but then it does what you would have never expected it to do, take a completely different path than you could have ever imagined. The imagery, editing, score, and lighting techniques, not to mention the fact that we never really see what the killer looks like is utterly terrifying. At the end of any of the 3 scream films (if you were scared at all), when the audience finds out who the killer is, it is not as scary anymore. In our society we always want to know the how and why of everything. I guess you could take that and apply it to various individuals who are afraid of dying and turn to god. Regardless, not knowing has always been nerve racking. My best example; Jaws. If we could see the shark for the fake mechanical malfunctioning Bruce, which it was, who cares?When you watch a scene and say I know what is going to happen next, he is going to come barreling out of the cornfield just like did earlier in the film a few times, and then something completely different happens is scary because you are not prepared for it. It is unpredictable. Isn't that what makes scary movies scary? Not knowing who it is or where they may be certainly is to me. After all, if we saw everything from rusty nail's point of view, who would be scared? At one point, the two brothers try to figure how far their CB radio's signal range may reach to another CB, indicating it may be just 5 miles or so. Is it? who knows. This is indication of a feeling that the psychopathic deviate may be a lot closer than you think, even if you are on a great big stretch of highway.I live in a small college town and there is nothing to do here except either drink or watch movies. I watch movies. I have seen classics, horror, drama, foreign, and everything else in between. In conclusion, the plausibility and realistic point of view when you watch ANY film is always in question to a certain degree. If it wasn't, who would watch it? Would have U-571, Erin Brockovich or Patch Adams have made any money if they were even close to reality? Probably not. U-571 was not as action packed as in real life, that water has never been proven to cause cancer and Brockovich has numerous lawsuits pending against her as well as practicing law without a license, and many people have died under Patch Adam's care trying to use his methods. Maybe most people in a panic would go seek the police in a situation such as these kids, but how would any of us know until it happens?The reality of a movie such as this or many others does not matter. If anyone looks too deep into a plot of any movie, sure, they are going to hate a film. Just as people try to compare a book to a movie. They are two different mediums so don't even try.This movie is supposed to be entertainment, not an analysis of what we would do if it were us. It is easy to say, Oh, I wouldn't ever be that dumb as to not do this or that, but seeing as most people don't recognize their own actions no one has any room to say what character of a film should or should not do. Everyone in this world is different and we all handle our lives and problems differently. Being critical towards an artistic and truly entertaining piece of work and ruining it for others just because you don't agree with the character's personality, motives, and coping strategies in a movie is not the way to go. Some people like some films that others do not. It all depends on the person.This movie is not reality.

Don't come into the theatre armed with cynicism and a desparation for barebones realism.  Do come to the theatre prepared to put yourself in the backseat of the aged Chrysler and ride along with 3 young people who do some really stupid things.  Then prepare to feel some of the best suspense cooked up by Hollywood in a long time, as the 3 young people pay for their stupidity. The plot is a simple one.  Lewis(Walker) has a crush on childhood friend Venna(Sobieski). He trades in a airline ticket for an old car, smart move these days, so he can pick Venna up from her college on the long trek from Ca to NJ.  On the way he finds out his petty criminal brother, Fuller(Zahn)is in need of being bailed out of jail, so goody goody Lewis bails him out.  Fuller has strange ideas of fun on this trip, ideas that include buying an old CB radio.  At first it seems that the radio will be used for a speed trap finder but soon Fuller has Lewis pretending to be a girl and giving verbal advances to some scary sounding trucker named Rusty Nail.  Before you know it someone dies, via Mr Nail.  The chase is on and Venna hasn't even been picked up yet.  Some suspensful moments occur and the viewer is left to think that Rusty Nail might be done f*cking with the brothers.  So once Venna is picked up, a good time is had by all including heavy drinking and Fuller trying to get into Venna's pants, for which she almost obliges.  But before this can happen, that damn Rusty Nail guy shows up again.  Hence, the chase begins again to the climax of the movie.There are many gut wreching moments of suspense in this film.  There also many moments you want to reach out and b*tchslap one or all of the kids. Of course these kind of plotlines don't exsist without characters who do stupid things.  The lighting in this film was beautiful and set the tone for many of the suspensful scenes. My only complaint about the film is there seems like there might have been more to it after the ending.

Thankfully, Hollywood chose to surprise me Joy Ride is a skillfully blended movie that is funny, light-hearted and maintains a palpable tension, and does so without a massive body count.  Joy Ride reminded me of Spielberg's classic film Duel with Dennis Weaver, except that in addition to the malevolence of the unknown trucker, we understand the reason for the senseless brutal attacks, and there is a viable subplot with a cast of interesting characters, fleshed out by a talented cast.Paul Walker was hired for one reason - he has a pretty face.  This is not meant to impugn his acting abilities - although he isn't given many opportunities to demonstrate his thespian skills, he does prove himself adequate for the task - but states a simple truth.  As Lewis he is meant to epitomize the good guy hero, and the hero rarely gets the good lines.  Leelee Sobieski stated in an interview that she took the patented chick role with the sole purpose of having fun and turning Venna something more than the stereotypical female who does nothing but scream.  Even within the limited confines of her character, you can see her talent sparkle.  However both characters are outshone by Steve Zahn's manic portrayal of Fuller providing both comedic relief and visceral emotions, Zahn, much like his performance in Happy Texas is the centerpiece of the film, bringing all the elements together.  Finally, there is the unnerving duo of semi and driver who supply constant tension.Joy Ride is one of the few thrillers to come along in a very long time that will actually keep you on edge, without relying on buckets of blood.

What I would like to talk about is how JR makes one come to question the thought processes that take place while watching a movie and when developing one's opinion afterward. I must say, I enjoyed watching this movie.  But as it proceeded I found myself having a lot of problems with plot occurences.  So I proceeded to ask myself  What is it about cinema that allows us to enjoy the process--the journey, if you will--yet you are having problems with what is taking place?For example, things were happening in JR that were rather unbelievable, yet watching the film was enjoyable because of the storyline, the possibilities, the characters and the filmmaking.  I found myself hoping that the filmmakers were going to have some impressive explanation as to how many of these plot occurences could happen, and when that did not ultimately happen in the end, I found myself pondering the question that is the nature of this critique.I thoroughly enjoyed my journey, though I felt cheated at the end because I truly have a problem with a film that develops a sense/feel of the real, yet ends in a manner that could truly not be possible.  But then what do we watch movies for?  Part of me hopes that these creators are going to be so imaginative, that by me giving myself to their creation, they are going to prove to me why they are the ones making films.  But at the end of JR, I am left with a philosophical question  Do I like this movie (because I thoroughly enjoyed it while watching it)?  Or, because the ending is so implausible, does it make it a bad film?  Hmmm.... "},{"Title":"Fasten your seatbelts!

The tension is palpable!The fact that this is a highly plausible scenario and not some far fetched sci-fi gross-fest only adds to the tension.  Paul Walker and Steve Zahn are excellent as two brothers who could be the guys next door.  Everybody knows people like this. They aren't trying to be mean,just being pranksters who forget that even psycho truckers have feelings.  You can bet they won't make that mistake again! Leelee Sobieski,looking and sounding like a young Helen Hunt, is also effective as their friend,who they are driving to pick-up at college. She'll wish she had taken a bus!A bit of a spoiler here-if you wish Rusty to remain anonymous, read no further. As far as I am concerned,the incredibly talented Ted Levine steals the show as the sinister yet sensual voice on the CB. This man is so good,you don't even have to see his face for him to have a profound effect. He scares the daylights out of you just by saying, Candy Cane!The big rig is used to good effect too,especially at night.

Well, you'll see what I mean when you see the film, but the story is a cool tense one.Lewis is coming home from college, and when he learns that his crush would like to drive home from her college, he turns in his airline ticket and buys a car and is headed to pick her up. But he calls his mom and once again his brother, Fuller, is in jail and Lewis volunteers for the job of picking him up. He does so and then installs a CB radio to know the way home, but Fuller wants to have fun and plays a prank on another truck driver, he makes Lewis pretend to be a girl called Candy Cane and to meet them at the hotel in a different room where another guest is staying. The next morning, the guest is brutally injured and in a coma, then the truck driver is stalking both brothers. They apologize and he backs off, but when they pick up Venna, Lewis's crush, the driver wants one more joke... for fun.Joy Ride is a constant tense thriller that reminded me somewhat of the Hitcher, it was awesome, it reminded me of some John Carpenter films.

Two brothers bonding to outwit and evade a psychotic trucker (voiced by the wonderfully menacing Ted Levine) is pitch-perfect in pacing, thrills, and atmosphere.Everything changes once Leelee enters the picture. The plot becomes incoherent, the chemistry is sabotaged, and the well-earned tension is shattered. Worse yet, the decision to reveal the antagonist is not only jarring (this is clearly not the Mr. Lotion we all know fondly), it evaporates the air of mystery around his character. Had this movie stuck with the brothers while relegating Rusty Nail to just some deranged, detached voice on a CB radio, we'd have a near classic on our hands.JOY RIDE comes recommended, with a caveat that it could have been better.

It doesn't take itself too seriously, and at the same time shows us unrelentingly grim events unfolding that might actually be possible, walking a steady tightrope between camp and genuine fear. Paul Walker, that handsome devil, plays Lewis, a nice guy on a road trip with his screw up ex con brother Fuller (eternally goofy Steve Zahn in full ham mode). They are making their way across the southwest to pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski), Lewis's friend, which he plans to change. Also along for the ride is an old CB radio that Fuller hauls along for his own amusement, listening in on trucker jargon tossed across the airwaves. Soon they stumble on an ominous frequency, presided over by a growling denizen with the moniker 'Rusty Nail'. Something's clearly not quite right with this weirdo, but being the dumbbells they are, they foolishly play a pretty mean prank on him over the air, causing him to snap. Rusty Nail isn't just some lonely trucker, but a belligerent, unforgiving psychopath, and worse, he's smart. He launches a backroad crusade to torment and psychologically intimidate the two of them, continuing on when they meet up with Venna. The voice of Rusty Nail is provided by one other than veteran cowboy Ted Levine, using his guttural, menacing drawl to wonderful effect, and hitching the movie up a few notches just by doing so. Telling you to put the lotion in the basket is nothing compared to the threats we get to hear him utter here. Walker, Zahn and Sobieski hold up their end well enough, but are mostly there to be frantic, idiotic bullseye targets for the unseen monster trawling the interstate after them through the night. Much of it is silly and stretches the boundaries of credibility, but it's all in wicked good fun, and always has a knowing sense of what it takes to make a high concept, low morale style thriller work. Just remember... Rusty Nail needs to find Candy Cane.

Paul Walker and Leelee Sobieski are heading for Colorado but along the way Walker ends up bailing his brother, played by Steve Zahn, out of jail. There is a C.B radio in the rental car so Zahn suggests they play a prank where Walker imitates a female wanting a good time. They are answered by a deep voice from a guy calling himself rusty Nail. When the prank results in a murder the two realize that they are being stalked. Tense up until its action violence ending where improbability plays a strong factor. Director John Dahl adds suspense by using atmosphere to his advantage. He previously made a similar film called Red Rock West. Walker and Zahn deliver strong performances as they come to realize that sometimes a prank can go into overkill. Leelee Sobieski also factors in once she is kidnapped and facing a shotgun trap. Jessica Bowman is featured briefly as her college friend who is also kidnapped. Rusty is only partially effective because it is never known how he stays ahead of the game. Ted Levine, who played the nasty Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, voices the less impressive Rusty. It plays off the cry wolf theme well resulting in an eerie ride in suspense.

That's not to say it's boring until the real thrills start - there is always a good deal of interest throughout. One of the interesting things is that unlike most other thrillers, the protagonist brothers are portrayed to not be all that likable. That might sink another thriller, but here it actually helps; I was amused and satisfied to see these somewhat unlikable people put through a number of torturous experiences.

After a prank that is not really all that mean-spirited, a trucker begins mercilessly stalking them, and the guy's idea of getting even is much too close to murder for everyone else's tastes.What I liked about the movie above all is that Steve Zahn and Paul Walker make a convincing set of brothers. I feel like they had some really good, organic dynamics together. I also enjoyed the overall pace of the movie. It keeps moving and coming up with interesting concepts and setups to keep its audience entertained as these people are chased all over the place by this villain. Speaking of which, Rusty Nail (as he is called) works as a villain that is partially threatening, psychotic, sympathetic and funny. It keeps the violence to a tasteful level and if you're looking for a horror/thriller film that has a bit of bite but never goes into very gruesome levels (save maybe for a brief scene in the beginning) it's fun and has some good laughs too. I just happened to own this movie on DVD and if you do too, or if you're renting I have to point out something that I usually don't for these reviews. The DVD includes what is without a doubt the most extensive set of alternate endings I've ever seen.

What that takes mostly is some sort of enemy bent on murder or mayhem, here played by a mostly unseen trucker. His truck, as in Duel is a big menace. This truck is really powerful. At one point, it slices right through a large ice truck with no perceptible damage to itself. The trucker (Rusty Nails) is a creative sociopath who gins up a way to get Leelee Sobieski's head blown off. This kind of movie demands potential victims, and in this case, it's two brothers, plus a girl friend (Sobieski), and assorted others that show that this man is dangerous. The connecting link is simple. The two brothers have played a practical joke on Nails, and this arouses his killer instinct.For parts of the story, The Hitcher came to mind, because Rusty Nails knew a great deal about the brothers and their movements.The story is totally implausible, but it hardly matters. Hollywood thrillers are efficient at providing thrills, not explorations of character, theme, or dramatic conflicts growing out of the typical human condition. This kind of movie is designed for thrills mixed with some comedy, and Zahn supplies most of the latter. To get the thrills, all you need is some kind of nut case or monster.

It's not strictly a horror film, though it does have, at times, more suspense than many so-called horror movies. It sort of feels like a cross between Robert Harmon's The Hitcher and Spielberg's Duel. I imagine Richard Franklin's Roadgames coming close too, but I still have to see that one. Joy Ride starts pretty average, but it does get better and better. And it all leads to a terrifying, suspenseful climax. Ted Levine's voice is really great & creepy, perfect for the part, but I was a little bit disappointed that they used another actor to briefly personify his body during the final scenes.

Although the screenplay was a bit static and formulaic at times, the actors, especially Zahn make the film worth it. Walker was not bad in the lead, although my favorite performance from him is still Running Scared. Leelee Sobolewsky is not bad as well.

It's got its moments of force-fed tension, but that's not the reason I really like it. What I really like about it, and what really plays true, is the chemistry between Lewis (Walker) and Fuller (Zahn). The interplay and dialog between these two is very believable and HILARIOUS. For the first part of this movie, I spend more time laughing than anything else. That being said, it does have all the hallmark classics that Hollywood seems hell-bent on to drum up tension and supposed fear. I wouldn't get too hung up on nitpicking its qualities or lack thereof. It's simply a fun movie to watch.

Two brothers, and the potential girlfriend of one of them, are pursued up and down America's back roads by a murderous trucker. Not very original I admit, but director John Dahl elicits as much humour as suspense from the situation and has a real feel for the small towns and truck-stops they encounter. It's the kind of movie that makes you never want to spend the night in a cheap motel in the middle of nowhere. As the boys, Steve Zahn and Paul Walker give likable performances, considering the characters they play are so unsympathetic. You start out hoping they get what they deserve and end up rooting for them.

This CB is like a prehistoric internet or something. Well, just how scared am I supposed to be? Much more than usual. Sometimes these simple (premise) movies without the huge budget or tons of special effects are worth catching. Paul Walker (sigh) plays a college freshman on a summer road trip to pick up his girlfriend. Along for the ride is his smart-ass brother who uses the car's CB radio to play a cruel but harmless prank on a lonely trucker known only by the handle Rusty Nail. The gag backfires though and the siblings soon find themselves on the run from a psychotic murderer, out for revenge.The creepy dude from 'Silence Of The Lambs' (Ted Levine) is the chilling voice on the CB. His voice is unmistakable and because the viewer never gets to see his face he really added to the freaky element for me. Actually I'm not even sure if its that he was so good or I'm still traumatized from his performance in Lambs.I also enjoyed Steve Zahn, usually the comedy sidekick roles annoy me but he was really good.

It is a deliberate B-movie and one which is very much self-aware but thankfully not self-referential.Paul Walker and Steve Zahn play the two leads in the film, brothers who anger a truck driver (voiced by Ted Levine) who proceeds to chase them and make their life hell. Halfway through the movie Leelee Sobieski shows up after a brief scene at the start of the film and looks pretty and gets into dangerous situations. Yeah, it sounds pretty awful but it's so earnest and entertaining that it works somehow. Ted Levine is really great as this truck driver who calls himself Rusty Nail. You don't actually see him at any point in the film but his voice acting is excellent. What is refreshing about Joy Ride aside from it just generally being a decently-directed and well-shot movie which is a lot of fun, is that it's completely gore-less. There's one scene towards the end of the movie that is mildly violent, but it's not something you wouldn't see in a tame X-Files episode.

In Salt Lake City, Utah, he springs his fun-loving, delinquent brother Steve Zahn (as Fuller Thomas) from jail. While on their way to pick up cute Boulder, Colorado coed Leelee Sobieski (as Venna), the men hear a trucker named Rusty Nail on their CB radio. In a joke cooked up by Mr. Zahn, Mr. Walker pretends to be a sexy woman named Candy Cane; and, he sets up a date with the horny Rusty Nail. Alas, the trucker can't take a joke, and decides to terrorize the travelers! John Dahl's Joy Ride features some good locations and camera-work, which doesn't add up to as much as it should, due to the film's huge storyline familiarities; it's sometimes suspenseful, and seldom scary. The lead character, and his likely complicated relationships with a troubled brother and potential girlfriend, come across as unusually bland. The intriguing villain (well-voiced by Ted Levine) is, also, not too intense.The earlier parts of the film are more interesting, and/or original (the brothers in the hotel room, for example). The latter acts are less effective retreads. Notably, Walker and Zahn have a contrived public nude scene, courtesy of Rusty Nail. The cornfield part of North by Northwest is employed; and, the old gun and door trick was used with more clarity and suspense by Thayer David (as Count Petofi) on Dark Shadows (episode #841).***** Joy Ride (2001) John Dahl ~ Paul Walker, Steve Zahn, Leelee Sobieski "},{"Title":"An excellent, gripping and suspenseful danger on the road thriller winner","Date":"24 November 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":" During a lengthy cross country trek from Boulder, Colorado to Princeton, New Jersey amiably impudent chronic loser Fuller (an engagingly feckless Steve Zahn and his more sensible, but gullible do-right brother Lewis (an admirably sturdy and composed performance by Paul Walker of The Fast and the Furious) decide to pull what they think is essentially a harmless prank on a colorfully lascivious trucker who goes under the faintly sinister handle of Rusty Nail. Alas, the actually quite cruel and nasty prank the boys play on the unsuspecting Rusty turns out to have have greater and more severe repercussions than they expected. Pretty soon the irate, vengeful and dangerously crafty Rusty is subjecting the hapless siblings to an extremely harrowing campaign of terror in which he teaches the reckless slacker duo a long, painful and often most brutal lesson that all actions, even allegedly silly and facetious ones, do indeed beget serious consequences for everyone involved in them.Sure, the highly reminiscent of Breakdown and especially Duel central premise seems hackneyed and sounds unpromising, but fortunately what we got here is one of those wondrous examples of how a pretty shopworn danger on the road thriller story can be substantially redeemed and made bracingly effective thanks to a brisk, taut, straight-down-the-line streamlined and efficient execution. Tightly wound B-picture noir specialist John (Red Rock West, The Last Seduction) Dahl's bang-up proficient direction deserves a lion's share of the credit Dahl's persistently firm control of quick, steady pacing, a spookily uncertain atmosphere fraught with tension, several heart-in-your-throat nerve-ripping scenes of vehicular carnage, and fiercely concise and to the point pretense-free narrative economy all come through with excitingly crisp and on the money results. The smart, compact and neatly realized script by Clay Tarver and J.J. Adams likewise scores a bull's eye with razor-sharp succinctness, offering amid all the frights and scares a nicely thoughtful and incisive critique of reprehensibly immature and irresponsible Generation Xers whose flagrant disregard for other people's feelings is a fertile breeding ground for all kinds of grievous trouble. Better yet, Rusty Nail isn't some one-dimensional brutish creep; instead he's the sole guy in an increasingly callous and inconsiderate society who still has a conscience and as a result this makes him nutty, touchy and not to be trifled with. The remarkably perky and attractive Leelee Sobieski as Lewis' sweetly endearing college girlfriend makes for a winningly feisty and fetching damsel in distress. And special kudos are in order for psycho thesp supreme Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs), whose vocal only turn as Rusty Nail is nothing short of extraordinary Levine's deep, phlegmy, gravelly croak -- a superbly throaty rumble that's all awkward pauses and guttural rasps -- forcefully projects a genuine sense of seething menace and a certain raw, devious cunning with striking vividness.

The 3 young main characters are likable and the suspense is palpable. During most of the film there is subtle humor, unexpected surprises, a brief but titillating love-triangle side story, and the kind of suspense that films used to have; they understood that what you can hear but cannot see is scarier than graphic gore. Adding to the fun are the completely implausible chase scenes. Up until the last 15 minutes or so it was a really fun film. Unfortunately it seems that the filmmakers didn't have a real ending and felt the need to replace the subtly with gore to give it a punch at the end. I was disappointed at the clichéd ending; a talented writer could have pitched in to help give this clever film a much better finale.

He turns out to be a total wacko and is hungry for revenge. That's the plot of this movie. Pretty thin isn't it? The plot for Spielbergs Duell was even thinner and was enough for a classic of its kind. Maybe one of the reasons why it was that good was the fact, that you really could identify with the victim and prayed for his survival. The main characters in Joyride are so annoying that you pray that the trucker will get them! You got the impression that Dahl is trying to prove that communication between people is senseless the way the two brothers get from one sticky situation to the other as if they were impersonating Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. There is one (and only one) real creepy scene in this movie which makes the rest of it, with plot holes, cheap scares and everything, even more disappointing. The only actor that makes it worthwhile is the one you don't see Ted Levine. Anyway it's good enough to waste some tranquil time.

'Jeepers Creepers' exploited this, by bringing you a terrifying road movie with a twist. Roadkill (or Joy Ride &#150; US Title) takes the road movie down a slightly different route. Lewis (Walker) and Fuller (Zahn) are two brothers heading to pick up Venna (Sobieski), a friend of Lewis'. On the way, they decide to have a bit of fun with the CB Radio, and wind up the lonely truckers. Using the alias 'candycane', they get in contact with 'Rusty Nail'. They decide to take the joke a little further. After fuller has a particularly nasty encounter with a guy at a motel, they invite rusty to the guys room. Lewis and Fuller are in the room next door, waiting. When muffled noises and thuds can be heard, they soon realize that the joke will soon be on them. The next morning, the police are surrounding the place, as the guy in the next room is viciously attacked. It soon becomes apparent 'Rusty' doesn't like jokes, and a game of cat and mouse ensues, as the vengeful trucker chases them down.The movie has an interesting premise, and has all the ingredients to be successful, but somehow falls flat. The script doesn't always hit the right notes, and can leave you feeling a little bit flat. However, there are some genuinely tense moments, and the ending had me biting my nails until the conclusion. Marco Beltrami provides you with a wonderfully tense musical score, similar the ones we are familiar with from the 'Scream trilogy'. This does tend to liven up the proceedings, even if the on-screen action is a little dull.I can't say I remember this movie being in the cinema, and it's not really hard to see why. But, once you get past the movies smaller flaws, you do have an original thriller with some tense and exciting moments. The DVD of the movie is pretty good value as well, containing now fewer than 4 alternate endings, 3 commentaries, and your usual trailers and featurettes. It isn't the best movie, but one worth at least watching, perhaps with a few friends, and just having a good time. 3 Stars  "}{"Title":"Good waste of time","Date":"9 September 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  I actually liked this movie.

It's also a John Dahl movie, the man who made Red Rock West and The Last Seduction. These movies have far more complexity in their plotlines, but here it's the simplicity of the story and the background (deserted highways) that make it work. Actually the movie is a lot better than what I expected (a B-movie). Here, just like in Duel, you don't get to see much of the bad guy, just enough to know it's a creepy trucker with a bad sense of humor. And actually, throughout the whole movie, what you don't see, but want to see is what will make you keep watching. Suggestion is used well here, pretty much all that is used is a voice on a talkie and a truck with invisible driver.

That being said, it's no big surprise that many horror movies out now are simply a repeat of what we've already seen.  Honestly, that's to be expected.  Being a huge fan of horror/thriller/chiller/etc, I love a movie that has the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Sure, you probably know what's going to happen...there *is* a formula afterall.  But a movie that can STILL be suspenseful given the fact that we've seen it all is rather impressive in my book.  Such was the case with Joy Ride.Now, mind you, I didn't watch this with the expectation of seeing something totally new or original.  Nor was I expecting an Oscar nominee.  What I was expecting was exactly what I got  a modern-day thrill ride straight back into the horror films of old.  And that's more than fine by me. The acting was well done on all counts and isn't the overly cheesy drama typically associated with horror films.  LeeLee Sobieski is, as usual, fantastic.  Steve Zahn does a great job adding humor to the movie and portrays bad boy Fuller Thomas pretty well.  Paul Walker does an equally fine job playing the more level-headed brother Lewis Thomas.  I have to say it is refreshing to see a horror movie with good acting...now *that* is something we have not seen much of in the horror genre.Dahl does a great job with building up suspense...especially on those lonely isolated backroads.  Furthermore, the voice of Rusty Nail, in and of itself, is about as freaky as can be and contributes fantastically to the general thrill of the movie.For general entertainment, thrill value, and decent acting, I give Joy Ride a 9 out of 10.  As far as horror goes, this one does a decent job of providing the scares so many are lacking.

On the way, he learns news of his troubled older brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn) who, once again has to be bailed from jail in Salt Lake City. So, as he is the 'good-fortune cookie' of the movie, he casually swings by and whips out his cheque book. With the two Thomas brothers on the road, conversation is dry, dull and generally based around sex. Typical. To pass away the hours on this hot and long journey, Fuller has a Citizen's Band radio inserted so they can fool around with the locals. He prattles around in different phoney accents, gaining kicks from willing respondents. It's not until he persuades good-to-do Lewis to imitate a girl, 'Candy Cane', that an aroused character 'Rusty Nail' begins to respond. From an intelligent, original and film-noir fanatic, you'd expect a thrilling, unpredictable, morbidly dark tale. But after spending a mere one-and-a-half-boring-hours in a cinema complex, sloshing back litres of coke and sugar, one thing is certified. Anyone with a brain (ie you and me), will find it to be a patchy re-hash of Spielberg's 'Duel', Robert Harmon's 'The Hitcher', and cheekily making a take on Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest'. Yeah, it is aimed at a younger audience, hence the use of fresh faced young-one Paul Walker, and the reasonably experienced Leelee Sobieski, but we know Dahl can do much better, we've already seen it. The brilliant film-noir thriller 'The Last Seduction', is what any educated movie viewer would pin Dahls' name to. It has all the key elements, complex and twisted characters, a constant dark and grainy B-movie appearance, and above all - a bloody good plot. And a bloody good plot is what 'Roadkill' ain't got. Its' splattered somewhere between 'sneaky teenage plagiarism' and 'writers' block'. Perhaps these are the effects of moving into a studio based production. So, whilst becoming bored with the characters' constant questioning and vain attempts to foil Rusty Nails' dangerous driving, its pretty hard not to think of Bridget Gregory. It's an image that Dahl cannot escape. But who would want to? Being sucked up into the world of this neurotic, narcissistic, foul-mouthed, manipulative 'bitch' is a life experience not to be missed. The majority of us would not dare to act so curt to 'friends', but its not like anyone is ever going to challenge this woman. On her entrance to any room, whether it be accompanied by a cheery, `You maggots sound like 'suburbians' ', greeting, or a coolly confidant stare, the picture becomes ever darker. It's most unusual for the main character to have such extreme views on life, motivation and sexual relations. But, perhaps these complex personalities are contracted to add interest into the background, provide a little entertainment while the main heart-throb in pole-position wallows in their self-pity whilst having everything the world could ever give. It's a formula we've been force fed since the first film. As Lewis, Fuller and Venna sit in the shadows and whimper, they gain 'vital' sympathy points from the audience. Wind back to '92, and Dahl is creating Bridget, a New York super bitch who has been ripped from the shadows and brought into the daylight, centre stage, as main character. It's a beautiful sight. Despite Dahls' best attempts to create a central role that would be hated by audiences, through no fault of his own, didn't. Vengeful cheated women set up their own 'The Last Seduction' Club, exchanging heated remarks about their husbands, and deeply admiring Fiorentinos' dominating woman. Yes. This was real-life. It was the impact that Bridgets' twisted nature had on the public, it was the change from the portrayal of modern characters on film, it was the difference between 'The Last Seduction' and 'Roadkill'. It was distinctive and unregimented. Not at all formula film pap. You wake up in that back breaking cinema chair. Wipe a bead of 'boredom-drool' from your chin and take a quick look around. Near-on every viewer with even a sliver of entertainment knowledge has drifted into that slouchy `I-don't-want-to-be-here' pose that sticks its' self as an audience for 'Roadkill'. Okay, okay, so the production team probably spent weeks planning the vicious attack on buildings by 'Ol Rustys' monster truck, and it's only golden boys' second cinema appearance, but shouldn't a gifted director be able to pull at least a decent death out of the bag?Apparently not.Dahl simply cannot pull a wonder piece out this poorly written and produced piece, where practically every scene in the entire film has been experienced elsewhere. The situation feels like a familiar warm jumper, and you know that you've experienced this before, only Dahl has played around with some mood lighting, giving everything that neon or headlight glow, making you think this is new. But it's not. The characters are stereotyped, there is always some boring love interest, always some ticked off psychopathic killer wanting to scare the Holy Ghost out of anything that moves, and its guaranteed that the golden-boy-good-cookie (Lewis) is the one who dobs you into the cops. Although it might not be completely ethical and politically correct, but when no strand of evidence or information links you to the scene of a murder, you do not walk in, open palmed and say 'We know who did this. We set it up'. That's called Being a fool. We'd much rather take the advice of black sheep brother, Fuller, `Be a martyr all you want. That's not what I'm doing.'. This single shred of common sense, comes from its dumbest character. As the final minutes of this film roll out, the audience realise that this is, in actual fact the scariest thing in living memory. Rusty Nail hasn't been caught. Which, I'm afraid, means, there is likely to be a sequel. Shudder. "}{"Title":"One of the best pure thrillers of the decade.","Date":"7 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  *** 1/2 out of ****As I started watching Joy Ride, I wasn't necessarily sure what to expect. Yeah, the trailers made the film look like a frightening ride, but the previews also seemed to give most of the plot away, and the box office returns were surprisingly low for a teen-based thriller (JR actually somehow grossed less money than Swimfan?!). Well, have no fear; even though the trailer does give too much away (avoid it if you can), Joy Ride is an intense, nail-biting thriller that surpassed my expectations.Paul Walker stars as college student Lewis Thomas. He's just bought a car and is on his way to Colorado to pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski), the girl he's always had a crush on, and take her home to New Jersey. But on the way, he stops in Salt lake City to bail out his brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn, who's absolutely marvelous), who he hasn't seen in five years. Fuller decides to tag along with his brother and even has a CB radio inserted into the car. That's when Fuller decides to play a joke on a gravelly-voiced trucker who calls himself Rusty Nail. But this little prank has an unexpected backfire, and Fuller and Lewis suddenly find themselves in a deadly road game of cat-and-mouse.Plot-wise, Joy Ride is heavily reminiscent of Duel and Breakdown, with maybe a little bit of The Hitcher thrown in for good measure. The fairly young cast will probably remind some of recent slasher films such as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer. But you'd be wrong to merely place this as another teeny-bopper thriller that's simply out to crank as much cash as possible from its unassuming audience. From first scene to the very last (and I do mean VERY last), Joy Ride is gripping, heart-pounding entertainment. What director John Dahl has done is take an old, but quite intriguing premise (the road-trip horror/thriller) and craft it into a funny, scary, and suspenseful thrill ride that stumbles only a few times throughout its entire running time. Dahl's great with both the physical action and the psychological head games. There are the chase scenes, which are exhilarating and furiously intense. Yeah, they don't feature the mayhem of the car chases in Gone in Sixty Seconds or The Fast and the Furious but they're far more effective because you actually care about the characters, the situation, and the outcome.Psychological thrills aren't as prevalent, but are effective. For almost the entire film, you only hear Rusty Nail's voice, so the fact that he could be anybody our protagonists encounter adds that much more to the suspense. It's also more frightening not knowing what he looks like, and his voice alone is enough to creep you out (see if you can guess which actor voices him).The performances are overall quite good. Pretty-boy Paul Walker is showing improvement with every film he makes (he was awful in The Skulls and is decent here; quite impressive, I might say). Leelee Sobieski is like a teenage Helen Hunt, and I can't really seem to look beyond that. But the scene-stealer is top-billed (yes!) Steve Zahn, delivering a terrific performance that would be worthy of an Oscar nomination in a fair world. This man is hilarious, with a carefree attitude that feels entirely genuine and addictive. And when all the on-screen horror begins, he seems so convincingly terrified, you can't help but keep your eyes glued to the screen. He's also got great chemistry with Walker, and I wouldn't mind seeing these two playing siblings again in another film.Like I said the film does make a few stumbles. Around the half-way mark, the movie inexplicably slows down for a lengthy breather, which isn't paced very well, though it does feature a hilarious improv bit from Steve Zahn when he encounters a group of rednecks. The cat-and-mouse road games are quite elaborate and unlikely, with Rusty Nail knowing seemingly everything about these brothers and staying one step ahead of them the whole time. That's actually only a minor complaint, considering that the elaboracy quickly builds suspense, since you're never certain what's going to happen next (take, for instance, the hair-raising scene with the road signs and the car trunk). Then there's Rusty Nail himself, who at the end, you get a few brief glimpses of. Dahl probably shouldn't have let us get that good a look at his physical appearance, but just as bad is why they didn't use the same actor who voices the part to also play the part (if you know who I'm talking about, then you'll know how genuinely creepy this guy can act and look).But these problems are hardly detrimental. The slow middle is just a gear-up for the last 1/3 (about 35 minutes), which features one high-octane, frightening set-piece after another at a non-stop pace, all aided by Marco Beltrami's excellent score, probably his best yet (it's derivative of his work in Scream and Michael Kamen's score in Event Horizon, but it makes for a damn good mix). The last fifteen minutes features one of the most exciting and chilling finales I've seen in years. Don't let anyone spoil it for you.The DVD displays four (!) alternate endings for this film, including one that runs 29 minutes! Having seen all these conclusions, I can say with confidence the one Dahl chose to go with is the best. Joy Ride was unfairly ignored at the box office, but now on DVD and video, it'll hopefully find the large fan base it should have received. This film was released the same year as Jeepers Creepers, that other psycho truck driver chasing those darn teen siblings thriller, which I also highly recommend and would make a good double bill.

The Speilberg classic!Duel A man being chased by an anonymous truck with a lunatic driver. Road Kill 3 teenagers being chased by an anonymous truck with a lunatic driver. The differences are only there to bring it into the next century without confusing the audience.  In duel it didn't matter why the man was chasing the driver, because it worked, but with Road kill people need a reason. A back fired joke later and there's your story. If I'm honest I don't think they did that bad a job of it, plenty of suspense, a few bits to make you jump and a nice girl slapped in the middle. Of course it doesn't have the drama and mystery of duel, why should it? It wasn't meant to be a Duel.

It was let down partially by some ridiculous character names. Fuller is a surname but that can just about pass. Unfortunately 'Venna' is more a noise than a name and consequently you spend the 1st 30 minutes arguing what her name is.I knew nothing about the alternative endings on the DVD until I came on here. I watched Roadkill on video & the end lost the film a mark or two, largely due to the Rusty Nail character ending up too farfetched. Knowing their names, where they were going and being able to follow them across America unnoticed. Some of the loose ends could so easily have been tied up better, maybe by making the villain the original sherif which I was assuming.I wouldn't call this a horror film, but like any of these sort, there are times when you'll want to chin the lead characters for sheer stupidity (and for accepting teen roles despite being over 30). There was also a point when Rusty got out of the lorry clearly on his own, that they could have got have ganged up & collared him, but that aside one of the better & more gripping films out at the moment.7/10 "},{"Title":"A different plot for a teen horror flick","Date":"20 October 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  When you think of the typical teen horror movies, usually a killer chasing after high school students come to mind. Well, this movie is way different then that. It's about a killer chasing *college* students. Seriously though, I actually liked this movie. Most teeny bopper movies make my eyes roll to the back of my head. This one didn't. It was a lot more clever than most horror flicks. There are some parts that actually require paying attention to details and yes, even gasp reading! If there is one thing to complain about it's Leelee's acting. I have always set her aside from other young starlets because she seemed more talented than the Freddie Prinze Jrs and Jennifer Love Hewitts combined. I don't think it was at any fault of hers because she really wasn't given much to do in this movie. Steve Zahn really stole the show here.  In conclusion, if you want to see a teeny bopper flick that has to do with Hollywood teenagers (see actors in their early 30's) car chases, and corn fields then this one's for you.

Rusty Nail was faceless villian who pulled off some pretty frightening things as he pursued two hilarious idiots named Lewis & Fuller.  Terrific stuff!!This film was only 90 minutes long and they didn't waste a minute of it with any useless filler.  They got the ball rolling less than ten minutes into the movie and it never faltered anywhere.  And it didn't have your typical, sappy Hollywood ending, either.  That sure made me happy.A few things to note, for those who havn't figured things out, Rusty Nail had at least one accomplice in his ordeal with Lewis, Fuller, & Venna.  How else could he have hunted down Charlotte & then tracked down the other three in Nebraska?  He had to have had help.  And remember the final scene w/ the ambulance CB?  Rusty Nail was obviously calling from an accomplice vehicle that was carrying him off into the night.  It was smart of the director to just imply the presence of accomplices rather than introduce them because that would have been too complicated. In short, this was great summer entertainment.  7/10.

Joy Ride is a kiddie thriller, hardly above the level of a film in any of the slice and dice horror series of the 1980s. The acting was of the WB variety. This is a major step in the wrong direction (no pun) for Dahl, but then he is not the first director who made a few exceptional films only to then turn to making tripe to pay the bills.

(minor spoilers)","Date":"22 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  I can't even remember seeing any previews for this film.  In fact, I had never heard about it until I strolled on in to the video store.  Anyway, Joy Ride is a really different, fun, and interesting film that has a very nice cast.The story setup is a bit unusual and very much entertaining.  I was pleased to say that I was happy with the movie beginning to end.  Lately anymore all I've been seeing are good movies that start out good, have good actors, and a good script, yet fail miserably at the end.  The start of the film was nice and jumped right into the story.  And yes, I liked the end of it too. The cast really appealed to me.  The more I see of Steve Zahn, the more I like.  I've viewed a couple of his films and he always makes me laugh.  Not that this film is a comedy or anything, but Zahn still managed to make me laugh most of the time.  I've also seen Paul Walker in a lot of films, and finally this is one where he actually IS a character and lines.  Walker's performance wasn't all that great, but he had his moments.  Some were good, some were bad, overall, I liked him in this movie.  Leelee Sobieski is usually good in the roles that she has, but I definitely would not have casted her as Venna.  She was a tad bit on the annoying side.  It seemed as if she tried to do too much with what little she had.  She didn't even have that big of a part!  Once that she did come into the picture for good, the three actors worked nicely together.  Zahn was the standout though.Along with many others, I agree that there were a lot of questions left unanswered.  (ie  How did Rusty Nail find Charlotte and WHY exactly did he kidnap her?  How did he know that Lewis and Fuller were brothers?)  Just some minor stuff like that kind of got a little irritating.  That's okay, the film turned out to be great despite all that.I like that the film takes place on the road.  I like that the characters communicate by radio and that a simple, harmless prank might just end up killing you.After reading some comments, I see that a lot of viewers didn't care for the ending.  I actually liked it.  Such a nice ending that left that little what-if there.  Do I sense a sequel?  That would probably be a bad choice, but so be it if there must be one.  Joy Ride ended quickly just after everything was explained, it didn't drag on and didn't have one of the last line things that makes me frown just as it cuts to the credits.Joy Ride is an underrated flick that has a lot of things to enjoy about it.  It's not scary, but just a nice film that has an important message (don't talk to weirdos over a CB radio by the name of Rusty Nail).  I highly recommended it. "},{"Title":"Good Performances Make This Quite A Ride","Date":"3 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  By definition, a `joke' is something said or done to promote laughter or amusement; but more than that, a joke can be a helpful instrument for discerning character, establishing bonds of friendship or merely relieving stress.  Laughter, as they say, is the best medicine.  A `practical joke,' on the other hand, is something else entirely.  In fact the term, `practical joke' is, in itself, an oxymoron.  It is never `practical,' and rarely does it promote `laughter and amusement,' especially with the recipient upon whom it is perpetrated.  More often than not, the result is nothing more than the embarrassment and humiliation of the intended victim.  In extreme instances, in fact, it can actually become the antithesis of a joke, ultimately producing dire consequences and repercussions.  Which is exactly what a couple of bored young men discover on a trip across country in `Joy Ride,' directed by John Dahl, a film that points up the possibly extreme effects of a single moment of thoughtlessness; and how lives can be changed in the time it takes to draw a single breath.The drama unfolds between Salt Lake City-- beginning when Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) stops to pick up his just-released-from-jail brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn)-- and Boulder, Colorado, where Lewis has promised a ride to his friend, Venna Wilcox (Leelee Sobieski).  En route to Boulder, the bored and thoughtless Fuller coaxes Lewis into playing a practical joke, via their CB radio, on a trucker they know only as a disembodied voice with the handle `Rusty Nail.'  Lewis affects a woman's voice, calls himself `Candy Cane,' and arranges a rendezvous with the hapless Rusty Nail at a designated motel room.  At the appointed time, Lewis and Fuller listen from the room next door when Mr. Nail shows up and finds someone other than Ms. Cane in residence. What follows is not pleasant for any of those concerned, and especially for the Thomas brothers, who discover too late that Mr. Nail is anything but hapless.  He is, in fact, dangerously unstable-- and devoid of any sense of humor.  He also has the wherewithal to find out more about the brothers than is good for their health.  At one point, Lewis and Fuller think they've lost him, only to find out after they pick up Venna, that Mr. Rusty Nail is very much present and accounted for; and that's when things take a real turn for the worse.  What began as a moment of frivolity turns out to be a defining moment in their lives, and it's the beginning of a seemingly endless nightmare for all of them.Director Dahl has crafted and delivered a film that is part `Duel,' part `Breakdown' and a `Ride' that is altogether wild and adrenaline inducing.  This film is not what you think it's going to be-- it's much more.  What Dahl gives you is some real thrills and genuine menace, delivered with a solid impact and a subtle message about doing unto others and stopping to think before you speak.  And the young, unaffected and inexperienced may shrug it all off with a laugh, but there's a real lesson to be learned here about the difference between a high school or college dorm prank, and thoughtlessly provoking a stranger out there in the real world, where a swagger, machismo and all that testosterone will seem ridiculous when you're alone in the dark of night on a lonely stretch of road, and it all comes down to that moment of truth.  Reality can be sobering, and it can be humbling.  And the sad thing is, there are too many among us who choose to learn it the hard way.  But with this film, Dahl gives you a good taste of what it's all about; all you have to do is catch a glimpse of the terror in Fuller's eyes while it's all going down.  Unfortunately, it 's a message that will be lost on those who would best be served by it.For all intents and purposes, this is a three character drama, and the actors Dahl has cast to bring it to life do just that, beginning with Paul Walker, who turns in a solid and quite natural performance as Lewis.  He successfully captures that youthful, somewhat naive innocence that defines his character, and his portrayal is honest and convincing.  And Leelee Sobieski, as Venna, continues to demonstrate that she is one of the finest young actors in the business.  This is not a particularly challenging role, but she makes it more than it is by bringing a maturity and insight to it that a lesser actor would find elusive.  It's a wonderful performance, and it definitely takes the film to a higher level.The performance that really stands out, however, is turned in by Steve Zahn, as Fuller.  Zahn captures that rolling-stone, loser aloofness of a guy basically just drifting through life, coming from somewhere that isn't important and going nowhere.  And there's at least a part of Fuller to which just about everyone in the audience will be able to relate and identify.The same is true of the characterizations of Lewis and Venna, but it's especially apparent in Fuller, and that connection Dahl and his actors enable the viewer to make with the characters and their situation is the predominant strength of the film.  It's a collaborative effort that allows you to fully appreciate what they are going through as the story unfolds.  Also significant is the participation of Ted Levine, who supplies the voice of Rusty Nail, possibly the most menacing voice-over since James Earl Jones created Darth Vader.The supporting cast includes Jessica Bowman (Charlotte), Stuart Stone (Danny), Luis Cortes (Night Manager), Satch Huizenga (Ice Truck Man) and Jim Beaver (Sheriff Ritter).  An action/thriller that really delivers, `Joy Ride' is a rush of ice water through your veins that just might make you think twice about what you want to say sometime; and to whom you want to say it.  8/10.

It tells the story of two brothers, Lewis and Fuller Thomas, who are going cross-country to pick up Lewis' high school sweetheart, Venna Wilcox. On their way there, the two brothers decide to play a practical joke, with a CB radio, on a truck driver known only as 'Rusty Nail'. When the joke takes a deadly turn, Lewis, Fuller, and Venna are all relentlessly stalked by the madman who (obviously) took offense to the joke.Writer and director John Dahl creates a wonderful sense of danger and terror surprisingly well. The talented cast (featuring Paul Walker, Steve Zahn, and Leelee Sobieski) also deserve major kudos. Marco Beltrami (composer for the SCREAM trilogy) impressed me with his dazzlingly eerie score. Everyone else who worked on this film also deserve a LOT of credit!The one thing that makes JOY RIDE so scary is that you never get to see what 'Rusty Nail' looks like. You only know him by his creepy voice. Scary and suspenseful scenes are aplenty in this movie. There are parts that scare you in a 'BOO!' way and others that scare you in an 'edge-of-your-seat' way. There were 2 or 3 parts where I was so scared that either I was going to have a heart attack or scream at the top of my lungs, right in the middle of the theater. The film also has a delightful amount of humor.In short, I highly enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of suspense.

So, his new film Joy Ride came with some hope that a filmmaker could actually produce a quality horror/thriller starring a young cast. Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) and his brother (Steve Zahn) are on a road trip when they play a cruel prank on a stranger they talk to on a CB radio. When the prank goes awry, the heat turns on them as the stranger starts hunting his pranksters. Eventually, Paul's friend Venna (Leelee Sobieski) joins them on their trip and the mystery man stalks all three by leaving them verbal and visual messages to follow.Unfortunately Joy Ride is one of those films, which asks us to leave our brain at the door after awhile. The implausibilities pile up faster then you can blink an eye. The mysterious stranger seems to know where they are at every point, and can even find them in one scene in a maze of cornfields. The stalker even finds the CB radio they threw out the window (how he miraculously knows where they are at all times is beyond me). This isn't a terrible film by any means, there are a few convincing and creative scenes. The scene near the end with the cops and raiding the hotel doors has nail-biting intensity. The ending though, which of course I will not give away is rather disappointing and unconvincing considering all the events which led up to that point. (The DVD of Joy Ride features several alternate endings. One of which,  the conclusion focusing more on Venna, which was not finished and is partially shown through storyboards, I felt was the most effective ending of all. Including, the denouement left in the film.)This film gets a 4 out of 10.

The idea is good (a prank gone wrong) but they (director, writer, producers, etc) had NO idea what to do with it or where to go with it. Great beginning, nearly disastrous ending. The ending itself in the final cut is OK but when you consider the fact that they re-shot the entire ending, more than 20 minutes, which is a big chunk of the film, then this clearly makes the ending seem even more lackluster and unimpressive than it is right now. The alternative/original ending is available for all to see on the DVD, which is almost as boring or unimpressive as the one in the final cut.I've never seen such a massive re-shoot for a film. The last third of the film was completely changed, which tells me they had no idea what to do with the story and the characters, the good guys and the bad guy. It's truly mind boggling when you consider that with all the people involved in a movie no one could come up with a better conclusion to the story they meticulously set up during the first hour.Anyway, at least the first half is good, even if it's predictable and implausible (the killer knows a lot about the two pranksters...).

Abrams, and directed by John Dahl (The Last Seduction, Red Rock West), the road thriller Joy Ride isn't the most believable or probable movie of this kind that one will ever see, but it's slickly made, and is genuinely tense often enough to make it a fun, if not remarkable view. It gets a lot of mileage out of the presence of its villain, a psychotic trucker. For the most part, he's a voice on a CB radio, and the movie does lose something once the filmmakers start showing him on screen. The climactic action is engrossing, as is one incredibly creepy scene (heard instead of seen) in a hotel room.The actors certainly are capable, selling the hell out of the material at every turn. Paul Walker stars as Lewis, a nice guy who's eager to meet up with a girl he's interested in, Venna (Leelee Sobieski). So he cashes in his plane ticket, buys an old car, and travels cross country that way. Along the way, he bails his no-count brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) out of jail, and Fuller gets the bright idea to buy a CB radio for the car. He then gets another not-so-bright idea play a prank on a random trucker by having Lewis impersonate a female. But things take a very dark turn, and this trucker, who dubs himself Rusty Nail, is furious at being lied to, and exacts his revenge by stalking the brothers, and Venna, once she joins them.Sometimes the movie is silly, sometimes laughable (admittedly this viewer couldn't help chuckling every time Rusty Nail said the name Candy Cane, and Walkers' attempt at a female voice is groan-inducing), and positively goofy (Rusty Nail orders Lewis and Fuller to waltz into a diner sans clothes). But Dahl delivers solid action and suspense, and stresses the isolation of various rural locations to great effect. Atmosphere and photography are beautiful. Walker is likable, Zahn a hoot as always, and Sobieski is cute. Appearances are made by such character players as Basil Wallace (Marked for Death), Jim Beaver ('Supernatural'), Robert Winley (Stone Cold), and Kenneth White (Fire in the Sky), but the movie really belongs to the uncredited Ted Levine, who's supremely sinister and endlessly amusing as the voice of Rusty Nail. He adds that something extra to the experience.Overall, this is an enjoyable ride to take.Seven out of 10.

Many films have tried and have failed to do what Joy Ride definitely succeeded in doing.Some might try to draw comparisons between Joy Ride and Duel...and yes, there are definitely certain similarities, but personally I find Joy Ride to be a lot more entertaining.My main problem with Duel was that the main character was trying to get to a business meeting by a certain time, that's why he was on his road trip in the first place. After he had his run in with the mad trucker in that movie, once it was clear he wasn't going to make it to his meeting in time -- why didn't he just turn around and start heading for home? Instead, he keeps heading toward his original destination despite the fact it really makes no sense for him to.In Joy Ride, Paul Walker and Steve Zahn's characters have got to pick up Leelee Sobieski's character no matter what.

Having previously impressed me with a pair of superlative neo-noirs, 1993's Red Rock West and 1994's The Last Seduction, he also, I find, has helmed a quite gripping exercise in suspense, 2001's Joy Ride. An updating of Steven Spielberg and Richard Matheson's 1971 TV film Duel for a new generation, Dahl's film (coscripted and produced by future TV bigwig J.J. Abrams) can stand on its own as a sterling accomplishment. In it, two brothers, driving cross country in a 1971 (!) Chrysler Newport and en route to pick up one of their college-age lady friends in Boulder, choose the wrong trucker on whom to play a sexual prank call via CB radio. This trucker, who remains a disembodied voice for the bulk of the film (we only get to see the big lug once, for a split second), identifies himself as Rusty Nail, and sets out mercilessly to exact revenge on the two brothers and their gal pal. Early sequences in a motel and deserted backroad are extremely suspenseful and well done, before the film takes a breather halfway through...only to come barreling back with several more segments that ratchet up the suspense quotient to the breaking point. The Master of Suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, may well have approved of Dahl's methods of tension buildup throughout, and indeed, a scene that transpires between the hapless trio and the psycho rigger in a deserted cornfield almost comes off as a tribute of sorts to that classic cornfield sequence in North By Northwest. In the leads, Paul Walker and Steve Zahn are just fine as (respectively) the decent Lewis and the wisecracking smart-ass Fuller, as is Leelee Sobieski as the increasingly distraught Venna. The film features an all-too realistic string of circumstances that spiral wildly out of control, and if Rusty Nail strikes the viewer as a tad too omniscient, it is all in the service of a terrifying film that should manage to enthrall just about everyone. Real-life truckers require certain stimulants to keep themselves awake, but nobody will get sleepy during a screening of Joy Ride!

Back in 2001 and further back in the 90s, remakes were a unique thing to look forward too. That may sound hard to believe, but some had some effort and actually looked like thought and time were put into them. To resurrect an older series back then was a unique idea. But now, its just a joke. Though this one is very good, and goes on my favorite Horror movie list and favorite remake list. It combines likable protagonists, good scare scenes, and a mean revenge taking trucker with a hell of a voice. Props to to Ted Levine.Lewis (Paul Walker) has picked up his delinquent brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) from the police station on his journey to pick up his friend Venna (Leelee Sobieski). n the trip, Fuller buys a CB radio, a tool used for communication among truckers. Fuller convinces Lewis to pose as a girl under the codename Candy Cane and lure trucker Rusty Nail (Voiced by Ted Levine) to a room in a hotel were a man is staying to pull a prank. When the prank backfires, leaving the man half dead, Rusty Nail realizes that Candy Cane is fictional and hunts down the three teens as they race for their life in this electrifying thriller.This is basically the What Not To Do section in The Unwritten Book of the Road. It's a hear-pounding thriller that leaves you in suspense throughout. The performances by Walker and Zahn maybe classified as one of the best of the decade. Ted Levine, I must say, put a lot of effort into the Rusty Nail voice. Making his voice raspy and scratchy was the creepiest tone he could've set it too.The sleeper-hit, though cult classic spawned a sequel entitled Joy Ride 2 Dead Ahead featuring none of the original cast, not even Levine, with the only big name actor being Nick Zano (who worked on The Final Destination a year later).The thing I absolutely love about this film is it's creepy tone and creepy scenes. The fact you never see Rusty's face, just adds to the scare factor and makes you really wonder, who is this guy? The movie performed drastically bad at the box office opening on a poor weekend, but blowing out on VHS and DVD sales in late 2001, early 2002. A well deserved frightfest that should be a lot more recognized than it should.Starring Paul Walker, Steve Zahn, Leelee Sobieski, and the voice talents of Ted Levine (uncredited).

Even though their characters and their acting are so routine, I surprisingly enjoyed them. Call it the writing, call it chemistry, call it whatever you want, they worked well together in this film. Zahn needs to stick to what he knows (comedic relief in supporting buddy role) NOT, COMEDY LEAD (National Security, Strange Wilderness)Dahl did a great job with this film. I enjoyed his other film Rounder as well, which leaves me to wonder why this guy isn't directing more films. J.J. Abrams is one of the writers, maybe that is a reason why this film feels different. It doesn't have that cookie cutter routine genre feel to it. J.J.

On the way to get Venna, Lewis goes out of his way to go to Salt Lake City to bail his brother Fuller out of jail where is in for being drunk and disorderly. Fuller decides to tag along and, to avoid the police speed traps, buys a CB radio. Bored, they start messing around and hook a trucker, aka Rusty Nail, by pretending to be a woman looking for dirty chat. They push the joke too far by arranging to meet up. However when the trucker savagely mutilates the patsy in their joke, the Thomas brothers leave the state behind &#150; not knowing that Rusty Nail knows who set him up and has decided on revenge.The presence of Lost and Alias writer Abrams will suggest an interesting film to some (and ward off others like garlic to Dracula) but really this is a retread of Duel but with more plot added and a lot of tension and excitement removed. What remains is a serviceable enough thriller but it doesn't really grip in the way that Duel does, because all the plot that has been added is rather contrived and makes massive jumps without any explanation or logic (specifically &#150; how does Rusty Nail seem to know everything and be everywhere). Were it gripping it would prevent you questioning but it only distracts, which didn't buy it much latitude from me. It moves along well enough for b-movie type thrills but just don't expect too much from it.The cast should be a clue as to the quality of what you are looking at. Not to put too fine a point on it but the headlining of Steve Zahn is rarely a good sign. Both Walker and he do so-so jobs and suit the level of the film; they perhaps aren't able to raise the material but they churn it out well enough. Sobieski is average here &#150; she has shown potential in other things but here she just does the basics. The unseen Rusty Nail is an OK character but it is hard not to compare him with his much better counterpart in Duel.Overall then a solid enough thriller but nothing that special. Those reviewers saying it is like Duel but better are only correct in one way &#150; it is a bit like Duel. However it is nowhere near that level and the additions only serve to slow it down and introduce niggles into the telling. Fans of Steve Zahn should give it a try but for me, I'll be back with Duel next time.

In fact it's the stuff potential nightmares are made of and that's of course something Hollywood knows too. So sooner or later someone had to come up with the idea of making a horror movie about a mad trucker and that's exactly what they have done with this movie...Joy Ride starts with the college student Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker), who decides to drive across the country to see Venna (Leelee Sobieski), a friend who he has always been in love with. She's single now and he finally wants to tell her what he feels for her. But he has one big problem, his brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) is in jail and Lewis will have to bail him out and take him home with him. During their trip Fuller and Lewis play a joke with a trucker, only known as 'Rusty Nail', by telling him over the CB radio that Lewis is Candy Kane, a woman who is interested in meeting him. At first they have a good laugh with it, but than the joke takes a very serious turn and the trucker wants more than just an apology from the three friends...I guess the main reason why many people would give this movie a try is because of the good looking actors. Leelee Sobieski nor Paul Walker aren't exactly known for their excellent acting skills, but I'm sure most people have heard of them before and don't mind looking at them for about 1.5 hours. And I guess it's the best this movie has to offer, because the story is a bit weak, although not entirely bad. It's just one of those stories like there seem to be at least 50 others. It never offers much originality, but it certainly has some nice action and moments full of tension to offer, which eventually saves the movie. In fact, this isn't even the worst horror movie ever, even though it is clearly a movie that wasn't made with a big budget. I give it a 6/10.

As vibrant rock music plays at all the usual teen road movie signposts, their biggest problems at the moment seem to be Lewis (Paul Walker) trying to win the heart of longtime crush Venna (Leelee Sobieski - a dead ringer for Helen Hunt in both looks and voice) and his black sheep brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) who can't seem to stay out of jail. Yet something nasty happens on the way from college to home and soon their fun turns into a race to stay alive. 'Joy Ride' is both as naturalistic as horror thrillers get and as purely cinematic and absurd as movies get. The film is an invigorating gem that breaks the usual story form enough so you're never quite sure what will happen next. Now, really, how often does that happen? Especially in the horror genera.Billed as a typical teen slasher movie and sure to be touted by wannabe critics as a Duel rip-off, 'Joy Ride' is elevated above most of it's source material by a solid cast, attention to character and well developed, often funny, dialogue. Steve Zahn finds that perfect balance between frenzied oddball and appropriately subdued in his first lead role. Paul Walker is nicely cast in the role of an uptight, wooden jock being pushed to loosen up that effectively plays off his Keanu Reeves School of Acting abilities. J.J. Abrams' ('Alias') & and Clay Trevor's script gives a good amount of attention to the characters and their relationships. They seem to know each other before the movie began and aren't constantly consulting the script for their motivations. In the 3rd act, when the movie turns into a Rube Goldberg cartoon as our heroes race from one roadside motel to the next it's that great set-up and solid characters that let us take their hand and make the leaps in logic with them. Horror-maestro Marco Beltrami delivers one of his most memorable and effective scores in years. It goes wonderfully with director John Dahl's (Red Rock West) expert direction. His attention to atmosphere and ability to keep the screws tightening is commanding enough to pull the audience to the edge of our seats. Aside from the character development, Joy Ride distinguishes itself from the average slasher movie in that it is really about something, about the sometimes thoughtless way that people can treat each other when technology like the internet, phones or - in this case - a CB radio put barriers of anonymity between people. Our villain, going by his CB handle Rusty Nail, exercises revenge on our lovable anti-heroes not out of spite or evil, but loneliness and humiliation. He is a mortal lurking in shadow, but much of his existence is limited to a voice over a radio. He seems to have a God-like wrath and an omnipotent pool of knowledge to work with. And unlike the idiots that wander around and open doors when they aren't supposed to we actually root for Lewis, Fuller and Venna. The vehicles of terror, not the big rig as much as paintings, phones, gas stations and motels.All of this is grand fun and made even more precious by it's quick, barely 90 minute running time. It moves - gets in and gets out, cleverly sewing up itself up (those who think the end is a sequel set up clearly just don't get it) and leaving it's characters with their dignity. Joy Ride could have just as easily, and commercially, been the usual throw-away teen horror flick, but the care and attention put in by all involved raises it to a level at the top of the genera heap. One of the best movies of the year. It's comely.

After years of rip-offs in the vein of Scream and talentless music-video directors given dumptrucks full of money to make said rip-offs, Joy Ride is a shockingly pleasant surprise.  It definitely helps that veteran director John Dahl (Red Rock West, The Last Seduction) is at the helm--his use of color, lighting, and a pace where suspense is built through implication gives the film a sturdy foundation.  The performances are nothing more than what is to be expected from the genre--the cast of pretty faces deliver the bare minimum.  Paul Walker is the likable but bland hunk; Leelee Sobieski is the damsel in distress, acting in her usual Queen-of-the-Highschool-Drama-Club style; and Steve Zahn is Walker's comic-relief brother.  The youth play a practical joke on a lonely trucker (voiced by Ted Levine, whose unseen villain is the real star here), who exacts his revenge through a pervasive game of cat-and-mouse, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.  Yes, this is familiar territory, but Joy Ride isn't the plagiaristic ripoff you might expect--it quotes from such films as Duel and The Hitcher, but joins their rank instead of being a forgettable underling.  Here, subtlety and suspense reign supreme, as opposed to blood and guts--a pleasant rarity in the modern horror arena.7/10 "},{"Title":"Now they know how it feels to be a f***ing punchline!.","Date":"30 January 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Steven Spielberg's DUEL has been one of my favourite films for years, so I also tend to like films which are similar to it.  There are some similarities to both it and THE HITCHER in ROAD KILL (as JOY RIDE is called in the UK), but the film is not just a rip off.  It has a great, suspenseful story and credible performances. POSSIBLE SPOILERS College student Lewis and his trouble-making elder brother Fuller are on a road trip to their home in New Jersey, intending to stop in Boulder, Colorado, to pick up Lewis' friend Venna.  On the way, Fuller has a CB radio installed in their car, and the pair decide to play a prank on an unseen trucker known only by his CB name, Rusty Nail.  This turns out to be the biggest mistake of their lives and thus begins a living nightmare for them and later Venna as Rusty exacts revenge with the aid of his black eighteen-wheeler.  The comparison to THE HITCHER can be seen as Rusty always seems to be one step ahead of his prey. As with DUEL, the truck is seen more often than the driver is, but here the driver speaks and we do briefly see what he looks like. Every time his voice comes over the CB or the phone, it is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine! I was disappointed because it didn't say who played the psycho trucker Rusty Nail in the credits.  But, thankfully, IMDB revealed that secret.  Two people actually play him.  One actor plays him when he appears in the flesh, and his voice is provided by character actor Ted Levine, who gives a performance of extreme menace throughout. I don't understand why they couldn't have Levine play RN in the flesh as well, because he certainly looks menacing enough. Paul Walker of FAST AND THE FURIOUS fame is great as Lewis, as is Steve Zahn as Fuller, although he is an unbelievable a*****e as the film begins. Most of the other characters, with the exception of Venna, just come and go. The menace is suitably built up, even in the early scenes.  A good example of this is when the boys listen from their motel room as Rusty visits the room next door (they have tricked him into thinking that a sexy girl is waiting there for him when in fact a bigoted, loud-mouthed man is in there) and hear raised voices, and then silence.  The tension is great in this scene as Walker believes he hears a gasp from the next room and has the night clerk phone the room.  We hear the phone ring in the next room but no-one answers it.  Needless to say, the redneck turns up nearly dead the next morning.Thus begins Rusty Nail's revenge.  The way this scene is filmed is brilliant as Lewis and Fuller listen up against the wall and a storm thunders outside. Towards the end, as the final part of Rusty's plan is put into action brings the tension to an all-time high.  Road movie fans and thriller fans should not be disappointed by this picture.  Call it JOY RIDE or ROAD KILL, it's still one of the best films I've seen! Great for late night viewing (although I watched it during the day).

So I checked this creepy little horror out and unfortunately this doesn't, for me, go down in history as a good one.Trying to be completely neutral and not let my own personal non enjoyment get in the way, my biggest problem was the ending. I actually liked a few things about Joyride, one being the genuinely frightening, creepy atmosphere. Joyride wasn't at all campy. You could feel the tension leaping off the screen. This was a genuinely frightening movie and the quiet dark atmosphere worked well too. At the same time the movie had an almost noirish atmosphere about it at times and the characters were all well developed as people and there was humor involved as well, an example being the hilarious scene where the two male leads walk into the restaurant naked. And Rusty Nails was genuinely frightening. So that's a few positives. But there were a lot of negatives too.This movie is really gory and violent as many horrors are(though Joyride is almost unnecessarily so) and I'm not one for that though it's to be expected, but in addition to that, it just turns into a cliché and another typical horror by the end. This would have played better as a not to violent, more sedate, movie-more of a drama. I think I'd have enjoyed it more that way anyway. But the cliché factor isn't the only problem. The movie goes from cliché to ridiculous. It contains an ending that makes absolutely and completely no sense and there were more plot holes in the last few minutes then in ten other horror movies combined. I don't think the movie can have it both ways-don't try to be a serious horror and then throw an ending like that at the audience. It almost insults our intelligence because the movie's strength was that something like this could really happen, WITHOUT all the supernatural stuff becoming a part of it. It veers into the unexplainable with that ending also, to many things that don't make any sense, and leaves one feeling cheated. All this would have been fine if it had played like a supernatural type movie or straight out horror from the beginning but it didn't. And it just doesn't go with the rest of the movie. It was incredibly frustrating.I really wish this had been more of a straight drama. I didn't enjoy it at all but did sit through it to see the ending. I mean the movie IS great at building tension, I'll give it that, so you sort of want to see how it will turn out, but I did feel cheated by the ending.I think the ending was probably done like that to set up the possibility of a sequel. I wouldn't see it, more then likely, I'd just ask somebody how it ended. I can't say I liked Joyride and after seeing so many complaints about the ending both on the message boards and in the reviews, I just gotta wonder what the point was.I'd rank this a low 3 for the reasons mentioned above. I was disappointed in Joyride though the performances were great.

Also Walker's constant blank face gets annoying--good thing he's good-looking. Zahn tries his best but he can't totally save the film.

His motives are never clear, other than the I'll make you guys pay! The means of which he accomplishes his acts are never explicitly (or implicitly) stated either. Rather, everything must be assumed. This in itself would not be so bad, since the antagonist can stay hazy for the purposes of the plot. However, the protagonist (played by Paul Walker) is not much better in terms of getting a sense of the character. The opening scene depicts a dorm room with books haphazardly spread about. It is later revealed that he is at Berkeley on a full scholarship. This is what I have the most problem believing. Then why the hell is he such a dumbass? In fact, his brother and his friend are much of the same. For the most part of the movie, they run away screaming, nevermind the fact that they outnumber the bad guy three to one. They never think of picking up a weapon. And yes, they even meet the bad guy in a dark corn field in the middle of nowhere alone.For the greater part of the movie, I wanted the bad guy to catch them and torture them, resulting in slow, painful death. Whoever said the characters are real is either very stupid, or very stupid. I don't see how anyone can relate to the characters, unless the people they know have an IQ that rivals most rocks. Put aside the lack of character development and unbelievable plot devices, the director was quite effective at creating tension and conveying the fear of the characters.

This movie was awful. That's about the only way I can put it. I usually don't comment on movies, but seeing as how this one SOMEHOW got a 6.9 rating and a decent user review, I just had to speak up.Okay, here's the story.  Two brothers are driving cross country to pick up a girlfriend from college. On the way there, they pull a prank on a deranged truck driver and he comes after them.  SOMEHOW, this guy manages to follow them wherever they go, see everything they do, and know all their names.At one point he even takes time out of his busy trucking schedule to kidnap one of the character's friends from college.  He does this and still somehow manages to stay on the trail of the three kids driving back home.  Keep in mind, the guy has NO IDEA WHERE THESE KIDS ARE GOING. Correct me if I'm wrong, but after he loses sight of these kids in their car, wouldn't it be pretty much impossible for him to find them again?  Obviously the writers didn't think so.  So great are the truck drivers skillful deductions that randomly, out of nowhere, he finds out what hotel they're staying at, CALLS THEM UP AT THE HOTEL, and harasses them some more.The great part is that there's no explanation for how he does all this. It's not as if he turns out to be some supernatural all-knowing creature of the night or anything.  The story doesn't even hint that he might be.  No. He's a big fat stupid truck driver.To give the film some credit, Steve Zahn did what he could to bring some life into this awful, awful film.  His unique presence, along with gorgeous Leelee Sobieski were all that kept me from harming myself while watching this unoriginal heap of dung. This movie is terrible.

I must say I was impressed, and he doesn't do a bad job, convincingly dramatic in bits. He's hounded by his older, troubled, and immature brother, Fuller (Zahn, a great comedic asset to the movie) who keeps landing in the nick. This time, even he knows he gone too far, this prank may'be costing him the rest of his life. The psychotic trucker, who goes by the name of Rusty Nail, ends up basically playing a relentless stalking game, showing them, the much fatal error of their ways, after pranking them with a sexual rendezvous at this motel, the brothers stay at overnight. When you think about it, the brothers must of been pretty dumb to leave the c.b. in sight where Rusty Nail would of seen it, and added up the dots, although they weren't expecting him to be a nut, even though, he weirded out Walker in bits earlier, and he's quick, like a pussy, to ring the manager, when they hear a ruckus nextdoor, with Walker's character, looking worried or tense, even before that. while big brother is laughing his arse off. This movie than runs high on a good flow of suspense, and a bit of disturbing violence, has been well crafted, successfully terrifying viewer, with a great plot. Rusty Nail's intentions so clear, like Max Cady, he's gonna keep tormenting these people, where in 2002, I myself, dealt, with a similar situation, but on a much smaller scale. The performances are good, yes even Walker, Rusty Nail's voice, of course that of Ted 'Silence Of The Lambs', who also worked with Walker, in the first Fast And Furious, which Levine fits those terms definitely. The climax is intoxicatingly suspenseful, it's most richest, as if we've had so much tension and suspense already. The twist of ending reinforces the tragic error, their prank has cost them, where there's a message there too. A road movie better than you expect, and Dahl throws some nice shots in, one close up in slow motion, favouring girlfriend, Sobieski's goods. Her collegiate roommate, Bowman, mesmerizingly hot. Don't overlook it.

Ironically, I've seen both Steve Zahn and Paul Walker in other things and liked their work (especially Zahn's), so you'd think I'd want to see them in this! I saw the horrible sequel DEAD AHEAD first and I think that in part is what kept me from watching this original. But I forgot one thing...sequels are RARELY as good as the originals, if they are good at all! And, boy, is this original a keeper! JOY RIDE is a surprisingly scary (and funny!) psychological road film that gets off to a somewhat slow start with Lewis Thomas (Walker) about to embark on a road trip to pick up his girl Venna (Leelee Sobieski), but along the way he must bail his troublemaking older brother Fuller (Zahn) out of jail. Along the way, the Thomas boys play a CB prank on trucker named Rusty Nail and it backfires on them as it turns out Rusty is a certified loon! At first, I had a difficult time getting into the story as the first 30 minutes seemed to move at a snail's pace, but in reality, it is necessary to reel the viewer in with a calm start, then the explosion! From minute 31 on, pure entertainment! What surprised me most about JOY RIDE is that even though there are several cliché scenes and moment that one would expect in a movie like this, the result is anything but cliché! I found myself literally laughing out loud several times during the movie at genuinely funny human moments and interactions, like when the Sheriff went off on the brothers after their hotel prank on Nail. That monologue was genuinely humorous and the delivery by the actor was spot on! There was also a diner scene where the boys were forced to walk in in their birthday suits and the dialogue for the punchline was cliché as heck, but the timing and delivery of it by the waitress produced perhaps the most laugh-out loud moment of the film. I was amazed at how much attention to detail was given to the minor characters in the film and this helped me rate it so high! A lot of movies, even good ones, just dismiss their smaller roles and give them thankless lines, but this one treats all characters like REAL people! Zahn is quite frankly hilarious in this. He really shines several times in the film and has a great sense of comic timing, yet he still does a good job with the suspenseful moments as well. Walker was really good as well and conveyed a real sense of fear and dread of their tormentor Nail. Sobieski is surprisingly good and wasn't (as I expected) a distraction to the plot and had some really good lines and moments herself. And what really made Rusty Nail effective was using the voice of Ted Levine (the creepy Buffalo Bill from SOTL).JOY RIDE definitely pays direct homage to Steven Spielberg's masterful DUEL with the road chase scenes of Rusty's mammoth truck terrorizing the youngsters and him being an unseen presence for most of the film. There are also several eerie night time motel scenes that might just remind viewers of another little film called PSYCHO! If you're going to copy a formula into an effective thriller, those are the films to copy from. Highly recommended!

Yes, we do&#133; John Dahl's Road Kill is the greatest road-horror movie since The Hitcher and, purely talking in terms of psychopathic truckers, finally a worthy successor for Steven Spielberg's early 70's paranoid thriller Duel. The similarities in plot between this film and Duel are too obvious to be coincidental, but somehow Road Kill never feels like a shameless rip-off. It feels far more like a tasteful homage and, of course, a re-enactment with nowadays types of characters and more modern equipment and vehicles. Good-hearted college boy Lewis Thomas' plans to pick up almost-girlfriend Venna and drive from Colorado to New Jersey together are slightly hindered when he has to make an extra stop to bail his trouble-making brother Fuller out of jail. Fuller invites himself to tag along, installs an old-fashioned CB-radio in his brother's car and persuades Lewis' into pulling a cruel prank upon a lonely truck driver by the name of Rusty Nail. The joke severely backfires on them when Rusty turns out to be psychopathic freak who insists on washing away the humiliation through grueling payback. Lewis, Fuller and Venna are subsequently chased, terrorized and petrified by the unseen madman in his immense truck. The first half of the film is undoubtedly superior, since the trucker's acts of terror are plausible and far more unnerving because they all occur off-screen. In the film's absolute best sequence, Lewis and Fuller anxiously eavesdrop to how Rusty expresses his fury to the guest in the motel room next to them. This is a beautiful sample of suspenseful cinema, taking us right back to John Dahl's directorial heydays of Red Rock West and The Last Seduction. The second half of the film is still highly entertaining and adrenalin-rushing, but the plot-twists become slightly too far-fetched and Rusty's persona inevitably transforms into a stereotypical horror villain. All of a sudden Rusty seems to know everything, even the slightest details, about his preys and his massive truck pops out of nowhere everywhere, like it's an ordinarily compact Mini Cooper. Still, the fast-pacing remains constant and there's a formidably nail-biting climax scene. Dahl's regular cinematographer Jeffrey Jur marvelously depicts the remote routes and unappealing roadside motels and master-musician Marco Beltrami foresees an expedient and uncanny score. The acting performances are pretty good, especially considering the two main stars previously just starred in either lame comedies (Steve Zahn in Happy, Texas and Saving Silverman) or lame macho thrillers (Paul Walker in The Fast and the Furious and The Skulls). Leelee Sobieski's role is fairly redundant but she's terrific eye-candy, of course, and the attentive viewer will definitely recognize the voice of a legendary horror villain when hearing Rusty Nail speak.

On the way Lewis learns that his brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) has been arrested, Lewis bails him out & also offers him a lift home. As they pass the time they start to talk to truckers on a CB radio, Fuller goads Lewis into playing a practical joke on one such trucker who calls himself Rusty Nail. It all ends in tears as they send the trucker to a motel room supposedly to meet a woman but instead he finds a fat man who he rips the jaw off, Rusty Nail then sets out to get some revenge on Fuller & Lewis as he pursues them across the long isolated highways...Retitled Road Kill here in the UK because Joy Ride is an unpleasant term used over her to describe young people who steal cars for kicks & had various working titles including Candy Cane, Highway Horror & bizarrely Squelch, directed by John Dahl I thought this part thriller, part action, part road trip, part psychological horror flick was pretty good but not perfect. The script by J.J. Abrams & Clay Tarver has a good first hour which builds the story quite nicely but then it grinds to a halt & it becomes a teen road trip film for a while before an improbable ending. For a start you can see the similarities between Joy Ride & Steven Spielberg's classic Duel (1971) in the sense of an unknown psychopath in a huge truck menacing someone, this film doesn't really have the tight tension & narrative of Duel & the lack of any identity for Rusty Nail can be seen both bad & good depending on your viewpoint. The film also feels similar to The Hitcher (1986) on occasions, I suppose if your going to steal ideas you might as well steal them from the best. The character's are OK, the pace is erratic & I'd have liked it a little shorter, when all said & done not that much happens & if you think about it too much there's plenty of plot holes. For instance how did Rusty Nail know so much about Fuller & Lewis? How did he recover the CB radio? How could he know Lewis would find the CB radio in his car & talk to him before it blew it? How did Rusty Nail know they would take the highway where he had altered the signs? If you suspend your disbelief long enough I suppose there's a decent enough film here but I don't think it's one I'd want to watch again in any sort of hurry.Director Zahn does OK, the locations are suitably isolated & the widescreen image captures that isolation nicely. The film is quite tense at times especially at the end as Venna is tied to a chair with a shotgun pointing at her head the trigger of which is connected to the door so the instant anyone opens the door it will go off, there's some humour here as well & it's pretty engaging to. There isn't really any gore or violence so to speak which is obviously a disappointment. Jeepers Creepers (2001) came out the same year as Joy Ride & both are fairly similar as they feature kids in trouble on isolated roads although Jeepers Creepers is a better film.With a supposed budget of about $23,000,000 Joy ride had a much bigger budget than I had originally thought, it's well made for sure but I can't really see where all the money went as there are no big stars in it, there are no big action set-pieces or CGI computer effects. The acting is good, the character's are fairly likable.Joy Ride is a good film to watch, it has it's good moments for sure although there's some bad ones in there as well & if you think about it too much the story just doesn't hold up. Worth a watch for sure but maybe rent it or catch it on TV for free as a full blooded purchase isn't a good idea.

Yes, it would seem that originality wasn't high on director john Dahl's priority list when it came to making this film, although he does appear keen to buck as many clichés as possible, and the nail-biting tension that features often more than makes up for the lack of originality anyway. The plot focuses on Lewis; a young man travelling across the desert to meet up with his friend Venna. However, on the way to see her he ends up getting saddled with his prankster brother Fuller, and it's not long before the brother has bought a CB radio and is starting to wind up the local truck drivers. They come across a man calling himself 'Rusty Nail' on the CB, and after playing a prank on him, the pair find that the truck driver doesn't have a very keen sense of humour...There are some really great sequences in this film - from the many chase scenes, all the way down to the hectic and exciting climax - Roadkill is an entertaining thrill ride throughout. The plotting is surprisingly engrossing, as the film focuses on the two central characters for most of the running time, before shifting gears half way through and adding an extra character into the mix. The acting is superb considering the cast members. I saw Paul Walker for the first time in the lamentable thriller The Fast and the Furious - and he really shouldn't have made it, as the kid has talent and that is shown in this film, as well as in the surprise 2006 hit 'Running Scared'. Walker has great chemistry with the brash Steve Zahn, and the victim side of the cast is rounded off by Leelee Sobieski, who in fairness; doesn't have a lot of time to impress. The real standout, however, is Ted Levine, whose uncredited voice is that of the central villain. Overall, along with director John Dahl's previous films The Last Seduction and Rounders - Roadkill is a film that hasn't got the respect it deserves. Highly recommended!
