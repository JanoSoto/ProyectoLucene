It got better in the end when he figured it out because, I sure didn't. I didn't even remember that from the first time I saw it either. The parts that stuck with me all these years were those of the Angel (Emmanuelle Beart) I was completely taken in by her etherial beauty. I love the scenes in the forest with her and the animals. When she lights up, well, it's worth watching for the sight of her alone. She has a grace and innocent charm that suits her role perfectly. Delightful.Phoebe Cates plays Patti the hero's, fiancée and gives a great performance.Unfortunately, it's a very one dimensional role and does not put her in a good light. They (writers/directors) have given her no redeeming qualities. Personally, I think she's a lovely girl, but she's not at all in the same league as Ms. Beart.Our Hero, Jim (Michael E. Knight), rescues the Angel in distress and behaves like a true prince. He has much to deal with trying to do the right thing and has no one but himself to depend on.I suppose, it's very much like a modern (well '80's) fairy tale. But all the characters are very one dimensional. Simply uncomplicated. And about the comments on whether Angels can speak, well, who can argue?! I suppose there are Angels like Gabe, and Mike that are vocal messengers. But this Angel's task was not to bear a message, she was to bring solace, peace, if you will. I think her eyes and facial expressions spoke volumes and words alone could never convey the intensity and sensitivity of the situation.I gave this movie a 10/10 simply for the eye-candy.

After such a build-up during the penultimate scene, I was let down.Also wish we were allowed shorter reviews as in the past. It is difficult to come up with additional commentary when there wasn't much of value to view.

Don Ferguson, Beth Hogue, Tony Reitano, Leslie Norris, Thomas L. McIntyre, Eve Brent, Joe Herold, Mimi Green, Jerry Campbell. Director Tom McLoughlin...Screenplay Tom McLoughlin.Tom McLoughlin directed and wrote this little known romantic comic movie from 1987, one that is warm and magic but was overshadowed by the more A list and popular romantic comedy classics of the 80's such as the films of Molly Ringwald. Truth be told, you have to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this film about a guy and his feelings for an angel. Despite the appearance of an angel, this film has nothing to do with Christianity nor does it contain some moral message. It's pure comedy, pure romance, fantasy and 1980's memorabilia. When aspiring music composer Jim Sanders (Michael E. Knight) is taken away from his engagement party to Patty Winston (Phoebe Cates) by his friends, he has a drunken night of recklessness and discovers an angel has fallen into his pool. The angel (the beautiful French actress Emmanuelle Beart) is mute and speaks in a weird, unknown language, attracts forest animals and has divine powers such as the ability to emanate light, become invisible and fly. But her wings are broken and she is therefore vulnerable. Jim's friends seize the opportunity to expose the angel and profit off the controversy and publicity it would trigger. Soon, Jim finds himself running from these friends, from his jealous and enraged fiancée and from the authorities. This is not a complicated story nor does it offer any philosophy or questions the meaning of life despite the fact there's an angel in the movie. Don't expect something deep when it's simply a romantic comedy from about 20 years ago. Terrific script, cinematography with a dreamy look (by Alex Thompson) and a blend of 80's music and celestial-techno from Randy Kerber. Emmanuelle Beart is beautiful and even believable as an angel. The comedy style may go over the heads of today's young audiences but if you grew up in the 80's this comedy is sure to bring back memories. Funny are moments like when the angel learns to enjoy French fries/fast food, when the Love Beatle delivery boy does his thing and the many comic dialogues which come from almost everyone. Because of some language, because of sexual innuendo (though sex is never shown) and the fact that it's a romance about a guy who dumps a bitchy girlfriend for a hot angel, this movie should be viewed by older children and mature audiences, around the ages of 13 and up. It's not exactly a family movie as there are certain elements which classify this film as an adult romance. So take a trip back to the 80's and watch as an angel learns to love the human world.

Emmanuelle Beart as the angel is a perfect mixture of stunning beauty, and playful innocence, all expressed using only facial expressions, and soft birdlike cooing sounds. Whether gleefully snarfing french fries, or bringing down the wrath of god on her enemies,  she steals every scene she's in. It's easy to understand why everyone falls in love with her.Special effects are mainly limited to a set of beautiful articulated wings, and a lovely flying sequence are quite effective, especially considering the films small budget.Michael Knight holds up his end well enough, effectively likeable and sympathetic playing the standard befuddled hero caught in the middle. A shame we haven't seen more of him.The three actors playing Jim's friends just manage to miss being annoying. Fortunately their antics are tempered by the fact that they obviously seem to care about him, not to mention they have some genuinely funny lines.If there are any negatives to be found here, it's in the decidedly 'tacked on' ending. The original ending was supposedly quite lovely. Unfortunately some studio exec apparently decided it needed a 'happier' ending. Typical.Also, Phoebe Cates as the spoiled 'jealous girlfriend' quickly grows tiresome and starts to grate on the nerves with her tantrums and shrill screaming. I guess some might find this sort of thing funny, but I found myself fast forwarding through all of her scenes. A shame really since she's such a lovely actress. In spite of the gripes though this is a pleasant and sweet enough little movie for those who enjoy romantic fantasies.

However, Splash was a hit while Date With An Angel was a box office flop, and it's pretty easy to see why. Certainly, the fact that there were no big stars in the cast probably played a factor. But what really sinks the movie is how utterly stupid it is. The supporting characters (the fiancée, the future father-in-law, and the hero's buddies) are extreme stereotypes, and don't act in any believable way when they encounter the angel. The hero isn't fleshed out that much and comes across as a doofus. And while Emmanuelle Beart is beautiful, she is saddled in a role that has her character not only unable to speak English (until the last scene), but doesn't seem to understand English as well. As a result, the love that builds between the angel and the hero - the main drive of the movie - is completely unbelievable. The movie also has some unclear elements that suggest the original cut ran a lot longer and made more sense - a director's cut might fix that problem, but would probably bring in a lot more stupidity that would make the movie even harder to endure.

But then, the angel that was sent down to earth to take him collides with a satellite and lands in his pool, with a broken wing. It seems to be love at first sight for the angel when she first meets Jim, but problems arise when Jim's sleazy friends find out about her and deside to exploit her as a get-rich-quick sceme. Things get even worse when Patti sees the angel in Jim's apartment, concludes that he is cheating on her, and immediately wants to end the relationship. Now Jim must find some way to get Patti to understand while also protecting the angel from his own well-meaning friends. This film is well worth seeing for Beart (as the angel,) alone, although Micheal E. Knight as Jim and Phobe Cates as Patti also turn in nice performances. The angel herself never speaks, but instead makes cooing, purring sounds. Still, I was utterly charmed by Beart's performance, (who nine years later would play the female lead in the first MISSION IMPOSSIBLE feature length film,) and the film does have it's share of genuinely funny performances. The only really grating scene is one where Patti is visited by a paid love messenger dressed as a Love Bug. Fast forward through that scene. Otherwise, this is a warm, funny, enjoyable film, and a great companion piece with Splash.

DATE WITH AN ANGEL is one of those films that could easily be made into something much better. The opening and concluding scenes hint at the charming fantasy it could have been.  Unfortunately, to get from beginning to end you have to slog through everything in between.  The basic storyline isn't bad, although it could use a little reworking.  Michael E. Knight is OK as the would-be composer who wakes up after his bachelor party to find an injured angel in his pool. Emmanuelle Beart is appealing as the angel.  If you don't pay attention you might not notice that Phoebe Cates has the more striking features.  Phil Brock, Albert Macklin, and Peter Kowanko are sufficiently amusing as Knight's scheming buddies, and David Dukes is the stereotypical conniving businessman.The main problem with this movie is that it is populated by cardboard characters.  Once you learn their respective niches they follow true to form.  Phoebe Cates' talents are particularly wasted.  She starts out as a real person but soon devolves into an ultra-spoiled, gin-fueled, jealousy-crazed maniac.  I will say this for her, she gives it her all. The overacting is so pervasive (especially by Cates & Dukes) that I can't blame the actors.  I have to think that the director hoped intensity would make up for tissue-thin characterizations.  It doesn't.In short, the filmmakers should have toned down the gags and noise in order to give the actors some real acting to do.  I can't recommend DATE WITH AN ANGEL unless you are either a real fan of one of the actors or a sucker for romantic fantasy/comedies.  This isn't a terrible movie, but it is a pity to see talent wasted on a klunker that could have been a small gem.

If I could look like any actress on the planet it would be Phoebe Cates.  The dumbest thing to do was to cast Phoebe Cates as the third wheel in a fantasy romance.  The fantasy is not that there are angels (I believe there are), but that anyone engaged to Phoebe Cates would not devote one hundred per cent of his time to her...if Phoebe Cates is not an angel on earth, who is?  Michael Knight is handsome but stupid.  Part of the reason I watch Phoebe Cates films is to put myself in her place.  If I was in her place I would kick him to the curb.  Phoebe Cates is too stunning to be shelved temporarily either in a relationship or in a script.  The producers suspected this by casting (as a distraction) the wonderful French beauty Beart (of Manons in the Spring) in the angel role (sorry close, but no cigar).  Beart as an angel is no Roma Downey, in fact she can't even communicate!  Beart as a beauty is no Phoebe Cates.  So where do you go once this fatal error is fully entrenched?  No where.  Phoebe Cates as usual rises above the role connecting more with the audience than with her on-screen fiance Michael Knight (ooh hasn't his career blossomed). My suggestion  rent the film, leave the doomed romance between Beart and Knight to the fast forward button, laugh at the producers who put their money into the great stars Knight and Beart, and enjoy Phoebe Cates performance.  I think you have to be a Phoebe Cates fan to have any reason to rent this film.  I am her biggest fan.  If you are not a fan...yet...don't start with this film watch Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Drop Dead Fred, Paradise, Bodies Rest and Motion, even Gremlins 2.  All of her performances are gems, but caution  Date With An Angel is for experienced Phoebe fans only.

I think a lot of movie viewers miss the point when watching it I don't think the movie was made to rack up an Oscar...it was made as a light-hearted, family movie, viewed for the humor, romantic love, and lessons taught. As for Ms. Beart not having a speaking part (except for the French-accented nurse in the end), she does a wonderful job conveying emotions through facial expressions and gestures. The fact that she is breath-takingly beautiful did not hurt either. Phoebe Cates was hilarious, moving away from her goody-goody roles to portray the scorned woman. The frying-pan-catching-fire incident was a good comparison of her to the devil and Ms. Beart's angel, complete opposites. The three guys who portrayed Jim's friends were funny, each respectively. The dude with the spiky hair is fondly remembered as the spokes-guy for Jolt! cola. Anyone else remember that? The flying sequences reflected the special effects of that time (the 80's) and were not really all that impressive but the angel's wings were fabulous. How they got her wings to extend upwards as the character was bathing in the forest, while Jim filled in the peeping Tom requirements was interesting as well. I wish there was some behind the scenes information floating around out there in cyber space. If you wish to watch a light, fluffy movie with some solid values, humor, commradery, and romance, this one will take an hour and a half out of your day. I wore out my VCR tape and am looking to purchase the DVD when I have some spare change. Enjoy!
