He is the main reason for watching and carries the film on his sturdy shoulders, so adept is he at being a knight in shining armor.As for MEG RYAN, she is giving her usual Meg Ryan schtick--a sort of slightly brighter version of Goldie Hawn--but here it doesn't matter because Jackman manages to steal every scene he's in.  BRECKIN MEYER is excellent as her boorish brother who learns a few things from his 18th Century friend about manners and etiquette. But it's the time travel aspect of the story that is its weakest link.Highly recommended as a romantic comedy that owes much of its charm to the performance of its leading man--an actor of remarkable skill whose hunky presence dominates much of the movie.It's the sort of romantic fluff that would have starred JEAN ARTHUR and GARY COOPER had it been made in the '30s. The New York location photography is excellent.

Yet, I believe that it was HUGH JACKMAN who stole the show in this movie. He is so charming and charismatic that you can hardly resist falling head over heels for him! Leopold is a duke from the 18th century who mistakenly lands up in the 21st century one day...and is obviously bewildered with everything he sees. He stays with the man who got him there at the first place, Stuart,Kate's (Meg Ryan) ex-boyfriend. Predictably, Leopold falls in love with Kate and she retaliates. Yet, he has to go back where he came from, and that poses a problem for their relationship. It's a cute movie, yet, I couldn't agree with the ending, though it was predictable. I just couldn't see eye to eye with the reasoning they gave us for the step Kate took. Okay movie...great if you have nothing else to do and like chick-flicks. That's exactly the reason I watched it.

Woman and man see each other and don't like each other. Than they fall in love, but destiny comes in between them. In the end they overcome all problems and will live happily ever after...It's exactly the same as always, but this time they have added an interesting extra ingredient to it. Kate, her brother, her ex and Leopold all live in New York. The only problem is that Leopold is from the 1870's, while the others live in the 21st century. Kate's brother has found a way to travel through time, meets Leopold and accidentally takes him with him to the 21st century. I guess I don't have to explain everything that happens afterward...Even though I'm not always a huge fan of romantic comedies, I have to admit that I had a good time watching this one. Thanks to the original approach, this movie is better than average. The actors are convincing, although I was surprised to see how easily a man from the 19th century adapted to the 21st. It never really seemed a shocking experience to him. If I had directed the movie, I would have accentuated it more... But hey, if you can see past that and you are a romantic soul, I'm sure that you'll love this modern fairy tale. You know it's impossible, but you would like to believe it. I give it a 7/10 for that.

It's a fantasy which makes it your broccoli and spinach salad with cod liver oil dressing. So, please move on and let the rest of us enjoy it.This is not to say the movie is without flaws. It's got them. K&L has been out for a couple of years now and people still complain about Leopold's suit and plot holes and the supposed incest. Interestingly, when I first read a very early blurb about the movie it said that Leopold was from 200 years in the past, which would have put him in about the Regency era. The 200 years would have also pushed the 'incest' concern back another three or four generations. It would also have explained his Regency style getup. The folks who were doing the counting on this incest thing would have to have at least admitted that at 6 or 7 generations removed, Kate and Start would have only shared something like 1/138th blood. That's a bit less than the 1/4 it would be for second cousins marrying, etc. If you keep it at 100 or so years separation, it would still be around 1/16th shared blood. But even that kind of thinking means we're getting away from 'it's a fantasy, folks!'I have a few personal gripes about the movie. When it was out at the theater I saw it twice. Not a usual occurrence for me, even with Hugh Jackman's hunky persona. Frankly, during the first viewing, I could not get past Meg Ryan's hair. I was literally stunned by it. She's such a pretty woman, it amazes me that she thinks (or thought) that the Cookie the Clown haircut was cute. Not! Ms. Ryan, what were you thinking? Was this a mid-life crisis reaction?I've gotten used to Ms. Ryan's hair now and just don't see it anymore. But her performance, seemed to be Meg Ryan phoning is as Meg Ryan. Hugh Jackman was utterly charming as Leopold and so was the young actor who played Kate's brother. Some of their scenes together are the best in the movie.I though the use of profanity was overdone. My reaction is not out of prudishness (I can use the f-word and a heap of others when my car has a flat or won't start or I'm stuck in traffic, etc.) But it seems to me to lessen the authenticity of a character's intelligence. (Think about that the next time you overhear someone swearing continually in line at the grocery store.) It surprised me that Leopold didn't object to Kate's constant swearing (she was, after all, a lady) or that he didn't make a comment on it in general. I didn't feel he was reacting within the social attitudes of his own time. Even if it is a fantasy, he's not going to acclimate to our times all *that* quickly.I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so had no problem with the supposed 'incest' line. It's fantasy. And it's a paradox to begin with. During the time frame Stuart and Kate are in, Kate is NOT his several times removed great-grandmother. Think about *that* end of it.  So, shared blood aside, I can't say I'm sure who it was who was getting their knickers in a twist over that. That all said, it is a charming movie that could have been a blockbuster hit the likes of Sleepless but is not. I'm not sure where the fault lies in that. The Cookie the Clown haircut? Direction? The last minute/panic edit? Certainly in some of the writing. At this date none of that is going to change, so simply enjoy the movie for itself. There are far worse ways to spend two hours.(6/10)  "}{"Title":"Well Done !","Date":"5 May 2003","Score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  I must admit the characters in Kate & Leopold were superb.!

The further irony was that Leopold was discovered by another would-be inventor, played to disarming effect by Liev Schreiber - which is a far cry from Liev's chilling performance in the remake of The Manchurian Candidate - and he is also the benighted ex-lover of Meg Ryan (Kate).Liev's character finally gets her to accept they have drifted apart when he delivered a quiet yet massive insult - this movie thrives on intellectual innuendo and bravura, as opposed to bravado... Leopold does a remarkable adaptation to modern day conveniences, even re-inventing a timed toaster using a rubber band, timer and bent fork - a veritable 19th century MacGyver! The transplanted and trans-timed Duke does not realise how attached he got to Kate until he realised her boss was being less than a gentleman about her promotion. So Leopold educated her employer on the finer points of French, La Boheme and geography - without laying a finger he scalded the man! It really is a fantasy picture, she still had her job, LOL!!! However, for me the highlight is when Kate's purse is stolen near Central Park. The whole film shows how a man should treat a woman - and even better, they used Sting's Until which was inspired by the tragedy of 9-11... It is one of the most romantic songs ever and the film is a timeless classic on the whole!

It's clear that one shouldn't expect anything more than laughter and a few mushy moments of love from this film and that is the case. If one watches it with lower expectations, it can be quite enjoyable. I liked the Hugh Jackman - Meg Ryan pairing. They both share the required chemistry and provide some of the nicer moments. Ryan plays her usual romcom city lass persona (and I haven't tired myself from seeing her in such roles...yet but I now prefer to see her in different genres ). Hugh Jackman has a knack for comedy and he should do more such films if given a more intelligent script. Breckin Meyer and Liev Schreiber are great. To further prevent yourself from getting irritated, quit analyzing the film as there are several plot holes and some situations seem chopped. You can ask lots of question like how Leopold adapts to modern New York so quickly or how would an ultra-modern Kate (who's never travelled) make it in 30's (?) England (?) So one could enjoy it a little if they suspend their beliefs. even so, the ending seems a little too abrupt (predictable as it is). In spite of the flaws, there are the few nice moments and the few funny moments that don't make it all that bad.

Consider, for example, the scene early in the film, just after Stuart (Liev Schreiber) has accidentally brought Leopold (in a wonderful performance by Hugh Jackman) to the present day, and Kate (Meg Ryan) sticks her head in the window to see what's going on. When Meg Ryan is kneeling down and looking in the window in this scene, she is probably more adorable than I've ever seen her in any other movie, and she is without a doubt one of the most adorable actors working in Hollywood today. (spoilers) I can see that some people might be put off just by the sheer cuteness of things like this (of which the movie is full to the brim), as well as other things like the cheesiness of the conflict resolution, in which Kate literally takes a leap of faith off of the Brooklyn Bridge, with her ex-boyfriend as well as her brother urging her on even though each is fully aware that this will mean they will never see her again.For my own part, I think that minor quibbles like these are easy to overlook just because of the sheer entertainment value of the movie and the fact that the time travel element (something that almost never fails to enthrall me) is so intriguing and well done. I love the part at the end when they see Kate in one of the pictures that Stuart took in 1873, meaning that the resolution includes her being sent back to that time to be with Leopold. Stuart tries in vain to explain this to Charlie (Breckin Meyer), Kate's younger brother, telling him that since in THEIR future they send Kate back to the past, then the future of that past includes Kate being their and searching for Leopold. Well, I can't really explain it any better than Stuart did.There was one other thing about the time travel element that I thought was really interesting but wasn't explored as well as it could have been. There is a part of the movie where Leopold discovers, to all sorts of astonished amazement, that his uncle's house (his own residence in 1873) still stands even in the futuristic New York in which he finds himself. This is also, by the way, the point where Kate begins to realize that this whole thing might not be an act after all. Leopold runs upstairs and finds a secret hiding place where he kept all of his most treasured possessions, which still remain as dusty relics. Something like this is usually a signpost that it is going to come back into play at some later point in the film, but I guess here it is only meant to show Kate that Leopold is for real after all. Later in the film, when Leopold is sent back to his own time, I was expecting Kate to run up to that room in his house and open the cupboard and find some sort of note or something that Leopold left for her to find there, but no such luck. Ah well.As a romantic comedy, Kate & Leopold certainly has its shortcomings given it's conveniently packaged ending, the fact that so many things are ignored just to get to that happy ending (such as how Charlie's date REALLY went and what ever happened with him and his acting career and his love life, etc, and the same goes for Stuart), but as a film it is enormously entertaining, well-written, and thought-provoking, which is exceedingly uncommon for a romantic comedy. While it's true that the movie takes place mainly in society that can produce digital cameras the size of matchboxes but can't get toasters to work properly, this is the kind of movie that spawns discussion, which is what great movies do. If nothing else, it is most certainly an in-depth look at the descent of chauvinism between the 19th Century and today, and provides a host of immensely valuable lessons for how men should act around women. I would certainly like to see a lot of these behaviors return to our modern society, so that we can remember that life is not composed solely of tasks, but tastes as well. Kate & Leopold holds that rare distinction of being a romantic comedy that is more beneficial for men than women.Pay attention to this one, guys.

But unfortunately.. It wasn't ! I'm nuts about the main idea. (Hugh Jackman) here is kind of actual prince charming. He is also the elevator's inventor, so he has both heart and brains (and in Jackman's case muscles too). As for representing the lost romance and chivalry it's the perfect character, and when you push him into the future (aka  our world) then it's the perfect idea. However the world of this movie was very scanty.Mainly look at the dramatic conflict, in fact there isn't one ! Since (Meg Ryan)'s boyfriend left her from the start, so filling for the dashing, handsome, well-bred, mugger- chaser inventor would be not only easy but basically axiomatic. So, is it about the endless ironies between the old age and the new age's technology ? No, since the movie summarized it in brief sequence. So, is it about the deep irony between romantic age and phony materialistic one ? Maybe but they did it simply through the making of the TV commercial. It looked like another kind of angel-in-our-house movies where one visitor gives ultimate happiness to his troubled hosts then leaves. But did that fit whether the comic or the romantic part ?? I think wholly NOT.You'd feel hastiness. Although the main irony is super for sure but the movie's ironies weren't. The comedy was careless, I can't remember one good ironic situation. The dialog was a crime as totally unfunny and untalented, except for the monologue of (Liev Schreiber) at the hospital which was philosophically well put but surpassed anything had been written for any other character and just exposed with its high level all the low level of the rest of the dialog ! I didn't feel the love story between the title's characters, or the urge of that being impossible. All what was there just light touches that didn't convince me like the swift story of the unseen lonely neighbor, the love story of the lead's brother (that we witnessed on the phone ??), the concept of capturing the time or else, because this criminally remiss script just wasted it all. Look at what seemed as brilliant situations like the stopping of all the world's elevators, despite the imaginative spirit the script didn't go with it to anywhere so what about this unique romance between 2 persons from 2 ages?. Therefore the ending was too happy and too dreamy to fabricated extent without much of details or difficulties. So as a whole it went astray without strong feelings or good meanings. And the romance eventually looked superficial.Director (James Mangold) was executing a bland TV episode. I felt fake tenderness from him. Especially when the only romantic scene (the waltz) was just accumulated well-arranged shoots without effective sensations. Yes, the cinematography and the warm lighting were a bit emotional at that scene but the complete atmosphere was so unimpressionable.This can't compete with (Meg Ryan)'s nice legacy of romantic comedies. Originally it can't compete with the standard of its idea or even its own title as a movie about (Kate) and (Leopold) ! It was really ambitious one that promised something like what an old classic movie would present about memorable couple, but this movie delivered nothing.The 2 leads were like 2 clever dancers without music or a dance. It was pathetic to watch shinning stars like them, with possible chemistry into movie that's suffering of self-induced abortion ! In the case of (Jackman) the type of the role was attractive yet not the role in particular. (Ryan) didn't give us anything new since the script didn't give her anything ! It's the bad paradox of having productive people through unproductive work.I hated (Schreiber), despite whatever he could reach he got nothing to do with a romantic comedy, let alone being younger than (Meg Ryan). I hated dealing with Sting's masterpiece (Until) which had been nominated for an Oscar by putting it only at the closing credits plus not even using its fascinating tones into the movie's music score the way (John Williams) did in (Sabrina)'s soundtrack with another Sting's masterpiece (Moonlight). I liked (Meg)'s chic clothes, that was cuter than the movie itself ! I'm sad to say it but as a romantic comedy it lacks romance and comedy, or misses them. It was all out of keeping with Sting's (Until) which was more masterly than the whole thing. It's devastating to hear it and imagine a better movie for it !

Beach is far more eloquent (and kinder) than I can manage and I tried very hard to like this movie because I'm a sucker for romance, fantasy and sci-fi.Plot 19C Duke accidentally gets dragged into 21C New York, while there meets and woos modern woman over a weekend.Best portrayed character is the ex-boyfriend played by Liev Schreiber. Hugh Jackman *extremely* presentable and does his anachronistic best with poor dialogue and abysmal storyline. Meg Ryan let down by a badly thought-out script.* * * SPOILER(s) WARNING * * *Being a huge fan of costume dramas, and bearing in mind the popularity of recent adaptations of Empire novels (viz Pride & Prejudice, et al), I would expect the general public to be somewhat aware of the behaviour and attitudes of 19C women. We are supposed to believe that a late-19C Duke falls in love with a feisty, scarecrow-coiffured, in-your-face, ambitious, 21C career woman who seems to have sacrificed quite a lot already to get to where she is today.Just for a moment imagine the confusion and misunderstandings that may arise from a meeting between 19C and 21C people -- 1. Language is only the first hurdle - although the Duke seemed to pick up idiomatic modern-day English extremely quickly. 2. Modes of dress that would have been considered appropriate and modest in 19C are another - although kudos to the wardrobe dept which effectively bypassed the issue for most characters by using fairly generic, toned-down outfits. That Sgt. Pepper dig (included in the movie-trailer so no spoiler here) - well EXCUSE ME - had she LOOKED in the mirror? Apart from the heavy embroidery on his coat her attire was almost a duplicate of what he was wearing. The little black strappy number she wears for their romantic dinner would have been considered lingerie in his day - and being a Gentleman he would surely have offered her his overcoat.Eventually this open-minded, adventurous 19C aristocrat chooses NOT to remain in this future even though the invention for which he is credited had a working model already and could have been picked up by anyone. We already know he considers his 19C life to be empty and without purpose so why return?The 21C career woman, who has just been made a VP in her company, leaves all behind (except the designer dress she wears) to follow him into the past. Temporal Directive where are you now? Consider the personality of the character and imagine how much mayhem she would cause in the late 19C. Women's suffrage still had another 50 years to surface. Being fairly career-minded myself I find her abandonment of a lucrative company position in favour of relative obscurity so unlikely that my disbelief cannot be suspended and this ruined the movie for me. I found it to be an insult to independent women everywhere. And DON'T tell me she does it for 'l-o-v-e' which we all know is transitory.Previous updates mention that their union is supposed to ultimately result in ex-boyfriend Stuart's existence in the family tree - must have missed the reference in the movie.I would offer this rewrite of the ending - the Duke remains in the future with his soul-mate who continues in her extremely lucrative and successful career. He manages to overcome his distaste for being dishonest about the margarine (which he said tasted like SUET not SEWAGE - Closed Captioning editors please note) and becomes a successful TV model. Back in 19C the elevator idea is picked up by manservant/friend Otis - why else would it have his name on it? - a minor glitch in the scheme of the history books. Any votes?Sorry folks - unless you can tolerate the obvious mistakes, misogynistic writing and impossible-to-believe outcome this is a movie to miss. 2 out of 10 - only because Hugh Jackman is very pretty in it.

I never expect, or even desire, to be challenged--intellectually or emotionally--only to be entertained, and perhaps moved. You can call that lowering my expectations; I call it judging the movie on its own merits.Kate and Leopold has merit aplenty. It's charming, funny, entertaining--and even a little thought-provoking. It's nearly two hours in length--long for a film of this genre--but I never fidgeted or glanced at my watch. (Unlike my reaction to a recent over-hyped fantasy flick, which shall remain nameless. But I digress.) Kate and Leopold's strongest feature is a standout, charismatic turn by Hugh Jackman. He's a 19th century English Duke thrust suddenly into 21st century New York by a convenient plot twist...er, portal in the space-time continuum. He strikes a balance between the obvious fish-out-of-water predicament of his character and the requirements of a romantic lead who can capably, even masterfully, handle adverse situations. He cannot comprehend scooping up doggie doo, but he can chase down a purse-snatcher on horseback. Men watching this movie want to BE him, and women watching it want to be WITH him. Mark my words, the man is going to follow in the footsteps of his fellow countryman, Mel Gibson, to the top of the Hollywood heap in short order. The movie also benefits from a solid performance by Meg Ryan. Many people are dismissing her part in this movie as nothing more than a replay of her previous romantic roles, but she's brought a subtly different approach to this movie. She downplays the quirky, cutesy, girlish mannerisms she exhibited in When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle. Ryan's older now, and she wisely chooses to play her career-woman role as an adult...strong but vulnerable, cynical but hopeful, someone who's taken a few hard knocks that have made her cautious. I think she's grown as an actress--she seems to have recognized that Jackman's the main focus here, and generously allows him to shine.  Everything else--the secondary actors, the cinematography, the editing--all do a serviceable job of supporting the two leads while not distracting us from them.And, yeah, I found it a little thought-provoking. Nothing earth-shattering, I just walked out wondering if some 19th-century manners,  and due consideration of the fairer sex, might just be what we need right now. So I held the theatre door open for my wife on the way out, and opened her car door for her. I hope I do that stuff all the time anyway, but it just seemed a little more important after this movie. 8/10.

This review is not a genre hit piece, but an indictment of the themes of this particular film.The titulary Kate is one of the most regressive film heroines I have seen in recent years. Her exhaustion with her career and with modern life is a perfect example of what the current crop of feminist backlash thinkers would have you believe about the condition of American women today. Too bad for them, it's complete bunk. The idea that a successful, smart woman like Kate would jump back in time to an era where a woman's worth was completely dependent on her husband, and where enfranchisement was decades off, just to have someone make her toast with mascarpone for breakfast is offensive. And the idea of the modern American man as either a predator or a buffoon (or both, which J.J. is shown to be) is equally offensive.I could provide you a scene by scene academic analysis of how the film constructs these ideas, but an essay of that length is not possible in this forum. Instead I will say this if you decide to see this film, just keep these implications in mind. No film is simply a light, romantic comedy as some would have you believe Kate & Leopold is.

Bradley Whitford and, especially, Breckin Meyer save this movie from being completely blah. In fact, I would have liked to see a movie about Leopold and Charlie's friendship, actually.

While it's clear why Stuart tracks down Leo, and it make sense that he chases Stuart out of his house, but why does he then follow him all the way to the Brooklyn Bridge (saying stop, please, which was really odd) instead of sicking the cops on him?I also found it odd how quickly Leo adapts. He doesn't react with fear. He doesn't wonder if he will ever get home. He just complains about General Electric's toaster. It's highly unlikely he's encountered anyone outside his race or ethnicity. Yet, Leo not only accepts the sudden presence of Stuart's young friend (which is downright creepy), but spends the afternoon entertaining him. Why did Kate asking Leo if he's seen Breakfast at Tiffany's when she knows he hasn't? How did Leo pull off that rooftop dinner?And how cheeky to include Elisha Otis as a plot point. Stuart credits Leopold with inventing the elevator, yet it was invented by Otis (whose name Kate sees on her elevator and who is seen attending Leopold's party) way back in 1853!Then there's the lecture Leo gives about integrity.

I'm willing to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, so I can forgive all the time-travel questions this movie raises. Furthermore I'm used to movies portraying people as falling in love in less than a week and assuming that that is a solid basis for a lifelong marriage - so I can't really fault this film for that too.  My biggest problem was the way Meg Ryan's character was portrayed and how quickly she was able to throw away her entire life for some distant past that I don't think she quite appreciated what her new life would entail.  Why did people (both Leopold and her boss) accuse her of being manly and unfeminine?  Because she was assertive, good at her job, career-oriented?  I found this highly offensive! Furthermore, even accepting that she had fallen in love with someone (in a week!) and that she was not that interested in keeping her own life (w/ a promotion, the love of her brother, her friends, etc.) -- how on earth could she decide (in less than 23 minutes) to travel back to live in 1876? (without even hearing from Leopold on his thoughts on the matter!)  If she's thought to be unfeminine and manly in this day and age, can you imagine what it would've been like back then?  Has she considered whether being with Leopold is worth giving up her rights?  The right to vote, to wear pants, to work, etc. Were women at the time allowed to go outside unchaperoned, own property of any kind, even get divorces?  Did they still wear girdles and other sorts of insane fashions she will be expected to adopt?  I admit my knowledge of the past was sketchy, but I'd be worried about things like indoor plumbing, the state of medicine/hospitals at the time, etc.The false romanticization of the past is nauseating.  We're supposed to think it's better because men were more gentlemanly back then.  It's not impossible to find polite, well-behaved men in this day and age - who also agree with feminist principles!I could have handled the ending if he had come back to live with her in the present instead of her having to go back and give up her life for him.  It seems as if he would've adjusted better to today's society than she to his.

Basically in 1876, in the 19th Century, Prince Leopold Mountbatten, Duke of Albany (Hugh Jackman) is told by his strict Uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) to marry a rich American woman to help the depleting fortunes of his family. But then one day he spots out of place amateur physicist Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber) taking photographs, Stuart runs away during a speech at the Brooklyn Bridge, Leopold follows him as he prepares to jump from the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a time portal transporting them to 21st Century New York. Stuart explains to Leopold he found a gap in time that allowed him to travel to the past universe, he can only return to his original time when the gap opens again in a week, until then Leopold is stuck in the city, clueless about his new surroundings, and Stuart ends up having an accident and when talking about his scientific discovery being institutionalised. While staying at Stuart's apartment, Leopold is intrigued by cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, he sees she is a career woman as she does market research, she dismisses his kindness towards her, Leopold does however befriend Kate's brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer). Kate and Leopold do start to spend more time together, and slowly become romantically linked as she takes him on a tour of modern New York and they dine together, and Kate also thinks with 19th Century style clothes and perfect gentleman demeanour he could be the perfect spokesman for a new margarine product, an audition certainly proves successful. However when it comes to the day of the shooting the commercial Leopold is disgusted by the taste of the product, he cannot understand why Kate would endorse a flawed item to the public, Kate simply says that sometimes you have to do things you don't want to, they part ways for a while, and meanwhile Stuart breaks out of the the mental hospital, he transports Leopold back to his own. Kate is accepting a promotion that had always longed for, Stuart and Charlie show up at the banquet dinner and show Kate photographs from the 19th Century taken, Stuart thought he had disrupted the spacetime continuum, in fact Kate is supposed to go back to the 19th Century with Leopold, she is taken to the time portal just before it closes, as she chooses a life with Leopold over her career, she appears just as Leopold is about to marry Miss Tree (Kristen Schaal) for her family fortune, announcing herself as Leopold's bride-to-be, Kate and Leopold embrace, marry and live happily ever after. Also starring American Pie's Natasha Lyonne as Darci, Bradley Whitford as J.J. Camden, Spalding Gray as Dr. Geisler and Philip Bosco as Otis. Jackman is both funny and charming as the 19th Century gentleman transported into the modern world, Ryan being the of the queens of the rom-com genre does alright being beautiful with some feistiness, they are a relatively good couple, and the supporting cast members get their moments as well. The boy meets girl format is given a little twist with the time travel aspect, as is the English gent falling for American chick format, most of the film is predictable and old-fashioned, but you cannot help but laugh at the old-fashioned crossing with modern culture stuff, and the love story is sweet enough, a likable and not terrible romantic comedy.

Leopold, dashingly handsome 19th century Duke (Hugh Jackman) is (unwillingly) contemplating marriage. 21st century career woman Kate (Meg Ryan) is climbing the corporate ladder at an advertising company, whilst her love life is somewhat less successful. But time gets twisted when Kate's ex-boyfriend Stuart (Liev Schrieber) finds a portal into the 19th century - and after an ill-advised visit there, winds up bringing home an unexpected guest; Leopold, of course.Hijinks ensue as the gentlemanly and courageous Leopold navigates his way through 21st century New York, befriending Kate's brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer) and beginning a romance with Kate. And of course all ends happily in the end. I'll start with the good stuff Jackman is absolutely charming, playing it straight as the fish-miles-inland-never-mind-out-of-water and succeeding admirably. You can't help but love him and believe in him. Breckin Meyer does nicely in a supporting role. Schrieber is essentially a plot device to move the story forward, but gets a few comic and touching moments that a less talented actor might have let fall by the wayside.And what about our other romantic lead? >Sigh< I've never been a fan of Meg Ryan, but I'll try and be fair as possible. But to be honest, I didn't warm at all to her character. I get that Kate is a driven career woman, but what a high price she pays for it. You're like a man her boss says approvingly (huh?) but she isn't - she simply comes across as a bitchy, bad-tempered and cold woman (guess I'm losing the fairness battle) and to be honest, doesn't stand a chance in the popularity battle with Jackman's Leopold. And then she tosses her career away for a happy ending with her Duke, marriage and setting up a 19th century home.

He is being forced into this marriage because she is very wealthy and Leopold's family finances have been depleted in recent years.On the night Leopold is to be married, he spots a man using a digital camera. Fascinated by him, he follows him to the Brooklyn Bridge where he is about to jump off. Leopold tries to save him, and as they fall, they are both swallowed up by a time portal. The two arrive in 21st Century New York.It turns out the man Leopold followed was an inventor called Stuart (Liev Schreiber). He recently discovered the time portal at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge, and used it to travel back in time to the 19th Century. For the time being, Leopold is stuck in 2001 because the time portal won't reappear for at least a week.Removing Leopold from his own time has consequences. Leopold would go on to invent the elevator, and now all the lifts in New York are on the blink. Stuart has an accident in one of them, leaving Leopold to fend for himself.It's not long before Leopold runs into Stuart's ex-girlfriend Kate McKay (Meg Ryan) who lives in the flat upstairs. Kate is not sure what to make of Leopold, and sort of adopts him. This sets in motion a chain of events for these two disparate souls.In this film, Meg Ryan reminds me of Ally McBeal. In fact, a lot of the plot developments in Kate & Leopold are right out of an episode of Ally McBeal. Two very mixed up women who have a string of unsuccessful men in their lives. Leopold is just one of the stranger men to enter the life of Kate.Leopold is astonished by the advances made throughout the years, but amusingly, he's more astounded by the cynical attitudes and bad manners of the people of the 21st Century.By comparison, Leopold is a model of decency and respectability. His sense of chivalry and gentleman civility begins to win over Kate. She even thinks Leopold would make a perfect spokesperson for a new type of butter her company is looking to advertise. And her idea works. Until he realises how awful it tastes, and when Kate sees no problem with advertising a disgusting product, Leopold realises he must return to his own time.Hugh Jackman gives an outstanding performance, showing how broad his range as an actor is. He is completely different from Wolverine in X-Men, and he can also do a pretty decent English accent. He would be perfect as the next James Bond.Although Jackman and Ryan don't have sizzling chemistry, they do make an amiable couple. There are plenty of nice touches, such as Leopold rising from the table whenever Kate is about to get up, or modifying a toaster to get it to work the way he thinks it should.Meg Ryan is fairly overshadowed by Hugh Jackman. In fact, it's easy to forget about the other characters whenever Leopold is around. He manages to steal every scene he's in, and what makes it so satisfying, he does it with good-natured humility instead of overacting.A lot of the things that Leopold says about how the world has become too cynical and deceitful for it's own good makes a lot of sense actually. It is exactly for this reason Leopold realises he has no place in Kate's world.As it gets towards the end, it starts to feel like Back to the Future. Kate wants to follow Leopold back to his own time, which she does. The truth is, the ending is unbelievable. Although I did enjoy this film, I couldn't buy for a second that Kate would leave everything behind to join Leopold in 1876. That's just the cynic in me talking.Aside from the ridiculous ending, Kate & Leopold is a very appealing romantic comedy. Although I did want to know what was up with Meg Ryan's hair. God it's a mess in this film. And we get her obligatory yes, yes, yes!!! sequence. Good on you Meg!

He's charming, kind, good looking! has near perfect manners, and is simply wonderful. The romance is great, I love the chivalry of Leopold. There is a slight flaw in the movie, with the whole time travel thing. When Leopold came forward, all the elevators stopped working because he was no longer in the past to invent them. However, when Stuart brought Leopold forward in the future, Stuart looked up in a history book, and found an article about Leopold, Duke of Albany, inventor of the elevator Shouldn't that have been changed too ?Nevertheless, I do love this film and recommend it to those who love romance, and comedy.

Anyone who thinks that its time travel pretext has anything to do with science fiction is missing the point.  The idea of the movie is that there is something that the last century has to tell us about things worth living.But the problem is, that thing retrieved whole from the time gone by is British aristocracy, as arrogant today as it was two centuries ago, and just as irrelevant.  The nice little sequence in the film that refers to the marriage of Di and Charles glosses over that subject completely, amazingly, in the context of the film.Still, the extant Duke of Albany seems credible in the context of modern Manhattan, and not only by his brilliant performance, but within the simple and even naive plot constructed around him.  We are to believe, for example, that this uneducated man (in modern terms) can convince a Manhattan carriageman to surrender his horse to pursue a street thief.Nor does he ever seem to need any money.  But these are just minor quibblings, and this is only a movie, and a romantic comedy at that. Reality needs no specific address here.But the beautiful thing, the thing that makes this a compelling little movie is its conclusion, the thing you want, where the boy and girl end up happily married ever after, and we don't even know what ever after was, although we are tempted by a plot item that names Leopold as the inventor of the Otis elevator (named after his butler)  I have no idea if any of this has any basis in reality but I was charmed nonetheless.Furthermore, there have been comments, I am sure repeated by the general critical establishment that Meg Ryan has passed her prime, but as what, a pretty face?  She remains a superb representation of feminity in the late 20th century.  And if she does not go beyond to other roles (although I suspect she will) she will still always hold that position.  There are few others to challenge her.  And besides, she's still gorgeous.  Funny and smart as well.

His recent body of work has proven him to be a very versatile actor and I thought he was very good in this film.  The story of his character has been told before, but Jackman made it extremely interesting, here.  There were even some fine non-Jackman moments, too.  The scene in which Liev Schreiber compared his discovery of the time portal to that of a dog seeing a rainbow was outstanding, as was the scene where Brecken Meyer finally mustered up the courage to call his dream-girl.  The audience could really feel the emotions of the moment, which is the ulimate goal of any actor.Despite the good qualities of this film, it is seriously flawed.  Notice that none of these elements include Meg Ryan.  I'm sorry, but this is the exact same character she has played for the past 15 years.  Nowadays, the cute-as-a-button, girl-nextdoor clearly has more than a few miles on her and the act is starting to wear a bit thin.  Also, the movie really started to drag.Nevertheless, I came to despise this movie because I realized that it is a perfect example of the holier-than-thou/do-as-I-say-but-not-as-I-do hypocrisy that we get from Hollywood all of the time. Last summer, Babra Striesand tells us in California that we need to conserve energy and hang our clothes out to dry, all the while her spokesperson acknowledged that she didn't mean that this applied to her.  Rosie O'Donnell preaches to us about the evils of gun ownership while she shills for K-Mart (one of the largest sellers of firearms in the country) and hires an armed bodyguard to watch her kid.  Or the many, many tv stars who tape the public service spots telling us how to raise our kids while not having any kids of their own OR leaving theirs with the help.  It is all pure hypocrisy. By now, I have no doubt lost you, but please stay with me.  You see, the message of this film was that we should have integrity and stay true to our vision.  Focus groups, polling and selling-out are terrible, terrible things because they cause us to stray from this vision, yet that is EXACTLY what the makers of this film did.  Here are some examples of scenes that were cut from the film just a few days before the release based on, you guessed it, data compiled from test audiences (AKA focus groups)**References suggesting that Kate has a genetic relationship to Stuart. (Audiences were uncomfortable with the fact that their romance was incestuous, even if only in a roundabout sort of way.)**A scene were Ryan appears in the background of a 19th century party.**A cameo by director James Mangold where he plays a director whose film is being changed to meet the demands of a test screening.  (After all, they were directly insulting the test audience!)Do you get it now?  After making a film that preaches to us about the evils of not staying true to your vision and pursuing the almight dollar, the producers assumed that their own sermon didn't apply to them. Typical Hollywood hypocrisy.

A good role, but overdone.  I haven't seen Signs of Life yet, so that may change my mind.  The main problem I had was in the continuity of the film.  James Mangold says in the commentary on the DVD that he did not want to confuse the audience with the Sci-Fi aspects of time travel, so he didn't spend a lot of time trying to explain it.  That's all well and good, but you need to think through it yourself before putting it into a movie.  It is central to the plot of the movie!  Without the time travel, Kate and Leopold never meet.  If they never meet, then there is no story!  How can Kate be in pictures taken by Stuart if she doesn't arrive in the past until after Stuart leaves the past?????  Why would a nurse risk her job and let Stuart out of the hospital over his dog and rainbow speech????  It was pretty lame (imaginative but not very coherent).Even if he didn't want to explain every nuance of time travel to his audience, Mr. Mangold should have thought through the specifics himself.  Maybe he didn't try to explain because he didn't get it himself?Anyway, a good romantic rental, but don't expect too much.

The funny thing is, when I stepped out of the theater, I also had a very high respect for Hugh Jackman as well. Throughout the whole movie, Jackman's portrayal of Leopold was charming, romantic, and politely witty. I believe that he was perfect for this role. Kate McKay is an executive at a marketing agency who is always busy with something, whether it's work, or the attempt to get over the loss of her long-term boyfriend, Stuart. When Stuart finds a time portal into the past, he has a chance to see things as they were in New York City 200 years ago. On one of his journeys back in time, he accidentally brings back a royal Duke from 1876 named Leopold. Unfortunately, Stuart falls down an elevator shaft and is laid up in the hospital. Now, Leopold has to get familiar with his new and strange surroundings alone. While doing so, he meets Kate's brother, Charlie, who helps him realize that his feelings for Kate are more then just ones of friends. After Leopold understands that his feelings for Kate are stronger than he had realized, the real love story begins. The sparks fly between the two until Stuart returns home and insists that Leopold returns back to where he came from. This movie has the perfect blend of every emotion. I laughed, I cried, and I was touched so deeply, because as the tagline says they are perfect for each other. I suggest seeing this movie.

Leopold's disaffection for the status quo in 1876 makes headway, but is unable to save this mess from 'death by chick flick.'  I felt embarrassment for those involved with this attempt.  The heavy pre release advertising only confirms that the studio knows they are not going to be getting any positive word of mouth.Meg Ryan plays Meg Ryan with all the skill and diversity of Freddie Prinz Jr.  It was painful to watch her scenes.  Hugh Jackman does well playing the stock character of Leopold, but it was too predictable and flat of a story for any real performing.  Breckin Meyer as Charlie the brother of Kate, was the one supporting character that saved it from being a total bomb.  His scenes, and those of Roebling's mighty erection are about the only worth while parts of the flick.  Natasha Lyonne did well as Kate's lackey assistant Darci, and almost seemed as desperate to prop up this flick as to prop up her boss.Do not waste your time or money on this!*It is very unusual to alter a movie AFTER it has been publicly viewed.  They are taking out the ancestor connection between Stuart and Leopold, so that Stuart didn't date his great great grandmother for 4 years.

Which, in my opinion, was not suited for her. I will also disagree that Meg Ryan has lost her appeal from being type casted. I believe that if this type of role suits her, then as long as an audience can be comfortable with that role and not be annoyed by her casting being a sore thumb, then I will enjoy her performance.All in all, a wonderful film.Leo "}{"Title":"The Boy From Oz Excels Again","Date":"1 December 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" For any fan of Hugh Jackman, I definitely suggest this funny, romantic and well-thought movie. Some people may disregard it for its predictability but isn't that the case for any romance movie? Meg Ryan, perhaps, is getting too old for such a role but her performance was still of a high standard that I really enjoyed. Liev Schreiber was also superb and I loved his comic take on his role; purposeful or by accident. Also, as Meg Ryan's almost there actor brother, Breckin Meyer also excelled- and possibly needed more screen time. However, if there was any downside to this movie, it would certainly be the lack of detail concerning the whole time travel idea on which the whole movie rests upon. This aside, Kate and Leopold is yet another fantastic Hugh Jackman movie for fans of both romantic comedies and the gorgeous Australian actor.Although, for those few people out there who turn their noses up at a light, enjoyable movie- I direct this to you. A movie is a movie, and in most cases a movie is made purely to entertain; rarely concealing a deeper meaning or whatever some of you may be looking for. As for the entertainment side of things; I honestly find it fantastic and a great movie to sit down and watch on one of those days P. Oh! And for those who, quite bizarrely, refused to enjoy simple because of the casting- Hugh Jackman was superb, as was every other actor in this movie regardless of screen time (my only exception being Liev Schreiber).Lastly, just on a happy note- Kate and Leopold, although you may not like to admit it, is just one of those movies that gets better and better every time you see it; so why not rent it out and see for yourself D "},{"Title":"Cute, light, fluffy","Date":"5 February 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" Cute, light, fluffy.

Both Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman are good actors and are entertaining as a couple with fairly decent chemistry. The plot is fairly ludicrous, but the on-screen romance is fun.

No, it's not Great Cinema but it's also not garbage... as so much is, stuff that plays to the lowest common denominator, sight gags, slapstick, bathroom humor. None of that. It was funny, it was witty, the acting was good, the actors did a decent job, and it's a great date movie or something that you know will end well.I realize there is a movement to have all movies end badly, since life ends badly and movies should therefore reflect life. Rubbish. There's enough stress in life; we don't have to have it in all of our entertainment -- I don't find stress entertaining. Something more realistic may be educational (for example, anything by Michael Moore is excellent and I can't wait to see his newest, just released) but I don't classify it as entertainment -- I class it as educational satire frightening (when you see the facts, you get scared for the future of this country) but you see what I mean. Kate and Leopold was fun.. it deserves a higher average score than that which it has been given thus far. There are so many BIG budget garbage movies that rely solely on special effects and are considered great and fantastic -- this movie relied on acting.It's like the difference between a Sidney Sheldon or similar garbage novel -- what's her name, the woman who writes all those horrible romance type novels.. that sort of thing is NOT entertainment because it's so poorly done.. ah, Danielle Steele -- that's truly trash. This movie ISN'T the cinematic equivalent of Danielle Steele, it's far better than that. It's not the Jane Austen either -- lol, but it's between the two. Good, fun, well-acted, not trash, enjoyable entertainment.And that's all it purported to be. And so, on that basis, I give it a high score. It's not pretentious, it's not trash, the acting is good.. what's NOT to like? If you're judging it on the basis of superb realistic cinema then of course, you'll grade it low. Or if you're looking for explosions and stupidity, then you'll grade it low because you won't get it. But if you understand that it's simply an enjoyable, but well-done, piece of romantic comedy, meant to relieve us of stress for a couple of hours, and make us smile, then you'll get it, and enjoy it.. we need more movies that are not trash, that are decently well acted, and that are lots of fun.Hmmm.. speaking of Meg Ryan, did anyone catch a film in which she acted OUT of her usual type-cast... she was an angry woman, because her French lover had basically used her to get his papers to stay in the country.. she appeared in it with Matthew Broderick... ADDICTED TO LOVE. Now THAT was hysterically funny.If you want to see Meg Ryan in a completely different sort of role, and really funny, you'll like that one. It too is intelligent and fun cinema.. also romantic comedy, but with more of a dramatic edge to it.

They didn't even capitalize much on the fish-out-of-water angle.  It seemed like no time before Leopold was comfortable using the toaster and the telephone and wearing modern clothes.Why did they bother?  Out of sheer desperation to try to inject this run-of-the-mill, chemistry-free, Julia Roberts reject of a vehicle with a little pizzazz, but to no avail.  Take away jumping off the bridge and you've got Sleepless with the Duke of Albany.  Meg Ryan is getting a little long in the tooth to keep on playing the ditsy ingenue who needs to be told by a strong man that deep down she really does want love over independence.

There are also a couple of great supporting characters, mainly Stuart and Charlie. I particulary liked Leopold's giving Charlie courting advice and Stuart's speech about the dog finding a rainbow. But there were a couple of really, really huge problems. The first is Meg Ryan's character. For about the first half of the film she is incredibly bitchy and annoying, and then all of a sudden she is sugary sweet and cutesy enough to make you want to throw up. Still, I kind of went along with the romance, mainly because of Jackman...and then the second big problem comes into play - the ending. Why would any woman in her right mind willingly travel back to a period when women had absolutely no rights? I know, I know, it's a romantic comedy, there has to be a happy ending or there will be rioting in the theaters (although I think a bittersweet ending would have worked fine), but couldn't the writers have found another way to achieve it that wouldn't send such an awful message? After Kate traveled back to the past, couldn't the two of them have traveled back to the future together before the porthole closed? Leopold seemed happier in modern New York anyway, and Kate could have solved her unhappiness on the job by finding a more fulfilling career.

Mr. Mangold proves he has what it takes to make it in Hollywood as he demonstrated before in the independent film circuit.This is a story of discoveries.

If they are not very sophisticated, this clunker of a movie may actually meet their expectations. For the rest of us, disappointment is what awaits us.What ruins a movie like this for me is the implausibility of the lead male actor falling in love with the female lead actor. The attraction is cloyingly forced. It's not believable, and that is just the kiss of death for the viewer who is too many times asked to suspend disbelief. If we don't believe in the attraction between the co-stars, the movie fails.This plot failure is what ruined the Freddie Prinz movie, She All That. Just as Meg Ryan's character couldn't possibly attract Leopold, Rachel Leigh Cook was so bristlingly unpleasant that Freddie Prinze's love interest in her is absurd. You can practically see the script being read out loud.Leopold (Hugh Jackman) plays a nineteenth century nobleman and inventor who gets transported to the 21st century. For some inexplicable reason, he takes a romantic interest in the very modernized, workaholic, stressed-out Kate (Meg Ryan). Perhaps Kate's modernity and sassy ways could initially be of some transitory curiosity to the refined Leopold, but a romantic attraction is more than I could force myself to believe.To be blunt, Kate is not exactly a prize. To be even more frank, Meg Ryan does not look very good in this movie. Add to this the fact that her character doesn't have that many good personal qualities (etiquette, grooming, taste, style, manners, etc.), and our ability to accept the implausible is stretched too thin.It's not until you've seen a movie like this that you appreciate how good other concept movies are. The Butterfly Effect with Ashton Kutcher is an outstanding movie that has to do with traveling through time.Travelling through time? Kate & Leopold just plods along, and wastes our time. . . . **Addition added January 16, 2009** I first started writing these reviews in 2005.

At least this is better than his previous Hollywood forays.Poor Liev Schreiber only gets one good speech, and he does it quite well. Meg is Meg (though one would have thought her character could have handled sexual harassment better).Here's the buts -- Happy Accidents is a similar and much better movie. Advertising and market research is a hackneyed target for criticism of the modern world. Jack Finney's Time and Again (and almost any of his tales) are a similar and much better story -- and far more historically accurate. I had to keep wincing on how the mattes and the editing got both old and new New York all wrong, even mixing up Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights, Downtown and Uptown, as if Madison Avenue was just off the Brooklyn Bridge. Funny how modern times bothered the Duke -- but not modern women's slight clothing or sexual mores, though the sex is off-screen (I expect Kate would be more bothered by 1876 plumbing and pre-feminism). And that's after the director edited out the implausibilities that the critics plotzed about at the previews or dealing with when La Boheme or Pirates of Penzance were first performed.Not only are the music selections not special, but it oddly relies on Henry Mancini's Moon River theme from Breakfast at Tiffanys to put the two characters in the mood - what does that have to do with a 19th century duke? If you can keep silly common sense out of your head, the movie is a sweet chick flick.(originally written 12/29/2001) "},{"Title":"Meg should throw in the towel","Date":"4 January 2002","Score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  Meg Ryan in a romantic comedy?

Successful woman really just want to be wined and dined and travel back in time to where they had no rights to vote, work, own property, smoke in public, drink at all or even open up their mouths to say 'no' - even if they did, their husbands had the legal, yes legal, right to beat them in public.

The cliches are a-flyin' here people more fast and furious than room full of brides-to-be running through a bridal store going-out-of-buisness sale.  Brecken Meyer is good, Liev Schrieber is solid, Jackman is on the ball and the best part of this movie, and poor Meg looks like she left half her body wieght back in South America on the POL set. She has done this so many times before, even SHE looks bored to death. The historical inaccuracies are laughable because they are so easy to research and correct.  Doesn't look like a lot of thought was put into this puppy, I am sad to say.  How modern woman can watch this and walk away with a feel good glow is hard to understand.  Why you ask? Because I find the idea of a modern woman throwing away all that her fellow women in the past fought for just to have a man a sad premise to build a rom-com on.

No the plot is not fantastic. But what romcom is? We don't watch them because they are so fabulously written (maybe with a few notable exceptions). We watch them because they make us happy.

When I say that other romantic comedies are unrealistic, I find it annoying that many of them at least act as though they are depicting the lives of normal humans and fail miserably. This film does not pretend to be anything it's not. It's unrealistic because it contains time travel, an idea which is actually refreshingly original. The charm of the movie is further amplified by Hugh Jackman's phenomenal acting. I love a good story about someone who time travels and has to adjust to a new time.

He is bewildered until he meets the stranger played by Liev Schreiber who is an inventor, and his ex-girlfriend played by Meg Ryan. Though it makes little sense even for the stretch of the imagination, it is an interesting choice for director James Mangold who previously made Cop Land and the overrated Girl Interrupted. Mangold counters the preposterous elements of the story by concentrating of characters with likable qualities. Jackman is charming as he tries to relate to present day culture. Ryan is smart and witty as Kate who is curious with regards to Leopold but is heading to an ending that is hardly satisfactory. Schreiber rises above the nonsense of the plot with humour in tact although how he created the portal is a rather dim plot device. Breckin Meyer steals scenes as Ryan's actor brother who learns much from Leopold particularly about romancing a female he is interested in.

The second, and more troubling in that it is unnecessary, is the plot point concerning the discussion of music. La Boheme While the script did, before the end of the scene catch the import of the language of the opera being in Italian, though set in France, it did not take into account that the opera was not written until 20 years after (1896) Leopold's journey into the future. In addition, there was a discussion of Pirates of Penzance as well - - with Leopold familiar enough to play the accompaniment on piano while he and Charlie are singing Model Major General. Leopold is supposed to have jumped in 1876 - - and Penzance did not premiere until 1879.Finally, the perfection of the modern elevator by Elijah Otis was in 1852 - not sometime after 1876 as implied in the movie - - and by that time, the concept would have been well known.

Charlie tries his best to amuse the ladies, getting nowhere, while Leopold just sits there being the strong, silent type. Later, as they are walking home, Leopold tells Charlie that he is a Merry Andrew, a clown, and that is why he gets nowhere with women.Now, I guarantee you that if Leopold had acted like a Merry Andrew, and Charlie had just sat there being silent, it would still have been Leopold whom the women were wanting. In fact, the movie might have been more interesting had the actors switched parts. If Charlie had been tall and good looking, but was a flop with the ladies, while Leopold had been a funny-looking little-guy who succeeded with women on account of his Victorian manners and aristocratic demeanor, then that might have been interesting.

The fun of this movie is taking classic and modern archetypes and turning them on their heads. Leopold (Jackman) is an aristocrat but one with a passion for science. He seeks to break free from the constraints of societal conventions in 19th century New York. Meanwhile, Kate (Meg Ryan) has pushed to break out from traditional female roles. As her boss J.J. (Bradley Whitford) comments, You're a rarity among women, Kate. You don't cling to illusion. You don't get caught up in emotion. You don't do pretty. You skew male. You're like a man. A man who understands women - their desires, their needs. You understand them but you're not really one of them. Some people may need to justify a romantic comedy in order to give it value. If that is the case, note that this story is about two people who are struggling with conventions and have lost their own identities in the process. Flailing at opposite ends of the spectrum, Kate provides Leopold with the inspiration to break from conventions and be true to himself while Leopold provides Kate with the safety and security to allow her guard down and be true to her own femininity. There is a greater thematic meaning to this film beyond simple love. It is about the pressures of society, how success can seem tied to having to conform to societal conventions, how we lose ourselves in the pressure and how relationships with others can ground us and help us find ourselves amidst the mêlée of societal forces.Although the story of Kate & Leopold's romance is the center of the film, it is not the only relationship which provides a grounding force. Kate's relationship with her upstairs neighbor and former beau, Stuart, who remains an intimate friend despite her bitterness and her relationship with her brother, Charlie, provide her with the strength to face the unknown and the security to take a chance on love. For Leopold, it is his manservant, Otis, who plays the role of father while Charlie and Stuart are also renewed in their relationship with Leopold. Surely, this is not just a romantic comedy but a story about the relationships in our lives and struggles against societal conventions.The highest praise I can give this movie is that I purchased it - a rare occurrence. I do not see the point of owning something unless I am willing to watch it many times over. It was the first and one of 6 movies I own.Hugh Jackman's acting is charming, sincere and genuine. My reaction was Wow! What a great actor. He made it easy to believe in his character.Sometimes I find Meg Ryan a bit rough but that was the purpose of her tough, manly facade. This is what makes the moments she lets her guard down and becomes a woman so special.Enjoy it as a fun love story or listen to the deeper themes of integrity and compassion. Either way... the cinematography is gorgeous, particularly as it juxtaposes new and old New York; the costumes are delightful; the music is passionate.One warning - BYPASS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. It muddles the story with a bizarre choice of familial intertwining. I watched it once with someone who had never seen the theatrical version - yuck! It spoiled the movie for me and the other person missed the magic of the original cut. STICK TO THE ORIGINAL.

The woman she's playing is nosy, rude, aggressive and rather hysterical. Not even a hint of grace or loveliness about her. I think the reaction of a true gentleman for such unwomanly woman would have been contempt (or even pity), rather than falling for such a witch. On top of that, Kate's wardrobe is appalling. OK, she's supposed to be a non-feminine type, but this does not mean that she has to dress like a nun (always dark colours and horrendous white shirts). Even the gown she wear at the end is depressingly grey. Was this woman also supposed to be colour blind? Finally those straight limp strands forever falling on her face drag her features down, making her seem older. I usually enjoy Meg's movies (also the serious ones, like Flesh and blood) but this one was a flat-out, predictable, disappointing movie. If you enjoy Meg's comedies, watch You've got mail, Sleepless in Seattle or When Harry met Sally instead, or my very favourite Addicted to love, where she's also playing a character more sour than her usual ones, but at least one with some sense of humour and a GREAT wardrobe.

What a found was an extremely enchanting modern day fairy tale. Basic elements of romanticism and 'family' were enhanced through the supernatural aspects of the film, which is something I find rare. Common themes, such as finding yourself within another and thinking outside of the norm, were certainly uniquely displayed within the film. I'm not suggesting this title is for everyone.

I loved this time-travel idea and it's proof that this can be done without making any of the characters look overly stupid.Hugh Jackman is charming (dashing?) in the role of the perfect gentleman (Leopold) that i think most women still wish to meet. Meg Ryan is re-doing her single woman looking for the right man and needs a better hairdo, but she plays Kate well. However, it took the excellent chemistry between these two, the well-written parts of the other actors, and comedy to make this movie superb!Leopold falls for Kate while winning her love through his good manners and proper courting. I especially love the part where Leopold says, . . . that love is a leap but I sadly have never been inclined to jump. (If that's not a direct quote, it's awfully close.)However, there is a point that you honestly think she's ending it! You're not sure if she's going to change her mind until she literally LEAPS for love.

I love a lot of Meg Ryan's movies, but I've never been particularly fond of Hugh Jackman. However, Jackman's performance in this movie quickly made me a fan! Ryan and Jackman are perfect together, creating a couple that simply lights up the screen. Though some might claim that Kate & Leopold glosses over plot to smash two characters together, I do not feel this is true at all. The relationship builds realistically, and it is clear that these are two characters who truly do love each other by the end. They're both lost, until they find each other. The movie's sets are also wonderful to watch, and the cultural differences that are presented are interesting and thought-provoking. In Leopold, Jackman creates what I and several of my friends have deemed the most romantic man alive, and in Kate, Ryan manages to craft an intriguing, intelligent woman. Kate & Leopold is a must see!

Not sure why, but this piece actually reminds me of the 1997 Val-Kilmer-version of The Saint. Leopold's directness is one of two parts (Stings music is the second part) that make this movie worth the watch.  Really, the way to tell someone you like them, is to tell them, directly, that you like them.  It is very refreshing to see what kind of man could and probably does exist...somewhere out there.In addition Leopold's rejection of the indignities that we tolerate for the sake of personal advancement is a cue to the fact that having to bend over so far is not advancement.  It is simply bending over.I think Leopold gives one of the best definitions for Brave that I have ever heard ... The brave are simply those who see clearly what is before them, danger and glory alike and not withstanding go out to meet it.  I hope that's close.  If you can get beyond the time travel and really look at how these characters change each other, this piece becomes a life lesson.

There's not much substance to it, the content doesn't bear close scrutiny, and a steady diet of the stuff would be both dull and unhealthy. But oh, it's such a delight to indulge in.I confess, I enjoyed this movie, almost in spite of myself. Even while the rational part of me was pointing out plot inconsistencies and logic errors in the whole time-travel premise, the die-hard romantic part kept telling it, Shut up, I'm watching this. It helps a lot that Hugh Jackman plays Leopold, the 19th-century aristocrat who gets dragged into our time and falls for modern gal Kate (Meg Ryan). I'm a bit biased on this score, I'll freely admit. I find Jackman very attractive--one of the sexiest actors to come down the pike in recent years.He has that mix of talent, energy, and dark good looks that I find very appealing in an actor; I imagine he could turn a phone-book reading into a watchable production. Here, he transcends the silliness of Kate & Leopold's basic concept by creating a very charming leading man. Leopold is set up as a romantic ideal, and Jackman fits that part nicely, but more importantly he brings an accessible, human element to the role. There is a moment, for example, when Kate is trying to hail a cab, and Leopold is drawn to one of the horse-drawn carriages that drive through Central Park. His attraction to this quaint sight, so comfortably familiar in a place which is so alien to him, is very touching.For her own part, Ryan just has to step into the romantic-comedy shoes she's inhabited so often before. She's an old hand at this sort of movie, and she coast through it with the easy confidence of a professional who makes their job look easy, perhaps because for them it is.The first part of the film is mostly devoted to some standard fish-out-of-water scenarios, not all of which work. Things pick up a bit when Kate's brother Charlie (Breken Meyer) arrives and strikes up a friendship with Leopold. Charlie's an actor, and he assumes that Leo is simply a particularly devout practitioner of the dramatic arts. Meyer is by far the best of the supporting cast, and the scenes where he and Leopold try to sort out each other's love lives are some of the better ones in the film.Liev Schreiber plays Stuart, Kate's ex and the scientist responsible for putting Leopold into this century, but his character is mostly sacrificed to the demands of the story.Kate & Leopold is, ultimately, a romantic fantasy. It's not about the reality of love, but the kind of dream we partake of for a short while before returning to reality. If you enjoy that sort of thing (and you know who you are), go ahead, make up a nice big bowl of popcorn, curl up in front of the DVD player, and indulge yourself. I won't tell anyone.

In fact, you likely would not have rented it in the first place.Kate & Leopold is a pleasant, predictable little movie, that gives us the exact minimum amount of science necessary to gleefully carry on with its plot - a 19th century Duke caught in present day New York. The Duke is a New Yorker, but not the kind that that we know. The movie dwells more on his adaptation to rudeness, quick pace and lack of culture than anything else. A gentleman is a gentleman, and there are things that he does and does not do - end of sentence.Intertwined is a fluffy plot about Duke Leopold and Kate (Meg Ryan) meeting, disliking, falling for, being cautious about, confiding in and having fun with eachother. Does she believe he is a Duke? Does she understand the space time continuum? The movie does not care, so neither should we.Kate & Leopold contains some wonderful scenes of discovery as the Duke finds his old home, the bridge that was being built in his day, and small remnants of refined culture (a violin player on the street). That said, I would have appreciated more attention to the details of the opera and musical quoted (La Boheme and Pirates of Penzance), both which debuted after the Duke left his time in 1876.Kate & Leopold has a very strong supporting role from Liev Schreiber (Sum of All Fears, RKO 281), showing good comic abilities as Kate's ex-boyfriend who is the only one who knows the truth about the Duke. Naturally, he is thought to be insane.To describe the plot is unnecessary, since you already know it if you have seen When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail and countless other Meg Ryan movies.

I'm not a huge fan of Meg Ryan or her unfortunate weed-whacker haircuts, but she wasn't that bad in this movie.  However, I do wish that she would try to stretch her acting muscles in other roles and leave the winsome romantic stuff to others.  She has had her time as America's sweetheart, but what went over well when she was 30 is a bit harder to take from someone hitting 40.  The ditzy charm of Innerspace and French Kiss has given way to the self-absorbed, solipsistic Kate.  I suppose she needed to be uptight and career-driven to make her transformation under Leopold's Old World charm more apparent.  (Wait, but isn't that what usually happens in her movies????)

But, what can I say about this movie, disappointing?  Dire?  Heavy handed?  Yes, it is all those and more, with one exception and I promise that I am not being biased here, Hugh Jackman, if it hadn't been for his lovely turn as Leopold then this film would have no saving graces whatsoever, this is an actor who can carry a film all by himself.  The premise of the story is very good, but, for some reason it is never fully capitalised on and by half way through it has become thoroughly boring and I only managed to stick with it to the end simply because of Jackman, who makes any movie watchable, but, in this case only just.  As for Meg Ryan, I have to agree with many others in saying she is now a bit too old for playing these kind of roles, she was very good in many earlier films, especially the 'chick flicks' of which I'm a big fan of, but, now she is unconvincing. All in all I was desperately disappointed and couldn't sit through it again not even for Hugh Jackman, who, by the way, is a major talent with incredible charisma and screen presence and should be offered better roles than this, I look forward to seeing him in X-Man 2 and in better things in the future.  3 out of 10 for the movie, 10 out of 10 for Jackman who deserves to be a huge star.

This was also not a movie that I had heard particularly a lot about, so I was curious to se what was happening. I certainly wasn't disappointed that I took the plunge.The movie has by no means a faultless script or screenplay, but the story quite frankly, works.  I liked the fact that there were genuinely funny moments, and that the story steered clear of all the melodramatic love bits that could have been incorporated in the movie. It was a love story that was kept simple and uncomplicated and was quick to get to the point.  No time was wasted on soppy, unnecessary and cliched love scenes that could have bored the audience and spoiled the films appeal.Unfortunately for me though Meg Ryan was a disappointment.  She should really try something new, like testing her acting abilities in other genres of film.  Although I liked her in this role, her acting represented nothing that I haven't seen her doing before. Her facial expressions, tone of voice, sometimes neurotic routines...its been done so many times before in her other movies.  In her previous movies however it was sweet, this time I found it to be mildly annoying.  Not that she doesn't still look the part, after all these years she is still able to carry off the sweetheart image to perfection.  I just think that its time that she experimented with other more diverse acting roles, instead of trying to do the same thing all the time.  To be fair to her though, I was pleasantly surprised at the chemistry between her and Hugh Jackman.  I really wasn't expecting that.  Nice one!Hugh Jackman is however worth the cinema ticket alone!  He is fantastic in this film.  I love the way he brings this character to life, the manner in which he chose to portray it, and sincerity with which he brings Leopold to life.  The dashing, debonair and gentlemanly manner of his character is something he manages to bring across so well. This is definitely something I would like to see him do again.  It just proves that he is an actor that gets better with every role. It's easy to see why he's currently hot property in Hollywood.Also just a quick word about Breckin Meyer who played the role of Charlie, Meg Ryans brother, this is another young actor that's carving a name for himself in good movies. He really holds a major source of the films appeal and humour, a good actor that will soon have script writers banging on his door.This is a harmless funny and romantic movie. It makes you wonder what ever happened to chivalry! ) So if you're looking for a nice night out, this movie gets my vote. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Quite a disappointment","Date":"17 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  Possible spoilers, I suppose.My husband and I are fans of Meg Ryan, and so we had meant to watch this movie for quite some time.  We rented it tonight and we were quite disappointed for several reasons.First and foremost was Meg Ryan's character.  I don't know if it was the way she played Kate, or the way the scriptwriters wrote Kate, or the way the directors directed Meg, or a combination of the above, but I could not stand this woman!  And that goes beyond the dislike for her twitty, totally dense nature. I don't know if we were meant to like her, but I certainly didn't. By the end of the movie, I didn't want her to go back in time simply because I didn't want anything nice to happen to her.  I thought it would serve her right to spend the rest of her life sucking up to her philandering fake of a boss. If it wasn't enough that she was clueless about people and had totally backward priorities, her mannerisms and her appearance were completely irritating.  And what on earth happened to her hair??  Is this even the same person who was in Sleepless in Seattle?  I know it's not trendy to be pretty these days, but has it gone so far that an actress making millions of dollars for a film has hair (and at times clothes) that a scarecrow wouldn't be caught *dead* with??  In short, I never thought I would see a mediocre movie where Meg Ryan was the weakest spot, but now I have.Hugh Jackman was OK, and he acted his part well.  However, the writers had him adapt a bit too easily to life in the 21st century, even for an inventor who would take things in stride a bit better than most.  He adopted modern mannerisms too naturally, in my opinion.Among the few bright points in the movie were Kate's administrative assistant, Darcy and her brother Charley, with Jackman's gallantry having a minor role in pulling the movie out of the worst I've ever seen category.  Maybe the producers would like to hire these three to star in a movie that would actually be romantic and funny.  It would have to be better than Kate and Leopold, anyway.

Upon going into my home theater I expected yet another boring chick flick romance film but what I got was a delightful surprise. Upon the start of the film the viewer in transported into 1876 New York and into the life of an English Duke Leopold, played by the wonderful Australian import Hugh Jackman.  Leopold laments at the emptiness of his life and his desire to make something of himself.  Leopold then meets a strange man Stuart, played by Liev Schreiber, and follows him into a time portal and straight into 2001 New York.  Here he meets Kate (Meg Ryan) who plays a tough corporate woman in an advertising agency.  Basically then it's a predictable romance between the naïve Jackman and the savvy yet romance starved Ryan.  The movie has some really funny moments relating to the anachronistic Jackman.  The comedic performance by Jackman is light and whimsical and has the audience with grins on their faces throughout the picture.  The movie also has tender moments which although adding to the general effect of the picture tend to slow it down almost to the point of boredom.  Perhaps female viewers will not find this fault but in this reviewers opinion the last half hour of the movie kept on begging me to fast forward to the end.  The ending is bright and feel-good which redeems the boringness of the last portion of the movie.  Finally, what truly made this film were all the extra features that were on the DVD.  The disc contains two great featurettes on the making of the film and the costume design of the film.  Also on the disc are about 5 or 6 deleted scenes which when viewed with the director's commentary provide great insight into the mind and intentions of the director.  Bottom line Great rental for a date or with your family. "}{"Title":"Charming, delightful, and funny","Date":"22 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":"  A romantic comedy between two characters from different times is an idea rich in potential.  Writer/director James Mangold takes full advantage of the possibilities in this enchanting film that juxtaposes the cultures and values of the late 19th and early 21st centuries New York City.Mangold shows his versatility here by venturing into the light and breezy zone after strong directorial showings in the more heavy handed `Girl Interrupted' and `Cop Land'.  Despite the clear departure from his previous melodramatic films, Mangold again proves is that he is an excellent actors' director, inducing terrific performances from the entire cast.The story is full of heartrending moments and hilarious culture shock gags as Leopold (Hugh Jackman) attempts to adapt to the technology and attitudes of modern society.  Mangold is successful at making the point that though much has changed around us, we as people are still very much the same.  Unfortunately, in his zeal to tell a great tale, Mangold plays fast and loose with historical details.  If one is going to make a time travel film, one should research the respective eras and represent history accurately.  The film is rife with anachronisms, especially regarding theater and opera.  Leopold is from 1876, but makes reference to `La Boheme' (1896), `Pirates of Penzance' (1879), and `Tosca' (1898), none of which had yet been performed by the time he left the past.  Also, Brooklyn Bridge architect John Augustus Roebling is seen giving a speech seven years after he died, and Leopold mentions Jack the Ripper, who didn't commit his first murder until the late 1880's.  Still, much can be forgiven for a tale so touchingly and amusingly told.The acting is excellent by the entire cast.  Hugh Jackman's career grows exponentially with each new role.  A veritable unknown when he took the part of Wolverine in `X-Men', he blew the doors off that part and never looked back.  Since then he has delivered three outstanding performances (`Someone Like You', `Swordfish', `Kate and Leopold'), in all cases rising above the vehicle in which he appeared and eclipsing numerous fine actors.  Jackman has the potential to become this generation's Cary Grant, having dapper good looks and an amiable personality with the versatility to glide effortlessly from serious drama to charming comedies.  In this part he is absolutely magnetic, giving a performance that is as powerful as it is captivating.Meg Ryan returns to her best genre and gives another terrific performance.  Ryan has enjoyed thirteen fabulous years since she broke through with `When Harry Met Sally' in 1989, but is in the twilight of her romantic comedy years.  If she hopes to continue as an actor, she will need to move to different roles that don't require the freshness and adorability that fade with age.  This role is a good hybrid, having her deal with the serious issues of a career woman, while also allowing her to slip on the romantic glove that fits her so well.Liev Schreiber, Breckin Meyer, Natasha Lyonne, and Bradley Whitford all give strong supporting performances, stealing scenes left and right from the two leads.This film is a marvelous date flick that is easy to enjoy by men and women alike.  The humor is truly funny, the romance engaging and the acting superb.  I rated it an 8/10, penalizing it a bit for the historical cheating, but if you like romantic comedy this film will deliver a wonderful evening of delightful entertainment.

There is nothing I like more than a good romantic comedy, and if you throw a little historical stuff in as well, even better.That said, this movie really left me disappointed.  In the first place, it seemed like the dialogue was written by two different people. All of the men have great lines, while Kate's dialogue is extremely bad.  I normally love Meg Ryan, but in this film, she is not enjoying herself and it shows.  The chemistry between her and Jackman was nonexistent, which I think was mainly due to her aforementioned lack of enthusiasm.  I absolutely hated her character as well, who displayed quite the split personality by switching from bitter, jaded career woman to hopeless (literally without hope in this case) romantic without any rhyme or reason.  I have never wanted to slap someone so badly as I did when she made Leopold leave her apartment during the dinner scene. Drunk or not, what a horrible woman!Jackman gave a stellar performance in this movie and basically carried the entire thing with admirable help from the other supporting characters (particularly Schreiber). I look forward to seeing more of him at the box office, but I really think this movie could have been much better if they had cast someone else for Kate (Jennifer Aniston, who has performed very well in the films she has done and can play a similar type, came to mind). I really just wanted Ryan to go away.  I don't know what her problem was (perhaps this was filmed during that mess with Russell Crowe?), but she pretty much ruined this movie for me.In short, it's well worth seeing for Jackman's performance, but Meg Ryan was abysmal.

You know the drill before you even press the Play button on the VCR. Meg Ryan is gonna fall in love with Hugh Jackman. Duh. So predictability aside, the movie isn't bad. It's just what the genre is all about. Leopold is a Duke from the 19th century who accidentally follows Stuart (Liev Schreiber) through a time portal, in which Stuart has just discovered. But the time portal is the last thing this movie is about. In fact, little time is spent on it at all, which is strange because such a discovery deserves a little more marvel than these characters give it. But anyways, back to the love story. Once through the portal, Leopold falls into place in modern day New York a tad too fast. A few gawks at buildings and stares at appliances and he's already over the fact that he just traveled through time. Talk about adjustment. But character logic aside, Jackman is ultimately charming as a 19th century gentlemen, sent to the 21st century to sweep women off their feet and spout dating (ahm...courting) advice to Kate's lost brother. Kate and Leopold don't grow close until about an hour into the movie, which is a shame because a lot of wasted scenes could have been cut to make this movie the proper length (it's a tad long). The romance works okay, mainly because Jackman is such fun to watch with his accent and snobbish remarks on society. Surprisingly, Meg Ryan's Kate isn't a very adorable character. I know this is her turf, God knows she's had enough practice playing the romantic lead in a picture, but Kate isn't a very likeable person. She yells a lot at Leopold, is career-driven, and quite dull. What Leopold sees in her is beyond me. In fact, many of the characters here aren't very useful. Liev Schreiber spends the majority of the movie in a hospital while Kate bonds with Leo. And Kate's brother is rather annoying. As a love story, this one is really jumbled. No real complications besides Kate's stubbornness exist to stop the relationship. The story is almost as flat as the characters. A romantic movie this is, and a romantic movie you'll see. But don't expect another Pretty Woman. In the end, Jackman is the reason the movie can carry on as long as it does. I give it **1/2 stars out of *****. Perhaps the Director's Cut is better. But if it's any longer than the Theatrical Version, count me out. This movie has run its course.

She still has what it takes to keep everyone's attention and this new kid on the block, Jackman, is well on his way to superstardom.I wont get into all the technical aspects of filmmaking because so many others do here, but have to say this for me, was fresh, lively and thoroughly enjoyable and though it might fall into the genre of chick flick, was cool from this guy's point of view also.With an assortment of failures lately in this area (Angel Eyes for one profound example) it's nice to see somebody put out a work that shows that someone in Hollywood still has the chops to earn their keep at the box office.  Some of the more recent tripe really must make some people angry for money not well spent.  This flick, I hope and  believe will be a bit more redeeming in its great cast, super, unseen special effects (see 'em on the dvd) and heartfelt idealism in story.  It did for me...and is worthy of all the praise I might give it...

Why do they watch movies anyway?? If we start out with the premise that this, and any other, movie has flaws, then we can begin to enjoy it. Kate and Leopold is not to be taken seriously. It is a fantasy romp where Kate's boyfriend, destined to be her own great, great grandson (is that future past incest??), discovers a crack in the time continuum that allows one to travel by jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge. Imagine that!! So, don't try to make too much sense of it. Hugh Jackman is so good as the reluctant Duke who is being pressured, in 1876, to marry a rich woman. So Leopold ends up in modern NYC, meets Kate, she finds out what a true gentleman is, and how she really despises her job fooling people into thinking they like something. But when she is ready to commit, Leopold has traveled back, otherwise how would elevators work? And what else in history would change if he never married? Perplexed, Kate sees a photo of herself, obviously in the crowd back in 1876, and has to jump off the bridge to join Leopold. Lots of funny scenes, and funny dialog. No foul language, no overt sex, no one gets killed, basically a wholesome movie with a cute story very well done. And, Bravo! to the marketers of the DVD. They included both the theatrical release and the almost 5 minutes longer director's cut, which is the one we watched. It's about time we get choices like that on the DVD. Plus there is a fairly interesting making of featurette.Overall good entertainment and viewing time well spent.Update April 2011, we watched it again. Still good entertainment.

Stuart has found a time portal below the Brooklyn Bridge, and takes a sleek little camera into 1876, where a duke named Leopold prepares to pick a wife. Intrigued, Leopold follows Stuart all the way to the bridge and accidentally lands in 2001 with him. And soon, he meets Kate. Kate is used to a very fast-paced life, while Leopold takes things slower--which is the beginning of a very long list of their differences. And at the beginning, their relationship--if they even have one--is rocky. But Leopold remains interested in getting to know Kate, and eventually, Kate realizes Leopold is the man she's been looking for. Me, I'm a sucker for really romantic flicks, but before I saw this, I don't remember anything that I liked this much. For people who don't like romantic comedies, it would probably seem sappy, but to me, it was excellent. This was the first movie that made my eyes water that wasn't sad. The chemistry between Ryan and Jackman is unbelievable. Leopold is so sweet to Kate that all the single women out there will probably wish a smart, poetic gentleman will come out of the past for them. I saw the director's cut, which adds all the footage you see if you click alternate versions, and I thought it was fine. I won't spoil anything, though. If Kate and Leopold had any flaws, it would probably be that there isn't enough screen time of the two title characters together. There's too much of everything else around them. But in the short time it shows, it's VERY romantic. And some of the time-traveling stuff isn't very believable, but hey, it's a fantasy.Meg Ryan's character, Kate McKay, is pretty likable. . She is a little outspoken, but I think that's what Leopold liked in her--she wasn't afraid to speak her mind. Also, he says her beauty is like moonlight shining on her face, or something similar. Hugh Jackman is just about perfect as Leopold. I read that he had training, and you totally believe that he's a duke from 1876. I just love the scene where he gets Kate's purse back for her. And another great thing is the end credits...or the song played during them. Until by Sting is a keeper, and ranks up on my list, just like Kate and Leopold with movies.

It has been some time since I've seen Lohengrin, but I think it goes something like this A mysterious knight appears from nowhere, and saves the heroine from ruin. He marries her on the promise that she never ask him where he came from. She ultimately breaks the promise, and he goes back to where he came from. I think Wagner kills her off for good measure.In Kate and Leopold, Leopold is a cultured nobleman from 1876. He rescues her from a purse snatcher, a boss set on sexual conquest, and professional problems (he gives her a major career boost by appearing in a commercial). Kate in turn is a neurotic and slovenly bore who betrays him by causing him to unknowingly endorse a worthless product, something entirely contrary to his code of honor.The climax to the movie has Leopold going back to 1876. This might work; the people he meets in the 21st century learn from their acquaintance with him, and perhaps he has learned something from his adventures in the 21st century that will cause him to make appropriate moral choices when he gets back.But then we have the inexplicable anti-climax. Kate is somehow persuaded to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, and goes back to 1876, where Leopold happily announces their engagement. Believe me, there is nothing whatsoever in this movie that makes it credible that the shallow and dishonorable Kate would jump off a bridge for love, or that Leopold would be happy to see her if she did. She should have been left behind like the heroine in Lohengrin (although perhaps not to die; Wagner's antipathy to women was played out a bit far, there).Oh yes, and at least one colossal anachronism. Leopold at a dinner berates Kate's boss about his ignorance of La Boheme. A neat trick considering that the opera did not come out until 1896.

Jackman,who in the film is supposed to come from 1876, gives a detailed correction of the details of the opera to Ms Ryan's boss, unfortunately, La Boheme was first produced in 1896, so Jackman's character could never have seen it unless he'd time travelled before!

'Kate and Leopold' is a good movie; definitely not 'Sleepless in Seattle' (her best, in my view) but it's a big improvement on stuff like 'Serendipity', which was very Meg-like stuff. The reason I think it will be her last romantic hit is that she is probably getting fed up of people noting that she's now 40, and will move on to do other stuff, and probably mainly produce in the not too distant future. That said, I enjoyed 'Kate and Leopold', but the writing must be on the wall, because the mainstay of this clever candyfloss is Hugh (Wolverine) Jackman, proving that he's not just an X-Man at all. Performing with all the charm of some of Hollywood's Great leading men, he holds this picture together, so Meg doesn't really have to try. After all, she can do this stuff on auto pilot anyway. Not a great movie, but one which is definitely watchable, with some capable supporting actors as well. "}{"Title":"Meg Ryan's hair is AGONY!

It is a true product of the rom com formula of boy meets girl, girl meets boy, everything is peachy for a while before boy loses girl due to some sort of misunderstanding, friends and/or family intervene, boy and girl discover error of their ways and get back together again, the end. This movie is no exception, so do not expect anything original in spite of a little time travelling, because the &#145;fish out of water' concept takes a backseat to the budding romance between Kate and Leopold. Now that's established, sit back and enjoy a non-demanding, nonsensical piece of feel-good fun.Meg Ryan may receive top billing, but believe me it is Hugh Jackman who carries this film. Clearly an intelligent actor, Jackman is perfect as Leopold. Sexy, masculine, charismatic, charming, clever and articulate, with shades of Mr Darcy. In short, he is every girl's dream! How depressing that he should end up with someone as two-dimensional as Kate. Her character appeared under-developed next to Leopold, she was never really given a chance to shine and she spent most of the movie being annoyed with somebody or something, and seemed to be immune to Leopold's charm most of the time &#150; I'm not sure how! Their scenes together were sweet overall, but I thought the chemistry could have been stronger between them.All credit to Jackman's skill in managing to play the charismatic, and chivalrous Leopold without making him appear effeminate or convoluted which could so easily have happened. He is convincing, but most importantly, still masculine. And he does a fine job! One objection I might make is that for someone who has found themselves 125 years into the future, Leopold gets used to his new surroundings very quickly considering the short time he is there! He is seemingly unfazed by the concept of T.V., phones, cars and modern day music. And the movie neatly avoids any reaction Leopold might have to sticky subjects like premarital sex, illegitimacy, secularisation, not to mention 21st century colloquialism. He has no difficulty understanding the slangage of Kate and the other characters, and all of this is attributed to Leopold's intelligence, his forward-thinking attitudes and his knowledge of scientific advancement. Yet, is this really enough? Ok, so this movie is obviously not supposed to be taken too seriously but at one point, Leopold prepares a sumptuous meal for Kate. Would a 19th century aristocrat really know how to cook? Hmm... This movie is ultimately about questioning what is important in life and prioritising accordingly. Effectively, Kate has it all. She's just got her long-awaited promotion, and now she's found Leopold. If she could have them both she would. But this just isn't possible. Forced to choose, she follows her heart. Yet despite the happy ending, this movie left me feeling rather unfulfilled, particularly in the last scene. I also wish Kate's 'acceptance' speech could have been better written and more poignant, rather than being along the flimsy lines of 'It's nice to get what you want, unless you find that the thing you thought you wanted, isn't what you wanted at all', which looks doubly clumsy alongside Stuart's touching 'dog and rainbow' monologue and the majority of Leopold's dialogue. It would be nice to see a sequel to this movie, perhaps entitled &#145;Leopold and Kate' that deals with Kate's integration into the nineteenth century under Leopold's tutelage, and perhaps a flying visit to 21st century New York through the newly-opened timehole, to clear up the loose ends! I'll keep hoping!

His part in this film is fairly good, however the film as a whole doesn't even measure up to his previous effort (which wasn't particularly memorable itself).The concept of the film is unashamedly unoriginal - a blatant combination of the fish out of water comedy, with the typical boy meets girl, they fall in love romance which has been done so many times before. The first half of this combo succeeds; the second does not.The best thing about this film is the dialogue. Hugh Jackman's character has travelled through time from 18th century England, and some of the things he has to say about modern day New York are very colourful, very funny and rather well delivered. However, only Jackman's dialogue is any good - most of Meg Ryan's lines are utterly vapid (You need help, Stuart. You need help.) and her character seems generally unmotivated. It's almost as if the two parts were written by different people, one of whom had an iota of creative talent.To add to this problem, there is not much chemistry between Ryan and Jackman. At least, if there is, James Mangold does a pretty poor job of showing it - switching between shots of the two leads with various random expressions on their faces. The relationship should be based on the actions, and dialogue, of the two characters; here, there is little or no interaction taking place, and we can only assume that the bond developing between them is 100% physical attraction. This is quite a serious problem - it seems as if the film-makers think you can just stick two attractive people on screen together, and that having them fall in love is the logical result. It's not. It's unrealistic. Especially since Ryan's character seems for the most part to be a depressed, career-driven woman who wants nothing to do with the male contingent of the population.All that aside, there is still something for me to criticise; the basic premise, for starters, is obviously rather silly, but I'll forgive that; the intricacies of the plot which make up the story are very contrived - something needs smoothing out at the script stage; the main subplot seems irrelevant and unnecessary; the Moon River bit was a very unimaginative way to insert some romantic New-Yorkicism; the list goes on, leading to a film which in most places just doesn't feel right.Thumbs up for Jackman's dialogue (and his performance in general - he comes off as a likeable fellow and good romantic lead) and a couple of other comedic moments (thanks to Breckin Meyer)... Thumbs down to pretty much the whole rest of it. It may seem a bit harsh, but it didn't do much for me. And I know Meg Ryan can do better than this.Oh, and for all the goof-spotters out there Puccini's La Boheme premiered in 1898... 100 years after Leopold's time. Oops.

Once Leopold realizes how blithely some men treat women, he is stunned. He always stands when a woman answers the phone, opens doors, and even rescues Kate's snatched purse. Leopold is a true gentleman whose love and chivalry would make the world a better place if more men followed his example. The costumes, props and lighting in Leopold's 1876 home are breathtaking.

It impressed me when Kate eating the breakfast which was cooked by Leopold with eyes brimming with tears. It's a very complicated feeling and Meg expressed it well. I also appreciated Hugh Jackman. As a soul role, he has done his best. Besides his gorgeous looks, he possesses every gentleman qualities. It's such a big difference with the Wolverine. He is definitely one of my favorite actors.

The actors are lovely, and so is the easy flowing dialog. The basic plot is modern girl falls for guy out of the past, and all through, the film even manages to avoid all of the `I'm out of this world' cliches. The modern fisty girl is Meg Ryan is doing her non-harmful comeback to the trademark blonde sweetie role (always named Kate or Catherine for some reason), and is mostly not annoying at all. The male Lead by the non-Hollywood-wimp-(finally...), Hugh Jackman is probably the best part of the movie, since apparently the guy can act rather well and is very much at ease with celluloid and himself. I believe the film has three basic points a - you don't really have to think during the viewing or after it. b - CGI can be nasty when used in a romantic comedy. c-  And now for us girls It turns out that even if you are Meg Ryan, with your own personal stylist team  24/7, it is impossible to find a good man today, and your only option is to make your friends at Miramax get you one that does not really exist(please Make a cool Aussie dude talk with a British accent, ride a horse, and have the staff write in some manners too).

The actors were charming to watch, the dialogue was quick and funny, and the plot had just the right amounts of comedy and romance (not to mention a clever way of including time travel without making the movie too cheesy).  Luckily for me, I was able to see a sneak preview before it opened in theaters.  This is lucky because some people got upset with a certain aspect of the movie that implied incest (I think people are waaaaay too touchy especially since I didn't even think of that implication until a few hours after watching the movie), and the makers reacted to the complaints by cutting out the parts that included this aspect.  Unfortunately, taking out all parts pertaining to that aspect REALLY affects the movie.  The plot makes a little less sense now, and without these scenes, the movie seems more unrealistic and cheesy than in the earlier version.  For those of you who have seen it (i.e. for those of you who don't want any parts ruined for you, don't read the rest of this), the aspect they took out was the fact that Leopold is Stuart's relative (if I recall correctly, his Great Grandfather), thus making Kate also his relative (again, if I recall correctly, his Great Grandmother). Personally, I don't see the big deal (I would bring up the many reasons why, but this review is already somewhat long).  Anyway, the problems with taking this out are this explains why Stuart went back in time to see Leopold in particular; this emphasizes the importance of getting Leopold back in time (so he CAN'T stay in the future with Kate) since if he doesn't, Stuart won't be born; this also explains the importance of getting Kate to go back in time; finally, there are multiple references to this piece of information that add humor and continuity to the film.  So, in other words, I may have a skewed view of the movie since I saw a different version, but I still think it's great.

Liev Schreiber is thouroughly believable as Stuart Besser, Meg's ex-boyfriend who's found the portal in time that we all know exists somewhere, who'd of thought it was just off the Brooklyn Bridge. Anyway Liev has a touchingly well written scene about colorblind dogs.

Visually, the fellow in the lead was a hottie, which definitely helped, and not to sound shallow, but Meg Ryan's hair and lipliner was distractingly badly done!

On the plus side, I loved Leopold's big old house and the period ball costumes. Meg's actor brother taking advice from Leopold in how to attract women the old fashioned way was definitely the strength in the movie.  Also, this movie includes an excellent line about sundays that rings true for working folks.  Not a good movie to see if you are going through a breakup as it may hit too close to home about what women hope for in a guy.

(Dir James Mangold)I love Meg Ryan.  Have since Top Gun and Innerspace  when her beguilingly cute kewpie doll kisser popped onscreen with her plucky and feisty sexiness on full display that has since parlayed into a cottage industry as The Single Girl Alone on Saturday Night (her trifecta of romantic screwball comedies with Tom Hanks - Joe Vs. The Volcano, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail ) which have solidified her as one of the few actresses working today in Hollywood as 'bankable' (Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Michelle Pfeiffer are the others that come immediately to mind with Gwyneth Paltrow in the wings).  And When Harry Met Sally. confirmed her mettle as a comedienne mixing it up with surly Billy Crystal into an unlikely coupling that has only endeared her to me even despite her recent gossip rags off-screen romantic life (you know who and with who so I won't sully her already troubled persona).I just wish Meg would realize she is a genuine hottie and perhaps 'stretch' a little as an actress by avoiding the typecasting as an old-maid for the new millennium.  In her latest she treads familiar territory but with a unique - although not highly original - slant time-travelling romance a la Back to The Future with current hot-throb, Jackman. The fun begins in 2001 New York City when intrepid scientific researcher Stuart Besser (Schreiber excelling in the Ralph Bellamy role with some welcome slapstick buffoonery) who has discovered a portal in a rip in the fabric of time (yes that old chestnut in sci-fi) in hurtling himself in the time-space continuum by visiting Old New York circa 1876 where he follows the fascinating Leopold Alexis Elijah Walker Garteh Thomas Mountbatten (Jackman) who is a sullen duke of  a well-to-do snobbish family that is insisting he marry a socialite to save the family name.  Upon discovering Stuart snooping around his manor Leopold gives chase up The Brooklyn Bridge whereupon both pursuer and persuee wind up hurtling back to 2001 and the out-of-sorts gentleman crashes at the erstwhile time traveler's Manhattan pad. Enter Kate McKay (Ryan), Stu's neighbor and current ex-girlfriend, who comes across Leopold and figuring he's a flaky expat pal of Stu's paying him no mind as to who he really is and treating him like everyone in her life on the superfluous superficial edge of her contempt.  Kate is a go-go getter junior ad exec jockeying to join the creative team of her superior JJ (Whitford in another of his patented a**hole types) who just wants to jump Kate's bones in the long run. When Stu gets into a nasty accident - taking a header down an empty elevator shaft - and finding himself declared mentally unstable (thanks to his rapid-fire demeanor and explanation of his discovery, natch) - Leopold makes himself at home as best he can with Stu's apartment and traveling thru New York with the aid of Kate's younger brother Charlie (Meyer, late of the ill-fated sitcom Inside Schwartz) a struggling actor who (at first) believes Leo to be a true Method thespian working his craft.Leopold eventually develops some unknown feelings (i.e. love) for the brassy Kate and she melts for him after some feats of gallantry and gentlemanly manners never before witnessed by her in her attempts at relationships with men.  The two are naturally perfect for each other but time is ticking for Leo to return by the end of the week to 1876 or else his invention of the elevator will never occur (among other things). The film is a bit too cutesy yet it is appealing in the long run thanks to the pleasantries of Jackman combining his good looks with comic aplomb and his pairing with Ryan proves chemistry is indeed an exact science.  The screenplay is an odd choice for indie filmmaker Mangold (who co-wrote with Steven Rogers) yet is not a complete loss thanks to the ideal ensemble especially the always welcome Lyonne as Kate's Girl Friday and the aforementioned Meyer who nearly steals the film particularly his wooing of the fair and unobtainable Patrice (Ayanna). A likable 'date' flick of the high order by all means but I hope our fair Ms. Ryan avoids going to the well on her next gig.

I was content with every part of it, and that makes for an excellent movie.

Even though we have all adored her in her forte as a romantic-comedienne, where she absolutely blossoms, and she still does in this You've-Got-Mail-Meets-Back-To-The-Future flick. (That may be a lame comparison, but who *doesn't* think of the 1985 classic when someone mentions the space-time continuum?) But Hugh Jackman breaks out of his normal action-figure role into something completely refined and cordial. I adored him in X-Men, and seeing him play Leopold (and garner a worthy nomination) makes me realize he was more than just hunky and cool to watch as Wolverine. I've heard he played his character well in Password Swordfish. It proves this man is an actor, and I dare say, soon-to-be an actor's actor, like we see in Meg Ryan's sleepless romantic counterpart.

It marks the return of Meg Ryan to movies that she does best, and another impressive star turn from Hugh Jackman. Director Mangold, who also wrote the screenplay with Steven Rogers, constructs a charming time travel romance which asks the audience not to concern themselves with the technical details, and care for the characters as they do. This is what works best. Stuart (well played by Liev Schrieber) is a preoccupied inventor, who discovers a time portal to the 1870's near the Brooklyn Bridge. On one of his trips back to present day New York, Stuart is unexpectedly accompanied by Duke Leopold (Hugh Jackman). Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who lives in a downstairs apartment, meets Leopold and initially is not too impressed-- noting that Leo is dressed like Sgt. Pepper. High powered ad executive, Ms. McKay, soon finds herself drawn to the 19th century Duke. Chivalry lives in K&L.Mangold and Rogers avoid the very trite fish out of water comedy by the use of it's characters. Leopold is an inventor-- he would invent the elevator. So Leopold is fascinated by technology, and is perplexed by modern society-- or lack there of. Leopold is a gentlemen among the clueless masses including Kate's boss, JJ (a slick Bradley Whitford), who is hitting on Kate. Leopold also befriends and coaches Kate's brother Charlie (a very funny Breckin Meyer), a wanna be actor. The strength of the movie comes from the integrity of it's main characters played by Ryan and Jackman. Meg Ryan's Kate is the successful modern woman, who sold out on a lot of things in her life including love. Ryan plays Kate with the right tough covering for the girl, who knows that her life is incomplete. Hugh Jackman is the classic romantic leading man. He is handsome, charming, and a natural gentleman. Jackman as Leo is a gentleman. This authenticity and integrity of character breathes life into the story. Leopold loves Kate. He would do anything for her. In a great scene Charlie asks Leo who he really is. Leopold says I am the man who is in love with your sister. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman are wonderful together and under the direction and care of James Mangold, Kate & Leopold is something quite special.

So far, so good, but Leopold also seems to know quite a bit about the years in between1. He refers to Thomas Edison's incandescent lamp, which was not invented until 1879.2. He teaches a child to sing I am the very model of a modern Major General from THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE, which was also not composed until 1879.3. In a key scene, Kate's boss has pretentiously declared his love of opera, claiming that he learned French from watching LA BOHEME.  Leopold correctly berates him because the opera was written and is usually performed in Italian--but it was not composed until 1896!

For the scifi fans, the whole time travel thing is messed up and inconsistent (someone shows up in a photo during a time they weren't even there).  Despite what some critics say, the dog was fine.  He moved the plot, provided (sometimes weak) comic interlude, and gave the leading man an opportunity to impress us with his winning ways with animals.  We were beautifully set up for him to then apply those winning ways to a horse and the leading lady, respectively.Meg Ryan has lost about three points on the perkymeter, but she is still more adorable than anyone except Sandra Bullock.  She breaks no new ground in this little film, but neither does she disappoint.  If you liked her in the past (Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle), you'll like her here. If not - check out Vanilla Sky for the antiperky Penelope Cruz!The real (no big) surprise is that Hugh Jackman continues in his conquest of the American filmgoing public.  He is intelligent, charming, handsome, sincere - a Mel Gibson for the new generation.  He reminded me of a real man's version of Rupert Everett.  This guy should be around for a long, long time.I caught Breckin Meyer on his short-lived sitcom, Inside Schwartz.  He continues to delight with his open, accessible wit and vulnerability.  I don't know what kind of career this fellow has ahead of him, but, if any casting directors are reading this, I like him.  He has that innate ability to play the best buddy ala Bruno Kirby or Jim Belushi.  Breckin may not be leading man material, but he will make your leading man more effective every time out.In conclusion, while this movie is not a waste of money, you'll probably enjoy it more if you watch it while curled up on the sofa with your main squeeze.

It was sweet. Almost too sweet. But, that's alright. Above all, I came to see a movie. To see a love story unfold. I didn't come to study camera angles, and direction. It really wasn't that bad. Hugh Jackman, as Leopold, can literally charm the pants off of almost any woman he pleases. No offense meant in that last statement. He portrays a character who has never felt love, until he happens to come to the 21st Century and fall in love with Kate. You have to really sympathize with both characters, who were indeed meant to be together. It leaves the viewer wondering if something as magical as that could really happen...It left me floating on a dream for hours.

They are usually very formulaic Put someone in the past/future and then weave 2 hours of slapstick around not knowing how to drive a car or ballroom dance. If Meg Ryan wasn't starring in this I might not have bothered to see it.However, I was pleasantly surprised because this movie is more about romance than time-travel. Hugh Jackman plays the Duke of Albany Leopold, who inadvertently follows Stuart (Liev Schrieber) through a time-travel portal into the future. Here he meets Stuart's ex-girfriend Kate (Meg Ryan) and falls in love. Rather than resorting to watching Leopold bumble around the 21st century, the movie centers on Kate's distrust of men and Leopold's capabilities with them. Breckin Meyer plays Kate's brother Charlie and adds the humorous elements to the film. As we watch Kate and Leopold fall in love, the story does take a few twists and turns that kept me grinning. Hugh Jackman is just charming in this role and you can't help but fall in love with him as well (what's a few centuries difference, anyway?)Not much is spent on the technical aspects of time travel, and the few instances of learning to make a toilet flush or marveling over a toaster you see in the trailers is all you see. Leopold embraces the future with the same suave he does socially; so in that respect you canbelieve it when he runs the dishwasher with no difficulty. Like most Meg Ryan films, the ending is fairy tale enough to justify the silly plot. I enjoyed it very much.My biggest beef with this film was the blantant product placement! It was so bad I started counting and made it up to 10 major placements in the first 40 minutes. Note to Ms. Ryan Take a stand on this. Having your character dump a latte all over her white shirt only to have her coleague call up Barneys and order a Donna Karan shirt is beneath you now. I don't think Starbucks needs to pander to such antics.

That is plain cheating!Nora Ephron did the same thing in You've Got Mail by ending the film with Somewhere over the Rainbow.2) Couldn't somebody have checked that La Boheme premiered in 1896? This means Leopold couldn't have known about the opera in 1876!3) I think Kate's brother makes a comment to the effect that women probably think Leopold is gay because he's so gallant and good-looking. I don't quite remember exactly. But it seems Leopold should have reacted to the use of the word gay.

Sometimes, a movie is just a movie, with no particular message, no social commentary, no controversies.  It just aims to provide a pleasant couple of hours.  Kate and Leopard aims squarely for this category, and pretty much hits the mark.Meg Ryan is getting on a bit to be playing roles better suited for ingenues.  She would be well served by telling her directors in no uncertain terms NOT to put her in extreme close-ups.  I cringed a few times when the camera zoomed in or found a particularly unflattering angle.  Since the plot revolves around a handsome fellow quickly falling in love with her, this is not a minor point.  A nice actress for light romantic comedies, Ryan could be termed the Doris Day of her day, and leaves a number of fine performances.  It's just that her day appears to be passing.  She should consider choosing different sorts of roles, with more mature male leads.This is Hugh Jackman's movie.  He dominates every scene in which he appears.  One can easily imagine him being picked for the ad spot that figures prominently in the plot.  Very suave characterization.  I expect great things from him.Breckin Meyer, as Ryan's wacky brother, steals several scenes.  He adds an entire dimension to the film, as an example of how the extreme casualness and narcissism of modern life has in some respects gone too far for everybody's liking.  He learns his lesson in an engaging sort of way.The plot shamelessly borrows elements of Being John Malkovitch and dozens of time travel films (and tv shows) without adding anything particularly original.  There are some historical inaccuracies (Roebling's bizarre speech about time as the fourth dimension toward the beginning of the film is particularly anachronistic), but those are fine points.  We are meant to be entertained by the fish out of water scenario, and the likable actors certainly help that process along.The first half is far better than the rest.  Jackman as gallant hero who struggles to win over Ryan's affections is amusing.  Once the plot descends into murky questions of artistic integrity and it becomes fairly obvious what Ryan must do, the film loses focus and becomes fairly tedious.  Sleepless in Seattle this film is not.  It is far lighter, less engaging and lacking in emotional punch.  But, again, it may divert you from your cares for a couple of hours, as intended.Nice date movie, also know as a chick flick.

Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan have a good chemistry, so it works as a romance movie and has a good bit of humor.Jackman plays a man from 1876 named Leopold. He is transported into the future through a time portal located at the Brooklyn Bridge. The fault lays with Stuart (Liev Schreiber), he was the one who discovered this portal and Leopold follows him and falls into the water, they both go to New York in 2001. Leopold meets Kate McKay (Ryan), Stuart's old boyfriend. At first, she's a bit uneasy about this guy, but they slowly develop a friendship and inevitably falls for him. The problem is, Leopold needs to go back to 1876, or the elevator wouldn't have been invented and Stuart wouldn't exist.Leopold is the perfect gentleman, he's polite, handsome, caring, kind, and sensitive. He is full of compasion and chivalry. Leopold is scared of things like the television, rock music, and the telephone. He is overwhelmed by New York as it is today. He can't believe that the bridge still stands. Leopold meets Kate's actor brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer) and finds him quite interesting. Charlie thinks that Leopold is an actor, a damn good one at that. The romance between Kate and Leopold grows, but Kate isn't a 100% sure she believes him about being a Duke or coming from 1876.KATE & LEOPOLD's story is implausable and it doesn't really make complete sense. It works for what the movie is really about, but the screenwriters could have made the time-travel subplot make more sense. The screenplay by James Mangold and Steven Rogers has moments of cleverness and humor, but lacks a certain charm that SERENDIPITY was so full of. But thank God it wasn't as bad some earlier attempts like SOMEONE LIKE YOU. The movie has some great moments, but seems like it wants to get past them. It misses some great opportunities for big laughs, but does provide plenty of humor.The main reason I am recommending his movie is because of the great performances by the two leads. It's a nice change for Jackman and Ryan is always great in these types of movies. Meyer, who usually does raunchy teen movies, has a lot of funny one-liners (I especially like the line If a man washes a dish and no one sees it, did it really happen?). Schreiber has fun doing physical comedy for once and is also very funny.Although KATE & LEOPOLD is unbelievably far-fetch and misses some great opportunites, it's still an enjoyable and fun romantic comedy.

For the guys who get dragged along to this flick, Meg Ryan provides a touch of class and real comfort for the eyes  -- except for the hair.  Bad hair day doesn't even begin to describe it.  Hollywood seems to have a contest to see who can give her the worst haircut and still have her shine.  This time it looks like someone dropped a haystack on her head -- dry straw hacked to random lengths.

Very well written story and script by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) and  Steven Rogers (Stepmom ).  Kate, Meg Ryan (You've Got Mail)  and her brother Charlie, Breckin Meyer (Clueless) live in N.Y. in the 21st Century. Charlie is an actor. She has dated Stuart, Liev Schreiber (Walking and Talking, Scream) a guy who lives above her apartment. Kate can hear everything that goes on up there. She fights a lot with Stuart. He is very smart and very interested in the topic braking the time barrier.  This movie reminded me of the movie `The Love Letter' with two of the best actors of turn of this century Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh. I have the tape and love that movie. In that movie they can correspond thru this drawer in an antique desk that he bought! In this movie the gap in time near Brooklyn Bridge that Stuart finds.  Stuart goes back to the eighteen hundreds and takes pictures of a party.  Leopold, Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) is a man living in the 1870's.  He sees Stuart's small camera and decides to follow him and they both end up in this century. Leopold is clueless about his new  surroundings.  He gets help and insights from  Charlie, Kate's brother. They exchange lessons in `how to make a woman fall in love with you.' Leopold and Charlie become very close friends.  Charlie makes Leopold realize that he is falling in love with Kate. Leopold is a highly intelligent man and tries his best to learn and even improve the modern conveniences that he encounters such as trying to modify a toaster.  He invented the elevator but somehow his friend, Otis was his name on elevators.  Leopold is a absolute dream of a prince on his white horse. He is smart, romantic, so honorable, polite and has a title also. He represents the best of his civilization!Kate is climbing the corporate ladder in advertising. She represents the best of our civilization! She hired Leopold to be in a commercial. That helped her to get to the top of the ladder, but when she gets there she is no longer interested in it.  Leopold has made Kate reflect upon what is really important in life such as  savoring good food, to enjoy a life style of simplicity and slow pace, sincerity, not to represent a company that he does not believe in among others. Favorite Scenes Kate and Leopold ridding a horse in Central Park. Leopold walking the dog. Leopold finding the place where he kept his treasures. The dinner in the roof full of candles.

It's a film that I can't stop thinking about. The chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan is dynamite. Hugh Jackman (Leopold) is at his best as an English aristocrat. Kate (played by Meg Ryan) is an engaging career woman, who is so accustomed to being treated as a sex object that she is confused and overwhelmed by Leopold's show of respect and good manners. A friend gave me the video, and then I bought the musical score. The first time I saw the film, I was so fixated on Hugh Jackman that I barely noticed the music. Now I keep the CD in my car. The music complements the film's nostalgic setting, mood, and theme. While the entire cast is exceptional, Jackman and Ryan steal the show.

It starts off rather dull, and took me a little while to get into the plot of it all, but when it did, it put a huge smile on my face, that rarely left until the movie was finished. I loved the originality in Kate& Leopold. Having someone love someone, straight from another century, was absolutely brilliant if you ask me. It was great to see two completely different styles, try to mesh with each other. But what benefited the movie most was the believability and conviction Hugh Jackman and Meg shared together. They sizzled with chemistry,they bought in to the idea. Mangold was entering into dangerous territory with this one, due to the silly nature of the plot, but he managed to make it worthwhile, injecting originality, and skill into the whole production. Seeing Hugh Jackman walking around clueless, to all that was going on around him, gave me plenty of chuckles. His suave,well spoken performance was the heart of the film. Okay, so Kate &Leopold isn't the perfect romance film. It drifts off into standard soapy romance, but it has a lot of heart, integrity and so much originality in it, that you won't even care.Performances. Meg Ryan has played this type of role many times before, but she's so charming, she's always able to come out of it looking good, and here is no different. Her charisma carries, what could have been a one-dimensional role, and manages us to make us care for her character. Hugh Jackman is absolutely wonderful as Leopold. It's no wonder why women go crazy over this man. There are not many actors around now a days with his charisma, nor his charm. His suave, sophisticated performance, often highlighted this film. Meg was excellent, but Hugh was the film. Liev Schreiber is decent as Stuart. He has some weird ticks sometimes, but he managed to play his part fairly well. Breckin Meyer is very funny as Charlie. I adored his scenes with Jackman, they were real, and very cute. Natasha Lyonne has a small part as Kate's secretary. She managed to make the most of her part with her likability and enthusiasm. Bradley Whitford plays his role as J.J very well. He was effectively full of himself.Bottom line. Don't let the silliness of the plot scare you off. It's actually very original, and for a 123 minutes, except for the 1st half an hr, it breezes on by. As far as Romantic Comedies go, Kate&Leopold is one of the better ones out there.

Everyone except her gave a sterling performance, Hugh Jackman is phenomenal and the guy who plays Kate's brother is genuinely funny. But if there really exist such women as the one Meg plays here, then I feel very, VERY sorry for American males (and I am female, JFYI). I have had it up my back-teeth (yes, they are really swimming by now) with this neurotic stereotypical New Yorkian females like Kate, where you already know from their first line on that if there is a bed scene she will be on top.I just watched this movie again, and it is so absolutely implausible that a guy like Leopold would truly fall for a female like Kate and vice versa that it just about kills the else entirely charming plot.Now, a Maggie Gyllenhaal probably would not have worked in this movie, but there are loads of actresses who would have been less grating on the nerves, Julia Roberts for instance would have provided a better counterpart to Jackman and unlike Ryan she can act her way out of a paper-bag without enervating everyone on the way.

Similar to the classic fun loving movie Time After Time (1979) along with elements that would be borrowed in Enchanted (2007), Kate and Leopold is a mindless, date movie that offers up just enough of a dumb, predictable comedy but in a fun and charming way that the American or at least our fantasy version of it is fulfilled in this fairy tale sci fi movie.

Films like 27 Dresses and America's Sweethearts, although they can be enjoyable, lack any true emotion and therefore lack a very important element of this genre. Kate & Leopold, although not a perfect film, is one of the more likable ones I have seen recently. It's a simple plot involving Hugh Jackman playing a Duke from the 1700s becoming transported to the 21st century where he meets and eventually falls in love with Meg Ryan. There are plenty of laughs, as usual, in the style of films like Enchanted in which the character finds themselves in situations unlike the ones in their own time and therefore have a hard time adjusting. The film gives us a sense of just how rude and ill-mannered our world is today by contrasting us with the ways of Jackman in the 1700s. Meg Ryan is perfect for this type of film, as usual. Breckin Meyer has a good and funny supporting role as her brother here. It's a pleasure to see a romantic comedy in this century that has true emotion and allows us to care about the characters and want them to be in love. The film gets a little slow in the middle and is therefore not perfect. Nevertheless, this is funny, romantic, and easy to watch. I'd place it up with the better romantic comedies of the decade, such as Hitch and 13 Going on 30. *** out of **** "}{"Title":"It has held up well after eight years!","Date":"1 March 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" Other comments talk about how this film is far fetched or stupid.

After the plot pieces are sloppily set up, however, the charisma of stars Ryan and Jackman take over and almost transcend the fish-out-of-water silliness.

In this respect, I might compare it to the old fashioned fantasy romance Somewhere in Time, where the time travel also leaves much to be desired. I wouldn't expect elaborate technical science fiction explanations in what are essentially romances, but surely the screenwriters could manage something a bit more plausible than the self hypnosis of Somewhere in Time or this film's ridiculous time gap near the Brooklyn Bridge. They either shouldn't be putting this particular movie in the Science Fiction category or else come up with a more plausible mode of time travel. You have to suspend all brain function and logic for this explanation.The plot revolves around a pretty 21st Century advertising executive named Kate, who lives in a New York City apartment with her brother, Charlie. Kate's ex boyfriend, Stuart, who lives upstairs, stumbles upon the time gap hitherto mentioned and travels back to the 1800's where he encounters a European aristocrat named Leopold. Circumstances prove such that Leopold follows Stuart forward to the 21 st Century, and Charlie becomes convinced that, like himself, Leopold is an actor. Confusion and hilarity ensue as Leopold, the proverbial fish out of water, tries to cope with the modern world and, in addition, the chemistry that is developing between him and Kate, who has sort of adopted him and obtained an acting job for him in a commercial.Meg Ryan is her usual charming, endearing self in the role of Kate, and the handsome Hugh Jackman most suitable as the dashing and chivalrous 19th Century Leopold. Supporting cast all seem competent, as I recall. However, I agree with another comment made that Kate swears too much (lazy screenplay writing) and it's odd that Leopold, who's from a more genteel era, seems to indicate no disapproval.For the most part, I actually enjoyed this light hearted bit of fluff, apart from the time travel dimension being silly and unconvincing. I found the plot details quite confusing with regard to the time element, as to exactly what's supposed to be going on here. I would suggest that screenwriters avoid time travel altogether unless they can pull it off a little better, and simply stick with pure comedy romance. This is an entertaining chick flick or a good date movie, but definitely NOT science fiction.

I must muse that it's certainly akin to the 'alchemy' of the modern age...  Pair her with a male co-star who has a similarly engaging presence to the one she possesses herself, and you surely have the recipe for a thoroughly enchanting crowdpleaser.  Tinker with the formula too much and you've got something else on your hands... (it's French Kiss, really, isn't it... ??!)The variation therein that we get here is pleasingly 'offbeat', at times.  Nobody finds much to remark upon about Leopold's distinctive choice of attire or modes of address, and even in his anachronistic ways he is still a delightful companion to the descendants who surround him.  I got the impression it was not 'lazy plotting' that brings this about; more instead a cute acknowledgement of the 'breath of fresh air' that Leopold represents.  Characters are so enamoured by Leopold's old-school charm and grace that they become willingly induced by the fiction they've invented for themselves (he is an 'actor' - implausible as the explanation for EVERY idiosyncrasy that confronts them!)  Facing up to the reality that there's no EARTHLY reason for him to sustain such a facade in times when it provokes unnecessary complications would simply spoil the illusion for them ALL, my deah!!!!It's refreshing in the 'innocent abroad' genre to note that such a character is not parlayed by his creators as being 'dumb' to get more laughs.  Leopold is a man of great intelligence and dignity who nevertheless displays a completely disarming 'boyish enthusiasm' every now and again, played extremely well by Jackman.The whole enterprise can accurately be described as capable, but without too much 'pizzaz'.  There isn't really a crucial event that galvanises the plot into something more.  It can be reduced very basically to an 'opposites attract' theme.  Still, if you're hankering for a recreation of the ole Hanks/Ryan Seattle magic, and Mail disappointingly failed to be delivered straight to your door, Hugh steps into the breach as being very much an able substitute; that is until the baying (and paying!) cinema public almost inevitably increase their demands that the sweetest couple be reunited once more...(6/10, or ***/***** in profile ratings system.)

Kate (Meg Ryan in YET ANOTHER role as the unfulfilled woman who needs her man more than anything, but is still quirky and looks good with artfully tousled hair) is the modern-time woman unhappy with her life she's clumsy, smart at her job, wants a promotion, just broke up with her boyfriend, and her boss is using their working relationship as leverage to get sex.  Leopold (Jackman) is the nineteenth century romantically unsatisfied impoverished aristocrat who is being pressured to contract a marriage for financial profit by his uncle.  When Leopold is brought to the present, these two are attracted to each other but have to adjust to their cultural differences, and at the end Kate follows Leopold back to his time where we are to assume they live happily ever after, until her dark roots start to show and she dies in childbirth (why not?).  I found this premise to be more escapist propaganda about love at first sight and throwing everything away for love &c., and this movie was probably even more annoying than these typically are.  Leopold treats Kate to a weekend of leisure time not unlike what he is accustomed to relaxing, fine food, more relaxing, and drowsing.  All this is supposed to be pleasures from his time period, unlike Kate's and our own rushed time--nothing is said about the terrible poverty of the poor in the Victorian era and how they struggled and suffered (read some Dickens if you can't handle straight history Dickens wrote quite a bit about the Victorian poor and some was based on a youth that included working in a blacking factory as a child).  We are to assume Leopold's leisure time has nothing to do with his own privileged background--maybe his family is hard up for money, but obviously not so much so that they live in squalor and scrounge for food I think it's fair to assume his uncle's idea of poverty means something different than what the actual poor of the time experienced.  Nothing is said about the improved standard of living for the poor in industrialized countries since the Victorian era.  We are just supposed to link Leopold's time to relaxation and Kate's to stress, and her need to be rescued by love. When Kate gets Leopold an acting job in a commercial, he complies until discovering he will have to lie to sell foul-tasting diet slop he confronts her about the innate dishonesty of her job and tells her it is the reason she dreads her work week.  Leopold also openly accuses Kate's boss of sexual harassment, which shames him into giving her the promotion.  By resisting all of her boss's sexual overtures, Kate makes herself seem chaste and therefore appropriate to marry Leopold.  Having broken the glass ceiling, she absconds to the nineteenth century where Leopold decides to marry her (instead of the un-photogenic rich contender his uncle prefers) and ensure poverty for the next generation of his family.  One wonders how her disappearance will be explained--maybe all that policeman who tried to prevent her apparent suicide/jumping to Leopold's time off the bridge girder will remember is how the two men with her, her brother and ex-boyfriend, tried to stop him from stopping her.  Their story will be what?  'We were respecting her decision to throw it all away for the love of a man she met barely a week ago who lives in the past?'  How symbolic is it that the cop assumed Kate was attempting suicide?  How stupid is she to elope with a man (who hadn't actually asked her to marry him before her leap of faith) she's known only a week?  How stupid is he to marry a woman he's known only a week (and has already demonstrated she is willing to lie for money)?  How stupid was I to bother watching it?

It's New York, 1876; the Brooklyn Bridge (which ultimately figures prominently in the plot) is being built, and though John Roebling's `erection' (as it is referred to) is of great interest to Leopold Mountbatten (Jackman), Duke of Albany, there are more pressing matters in his life.  His Uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) is insisting that Leopold choose a bride from amongst the most rich and available of society, and has arranged for a ball to be held at his mansion, at which time his nephew will announce the name of the lucky lady.  At the ball, however, a stranger catches Leopold's eye, who-- when he notices he is being watched-- bolts from the premises with Leopold in pursuit.  The chase takes them to the bridge, whereupon something inexplicable happens, and Leopold suddenly finds himself in New York, 2001, in the apartment of the man he had been chasing, Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber).  Things happen fairly rapidly after that, and very quickly Leopold meets Stuart's ex-girlfriend (who lives upstairs), Kate McKay (Ryan).  And then the real story begins as, not surprisingly (refer to title of film here), Kate and Leopold discover that there may be something more to their chance meeting than just a newly founded friendship.  But there's a problem, and it's a big one  They happen to live in different centuries...	In the final analysis, this mildly diverting, minor romantic fantasy is buoyed by the star power it employs, without which it would barely stay afloat.  Not that it's a `bad' movie, but it suffers from a decided lack of originality in both story and presentation.  Given the concept of the film, it needed an imaginative touch to really make it work, and unfortunately, Mangold was unable to provide it.  And it's a shame, because in Ryan and Jackman he had two of the main ingredients for success, but he failed to make the most of it.  Like mixing metaphors, mixing genres is a hard sell to begin with, and it's imperative that the filmmaker have a definite vision going into such an undertaking; Spike Jonze did with `Being John Malkovich' (from which this film borrows the concept, as well as the context, of the `time portal,') and was successful.  Mangold, however, failed to realize such a vision, and the moment passed him by.	As the Duke, Hugh Jackman gives a convincing performance, complete with a passable British accent.  And you have to give Jackman credit for constantly striving to expand his horizons artistically; he's done science fiction (`X-Men'), romantic comedy (`Someone Like You'), action/thriller (`Swordfish') and now this, which is different still.  Also to his credit, he's done well in them all.  With such a diverse resume, he's already demonstrated his versatility and ability as an actor, and add to that the fact that he has a definite screen presence, and you know-- without a doubt-- that you're looking at a `star' who is only just beginning his ascent, the kind who will bring more than `celebrity' to whatever role he takes on.  Definitely an actor of whom we will be seeing a lot more.	Meg Ryan is a versatile actor, as well, who can do drama (she was outstanding in `When A Man Loves A Woman'), or action/drama (`Proof of Life'), but her forte is romantic comedy (`Sleepless In Seattle,' `You've Got Mail').  As Kate, however, she gets caught up in her character with the same misdirection that characterizes this entire film.  On one hand, Kate is sweet and perky (traits upon which Ryan has successfully capitalized elsewhere), but there is also a more jaded side to Kate, the businesswoman striving to get ahead (More like Diane Keaton's J.C. in `Baby Boom'), and these two sides of Kate's personality, rather than making her a complex character, simply do not seem to gel, and at times the demands of the way in which the character is written takes it's toll on credibility; and in a story like this, the one thing you absolutely need is believable characters, people you can accept as presented.  And there are too many moments in which the side Ryan is attempting to convey seems forced.  I hasten to add that it is not entirely her fault; the character is poorly written, and Mangold did not serve his star well.  It goes back to the vision of the director.  A Nora Ephron, for example, knows how to get the best out of someone like Ryan, whereas Mangold simply does not.	Turning in notable performances in supporting roles are Liev Schreiber, another gifted actor who has yet to have his day in the spotlight (he has one of the best voices in the business, so effective in his terrific portrayal of Orson Welles in `RKO 281'); and Breckin Meyer, convincing as Kate's actor brother, Charlie.	The supporting cast includes Natasha Lyonne (Darci), Bradley Whitford (J.J.), and Philip Bosco (Otis).  The anticipation for this film was high, but ambiguous direction and lack of definition causes `Kate and Leopold' to misfire at just about every turn.  Ryan, Jackman, Schreiber and Meyer deserve better than this, and so does the audience.  The magic just isn't there.  6/10.

What is it about her blue eyes and sunny demeanor that conjures up images of torture so foul that they would make even James Ellroy weep with disgust?  I guess it's because she reminds me of the girls who picked on me in Junior High.  But in any case, that's my problem and not yours.  But what is your problem and indeed everyone's problem is that this woman hasn't been in a decent movie since 1986. (Innerspace)  Can this woman not be stopped?But my gripes with Kate & Leopold spring not from Ryan, but rather its director, James Mangold.  Is the direction of Kate & Leopold bad?  No.  It's like most other films where you don't even notice the technique behind the camera.  My problem stems from his selling out.  Mangold has made two very intelligent and powerful films Heavy and CopLand.  Those films told absorbing stories and were powerfully acted.  He also directed the critically accalaimed Girl, Interrupted, which has not been seen by me at this date.  And he decides to follow these films up with a Meg Ryan romantic comedy?  I will mail the man No-Doz, for he has fallen asleep at the wheel.One of the major plot points in the film involves Ryan's artist ex-boyfriend (Liev Schrieber) who finds a portal off the Brooklyn Bridge into 1876 New York; where he finds Hugh Jackman's Duke of Albany, and brings him to the present, where he can fall in love with Meg.  How does this guy find this damn portal, anyway?  How does he know how long it's gonna be there?  How does he know that jumping back into the waters below the Brooklyn Bridge will get him back to the present?  Where did this guy get his degree in science?  But we aren't supposed to ask these questions.  We're supposed to be lulled to sleep by Meg and Hugh making eyes at each other.But what makes this film plummet from Bad to Downright Insulting is its round-about defense of focus groups in the motion picture industry.  Meg Ryan's character works as an analyst who hands out the questionnaires at the ends of test screenings to find out what people think about the movie.  This chokes the life out of the American Cinema.  As a matter of fact, Mangold himself makes a cameo as a director who shows up at one of the test screenings and tells Ryan's character that.Oh for shame, James.  It's almost as if he's trying to shift the blame from himself to Miramax Films for his movie sucking.  But I blame you,  James.  I blame you for making Natasha Lyonne's indie cred vanish into thin air by casting her in this.  I blame you for further sullying the once good name of Miramax Films.  I blame you for making another Meg Ryan movie.  I blame you for wasting two hours of my life that I will not get back.I blame you, James Mangold.

When he spots a man who seems out of place he gives chase only for the two of them to fall off the partially constructed Brooklyn Bridge. Leopold awakes in the home of the man (Stuart) to find himself in new York of the year 2000. Stuart explains to him his discovery of a time portal that exists between the two times and how they can move between the places in time with relative ease &#150; however Leopold seems equally as intrigued by the modern world around him. On the floor below Stuart lives his ex, Kate, who doesn't believe a word of it. When Stuart falls down a lift shaft it leaves Leopold in the care of Kate, a frosty proposition at best. Meanwhile a little thing called the time-space continuum is starting to show signs of stress.Although it made little at the UK box office, was kicked by critics and unloved by audiences, I decided to give this a go. The film was given its UK terrestrial premier at the same time as one of the World Cup matches on the other side, which shows that the channel in question knew what audience sector it was going to draw &#150; mostly women and one movie geek with a video recorder. The script moves quickly through the hard-to-swallow plot set-up so that we have little time to scoff at it, however it then has to deal with all the fish-out-of-water stuff. It blends from this into the romance of the title towards the inevitable conclusion. None of it is brilliant and parts of it are downright clunky but it does have a certain amount of charm to it. Mangold's direction is patient and avoids the music video montage trap of fish/water stuff or romantic comedies while the script is reasonably good even if it never overcomes the unlikeliness of the whole thing.What carries it is the playing from the cast &#150; or rather the star turn from Jackman. Most famous for this tough turn in action movies, Jackman plays it straight and charming from start to finish &#150; not overdoing anything for laughs or allowing himself to wander too far out of character although the script does push his limits by what it has him do. Ryan is not as good which is a bit ironic since the romantic comedy is where she was forged. She ticks the genre boxes easily enough but she can't convince to the degree that she needed to in order to lift the material. Schreiber has a weak character early on and doesn't do much with it until late in the film where he has at least one good scene. Support is solid enough from Meyer, Lyonne, Gray, Whitford and a few others but really the film belongs to Jackman who leads it with charm and conviction.It isn't a great film and it has a limited appeal and plenty of weaknesses. However having said that it does have a certain style and appeal to it, thanks mainly to Jackman's impressive turn and Mangold's solid direction. Those that hate the genre should avoid it of course but it is a rather charming little thing nonetheless.

It becomes ridiculous. Stuart, the man who brought Leopold to the 21st Century, finds himself detained in a psychiatric ward through a contrived series of events that isn't worth the effort of describing (and it's all played for laughs, even though it isn't the least bit funny), yet for a long, dead stretch of time, the film simply ignores him, in order to concentrate on the courting of his ex-girlfriend Kate, who comes across as the most irritating, shallow, self-absorbed and mean-spirited woman in New York - in addition to being physically unattractive (the plain debutantes we see throwing themselves at an unresponsive Leopold at a Nineteenth-Century ball are far more pleasing to the eye) and not very bright. This woman had nothing to offer Stuart, has nothing to offer Leopold, and has nothing to offer us. She's a waste of everyone's time. We only know she has any importance of any kind because she happens to be played by Meg Ryan, who is, on the strength of films other than this one, a star.Meanwhile, back at the assylum, Stuart meets a gorgeous young woman who (in marked contrast to Kate) actually believes in him. What about THIS romance? It's over before it starts, even though Stuart is far more deserving of happiness (and far more likely to know what to do with it if he finds it) than Kate is. We're told that the failure of the relationship between him and Kate is all his fault, but it's hard to believe if he's absorbed in his work, she's absorbed in HER work, the difference being that while his work is tracking down portals in time for research purposes, hers is tricking the public into buying rubbish. Not enough is made of the vileness of Kate's job. The inevitable scene in which Leopold tells her off for her moral blindness is badly mishandled. What she does may be clearly less wrong than designing weapons for the Pentagon or setting up loans for the World Bank, but it's no less clearly wrong.And what about the time travel? Not only is it (as you'd expect) inconsistent, it is (unlike Back to the Future) inconsistent in a dull and unimaginative way. The immediate effect of taking the inventor of the lift out of the 19th Century is that the lifts stop working. (Yes, I know.) But then, they start working again, and the incident is never referred to again. It's as though the director feels ashamed to have even introduced this plot point in the first place. Rightly so.

Leopold is Titanic's Rose's male counterpart, an elegant, eloquent and veracious person of royal blood and title but having no material wealth, in spite of possessing the supreme wealth of wisdom. He is a connoisseur of art, music, literature, typically seen among the royal breed, and finds it demeaning to cave in to worthless/dubious material. He is also extremely handsome, and ladies swoon aver him, eying, smiling, blushing and giggling when he enters, but they don't interest him. His trip to the 21st century proves to be crucial to his future, because he meets Kate, a worked up modern gal who is not good with men and who can get nasty in her expression, and this results in attraction between the two opposites.Kate and Leopold manages to be better than most average love stories because Meg and Hugh create chemistry in the situations in which they're placed rather than implying that the situations have created a chemistry amongst them. In the recent failure The Bounty Hunter, Gerald and Jennifer do the latter i.e. we see the pair traveling around the country and slowly realizing that they are in love, however, the chemistry there is rather implied than created. While Hugh and Meg handle their characters well enough to blending with the story and gradually getting intimate, and there is not third person to tell us that they are in love (like that stupid old couple in Bounty Hunter), but we feel that intimacy between them.Story wise, Rogers and Mangold circumscribe themselves to a fairy-tale like romantic-comedy that has tremendous potential to be something more. The improbabilities of time-travel aside, we still are left with characters that could have created a universe analogous to an epic Titanic, but instead produce a good chick flick. If going through a time portal is that easy, then the present would have progressed by light years. Just jump off the bridge, get back in time and show the past what can be done in future. Also, the fairytale seems too good to be true, what if Kate was a mental patient who dreamed of finding a suitable man after a failed romance with Stuart, something sinister like Mangold's previous venture Girl, Interrupted? After all, her speech, especially after realizing Leopold's true identity seems somewhat icky and delusional. Then again, we find ourselves glad for Kate and Leopold and are satisfied by the story's linear approach. Maybe if Hugh had given more characterization to Leopold, instead of seeming like a storybook prince, then the movie would have been a shade better. But his act is sincere and believable enough for the movie; Ryan is equally likable, though she does not have much chemistry with the supporting cast as she does with Hugh. Her wry humor helps though. Liev is funny too, maybe too buffoonish and farcical at times while Meyer lends great support throughout. Do not watch Kate and Leopold expecting it to be representative of something vital about society (there are scenes where Leopold seems puzzled at the changing attitudes of women, work and most importantly tastes, though).

However, compared with these films this film plays the comedy to the fore, though making comedic opportunities from a character coming to a different time period to set up a 'fish out of water' is hardly new. The strength of this film is, however, the excellent performances by all of the key cast. Congratulations have to go to Meg Ryan and Leiv Schreiber, who are both charming and funny in their roles without hamming it up too much. However, the real standouts are Brecklin Meyer who is extremely funny as the Meg Ryan's character's brother, but also warm and accessible, and Jackman who is spot on as the 19th century scientifically minded aristocrat who plays his character with bucket's of warmth, charm and integrity. James Mangold's directing is understated and he wisely allows the actor's to shine. He also doesn't really emphasise the more serious considerations about time travel, a weakness in a lot of films in this genre, and Schreiber's character's connection to Jackman's character is insufficiently fleshed out. Technically the film is very polished, with impressive photography (by Stuart Dryburgh), and a enjoyable score by Rolfe Kent. Sting's song Until won a Golden Globe for best song. The film's ending is clichéd but emotionally satisfying and makes for an enjoyable experience, if hardly a profound one.

His ex girlfriend on the other hand is tired of him and she is a rather cynical businesswoman who is looking for a suitable actor to star in her Farmers Bounty advert,and she swore off men since her breakup with Stuart.Leopold however at first struggles to come to terms with our society but he quickly overcomes this and decides to dress like his from the 21st century resulting in him to be mistaken for just an actor as Kate's brother Charlie(Breckin Meyer)meets Leopold later in the film. But when Leopold meets Kate later on in the film (as Stuart ends up being gone from the story for a very long time thanks to having no elevators since Leopold is the inventor of elevators BTW) romance blossoms between Leopold and Kate(even though when Kate first meets Leopold she doesn't believe for a second that he is who he says he is a 19th Century bachelor who was transported from 1876 to 2001,and she thinks his too good to be true). Leopold however gets on so well with Kate's younger brother Charlie who helps him out with winning a girl called Patrice, and later Leopold saves Kate's purse,and then he sweeps her off her feet with a romantic candlelit dinner on the top of the apartment building and he of course falls in love with Kate. So will he and Kate ever get together,and will Leopold either stay in the year 2001 or 1876?Bottom line I really enjoyed this film in actual fact I consider this film one of my favorite movies of all time as well as it being a guilt pleasure too as it reminded me of that 2007 film Enchanted. The main reason why I loved this movie was because of one actor Hugh Jackman. He just took this movie and made it his own. His charisma and persona lit up the screen every time he shows up with Meg Ryan(who was one of my favorite actresses as a kid)and his character Leopold was like a Disney prince for the older audience. As for the rest of the film yes its a tad but stupid with a very contrived plot but like I said I really enjoyed it,between the chemistry with Ryan & Jackman as they were funny and sweet together not to mention Jackman's character Leopold is so dashing you can't help but fall head over heels in love for the guy. The music by Rolf Kent was nice as it fit the mood of the movie,so was the cinematography where it starts off in old New York City for like 10 minutes and then it goes into modern day New York City in 2001 and of course the finale of the movie was a bit silly as (spoiler alert)Meg Ryan ends up going back to 1876 as she was in the photos her ex boyfriend Stuart took while he was in the year 1876 at the beginning of the movie and Kate ends up been chosen as Leopold's bride at the end. But having said that it was a harmless sweet romantic film with that Cinderella vibe to it mixed with old- fashioned romance which I haven't witnessed in a romantic film in a very long time. Also the romance like I have mentioned was slow paced yet you knew when Leopold was going to fall for Kate as they were destined to be together.Best part Hugh Jackman wooing Meg Ryan over and tries to propose to her character as they listen to that Breakfast At Tiffany's song Moon River but for me it has to be the chasing scene with the thief stealing Kate's handbag and Leopold saves it for her by riding on a horse saying 'give me your hand,your hand woman'. Hilarious stuff.Worst Part The whole time traveling thing was kinda stupid and the plot is OK as you need to be able to follow the plot and take all in once you watch this film,especially as it repeats itself when Leopold goes back to his world and he has to relive the previous day all over again.VerdictA nice heartfelt,harmless fantasy that will leave a sense of love and warmth after you have seen it and stars a very charming man indeed.Rating B- 6.9/10A feel good movieEdited on 25/03/2016 as I seen it last night and I had to tweak the review for it.

Her ex-boyfriend, Stuart (Liev Schrieber) still lives in her apartment building and is a constant reminder to her of what went wrong. One day, however, Stuart has a new roommate named Leopold (Hugh Jackman) who is a bit unusual to say the least. His clothes are from another century and so are his impeccable manners. This is because he actually IS from another century! It seems Stuart found a time warp near the Brooklyn bridge and brought someone back on his latest trip. Kate, who is in advertising, sees Leopold as a great spokesperson for a butter company and arranges some new commercials. Leo is a big hit! But, he really wants to return to his own time. Admittedly, he and Kate have become very close, so how can there possibly be a happily ever after scenario? This is one of the best modern-day romantic comedies out there. The cast is wonderful, with Breckin Meyer adding to the fun as Kate's offbeat brother. The costumes are lovely, as is the setting in New York and the other production values. Then, too, the script is imaginative and romantic to the core. A love that will transcend the boundaries of time and space is a true love indeed. Gentleman, if you want to give your partner a great gift on Valentine's Day or any day, find this movie to share with your beloved. As you hold hands on the sofa, you will find her inching closer to you by the minute and smiling to beat the band.

Either they've incorporated some nifty historical references or they faked it. Either way, it added an elegance sorely missing in may films of this genre.The casting was first rate. Jackman was superb as was Liev Schreiber who played the time traveler/ex-boy friend. Breckin Meyer, Kate's brother Charlie played his supporting character smoothly, energetically, and more than held his own. Actually, I thought Meg Ryan was the weakest link, playing her average heroine character, but she was adequate enough that the others elevated the scenes she was in.Liev Schreiber keep making me think of Albert Brooks but without the cloying sense of self Brooks employs.I could have lived without the clichéd part of the ending (involving a taxi cab ride). Additionally, there were a few perfunctory scenes that could have used a little more creative thought, but the male characters were so engaging the little flaws didn't really matter. Incidentally, those scenes wouldn't have stood out except that so many other scenes were done so cleverly.Leopold, in the present day, teaches us about the importance of grace and style from a time that we have dismissed, even ridiculed, in favor of an empty, tasteless pursuit for material goods over spiritual wealth.The majestic bridge that is the focal point of the opening celebration is now relegated to being just a bridge to us while Leopold sees it as a masterpiece that has withstood the test of time. In a nearly unisex world he, alone, cherishes the fairer sex and love, over sex and money.Not only is he a reminder of what once was, but he touches and improves everyone he encounters. In conclusion, we like to think we have come so far from the 19th Century, but maybe that distant we've covered was in the wrong direction.

You mean I wasn't supposed to?  Oh dear.  First of all, it bears an amazing resemblance to Jude Devereaux's romance novel A Knight in Shining Armor so much so that I was surprised that this book was never mentioned in the credits.  The scene of going to an historical home that was once the abode of the main character, and that character knowing exactly where a 'secret' panel was behind the wall, which contained 'treasures' from the past, is straight out of the above-mentioned book.                                                                                 I also found similarities with that very good film of Malcom McDowall/Mary Steenburgen's called, I believe, Time After Time, where H.G. Wells traveled to modern day San Francisco, only to find true love and bring his modern-day gal back to Victorian London with him.  Since, in real life apparently, H.G. Wells was married to a very modern 'ahead-of-her-time' feminist woman, this was a charming little twist.  One can easily imagine Kate in this film also bringing her 'modern' ideas about women in society to stodgy old Victorian New York, and shaking things up a bit.  Perhaps along the lines of novelist Edith Wharton.                             Also, there is nothing to suggest that these 'time-travelers' will be forever stuck in one place in time.  I assume if the scientist (Kate's ex-boyfriend) figured out how to access a portal in time once, he can do it again.  And again.  And again.                                                         See, at no time was I muddled, it all made perfect sense to me.  -)  And since I myself am over 40, stuck in a career path that no longer interests me, and sick to death sometimes of the tediousness of the Rat Race, I have no quarrel with a woman who is suddenly confronted with a man so drop-dead sexy (and who can sing and dance too, by golly) that she chucks off her boring life with hardly a blink of an eye, and takes a Leap of Faith that somewhere, anywhere, is probably better than what she already knows.  At least she won't be bored.                                                        Unrealistic?  Not at all.  Kate will be appalled at the horrors confronting the working-classes in the urban 19th Century, and will become known for her innovations as a social worker.  Leopold will realize he's going to have to work for a living, and hence he turns his invention of an Elevator into reality.  Who knows, he might invent a lot more things, considering that Kate will be able to give him lots of good ideas.  This sort of thing was played up with charming effect in Peggy Sue Got Married.  I'm buying all of this, I'm telling you.                           When Kate becomes pregnant, and realizes there are complications, Leopold will simply pick her up in his big strong arms and leap off of the nearest bridge through the next oncoming time portal, and save the day.  No, really.  This is a lovely, fun, enchanting movie!

The goal of the romance is to get the viewer to want the characters to be together, but too often actors are matched based on their box office profitability, not whether they can make a connection between them. But every so often, a movie comes along that actually picks actors that work well with each other. This is one of them.In 1876, Leopold (Hugh Jackman), the Duke of Albany, is being pressured to marry for the sake of bringing cash to his name. But the arrogant and proper Duke wants to wait for love. At the dance where he's supposed to choose a wife, he sees something strange. A man (Liev Schrieber) has been taking pictures of him all day with a tiny little camera. Leopold follows the man, and ends up in 2001. While there, he meets, and subsequently falls for, the man's ex-girlfriend, Kate McCoy (Meg Ryan).This is not a departure for Meg Ryan in the least. The blonde actress has made a career out of these kinds of movies, and while she's ventured elsewhere a number of times, this is where she's always been home. What's surprising about her performance in this movie is that she's a little flat, and is outshone by her co-star, Hugh Jackman, who is positively irresistible. Cultured, sweet and polite, Jackman dominates the role and walks away with the film. Jackman is a great actor, but this is easily his best performance. Schrieber and Breckin Meyer, as Kate's brother, provide comic relief, but this is Jackman's show.This is a solid, but overlong romance. It has all the requisite elements likable characters, good humor, and smoldering chemistry between the leads. But it's way too long, and the film loses a lot of its vitality whenever Jackman isn't around.Still, if you're looking for a good date movie, Kate & Leopold is a great option.

Hugh Jackman portrays Leopold. Sketching the ceremony of the erection of a New York bridge, he turns to see someone acting strangely. Overcome with curiosity, he pursues Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber at his quirky best), inadvertently into the year 2001. Stuart's sudden disappearance from his apartment brings his downstairs neighbor, Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), into Leopold's life and helps him adjust to this jolt into the future.Hugh Jackman is brilliant and commanding. Meg Ryan, at 39, who has just wasted the best years of her life to Stuart, her ex-boyfriend, has given up on love. Her acting brother, Charlie (Breckin Myer) arrives to visit and adds another dash of comedic flavor to the mix.Without giving away any part of the story, I will leave you with some of the most poignant moments that I found very appealing.There is an huge container of pens in front of Leopold, but he has no idea what they are. He finds a feather among a container of craft items, makes some ink in a glass, and sits down to compose a letter. He lightly blows air on the completely letter, slowly blinks his eyes and re-reads the letter.Although I am dismayed at Meg Ryan's choice to alter her lips and cheeks cosmetically, I applaud her decision to forgo an abundance of makeup. As Kate, she looks tired and overworked, true to the character of a marketing executive who works long hours and has no personal life. Kate's reaction to a line in French, when it's full meaning was interpreted to her, and the expression on her face at a surprise meal, was adorable. And that's the reason audiences respond to Meg Ryan so well. She has an inner beauty and glow that needs no cosmetic enhancements.Liev Schreiber exhaustingly tries to explain his theory of the space/time continuum to a young lady. His facial expressions and gestures as Stuart are absolutely hysterical but the young lady finally gets what he's saying. Just thinking about this witty big of dialog makes me smile. I can see a little bit of Charlie Chaplin incorporated into Schreiber's physical portrayal so I wonder if Schreiber was an admiring fan of Chaplin's? A sweet homage.Guys if you're looking for science fiction, go to the search box at IMDb.com and look for something else. If you want to curl up with your girl, put the popcorn in the microwave and put the DVD or videotape of Kate & Leopold in the machine! Enjoy.

Kate and Leopold is just that sort of movie--it's all the way through your brain's digestive tract the second the abbreviated and ad-cluttered credits on TBS begin rolling. I taped it off TV last week and figured, what the heck, how bad can it be? Well, K/L isn't bad (Quentin Tarantino movies are bad; cheating on your wife is bad, believing the mainstream media is just plain stupid . . . and bad), but you have to know what you're getting into with this hopelessly cutsie time-traveling chick flick. The details of how British nobleman Hugh Jackman jumps from 1876 to 2001 defy logic (and aren't even really explored), Meg Ryan's used as a vehicle (and what a chassis!) for lots of fashions and a pretty cool haircut, and the rest of the cast is filled with stock characters doing stock things.I called it a chick flick and that's what's wrong with Kate and Leopold. It could have been so much more. Jackman, who has quite possibly the best voice since Sean Connery in Marnie, never really breaks out of the part of honorable English aristocrat. If the time-travel aspect had been explored more, he would be an honorable aristocrat 125 years out of time! K/L could have been a love story and a satire on our cultural self-demolition. Instead, all we get is the occasional wheezy joke about operating dishwashers and picking up dog poop.Ryan just gets sexier with every year (and at 39, when this film was made, there were complaints about her playing the same character over and over), but there's an actress, a really good actress under that soft voice and perky bounce and it would be nice if, by the time she turns 50, she plays something deadly serious and seriously real.With the edited version on TV, I figured it would be alright if my 10-year-old sit in (she isn't aware of the dubbed Shoots! and Fudges! I can hear from years of watching movies on TV) and, golldangit, she loved it! She thought Jackman was nice and Ryan was pretty, she laughed at the jokes, cuddled during the scary parts, and asked me to pull the tab off the tape.I thought the movie was two hours of mindlessness, but the kid declared, It's a keeper!Maybe Kate and Leopold isn't inconsequential to everyone?

All Leopold's pronouncements about the integrity of advertising and how a meal should be savoured, are presented as evidence of his belonging to a previous, more civilized age. In fact they are the result of the fact that he belongs to an extremely privileged class. I don't suppose the Industrial workers starving in the slums of C19th Manchester did much standing up when a woman left the table, or taking time to savour the flavour of their butter.That's not the worst of it, though. Leopold is shocked that Kate is going to go on a date without a chaperone, that she has never been properly wooed in candle light with a violinist in attendance, and that she is entertaining a slimy boss who is offering her a job but also hoping to make her. How quaintly anachronistic of him, and how charming his manners are, and how we cheer when she gives up her career to follow him back in time. The fact that she goes back to a society where she doesn't have a right to a Vote, let alone a job, to a marriage where her property automatically becomes her husband's and she no longer has any control over it whatsoever, and where Leopold can physically beat her without any legal comeback, is curiously not explored.The advances of the C20th were social as well as technological, although you wouldn't know it watching this film, and indeed there are points where it seems like an anti-feminist manifesto. I don't care how tasty Hugh Jackman is, if my basic human rights are the price I have to pay for luurve, then I'll stay single, thank you very much!If you want an antidote to this crap, I suggest you watch Gaslight (1940) - Anton Walbrook is every bit as sexy as Hugh, and Diana Wynyard hasn't done anything un-natural to her lips - ahhh! the charm of a more civilized age!

I could have watched Star Trek The Wrath of Khan. I could have watched 13 going on 30, which is only a smidgen better than this film. Unfortunately, my hate for this movie cannot be summed up in one measly post. I am posting this to let the world of IMDb users know that I have contempt for this film. I shudder to think which users gave this movie a vote of 10. I gave this movie a vote of 1. That is all I have to say.--QT is a god.

Oh, and she's rather needy and self-absorbed, too. It takes a guy who is 100 years out of his time to make her realize this, and to make her come to the conclusion that she'd be happier in a world where not only is there no rat race, but no rights for women. She just needs a man, darnit! She doesn't need to maybe find the right career for her skills, or maybe choose a slower-paced life in her own time... no, she just has to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to a time when women didn't even have the vote, in order to be happy.Right. I can't begin to effectively express my contempt for this movie.

This film makes an even worse social statement than Shallow Hal, a film in which the most shallow person is the morbidly obese woman Hal falls in love with.Since the castration of the modern male by the onset of feminism gone wrong, men have become far more sensitive and considerate than anyone ever wants to admit. It might be argued men were always more sensitive, if you look at the poets, writers and musicians of the classical era.It's women, in fact, who've become aggressive, arrogant, and completely lost consideration for the feelings of men.So I find it offensive Hollywood is churning out movies like this, where a gentleman from the past tries to show us what jerks modern men are; it's modern women who've lost all sense of compassion and common decency, who could take some lessons from a true lady.I was utterly appalled by this movie, the worst since the outrage that was Pretty Woman. Why does it appear that every woman, despite being horribly self serving and inconsiderate, seems to believe she deserves a handsome prince charming? Movies like this only help perpetuate that utterly outrageous (and unfair to men) dream. "}]
