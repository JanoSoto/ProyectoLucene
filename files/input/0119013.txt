[{"Title":"Entertainingly overblown action marred by slapdash storytelling","Date":"11 January 2000","Score":"20 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The script for Double Team was originally called The Colony and by several accounts, it was actually quite good. Apparently, it went through many major alterations on its way to production until the final product bore little resemblance in tone and quality to the original script. Does this mean Double Team is a disaster? Not really, but its clear all the changes created some problems.On the one hand, you have the participation of famed Hong Kong director Tsui Hark and world-class cinematographer Peter Pau. They manage to create some of the coolest, trippiest, most fantastical visuals this side of a MTV video and better still, do so without the excessively choppy editing that usually accompanies MTV-style films. You actually get to appreciate the luxuriously-shot images, though the film is by no means slow-paced. Better still, it's one of the few Van Damme movies that realizes the best Van Damme movies are the ones which absolutely never rely on Van Damme's acting (or anyone else's for that matter) to carry the film along. It's all action, goofily entertaining plot twists, and sweet visuals. As an action-packed, overblown, eye-candy fantasy, Double Team works very well.On the other hand, it's painfully obvious that Double Team used to have a smarter script which called for a far more subtle and serious approach. Had these intelligent elements been completely erased or dumbed-down for the final product, this wouldn't have been a problem. However, it seems that some of the more subtle plot developments were left in and they do NOT mesh well with Tsui's and the rest of the final script's jackhammer approach to the story. For example, at one point a prescription label left on the wall is supposed to be noticed by Van Damme's character who then uses the name of the doctor on the label as a clue. However, unless you're paying very very close attention you'd never know that. It's so small on screen, the label may as well have been blank. And the shot where the label is taken off the prescription bottle is far too quick and unclear. A single extra shot showing a closeup of the label would've cleared things up immensely. But it never happens. The film contains several instances like this where a single clarifying shot or an extra line of explanatory dialogue would've made things much clearer. The result is that what seem like glaring plot holes (even for this kind of movie) are in fact due to badly explained plot points. Such an obscure presentation might have worked on a quieter, more intelligent spy film where the audience knows they aren't going to be spoon-fed the plot. But after 40 minutes of terrible one-liners and ridiculous action, the last thing that should be required of Double Team's audience is to suddenly pay close attention to what's happening.I don't know whether Tsui Hark was trying to keep in some subtle elements while reconciling it with the rapid-fire approach, or whether he just didn't care about such details and wanted to keep things moving (Probably the latter, as his subsequent movie, Knock Off, experimented with this abstract, to-hell-with-storytelling visual approach to the nth degree). Whatever the case, the result is a pretty wild but somewhat confusing action movie that could've been much better with minor changes.

John Woo must have gotten lucky when he went to Hollywood Ringo Lam is still making Van Damme movies, and Tsui Hark went back to Hong Kong after this and 'Knock Off'. I have nothing against Van Damme, but he seems to be some sort of trial-by-fire for any Hong Kong director with ambitions of making action films in Hollywood If a director succeeds, he go on to Dolph Lundgren and then mainstream Hollywood action (John Woo), otherwise the director is faced with sticking with Van Damme movies or going back to Hong Kong.Counter-terrorist Jack Quinn (Van Damme) is planning to retire after one final mission to nail the villainous Stavros (Mickey Rourke). The mission goes incredibly wrong Stravos gets away, but somehow his son is killed in the cross-fire. Out for revenge, Stavros kidnaps the pregnant Kathryn Quinn (Natacha Lindinger), and the only way Jack can save is wife is team up with Yaz (Dennis Rodman) and kick-box his way to a happy ending.Watching 'Double Team', I thought it was pretty clear than even Van Damme realizes that his movies are a joke to all but the most hardcore of action fans. Australian sketch comedy show 'Full Frontal' (featuring a not-so-famous Eric Bana) regularly took stabs at Van Damme for a good year or so (YOU LAUGHTER CRACKIN' AT ME? ARRRGGGHHHHH!), coincidentally around when 'Double Team' would have been released. At no point does 'Double Team' make any attempt to be taken as a serious action movie. All the fight scenes are played for laughs, if only slight chuckles. Van Damme gets to fight a tiger and use a coke-machine to shield himself from an explosion. All it really amounts to be is 90 minutes of action fun.While fans of director Tsui Hark would be disappointed with this effort, something good came of Hark's short-lived collaborations with Van Damme He went back to Hong Kong and directed the incredibly awesome 'Time and Tide' (which did not feature Jean-Claude Van Damme at all).'Double Team' doesn't come to close to being one of Van Damme's best, and it might not even please hard-core Van Damme fans, but its all in good fun - 5/10 "},{"Title":"A fantastic film for the high intensity, action enthusiast!","Date":"13 January 2002","Score":"17 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  His on-the-court abilities envied (no, I didn't say his personality) by most aspiring NBA forwards, Dennis Rodman teams up with the envy of most men, and the heart throb of most women, Jean-Claude Van Damme, in a high intensity, destroy everything in the way, movie! Backed by a stellar performance by Mickey Rourke, the trio do well at keeping you on the edge.Did you ever think that Dennis Rodman might one day make good as an actor? Neither did I, but when the perfect part is filled by the perfect character, anything is possible. Dennis portrays a quirky, black market arms dealer. He also happens to know counter-terrorist, Jean-Claude Van Damme, pretty well.Opening scenes display a normal evening of crowds, laughter, and screams of enjoyment and thrills. These typical carnival sounds are soon stifled by screams of terror as automatic weapons are opened up on the crowd. Van Damme is on the scene, however. He chases down the villain, Rourke in a multi level building (looked like a hospital). Windows exploded as bullets wized through them from all directions. grenades tossed by Rourke destroyed all in their path. Just as Van Damme gets Rourke cornered, the villain slips into a nursery full of baby beds.Rourke uses Van Damme's weakness for valuing human life against him here. Using two well placed incendiary grenades Rourke kills agent Van Damme in the dual. Leaving behind a pregnant wife, Van Damme is dead to the outside world. The agency for which he works, has him recovering on a remote and top secret island.Here he is to track the world's most nefarious terrorists (by way of a massive satellite computer) and offer advice to agencies on how to capture or destroy them. Van Damme is also informed that he may never leave the island and must report to a fingerprint screen at certain times of the day in his room in order that his constant presence may be accounted for. A violation of the rules set forth on the island would be cause for his actual termination from existence.Passion for regaining control of his life, and a deep, bitter sense of revenge against Rourke are all that he can focus on as he continues to recover from wounds and works to strengthen his body again.O-kay, where does Dennis Rodman come into the picture, you may be asking. No man can always stand alone. Watch and discover how Van Damme plans his escape back to real life, and what part Dennis will play in taking down his arch nemesis, Rourke.I love Van Damme movies. I pretty much enjoy most martial artist flicks, though. Stellar performances by Van Damme and Rourke as usual, backed by a surprisingly great performance by an unlikely star, as well as lots of fast-paced action, kept me in tune with the movie right from the start,and all the way to the closing credits! A fantastic film for the high intensity, action enthusiast!

Pleasure.","Date":"17 July 2009","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" Despite the strong start, Van Damme movies certainly fell off in quality as the 90's went on. DOUBLE TEAM is easily one of his lesser efforts despite some inspired casting and a few somewhat new ideas. Unfortunately, you've seen almost all of it before, including the name, which is almost indistinguishable from DOUBLE IMPACT or DEATH WARRANT. The idea of Van Damme teaming up with Dennis Rodman is so ludicrous that it's worthwhile for novelty&#x85; and the icing on the cake is that the two team up against Mickey Rourke&#x85; and have a 3-way shirtless fistfight in what I assume is supposed to be the Roman Coliseum (plenty of shades of RETURN OF THE DRAGON) at the end too&#x85; with a Tiger and landmines to boot! Well, the overall plot about Van Damme's pregnant wife getting kidnapped so Rourke can replace his adopted son with Van Damme's (?) doesn't amount to a hill of beans and quite poorly links together its many action sequences. The only neat non-action bit is a long section dealing with Van Damme going off the grid and joining a colony of other former CIA agents who have faked their own deaths. The flipside is that this lifestyle isn't quite utopic and ends up being a prison (a la The Prisoner) for Van Damme as he's playing the same revenge-driven character he always plays. Rourke and Rodman are equally 1-dimensional and Rodman manages to change his costume (and hairstyle) repeatedly between scenes which supposedly take place on the same day! It turns out that the whole faking-his-death thing was completely pointless as the first thing Van Damme does when he escapes it to lure Rourke into a trap which he blows right away once he spots his wife and tries to run after her&#x85; but whatever, we're not in this sort of thing because of the story. We're here to see Van Damme kick people in the face and break things. Unfortunately it's marred heavily with lots of intentional humor and bad basketball-related one-liners from Rodman's character, who I'm pretty sure isn't far different from Rodman himself. See? If your actors can't act, just not have them even bother trying to take on characters. Works like a charm.Fans of Italian crime and action movies will have a field day spotting cameos by some genre stalwarts. Bruno Bilotta (aka Karl Landgren), star of numerous poor 80's exploitation films, plays Rourke's main sniper and even scores a fight scene with Van Damme! Ottaviano Dell'Acqua plays a random Italian agent gunned down in glorious slow motion while Angelo Ragusa gets stabbed in the back and shot by a pair of not-so-helpless women. Ted Rusoff (a perennial figure in the world of ADR and voice dubbing going back to the AIP days of Samuel Z. Arkoff) plays a monk for the umpteenth time and even eurocrime great Orso Maria Guerrini is wasted in a nothing background role with no lines! This is no exception to the endless cycle of Van Damme teaming up with Hong Kong directors to attempt to repeat the same success as HARD TARGET and do for the likes of Ringo Lam what that film did for John Woo. Director Tsui Hark makes sure to throw in some patented kung fu fight scenes complete with plenty of gunplay, knifeplay, and attempts at strangulation. Add to that a complete overboard use of dutch angles and requisite poor CGI to make one generic 90's action movie experience complete! Worth it just to see Van Damme side-kick a growling tiger in the face, even if it does seem more the work of VFX than choreography.

But Double Team sounded the Death Knell for Van Damme's movie career, which was finished off and consigned to direct-to-video Hell by Hark's follow up Knock Off in 1998. (Although I felt that Knock Off was mildly enjoyable, Hark's off-kilter approach and the 3rd rate screenplay made it tank big-time with American audiences). It's not that the movie itself was all that bad to look at.It's obviously the work of professionals. The hyper-kinetic camera work and meth-driven action sequences are pretty much what we've come to expect from Hark and his colleagues, there's some reasonably witty give and take in the dialog, a few decent one liners, etc., the actors are reasonably buff, etc. I tried to take all this into account, and all these mitigating elements help a little, but in the end, Double Team is obviously the Beginning Of The End. Why?? Well, we've always known the Van Damme isn't an Actor, he's a Body (like, say, Marc Singer in Beast Master). He's only believable in a limited range of roles, and he's very limited in his dramatic range of emotions ( the thick accent has always been a hindrance ). And Double Team pretty much signaled that Hollywood had run out of things to do with him, that his fan base and audience was pretty much played out, and that every VD film from now on would be a retread or a derivative, 2nd rate mishegoss. Three major directors had made a shot at bringing him into the mainstream (Hard Target, Time Cop, and Sudden Death), and Van Damme had been decent-to-excellent in all of them...but all those directors had moved on and Van Damme was now back to making B movie fodder. Or in the case of Double Team a 'freak show buddy movie' whose gimmick was that it starred Dennis Rodman as a giant Dennis Rodman. Rodman's whole gimmick as a celebrity (as opposed to his inarguable talent as a pro basketball player) is that he is outrageous, and the movie stops repeatedly to let him BE outrageous, with various hi tech gimmicks and basketball-themed weapons that seemed to have been invented by your ninth-grade nephew. There are some potentially funny and incisive lines , but the delivery (by both Van Damme and Rodman) pretty much just lies there. Van Damme is particularly off in this movie, like he's just going through the motions until his hangover subsides or something. So it's not a real movie, but just a strung together series of set pieces with testosterone-fueled muscle flexing and an almost complete lack of actual human emotion or feeling. Oh, a certain kind of audience will love this kind of thing, but somehow, this particular movie seemed to permanently typecast Van Damme as a 2nd rater, a hack actor in the same vein as Rutger Hauer, Dolph Lundgren and, yes, Steven Seagal...All these actors also started off with a big splash in well designed vehicles that showcased their talents...and then faded into B-to-Z movie hackdom as the casting agencies and action directors moved on to other, fresher faces. For all his limitations as an actor and an action star, I've always enjoyed Van Damme - he's good looking, he is capable of mild wit and self deprecating humor, and he works hard at maintaining his physique in a career phase where a lot of his action star peers from the same period have let themselves go and have to suck their guts in and hope for a good camera angle.

Normally, I would not give this kind of movie much of a chance, but it lured me in over some free time on a Sunday.I've liked Van Damme, but also thought he was terribly cheesy. This film showcases enough of the positives. In 1997, Van Damme was still a viable commodity, and takes this role seriously, and goes through a clichéd but well-executed transformation from down-and-out to powerful avenger. THe fight sequences are exciting and executed in a top-notch manner.The film is redeemed greatly by Mickey Rourke, who plays a brilliant villain, and this film seems to have been shot before his plastic surgery, and makes you wonder again what he was ever thinking to go through with that surgery, because his charisma just explodes off the screen.The film starts terribly weak, but gains momentum midpoint and ends well, differing from the huge majority of failed films that start strong and dwindle to a weak end. THis is its greatest liability. It simply seems so ridiculous at the start, and Rodman, not a professional actor, starts quite weak, but seems at least mostly credible by the end of the film. By the end of the film, I actually bought Rodman as an actor and was ready to see more, at least in a supporting role.THe film has some original set pieces, and what seem like reasonably advanced effects, and well-executed action sequences, that were clearly done by a more professional team than an average B movie would warrant. Of course, this wasn't meant to be a B movie at the time, and clearly had a decent budget that I doubt was recouped. There are also some odd references to the KAL shoot down of the 1980s that I was really surprised made it into this film, which gave it a brief air of credibility in the political science realm.Anyway, far from a masterpiece, and fairly clichéd, but genuinely entertaining if given a chance.

Instead we have Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dennis Rodman teamed up in one of the more unusual movie pairings I've seen lately. Mickey Rourke, despite looking very out of place in a movie like this, plays a decent villain to menace Van Damme and his family. The one-liners suck, the acting is pretty bad, and in case you didn't get the idea from my first paragraph, this movie is completely stupid.But, hell. Hilariously stupid things like that are one of the reasons why I watch Van Damme movies. Tsui Hark, like the other two major Hong Kong cult legends who ran to Hollywood in the 90's (John Woo and Ringo Lam), Hark's first task in Hollywood is to work with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Apparently he was the default actor for these kinds of things. At least Hark did what he could with this movie--he delivered some great camera-work, stuntwork, and typical action movie mayhem a little higher in quality than this film deserves.The movie's worth watching for its entertaining ridiculousness and above-average direction. The rest of it is pretty underwhelming. Van Damme and Rourke more-or-less go through the movements, when we all know they're a lot more fun to watch when they're given something to do in whatever else we've seen them in. But anyway, if you're looking for a less-popular Van Damme movie that's so bad it's good, check this one out. Anyone else, give it a rental, or skip it, I guess.That Coke machine scene alone should be justification enough to sit through this movie. Who knows, you might have a blast.

Van Damme's pregnant wife is his target. Dennis Rodman becomes his partner to uphold the lackluster title. Suffering from bad acting and a complete lack of common sense unleashing fine visual elements. Good setup directed by Tsui Hark at a slam banging speed with Van Damme playing every character he has played before. His competition in the realms of overacting is Rodman who should really stick to sports. Together they prove that two people can create twice as much numbing violence as one person and with twice the idiocy. Mickey Rourke and Paul Freeman also appear in this idiotic junk. Natacha Lindinger plays Van Damme's wife who is placed in pearl although being cast in this farce puts her in pearl enough. One will learn quickly through one viewing is that a lot of money goes into creating the stupidity presented here. It is all action with the Rodman billing to capitalize upon his celebrity in sports entertainment. The result is a film that should definitely be doubled teamed and the best image would be to place it on a football field while everyone goes for the tackle.

It seems as if the focus is on showing the audience what a cool guy Rodman is and what a hard and powerful guy van Damme is. The story is therefor not so necessary. The main characters are even for a action-movie niggling. There are the supporting characters quit more interesting like a martial-arts fighter in the hotel with a knife between his toes or the character of Goldsmythe, awesome played by Paul Freeman. But as I said, this movie was made for van Damme and Rodman and not for actors.The action-scenes are moving between already seen in other action-movies and ridiculous.

I have literally seen three dozen of those movies and it boggles my mind that my movie-loving and professional critic friends aren't tired of that cliché.Hell, even in 1997, when this came out, it was overdone.I digress, our homophobic hero does sometimes team up with a flamboyant somewhat bad/good guy to take down a big-bad guy in Europe. That other part of the movie title's team will make tons of basketball references even though his character's not tied to the sport.At any rate, the movie drudges on with poor dubbing, unrealistic and mismanaged scenes that mean nothing and a climax that should make any parent cringe with the child abuse.This movie doesn't even fall into the so-bad, it's good. It's just doubly bad.* * * Final thoughts I make this excuse a lot. But, I only saw this because of the How Did This Get Made? podcast.

The things he can do, with his better-than-average flexibility, seem so acrobatically impossible that it hurts just to write about them. It's cool, that with Van Damme's martial arts background - a black belt in Shotokan Karate, several middleweight full-contact Karate titles, and training in ballet (yes, ballet), which makes his kicks and flexibility defy normal-person standards (not to mention the fact that's he's just one of the most impressively-built men in the world) - his film career would pan out better.Double Team, directed by the Hong Kong veteran Tsui Hark, is Van Damme's first foray into the world of Asian/American cinema. Double Team has an astounding production but that's about it. In a globe-spanning odyssey from Spain, to somewhere in the Mediterranean and finally to the Roman Coliseum, you would expect Double Team to be fast & furious Hollywood/Hong Kong action of the first degree. But it's not. The plot is incoherent and insensible, with even worse script-writing and acting (the last is a moot point, but you understand).Van Damme is Jack Quinn, one of the world's leading counter-terrorist experts, who is leading an operation to nab master terrorist Stavros (a plastic-looking Mickey Rourke). When the bust goes down, lots of explosions and gunfire, and in the ensuing chaos, Stavros's wife and young son are killed. A martial arts fight breaks out between Quinn and Stavros but Stavros escapes, and Quinn is badly injured during the course of Stavros's explosive getaway.Presumed-dead-to-the-world and now banished to this shadowy island paradise called The Colony, Quinn recovers but is made a permanent resident of The Colony along with dozens of other agents who are too valuable to kill, too dangerous to let loose (or something similar). The Colony is actually a think-tank of former counter-terrorism experts, who offer their clandestine services to elite clientèle all over the world. Of course, no prison can hold Quinn, who meticulously engineers his escape in one brilliant sequence (the best one in the entire film, in fact), teams up with flamboyant arms-dealer Yaz (Color-me-bad former San Antonio Spurs basketball sensation Dennis Rodman) and together the two go after Stavros, who has kidnapped Quinn's pregnant wife and is threatening to kill her once the baby is born and then raise it has his own.Double Team is a ridiculous action-fest the likes of which have yet to successfully transition into mainstream American films. Hark makes sure the action is fast and ridiculous, but it's unfortunate that the rest of the film is not as skillful.The biggest problem is the insane story it's too insane, too insane for its own good, and lacking brain-power. I understand that the film was originally going to be a much better action thriller with a much smarter plot than what we've got here. But that's Hollywood for you.3/10 "},{"Title":"forgot to mention a few things...","Date":"27 February 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I said my piece on this one, but watching it again on cable, I felt the need to append a few comments1 In The Prisoner, they sent Patrick McGoohan to The village, and he spent 17 increasingly mystically influenced episodes trying to escape.

A boring plot combined with mush-mouthed dialogue is all i got for my rental fee. The best parts of the film are Rodman's pointless references to basketball even though it is never actually pointed out that he has anything to do with basketball.

He is even upstaged by a basketball player who is also not very good at acting.  Mickey Rourke is the best thing on offer here as the bad guy.As usual with Asian directors, the action is superb, well-staged and pacy, but the script spoils it.  This could have been good had the main two actors been replaced with some better ones (like Mark Dacascos, who is far greater than Van Damme but always ends up doing cheap straight to video movies), and the script been rewritten a little bit so every one isn't saying I thought you'd quit the game or You're back in the game? all the time.6/10.

Martial art films have always been a special interest of mine.  I tend to forgive many plot holes, you can drive a truck through some of the plot holes in this movie, if the action is fast and furious.  I could only recommend this film to action buffs or Van Damme fans.  Hong Kong directors have been very influential in the past decade.  John Woo has been a favorite of Tarantino and made the incredible film <I>Face Off</I>. Jackie Chan has made great strides in American popularity.  Now Tsui Hark has made this enigmatic film.  American action directors should take note of Tsui Hark's filming.  He makes most directors seem anemic.  One fight scene is awesome.  It involves a foot with a switchblade.  This film will be known for the teaming of Dennis Rodman (Yaz) and Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Dennis Rodman made a wise choice here.  He chose a supporting role as a weapon's supplying deviant.  His acting ability is shaky and he spits out horrible basketball puns at the most inappropriate times.  Nevertheless, it is smart to choose a small role when you are a beginner.  This is in contrast to Shaquile O'Neal's putting himself in the main roles of bad films when he should have done more support acting.  Now Van Damme's ability to act is the same as it ever was -- mediocre as long as he stays away from emotion.Now I wonder, what happened to Mickey Rourke?  Apparently he has been boxing and is the antagonist in this film.  After a promising career in the 80's, he has disappeared in the 90's.  Rourke plays as Stavros, an independent mercenary who is currently after Van Damme.  Van Damme is partially responsible for the death of Stavros's son and wife at a blown sting operation at an amusement park.  Later, Stavros blows up Van Damme, but does not kill him.  Van Damme wakes up in a colony of former agents who now help protect the world.  He cannot leave and the world thinks he is dead.  Stavros later takes Van Damme's wife (who is pregnant) for revenge.This film plays more like anime than it does anything else.  There are logic holes everywhere, but there are interesting characters and plot turns.  There are cybermunks -- priests who live underground connected to the Internet, plenty of action, life-saving coke machines, and lots and lots of unnecessary violence (though not too gory).  In fact, I am a bit surprised that it is rated R.  I could almost recommend this film, if it was not for the ubiquitous logical mistakes.  It made me wish that I could have had a hand in the script and blot out several things.  One scene had Yaz move a cross over a land mine and place it at a different position.  Now guess who stepped on the false mine and who stepped where the cross was relocated.  In addition, a tiger knew where all the land mines were planted.  Why was there a tiger there?  Do not ask.

And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team.My day job includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through.I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many.So what was so awful about Double Team? Well, first of all the name Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone &#x96; not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker &#x96; wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds.The next thing&#x85; well&#x85; Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't.Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie.Double Team even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in what was so awful about&#x85; is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to Double Team, he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). Double Team flushed down in 1997 and then&#x85; that was it. I think everything after Double Team was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box office&#x85; until Double Team. Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that.

Van Damme needs help and so he enlist the help of Dennis Rodman(what did the Chicago Bulls cut him from the roster) who is a gun dealer. Well that is all the plot you really need, I mean what i just described could be action gold, not really i mean there is a lot of plot holes and a lot of scenes that just don't make sense. And now i come to the great director Tsui Hark ( i know if you just seen this film and his other movie starting Van Damme Knock Off you could be asking yourself great director my ---) the director who gave us Once upon a time in china 1,2,3,4,5 and Pecking Opera Blues and other great hong kong movies. But this movie is not even in the same area code to these great movies but he does direct the film for all he's worth and does keep the movie flowing at a great pace and does give us a lot of action and Tsui at least make Van Damme look good as he enlist the great Sammo Hung to do the fights(lets be clear that the stuntman does most of the action for Van Damme) and Tsui Hark even got the great Peter Pau to shoot the film. Yes Peter Pau who went on to win a Oscar a couple years later for shooting Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In the end all i could say is that you could find worse movies starting Van Damme (there is too many to count) and you could find better like Hard Target,Timecop,or maybe Sudden Death. Double Team get a C+. So there Thank You. "},{"Title":"Van Damme the ULTIMATE 80's / B-movie actor","Date":"12 April 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" Now we're talking!

I also learned that Dennis Rodman defied the odds and can now claim the title of World's Worst Actor away from Van Damme himself. Oh and do not, I repeat DO NOT attempt to fight Van Damme by kicking your shoes off at him or by kicking at him with a knife between your toes. It will only make the beating you receive worse....trust me on that one. Probably the most useful thing of all that I learned is that if you come across a tiger the best thing you can do is throw a sidekick at it!

In addition, if you're not able to take an Van Damme underrated, bashed, hated solid action film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Double Team (1997) alongside with Knock Off (1998) is very underrated, bashed and hated movie, mostly for Van Damme performance. This film has received a lot of negative reviews and was a box office fail. I understand why people does not like this movie, I understand and I like it! It is not one of my top 10 favorite Van Damme movies, but I like it, even more than Knock Off. I have always enjoyed this film more than Knock Off. Double Team was Van Damme's first time filming with Chinese film director Tsui Hark, because one year later, they both made together Knock Off another underrated action movie. In my opinion beside Van Damme, Mickey Rourke and Dennis Rodman both of the actors did a solid job and performance together playing their characters. There was a lot of explosions, a lot of action scenes, and a lot of martial arts shown from Van Damme and Mickey Rourke. I like the idea, When Jack Quinn (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a former counterterrorist agent fails to catch alive a terrorist leader Stavros (Mickey Rourke) and accidentally one of his Agent's kills Stavros 6.year old son, Jack Quinn is exiled to colony for dead agents on an empty deserted island and their is no escape from this island. Stavros plot's vengeance against Quinn and takes his wife Kathryn (Natacha Lindinger ) as a hostage and her unborn child now Quinn has to escape and team with Jaz (Dennis Rodman) to get his wife back and Stavros once and for all. I love the training sequences and the music score for the movie. I liked the performance from Van Damme and Rodman, I don't think they acted stupid in this movie, they did not! I bagged my aunt to tape me this movie on VHS, when I was a teen and she did. I like this movie a lot, I like the shoot outs. Double Team was also one of my favorite Van Damme movies. Dennis Rodman and Mickey Rourke co started in this movie. About an CIA agent who misses his target and finds him self on an island for a retired agents and he finds out that his target Stavros kidnapped his wife and his unborn baby and he plans to kill them both unless Quinn escapes. Training and action sequences are excellent and Double Team is also Van Damme's action movie that I like. It is an explosive, high-tech ride. Mickey Rourke was a good bad guy. I really had no idea Paul Freeman was in this movie, he was so awesome in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), I really had no idea he was in this movie as Quinn's guardian. I like when Van Damme fight's off the tiger in the coliseum, those scenes with the tiger where fantastic. I liked that Rodman helped Quinn saving his baby, when the baby case was standing on a mine filed and Rodman saved him. The fights between Mickey Rourke and Van Damme weren't that good, but they were not that bad either. Van Damme and Mickey Rourke both differently worked in The Expendables movies. Rourke in The Expendables and Van Damme in The Expendables 2. Double Team is a 1997 action film that marked the first American movie directed by Hong Kong director Tsui Hark (A Better Tomorrow III). The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Jack Quinn, a former counterterrorist agent who is exiled to a penal colony for disgraced operatives. Upon his escape, Quinn teams with an arms dealer to track down the terrorist who ruined his life. The film co-stars Dennis Rodman, Paul Freeman, and Mickey Rourke. Director Hark would later collaborate with Van Damme in 1998's Knock Off. This movie get's 6 by me, I wish I would have this movie on Blu-ray, I am probably the only one that just likes this movie. Much better than Knock Off! The training sequences from Van Damme where really kick ass and the action stunts from Van Damme where solid, so they weren't bad.

The idea of Dennis Rodman first of all as an action hero is bad enough but the fact that he makes Jean-Claude Van Damme seem like an Oscar contender is something that is quite surprising. Mickey Rourke has his moments as the villain and there are some visually appealing moments but that doesn't stop this from being the utmost worst from Jean-Claude's filmography.1/2* out of 4-(Awful) "},{"Title":"Not that good","Date":"16 May 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" You start realizing that the Muscles from Bruxelles's career has gone down the drain when the other actors in this movie are Dennis Rodman and a Mickey Rourke way beyond his prime time.

I don't think they knew what they were doing when they made the script. For example, in one scene, van Damme meets a guy that he has met before. It looked like they were some kind of enemies. But that's it. We don't see this guy anymore in the movie. What was the point in this, scriptwriters? The last scene is especially bad, with a fighting scene inside some kind of ancient arena.

Double Team might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of Sin City). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes.Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don (Lifeforce) Jakoby and Paul (The Quest) Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on Hard Target,but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct Broken Arrow and Face/Off with Nicolas Cage. In Maximum Risk, Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both Hard Target and Maximum Risk, Double Team takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream.Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal.The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about Double Team is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good.If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, Double Team ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of Double Team.

However, trouble rears its head in the form of super-evil baddie Stavros (Rourke), a longtime enemy of Quinn's. Stavros is so dangerous, Quinn must travel to Antwerp to meet Yaz (Rodman), a colorful, flamboyant arms dealer, to sell him the latest in hi-tech weaponry. After a shootout and one-on-one battle with Stavros, he ends up escaping once again, and Quinn is sent to a mysterious place called The Colony which is not at all based on The Prisoner TV show. Quinn spends most of his time at The Colony training and working on his escape plan. Once firmly out of the grasp of The Colony, he and Yaz team up to take one last shot at Stavros - who has kidnapped Katherine, and now his newborn son. Will Quinn and Yaz make the ultimate DOUBLE TEAM? Double Team is classic 90's Van Damme. The presence of Dennis Rodman cements the fact that it's classic 90's, period. This was not only an era in time when JCVD movies came to the theater, but when DENNIS RODMAN movies came to the theater. It truly was a more innocent time for us all. The fact is, Rodman's outlandish female outfits, wacky hair, silly one-liners and, let's face it, infectious charisma enliven the movie immeasurably. Director Tsui Hark brings that kinetic HK style and crazy camera angles he and his brethren are known for. Throw in some Mickey Rourke as the baddie and a tiger (during the climactic battle) and you have the enjoyable and entertaining movie we know and love today.During a big chunk of the movie, namely the Prisoner sequence, you might find yourself asking where's Yaz? or this movie could really use more Yaz. The fact is, Rodman and Van Damme do have very good chemistry together, and there's certainly no shortage of basketball jokes and references in the movie. During the heyday of Rodman, he only appeared in two movies. This one and Simon Sez (1999). Fascinatingly, and inexplicably, both films feature Cyber-Monks. That is, underground monks using modern technology. A quick look on Urban Dictionary for Cyber Monk includes this excerpt They have a strange tendency to show up in high-tech espionage movies starring Dennis Rodman. Some are known to dance. Whether they are in Rodman's contract as a prerequisite to him being involved, we don't know, but Cyber Monks are definitely a thing. And we don't know why. Martial Artist and stuntman Xin Xin Xiong is also involved with both Rodman vehicles.Double Team definitely delivers what fans want wild stunts, a classic training sequence (but with a twist Van Damme's time-honored split is done vertically this time, not simply horizontally as usual), at least one character walking away from an explosion in slow motion, and many characters who scream while shooting their machine guns. Because Hark is the director, there are certainly some odd close-ups and such, and there are many moments that are weirdly nonsensical, but it's all part of the fun. Plus the movie mentions North Korea as a threat, which was pretty ahead of its time in 1997.Rodman knows you can never get enough Rodman, which is why he also appears on the closing credits song, Just a Freak by Crystal Waters featuring Dennis Rodman. Maybe that's why his star burned brightly but quickly back in the 90's. But at least we have Double Team as proof that he teamed up with Van Damme back in that heady time. And the results are everything you could ask for.

I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question ''Did you open it?''

The script by Don Jakoby & Paul Mones is absolutely terrible, to be blunt it's totally embarrassing. Double Team is one of the most stupid & lamest big budget action flicks I've ever seen. It's meant to be some sort of action comedy that just fails on every level, technically & conceptually. Where do I start?

Even the title Double Team is basketball term & don't get me started on that basketball shaped parachute which is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in a film. Then there's the action scenes which are just as dumb, I mean Van Damme physically holding onto a net which is being towed behind a plane while it is flying? What about the hilarious climax at the Colosseum? Van Damme has to fight a tiger in a mine infested area, OK so Van Damme won't trigger the mines but what about the the tiger? Has that been trained not to set them off also? Then there's the fact that when the mines do explode it destroys the ENTIRE building yet Van Damme, Rodman, Paul Freeman & Van Damme's son can stand behind an ordinary Coca Cola vending machine which shield's them from the intense flames to an extent where they aren't even singed & the vending machine isn't destroyed? What about the scene in which Stavros warns Van Damme about the car he has wired & not to drive it? Eh? If he wanted Van Damme dead why warn him not to drive the car? The best, most discreet way to find your kidnapped wife while everyone is looking for you is to take along a 7 foot tall black guy with green hair & nose, ear & tongue piercing, isn't it? European monks are computer literate & accept gifts from arms dealers, aren't they? What about the opening sequence which is never mentioned again & seems only half complete? Damned I could go on all day about how stupid & moronic this film is, I really could. The only positive is that it's not dull & there's plenty of things going on.Director Tsui does a terrible job, there's so much slow motion & the action scenes are just stupid. Like the guy who fights with a knife between his toes, I mean why didn't he just hold the knife in his hands? The work out scenes with Van Damme as he bench presses a bath of water, these montage scenes would look embarrassing in a Rocky flick! There's a bit when Van Damme trips on some coke cans (lots of product placement in this) & as he flies through the air does some kicks & knocks a couple of bad guys out before he hits the floor! Van Damme also gets to kick a tiger in the head during a so bad it's funny climax! Damned there's just so much wrong with Double Team it's amazing, virtually every scene has something wrong with it. The special effects are crap too, the scenes with Van Damme jumping from explosions contain some really poor blue screen work that Doctor Who would be embarrassed about. Because it's so dumb the action is never convincing & it doesn't excite or draw you in. The violence is mainly just martial arts fighting & people getting shot, it's all rather comical & there's nothing new here.With a supposed budget of $30,000,000 this is the film which basically ended Van Damme's career & sent his subsequent efforts straight-to-video/DVD. Both Van Damme & especially Rodman are pretty awful in this, the basketball jokes & one liners are literally painful to listen too.Double Team is a crap action film that could have been great, it had the budget, it had a decent cast on paper & a good director but it turned out to be a disaster.

MILD SPOILERS !!!!!The major problem with DOUBLE TEAM is that the plot is so slippery it`s impossible to explain . It involves the hero Jack Quinn hunting arch-terrorist Stavros and because Quinn fails in his mission which leaves several people dead he`s given the choice of instant death or being exiled to an island similar to the one in THE PRISONER . He chooses exile but decides to break out to gain revenge on Stavros who`s planning to kill Quinn`s wife and new born child If the last paragraph makes much sense then I`ve probably explained it all wrong because the plot is totally underdeveloped with a massive amount of scenes that lead nowhere . For example Quinn runs into an old rival on the island and gets involved in a fight . Who the rival is remains vague and we never see him again . It`s as though the screenwriter got bored with the subplot and discarded it while he was writing it and the film is littered with these subplots that are unexplained and go nowhere . I was also going to mention the climax with the tiger and the sports staduim that`s been mined but you`d never believe it   "},{"Title":"Action thriller!","Date":"22 October 2000","Score":"4 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Jean-Claude Van Damme is great in this film. He unites with Rodman to fight terrorists. Has plenty of action and some jokes. Lots of scenes with pretty backgrounds. The acting was good and could have been better. Worth watching.  "}]
