[{"Title":"Dude, you need to calm down...","Date":"5 February 2004","Score":"93 out of 114 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  After reading this last guy's review, I'd like to stick up for this movie and offer a BALANCED review. In my opinion, Dante's Peak does a good job of developing the characters (Dalton, R. Wando, the volcano as a character, even the townsfolk), giving convincing backstory as to how volcanos behave compared to scientists' expectations, making us care about the characters, building tension through conflict between Dreyfus and Dalton, and using effects to ramp up the intensity of the action scenes.Yes, there were things in the script and the story which seemed a little contrived and strained believability. The attitudes and behavior of the USGS team were a little too informal and hip to seem real. The driving-through-the-river and driving-through-the-lava scenes were really too far out to be believed. Ruth's selfishness and patent stubbornness were unbelievable but understandable. The scene where the pyroclastic cloud chases them into the mine is pure hollywood fluff but still livable, mainly because WE CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. I found the character of Dr. Paul Dreyfuss to be right on. He explained the dilemma well during the city council meeting scene. All of the characters are believable at least, convincing at most.I think the chemistry between Dalton and Wando is believable  Here you have a scientist who is analytical and professional, but who is still in touch with the lives of laypeople, and has a tender side. He has loved and lost before and he senses that this new volcanic threat is akin to the last one which took his love away. This re-enforces the precept that THIS TIME, HE WON'T LET THE VOLCANO HURT THE ONES HE LOVES. Wando is the warm, slightly ditsy mayor of Dante's Peak who displays the identifiable traits and values of a northwesterner. She feels slightly overwhelmed by her mayoral duties, raising her kids properly, and running her coffeeshop. She's had a previous marriage to a deadbeat who left her at a vulnerable point. The arrival of Dalton is very catalytic in her life. She's met the only man who has the right answer about the volcano, likes her kids, likes her, is intriguing, and is everything her ex wasn't. THIS IS THE MAKINGS OF A ROMANCE...DUH.I'm really impressed that the filmmakers were able to pack this much character development, backstory, romance, suspense, personal conflict, with an intense end-sequence in under 1 1/2 hours! Volcano is a film with a similar premise that,IMHO, doesn't even come close to Dante's Peak. While this film is not deserving of an Oscar, IT IS A SOLID FILM, HAVING BEEN WELL-CONCEIVED, WELL-DIRECTED, FAIRLY WELL-ACTED, AND AS SUCH IS SUBSEQUENTLY WELL-DESERVING OF SOME CRITICAL ACCLAIM rather than getting a baseless pummeling from reviewers who obviously expect to see a 5-star gem everytime they go to the movies.

I have to say of its day because technology has made CGI become dated quickly these days. This film is all about a volcano, a la Mt. St. Helen's, erupting and killing people and destroying a small town below it. Some of the scenes were just jaw- dropping and, at least for the first-time viewer, a lot of suspense over whether the main characters of the story will survive it.Of course, there are some credibility gaps in here, things that just could not happen such as little boy drive van up a mountain (when his feet wouldn't reach the foot pedals!) but you just go along for the ride and enjoy the tension and special effects even if the story gets a little hokey.It might not be the most intelligent film, but it's very entertaining 109 minutes, and that's the name of the business. It's good escapist fare, and that's all. It's worth two looks.

After the success of Twister and ID4, films like Hard Rain, Titanic, Armageddon and Deep Impact followed in its wake. Like the two competing asteroid movies, Dante's Peak was in competition with the imaginatively named Volcano as THE Lava flow of 1997. Which one is better? Well, comparing the two is like comparing an atomic blast to a popping pimple.Pierce Brosnan is Harry Dalton, a Vulcanologist (or James Bond in disguise if you want) who predicts a major eruption in the quaint Pacific-Northwestern town of Dante's Peak. No one wants to listen to him since the town has just been named the 2nd most desirable place to live in America and is in the early stages of a thriving economy. It's the politics from Jaws all over again. Despite being shouted down by his superiors, Harry sticks around to keep his eye on the imposing mountain and woo Mayor Wando (Linda Hamilton), who is the only one who believes the 4000-year dormant volcano might blow its top.If you've seen one disaster movie, you've seen 'em all in terms of character importance. Yes, it's bloody obvious who is going to die, some of these people might as well have a death clock counting down stuck on their foreheads. And the panicking idiot mobs don't deserve anything less firey. When will nameless extras learn that following the crowd isn't the best way? I guess this is the weakest part of Dante's Peak, it never really distances itself from that single, eternal clich√© of disaster films.But the film is really nothing but a showcase for special effects and it does them surprisingly well. Made before the extreme popularity of CGI, Dante's Peak has a lot of real-life destruction, in-camera effects and stunt-work. Yes, there is a fair bit of CGI and for a 10-year-old film they still hold up really well. All Volano (Zzzz...) had to offer was a very, very slight lava flow and an unintentionally hilarious scene with a melting man but with Dante's Peak we get earthquakes, boiled skinny dippers, lakes of acid, ash blizzards that create a unique atmosphere, thunder and lightning, red hot boulders raining down from the sky, mudslides, lava (of course), a massive pyroclastic cloud and lots of deep, deep bass sound effects.It's not a life-changing film by any means, but as disaster movies go it's one of the best, has an occasionally spooky score and entertains really well despite Brosnan taking it all so seriously. I would have given it a higher rating if they killed the dog (more original) and deleted the annoying Grant Heslov's utterly pointless character.

I saw it again and thought it not very good at all and now having seen it recently, I not bad, but not great either. It's a well done disaster movie with one challenge after another to survive being thrown at the main characters. This roller coaster ride really pulled me in and even reminded me of the very well done remake of The Fugitive, starring Harrison Ford. I'll admit some of the situations are a little hard to believe, but at least they keep the film from being boring.The chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton, while not incredible, is still there. Also enjoyable was how the film makes use of its small town setting, including in the casting characters you'd expect to find in a small town the female gossip, the gruff, but dedicated sheriff, and the more business-minded don't-rock-the-boat councilman. Finally, Harry (Brosnan) and Paul Dreyfus's band of colleagues also prevent the movie from being flat, but are a little too reminiscent of the characters from Twister to really leave their own mark.Also what impressed me was some of the camera work, which I think isn't given enough credit. There are a number of composite shots of the erupting volcano with the reflection (probably understood to be from a truck's window) of Rachel (Hamilton) looking back in horror that are quite well done. And the digital editing in of the volcano is also well done as well as some of the panoramas.A smaller problem I had with the movie is the development of Harry and Rachel's relationship. Initially their flirtations and the initial getting to know each other are quite cute. But I can't help but think why Rachel, who has been a small-town girl her whole life would be interested in someone like Harry who clearly states a that his job isn't exactly conducive to settling down. Sure Harry is everything her ex-husband isn't and it's obvious that the both of them are lonely to a degree, but it doesn't seem to me that a woman as sensible and who feels as great a responsibility as Rachel (to her kids, to the town, to her business) would find that to be enough. Also, Harry seems to get over the touchy subject of his dear departed Marianne to start making passes at Rachel in her kitchen quite quickly.My biggest problem with the movie is the writing, which is so bad in some places that it really brings down the parts in the movie where it is good. Harry's line about sex being like riding a bicycle because once you learn you never forget is laughable. Some of the Wando children's lines I found to be lacking in substance too and almost condescending to the viewer. But, as I said, not all the writing is bad an example is the excellent delivery of a reference to Pompei by one of Harry and Paul's colleagues and another's excitement over Rachel's regular coffee deliveries.In the end, when this movie is bad, it's bad, but in general it's good.

Of course, for me to watch more than once they need at least the following decent acting, story, heart and definitely good special effects to make me believe not only that I am there, but that there's an imminent threat presented. Dante's Peak really fits the bill. Perfect? By all means, no, and I don't think Brosnan, Hamilton or Director Donaldson would disagree. They all set out to show a film of heart, with a backdrop of a natural disaster, in this case, an erupting volcano. Sure, it's not original; Dante's Peak solely takes from Twister and even Jaws. And it seems like, similar to Jurassic Park, they had the technology, why not create a definite volcano disaster flick. Giving the Brosnan volcanologist a bit of a background, he loses his girl in a separate volcano incident four years prior. And now he may be jumping the gun in the quiet, 2nd best town of Dante's Peak by saying their sleepy volcano's about to blow. Obviously, the story (and events that follow) is predictable, but that's the fun in going into a film like this. The first half of the film is filmed with gorgeous mountain scenes and a great looking town. The second half is what people bought tickets (or rented) for a roller coaster of action, suspense and touching moments, though mostly forced. Hamilton and Brosnan save the movie with their believable, though clich√©d and predictable characters. And some scenes, you'll just have to suspend that disbelief seriously, not only is he going to attempt to drive over lava, but put everyone else and the leaping dog at risk?

I read reviews where people criticized it because the cast contained too many unknown actors. That is the biggest line of B.S. I've ever heard. You've got Pierce Brosnan who two years prior had played James Bond in Golden Eye (his best James Bond in my opinion), and Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor). At the time these were two A list actors. Then I read people mentioning the acting was poor. It's a disaster movie! The acting was absolutely fine and even the children were strong in my opinion. The only negative I could see, which is present in almost every adventure/thriller/disaster/horror movie is when no one listens to warning or concern from the main character. But that's what makes these films. Just putting myself in the situation, I can imagine the frustration Pierce faced when he clearly sensed danger but no one took his word. However this is required to create suspense and allows a build up to the films climax. What I appreciated about the plot is how the grandmother essentially caused all the issues that led to putting the family in harms way then she sacrificed herself to save the lives of the others. I gave Dante's Peak a 7/10 as a general review. If I was rating strictly based on disaster movies I would rate this at an 8.5/10. Definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it yet.

Earthquake movies, movies about made-up natural disasters that cannot happen, asteroid movies, even some nuclear holocaust films (like The Day After, unique in how many survive). It's a hackneyed formula, but it also works, and nothing else really does work as well for disaster plots. It was followed here.The special effects were terrific in the day, and they still hold up very very well in 2012.For a Hollywood film, the science was pretty good. I actually cringed back at the shots of Hawaii type basalt floes (just...no), and the ashfall cleared up nicely whenever they wanted a wide shot, which anyone in Yakima could tell you it really doesn't do, and the boat and drive-over-lava scenes were silly, and if you paddle a boat (through acid or not) with one hand, it's not going to go straight, and our heroes didn't need to cover their mouths in ashfall (meaning, IRL, the ash would turn to concrete in their lungs and they'd suffocate). However, all that having been complained about, much else was very accurate what gets tested for by volcanologists, what monitoring stations of the day looked like, what some of the warning signs of a coming eruption might be. Most Hollywood film reviews by me on science-based movies are nothing but a list of what they did wrong, with no however of accurate bits to follow that list, so kudos for doing it more than half right.A pleasant diversion, very pretty to look at.

Another good point is that the movie does not include the stereotypical sleazy government or corporate type that ignores the warnings of the disaster.  The objections Brosnan's boss raises to his alarm are reasonable.  Finally, the computer-generated effects are well done. Yet, I can not give the movie a passing grade.  At its heart, it is just a CGI update of a genre that died out in the 1970's.  Also, possibly because of the fictional setting and the complete dependence on CGI, the danger that the town will be destroyed is never compelling.  The viewer wishes that Brosnan and Hamilton (and the dog) are saved, and the movie gives you interesting visuals, but not much more.

Along with other signs, Harry wants to place an alert but his politics-playing boss Dr. Paul Dreyfus overrules him.It seems like a more realistic volcano movie in the first half which may not actually make it a good disaster movie. A disaster movie needs to be fun more than being accurate. There are also some inconsistencies. At one moment, Harry is convinced of impending doom. The next moment, he's setting up a town meeting to discuss an evacuation many hours later. In a disaster movie, he should be pushing for an immediate evacuation while he battles resistance. The last half is more of an action-packed disaster movie. Why the mayor doesn't send her kids to safety right away is beyond me. It becomes a random series of close calls.

The worst is when Harry has the truck drive through the 5000 degree Fahrenheit lava, do not try that or you will find out what I am talking about. It will be the last thing you discover before you are cooked like a chicken in the truck. The star of this movie is the volcano effects. There is competent acting with Brosnan and Hamilton, nothing to write home about. The grandmother will have you yelling at the screen,Gee, honey, the mountain is my friend, we take long afternoons together. Please, where is that hypo? Hamilton plays the mayor of this little town nestled beneath Dante's Peak. I love that geologist's line,Oh, look the town's right under the volcano just like Pompeii. The buildup to the eruption is handled well, the usual nobody believes Harry and the giant butt bureaucrat tells everybody, don't worry. My whole living room was applauding when he gets washed away, I am supposed to feel sorry for this guy? The photography, up on the mountain, is excellent. There really is no comparison to Volcano. Yes, it has Tommy Lee Jones but this has a script, great effects, suspense and is quite exciting.The kids may grate upon you a bit but they are paragons of behavior compared to the two brats in Stevie's War Of The Worlds. The grandmother together with the children is the one, two punch of painfully annoying. Luckily, she walks in the acid lake water, saving everybody, so we are rid of her the last half of the movie. The depiction of the eruption seemed quite geologically accurate, the Lahar, the ash clogging all the cars and machines; this was all well done. You will get to see why you do not take a helicopter out of an ash cloud. The other cringe worthy moment is when they outrun a pyroclastic flow. Please, they move at 130 MPH, you are not outrunning them. This is not as bad as driving over the molten lava but for anyone who had geology, it is silly. There is the requisite romance between Hamilton and Brosnan but it does not take up much screen time. The supporting cast is OK, a little weak in some areas, no Oscars here.This really is the paradox, Volcano cannot hold a candle to this movie in effects, writing or suspense; it has the best actor, Tommy Lee Jones but a little of Anne Heche goes a long way. Volcano is worth watching but this is the one to buy. The volcano effects are so stunning you will hardly notice anything else.

What I mean by that is that the film strictly adheres to the disaster film code, thus making the film extremely predictable. That being said, I couldn't help but enjoy myself for the most part. There is lots of action thanks to an erupting volcano and I actually felt for our main characters despite being somewhat one-dimensional.Roger Donaldson's film starts off when we see a volcanologist named Dr. Harry Dalton who loses his wife thanks to an erupting volcano in Colombia. Four years later, he is sent to a town named Dante's Peak where he is investigating possible volcanic activity with the help of the mayor, Rachel Wando. But as the movie progresses, we find that there is just more than volcanic activity....The actors here give their best shot in playing their characters. I felt for the characters as they faced the wrath of the volcano, but I couldn't buy into the eventual romance between Rachel and Harry. Pierce Brosnan was pretty good as Harry Dalton as the subdued man with a tragic past. Linda Hamilton was decent as Rachel, though she is a long way from her Terminator days.Overall, Dante's Peak is your average disaster film that is very formulaic, but still entertaining. I mean, who can't resist the molten ash and the pyro cloud causing destruction. There are some flat characters, but the action is superb. This is one of the films that brought back the disaster film craze in the late 90's. I couldn't help but like this film. I rate this film 8/10.

It appears to be scientifically accurate about the behavior of a volcano and how unpredictable it can be and the devastation it can cause. The scenery is stunning and the special effects are awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you can believe every characters situation. It has a few weaknesses. A bit unbelievable that the young boy could drive a van up the mountain when his feet couldn't touch the pedals! Also trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow, I think you would be in pieces. Most unbelievable scene was driving the car through lava, very entertaining - lava can reach 2000 degrees, don't think there would have been any signs of the car left. Don't care about that I loved it. I would give the movie 8.5 out of 10. It really gave me an interest in volcano's and how they work. It showed how people might react against such a treat in their town and how the town's council would try and play it down hoping it wouldn't happen.

Not much of a differences now isn't it? DANTE'S PEAK is what it is, a big-budget summer offering, where the money is heavily spent on special effects, and the script is either out of focus or uninteresting. DANTE'S PEAK could fall to the guilty pleasures list along with all those dated 70's disaster movies, but I did like it more than a guilty pleasure. It's still average at best for sure, but it's got some fun moments with its special effects, and that's pretty good enough to recommend.Let's run through the disaster movie checklist shall we? 1.) Is there the scientist who predicts the danger and ends up being neglected at first, but ends up being the ultimate hero in the end? Yes there is, and he's played by Pierce Brosnan. The character's Harry Dalton, a vulcanologist joining his crew studying the extinct volcano at Dante's Peak. Brosnan's a good actor and pulls off the role easily, but the character's not very interesting enough. At the end of the film, you'll end asking Who was he again... Harry who? 2.) Is there the guy who doubts the leads warnings? You betcha! He's Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan), Dalton's boss, who thinks Harry's just nuts! Besides the fact that he does learn his mistake in the end, there's nothing more this character does. 3.) Are there the supporting characters including the leading lady, the annoying kid(s) and of course the dog? Why shouldn't there be? The movie's got two kids, and a dog. There's also the grandmother and experts. Linda Hamilton who gave women the ultimate credibility in TERMINATOR 2 plays a rather feeble character here as Mayor Rachel Wando, mayor and love interest, overall a disposable summer movie character.Oh lets face it! The writing here isn't very good, but it's still a lot of fun nonetheless. Even if we don't care about these cookie-cutter characters, those action scenes (including the one where they're chased by the cascading lava flows) are pretty exciting. It's forgettable summer fare, but it does it's job. Better enjoy it for what it is.Rating *** out of 5.

Basically vulcanologist Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) lost his girlfriend Marianne (Walker Brandt) four years ago during a volcano eruption in Columbia, and he is being called by boss Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan) to investigate another one. The town of Dante's Peak, Washington is located next to a large mountain, that is a dormant volcano, and some unusual activity has been reported that needs looking. So while Harry and his team are investigating he meets and gets to know town mayor and food and drinks' store owner Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) and her children, daughter Lauren (Jamie Ren√©e Smith) and son Graham (Jeremy Foley). Noticeable events around the town that the volcano might be waking up include lake water heating dramatically and killing two people, and some minor earthquakes, but Paul doesn't think the town should be on alert. As soon as Harry presents evidence of the town's water supply containing sulphur this triggers the need to start an evacuation, but when this plan begins that is when the volcano finally erupts. Harry, Rachel and the children are now racing against time to get out of the town and avoid the blasts, the lava flows, the acid turned water, the rushes of water, and from the final blast the powerful Pyroclastic cloud. Also starring Elizabeth Hoffman as Ruth, True Lies' Grant Heslov as Greg, Kirk Trutner as Terry Furlong, Arabella Field as Nancy, Tzi Ma as Stan, Brian Reddy as Les Worrell, Lee Garlington as Dr. Jane Fox and Bill Bolender as Sheriff Turner.

For example it is not possible to drive across an active lava flow, even one that has partly solidified to form a thin crust. Having a very high temperature lava will quickly melt rubber tyres.Another aspect that is not realistic is when the U.S. Geological Survey used a robot with Spiderlegs to detect sulphur dioxide around the volcano. Robots are not actually used by the USGS to monitor volcanoes, they rely on observations and measurements made by experienced scientists and on critical data sent by radio or satellite.The features of the eruption I thought were fairly realistic. The eruption featured a black ash cloud and gas above the volcano. The volcano was gushing out pyroclastic bombs. The ash mixed with melting snow and ice causing a mud flow. the volcano caused an earthquake and a seismometer was used to detect it.

The robot proved faulty so Terry went down to kick it when suddenly an earthquake caused a bunch of rocks to fall, destroying the robot and nearly killing Terry. Harry tried once again to convince Paul to evacuate the town. He refused and Nancy, Greg and Stan refused to take Harry's side. That evening, Harry discovered sulfur dioxide in the town's water supply. That finally convinced Paul. They called a town meeting where Rachel told everybody to evacuate. They tried calling Ruth and told her to get out of the mountain area. She refused so while Harry and Rachel were gone, Graham and Lauren actually drove Rachel's truck to go get Grandma.

Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton, two action/adventure stars, do little to expand their acting abilities.  The rest of the cast doesn't give us much more than panicked looks, with the exception of Brosnan's boss, who does give a somewhat believable reasons to not take news of an impending volcano burst seriously.  The kids aren't impressive and the manipulative script wants us to worry about their fate.  The grandmother (Elizabeth Hoffman, mother of the Sisters TV clan) and her dog live up on a lake near the mountain, and it is her refusal to leave her home which causes the kids and the adult leads to stay behind while the rest of the town is escaping, most to no avail.There are genuine moments of suspense, such as watching the force of the massive earthquake which hits the town while the volcano in the background is showing off its smokey exterior.  Then, we get a massive volcano cloud which chases the two adults and the kids into a mine, supposedly part of the mountain range connected to Dante's Peak.  There is also an impressive raging river scene where Brosnan's crew attempt to escape.  One of the victims gives such a convincing look of knowing his fate that it is even more horrific than watching them go through it.  Seeing this film sadly made me think of those victims of 9/11 and the horror they faced, so at least the film had one memorable impact on me.  However, if Hollywood ever dares to make a 9/11 survival story, I hope we don't get the type of disaster epic they do here.  No forced romances, no over emotional kids to force the tears out, but just real people dealing with a horrific situation.  Had Dante's Peak not tried for 30's style pathos, it could have worked; Survival by itself is a gripping story that you don't need to add those cliches. The same year of Dante's Peak, we also got Volcano, which gave me unintentional chuckles in the theatre I saw it at (the Beverly Center) because that same shopping center was demolished in it, as were several local buildings I see almost every day.  While both films were silly in many ways, I enjoyed Dante's Peak more for its colorful country photography.  Hollywood has not had a great time doing volcano movies; The Last Days of Pompeii (1935) is a small budgeted epic which is fun because of the cliches of the time it was made; Krakatowa, East of Java (1969) is even sillier because it was obviously filmed backwards (according to Leonard Maltin, Krakatowa is actually WEST of Java!).  The all-time worst is When Time Ran Out (1980), Irwin Allen's final disaster epic in which the cast was as boring as the subplots they had to deal with, and even the volcano explosions were unmemorable.  My favorite volcano movie by far has to be The Devil at 6 O'Clock (1961)  with Spencer Tracy and Frank Sinatra.  While I haven't seen it in some time, I recall it with fondness, at least compared to the five other movies I have mentioned.  At least Dante's Peak has some laughs for the ridiculous twists which come throughout.  If you can look at it with tongue-in-cheek and not take it too seriously beyond the I'm-determined-to-survive plot, you may have a good time.  While I'm sure some folks did cry at the overly use of cymbols in the finale, I found myself crying, too---that is from too much unintentional laughter!

I watched this movie in my year 10 Geography class. Before watching this movie in, I had watched this movie more than twice with my family. It was a long time ago so I cannot remember. Now on to the review. This is a personally one of my favourite movie. I thought Pierce Brosnan (Mamma Mia) and Linda Hamilton (Terminator) were brilliant!! At the start of the movie I thought it was sad. It is where Pierce's character's (Harry Dalton) girlfriend got hit by a pyroclast that had pierced through the car, and had died. I quite liked the part of the plot were Linda's character (Rachel Wando), who was the mayor and a coffee shop owner, came around to the motel where Harry and his team where staying, to give them coffee and Greg (Grant Heslov) came bounding out yelling ,Coffee, Coffee, Coffee, Cappuccino! I laughed so hard at that part. That saddest part of the movie was were Granny Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman) died, trying to save Rachel, Harry and the kids from a lake that had turned into a giant pool of acid. They were travelling across the lake when the acid starts to eat the boat and it starts to sink, so Ruth jumps into the lake and pulls the boat to the side of the lake. The part of the movie where I thought it was unrealistic when they drove over the lave and the wheels of the truck ,they stole, burst into flames but I think the extreme heat from the lava would at least exploded the gas tank of the car resulting in the explosion of the car. I think the real star of the movie was the volcano because I caused the most mayhem. All together I really like this movie. I would watch this move about ten more times before I got sick of it. The rating for this movie would be 9 out of 10.

It made a volcano look as realistic as harry is trying to find about the volcanoes and see if there is going to be another volcano at Dant√©s Peek.The characters where very good as Harry Grnesone as Piers Brosnon as he played it very well and it look very dramatic. Four years ago Harry was in Peru and he lost his wife by a phyroclast. He worked with Paul who was his boss and all of his crew including Barry and three others. Harry ends up going to Dant√©s peek to check the volcano levels. Harry tested the waters and they where proved to be acidic. Harry then seen two squirrels lying dead as the sulpher dioxide was killing them and the trees too as the birds were flying away. A man and women then got into the hot tub and they then boiled to death. Meanwhile Rachel was collecting was collecting an award for her town. Harry wanted the town to be alerted but Paul refused as the town could go bankrupt. Harry found out that the water had been contaminated and then went to the town's water supply to see it was discolored and poisoned. The volcano then erupted and the entire town became crazy. Harry and Rachel and the children rammed into the underground mine and got trapped but Harry got the Gadget ELF by NASA and sent a signal to his other workers and they found them and they got freed and took them home and kept them safe.I think this movie was very good because of the amount of gore in the movie and because it was very dramatic with so many cliff hangers. I think my favourite part of the movie was when they all got freed. I would recommend everyone to watch this move. Thank You!!

The movie takes an unexpected turn at the start, when the main character (Harry) and his girlfriend who are volcanologists, explore and try to escape a small village that has been overrun by the eruption of a volcano. Unfortunately the girlfriend gets hit by a pyroclast and dies. Set 4 years later, the movie focuses on Harry, who has been sent to a town called Dante's Peak by his boss Paul, and fellow co-workers of the U.S.G.S to test out the activity of a volcano (which is based on Mt St. Helens), but when he gets to the town, he realises fast that the volcano is still active and could erupt at any moment. He makes friends with the mayor of the town, Rachel, and her kids who are also concerned about the volcanic activity and help Harry quickly try to warn the residents of the town of this discovery and save themselves in the process. In my opinion, I thought the movie was fine though it could've been more scary and realistic. I liked the hints to a possible relationship between Harry and Rachel and the things they have in common such as losing a love interest. My favourite scene was when they saved their pet dog and got trapped in the mines and tried to find their way out. I thought the scene was full of suspense. I was quite angered by the fact that Paul would not let the U.S.G.S alert the town sooner as it could've prevented some deaths and injuries and more time for the residents to get out/be prepared. It was sad when the grandmother, Ruth died but then again it could've been such an avoidable death in my eyes. Overall, I found the movie enjoyable to watch.

I really enjoyed this film, some parts were unrealistic and other parts were unrealistic. The main characters were- Pierce Brosnan as Harry and Linda Hamilton as Rachael. Harry worked as a vulcanologist and Rachael was the Mayor of the town and she owned a coffee shop. Rachael had two children called Graeme and Lauren. Four years earlier, Harry's girlfriend was killed by a pyroclast from an active volcano. Paul, who worked for the U.S.G.S. was Harry's boss and he sent him to Dante's peak as there was live activity. Harry found several signs such as squirrels and trees dying. They also found two dead bodies in boiling springs. He tested the water and it was acidic. Harry wanted the whole town alerted. The water supply for the town was contaminated and it had turned an orangy colour. A town meeting was called and during it &#x85; the volcano erupted. It was complete mayhem! They went to the kids' granny's cabin but the lava had destroyed it. Luckily granny had got out in time and so had the dog. There was a lake which they had to cross in a boat but the motor broke and they had to paddle across. The water was extremely acidic and very dangerous. I don't think this was realistic because it wouldn't contaminate as quickly as that. Granny jumped into the contaminated water to push the boat the rest of the way in order to save everyone. The bottom half of granny's body disintegrated and unfortunately she died. Harry and the others stole a truck and they drove over lava. I think this part was very unrealistic because the tyres would probably have melted. E.L.F. was in the back of the truck, which is a tracking device that can send signals to N.A.S.A. They then rammed the truck into a mine. The roof of the mine collapsed in but they all got out safely, even the dog Ruffy. I think the geography side of the film is quite realistic, especially the eruption with the pyroclast falling and the debris, ash and rock. They measured how much activity was happening with a seismometer which is what they use in real life. Overall I thought this movie was great and I would recommend it.

The worst parts to the movie, i think were when Harry's elbow broke and the bone was sticking out and when the two people in the hot springs got acidified from the sulphur dioxide that got into the water. I didn't like these parts as i thought they were too gruesome, and too disgusting. From a geographical point of view, i thought that most of the parts of the movie were unrealistic, for example when the granny jumped out of the boat and disintegrated, i thought that was unrealistic because the lake would not have acidified in the space of a couple of hours.

He receives a call from his boss, Paul Dryfus (Charles Hallahan) to check on unusual activity of a dormant volcano in the Cascades called Dante's Peak. While the town of the same name is celebrating their accomplishment to be number 2 on the most wanted place to live in the country, he meets Rachael Wando (Linda Hamilton), the town mayor and owner of a food and drinks' store. While Harry is checking on Dante's Peak he notices trees, animals and even people had died recently near the volcano, and he wants to put the city council on alert, but people are putting economical interests first and security second. Even Dryfus would not listen to Harry, invoking lack of real scientific evidence while actually being afraid of causing huge financial losses for the investors, and countermands Harry's alert. For a week, the volcano was not overly active, but then the activity began to increase. Just as the city council was put on alert, Dante's Peak erupts. Harry and Rachael must traverse through ash that falls like rain, lava, acid lakes and a pyroclastic cloud to escape from the volcano, and save Rachael's mother and her two children.

Both educational and exciting, this movie ticks all the boxes! For geography or science enthusiasts, you'll find Dante's Peak almost 100% accurate, give or take a few scenes. From PH tests to Sulphur Dioxide &#x96; this movie's informative, yet appealing to the naive eye. Although, I'm not sure a truck could survive driving through lava&#x85;. Not only does this movie feature amazingly talented actors and actresses but also a perfectly portrayed plot! Pierce Brosman stars as the lead role, Harry, a vulcanologist who becomes romantically involved with Rachel, the mayer and coffee shop owner, played by Linda Hamiliton who's famous for her appearance in the Terminator movies. Not everything's fun and games though! With a pyroclast killing Harry's previous girlfriend and now a supposedly dormant volcano threatening to wipe out an entire area of people! I'm definitely not a big fan of gore but even I agree they could have had more. What there was plenty of though, was explosive scenes that could easily have you cowering behind a pillow. My favourite moment was when the grandmother, known as Ruth sacrificed herself by sliding into acidic waters. Even though the scene was not truly accurate, it still reduced me to tears.

He has a cast of actors who probably wish that their schedules were more occupied when the script came to their attention. Brosnan is the hero whom nobody listens to because everybody seems to know so bloody much. Hamilton reduced to cardboard as the Mayor. Perhaps the script called for a female so she showed up fitting the bill. The rest of the cast is given little to do except watch their careers become a bigger disaster than the one in the film. Filled with clich√©s including the lame apology by those who didn't listen. Technically well made but not a desirable place to live or watch for that matter.

And while this film was released in 1997, at pretty much the exact same time Volcano was getting booted out as well. Out of the two though, this is by far the better movie, largely because it's a much more believable situation with believable characters and scenarios (for the most part, but I'll get to the jarring one's later).So what's the cabbage? Harry Dolton is a Volcanologist working for the US Geological Survey, and is sent to the small town of Dante's Peak in the Cascade Mountains after reports of strange anomalies regarding its local namesake mountain. Upon arrival, he meets with the town's Mayor and moonlighting coffee shop owner Rachel Wando. Although Harry is convinced that the dormant volcano is starting to reawaken, no one else believes him, and he has to try and convince the town and his superiors at the USGS that this mountain is big, bad and ready to blow!Now, the bad parts? This film really is too predictable for words. You know the mountain is going to blow at some point, and you know that the peaceful little town they try to show off as being all beautiful and lovely in the beginning is going to be wiped out. You know Pierce Brosnan is right and everyone else is wrong.Also there are a few very silly scenes that will make you scratch your head in confusion. Firstly, why did the three choose to drive their boat right across the middle of the acid lake rather than sticking to the shore? Why didn't Dreyfus get out of his car on the bridge rather than attempting the impossible? And, most obviously, you can't drive a pickup truck across molten lava and expect to come out okay! Nor can a pickup truck outrun a Pyroclastic Cloud travelling at 200mph! As someone who graduated in Geography, I may have a bit of an advantage, but I'm sure anyone will know that these things really don't happen! Also as a Geography student I was quick to point out the numerous flaws in the geographical accuracy of this eruption, but I won't bore you to death with that!As well as that, there's a few scenes which are simply played for action's sake. One example being in the wood cabin and the Lava bursts through the wall at our heroes. You can't seriously tell me that they didn't notice the fact that things were getting a little hot in there, especially since 1,000 degree lava is literally on the other side of a thin log wall!But there are many good points to this film as well. The story, although predictable, is still quite gripping. The buildup to the volcanic eruption is played quite well and suspenseful, even though you find the other characters stupid for not taking Harry up on his advice even though every single bit of evidence points to him being right!The CGI is also very impressive in places, though perhaps a little choppy in others. The practical effects are good though, especially with the destruction of the town and buildings crumbling. The acting is fairly robust, although many characters have confusing motivations and you wonder why they're thinking what they're thinking, none of the performances are awful per say.Overall, the film is quite gripping though predictable, and even a touch suspenseful in the first half, but doesn't really go down hill in the second half, so much as becomes the standard action movie of running away from the horrible danger with a crescendo of CGI and explosions to top it all off. Not the greatest film ever made and does indeed have many silly moments that do take you out of it somewhat, but it's fairly solid. For a rainy Saturday afternoon movie you can turn your brain off to, this is definitely a contender.

The main character is Harry. His girlfriend is called Rachael who was the town mayor. She has two children called Graham and Lauren. There was a little old granny called Ruth but she sadly died in acid water in a lake. There was also a man called Paul and he was the team leader.There was lots of equipment used in Dante's Peak. Some of them where the E.

One of which was the volcano it was very real looking and so was the giant ash cloud. I personally didn't think that the truck on the lava was very life like because in a real situation you couldn't just drive over it. For example the wheels would burst. I also thought that the pyroclastic cloud was very well done as it looked so real as it came after the characters in the car.The film had loads of emotions the main ones where horror and happiness. Some other emotions through out the whole movie where words like sad, relieved, happy, scared, worried and they might of have felt guilty like when they left Ruth on her own when she died.

I don't believe that any vehicle could drive over lava because it would obviously melt the tyres and burn a hole in the petrol tank and that would explode the whole truck but in the movie there was a scene where the truck drove over the lava and was stationary on the lava for at least ten seconds, I think that is defiantly enough time for the lava to melt the petrol tank and that would result in the whole truck exploding. Overall I think the movie is not that realistic. This movie is good for people around my age in third year because we learn a lot about volcanoes in geography and this movie explains what happens when volcanoes explode, how they explode and the damage and destruction caused by a volcano that erupts. The movie is very enjoyable and is an easy way to teach and learn about volcanoes. In this movie you don't just learn about volcanoes but also all the equipment used to tell whether the volcano is active and likely to explode.

Firstly I am going to introduce you to the characters. There is Harry who is the main man, Rachel-Mayor of Dante's Peak, her mum Ruth and her kids. Then lastly Paul who is the Geology team leader (U.S.G.S). The film starts off with Harry and his girlfriend in a jeep, driving speedily away from an erupting volcano. Sadly a volcanic bomb lands on top of the jeep and hits her on the head. Four years after the tragic event Harry is sent to Dante's Peak to check for an Eruption. This is when Harry first meets Rachel and the kids. When Harry first sees the volcano he is sure it is going to erupt very soon. However his boss Paul doesn't want a big panic over nothing and keeps calm as he thinks there is not going to be an eruption. Harry is right the volcano erupts and destroys the town and rips it to pieces and Harry, Rachel, the kids and Ruth are still very close to the volcano. As they try to save themselves form the volcano they come across a lot of challenges to escape the town of Dante's Peak. My opinion of this film is that it was very interesting to watch and sometimes very addictive form the very start. I would certainly recommend it to anyone that loves action films, as this film is very action packed and full of surprises. I would like to finish off by rating this film a 10/10.

Directed by Roger Donaldson, Dante's Peak is a movie about a volcano set in the Pacific Northwest named, obviously, Dante's Peak that's ready to erupt. United States Geological Survey Vulcanologist Dr. Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) is sent to the area to check out the volcano; only to find that, the volcano will end up erupting sooner than later. With the Mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton), he tries to send the town on alert, only to be shut down by his superior, because the town happens to be second place in the 'most desirable small town to live in the US' list, and they don't want any negative accusations to threaten the town economy. Like Harry predict, the volcano erupts, leaving everybody struggling to survive. Now Harry Dalton and Rachel must journey through ashes and lava to find their kids, and exit the town before it's become too late for them. In my opinion, this movie is a lot better than the similar movie that came out, the same year in Mick Jackson's Volcano. This movie didn't made ash of itself. A lot more realistic and scientifically accurate in tone, that makes this film even more frighten than the fake looking cartoony, Tommy Lee Jones's film. Although the makers of this film, did embellish a little on volcano type logic like having characters able to breath despite Volcanic ash falling on them and outrunning the 700 km/h pyroclastic flow for the sake of the action. You really have to suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie. Others suspension of disbelief scenes, like the driving on hot lava-crossing sequence was really film with stunt men driving over real lava, based on the film commentary. Who knew, that was really possible! Some geologists say they enjoy this movie because they get to see volcanologists in the field and some factual science did go along with the explosions. The film still holds up, as the effects were fantastic at the time. You would think the movie had a lot of CGI, but it's only specifically used for the lava. Majority of the film's visual effects were done either practically, or with very large miniatures, such as the bridge sequence, the dam burst, and even the mountain was a model. The pyroclastic flow was particularly impressive. I love how they use real new footage of the erupting of Mount St. Helens of 1980, and use it for this film. The pacing in the film is great. Dante's had a ton of build up with the threat exposed in the last arc that never really felt like it paid off to me. I didn't like any of the characters from Dante's Peak, besides the Volcanologists crew and Pierce Brosnan. No town folks was worth caring about, not the greedy businessman, or the helicopter pilot as they did a lot of things that would win a Darwin award in stupidity. But the worst had to be Grandma Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman) who does the most stupid things to get the plot going. Mostly, the whole Grandma heroic sacrifice and rescue was kinda was pointless when you think about it. Pierce Brosnan was great as the clich√© main scientist protagonist. Still, it's hard not to think of him as James Bond in this film. He kinda plays it off that way in the action scenes. He's seem less like a scientist, and more like action star. I wish, maybe he could put more drive to separate himself from his James Bond counterpart. Linda Hamilton really get underplay as the person with the most lowbrow level of character development. Honestly, you could put anybody in this role. While, she was in the film, she doesn't stand out as the Mayor. For a mayor, she really doesn't have that much power in the film. She went from being a believable bad ass woman that beat all evil comers in 1991's Terminator 2 to near useless below par character that Pierce Brosnan's character has to save. It's so embarrassing. The children actors are alright. Yes, they can be annoying at times, but I didn't mind them as much as other children character in disaster movies. Overall It's the best Volcano movie that I saw, so far, so I lava this movie! It's an explosive treat, worth the time watching!

The whole movie is the scientist's boss won't believe the scientist clich√© Notable Acting Two big name actors in this movie are Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton. That's right, the 5th James Bond and Sarah Conner. They are actors who if you like them you'll like this movie, but if you don't then you're out of luck as this movie pretty much revolves around them. Everyone else is either a secondary character or a supporting character, this means that they do not get much screen time and/or are ultimately boring/typical filler characters. Annoying child actors as usual and not much else to touch on in that area. Noticeable Camera work Birds tracking shot of getting out of the jeep, nicely done. Establishing shot of the lake and foot of the mountain. Tilting shot to show the sheer scale of Dante's Peak. Worms eye shot for when Terry goes down to fix the robot's leg. Framing of the shot where Harry has just hotwired a green pick up and comes towards the camera and smashed through the gate.Graphics The practical effects of the explosions are realistic an nicely done and they work in good contrast to the CGI lava/pyroclastic clouds Incorrect Science Volcanic activity can turn lakes surrounding the volcano acidic, but it can not melt metal anywhere as quickly as shown in the movie. The PH scale of volcanic tainted water would be around 3 to 5 on the scale. That is vinegar to black coffee, acidic and hot enough to cause damage to skin but not quick damage to metal. And before someone says vinegar doesn't damage skin, its not actual vinegar, it shares the same acidity as vinegar. The boat engine was cooled by a water intake system, seeing as the lake in this movie is PH 0, this would cause the interior of the engine to seize up and melt very quickly. Harry tries to drive a pick up truck over a thin crust of lava and comes out with 4 popped tire and a charred undercarriage, the science of lava shows that it is (1,366¬∫K/1,093¬∫C) this would melt the tires completely as well as melt the undercarriage along with igniting the fuel tank. There is a scene where they try and outrun a pyroclastic cloud in a truck with 4 melted tires. This is like a human trying to outrun a cheetah, it's not going to work. Pyroclastic clouds travel at 450 mph, you would need a Vesco Turbinator (Wheel-driven land speed holder) to outrun it. One correct piece of science is the helicopter scene, where the helicopter crashes because it is flying in the ash filed sky. Helicopters are similar to planes for the fact that they both have air intake systems for the engine, this can easily get clogged up by ash and cause the engine to stop. Overall Feel This is one of the best, and when I say best I mean most accurate volcano movies, the science of the volcano is mostly correct and/or scientifically plausible. It is a classic natural disaster B-list movie, with good effects accompanied by decent acting and storytelling in it. So fun movie regardless and is better than Volcano, hands down. With the main point being that Dante's Peak is much better at pacing its movie and teasing the villain (Volcano) until the end of the movie for an enjoyable climax.

Great chemistry between Brosnan and Hamilton 2. Great Special FX without a minimum of CGI 3. Tight storyline 4. Realistic portrayal of a volcanic eruption 5. nice narrative tone Most people will disagree with me regarding the movie's plausibility, so let me elaborate on this quick 1. You can't outrun a pyroclastic flow Yes you can. Some move with almost sonic speed, but some are much, much slower. having said that, the real point is that they don't outrun the flow at all, they just happen to be close enough to the mine to get there before the flow does. 2. There wouldn't be red hot viscous lava I agree, and i wish they would have stuck to the facts here. I guess they figured people would feel tricked to see a volcano movie without that kind of stuff so they felt urged to put it in. Also, the lava was used as a plot device, but they surely would have found something else that would have done the trick just as well. 3. You can't drive across lava I'd say it is possible, it just depends on its temperature and thus on viscosity. Since they are first attacked by quite thin lava, i'd say the movie is simply inconsistent in this regard. They could have made the first lava less fluid as well. However, i don't think the attempt to cross this lava was silly because if they couldn't get away, the pyroclastic flow would kill them for sure. So the decision was okay, and then they had a bit of luck but otherwise we wouldn't have movie, right? 4. The lake can't become acidic that fast Why not? If there's a real large crack underneath it, gigantic masses of sulfur could be released. I think it's possible, though not very probable. But again, this is a movie. It tries to show the otherworldly hostility of nature in the event of a large eruption. And that it does quite well. All in all, i think it doesn't get much more realistic in a Hollywood near-blockbuster disaster-action movie. It's not a documentary. I like documentaries about volcanoes, but this is fiction and it tries to tell a story. I think the movie hits exactly the sweet spot between storytelling and plausibility. So many more things could have been done wrong The helicopter could have worked just fine, the volcano could be of the Hawaii-type with primarily thin lava to begin with. The ash and the falling rocks could have been neglected as a lethal force, not to forget the pyroclastic flow, which is not a common element in volcano depictions and might have disturbed some viewers because they just don't know what that is and what it does and that it's in fact so super dangerous. Okay, enough of this subject. Some quick words on those other cinematic qualities I think the romance is pulled off well by both actors. The whole drama aspect comes across very natural and is not artificially loaded with forced conflict. They understood very well that the threat is the volcano and the volcano alone. I mean, you got a volcano. That kind of eruption is the most deadly thing that can happen to you, so why bother with a villain? Yet many scriptwriters would not lay off the habit of writing a villain in, just because that's what they usually do. And about the effects It's mostly modeling work, and you can see it. But then, i can also see CGI (as long as the movie is not called Gravity). I see both, and if it can't be done totally unnoticeably, i'm preferring the more organic look of models. The most important point is, that the look is consistent and believable, and this is the case here. After all, it's a disaster movie, so the story obviously is nothing world changing, but it works well. I'd say if you don't like Brosnan's and Hamilton's faces, this movie is not for you. But if you don't have a problem with them, it's a very entertaining movie, and for those not very into geology and volcanology it even provides a fresh and almost informative depiction of a real volcano eruption. Good movie, a narrow 7 if i consider all aspects of cinematic craftsmanship but it actually feels better than that.

Brosnan plays a workaholic volcanologist, Harry Dalton who has trauma issues who is sent to a small town in Washington State. He soon discovers that a dormant volcano might be showing signs of coming to life. He has a warm relationship with the town's mayor (Linda Hamilton) that the town of Dante's Peak is in danger.

Brosnan's work colleagues are a little bit too hip as they were in the film Twister as well. The special effects were the best part of the film when the volcano erupts and damages the town with very good miniature effects and CGI, although the CGI has aged over the years.The film itself is a little hokey, the script rather shaky and maybe needed another draft or two.

Linda Hamilton is Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak, who's taken with Dr. Dalton and keeps close by. Hamilton and Brosnan have very interesting, very authentic chemistry that makes Dante's Peak more than worth while. Brosnan and Hamilton is the movie's main sight, while the volcano of Dante's Peak is the movie's main attraction. The ever-present brewing volcano provides the ominous backdrop to the storyline implanting constant tension. There's no action or effects until the volcano erupts, but when it does, there's loads of it. Dante's Peak turns into an all out action-adventure with great set effects for large scale destruction. The presentation of the special effects is very well done. The movie is good before the volcano erupts still, by having a nice, hang around vibe and pace, good not to rush things. Dante's Peak's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve, but it is executed well. The film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing. Dante's Peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience. It's a well-framed story. I don't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints. I give Dante's Peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine, family fun.

There was a lot of people at risk during the eruption, pyroclastic clouds and the lava, there was also a dead couple floating in the Hot Spring. I think overall they could have added more action, less love and more humour otherwise this movie was brilliant!

This movie has strengths when coming to the volcanic effects e.g. the pyroclastic cloud and the unique eruption of the volcano. These fiery effects are realistic and believable. The plot of this film was intriguing but also had its downsides. A rewarding part of Dante's Peak was the tension that was gradually progressing throughout the movie. This was just enough to keep the viewer engaged and want to see the ending.Things that let this movie down were, when Pierce Brosnan drove over the flow of lava which just about melted his tyres, but somehow was unable to set the fuel tank on fire. Another, is when their dog made it across the lava and acidic river which easily could of killed the dog both times,these were unbelievable parts and didn't help the movie in anyway. Throughout this movie parts were skipped and there wasn't much time to familiarise yourself with the characters and their background lives.If re-making this movie I would change the story line and make it more educational and humorous. For me this movie lacked in humor and they must of found it difficult to disguise what was going to happen as you could clearly tell the volcano was going to erupt with one glance at it releasing its smoke. Dante's Peak could have been better but the effects and realistic plot is what made this movie stand out on educational purposes. For me I believe that this movie is good to show in schools as it lets you see just how villages,towns etc. react when under pressure and close to a major volcanic eruption.

The special effects didn't look like they were real and it sort of ruined the whole movie a little. I also didn't really like the way the movie jumped about so quickly from one thing to another and you were left wondering what happened during all those parts that the movie didn't show. And finally I would have also liked to see more of the volcano erupting because it only showed a little of the it erupting. But overall this movie was quite good but if it had better special effects and didn't jump about so much and you saw more of the volcano erupting then it would be a really, really good movie!

The movie had good special effects that looked realistic, and the volcano and ash cloud looked very good. It started off in the midst of an eruption of a volcano so it was tense and had you hooked from the start. I enjoyed the love story between the two main characters Harry(Pierce Brosnan) and Rachel(Linda Hamilton). I thought that it added a bit of life to it so it wasn't all a disaster movie. There were some moments that I found unrealistic such as the scene where the family are in the car during the eruption and they have to cross the lava flow, the temperature would have been at least 1000 degrees or possible more, the extreme heat would have done more than melt the tires, it would have lit the car on fire, and blown the fuel tank causing the car to explode! Also how did the dog survive through the eruption? It managed to find the family and was found perched on a rock surrounded by the lava flow. Being that close to it would have done damage to the dog and it being unharmed was slightly unrealistic. There was some sad moments in the film such as when the Grandma(Ruth) sacrificed herself to save the family. I thought it had a happy ending as well with Harry and Rachel becoming a couple and taking the kids to Florida to go fishing.

I know I did. It all started when I saw The Poseidon Adventure. Then I saw the Towering Inferno. On that disc was a copy of Volcano. I watched it and thought it was fantastic. Tommy Lee Jones was cool and the special effects were pretty great. So, I bought this used for half off and it completely blew (ha ha ha) Volcano out of the water. Here's why. First off, Dante's Peak skillfully builds up tension and interest by slowly introducing the characters. Dante's Peak has been criticized for being too slow, although there is a volcanic eruption in the first scene.Basically, there's this geologist (Pierce Brosnan) who travels to fictional Dante's Peak, Washington to oversee the local dormant volcano. The mayor (Linda Hamilton) is happy since the town has recently been named one of the most desirable places to live in America. This hot spring is turned into acid because of the volano (No joke, that's possible) and the geologist saves the mayor's kid. The mayor is grateful, and the geologist slowly bonds with the family. However, when the geolosist realizes that the mountain is giving off sulfur dioxide and that it is a ticking bomb, ready to explode. The geologist and the mayor both order an evacuation, but not everyone's exactly too eager to leave, as there is no proof that the volano is ready to blow. But it does, and it creates lahars (mudslides), tephra (airborne rocks the size of semi trucks), pyroclastic flows (gigantic clouds of heavy, superheated, pressurized gases), and ash (little shards of glass). Can they escape Dante's Peak, before the volcano buries them all? Okay, there are a few pros about this film. One, the special effects are awesome. There isn't too much lava, so it looks completely realistic, the tephra looks like it is coming at me, and the pyroclastic flows actually look like they are leaping off the screen. The acting is superb, not over-done, not under-done. Pierce Brosnan gets the perfect amount of root, sympathy, and depth. Hamilton gets the same. The problem is the kids. They are so whiny, stupid, and idiotic that they make me laugh. But other than that, the acting is superb. The plot is something we've all seen before, the unexpected romance, but this film, unlike Twister or Speed, actually makes it work. They actually build up to it, they seem perfect together, and they are pretty realistic characters.Okay, sure it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it.Worth a watch.

First of all after two days with no water he'd be dehydrated and on top of that he'd have suffered considerable blood loss from the compound fracture and be in severe pain. He would also be in shock. One of the first things a paramedic would most likely have gotten started before trying to remove him from the truck would be an IV line with saline to replace some of the lost fluids and treat shock. He would probably also have a fever from infection from an open wound being exposed to the dirty environment of that mine further contributing to shock. He would not have been vertical for very long but been loaded onto a stretcher very quickly. But of course the drama of the scene where they are all reunited would have been lost if our hero was on a stretcher.

Then in seeing the film you can see that the promise of destruction is fulfilled as the volcano does, in fact, erupt. All the usual clich√©s are here the lead scientist has had a loss in life, is driven by it to insist on the volcano erupting, people in his team doubt him, there is slowly mounting tension and ominous evidence, etc... but in the end he ends up being more than right as the volcano erupts and, oh boy, does it ever! The result is some of the most enjoyable scenes of sheer terror and destruction to ever rampage across a movie screen.The movie takes place in one town yet the production must have been massive as the 100 million dollar plus budget suggests. Since everything is pretty much destroyed via glorious classic practical effects; buildings, cars, helicopters, trucks, bridges... in fact the volcano unleashes such a hellish fury that it's name, Dante's Peak, is very appropriate and much more thoughtful than say, Volcano.The thing that usually kills a movie like this is the overdoing of effects and overdoing of plot. Depsite harrowing catastrophic destruction the effects are just enough for a movie like this, meaning when it's over no one will be disappointed or asking for seconds too quickly. Then the acting is too pretty much just right and straight to the point. Corny subplots are left out and the film, though ridiculously simple, is very focused on what it sets out to do.

Pierce Brosnan plays the role of the vulcanologist who tries to sound the alarm, and Linda Hamilton is the single mom and mayor who takes notice of the good doctor's warnings.There's a magical cinematic quality whereby the whole of a good movie is greater than the sum of its parts. In the case of Dante's Peak, however, the whole is about equal the sum of its parts.  Despite very strong (and expensive) special effects, Dante's Peak feels more like a TV movie.The movie begins with every clich√© in the book.  There's the lone scientist who predicts a disaster, and the boss who silences him to avoid a panic. There's a tourist town whose livelihood is threatened by just the talk of volcanic activity.  And there's even the children who disobey orders and head into danger to save a loved one, only to have to be rescued themselves.After the movie gets started, however, the cliches do take new '90s twists. The mayor of the town is actually the first to listen to the scientist, and she even calls a town meeting where she distributes an `emergency plan.' Our strong lead is a sensitive gent who lost his love to a volcano four years prior, and the mayor is a divorced mom with a mother-in-law who won't come down from the mountain.  Unfortunately, the original cliches don't hold up very well when resolved with a modern temperament-instead, they come off as bland and unexciting.The biggest weakness with this movie lies in the creation and development of the characters.  Pierce Brosnan is not a very convincing scientist, and his British accent does little to toughen up a role which needs rougher edges anyway.  If he's trying to be the strong, silent type, he comes off more bookish than anything else.  And when he loses his temper, he might as well be arguing a call at a tennis match.  Across the board, stock characters and a weak script really hurt, such as in the final scene where Brosnan calms the children by promising to take them on a fishing trip, of all things.The audience simply doesn't care about these people very much, so when the characters wind up in danger, there's little reaction to be had.  Where's the depth of these people?  For example, where is the mayor's inner conflict when she must decide whether to believe a lone vulcanoligist or protect the interests of a town she has been nurturing for nearly a decade?  The movie uses romance between our two leads to dodge these kinds of questions, and that sort of character development wouldn't be missed-as long as it was replaced by some other opportunities for depth.  It isn't.Special effects are first-rate in execution, and they are almost too good. They're a bit too clean and smack of CGI (Computer Graphics Imaging). Often times I found myself thinking, that's a CGI, that's not a CGI, etc.  The purpose of digital film enhancement is to fool the audience into not recognizing the enhancement at all, but Dante's Peak fails here.Dante's Peak romps around the countryside and offers colorful situations of all kinds.  And it wins bonus points because it really is fun to watch, particularly for the gee-whiz special effects.  But Dante's Peak could've been a lot more than what it is.  It's fun, but it doesn't feel `big.' The last half of the movie felt like a string of small action sequences glued together to create the impression of one big action sequence.  And in terms of character development, if the producers had simply stuck with the cliches that they started with, the movie might've been a lot better.

Yes, the effects (including earthquakes, floods, explosions, flaming lava flows and ashen downpours) look expensive and are generally impressive, except for some bogus miniature work, that is. The rest of Dante's Peak is the pits. Tired clich√©s dominate. The cookie-cutter characters are beyond dull, and the predictable plot devices are borrowed from Jaws and countless other, better disaster flicks. Dante's Peak is a picture postcard-pretty town in the Pacific Northwest that has just been voted by Money magazine the second-best place in America to live. Cash and business should come pouring in, and the citizens will be happy. Obviously, when the votes were counted, nobody mentioned the dormant volcano next door that's about to blow its top. So much for being #1 next year. Soon the locals are fleeing for their lives, and the town's big potential investor is heading south toward San Diego. This 1997 version has Pierce Brosnan (who wishes he were back in his James Bond tux, no doubt) and Linda Hamilton (who wishes she were in Terminator 3, no doubt). That's it for Dante's star sizzle. Who cares about watching anonymous actors being parboiled while skinny-dipping or having their legs eaten away by a lake turned to sulfuric acid? Wouldn't it have been more fun to watch Drew Barrymore and Matthew Perry dive into boiling water? I'm sure disaster vets like Borgnine, George Kennedy, Linda Blair, Roddy McDowall, Stella Stevens, etc. would have been thrilled to play Dante's Peakians.

After Rachel replied it was the red one her daughter said Oh! Oh that one.  Well, having been on the stage a few times I recognized a stage line and not a movie line.  One is subtle and the other is too obvious.  I know it's a little thing but since I want the move I rent or buy to be really good, little things like that bug me a bit.  Then in the course of the movie we have to deal with an idiot Grandma who doesn't have a clue.  I guess that's why she lives alone away from everyone.  I found myself not caring about her when she died and didn't feel the connection between her and her adopted family. While we're on the subject, why is it that the dog that runs away is soo ugly that your glad it's gone?  Did you notice it ran towards the lava that was headed towards them?  No big deal because the ugly dog lives. So much for the bad, now the good. When I watched Dante's Peak again I didn't mind the goofs as much because I knew they were there.  I liked Brosnan and even started liking Linda Hamilton in her roll as the Mayor of Dante's Peak.  The hardest thing for me to do was to see her in a romantic role as the only other movie I have seen her in was Terminator where she was absolutely cold (which was correct for her part).  Anyway, it took a second time thru to make me see her in a different role.  She wasn't too bad.  I guess that's the sign of a good actor.

My own rating system is based on how many times i could see it in a year without going crazy.  This would be a 3 out of 12 meaning I could watch it 3 times during the year without any brain damage resulting.  Not a lot of movies get over a three and only the best movies get a 5 or 6.

For anyone who thinks Volcano was better just because Tommy Lee Jones was in it and they think Linda Hamilton doesn't have enough real credits to her name, she co-starred in a movie with Tommy Lee Jones that was kinda lame.

As in all such movies, no one believes that the volcano will actually erupt BUT, you know what will eventually happen. The real star of this movie and what sets it apart from other similar films are its awesome special effects. Through the expert use of miniatures, computer animation et al, you really experience what it must be like to live through such a disaster. Buildings and freeways collapse, red hot lava flows everywhere, volcanic ash rains down upon the town and explosions abound. The actors merely serve as window dressing until the film's climax. Brosnan and Hamilton do the best they can with limited roles. Charles Hallahan as Brosnan's boss is excellent. Watch his expression of hopelessness and fear as he is swept away during the disaster. This film also has the requisite pair of kids (Jamie Renee Smith and Jeremy Foley) who cause their mother (Hamilton) additional worries when they try to rescue ex mother-in-law Elizabeth Hoffman when she refuses to come down from her isolated cabin to safety.

The first half of Dante's Peak is only moderately entertaining with Brosnan trying to convince his dumb-as-nails boss that this mountain means business. But the real excitement comes at the halfway mark when the volcano explodes and the special effects take over. The visual effects are very impressive in Dante's Peak, which puts the terrible effects in Irwin Allen's awful 1980 flick When Time Ran Out to shame. Brosnan and Hamilton turn in very good performances here, as do the two kids who play Hamilton's children. There are a few weaknesses in Dante's Peak which keeps it from being a great movie. It's too bad not everyone turns in a good performance in this film. Charles Hallahan and Elizabeth Hoffman have the most laughable parts in the film as Brosnan's boss and Hamilton's ex-mother-in-law, respectably. They provide the dumbest dialogue in the film. And it would have been better if the eruption had happened a little earlier instead of the mid-point of the movie. A couple of scenes in the first half are a little boring.

Having slugged our way through Volcano, we were not thrilled to be sucked into another volcano movie, but we decided to give it an optimistic try. Without Tommy Lee Jones, Volcano would have been completely intolerable. We felt sorry for Jones for having been roped into such a stupid movie. What made Dante's Peak more engrossing for us was the it could happen here feeling and the fairly smooth flow of plotline.  Volcano made us angry because the characters' behaviors seemed beyond stupid, in light of the circumstances.  It was as if someone asked them what's the worst, stupidest thing you could possibly do in this situation, and then told them to do it.  Volcano seemed so deliberately contrived, and it went on and on forever with contrivance after contrivance.  On the other hand, Dante's Peak moved along in a fairly logical order, allowing for some realistic human errors, such as the grandmother refusing to move, the children attempting to rescue her, and the boss who didn't want to unnecessarily upset the town.  Granted, if the acid in a lake can eat through a metal boat, it's gonna make quick work of a grandmother--so the grandmother/boat scene was foolish.  Also, a small truck cannot drive across molten lava and it is unlikely that a pickup can navigate a river.  If the director wanted us to believe in the truck's water ability, we should have been given a better reason for its having been equipped for water travel.  However, I don't know how he could have worked the driving over lava scene to make it more credible.  Perhaps a jump over a lava-filled crevasse or something.In spite of these flaws, the special effects were still convincing enough to keep us engaged.  The only time we began to get fidgety was during the tunnel scene in which Brosnan, attempting to make it to the truck, kept being pelted by falling rocks.  Either the rocks should have fallen at a somewhat constant pace or they should have fallen quickly once or twice. Unfortunately, the rockfalls kept recurring after every few steps taken by Brosnan, and every few moments after he entered the truck.  This repetition got lame awfully quick. Also, as the truck roof was caving in, it's elasticity cheapened the effect.  It was easy to picture a special effects employee leaning on the rubber roof over Brosnan's head.In spite of those things, we felt that the film portrayed a more realistic idea of what would occur if a dormant volcano near a small town became active.  With a few exceptions, the special effects were extremely well-done.  The acting was convincing, as well.  Linda Hamilton's coffee shop mayor reminded me of one of our local state representatives, who runs a small, popular nearby restaurant and nightclub.  Hamilton's character was friendly, helpful, and very likeable, much like our local rep, who's cheery smile and good work keep us voting for her.  Brosnan didn't appear to overexert himself, but he comfortably portrayed his usual charming, intellectual character.  The kids did a great job, and the volcanology crew was convincing.Because I usually find disaster movies somewhat trite, I didn't go out of my way to see this one, but now that I've watched it, I consider it one of the better ones.

Harry starts to pout again and its off to a roll in the hay with the mayor, Rachel.When disaster finally does strike, Harry appears to lose any ability of commonsense, needed for even the simplest of disasters.

Tragically (no pun intended), due to DP's earlier release, it failed to garnish either critical attention or popular attendance.  Like so many non-summer blockbusters, however, it also proved to be the better film.The first thing you think when attending a film about a volcano lava. Given this, it was figuratively a breath of fresh air to watch DP throw an entire aresenal of obstacles, one of which was lava, in the path of the protagonists and other characters in order to prevent the accomplishment of their goal to flee the town.  Unlike Volacno, they were not trying to stop a disater over which they have no control, nor were they trying to save their town.  And believe me, the fictional town of Dante's Peak is much more worthy of salvation than the actual city of L.A.DP provided its audiences with better performances, characters with whom you could actually associate, deaths that moved you, better special effects and musical score, and a much more believable, on-topic plot.  Concerning the latter, Volcano tried to interweave a self-reflective commentary on L.A. itself, which confused the purpose and altered not only the course of the lava (symbolic?), but also the course of the plot and the theme.If you want to watch a film about L.A. (really, how many of us can relate?), then Volcano is the film for you, but if you are looking for a good disaster film, then my money is on Dante's Peak.

After some preliminary research, Harry tells the town's major, Rachel Nando that the town should begin evacuation plans as he predicts imminent catastrophe. His boss, however and the local councillors are too cautious and do not want to scare investors away from the community so they call off the evacuation, insisting there is no need to panic - Disaster then strikes - the volcano erupts.My OpinionThe movie 'Dante's Peak' dramatises some real world concerns faced by communities which are located near active volcanoes.I thoroughly enjoyed Dante's Peak and believe that it is a great movie. The tension in the movie builds up very slowly with the two main characters, Harry and Rachel who develop a deep connection for each other and desperately fight for their own survival and the survival of others in the town.I thought it was an amazing action-packed thriller, which was full of excellent special effects. The plot is short and simple but there are so many special effects and drama that make it both very entertaining and a frightening suspense. The dramatic tension gradually increases as the volcano shows more signs of activity and eventually erupts and devastates the town.Overall, the movie is very realistic in that scientists, in many cases can anticipate volcanic eruptions. Harry Dalton was a acting USGS scientist (U.S. Geological Survey) scientist who do study and correctly predict in advance eruptions in real life.In many respects the movie's depiction of the enormous power unleashed during the eruption, the production of prognostic flows, clouds of volcanic ash and debris were very close to real life. However, lava flows tend to be thick and slow moving unlike the movie version!Volcanic ash clouds threatening the helicopters in the movie again is common in real life and the temperature change of the hot springs again is true to life, however it tends to build up more gradually. In the movie the town's water supply became contaminated when the volcano became restless and carbon dioxide killed the trees and wildlife &#x96; again this can happen in real &#x96; life but just more slowly!There is total chaos and everyone tries to escape at the same time and the excitement begins.The fight for survival is very gripping and the devastation is powerful.I felt extremely sad and very close to tears as the grandmother, Rachel's ex mother in law took the decision to die in the hot acid to save her grandchildren by pulling in the boat. I thought that this was horrific for the children to witness and I would not like to have been in such a position myself.The film has a geographically accurate basis, with a few exaggerations to achieve success. The opening scenes deal with real volcanoes and real science so it is very true to life. The images and sound quality are all excellent. I would thoroughly recommend this film to both teenagers and adults who are interested in romance, action and thrilling adventure.Stuart McCune "},{"Title":"Blew me away but not 100% right","Date":"25 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" I watched this movie in my geography class in school and it was very interesting and it was to help us on our topic of earthquakes and volcanoes.The movie has a lot of characters like the mayor the children and harry also the research team.Harry was from the land survey and was worried that the volcano was going to erupt so they set up a seismometer to see if the volcano is going to erupt.They also flew in a helicopter to see if there was any sulphur gas which was one of the signs the volcano was going to erupt.when it erupted it released a pyroclastic cloud with pyroclastic bombs fling around in side it some parts of this movie are realistic and some are not real at all.I am not going to spoil any more just go and watch this movie for the rest of the detail.directorRoger Donaldson "},{"Title":"pyroclastic mayhem","Date":"25 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" I enjoyed Dantes peak, the build up and eruption of the volcano were realistic, it showed me all the different signs that a volcano is a bout to erupt, e.g the trees dying on up the volcano, squirrels dying and the the large amount of sulphur.

How do I know this? There were many subtle and not so subtle references to the eastern Sierra region of California, such as the police chief or sheriff sending his wife to Big Pine or Lone Pine to visit her sister. Take a look at a map of California and you will see these towns south of Mammoth Lakes. In the 1990's, due to a large area of CO2 venting, mainly near the south side of Mammoth Mountain and a rise in the resurgent dome of the Long Valley Caldera, in which the town of Mammoth Lakes is located in, the media sensationalized the possibility of new volcanic activity in the area. They purposely misrepresented information and stated positions that have no basis in science. This movie is just one more effort to sensationalize the situation around Mammoth Lakes.Plenty of commenters above me have listed many of the stretches of reality shown in this film. I did not see where anyone commented on the scenes where the couple skiing on a closed run got swallowed up by a lava vent that opened up at the surface and then closed up. Come on, they showed deep snow on the rim of this vent as though the surface of the ground would not be heated up by this flow of lava towards the surface. This type of event would have melted snow for hundreds, if not thousands of feet around the vent, perhaps even miles. Then is magically closed up and shortly after nobody could find where this had happened after. A lava flow that close to the surface would have caused a phreatic explosion long before it got that close to the surface. A phreatic explosion is caused by lava flowing toward the surface coming in contact with ground water, which then is heated into steam very quickly, causing an explosion that forms a crater at the surface.The way that the USGS is depicted is very inaccurate, in spite of what some commenters said beginning on the first page. They did not represent the science of volcanology accurately either, although some of it, probably by accident, was somewhat on the fringes of the target. I haven't watched the movie since I saw it in the theater and have turned it off when it is on TV so I can't recall more specifically all the inaccuracies of this movie. A few weeks after the movie was shown in theaters one USGS employee made a fake snorkel out of cardboard and painted it silver and attached it to one of their SUV type vehicles. They drove it around the town of Mammoth Lakes and got a lot of double takes from folks.I take this position as the seismic, volcanic, and geological issues of the eastern Sierra are very familiar to me. I worked with the U.S. Geological Survey frequently as an employee of the U.S. Forest Service as most of the land in the Mammoth Lakes area is on the Inyo National Forest. I assisted them in locating and issuing authorizations for locating instrumentation used to study these issues. I was very much involved, first hand, with their research of the CO2 emissions that began in 1990 around Mammoth Mountain and near its south slope at Horseshoe Lake. I worked very closely with the USGS for 9 years. Many other researchers from universities and prominent laboratories conducted research in the Mammoth Lakes area as well. It was real privilege to watch real scientists at work.I knew this movie was going to be bad when a scene shown near the beginning of the movie involved a cabin that contained dangerous gasses. The producers really did poorly on this portion of the story. I can say that with more authority than anyone else as the incident involving a cabin, dangerous gasses, and someone nearly asphyxiated actually happened to me. No other incidents of this type have been reported around the U.S. before or since then.I gave this movie a 2 as it wasn't completely awful, but very close. It gets the second point only because it is a bad example of how poorly Hollywood is at telling a scientific story and that brought me a few laughs.

Hollywood rushed out a cluster of disaster films in this era designed to shock and astound audiences with massive CG inspired effects, which were vast becoming mainstream and affordable in their application of major studio films.  Each film attempted a larger, grander, direr situation for audiences to experience.  We were stuck in the middle of a tornado, (Twister) trapped underground a city, (Daylight) saw massive tsunamis wreak havoc, (Deep Impact) nearly wiped out by an asteroid (Armageddon) and found out what damage a volcanic eruption would do to LA. (Volcano)The unremarkable peers of Dante's Peak merely demonstrate why this film should not be underestimated or overlooked.  This film stands out in the pack as an intelligent, carefully paced disaster movie.The plot plays simply but effectively.  Harry Dalton (Brosnan), a US Geologist, has come to the picturesque town of Dante's Peak with a team of experts to monitor activity of its menacing volcano, which for about 3,000 years has remained silently dormant.   We know this 'sleepy' town is about to get a rude awakening.  Unfortunately for Dalton, his colleagues and most of the town think his theory of an eminent big bang is rubbish and his only believer is the town's Mayor, Rachel Wando. (Hamilton) The volcano subsequently erupts and these characters are 'in the thick of it' as they say.The surprising part of the story is the measured pace it gives the characters.  We get a long build up to the eruption, and the characters aren't rushed in their romantic moments or exposition.  We know that these characters have real lives, Dalton does field experiments on the mountain, and Wando works at her coffee shop.  The build up to the action accentuates its dramatic qualities, just as the characters aren't rushed, the audience isn't artificially forced into danger the minute the cinema lights go down.Perhaps the most intelligent aspect of the production is the casting.  The choice of Hamilton as Mayor Wando is inspired.  It is rare to see a female actor, chosen to play a romantic role opposite an attractive leading man such as Brosnan, who is over 30 and doesn't look like a variation of Barbie. Hamilton is an actor of courage and subtlety.  She knows strong characters, women who rely on themselves and their resolve to make it through. However, her intelligence is stimulating, and in Dante's Peak she gives Mayor Wando a sexy, sassy grounding in her realness and integrity.  She perfectly mirrors Brosnan, who is believable as the astute volcano expert.  It's easy to see Brosnan in any role that requires him to be heroic and say `well, that's just Bond.'  But that attitude is nonsensical.  The fact is, Brosnan has an engaging appeal to audiences, we want him to win, and we root for him and really believe this man could save the world.  No matter, not even a pair of glasses and straps hanging around his neck can make this man look ordinary. His face accounts for his knowledge.  A funny moment sees him pick up a rock and stare at it, Wando then remarks, `A man who looks at a rock must have a lot on his mind.'There is an adage about sexual tension that X Files creator Chris Carter used to say, in reference to the unresolved sexual heat between his characters, Mulder and Scully. It is the notion that if you get two intelligent people in a room together, sparks will fly. It is proved correct in Dante's Peak, and the fact that it works is testament to the talent of the two leads.Roger Donaldson is a talented Australian director who understands action and suspense.  His fourteen films to date as a director show an understanding of what makes tension on the screen.  (The Bounty, The Recruit, Thirteen Days.) The minute the volcano erupts we enter the action breathlessly and the direction of Donaldson evokes the destruction and panic in fine form.It would be easy for the story in Dante's Peak to be swept away violently by the river of lava gushing out the mountain's fiery mouth.  Thankfully, we have an intelligent, character-driven disaster movie that provides lots of action, lots of suspense and a little romance for good measure.  I think that's more than enough.

In Dante's Peak, we have a small town in the shadow of an active volcano, rather unconvincingly super-imposed on a location shoot. Pierce Brosnan, between jobs as 007, plays a geologist who comes to town to assess the volcano. Linda Hamilton as the widow mayor. These two are likeable enough, and they have their obligatory romance. But we also have her annoying kids, the grandma, the dog, and another merry band of scientists who are all class clown types. These merry bands can be found in other disaster films. Anyway, the volcano finally blows, with so/so pyroclastic flows and lava fountains.

Some clever aspects of the storyline 1) the hero drives his 4x4 through hot lava, get's stuck and we see the truck and tires on fire (plus Linda H helps us by saying the truck is on fire). But he downshifts and drives out. The truck's fire then goes out and the thumping tires then re-inflate themselves enough to outrace the volcanic explosion. 2) the only escape from the lava is via a boat across the lake. They then find a truck and drive a bit. The dog they had to leave behind manages to avoid the lava and the lake to catch up with them in time to jump into the burning truck and be saved. 3) They take a metal boat across the lake. The boat starts to smoke because the lake has become acid (as we see the boat melting Linda says Acid dissolves metal). The boat smokes and leaks (keep your feet up kids) for many minutes but they just make it to the shore.The morals and ending are nice and tight - worthy of any Disney or Ron Howard pap anyone who didn't believe the hero dies; the town elders and the bad guy (a helicopter pilot) really die; the hero, the kids and the dog are saved; someone almost ignores the rescue signal but then sees it just in time.Rates a 1 for storyline but has some OK special effects so we'll go with a 3.

Apparently the studio's in Hollywood believe that we all are nothing but simple minds who don't like to watch a movie that's at least a little bit challenging.I have to admit that the graphics really look nice. The eruption of the volcano is really very well done. Even about the scientific facts and words used in the movie I will not complain, apart from some minor things like a car driving over lava without catching fire. Overall it all seems realistic and that's not always very evident in Hollywood. But the main problem that I have with the movie is that it has really nothing new to offer.A scientist is send to a marvelous, almost perfect little village to investigate a neighboring volcano that has already been dormant for thousands of years. But of course the volcano is getting active again and our beloved scientist, who's falling in love with a local beauty (the local coffee shop owner and mayor of the village), warns the authorities that a disaster will be inevitable if they don't react immediately. Of course no-one believes him and the disaster happens.We all know what happens, some people die, but our main characters will survive the horror. No, if you are looking for something new, you better switch to something else, because you'll not find it in this movie. I give it a 5,5/10, which isn't even too bad for a disaster movie.

The plot goes like this&#x85; Harry who is a geologist is at another volcano eruption in Central America. He is going to collect his girlfriend. When he collects his girlfriend He drives away but after he gets further down the road his girlfriend gets hit by a pyroclastic blow which kills her. The next scene is where it brings us to modern-day where harry is sent to Dante's peak to look at a possible eruption. Harry thinks there is going to be an eruption but his boss Paul doesn't but Harry was right and there is an eruption. Harry then escapes with the mayor of Dante's peak and also her two children. Then there is a second eruption but Harry, Rachel and her two kids are in an old mine. Then soon after Harry uses the E.L.F to be located and they are rescued safe and well. The equipment they use is very expensive like the E.L.F this was on the side of The Spider. A robot with 8 legs that went into places which was too dangerous for Harry it also had a video camera and heat sensors. The characters in the movie fitted well with the story here is a list of them Harry &#x96;A geologist . Rachel-Mayor of Dante's Peak and mum of two kids. Ruth-Granny and mother in law.

There were scenes in the movie that were realistic, like the pyroclastic clouds and lava, although there were some unrealistic features too. For example, when Harry the vulcanologist drives over a lava flow successfully. This could not be possible as the tyres would melt and the car would probably go on fire. The unrealistic features kind of ruined the movie, but brought in a lot of action which made it more enjoyable.I love how the movie was based on a love story between Harry and Rachel (Dante's Peak mayor) but was also filled with lots of action.

St. Helens when she erupted?","Date":"10 March 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" 1997 delivered two volcano movies, Dante's Peak and Volcano. The latter film stars Tommy Lee Jones and takes place in Los Angeles. Volcanic activity in Los Angeles? They might as well have had the story take place in Ohio! Needless to say, the idea never tripped my trigger. Dante's Peak, however, has piqued my interest over the years. I've seen a couple clips of the film while channel surfing and each time I was drawn into the storyline. One clip I saw showed a skinny dipping couple in a hot spring suddenly get boiled to death because of the volcanic activity of the mountain. Another clip showed a handful of people trying to escape the volcano in a boat on a lake. The lake had become acidic because of the volcanic pangs of the mountain and all the fish were dead and the propeller on the boat melted away. These scenes convinced me that the film was worth catching some day.THE PLOT A scenic Washington town at the foot of a mountain is celebrating being nominated one of America's best small towns. Meanwhile a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey (Pierce Brosnan) sniffs around the massive peak and becomes convinced the Volcano is going to blow at any minute. The rest of the scientific team comes to town to investigate while Brosnan develops a relationship with the mayor (Linda Hamilton). Brosnan wants to put the town on immediate alert while the boss vulcanologist doesn't want to jump to conclusions and disrupt the town's economic interests. The volcano blows, of course.As you can see, the plot rips off Jaws, trading a Volcano for the shark, but it's effective. The thing about Dante's Peak is that IT'S BASED ON REAL-LIFE EVENTS. On May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washington blew her top. Although there was no decent sized town nearby, 57 people were killed and 250 homes, 47 bridges, 185 miles of highway, 15 miles of railway and hundreds of miles of forestry were obliterated. The eruption caused a massive debris avalanche, reducing the elevation of the mountain's summit from 9,677 feet to 8,365 feet and replacing it with a mile-wide horseshoe-shaped crater. Mt. St. Helens is even mentioned in the picture a few times.WHAT WORKS The cast is likable even though they do dumb things or react in a stupid fashion, e.g. the grandma who insists on staying on her mountain because it would never harm her (aduh). I always thought Brosnan was too dour as James Bond, but he's more likable and human here, albeit still serious. Anyway, I like the way the film takes its time to let us get to know the characters before disaster strikes. This works because, in the meantime, anticipation of the eruption slowly builds.I've read quite a few of the Amazon reviews and was surprised that no one had commented on the scenic locations. The town scenes were filmed in Wallace, Idaho. This quaint village sits at the foot of a big hill (we'd call it a mountain in the East), which was digitally enhanced to appear as a volcano in the film. I tell you what, they fooled me 'cause it sure looks like a real volcano. Anyway, the shots on the mountain and in the crater were filmed at none other than Mt. St. Helens, Washington (my brother incidentally lives a mere 50 miles north of there in Yelm but has mysteriously never climbed the volcano -- WIMP!).The F/X are outstanding. They used both miniatures and CGI. The volcano doesn't fully erupt until the last half hour of the film's 1 hour and 50 minutes runtime.WHAT DOESN'T WORK Some of the dialogue and acting is lame here and there and I find the idea of a truck driving through lava to be unbelievable -- it sure took a long time for the tires to blow -- but, then again, I don't really know how long thick truck tires would last under those conditions. Lastly, they could've done better with the women (e.g. the hot spring girl, etc.), although Linda's always likable.BOTTOM LINE Want to see what it might have been like to be near Mt. St. Helens when she blew her top? Dante's Peak is the next best thing to being there. It's one of the better disaster flicks.GRADE B+ "},{"Title":"A story of a volcano erupting in a small town,and the main character has to save the village","Date":"27 November 2013","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" I did not really enjoy this film as it was quite boring and dragged on a bit,also i found it a little Gory espeshily when the old lady legs were hanging of,also i found it a little scary,too scary for my liking.The effects were good though and quite believable.The beginning i found to be a little high strung and would have preferred it to have gone a little faster.I would not watch this film again.I would recommend it for people who enjoy si fi films and horror and also action.For this reason i am only giving it 1 star.

Opportunities 1.This movie had also a romantic genre in it involving Harry Dalton vulcanologist with Rachel Wando Town Mayor that didn't lead to anywhere Harry only said at the end of the movie that Rachel, the children Lauren and Graham and himself would do and do things when the volcano settled down but the movie didn't show it. 2.When the experienced team that Harry worked for looked up at the volcano it somehow seemed much far away than when Rachel looked up at it from Harry's jeep window when it had exploded. 3.It was kind of obvious that the volcano was going to explode with all the tension before it explode but sill Paul the experienced teams boss still denied when Harry pleaded with him to put the town on alert, he wouldn't because he did not believe Harry that the volcano was going to explode.

Like Titanic there is a love story, but this story is very flat and it is the volcano that dominates the scene and not the romance. It is the volcano that tries to pull the lovers apart and even then they just appear to be more of a couple of kids who really like each other than true lovers.The focus of the movie is the destruction caused by the volcano. Though we know that the volcano is going to erupt, it wouldn't be a movie if it didn't, we are kept waiting by watching the volcanoes throes. The experts say that what is happening happens with volcanoes and doesn't mean that they will erupt. It is the huge flows of lava, the destruction of the city, and the many explosions, that keep us interested. Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) is only in the movie to give the hero, Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan, whom I think plays a reasonable scientist) a heroine to rescue.The scientist is the hero in this movie. The main reason is because he knows what is going on. He has been around volcanoes before, and has even been around them when they were erupting. He is a bit of an action hero, but he is not the ex-commando that one would expect to dominate the action movie. In fact there is not ex-commando that plays a part in the movie, only scientists. Even though this wouldn't be out of place, I find it better that it is the scientist who is the hero for it, to me, is not unreasonable. Back in the 18th Century, the scientist was the hero as he was going into the unknown. The discoveries were what made men, and still do to an extent, and it is good that the scientist still receives the recognition that he should.Self sacrifice plays a little part in this movie when Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman) throws herself into a lake of acid to push the boat to shore. One may question about the possibility of a lake of acid and using my limited knowledge of chemistry, I can say that it is possible. Harry, when he first arrives at Dante's Peak, tests the acidity of the lakes on the volcano. This is because volcanoes produce sulphur dioxide (SO2). When sulphur dioxide comes in contact with water (H2O) it creates sulphuric acid (H2 SO4).Dante's Peak is good for a disaster movie, though there is nothing much new in it.

From the prophylactic clouds to the running lava to the way the earthquake sequences were shot, the erupting volcano looked really cool.But it only *looked* cool. This film is so incredibly predictable that there is no suspense throughout this movie whatsoever. The audience gets a good taste of every conceivable archetype that could appear. A boss who's underplaying everything and acts as the films villain, an expert no one will listen to, the stubborn old woman who won't leave her home even when it's three minutes away from burning down, the token children who are already one inch away from death...And the scientific inaccuracies are astounding, which includes a truck that *drives* *over* *lava*. If cars could do that as easily as it was in that particular scene, there wouldn't be much need in leaving, would there? Nothing unpredictable happens in the film. All of the good guys live, anyone who was bad or stubborn dies.The highlight of the film was Pierce Brosnan, who seems to be too good to even be in the film. He doesn't give what I would consider to be a powerhouse performance, but compared to all of the other relatively lazy acting that appears in the film, it's easy to view his performance as being exceptionally awesome.At the end of the day, Dante's Peak is nothing special.

Some of the sequences, such as when Ruth's cabin is inundated with lava, are breathtaking, so much so that you start to think the lava is real and is going to flood straight into your living room. The first hour or so is reminiscent of Alien, as we know something ominous is lurking but can't quite put our finger on an exact time but we know all hell is going to break loose. The best part of Dante's Peak for me, though, is Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton's fantastic chemistry. This is a couple you truly root for, and the intimate dialogue they share at certain parts of the film are the movie's most memorable moments. Only complaint would be the supporting cast--- not as dynamic as the leads and the film suffers for that to a degree. It's not the best action movie I've ever seen and I think the ending could have been slightly more dramatic and lava-filled.

So it is with films about volcanoes. Although there had been earlier films such as The Last Days of Pompeii and Krakatoa- East of Java, both based on real disasters, volcanic eruptions were one form of catastrophe omitted from the great disaster movie cycle of the seventies. After a lull in the eighties, there was something of a revival of the genre in the nineties, and 1997 saw two volcanic films, Dante's Peak and Volcano. Whereas the latter film describes a volcano which (improbably) appears from nowhere in downtown Los Angeles, the former is set in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State and is based in the real-life eruption of Mount Saint Helens in 1980.Dante's Peak is the name not only of a fictitious volcano but also of the small town that nestles at its foot. The name is an obvious allusion to the Italian poet Dante Alighieri; although he also wrote about Purgatorio and Paradiso, he is the man who gave the English language the word Inferno. His name has become associated in the popular imagination with all things hellish; I doubt if the adjective Dantean would ever be used to describe anything heavenly.At the beginning of the film, however, Dante's Peak does seem a heavenly place to live. It is surrounded by beautiful mountain scenery, has recently been voted the second-best place to live in the USA and the neighbouring volcano has long been dormant. Reports of increased levels of volcanic activity, however, mean that Harry Dalton, a scientist with the US geological survey, is sent to investigate. (Dalton is played by Pierce Brosnan, who was the current James Bond in 1997. Is it a coincidence that he shares his surname with Brosnan's predecessor in the role?) Dalton concludes that there is a high risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future, and advises that the town be evacuated.Disaster movies often incorporate a sermon against the sin of avarice; the disaster must be seen to have been caused by, or at least exacerbated by, human greed. Thus the fire in The Towering Inferno breaks out because a sub-contractor has tried to cut costs by using substandard wiring, initial warnings about the shark in Jaws are ignored because local vested interests do not want to frighten away the tourists and the collision with the iceberg in Titanic occurs because the ship's owners, for commercial reasons, have ordered the captain to steam at full speed through the ice-field. Similarly, Dalton's warning falls on deaf ears because the Town Council of Dante's Peak are worried that any reports of volcanic activity in the area will frighten away not only tourism but also business investment.More surprisingly, Dalton's warning is ignored not only by self-interested local politicians but by his own superior Dr Dreyfus, the sort of scientist who values public relations more highly than public safety, who reassures the local residents that they have nothing to worry about. Of course, in films of this nature the prophet of doom is never believed but always proved right (the prototype of this figure seems to have been Cassandra in Homer's Iliad). In another moralising touch the false comforter Dreyfus is one of those killed by the eruption. (The first victims are a young couple who sneak off to a hot pool for some alfresco sex, only to be scalded to death when the temperature of the water suddenly shoots up. In The Towering Inferno a couple having an extra-marital affair are among the first victims of the fire, which suggests that the makers of disaster films like to preach against lust as well as avarice).In common with a number of disaster movies, Dante's Peak falls naturally into two acts, (although here there is also a prelude in which we see an earlier eruption which killed Dalton's girlfriend, and fellow-vulcanologist, Marian). Act I allows the Cassandra-figure to issue his warnings and also sets the human background to the disaster by giving us a select group of characters with whom we can identify. In this case they are Dalton himself, Rachel, the divorced female mayor of the town with whom he becomes romantically involved, her two young children, and Ruth, the feisty but stubborn mother of Rachel's ex-husband. Act II deals with the disaster itself, the main source of drama being whether or not the select group will be able to escape with their lives.The scenes of the volcanic eruption are well done, but as with many disaster movies the special effects mean that the human stars tend to fade into the background. Brosnan is the best-known star here, but I felt he came across as too cool and laid back, not showing much emotion even when talking about Marian's death. This style of acting works well in the highly-stylised Bond films, but disaster movies require something a bit more naturalistic. I felt that Act I was too drawn out and that the actual eruption could have started earlier in the proceedings. Just as the real star of Titanic is the ship and the real star of Towering Inferno is the fire, so the real star here- the part that viewers will watch the film for- is the massive fireworks display in Act II. Dante's Peak is not the greatest disaster film, and has a few scientific inaccuracies, but at least it is considerably better than Volcano, which frequently managed to stretch credibility past breaking-point. 6/10 "},{"Title":"It's coffee time!

As for the other movie volcano with tommy lee Jones, it didn't come close in anyway to the insurmountable disaster that volcanoes have. Roland Emmerich will have to do better next time in his disaster tries down the road. As for this movie i was very impressed.

And his boss, the man who recognizes that he is the leading expert, calls him on the carpet and tries to play politics with the town council. If someone told me my volcano was going to blow up in my face soon, I sure as Hell would not be worrying about the future economy at the possible expense of people's lives.There was one reviewer who said that Ruth's stubbornness was not believable. On the contrary, when you are older, and I can speak from experience, you don't want to give up your security, whatever life around you may be saying. Don't forget there were a number of people who died when Mt. St Helens blew in 1980 because they were just like Ruth.

In movies, there are always heroes who alway survives conditions in the movie that will actually kill without doubt. I personally think that Dante's Peak is one of the best volcano films I've seen. Some facts sacrificed for our entertainment and action, there are some examples of where the movie changed the facts for us to enjoy like - Glass lake couldn't have turned that acidic that quickly. (the bit where the Grandma's legs are nearly melted off) - The pyroclastic flow should have smashed the green jeep into pieces before it even got close to the underground hideout, seriously what affordable land vehicle can exceed 800kmph? - Too many people escaped the volcano's wrath while people would normally have a few minutes. - The noise of the eruption shouldn't have been heard by anyone in a 60mile radius. - The actual lava was too runny for a composite volcano of that size, the lava should have been slow and thick. - The tyres didn't melt in the extremely hot lava when it got stuck.Overall, I think that the movie itself was too concentrated on the relationship of Harry and Rachel not the actual eruption itself. I suggest a second look for people who have already watched it.

If you drop a frog in scalding water, he¬¥ll try to jump, to get away from it. But when you boil  the water, slowly, with the frog already in it, the frog will dye, and that¬¥s how the story, this story, goes.  Wonderful movie. Fine suspense, good plot (although not astonishingly original), good and well developed characters, good acting and believable special effects. And a fine soundtrack.  Pierce Brosnan is the man of the moment, no doubt about it. He is, by far, one of the best irish actors to appear on celluloid...and no one has yet seen his true potential. And this man knows his choices - he has the eye for detecting good scripts and good movies - from The Lawnmower Man, to Thomas Crown Affair.  Dante¬¥s Peak is a movie about family. It portrays a small town where almost everybody would like to live in - cozy, small, nice, friendly. The delivering of a prize to the mayor of this town is a proof of that.  But before settling the viewer¬¥s attention on Dante¬¥s Peak, the director tells us what happenned to Brosnan's companion when a volcano somewhere in Colombia (?!) erupted. This introduces to the real undertone of the movie - it¬¥s a tragic story, deep down.  Brosnan¬¥s character (a vulcanologist - no kin to mr. Spock, he points out) warns the inhabitants of this town that something may be brewing beneath the earth. As usual, people do not believe him, as happens with every man or woman who tries to reveal new things or break news. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie...until, at last, something tragic happens.     The director showed a firm hand while shooting this story. It¬¥s clear that he showed us and told us things exactly the way he wanted them to be showed or told. Ok, there is no surprise (at least not a big surprise) in the outcome of the story but there¬¥s no need  for it. The sheer intensity of the events, the realism - all this is enough to grip the viewer from beginning to end. The menace to everyday normal life is tremendous, andfamilies must act accordingly or perish. The town perishes, some lives are lost - all due to lack of care and planning. So Dante¬¥s Peak becomes, like Deep Impact, a warning.    Pierce Brosnan is great, Linda Hamilton is good enough, and the kids, the grandmother and the colleagues of Brosnan¬¥s character are excellent.  The science behind the movie¬¥s plot is accurate enough a la Hollywood, naturally.  When I saw this movie, I felt I was in front of a fine work. Money spent on this movie is well spent, as it teaches us many lessons - besides being a pure piece of entertainment.  I recommend it, I loved it. I wish there more movies like this one and Deep Impact -  very well crafted catastrophe movies, not to everyone¬¥s liking, but good examples of how sucessfull a story like this can be when is well told.

This $100 million dollar plus opus is the second major Hollywood disaster flick to explode across the big-screen, trailing the Sylvester Stallone epic Daylight. Meanwhile, Dante's Peak imitates but never surpasses previous classics like the 1972 version of The Poseidon Adventure or the 1974 opus Earthquake. Interestingly, audiences will find little in the way of sex, nudity, violence, and profanity to complain about in this harmless, PG-13 rated, special effects laden melodrama.Brosnan plays volcanologist Harry Dalton who has just recovered from a South American blast that claimed his girlfriend's life. Four years later, as Dalton is about to embark on a vacation, his boss sends him off to the Pacific Northwest to check out a sleeping volcano. Dalton arrives in the small town at the foot of the volcano as its Mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton of The Terminator) accepts an award for hailing her hamlet the second best place to live. When Dalton alerts them about the volcano, the townspeople start to fidget. They have just convinced an investor to erect a million-dollar business in their town. Dalton's boss rolls in not long afterward and calms their fears. He appreciates the damage that a false alarm can do and tells Dalton to take a hike. Dalton decides to stick around as much for the volcano as the pretty mayor.Daylight scenarist Leslie Bohem's less than molten script criss-crosses scenes from Steven Spielberg's Jaws and James Goldstone's When Time Ran Out. Dante's Peak turns out to be just as formulaic as both Jaws and When Time Ran Out. You know that the dog that gets lost will be rescued before the lava flows fry him. The characters that shrug at the idea that the volcano will ignite get their just comeuppance.Dante's Peak gets off to a riveting start with a volcanic eruption in South America, and then subsides as the filmmakers lay out the story and deploy their characters. Of course, Mayor Wando has been left high and dry by his husband and has two children to raise. Gradually, signs of danger appear and Dalton smells the ash in the air before the mountain blasts itself to smithereens. Two lusty teenagers die early when a hot springs pond scorches them alive. Despite solid computer evidence to the contrary that the volcano won't explode, Dalton keeps crying wolf until it is too late.The early matte shots of the volcano look rather cheesy, but the eruption sequence is as well done as the nuclear blast in Andrew Davis' Chain Reaction. Freeways collapse and buildings crash into rubble as extras dodge flying debris and howl in agony. Director Ronald Donaldson, who also helmed Species, The Getaway, and The Bounty, seems more preoccupied with hysteria than gut-wrenching shock tactics. Nothing really scary or gory jumps out at you in Dante's Peak. A couple of decent scenes stand out in an otherwise staple plot. A boat ride down a river turned into acid yields a chill or two, and your skin will crawl when Dalton legs it ahead of a lava flow.Dante's Peak suffers because the cast consists largely of unknowns, so you won't feel much sorrow when a character croaks. Nobody dies a genuinely nasty death as in either The Poseidon Adventure or Earthquake. Of course, Mayor Wando's children are thrust into harm's way so that Dalton and she can rescue them. Dante's Peak features a fearless grandmother that willing to risk death to save her relatives. Only toward the end when everything seems undeniably bleak does it look like our hero and heroine will survive this catastrophe. Although Dante's Peak is certainly no Twister, this potboiler should keep the kids entertained and might even occasionally distract adults, too.

The casting is perfect, the script was well written and the graphics is what really makes this movie good.Pierce Brosnan really holds this film together. I think he's a great actor and played his part really well, a volcanologist who checks out the town, convinces his boss Dreyfus that the town should be on alert and wants to protect the citizens of Dante's Peak and even forms a relationship with the mayor, Rachel Wando and eventually becomes fond of her children Lauren and Graham. I'm not too fond of Linda Hamilton but she plays well in this film.Dante's Peak and Volcano were released the same year (1997) but Dante's Peak did better at the box office. I couldn't really get into Volcano, even after seeing it countless numbers of times. Dante's Peak is more accurate, unlike Volcano. The director wanted to bring in real volcanologists for Dante's Peak to make scientific accuracies. They thought the film would sell better by adding these scientific accuracies and show the audience what would really happen during an eruption. Now, I've seen a lot of comments about how there are tons of mistakes in Dante's Peak. No movie is perfect and they're not going to add every single accuracy into a movie. They are allowed to approach the film however they want too. The pyroclastic cloud at the end is what really gets to me when I watch this film. Every time I watch it, when Dalton is driving away from the pyroclastic cloud, I always think for a minute they aren't going to make it, even though I know what's going to happen. They did an outstanding job on the graphics, looks so real.I have to say that Dante's Peak is one of my all time favorite movies. I've seen it possibly over 200 times over the last 12 years and still love it. It's a brilliant movie and I'm glad the director decided to do it after debating for a year if they should do the movie or not. It was his best move. I wish movies like this were still being made. Now we have stupid, pointless movies like Disaster Movie that I have no intention on watching, although I hate to say I have seen it, and hated it.

Watchable big budget disaster flick.","Date":"30 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Dante's Peak is set four years after United States Geologist Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) lost his girlfriend Marianne (Walker Brandt) to an erupting volcano & starts as his boss Dr. Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan) calls him to go to the small Northern Cascade town of Dante's Peak to carry out some basic checks. Harry travels to Dante's Peak & quickly becomes convinced that the volcano overlooking the town which has laid dormant for years is about to erupt. At first no-one believes him & the townsfolk don't want to scare local businessmen away from the area so try to keep it quiet, unfortunately Harry is right & the volcano erupts with the entire town of Dante's Peak in it's destructive path...Directed by Roger Donaldson this fairly entertaining big budget natural disaster film which demonstrates how vicious the fury of mother nature can be is one of two halves, the first half is rather talky & is there merely to pass the time until the second half when the volcano actually erupts so the big budget special effect set-piece action scenes & destruction can begin. The script follows the usual disaster film rules, it focuses in on one person who know's whats coming yet no-one believes them & their attempts to warn people, it also focuses in on a normal family to add a bit of human interest & in particular two cute little kids, there's even a bit of dramatic incident when a couple of the main character's die although you don't really care that much as most of them are pretty clich√©d. I am not sure if Dante's Peak is scientifically accurate or not although one would suspect that factual liberties have been taken in the name of entertainment, the acid lake at the end for instance just doesn't sound that plausible to me. Once the action kicks in Dante's Peak becomes a lot of fun amid all the destruction, near misses & special effects although it takes quite a while to get there & the journey there isn't entirely pleasant. Also someone should tell the makers of Dante's Peak that lava has a temperature in excess of 1000 ¬∞C & trying to drive through it with rubber tyres would just not work. At all.Unusually the special effects in Dante's Peak is a mix of traditional model work, on set mechanics & effects & CGI computer effects rather than if it was made these days as it would almost certainly be entirely CGI. The mixture of special effects work highlights the respective strengths & weaknesses, the model work for instance sometimes doesn't quite match up to the on-set stuff as the shades of colour of cars & the light in the sky can differ slightly between shots & of course CGI can at times just look like a bad computer graphic but overall I did like the mixture of effects work & the budget was suitably high enough for them to be of a good standard throughout. The final forty odd minutes features plenty of action & destruction from exploding helicopters to rivers of lava, from raging rivers to acid lakes, from collapsing Churches to collapsing freeways, from crashing cars to daring rescues, from out-driving eruptions to collapsing mines to the destruction of an entire town there's enough packed into the final forty minutes to keep anyone entertained, it's just a shame about the first hour or so that feels rather pedestrian & forgettable by comparison.With a supposed budget of about $104,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it, mostly during the final forty odd special effects laden minutes I would assume. Filmed around California the actual St. Helens volcano was in Washington & was digitally added to various shots while the town used was in Idaho. The acting is alright, Brosnan & Hamilton make for a fairly forgettable & dull duo while the kids are annoying.Dante's Peak is a perfectly watchable big budget disaster flick showcasing how savage mother nature can be, while the last forty minutes is undoubtedly where the majority of the entertainment value lies the film as a whole is decent enough.

The writers of this film have earned themselves a place in one of the circles of hell for this inaccurate, unbelievable, and ultimately uninteresting movie.Dante's Peak actually refers to a fictitious town at the foot of a dormant volcano in the cascades. The volcano begins showing potential signs of life, so the USGS sends their best man, Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) to investigate the situation. Harry's been battling his own demons since his girlfriend, Marianne (Walker Brandt) was killed four years earlier during an eruption in South America. Harry meets up with the town's mayor, Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton), and quickly has cause to believe that the volcano will erupt. He is working out an evacuation plan with the town council when his boss, Paul Dreyfuss (Charles Hallahan), arrives and puts the kibosh on the whole thing with words of wisdom about not creating a panic until they have more evidence. By the time Harry manages to convince Paul that an eruption will indeed take place, it begins before they can safely evacuate the town. To further complicate matters, Rachel's children, Lauren (Jamie Renee Smith) and Graham (Jeremy Foley), have gone off to the volcano to convince their grandmother, Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman), that she should leave the mountain, which she stupidly and stubbornly refuses to do. Harry and Rachel race against time, lava, ash, and pyroclastic flows to save the kids and their grandmother from the evil volcano.I'm not a vulcanologist, but even as a layman, I had to question the scientific accuracy of the film to the point where I did a little research. I discovered whole websites devoted to pointing out the inaccuracies of this film. Sadly, they start in the opening scene where a lava bomb burns through the roof of the truck and lands on Marianne's head, killing her. While you would indeed die if a lava bomb landed on your head, steel has a higher melting temperature than liquid lava, and a solid piece of rock flying through the air would have cooled to the point where it couldn't burn through steel. The scene where the hikers are boiled in the hot springs is also way off base. Hot springs are a result of magma heating rocks which in turn heat the water. Unless the magma came in direct contact with the water, the water would heat gradually enough that any bather would have plenty of time to get out before getting burnt. And if the magma had come in direct contact with the water, the resulting steam explosion would have ripped away half the mountain - end of movie. Likewise, no lake would turn to acid that quickly, and even if it did, it couldn't eat through a metal boat in a matter of minutes, nor would it cause burns that severe on flesh covered in denim, which is a pretty heavy material. Lastly, a pyroclastic flow is hot gas, which will go anywhere it can get in. They couldn't have hidden from it in the mine unless they had been able to seal the entrance so that it was airtight, which would have meant they would eventually run out of air themselves. Someone didn't do much research in writing this screenplay.To further stretch our credibility, are we to believe that Harry didn't notice something coming through the roof of his truck, or smell the burning hair and flesh as his lover expired without a sound? Rachel doesn't see the faces of the hikers boiled in the hot springs, yet she claims to not recognize them (she knows every ass in town?). Apparently, swarms of earthquakes and deformation of the ground, two of the most common signs of an impending eruption, fail to convince Paul that one is about to happen, yet when Harry shows him a glass of dirty water he's convinced (I'd be worried every time they cleaned the water mains if it worked that way). Are we really to believe that two children under the age of twelve could drive a truck up a mountain while it's erupting? How do you outrun a pyroclastic flow, which can easily outdo a car, on four flat tires? And considering Harry nearly gets crushed as the mine continues to collapse, and the others don't have much food or water, how are they able to walk out of the mine with little or no ill effects? We've definitely stretched the limits of credibility beyond breaking here.Unfortunately, the acting fares little better than the writing. Neither Brosnan nor Hamilton manages to rise above the material. While they don't rate much chemistry with each other, they do at least manage to make you care about their characters, as does Hallahan, whom you route for even though you know he's doomed. Not so for Hoffman, who is irritating from her first moment on the screen until her last. Smith and Foley present two of the most annoying kids you could imagine, and in the end, you wish Harry and Rachel had simply left them all to their fate on the mountain. The USGS team is enough to make you glad you don't work with them, and their performances don't rate individual mention.The only good part of the movie was the special effects. The scene where the lava comes through Ruth's living room wall was good, and the actual explosion of the mountain was awesome. Pity you have to sit through such a bad movie to get to them.No doubt a movie which portrayed a volcanic eruption accurately could be made entertaining. Most movies tend to sacrifice accuracy for entertainment value. Unfortunately, this movie sacrificed both.

Although it may seem more likely that a dormant volcano comes back to life than a volcano that unconvincingly pops up in the middle of L.A., DANTE has taken the lava-toasted taco for the worst of the annoying strain. Pierce Brosnan's unintentionally funny dialog was by far the worst, aside from those annoying over-acting kids. I was especially annoyed with the kids, who clearly couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. Linda Hamilton-well-lets just say she's seen better days. The effects, on the other hand, exceeded that of VOLCANO and that, my friends, is where DANTE peaks over its competition. Thats all. Nowhere else.  *1/2 out of four. -You know its BAD! ITS BAD!

Dante's Peak won that race by a nose with it's release date coming in February, and Volcano's coming in April.  In the end it doesn't matter which film won the race as both are nothing more than a couple of tired old nags that belong in the glue factory.In the seventies Hollywood gave us a satchel full of Disaster films such as this.  Most of those were usually filled with an underwhelming all star cast placed smack dab in the middle of some impending doom whether it was jetliners with holes poked in them, skyscrapers lit up like a blow torch, overturned ocean liners, or earthquakes rocking the California coast.  In the nineties, we were still getting the disaster films, but the all-star has been casts seem to have been done away with. Instead we get a few well known cast members sleep walking through an exercise in how to survive nature's peril.  In Dante's Peak they throw Pierce Brosnan who is moonlighting from his 007 job along with Terminator cast off Linda Hamilton at us to gawk at.  Brosnan should have just taken the time off and Hamilton should have looked for another gig.Resident volcano expert Harry Dalton(Brosnan) comes to the town of Dante's Peak to find out whether or not the local volcano is still dormant or is ready to pop it's cork.  Harry, you see, was in love with another volcano expert he worked with who just loved to get up close and personal with them. Unfortunately for Harry, she gets bopped in the head during one such explosion and that's the end of her.  I have good theory as to why this was written into the story line.  It helps explain Brosnan's woeful unattached acting performance.  Since he's supposed to be moping over his lost love, he can now mope through the whole film and he excels at it.Linda Hamilton is the Mayor of Dante's Peak.  Unlike her character of Sarah Connor in the Terminator films who took action when things weren't looking too good, as Mayor and Widow Rachel Wando she does nothing much more than run around the mountainside looking worried and fretting about her kids and her mother-in-law who lives on the mountain.  The mother-in-law, Ruth, is played by Elizabeth Hoffman, and is supposed to be just like that guy who stuck around Mount St. Helens till the bitter end refusing to move from his home.  Here it just enables the writers to throw in the idiotic plot development where the kids and Rachel have to go and rescue her just as Dante's Peak is spewing ash and lava all over the countryside.  It's supposed to add suspense and excitement, but only serves to up the stupid level.  For one thing, Ruth is annoying enough that we don't care whether she is rescued or not, and second, the two kids (Jamie Ren√©e Smith and Jeremy Foley) have a high annoyance level of their own and we end up rooting for Dante's Peak instead of them.One thing they have held over from the disaster films of the seventies is the terrible on screen chemistry of the two main love interests (see Charlton Heston and Karen Black in Airport 1975, Charlton Heston and Genevieve Bujold/Ava Gardner in Earthquake, Paul Newman and Faye Dunaway in The Towering Inferno, Jack Lemmon and Brenda Vaccaro in Airport 1979).  I can understand that it can be difficult to develop a love interest when certain doom is clouding the horizon, but I'm of the impression that if Harry and Rachel were to meet under normal circumstances they would shake each other's hands and be on their way.There are truly some ridiculous scenes in this film.  These are the moments we would usually just overlook and go on if we were at least being entertained somewhat by the proceedings but since we are not, they stand out like the Rock of Gibraltar.  We get people in a jeep riding a lava flow, Pierce Brosnan paddling a boat with his hand in an acid filled lake and not being any worse the wear for it, we get a couple of cute dog moments, we get a ridiculous scene of our cast trying to outrun a cloud of ash in a jeep and so forth and so on.Also on hand is Charles Hallahan as Brosnan's doubting Thomas boss Paul Dreyfuss who is made to believe in the eruption only when it's too late to do anything about it.  There's always one such character in these types of films, but at least Hallahan's doubts come from logical assumptions instead of the blatant idiocy usually given these characters.  At least that was refreshing if nothing else is.There is nothing about Dante's Peak that you'll believe for one second. Everything about it is below par, and not worth one second of your time. If you want to watch a volcano in action, I suggest reading something about Mount St. Helens.  Even if such books don't entertain you, at least you'll learn something important  Stay away from Hollywood films about volcanic eruptions.My Grade D "},{"Title":"More Cheese than Domino's Pizza !!!!","Date":"3 July 2005","Score":"4 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Dante's Peak is very predictable in its plot and storyline. The main character's wife is killed and he becomes a recluse(like this scenario hasn't happened before!) Of course the title of the movie is the same name of the town which is a Redneck Pompeii about to happen complete with lily white charm and gumdrop smiles.But what's really irritating is when the whole town refuses to leave until the last second when the volcano explodes! Is there any intelligence in this town or they just don't believe the laws of nature and the laws of averages?! Since this podunk, white-trash hamlet doesn't believe in the Law of Averages, Dante belches out soot, ash, steam and lava, it's that precise moment, when the whole village packs up and heads for the hills. Or in the case of this godawful movie, scream and run about in a frenzy like headless chickens! One family was so consumed with fear that they left their child behind! WTF?! Look I've seen videos of 9/11 and even those people didn't run amok that way! But that isn't why I hated this movie.But wait there's more!!! What really makes this movie suck is the Mayor's dips*&t children no older than 12 rescuing their grandmother on the mountain where volcanic ash and lava is spewing about. Duh! that's a genius idea! NO! IT ISN'T! Another moment where this Dante's Mistake shines is when the Pierce and the Mayor follow the children up into the mountains while in a heavy-duty SUV that fords the river.But wait there's more!!! Several desperate,retarded, village idiots in a fit of blind panic of primal intuition decided to play follow the leader into the damn river...IN THEIR CARS! Which leads to the part of the mountain that has lava flowing down it. WTF?! Thus, proving that evolution passed these country bumpkins by at least 1.3 million years. Speaking evolution, by the looks of things, Dante's Peak sounds like they never even heard of the concept of EVOLUTION. But wait there's more!!!! When our main characters have rescued Grandma they are feet away from molten lava when and should've been vaporized. Not only the same damn thing should've happened to the fish in lake which turned to acid. Not only that, but shouldn't the characters suffocate from the thick blinding ash that has covered everything. Why was this movie made...I don't know! "},{"Title":"WARNING!

This movie has so many unrealistic elements you could cry.  How about a pick-up on fire truck driving through killer hot lava? Or how about two small kids driving a big four wheel drive truck up a mountain where airborne ash makes visibility zero? And I just love how time is eliminated as a factor here, sure, they talk about not having time, but I guess there's always time for hugging, running after dogs and collecting old photographs.  Nevermind the volcano erupting. Even the effects aren't that good.  Model dams with tapwater just aren't as scary as real ones. Pierce Brosnan has kept his James Bondish skill of always being able to get out of a though situation and is most likely the toughest actionhero-geologist ever. This movie is a catastrophe!  I can't say it loud enough. Do not waste your time, see Volcano instead, it will provide what Dante's Peak falsely promises.  If you see both, you can see the clearest example I can think of how to and how not to make a movie about a volcano.

This movie had the worst plot ever, predictable to the last minute, and no good acting what-so-ever. Whoever wrote the script for this needs to be struck by lightning. This movie is action fodder. There's no romantic interaction for Rachel and Harry, the kids going up the mountain was the most friggin stupid thing I've ever seen done in a movie, and the kentucky fried grandma part was uncalled for. If you need to see a good action movie, count this out.Notes -Why can't the grandma survive and everyone else dies?

That is a cheap joke, but the movie sure wasn't cheap to make. Massive pyrotechnics, state of the art special effects, some of the biggest names in the movie business, all contribute to one big fat number to the production cost. It is a movie with such little intelligence and emotional significance it is hard to sit through the film's overly long running time without laughing at its stupidity. This is one of the worst films I have seen in quite sometime.	Instead of the story, lets skip right to the chase. How about starting with the flawed characters. Take for instance the grandmother, Ruth. Her character is all but a puppet of the plot. Ask yourself these questions and notice the answers are only present to place the other characters in more tension rising jeopardy Why would Ruth refuse to leave her cottage when the town is being destroyed by volcanic material? To provide the characters with a reason to travel up the mountain to save her and put themselves in more danger. Unfortunately, the film is so stupid it cant even capture a rescue correctly. Ruth's grandchildren (10-12 years old,) take their parents vehicle, drive through the volcanic soot, and somehow manage to find their way to the cottage, yet they cant turn on the windshield wipers in the car. And lets not forget to mention the two main characters, Harry Dalton and Rachel Wando, whose personalities are instantly obvious. We know who is going to die from the beginning just judging from difficulties in personalities.	This entire production is held together by pure foolishness. Just look at the film's extreme stupidity--here are a few examples of how dumb and or desperate the writers actually get ¬∑ Harry drives his truck directly through a moderately deep river due to an overcrowding of traffic, and makes it across with few difficulties.¬∑ The family's dog, Ruffy, disappears near the start of the volcanic eruption and somehow manages to appear out of nowhere for his heroic family rescue sequence. ¬∑ Harry and crew drive through a platform of molten lava.¬∑ The concept of the characters waiting till there's a river of red hot lava flowing through the living room of their cottage before they decide its time to run. 	Dante's Peak  is so bad it doesn't even offer any surprise when the volcano finally does blow its top. The film foreshadows the eruption with so many elements it is almost hard not to ask yourself why they even bothered with the production in the first place. Here are some examples of elements foreshadowing a Volcanic disaster ¬∑ First of all, why would anyone make a movie about a volcano about to erupt if it wasn't going to erupt in an all out action finale filed with special effects? ¬∑ Animals are dying everywhere on the mountain for unnatural reasons.¬∑ While swimming in the mountain's springs, two lovers are killed when the water dramatically heats up.¬∑ We see water boiling in the mountain.¬∑ The mountain shows strange activities while a man just so happens to be testing its activity levels.¬∑ Sulfur dioxide is found in the city's water supply.Now here is some dialogue foreshadowing the volcano's explosion¬∑ This mountain means business.¬∑ 98% of these are false alarms.¬∑ When is this mountain ready to blow. ¬∑ If the volcano did blow it would reach here within a minuteOf course the filmmakers couldn't resist but to throw in a romantic subplot. The following actions and or conversations all attempt to develop romantic chemistry between Brosnan and Hamilton¬∑ Harry's and Hamilton's characters sit down in the evening and nonchalantly discuss romance in their past.¬∑ The two take a peaceful walk together in the evening while one asks the other if they can stay longer.The special effects in this picture are also quite lame. The erupting volcano looks like a still photo of something out of national geographic. We do get to see buildings fall apart and fires start, but that isn't as exciting as the scene in which Harry outruns a cloud of volcanic smoke speeding towards him-not. This may be the worst disaster film ever made, but at lest it still contains decent performances.Brought to you by Universal Pictures. "}]
