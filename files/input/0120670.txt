Because of that, I didn't expect much.I was surprised. It's actually a good adventure story and Long was capable in his acting. He was aided by three fine actors who usually are interesting in whatever roles they play Scott Glenn, Suzy Amis and William Forstyhe. Glenn is the best-known of the three but had the least lines in here. Forsythe was good at playing what he does best the nasty villain.This movie was also well-filmed with some nice closeup and camera angles. The only complaints were some dopey dialog in spots and a little too much profanity in spots. Otherwise, for a no-name movie starring a rookie actor it was better than I anticipated.

Forsythe is great and you know you can always expect a show whenever his on screen, as he simply knows how to play devious tyrants. Also along for the heatwave are Scott Glenn and Barry Pepper. Simple-minded writing makes sure that the bubblegum action flows with the blatant heroics coming to the forefront, which is led by Long and Glenn. Hammy dialogues (I can't remember the last time I heard someone be called a butt-munch) are filtered in and the stunt-work can get hot and heavy. Too bad some of the computer effects come off rather lousy, especially during the final climatic scenes.

Disposable, but crackling entertainment. "},{"Title":"Firestorm Blows Smoke","Date":"20 August 2009","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller, Action","Review":" You cannot see the trees for the testosterone in director Dean Semler's synthetic outdoors action saga Firestorm, starring sportscaster Howie Long as a stalwart smoke jumper who parachutes into raging Wyoming forest fires to rescue little gals and grown-up gals from getting cremated. Any sparks that Howie ignited as an actor in John Woo's Broken Arrow sputter in Firestorm with Long's pulp diction performance. Chris Soth's one-dimensional script doesn't help Howie much as escaped convicts and flaming infernos challenge his physical prowess. There is nothing compelling about Howie's character and his charisma cannot compensate for this monolithic hero. Leanly plotted as a sapling but predictable as a plunging redwood, Firestorm kindles minimal excitement with its prefabricated plot and Howie's Styrofoam heroics. Of course, juvenile-minded audiences who don't demand much from their cinematic exercises may find this half-toasted tale tolerable.What modicum of merit the movie musters lies in its premise. Ultraviolent villain Randy Earl Shaye (William Forsythe of Once Upon A Time in America) cons his shyster lawyer (Terry Kelly of Christina) into committing wildfire arson. Shaye wants out of the Wyoming State Penitentiary to get his $20-million. It seems that the prison dispatches short-time convicts to help extinguish forest fires. Shaye plans to use the forest fire as a cover for his escape. Stabbing a friendly prisoner on the fire detail, Shaye disguises himself as the dead man, and then sneaks out of the joint. Soth asks us to believe that a man could escape from prison based largely on a tattoo worn behind the ear.As villains go, Shaye shows early promise as a worthy adversary, until the filmmakers contrive obvious flaws in his character that assure his mortality. Veteran heavy William Forsythe supplies appropriate plug-ugly menace as Randy Earl Shaye. When we initially see Shaye, he resembles Sean Connery from the The Rock, with a beard and blond messianic coiffure. The filmmakers emphasize Shaye's villainy by showing not only the character of Shaye but also Forsythe's sneering face together in the same shot with the man that he kills. Driving the point home, director Dean Semler wants audiences to realize that Shaye is clearly an unrepentant sadist. Sadly, the events of the plot turn more on Shaye's sadism than on his criminal ingenuity. Shaye's comeuppance is horribly graphic but richly deserved for his murderous demeanor.Firestorm follows clench-jawed Jesse Graves (ex-Raiders football star Howie Long) as he thwarts Shaye's escape. The Spartan Chris Soth screenplay tosses in a woman to liven things up. Titanic supporting player Suzy Amis appears here as Jennifer, an ornithologist who finds herself trapped by the wildfire blaze. Fleeing from the fire, she runs smack into Randy Earl and his armed and stupid henchmen masquerading as Canadian firefighters. You must have stupid henchmen in Firestorm so that they can brag about their means of escape. When Jennifer finally gets away, Shaye cannot afford to let her live because she knows his plans.Meanwhile, when Jesse learns about the forest fire, he skydives into it singlehandedly. He stumbles into Shaye, Jennifer and Shaye's other henchmen. In other words, Firestorm constantly moves ahead in terms of storytelling, but with little efficiency, plausibility, or imagination. When Shaye tries his bogus Canadian firefighters story out, Jesse is neither impressed nor convinced. Matching fists and wits with Shaye's motley crew, our brawny firefighter hero sneaks off with Jennifer and they evade Randy Earl until a climactic fight on a lake about to be engulfed in a withering blaze.Firestorm derives its title from the phenomenon which occurs when two fires collide and suck all of the oxygen out of the air, creating one of Mother Nature's nasty nuclear-style blasts which destroys everything in it. Soth's script contains those suitable elements that any decent he-man actioneer should boast. The effect, however, is less than incendiary. The problem with Soth along with uncredited scenarist Graham Yost of Speed and Hard Target is that their characters are a poorly developed bundle of stick figures with neither depth nor complexity. Randy Earl Shaye is supposed to be a homicidal genius who goes so far as to impersonate a prisoner (brutally killing the convict by stabbing him in the neck), but doesn't know squat about forest fires. Jennifer claims to be the offspring of a third generation Marine. Boasting that she can field strip automatic weapons like an AK-47, she fails to notice that the auto-pistol that she swiped from a sex offender isn't loaded.Firestorm does other things wrong, too. A neat gimmick--ping-pong balls that explode to start fires&#x97;is lamely utilized. The first time that they use it as a trick during a ping-pong game, and the second time, Howie uses it to start a backfire to divert oxygen from the first fire. But the ping-pong balls disappear afterward, never to be used again. There is a running joke about axes that the filmmakers bungle, too. At one point in the plot, Jesse and Jennifer lay a trap for Shaye and his sex-predator henchmen that goes afoul because it is so ineptly planned with half-baked results! The only surprises in Firestorm are provided by rugged Scott Glenn as battle-weary smoke jumper Wynt Perkins who is crippled while rescuing a dog from a burning house. Revealing more about his role and character would cut down on what little energy Firestorm contrives. Sentimentality drips off the script at points, especially at the end when Jennifer learns that she has been incubating two bird eggs during this maelstrom of action.Dances with Wolves Oscar-winning photographer Dean Semler makes his less than inflammatory directorial debut with Firestorm. When he takes his cameras up for aerial shots of British Columbia, you find your breath catching in your throat. Sadly, Semler doesn't breath the same magic into the thin, adolescent storyline. The special effects of the firestorm aren't that imaginative. You feel like you're trapped by expensive looking computer graphics instead of a real wildfire.

Forsythe tries really hard to be the scummiest villain ever - sort of a combo Lecter and a Malkovich villain - and, in some ways, he succeeds. But, by the end, you wonder, why was he trying so hard?

Well, my friends and I came out of the theater in tears.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Right up there with The Big Hit (Which was also really funny), and Armageddon. Howie Long was terrible.  The probability of the stunts and action was even worse, and the fact that someone actually thought up this movie was the worst of all.  And oh, it was really funny how Long pulled a RUNNING CHAINSAW out of his butt.  Plus, I was amazed how he could throw it through someone's windshield and then fly off a cliff with no parachute but then...had a parachute!  The best actor in the movie was the axe.  This is filmmaker's fecal matter.

He takes a hostage and promises fellow cohorts a share of a large stash that he hid sometime ago. It is up to smokejumper Jesse Graves to save the hostage and stop the villain.The premise is unbelievably hokey, but it still manages to fall short of the plots hokeyness. The movie is just some loosely connected action scenes that are made with unimpressive staging and mediocre special effects. From the first super cheesy scene the acting is virtually non-existent, except for William Forysthe who manages to entertain with his super-evil and calculating villain persona. But still, he can't make something out of nothing.Nothing is an apt way to put it since this is really a film about just that. There is little mention of plot, little mention of the smokejumpers' techniques, little mention of the science of fire, but there is lots of fire. LOTS AND LOTS OF FIRE. But fire is just fire. It can't make a movie by itself.Re-watch Twister for a relatively plot-less disaster/action movie done right. Or if fire is your thing Backdraft or Ladder 49 will do. Just avoid this. --- 2/10Rated R for violence "},{"Title":"Not even a real movie","Date":"24 June 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller, Action","Review":" Although nowhere as infamous as John Travolta's Battlefield Earth or Warren Beatty's Ishtar or George Lucas's Howard the Duck, this sorry excuse for a movie is equal in unintentional humor. Some of the worst computer graphics ever seen, a performance so wooden from Howie Long it makes Stallone look like Ben Kingsley, and scenes that are so unrealistic Ed Wood would not have filmed them. One scene, the Fire Storm scene, shows raging computer graphic flames rushing over mountains like a gigantic burning tornado, covering hundreds of square miles in three seconds flat. Everyone in the theater was laughing, except maybe for the smart ones who had already walked out.The director went on to make one of the more forgettable Steven Seagal straight-to-video movies, and the writer was never heard from again. And poor Suzi Amis; You'd think James Cameron might have helped his gal get better movie roles.

Long stars as a fire-fighter in the forest who believes that some fellow fire-fighters are trapped in the wilderness, but really it is just an elaborate trick by some escaped convicts led by William Forsythe. Now Long must take the bad guys with the typical violent and empty results. Long really had a good role in Broken Arrow as John Travolta's evil henchman, but given more air time means Long excels even less on the big screen. 2 stars out of 5.

Especially coupled with diabolically smart prison break by one of the most ruthless and ingenious criminals in history. Add into the mix fearless smoke-jumper, his wise mentor, who wants to retire, and beautiful woman-ornithologist, caught in the fire; spice it up with hidden loot, use majestic mountain nature as a background, and the movie can't fail, can it?It can. Firestorm is a complete disaster - both artistic and commercial. Film's short running time indicates that it had been considerably trimmed during editing. Maybe pic's makers accidentally cut out the most essential sequences? Because nothing makes sense in the final version. All the characters take illogical decisions to move the plot forward; plot twists are sketched out but never fully developped; and this movie can win competition in density of stupid lines on a square meter of film category. While Firestorm boasts fine supporting cast, the main hero is irrevocably dumb and unsympathetic. Why on hell studio took Howie Long as leading man in the film, where Scott Glenn, Susy Amis and William Forsythe all play second fiddle, is not quite clear, but hopefully nobody will make the same mistake twice. Cinematographer-turned-director Dean Semler courageously fights silly script and mr. Long who looks like parody on superhero. Other thesps try to help the director in his hopeless task and they almost succeed Forsythe is suitably creepy as the main baddie, Amis is suitably spunky and Glenn is suitably valiant and virile. But they can't save the day, because only super-genius of a director could overcome overall stupidity of the project; and Semler is no Jan De Bont.

Howie Long should be promoted to Master Actor. He is so good at expressing his emotions. He should teach a class about emotions at a major college. A major college about human emotions. He is a vortex, that drags all of his surrounding actors and co-workers into his world. The drama in this movie is incredible as well. The whole firestorm element pulls you to the edge of your seat and then drops you on your face. I wish I could throw an axe like Howie Long. When the escaped convicts pretended to be Canadian, I wasn't sure whether they were Canadian or American. And when the Bird watcher stated how she had Marine training, I could see how perfect a match those two little love birds were. I really love how the whole plot was summarized in about 10 minutes during the entire feature, this allowed for more Howie Long content. This was an incredible movie. I would recommend it to anyone. Except to pregnant women. This movie has a few side effects such as premature birth, diarrhea, and drilling your eyes out with a jackhammer. I would also recommend Fire Down Below (Steven Seagal). If I could make one wish for anything in the whole world, it would be for Howie Long to restart(or start) his film career.

It is almost like someone took Cheesey Movie Making 101. The casting is surprisingly good, the acting itself isn't bad, but script is humorously appalling and the characters are incredibly predictable and shallow. We actually had a very good time predicting characters' next lines with an amusing amount of success. The opening scene is hilarious (small dog included, I kid you not). Speaking as someone who has worked in the wildland fire the movie is completely unrealistic, particularly the beginning and end, the movie has nice symmetry that way. (To name a few errors, you light a backfire to eliminate the fuels-not the oxygen, we do not fly aircraft at night, and, trust me on this one, EVERYONE wears sunglasses.) This is actually quite successful as a satire on action films. Unfortunately for the film makers, I don't think that is what was intended.

He organizes his escape putting fire in the forest and working as a fireman volunteer in the prison. After some crimes and betrayals, he and three other bandits try to escape through the forest, where they meet the ornithologist Jennifer  (Suzy Amis). Pretending they are firemen, they bring Jennifer with them as an `insurance policy'. Meanwhile, Jesse is in the forest trying to rescue them. This is another average and full of clichés action movie. William Forsythe acts well as a sadistic criminal, but most of the plot is so ridiculous that makes laugh. Situations like Jennifer trading the position with Jesse on the motorcycle, or Jennifer putting Jesse's knee in the right position, or Randall with an axe in the neck in one scene and fighting in the next one. What about capsize a boat like Jesse does? Therefore, a forgettable action movie. My vote is five.

What`s wrong with that ? Nothing , except that the firestorm would have suffocated the trio by using up all the surrounding oxygen . The makers could have been forgiven for including this factual error by doing it the once , but screw up by drawing attention to it a second time during the climax where the hero correctly states the firestorm will use up all the oxygen outside the boat . So much for internal continuity .Maybe I shouldn`t be so harsh because FIRESTORM isn`t a film that`s supposed to make you think . It`s one of those dumb Summer blockbusters that concentrates on spectacle and FX rather than logic , fact or characterisation and I`m slightly surprised that it didn`t do better since I never knew it existed  untill I saw it on TV last night . It`s slightly similar to being a cross between TWISTER and CLIFFHANGER and is fairly enjoyable in a dumb blockbuster way , but I would have enjoyed it more if the criminals on the bus got fried . That`s the problem with these type of films - The hero saves everyone  "}]
