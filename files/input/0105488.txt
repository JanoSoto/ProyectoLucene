The EDITING is superb. All too often we focus on the actors, music, or cinematography.  This is natural, and in this film all of these are superb. But keep a close watch of the editing - wow, it is perfect and ties the whole film together flawlessly. There are so many cuts that make the perspective magical.(And no, I am not a film editor.)2.  Look at WHO is dancing together as couples, right at the end.  This, like so many other fine details, carries lots of significance.3.  When Scott and Fran are practising on the deck at her house, under the instruction of her family, her Spanish father dances with her and says Muy bien, muy bien, Fran. Very good!  Notice that he uses her Anglo name Fran rather than her Spanish name, and converts over to English. The look he gives her tells us that he is probably seeing his (deceased) wife, via his daughter whom he loves, and that he finally ACCEPTS her and her Anglo boyfriend. This is but one of many small scenes that have more depth than may be first apparent.My wife and I grabbed this video to 'fill in time' during a quiet weekend. We were astounded at how it captivated us since we had already seen it when it first came out.

Never seen a movie with that much rich choreography before. That's Baz Luhrmann, who is an expert at swinging a visual feast; and Strictly Ballroom is his red curtain trio opening(together with Romeo+Juliet and Moulin Rouge!). With his own style of cinematography and overdrive speed of camera work, it's impossible to watch a 94 minutes film in exact 94 minutes. Otherwise you'd be falling into anxiety saying to yourself Ooops! Did i just miss a scene? I still rewind on many scenes each time I watch Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge! Here are some unforgettable and timelessly cult scenes and moments I most like 1- Scott&Francesca dancing in front of the Coca Cola broad sheet at the roof 2- Scott&Francesca dancing with Doris Day's Perhaps,Perhaps, Perhaps(1954 version) behind the red curtain 3- Francesca and Scott's meeting scene and the way she introducing herself to Scott 4- Scott practicing his style of dance and watching himself by the mirror 5- Scott's father starting clapping in unison when Scott&Francesca turned back to the stage where they are banned 6- Francesca persuading Scott upon the choices they look forward to make beside the wire fences they walk through in the nightStrictly Ballroom is one of the best choices to watch and enjoy it with your beloved. It will keep you locked in a close embrace. It is also the best choice to start learning couples' dancing. But, if you're looking for some silver screen accomplishment, which I mostly do for every movie I watched, there is only the noteworthy achievement of costume design. Directing-editing-screenplay are collaboratively proper since it is Baz Luhrmann's own project. I only disliked the sound editing.

I relate to the ugly duckling storyline, and also enjoy the attractive male star! There are characters you love to hate and those who step up when you didn't think they would. The flashbacks are very quirky/funny. I'm sure in Australia this ballroom dancing stuff is taken deadly seriously, so Luhrman probably took a hit for lampooning it the way he does.

The attention to detail in the direction is fantastic, each scene is done with glistening sense of bewilderment and beauty. The acting is very plausible and energetic, the dance is done with with verve and style. The music fits in well within the story. From the beginning it's all very heart warming, but the end scene gave me tingles up and down my arm. It's an enjoyable film, but at times you wonder whether your feeling bewildered, entertained or thrilled.What ever you feel for this film, you cannot put it down for the stylised direction, and the extravagant behaviour of the characters. See if you like Moulin Rouge, Dirty dancing or Romeo and Juliet.*original review written by me at 15, re-written at 22*Of all the reviews I wrote in my teens this has to be my favourite, namely because I still whole-heartedly love this film. I called it cheesy, but I'm retracting this its not cheesy, its flamboyant and its flamboyant in the best possible way. Strictly Ballroom will alienate some with how over-the-top the whole thing is, but there is no denying that this makes it all the more engaging. Like a fantasy film, it manages to take you to a new world. It takes you to a place only film and(to lesser extent)stage can take you. Strictly Ballroom gives you a window to look through, a world of dance and instead of tentatively peering through it, forces you right up against it, where a sea of multicoloured dresses and sequins lie. Strictly Ballroom is a all hands on deck movie that will either leave you wide-eyed and bewildered or alienated and scared. But whatever it ends up leaving you, I would highly recommend watching if you have not already seen it. And this is coming from me 7 years later, as an adult, a film-making student and someone who isn't usually a fan of this kind of film.

I had no inkling what the film was about because it was a friend's pick, and for the first 20 minutes I wondered what was going on and would have considered walking out if it weren't for my friends. Shortly it became VERY clear it was a satire and was poking fun at the whole ballroom dancing 'phenomenon'. The exaggerations were very funny, and in addition you had the ugly duckling theme and romance between an unlikely couple. ** SPOILER&#133;.. My favorite scene and one I consider to be one of the best examples of film chemistry is the sexy but subtle dance scene when Fran and Scott are dancing behind the curtain while the dance competitors do a parody out on the floor. ** I feel really sorry for the people that don't seem to get it- there were several reviewers who didn't seem to understand the fact that this is a satire.

Close scrutiny reveals two major flaws, however.  The character of Fran (Tara Morice) is much too ugly duckling at the beginning of the film; no one as intelligent and self-aware as she is could remain so clumsy and plain into adulthood.  I can buy the blossoming of self-esteem through love, but there's only so much love can do.  The other problem is larger  the revolutionary dancing Scott and Fran are doing is virtually indistinguishable from the staid, boring styles they are supposedly rebelling against.  It looks better because of how the director and editor presented it, but there is little if any qualitative difference.  That said, the film is well worth a look, with guaranteed laughs, excitement, and an interesting soundtrack.

And some people to root for and to hiss against--you know, heroes and villains.It could have been tightened up, no doubt--there are times when I was a little impatient even though they were dancing away. But mostly I was happy to watch and wait for the next step toward the big climax.The two young leads, interestingly, came from nowhere (the perfectly named Paul Mercurio and the understated Tara Morice both in their first films). They've gone on to largely television careers, and in part you appreciate how much Luhmann gets from them. The highly stylized approach helps avoid a need for real acting, per se, but Mercurio in particular really rises to the occasion. The whole affair is Australian, and it feels bright and original the way some of fellow Aussie Peter Weir's films do, or in another sense, Peter Jackson.If you can summon up any innocence and romance and go for what really clicks here, be swept up and love it.

Scott Hastings had already danced a great Viennese waltz with former partner Liz Holt, and then, as the scene shifts to samba, Scott Hastings starts out great with Liz, and then, in the middle of the samba version of Tequila in the background, Scott explodes and does his overkill-laden solo trick steps way beyond what Liz could follow. Les Kendall, Scott's dance coach, explains the reason why Scott wanted to free himself--in the start of the samba, Les said that he was boxed-in by Ken Rallings and Tina Sparkles, which caused Scott to release a freedom type of dancing anger. Liz tries to keep up with Scott's unacceptable solo dance showmanship but then, Australian Dance Council chairman, Barry Fife, penalizes that couple major points causing Ken and Tina to win the Waratah title. Liz then finally cuts off her dance partnership with Scott after the competition at the next scene in the Kendall Dance Studio.Then, a new beginning dance partner, Fran, accosts Scott at the studio and make a ruse to be new partners and practice their routine in light of the upcoming Pan-Pacific Dance Championships. Fran's flamenco dance ability is given away a bit when she demonstrates a short tap sequence. Learning from the dancesport debacle in Waratah, Scott is still stubborn and decides to strongly bend the dancesport rules with new steps for the Pan-Pacific championships to try to impress Barry Fife. Barry is not happy about it and decides that Scott's new steps will never, ever be in the books in competition as long as Fife remains in power in Australian dancesport.In the middle of the movie, Tina Sparkle decides to retire from her partnership from Ken Railings, doing their final honor dance at a pre- competition social ballroom dance party, while at the same time, Scott and Fran, do a theatrical dance in quasi-silhouette to Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps. This is where the disapproval of their partnership increases. Les Kendall now warns Scott that if you dance with Fran, you will never win the Pan-Pacific competition, but then suggests to Scott that if you partner up with Tina, you will have a 100 percent shot of winning the Pan-Pacific title.But then, Fran and Scott are caught by Fran's flamenco music family, forcing them to dance a paso doble, and then, eventually, Fran's father then teaches him the authentic Spanish paso doble. The solo focusing of the paso is the beginning of the recipe for almost total disaster on the start of the Pan-Pacific championships. In the appetizer paso doble heat in the competition floor, Fran does dance with an unknown lady, and then, as Scott arrives to face the forced partnering of Tina Sparkles with him for the Latin championship round, Scott decides at the last minute to dance with Fran in the second paso doble around with several professional Latin dance couples dancing. Barry Fife, already there, catches Fran and Scott in the action and orders the music powered down, and disqualifies both dancers for good. Fran and Scott, however, refuses to leave the floor and instead, with the help of Fran's family, dance a spectacular Spanish flamenco dance with strong paso feel, shocking the audience, and even Barry Fife himself. In the end, the audience comes out to the dance floor to get their chance to dance, and the guess is that even if disqualified--you can shock a crowd if you do a great unique dance, and that's what Fran and Scott did. They won their hearts, even if it is not a championship trophy!

It is the first movie of his trilogy The Red Curtain.Strictly Ballroom is, in few words, the story of a ugly dancing duckling who finds her break-the-rules swan dancer. It is the story of Scott, a brilliant ballroom dancer trained in a prestigious dancing school since his childhood, who is to become the next Pan-Pacific champion if he follows traditional ballroom style and moves. However, he has a spirit of his own, a dancing creativity that he's trying to channel and express in front of the public. In his way to become himself as a dancer, he pairs -not previous begging and hard work- with beginner dancer Fran, a shy Spanish girl from a family of flamenco dancers.The movie has a predictable unoriginal story and stereotypical characters, but the script is light and funny, engaging and fresh, and a little bit Kitch but in a charming way. The musical numbers are danced with talent and great heart, and they are very enjoyable. I especially liked the funny retro images telling the story of Scott's dancing parents through dance, which are truly creative, theatrical, and delightful.To me, this is Baz Luhrman's most Australian movie, despite not pretending to be so. Definitely more Australian than his movie Australia, but much less pretentious and with much more heart. The movie presents a mix of true Australian characters, Anglosaxons and immigrants (in this case Spaniards), passionate people about competition and sports, always giving their best to win anything - hard working dreamers. Moreover, the characters and the story have a very Australian sense of humor, and the characters speak with a marked Australian strong accent, especially clear in Cariades' character. In fact, the characters and atmosphere somewhat reminded me of those unforgettable ones in the Australian film The Castle.Overall, the performances are very good. Paul Mercurio and Tana Merice are convincing and good in their acting and dancing. Paul Mercurio is really great in his dancing. All the supporting actors are terrific and nail their characters Pat Thomson (who died before the movie was premiered) as Scott's mother Shirley, Barry Otto as Scott's father Doug, Gia Carides as Scott's first dancing partner Liz, Bill Hunter as the President of the Ballroom Australian Federation, and Peter Whitford as the owner and director of Les Kendall's Dance Academy.

Seriously, this is a delightful spoof which is drawn from the real life competitive world of ballroom dancing. We all wish fairy tales like this happened in real life; alas, they rarely do.I love the fact that they didn't take a gorgeous girl for the female lead and just show her without makeup and with a bad hairdo in the beginning in order to make her a wallflower or Plain Jane. This never fools anyone and it is what most Hollywood movies do like Princess Diaries for example. In this film the female lead really IS kind of a Plain Jane--she just learns to make the most of her assets.Paul Mercurio is wonderful in the male romantic lead, too bad he has not been in more films that I could see. The actors playing his parents are over the top, but convincing as people who carry sadness and frustration. They also have moments when they crack us up......I suppose this will appeal to women more than men, except gay men should love it. Straight men who don't give it a try are really missing out....it's funny and touching.

I was lulled into a sense of reality about the sets while enjoying the outrageous characters that are reminiscent of an old time silent movie. But then I realized that the sets and scenes were amazingly beautiful, well designed and thought out. At one point, I thought that the frame could easily hang on my wall as a picture. I haven't been that impressed since Kurasawa's Ran.This is a brilliantly artistic film. Kudos to Martin Brown and Steve Mason for art and cinematography. Obviously, the costumes are beautiful, but it's even funny how the makeup team managed to capture the correct style for the dancers and, in at least one instance, the impression of bad 80's makeup that was just part of the character.

This wonderful concoction of glitz,pomade,eyeshadow and dyed hair (and that's just the blokes)is the archetypal feelgood movie.Almost in passing it also contains one of the Great Moments of The Cinema,near the end where Scott Mercurio,freed at last from his obligation to his parents to keep to the orthodox forms of dancing,his gold matador's jacket glittering under the backlighting,slides on his knees across the Ballroom floor as the camera tracks alongside him,his face a study in barely controlled passion.This I guarantee will raise the hair on the back of your neck.He is a young man driven by his parents' ambition for him to win the Pan Pacific Ballroom Dancing Championship to compensate for their failure to do so 25 years previously.This obsession has turned him into a vain selfish and blinkered individual with little regard for the feelings of others.Philip Larkin - take a bow.Tanya Morice glows with inner beauty as the Hispanic girl who redeems the hero.She is the much - loved child of a close - knit family proud of their Southern European culture of music and dancing. They live in somewhat reduced circumstances literally on the wrong side of the railway tracks.Freight trains rumble past as she and Mercurio are taught the secrets of the paso doble by her father and grandmother. The plot and its resolution are cosy and familiar from as far back as The Jazz Singer,but Strictly Ballroom is a beautifully realised affectionate study of human vanity,frailty and folly.It is well - observed and very funny,breathless and optimistic.Only the truly cold - hearted will resist it.

Strictly Ballroom is a Cult film.If you like the story of Cinderella, then you will like this movie. If you like a rye (English) sense of humor, then you must see this film. If you love dancing, you are at the right place. In the beginning, I really disliked this film, reason The colors are garish, and the make-up cannot be more ugly! And I was confused as to why this was. So, I spent the first viewing of this film in confusion. Where was the beauty? I am a photographer; I wanted to see harmony of colors. No color harmony here. But it had this great dancing; and a great ending. And I am a ballroom dancer. And I believe in romance. And so, I stayed and viewed it again. I just didn't get it all the first time. I asked why? (...and this is one of the lines in the movie!) This film highlights all that is bad about ballroom dancing. And the result? A funny, hilarious, riot of a romp. However, here are serious scenes, tender scenes, passionate scenes which cause us to reflect on our own lives and perhaps past loves. It makes fun of institutions and pompous behavior.There is no sex, violence, or bad words in this film. There is passion, kookiness, and beautiful dancing Viennese Waltz, Cha Cha, Samba, Paso Doble, Flamenco. Religious people will not be offended at any time; but one dancer has a skimpy dress on herself.This movie is for those who believe in romance in that old fashioned way. This movie is for those who don't kiss on the first date, or the second date. This movie is for those who love the value of outer beauty, but know that inner beauty is richly valuable. Conquer your fears. Be individual. The Individual vs. The Establishment. Believe in the value of the old country ways and passions and traditions. A life lived in fear is a life half-lived Because this movie is camp, a satire, set with extraordinarily garish and contrasting colors, it is easy to be distracted to the, well, ugly sets. You will immediately cringe at the look of the film in the first few minutes. Purple is mixed with coral red mixed with pink and orange and chartreuse. It will be hard to like this movie in the first 30 minutes or so. You will be recoiling from the colors of the set. But stay with it...this film is a pearl being formed in an oyster. Great ballroom dancing! And this movie has substance, especially if you believe in romance and caring and the usefulness of courage to accomplish your goals.Since 99% of all people are not ballroom dancers, you will immediately have problems trying to understand this sub-culture of ballroom dancers. Then you will wonder if all ballroom dancers are like this, and what does it all mean? How are ballroom competitions organized? You HAVE SOMETHING TO LEARN HERE. And this will DISTRACT YOUR ENJOYMENT for the first 1-2 viewings of this movie. Only until the end will you understand why you were lead on this journey through a fantastical world of BALLROOM CONFLICT. Then you will view it a second time; and more will be revealed to you as you decide the motivations of each actor. Why is the ballroom competition so important to each individual person you will ask yourself. Upon your 5th viewing, you will still be finding more details to be amazed at. And these details have much to do with the delivery of the lines of the actors. You will likely start memorizing these lines for your own enjoyment. Perhaps I could call this film the Rocky Horror Show of dance movies.You will be laughing more and more the more times you view this movie. It's outrageous! Outlandish! Over-the-top! And it's all spoken in an Australian accent which makes it all the more out-there or should I saw under-there? Be prepared for a cultural shock; you are about to enter a sub-society of people with really kooky behavior. And at the end, YOU WILL CRY! Notice who is dancing with whom at the end; this is also very important.I have seen Strictly Ballroom 42 times. This movie is one of my all time favorite movies no matter what the genre. And I could see this movie another 42 times.You just might become a new ballroom dancer after viewing it!

I really fell in love with this film when I first saw it, just as I'm sure others do when they really strike gold with a film. So for sentimental reasons, this one might forever be my top favourite. Something about the the dancing, vibrant colours, over-the-topness really excited me (and still does). Usually my two favourite ingredients in a film are romance and comedy (dancing is a bonus) and I feel this film has those in spades, but at the same time it has a message running through it that really speaks out to me--I often feel very drawn to films about being free-spirited and non-conforming. One of the elements of the film that really speaks to me (and did from my very first viewing) is the music--some of it recurs through the film (like the poignant theme associated with Doug) while others are isolated in one scene (like Doris Day's rendition of Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps which Scott and Fran dance to). The music brings out all kinds of emotions - pure elation, excitement, poignancy. There is then of course the dancing, which perhaps really anchors the film for me. The two dances between Scott and Fran are both wonderful. The Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps rumba is simple, beautiful and romantic, with Scott and Fran blissfully unaware of anything other than each other. Then their second dance at the Pan Pacifics is glorious and by the end of it, has the crowd rooting for them. The film's ending is nothing short of joyous, wrapping up well what is an entertaining and engaging hour and a half. ---original review---If upbeat movies with lots of rhythm suit you, then this will too!This movie is a Baz Luhrmann classic. I've watched it so many times it's hard to count. It has just the right amounts of hum our and romance as well as having a great storyline. I suggest you check it out and see it for yourself because you won't truly understand how great it was until you've watched it. You may not be a big fan of dancing, but this movie will inspire you. There is never a dull moment from start to finish. The acting is also impressive and showcases the talent of Australians. After watching all three Baz Luhrmann movies, I must say his movies are my favourite. Finally, if you don't like it I'd like to know why.

But the film opens documentary-style, with ballroom queen Pat Thompson so distraught over son Paul Mercurio's improvisational dance steps she actually breaks down in sobs saying, I keep asking myself why? Where did I go wrong as a mother?!! I've never laughed so hard five minutes into a movie in my life. From that moment on the film is a marvelous, over-the-top tribute to the business of professional ballroom dancing (a form of entertainment I admit I was only aware of from the annual PBS specials hosted by Ron Montez and the late Juliet Prowse). But director Baz Luhrmann (whom I think went a bit too MTV for the film 'Moulin Rouge') gets the balance of comedy and Hollywood musical spoof just right here. The film goes from mock-docudrama to a charming, hotheaded-boy-meets-shy-awkward-girl story flawlessly, and even though there are cliches' throughout the film (awkward girl is ostracized by society for no apparent reason; all accomplished dancers seem to be sprayed with a layer of tanning lacquer and gunite), the film nips each one of them in the bud quickly, and you end up not minding the swan-like transformation of leading lady Tara Morice (you can see it coming in the rehearsal sequence when she first displays a leotard and skirt; the hair comes down, and the glasses come off).

(Not being racist or anything, but the US didn't take too kindly to his latest) Then I realised, I've never commented on Strictly Ballroom, so I decided tonight would be the night!The film is about Scott, a young Australian ballroom dancer. One night at a dancing competition, he tries a few new moves out. His partner is furious, and so she leaves him, after she is informed that another, better dancer, Ken Railings, has lost his partner. She's broken both her legs.  (Make sure you see that part, it's hilarious.) Scott's parents, who own the local ballroom dancing school, decide to look for another partner for him, as the Pan Pacifics (massive dancing competition) are coming up, and Scott absolutely has to win! A young, quite unattractive amateur, Fran, walks in on Scott practising his moves in one of the rooms in the school and we can tell she instantly falls in love with this talented young man. He notices her after a while, and he decided he will train Fran, secretly, and she will be his dancing partner for the Pan Pacifics.       There are some hilarious moments in this Australian love story brilliantly directed by the one and only Baz Luhrmann.

I watched it eight times in six days.This is an amazing film. It evokes such incredible feelings in me, and I appreciate it on so many levels as a dance student, as a film student, and as a human being.When I was eleven I never realised how electrifying the chemistry is between Mercurio and Morice. The scene where they dance behind the curtain at the state championships gives me goosebumps; my tape is probably already wearing thin in that section! And the climactic ending is wonderful; verging on cliche, but that is what makes it so uplifting.The characters are perfectly fleshed out and believable in an unbelievable way, and the comedic angle is played to perfection. My mother watched it with me on one of my repeated viewings and said, Oh, I forgot how funny this film was!. I agreed wholeheartedly.Also, another highlight is the amazing editing. Different scenes and shots are bound to each other seamlessly, and even the occasional montage of speedier cuts are not too noticeable or too imposing, as they suit the action on screen so well.This is a magical film with a simple but beautiful message.

The inspired mockumentary opening introduces us to our restless hero (Mercurio, an accomplished real-life dancer), who scandalizes everyone by daring to improvise in a samba competition.  Joining him on his quest to introduce new moves into the ballroom formula is an unlikely heroine, ugly duckling Morice, who follows classic film tradition by transforming into a swan after she convinces Mercurio to take her on as a partner.  Surprisingly, though, she has a few things to teach him about dancing--and about having the courage to follow your dreams.Everything about this film is expertly executed--the costumes, dialogue, choreography, and especially the casting.  Mercurio and Morice, excellent as they are, are almost upstaged at times by a marvelous supporting cast. Their journey culminates in a heady, thrilling paso doble that reaffirms the value of individualism in a jaded world, and reminds us what dancing is really all about.  Filled with laugh-out-loud humor, old-fashioned romance, a giddy flashback sequence, and stirring dance numbers, this movie is guaranteed to lift your spirits and make you feel like dancing.

This romantic comedy stars Paul Mercurio as Scott Hastings, Tara Morice as Fran, Bill Hunter as Barry Fife, Pat Thompson as Shirley Hastings and Gia Carides as Liz Holt. Strictly Ballroom is about Scott Hastings, a champion ballroom dancer, who, much to the annoyance of his parents, partner and judges, believes in dancing his own steps. Fran is a beginner dancer and is a bit of an ugly duckling who really wants to dance with Scott. Together these two misfits set out to win the Pan Pacific Championships.Strictly Ballroom is a great movie. It was humorous, as well as dramatic. The love story was great but luckily, not too in-depth. The visuals are colourful and beautiful and the dancing is great to watch. Baz's directing style is incredible. He really knows how to catch an audience's eye with stunning costumes and dances. The other great thing is that even though the movie is only about 90 mins long, he still manages to captivate us with his directing and visuals. The acting was also quite good.

This is a gorgeous, glorious film, shot through with Luhrmann's incredible visual flair, and grand cinematic technique. The scenes glide eloquently into one another at such a pace, and the camera swoops onto the dancefloor as a third partner that you wonder where the time went. It's not only a whimsical, off-kilter love story, but also very very funny, and although he is just as guilty of the crowd-pleasing moves as his characters, and the basic story has been told a million times before, you can't fail to be won over by the exuberance and theatricality which is now a trademark of this most unconventional of directors.There are the seeds of Moulin Rouge! sown throughout Strictly Ballroom, but the latter has more truth, beauty, freedom, and love...plus passion in abundance.

Every single frame of this film is quintessentially Australian from the warped and macabre sense of humour to the thick accents all of the characters use. Showing that you don't need the acid-trip stylistic smoke and mirrors of an MTV video to make a statement, Luhrmann relies here solely on the chemistry that exists between his two lead characters, Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice. The silhouetted tango scene between the two of them while Doris Day serenades them with Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps is the most elegant dance sequence since Fred Astaire proclaimed to Ginger Rogers that he was Never Gonna Dance again in Swingtime.

I imagine all the cartoon sound effects (since found in Romeo and Moulin) were her idea as well. This film is to production design as Scott's steps are to ballroom dancing enough within the parameters to not be outside what we accept as film reality. But at the same time, outside the convention enough to please us with the flash.The train scene was effective. Very impressive. The Coke sign as well.

The film gets off to a very promising start with humorous character interviews inserted in and around the protagonist's first attempt to impress a panel of judges by dancing his own style at the last minute; the glittery ballroom costumes are also impressive right from the very first scene. As the film progresses though, any initial zany humour soon dissipates, and while kooky touches can still be found (comical extreme close-up shots), the story gradually settles into a rather conventional story of overcoming the odds. The young dancer also gets a new ballroom partner who is a bit too much of a classical underdog. She is a dowdy immigrant with less than perfect skin and thick glasses, but it is of course nothing that a makeover cannot fix as she soon becomes a good-looking star. To the film's credit though, it is never once boring even when the story sags. The choreography is often spectacular, the film rocks to an excellent sourced song soundtrack, and the supporting cast give it all they have got, especially Bill Hunter - best remembered as the title character's father in 'Muriel's Wedding'. Those deterred by Luhrmann's flashiness in his better known films may also be impressed with how restrained his directing hand here is, while at the same time there is enough razzle-dazzle to appease those who love that sort of thing.

Strictly Ballroom can be seen as part of a New New Wave concentrating more on a modern urban Australia.This was the first film to be directed by Baz Luhrmann and started life as a stage play written by Luhrmann himself some years earlier. The story is set (as the title might suggest) in the world of competitive ballroom dancing. Scott Hastings, a young dancer, has caused some controversy within the sport by adopting a style of dancing which is not strictly ballroom in that it uses steps and moves not approved by the rule-book. Hence the title. The film has bequeathed its initial adverb to the BBC's pro-celebrity ballroom dancing contest, Strictly Come Dancing, even though in that particular context it looks rather ungrammatical. Scott has upset not only the judges and the sport's governing authorities, but also his dancing partner Liz, who leaves him for a rival, and even his parents Doug and Shirley, themselves noted ballroom dancers in their youth. Undeterred, Scott finds a new partner, Fran, and with her begins preparing for a major championship. Given that competitive ballroom dancing is, after all, a sport with its own rules, Scott's stance struck me as rather futile, the equivalent of a rugby team entering a football tournament and then complaining that they were only allowed to field eleven players, not fifteen, and that they had to play with a round ball, not an oval one. Luhrmann, however, obviously invites us to side with Scott and to regard his disregard of the rules as an admirable stand on behalf of individuality against conformism.The film forms part of what has become known as Luhrmann's Red Curtain Trilogy, the other two parts being Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet. Despite being designated as a trilogy the three films do not have any characters or plot elements in common, and their only shared theme is a vague connection to the world of the theatre or of entertainment in general. There are, however, some stylistic resemblances between Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge, although fewer between these two films and Romeo + Juliet, a modern-dress Shakespeare updated to the California of the nineties.Strictly Ballroom relies heavily upon standard sporting drama clichés, notably the one about the plucky underdog who comes good. Although Scott is an experienced dancer, Fran is a mere beginner, with much less experience than Liz. She is also a social outsider, coming from a poor Spanish immigrant family and (in another cliché) is plain, bespectacled and dowdy. Of course, as soon as Fran takes off her glasses and lets her hair down she proves to be strikingly attractive. She also proves to be a formidable dance with the aid of her father who teaches her and Scott the authentic Spanish Paso Doble. There is also a storyline about Scott wanting to win the competition which eluded his father all those years ago. The film seems to be building up to the traditional conclusion in which Scott and Fran win a triumphant victory at the championships, thus confounding the doubters and a corrupt official who has been trying to fix the contest in favour of their rivals, although Luhrmann has a surprise up his sleeve which rather subverts all the clichés he has hitherto been relying on.One thing which the film shares with Moulin Rouge is a stylised, non- naturalistic style of acting, although nobody here overacts to quite the same extent as, say, Jim Broadbent did in Moulin Rouge. As in the later film, the look of Strictly Ballroom is quite defiantly lurid with a palette dominated by vivid Day-Glo colours, especially reds but also pinks, yellows and lime greens, even if the camera-work is not so manic.Moulin Rouge was a film I loathed, and Strictly Ballroom shares some of its faults, particularly an unattractive visual look and campy, mannered acting with deliberately overwrought emotions. Although Scott and Fran are supposed to be the heroes of this drama, I found it difficult to identify with them precisely because of the exaggerated way in which they are portrayed. In one respect, however, this is the better of the two films. Moulin Rouge is a musical made by people who can't sing. At least Strictly Ballroom is a dance film made by people who can actually dance, and the dance sequences are very well staged. It is, however, something of an acquired taste, and one I find myself unable to share. I am not, in fact, a great lover of the Red Curtain Trilogy as a whole; I (rather unfashionably) prefer Luhrmann's more recent productions, Australia (in which he seems to be reaching back to the traditions of the New Wave) and his masterly adaptation of The Great Gatsby. 5/10 "}{"Title":"Baz And His Beginning","Date":"5 May 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" A maverick dancer (Paul Mercurio) risks his career by performing an unusual routine and sets out to succeed with a new partner.Although not the international sensation that Moulin Rouge or Romeo and Juliet are, there is definitely the fingerprints of Baz Luhrmann all over this.

He apparently had to go the extra mile to get the Coca-Cola sign into the film, and it makes sense why he wanted it so badly it is the very definition of what makes a Baz film those bright, bold primary colors.This will probably never be considered a classic, and it has probably become more obscure over the last decade rather than more well-known, despite Baz's success.

They always take a woman who is already attractive and try to downplay her attractive parts rather than taking a woman who is believably ugly and making her beautiful.

The beginning is done in documentary style as his mother, Janet Leigh on crack, relates, her voice trembling with emotion, that it's Scott's year to win the Pan Pacific Grand Prix dance competition. Unfortunately, during the regionals, he broke out and did non-sanctioned steps, and his partner deserted him. This is all treated with the seriousness of a brain operation, which makes the film even more hilarious. A nerdy girl named Fran approaches Scott in the studio and asks to partner with him. He gives her a chance, and then needs to make a decision - win the Pan Pacific or do his own thing on the dance floor. On the way to the competition, some family secrets are revealed, and he and Fran fall in love.Told with hilarity, poignancy, and beautiful dancing, this is one of the all-time great dance films with Mercurio's electrifying moves, hot body, and good looks raising it to a very high level. Luhrmann's fast-paced and creative direction makes the film fly by. Some of the photography is spectacular dancing in front of the neon Coca-Cola sign, Scott learning the paso doble from Fran's relatives as a train passes by, a kiss at twilight, and the color-mad, cartoon-like flashback scene near the end of the film. The dance sequences themselves are fabulous, with the outrageous costumes, wild hair and beautiful steps.All of the performances are good, but my favorite by far is Thomson as a former ballroom star who puts on her happy face though her heart is breaking, i.e., Scott doesn't have a partner, Scott won't dance the correct steps - her constant near hysterics and overly dramatic concern are fantastic.The undertone of the film concerns the slimy, toupeed head of the regulatory committee Barry Fife (Hunter) who wants ballroom dance to remain conservative and by the book. Given the interior battles in the ice dancing arena, it wouldn't surprise me if such a thing exists in ballroom as well. No selfish, crowd-pleasing steps! Just make it -strictly ballroom.

Competitive ballroom dancing is one of those worlds that you have to become addicted to or you just laugh at all the peculiar things that are so important to them just because those strange things are important to them. The director of Strictly Ballroom apparently understood this and was able to capitalize on it. He took those funny peculiarities of ballroom dancing and perhaps exaggerated them to make truly humorous. But what makes this movie successful is that the director was able to make fun of competitive ballroom dancing while at the same time showing us the beauty and grace of ballroom dancing. Successfully making fun of something without while at the same time showing it respect is not something many directors can successfully do, yet Baz Luhrmann did it. I found myself laughing at the oddities of the people in this show while at the same time being carried away by the grace of the dancers. It was wonderfully refreshing. Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice underplayed their parts perfectly. Paul is the outsider who has earned the respect and fear of the others in the ballroom community. He isn't the overplayed dancing rebel you see in other movies such as Flashdance or Dirty Dancing. He comes off as so sincere,yet capable. Tara Morice was wonderful. She played to ugly duckling so well. She was so ugly at first I wondered how she could stand playing the part. Yet when her transformation is complete she is beautiful, but still so unglamorous compared to the Prima Donas that are the norm in competitive ballroom dancing. She appears not be wearing any makeup at all and it is this plain look that makes her stand out in beauty compared to all of the painted ladies (complete with spangles pasted on their faces). The screenplay was delightful. Tara comes off as so innocent, yet determined. Baz interwove much of the dancing with the dialog adding to the visual oddity. The music involves a little bit of everything, but always just enough and just the right kind for each scene. All of th e peripheral actors were just the right mix of sincerity and oddity to keep the texture of this film fun and beautiful at the same time.

The couple are opposed every step of the way by the heirarchy of the ballroom dance competition, which is intent upon making Scott their fair-haired boy. They are also quietly supported by Scott's father Doug, who some years before had his own dreams of dancing in a manner that wasn't strictly ballroom.  Anyway,it's the old formula, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, and there's a warm and fuzzy ending.

The film features one of the most remarkable physical transformations you'll ever see (as Tata Morice's character does go to the ball), and whizzes along with great panache throughout. It's easy to imagine that Luhrmann sees himself in the talented hero who refuses to obey the rules, although it's possible to suggest (in the light of his later films) that he actually resembles that character's father, who became so absorbed with his own trickery that he eventually lost the plot altogether.

Started out as a stage play, Strictly Ballroom tells a tale about (surprise!) ballroom dancing, with Luhrmann's signature touches on colours and zaniness.Ballroom dancing might not appeal to many, but this film is thoroughly enjoyable. It begins with the Waratah Championship, where we witness protagonist Scott Hastings losing the opportunity to win it, given his last minute impromptu decision to dance his own dance, totally neglecting the rules and form of ballroom dance.He loses his partner too, as she doesn't want someone to tangent off without letting her know, and of course, not wanting to stick to the norm. So left partnerless, Scott has to look for someone willing to partner him. In comes geeky Fran, a beginner who's looking for that big break into amateur ballroom dancing, and between the two, they form an unlikely alliance.Thrown in to the fray are both Scott's and Fran's family objections. With the Hastings, they are constantly looking for worthy dance partners to pair up with their son for the upcoming Pan Pacific Grand Prix. For Fran's, they shake their head at Scott's lack of rhythm. Coming from a Spanish dance background, they train the duo and put the rhythm back in their feet.The climax is one which is clichéd, but yet wonderful and moving. I'd bet if it's watched in a movie theatre, it'll have you up on your feet, and clapping away too.This movie contains a whole array of colourful and offbeat characters that one associates with a Luhrmann film. There's also an element of mystery thrown in as well, which keeps the audience guessing. With a mainly Australian cast, the characters are what make this movie so rich. This movie has a lot of heart, watch it and you'll understand what I mean.

Although it tends to be a little hokey, it has a good meaning to it. It's like an Australian Dirty Dancing. There are many metaphors and parallels in it. While it is a good entertainment movie, I would have to say that this movie was quite well done. This director is so incredibly awesome. I like his style and the techniques that he uses. This only adds to the wonderful movies that he has created. If you loved Moulin Rouge, you'll love this movie. The way that the director uses close-ups, camera angles, parallel editing, flashbacks, and many other techniques is truly inspiring. The actors all do a great job at their parts. The beginning of the movie is rather hard to get into because it is so unorthodox, but it picks up speed and about twenty minutes into it, you'll start to get into the style and rhythm that the story is portraying.

I remember seeing this movie with my family when we had no idea what it was and long before any infamy for Baz.  It's brilliant.  Visually stunning and utterly creative.  His movies are always a kaleidoscope of brilliant color and intricate detail.  It's also hilarious- subtle commentary on a subculture riddled with oddity, but a plot still relatable enough for any watcher to be drawn in, touched- and walk away with a good feeling about love and life.  That being said it is not saccharine sweet and it is far from cliche due to its odd approach and use of caricature humor.  Not only worth seeing- worth buying.

Interestingly enough, at the time I thought it was a total flop and not worth watching again.  Well, nearly 11 years later (wow! can't believe how time flies!), I stumble upon it and check it out for the second time.  Actually, I'd forgotten about it including the story line, so it was like watching it for the first time. I LOVED it!  Don't ask how or why now after all this time, but I couldn't help myself.  I even fell in love with the cheesy music and especially Paul Mercurio!  Wow is he hot in this flick!  To me, and some may think me crazy, it's a cross between Dirty Dancing and Pee-Wee Herman.  Dirty Dancing for the dances and similarities of the young lovers to the characteristics of Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze then Pee-Wee Herman for that lame goofiness, as you'll find throughout the movie, you can't help but laugh out loud at.  It's a weird, funny, dumb, stereotypical, unusual, love-filled, toe-tapping, make-you-want-to-get-up-and-dance movie that surprisingly pulls you in for more.  Yeah, I think I'll go out and buy it this time.

I usually don't like movies like this.  It is after all about dancing.  I had no idea that I would develop such and affection for this movie.  It's about a dance school where the dancers live, each and breath ballroom.  Once day a young trouble maker in the school decides to (gasp) dance his own steps.  This is not allowed in the society where everything is strictly ballroom.  He's one of the teachers and a young female student wants to be his dance partner because of his rebellious charisma out on the dance floor.  They fall in love.   (I hope I didn't give it away!)The film is silly but also serious and very carefully balances on that thin line.  It does find a perfect balance though.  On the one hand it is very serious in the way it presents the mysterious background of a former dance teacher and how these people live in fear by dancing only to rigorous pre planned steps.  On the other hand it's so silly to use dance to make a statement on the human condition.  But the silliness in which these people live their lives is what gives us affection for them.  We even love the villains in the movie.  The film hits the perfect note though and you will tell your friends about this little gem.Note  There are rumors that the screenplay is being adapted to a Broadway musical!

I saw this at a private screening before it's opening with very little preconception and the effortlessness on show by all makes the effect even more spectacular.Paul Mercurio plays Scott Hastings, king of his local dance troupe and destined to become one of the all time greats, but has a weakness - 'his own steps'.

I'll give you a brief summary since I've noticed one is missing. Scott Hastings is a champion ballroom dancer, but he is tired of dancing the same boring steps as everyone else. He wants to dance his own steps, but when he does so at a competition, he loses the trophy, his partner, and everyone in the ballroom world wonders what his problem is. Fran - just Fran - is a beginner who boldly and bravely tells Scott she wants to be his partner and dance his steps, his way at the Pan Pacific Grand Prix, a competition Scott has been working toward since he was six years old. Scott takes a chance on her, and as Scott's overbearing mother Shirley, teacher Les and ballroom friends speculate about his not having a partner, Scott and Fran work in secret. Fran, always referred to as an ugly duckling, begins to change her appearance as she works all this time with Scott, who at first tells her that the rumba is the dance of love, but it's pretend to try to ward off any amorous   feelings. Of course, the two do begin to have feelings toward one another. However, before the two can try out and become real partners, a mix up ensues and Scott has Tina Sparkle, a Pan Pacific champion, as a partner. I won't give this part, my favorite, away so I'll just say Scott and Fran are back as partners and are being taught the Paso Doble, a Spanish dance by Fran's Spanish father and grandmother. However, a secret from Scott's parents' past makes him once again dump Fran as his partner, but he finally realizes winning doesn't matter - it's dancing his steps with Fran that does.The dancing is great, my favorite scene being Scott and Fran's secret dance behind the curtains. It's very sweet, but not like most modern cinema where the audience is drowning in sap. And there's not the obligatory breakup scene between the two lovers. You know - the huge blowout, leading to an in-your-face over-the-top lovefest at the end. Scott and Fran never even come out and say, I love you, but the audience knows and we feel that warm glow as we fall in love too, with the film. Scott's kid sister Kylie is adorable, giving out clever and funny one-liners. Scott's mother is hilarious as are Liz, Scott's original partner, Wayne, Scott's friend and fellow competitor, drunk Ken Railings and all the rest of the ballroom folk, who are obsessed with their ballroom dancing world. The beginning is like a documentary of ballroom dancing and it too is very comical. The film seems to make fun of ballroom dancers but it's in a good-natured way. Parts of the film are ridiculous but that's why it's so fun! This is one of my top ten films and I recommend everyone to watch it!

In literature, Dickens was often successful due his his special genius, but even his work suffered from this uncomfortable blend.  Baz Luhrmann is less fortunate.  His appealing young boy and girl are virtually the only genuine characters in what is basically a simple love story about believing in yourself and finding someone who believes in you - a story that has been played many times against against many backgrounds (including those as far removed from each other as sports and science).While all of the foregoing cannot quite be dismissed as quibbling (because, after all, there is a plot, and there are characterizations of those who inhabit this story), the flaws are distinctly secondary to the imaginative, skillful, unusually colorful dancing that makes the picture so appealing - and is so well integrated in the story.  Luhrmann is exceptionally creative in devising ways to film a dance sequence, even while maintaining sufficient control of his camera and editing (as was not the case, in my judgment, in Moulin Rouge).  The result is a highly-charged, pulsating panorama, stylishly developed from the simplest story material.

Actually, the term artist might be a better word. His work is so astounding and unique, really like a painting come to life; he's fearless in his ideas and so willing to put all the things in his mind to the screen. Strictly Ballroom is a very charming little movie! Unlike Romeo + Juliet and especially Moulin Rouge (though I love them both), it needs nothing fancy but it's main focus the art and life of dance, and the love that can bloom from it. And he's very smart in choosing dancers that can actually act. I especially liked the ugly duckling technique--instead of whisking off her glasses and transforming her into a super model a la She's All That, Fran is still Fran--she's not beautiful, but has something about her that Scott sees through all his family and career drama. It's cute how they both act like children at times and...just the little, classy touches here and there, like Scott walking Fran home, and how everything resorts to dancing (Scott's apology to Fran for his insolence in the form of Doris Day's Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps). My favorite parts vary between the Time After Time dance sequence Fran actually sings herself, and the one where Fran, Scott, and her family flamenco dance, and Scott gets lost in the moment and almost kisses Fran before her grandmother interferes. ^_^9 out of 10 stars this is a beautiful little Baz movie; a romantic film with a flare that's enjoyable for everyone.

Besides the romance and the satisfying reconciliation between father and son, the movie's basic message is just inspiring (A life lived in fear is a life half-lived!)  The dancing is wonderful and should really be seen on the big screen for best effect. The only trouble, as one reviewer wrote, is that Paul Mercurio only has one solo dance number. He is an excellent dancer, giving a smouldering, very sexy performance, and Tara Morice is terrific as the ugly duckling who is still willing to stand up for herself and her dreams.  The scene where she nervously suggests that she, a nobody at his parents' dance studio, should team up with the golden boy, is a great piece of acting.  When I first saw this movie, I found the comedy sections annoying, and felt that they interfered with the story and the romance, but they have grown on me over the years.  This is a great sendup of the ballroom-dancing world without denying the ultimate power of dance.  There are several ways you can tell that this is not a Hollywood movie in the beginning Fran(Morice) actually looks convincingly ordinary, and even has *acne*!  The only disappointing part is when she takes off her glasses halfway through the movie, in the old Hollywood tradition, and never puts them on again!  Why is it that movie characters never ever seem to wear glasses out of necessity, and couldn't possibly be considered attractive while wearing them? Fran's family's little convenience store right under the highway overpass and next to the railway tracks is convincingly shown.  Armonia Benedito is real and terrific as Fran's grandmother, and in a Hollywood movie you would never find a woman her age commenting appreciatively on the body of a man young enough to be her grandson! Pat Thompson and especially Barry Otto do a good job as Scott's (Mercurio's) parents.  (I heard that Thompson was sick with cancer during the filming of this movie and sadly died soon afterwards, but it certainly doesn't show in her appearance.)  The two kids who play Scott's sister and her partner also do a nice job.  Peter Whitford as Scott's dance coach plays a man who despite his ambitions is genuinely fond of his pupil. The only one who is not really believable is Antonio Vargas as Fran's immigrant father.  A dancer so good would be out there performing or teaching in his own right, despite language limitations, not barely making ends meet on the wrong side of town! In fact, one of the things I like best about this movie is that there is no completely unsympathetic character in the whole thing.  In the end, everyone pitches in to give Scott and Fran their big chance, even his ex-partner who can't for the life of her understand what he is trying to do.  In the last scene, everyone has a dancing partner, and even the arch-villain of the piece has somebody to pick him up and dust him off, in a satisfying but very un-Hollywood way.

The film is also very well cast - Paul Mercurio really showed his qualities with this movie.  Highly recommended!

I love scenes like the one in *She's All That* where the heroine walks down the stairs after a makeover and you have that moment I call At that moment, she's the most beautiful girl(woman) in the world. They are rare. Another one is the scene in *Batman Forever* where Batman bursts through the skylight and Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian looks up. For just a moment, the camera trains on her and for that moment, there is no more beautiful woman in the world. Watch for these moments I'm not kidding.The heroic dance scene at the end of this movie portrays the heroine, Tara Morice, in such a way. Watching her start off as an almost repugnant character and scene by scene become more attractive until, at the end, she's absolutely adorable testifies to the directorial skills of Baz Luhrman.(By the way, Luhrman also directed *Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet* in which Claire Danes has one of those Most Beautiful Woman in the World moments when she is on the balcony watching the celebrations in angel wings. No wonder Romeo fell in love!)Add to the mix a rich variety of colorful and absurd supporting characters, a mildly evil subplot, great music, and a pair of pre-teen kids who play the role of a Greek Chorus, and this movie is an almost unbeatable entertainment, rich in surface detail, full of good humor, and yet anything but shallow.Rent it...now!

They're a dime a dozen, starting with Rocky and coming out every couple of years or so.We've all seen these movies.  But so has Luhrman.  And he KNOWS we've all seen it before, so he throws a brilliant touch of ironic, witty self-consciousness into the movie.Because honestly, what the characters want (to win an obscure dance competition) is pretty small stuff.  And their drive to win it is, well, kind of funny.  But -- and this is where Luhrman shows his skill as a director -- winning this competition, as small as it is, is *important* to the characters.  They want to win it, and by gosh, we want them to win it too.Scott and Fran are strange people, but darn it if we can't help but to like them and hope they win.  We truly care about them, and their plight, silly as it often is, can bring tears to our eyes and smiles to our faces.   It's this unique mix of parody and genuine involvement with the characters that makes this a *delightful* romantic comedy.I too had no interest in seeing dance movies.  I expected to want to fast forward over the dance sequences.  By the end, I was almost annoyed when they cut AWAY from the dance sequences.

Even though the film is an Aussie pic it still has a very European feel to it that gives it just that extra bit of elegance.  The only quibble I would have is the story is a little too straight forward and I thought some of choreography could have been a bit more acrobatic.  Check out Russ Tamblyn's dance moves and fan-friggin' amazing backflips in West Side Story and you'll see what I mean!Paul Mercurio is fantabulous as the hero, Scott Hastings and Tara Morice is equally fantabulous as Fran the ugly duckling turned beautiful swan.  Fantabulous ain't a word but what the hell.  I so loved this film I had to make up my own word to describe it!  Fantastic plus fabulous equals fantabulous!  Another magical scene is the one where Barry Otto as Scott's dad pleads with Scott to follow his dream because he and his mother didn't.  We lived out lives in fear! he screams to Scott.  Man.  It always gives me chills.  It's one of the most powerful moment of truth scenes in the history of film.  With the music building and the emotions of the characters swelling.

Perhaps it is because here, Luhrmann does not resort to operatic tragedy that weighs down Romeo+Juliet and Moulin Rouge, and instead makes it all about the dance. This movie, with its small budget and cast of unknowns, is an all for fun outing.

He finds a partner who is really a beginner, but her father and grandmother join forces to teach both of them to feel the dance in their hearts. The stuffy old judge pulls the plug on the music, but the audience and other dance partners at the competition begin rythmic clapping for them to dance.  Oh, and of course, they fall in love in the process.There are several interesting extras on the DVD, including a 30-minute feature on actual Australian ballroom dancers, their stories, and the results of a competition.

And on her face she's got the worst case of pimples I've ever seen in my life. She is clumsy too and is dressed essentially in one of Andre the Giant's old dirty T shirts. As the movie progresses she gradually becomes quite attractive and nimble on her feet. I don't understand that. Is she still ugly, but we are seeing her looks improve by viewing her through the eyes of her dance partner, who is falling in love with her? A love is blind sort of thing? Or does her growing self confidence miraculously transform her teeth, hair, complexion and wardrobe? Discounting those questions that I kept asking myself, I though this was a pleasant film. No violence to speak of. No foul language. No sex. Just a nice little film where dancers with lots of talent have the opportunity to showcase their craft. There's no heavy plot to follow and get you thinking. Purely for the entertainment value of the dancers. I certainly DO NOT think this was an amazingly wonderful, great, 10 star movie.

Someone recommended this to me after I said I liked the documentary Mad Hot Ballroom so I spent the first few minutes thinking it was a documentary, then after seeing what looked like the set of drag queens from Priscilla, Queen of Desert -- I thought maybe it was a satirical mokumentary like Best in Show.

I had already watched this movie on ICE It was called Cutting Edge and was released about 11 months earlier. Same beginner paired w/ pro. Same, introduction of shocking new steps. Similar tension of partners that turns to love. Same work towards winning the final trophy. etc. etc. Yes, Cutting Edge didn't have garish colors/costumes, what have you - but it had more a more serious edge and I felt actually explored the main characters instead of leaving them as 1 dimensional (rebel + ugly duckling).4. Just kind of disappointing The film had some interesting elements that could've been developed into a better movie (the dad, Fran's foreign background, the difference between the dad's selfish showing off new moves vs. the fact that Fran got to contribute a move and her dad suggested some. Which brings me to another point, there were very few moves they did that seemed at all different or shocking. Was the new moves the fact that they danced a Latin dance more authentically???But if you don't think Baz Luhrman is an embarrassment to film making, if you're looking for an unoriginal love story; underdog competing to win with generic one dimensional characters ... you might like it.

The wonderful Antonio Vargas and his flamenco dancing is the highlight of this show, but the rest of the dance sequences are extremely frustrating. How can you show 2 people dancing without filming below their waists? Fred Astaire had the right idea when he insisted his dance sequences be filmed  in 1 take and always with full length shots to show what the dancers are doing.

The strict rules, perhaps, are mocked as much as the people involved. Once again, it's the clichéd story of a rebel who is the good guy and the establishment who are the bad people. (Will filmmakers ever get themselves out of the 1960s?)Add some stupid humor, a very annoying lead woman (the mother of the star dancer), and a predictable storyline and you have another overrated critics' favorite.The good parts of the film are the colorful dancers and general cinematography. The dancing is excellent, too.

Basically, set in Australia, this tells the story of ballroom dancer Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio) who when it comes going on the dance floor does not stick to specific steps, he makes his own steps, being over exuberant to stand out and win, but the judges deliberately ignore him. After losing to a rival couple at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship a year ago, he also has his dancing partner Liz Holt (Gia Carides) leave him for another dancer, and there are only weeks to go until the next dance off. While his highly competitive mother Shirley (Pat Thomson) and timid father Doug (Barry Otto) are trying to find him a professional partner, they are unaware he has already found shabby non-professional dancing enthusiast Fran (BAFTA nominated Tara Morice). Scott is initially filled with scepticism with Fran until she unleashes her Pasodoble moves to their routine, and she sees her Spanish gypsy family strut their stuff too, and as time goes by she becomes more attractive and confident as well. Scott and Fran spend a lot of time together rehearsing and getting closer, but conniving president of the Australian Dancing Federation, Barry Fife (Bill Hunter), tells him that his parents also lost the dance competition. Apparently this was because Doug invented his own dance steps as well, so Scott is persuaded to get partner Liz back to win for his father's sake, but actually the contest has been fixed so they will lose. Unhappy Fran is forced back to beginner's school, and Doug confronts his son to tell the truth about what happened to him in the past, he was tricked into letting Shirley dance with friend Les Kendall (Peter Whitford) with conventional moves, and they lost anyway. Scott realises he has been tricked too, finds Fran and convinces her to rejoin him for the contest, and they return to the floor to dance from the heart. Barry is furious and interrupts their performance to disqualify them, but they continue dancing anyway with the music resuming and the crowd being moved by their spirit. In the end we do not know whether Scott and Fran won the competition, but it is not important, as the performance ends and Shirley and Doug dance together too, the crowd join the floor as well, and Scott and Fran share their true love kiss. Also starring John Hannan as Ken Railings, Sonia Kruger as Tina Sparkle, Kris McQuade as Charm Leachman, Pip Mushin as Wayne Burns and Leonie Page as Vanessa Cronin. Mercurio is cool as the rebel dancer who doesn't stick to the rules, and Morice is good as the ugly duckling who turns into a great dancing swan, the rest of the cast of their parts well too, it starts like a mock documentary before becoming the nice love story, but of course it is the extravagantly colourful and sparkly costumes and smashing dance moves that steal the show, a must see romantic comedy drama. Also including a great soundtrack of songs, including John Paul Young's Love Is In The Air, Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time, Doris Day's Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps, John Paul Young's Standing In The Rain and The Champs Tequila. It won the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Original Film Score for David Hirschfelder and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Very good!

Even his own mother despairs at his movements and the embarrassment they caused. Determined to continue on his own path, Scott looks for a new partner but the only one that seems to get what he is trying to do and is happy to lose as a result is the partnerless ugly duckling Fran. Scott gives her a shot and gradually the two start to work well together despite her total lack of confidence. As they prepare for their first contest, the sight fo Scott and Fran together causes consternation on the scene.The opening moments sum up the film really well as Luhrmann takes the uninteresting world of smalltown ballroom dancing contests and paints a mix of romantic drama and spoof. Many of us have local passions in which we will never rise above the local newspapers and this film gently lampoons that type of activity by exaggerating it and its characters while also keeping it engaging and enjoyable. The plot follows a fairly obvious arch but it is the energy and sheer invention that runs through the film that makes it so much better than the plot summary would suggest. The colouring and the feel of the film compliments the slightly exaggerated sense of humour and, as many have said, Luhrmann does a great job of announcing himself on an international scale. It doesn't really have jokes, but the hypersense of delivery makes it feel engagingly fresh and comic.The cast more or less fit into this style of delivery rather than standing out in their own right but everyone is good in their own way. Mercurio isn't the most charismatic of leads and he is a bit bland but he more or less does the job as his character is one of the straighter of the piece. Morice is pretty good alongside him and, although neither is brilliant, they work well together and make for a sympathetic couple. The larger-than-life supporting characters are much better and provide much of the energy the film needs. Hunter, Thomson, Whitford and Otto are among those that turn in reliable performances in this regard.Overall then this is a wonderful debut from Luhrmann. It manages to mock and convince at the same time &#150; exaggerating to produce energy and humour while never letting the audience lose touch with the story or the characters. I'm sure it won't be to everyone's tastes but I found it an effortlessly enjoyable film that has an unique feel and energy to it that make it worth seeing.

Now years later, I amazed at how much and little Baz's style has changed.  In so many ways both of these films act as a warm-up for Moulin Rouge!, but I think that S.B. is so much more.  The metaphor of the dance for life is an ancient concept, but the performative twist that the film adds deepened my appreciate of other works with the same idea in the center (e.g. Much Ado about Nothing).  This movie is worth watching for the dancing and costumes alone, but the provocative (although not entirely successful) post-modern camera work is what kept me hooked.  Luhrman's style is entirely his own, and I think that's why I continue to return to his films even when I they sometimes bother me and often fail.  Soooo, if you have not seen this film - rent it, watch it, and then watch Moulin Rouge!  You will appreciate both, and have been witness to one of the most visionary directors of the day.

If I had to choose between this movie and Moulin Rouge, I think I would pray for a massive power outage and so that I can read a book by candlelight instead of watching either of these self-indulgent, over-acted, seriously over-hyped piles of crap! There is good costuming, but lordy knows that there is nothing resembling a plot. Other reviewers have compared it to Top Gun with music, I think it more like a Batman-serial - good versus evil, lone wolf against the establishment, cheesy villains, wooden dialog. Seen the plot a thousand times, and almost always done with more taste.Sorry - I just can't keep writing, words are starting to fail. Don't waste the $2.00 to rent this, go get Shall We Dance or Dirty Dancing and get it out of your system. "},{"Title":"Good film","Date":"18 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I recently watched the first film in the noted Red Curtain Trilogy by Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann, Strictly Ballroom. This 1993 indie classic preceded its more well known and more highly budgeted siblings, Romeo + Juliet, and Moulin Rouge. While I enjoyed the twists to modernize Shakespeare in the former and the non-stop roller-coaster of the latter- and I am notoriously averse to musicals, I believe that Strictly Ballroom is probably the best of the three films, followed by Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet. They are all good films, mind you, and Luhrmann is one of the most innovative filmmakers around, but there is an emotional punch that this film packs that the two later films lack- as they are more style over substance, albeit wonderful style. This is not to argue that Strictly Ballroom is flawless- it's not, but it is a prime example of a film making use of a 'classic' formula, yet avoiding cliché by virtue of its innovation and excellence of execution in all areas&#133;. Yet, the film is also a wonderfully filmed piece. There are two scenes that are just gorgeously composed. Early in the film Scott and Fran are practicing on the roof of the Les Kendall (Peter Whitford) dance studio, where his parents teach, under a Coca-Cola sign, as the sun sets. Alone, the composition is wonderful, but as a version of the Cyndi Lauper hit song Time After Time plays on it is a memorable shot. Then, there is the scene, set near Fran's parents' home at a railyard, that could have been right out of Dr. Zhivago- with a rich dark blue sky, a chain link fence, and just the two characters on a barren landscape. Just beautiful. It's no wonder Luhrmann's films are all visual marvels.In a sense this light-hearted comedy reminded me most of the later My Big, Fat Greek Wedding in how it approached odd situations and characters and humanized them by having them funneled through experiences that moviegoers have seen too many times before with people like themselves, and it's this very dissonance of the unexpected and the expected, as well as great acting and film-making, that allow films like those two to succeed, where lesser films and filmmakers fail. "},{"Title":"Not up to my expectations","Date":"18 April 2003","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I'm sitting here a little confused as to what I think about this movie.  I had intended on seeing it for several years, but hadn't. After seeing Moulin Rouge and absolutely loving it, my interested was further peaked.  I finally had the opportunity to watch it tonite and I'm almost wishing I hadn't, because now the mystique is gone for me.Baz is famous for his flashiness, his incredible use of color and spectacle to tell his stories.  This movie had plenty of that, which I appreciated greatly.  While I am normally drawn to more subtle dramas I always welcome a diversion from that genre, and this did not disappoint.  One can tell from this production that Baz is involved in the theater because it could (and may very well have) been a musical production on the stage.  I enjoyed the quick pace and some interesting camera angles - it was interesting to see the advent of his unconventional cinematography, something I admired in Moulin Rouge.**SPOILER ALERT**Throughout the film, however, I was conflicted as to whether this movie was done with tongue firmly in cheek, or if it was supposed to be some kind of fairy tale.  Regardless, I found myself rolling my eyes during a couple of parts, especially the ending.  I kept thinking, why would Fran go back? Why would the dance partner who had been dumped several times at that point help out at the end?  What was up with the slapsticky fight scenes at the end? Why would everyone in the audience just decide that they Gotta Dance!I know, I'm looking too much into this film. I should just look at the pretty colors, be awed at the dancing and forget about the plot holes. In that spirit, I'll just have to remember that the next time I have a conflict with a future boyfriend's father I just need to let him teach me how to dance and I'm his honorary daughter-in-law forever.Having just bashed the heck out of it, I do have to say that in the moments I wasn't looking over at the book I had laying next to me, wishing I was reading it at that point, I was trying to figure out what movies this reminded me of.  The characters called to mind a couple of movies  The weird, psychotic mom was something out of A Clockwork Orange, a few of the weird looking minor characters were reminiscent of the Soundgarden video Black Hole Sun, the creepy but cool dad had Crispin Glover written all over him and the rest of the teased and primped characters (women AND men, unfortunately) were straight out of a John Waters movie.  Which made me feel like watching Pink Flamingos again.One scene I would like to commend Baz for was the bizarre flashback/dancing scene between Scott's parents.  The ghoulish makeup, exaggerated gestures and weird blocking called to mind the scene in David Lynch's film Blue Velvet where Dean Stockwell sings his ditty into the lightbulb.  It was a very entertaining scene and pretty much saved me from turning the movie off.I can see how much Baz has grown since making this film, and the only reason why I'm not completely trashing it is because it was his first effort. One thing I have come to expect from a Baz Luhrmann film is that I'm going to be elated, wrapped up in the spectacle and then suddenly feel like I've been punched in the gut.  I guess he started that after this movie, because while I didn't quite feel punched in the gut (in a bad way, not in the aforementioned good way) I felt empty after seeing this film.  I would give it about 2 1/2 out of 5 stars, and that's only because of its quirkiness and because I'm biased toward succeeding films.--Shelly "},{"Title":"Holy lord!","Date":"11 June 2002","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This movie was a pure stinker.

It seemed a little rushed, and combined once again with the hard to understand, 150 decibel dialogue and the constant jumping around from character to character almost made me sea-sick.

The Graduate, Groundhog Day, Rushmore, and Deconstructing Harry are fabulous comedies. Watch them instead. I suppose Strictly Ballroom is enjoyed by the same audience that likes Ally McBeal.
