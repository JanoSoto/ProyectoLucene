[{"Title":"The Missing Matthau / Lemmon film","Date":"6 August 2005","Score":"22 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" In the 1990s there were a slew of films in which Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau appeared together. The first two were GRUMPY OLD MEN, and it's sequel GRUMPIER OLD MEN, both of which had good box office. Then came THE GRASS HARP, which is technically one of their joint films, but is actually a dramatization of a fine novel by Truman Capote that had an excellent ensemble cast, and that only had one scene with the two actors together. OUT TO SEA was another Lemmon and Matthau romp, and finally came THE ODD COUPLE II, which was a weak (but amusing) sequel.Technically, between THE GRASS HARP and OUT TO SEA there was to be this film. It was to star Matthau as a Democratic ex-President, whose one term in office was following the one term of his rival, Republican ex-President Lemmon, and both would be followed by Republican incumbent Dan Ackroyd. But Matthau could not be in the film, presumably due to health problems. Instead, his role was filled in by James Garner. Although one likes watching the chemistry of Matthau and Lemmon in their comedies, the substitution of Garner is probably for the best. Garner's character is like Bill Clinton or John Kennedy, a ladies' man type. In fact, his wife is divorcing him during the film (we only see her briefly when he is elected President). Somehow Matthau could not have fit that type of role.The 1990s also saw several pictures that tackled the problems of the Presidency. The best of these was THE American PRESIDENT, wherein Michael Douglas tries to balance his job's duties, with his performance ratings, and his falling in love with a woman whose political agenda can be used to bash him (Annette Benning). There was also DAVE, which was a variation on an old Akim Tamiroff film THE MAGNIFICENT FRAUD, wherein a double (KEVIN KLINE) finds he must continue to play the role of the President when the President (who is corrupt) has a devastating stroke. There the double finds himself falling in love with the First Lady (SIGOURNEY WEAVER - who reciprocates), and fighting an unscrupulous, power-hungry chief of staff (FRANK LANGELLA). MY FELLOW Americans fits in with this pair of films in continuing the trend.Lemmon wins his term as President by defeating his Democratic rival Garner. But four years later Garner defeats incumbent Lemmon. But four years after that Garner is defeated by Lemmon's former Vice President Ackroyd. In the third year of his term, Ackroyd is told by his chief of staff, Bradley Whitford (ironically a member on the television series THE WEST WING currently), that a major financial scandal involving Ackroyd is about to be revealed, and will finish him politically. Ackroyd and Whitford decide to kill the scandal by framing Lemmon for taking the bribes involved. But Lemmon is tipped off about the scandal by news reporter Sela Ward (seeking an exclusive), and Garner learns of it from Democratic Party head Wilfrid Brimley (and encouraged to check into it with the possibility of being renominated for the Presidency again). When the key man in the scandal is shot and killed by a rogue CIA man (Everett McGill, in an exceptionally good, creepy performance), the lives of the two ex-Presidents are in danger. They are forced to join forces to prove Ackroyd's perfidy. They are also forced to confront each other and their own failings.The reason the film works is it forces the audience to think of what is wrong with the political system. The initial ten minutes, with it's rapid turnover of one term Presidents, mouthing the typical clich√©s, reminds us that our leaders (with rare exceptions) rarely do more than protect their political hides by not doing anything that would really rock things. This is similar to the situation in THE American PRESIDENT where Douglas will not confront his Republican rival, Richard Dreyfus, who is questioning the influence of Benning on the President's policies, and who is willing to make a deal to pass some cosmetic, worthless crime bill instead of tackling the pro-gun lobby.In MY FELLOW Americans the moment of truth is when both ex-Presidents learn that their mediocre policies cost a nice family their job and their home. Garner finally shows how fed up he is, towards the end, when he tells Lemmon that he is sick of thinking of how little he really accomplished in the four years he was President, and how he wants to demolish Ackroyd's corrupt administration because it is what the starry eyed believers of Democracy expect their Presidents to do.The cast was quite in the film, but one wishes Lauren Bacall had had more scenes with Lemmon (her husband in the movie), and that Esther Rolle had been in a few more scenes as the White House cook. But otherwise it is a good Garner/Lemmon comedy, even though it was to have been a Matthau/Lemmon film.

You gotta love it.My Fellow Americans features Jack Lemmon and James Garner as ex-presidents on the run when they discover a cover-up with the present Chief of Staff (Dan Aykroyd) in the middle.This isn't a movie anyone's going to take seriously, and well they shouldn't.  There are lots of moments here that will elicit a laugh or two, maybe three.  And what plot there is whizzes by at such a fast pace that there's more time to concentrate on the guffaws.Lemmon and Garner play their parts as you'd expect.  That they go the dumb route is no surprise; in fact, it makes their presence here all the more entertaining.  Aykroyd basically plays the heavy here, so there's no real chance for him to generate any laughs.  A shame, since he's usually so good at that.Then there's the fact that real gems like Bacall and Brimley and Ward are just given throw-away parts; it's good to see them, of course, but you'd figure they'd have more to do (especially Bacall!!).Kudos, though, to John Heard as the dim-witted Vice President.  Some of the biggest laughs in this movie (for me) came from him.  His eulogy at the funeral scene early in the movie always makes me laugh out, as does his pithy observations such as Hey, a hat!.  Beats me why he isn't in more movies.As I said, the laughs are there, and if you demand nothing more from a comedy than to laugh, you'll want to do your political duty and rent My Fellow Americans - the one movie that insults both parties equally.Seven stars, plus one extra for putting up an excellent fakade.

It's always sad when another good Democrat dies, Douglas says to a Secret Service Agent while on the way to the funeral. I believe that the deceased was a Republican, sir, he replies. To that, Douglas says, Oh. Then this might not be so bad.The current President, Haney (Dan Aykroyd) took kickback while Kramer was president. And Haney's trying to pin them on Kramer. Kramer and Douglas both know about it and Haney's going to try to kill them. When that proves unsucessful, Kramer and Douglas end up stranded alone in the middle of nowhere. So the two people, who loathe each other, must work together to tell thier fellow Americans while seeing the effect of their presidency on the general people.There are too many political movies. There aren't many political comedies. There are even less raunchy political comedies. In fact, it seems that My Fellow Americans should have been raunchier to warrant an R rating. Peter Segal wanted it to be ribald, but it would have been easier to write for if they didn't have an PG-13 rating in mind, so they could open up the humor a little.I really like the two leads. They had great chemistry together, I thought they actually hated each other. Lemmon and Garner had a great sense of comedic timing. The movie knew it was a comedy, but tried to take itself in a serious way, which has a great result. Other characters, however, pop up and then leave. Kay Griffin (Sela Ward), the reporter, has about two scenes, and Ben just pops up out of nowhere.It was extremely funny.

I actually avoided seeing it so as to avoid seeing two cool actors make asses out of themselves (in a bad way). The film was rather poorly marketed, in other words. It looked like Beavis and Butthead with two old guys (in a bad way).In other words, I'm glad this was the film shown on an Amtrak train a few years back. I think I was laughing harder than anyone else in my car. Frankly, I think a few jokes sailed over people's heads. I remember in particular that the hilarious mispronunciation of facade by Dan Ackroyd's clueless VP didn't merit a titter. A few people looked at me oddly when I laughed at it.This isn't brilliant film-making, mind you. It's simply a vehicle for a lot of very talented comic actors to have fun with some ripe material. It may dip into preachiness now and again, but that is always redeemed ASAP by an entertaining round of rapid-fire bickering.On an aside, I have to say that I've been in love with Lauren Bacall since I saw The Big Sleep for the first time. It was great to see her in this and even greater to see that she still has a knack for the sharply delivered one-liner. Also, for someone born in the 20s she looks amazing. You heard me right. At 82 years, Lauren Bacall is still hot. Bogie was a very lucky man.

Had Walter Mathau been cast in the role of Democratic Governor Matt Douglas and not James Garner, we would've been calling this Grumpiest Old Men, as if it were a sequel to the inspired comedies Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made in the mid-nineties.But I digress. This is an equally inspired comedy, that knows its tone, knows its audience, and makes good use of its entire cast, especially its lead, Lemmon and Garner, who are unbelievably charismatic together as two bitter political rivals that have proudly clung to this white collar, boyhood way of fighting for decades now. Lemmon plays Republican Senator Russell Kramer and Garner is Democratic Governor Matt Douglas, who have both endured four years in office, first being Kramer defeating Douglas, and then four years later, vice-versa. Now incumbent Douglas has been defeated by former vice president William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) and his vice president Ted Matthews (John Heard). Up to speed? The last few years have been quite quiet for Kramer, who has been publishing books left and right and speaking at various schools and even for insurance companies. Douglas has endured a rougher road, working on publishing a book that is a sub-par effort according to his editor and is in the mix of a long divorce battle. On a plane to a funeral at Air Force One for a fallen Republican, the two men quibble all throughout the plane-ride and cement the fact to us why they have been bitter rivals for so many long years.When a serious scandal goes on that a man by the name of Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) offered current president Haney kickbacks when he was a vice president, the Democratic Party plots to frame Kramer. But when Charlies is assassinated and Kramer and Douglas are put on a helicopter allegedly headed for Camp David under the order of Haney, but shipped into the middle of nowhere, the two cantankerous old presidents must learn to get along and attempt to stop the kickback scandal currently at hand in the White House.It's easy to say this film is never boring. What impressed me immediately was how dialog-driven and event-assisted this film became during the middle of its first act and how it never ceased to become lengthy and ponderous. The film uses its two men not as fiery weapons, but as human characters as they try in work through an incomprehensible situation paired with someone they are not fond of. The film continues to throw in different little twists, to keep its slender plot interesting, and never do they seem obligatory and forced. They are all little pieces attributing to the larger conflict at hand and all come to a close nicely.Writers E. Jack Kaplan, Richard Chapman, and Peter Tolan are too concerned with infusing satire into this material rather than have the characters remain presidential archetypes. Had they not gone for a more satirical effort, depicting corruption in the White House, brutal honest among elected officials, and widely different outlooks on both characters all attempting to cater to the same goal, this could've been a relatively strained, dull, unimportant effort. Yet largely because of the way the film injects little humorous quirks that make both Republicans and Democrats tick is the reason for My Fellow Americans' success as a film and as a whole.One could argue the film plays it too safe for a comedy directed at satirizing and lampooning American politics. I agree; the film relatively works in an inconsequential light and its prime goal isn't to offend or promote further hatred to one side or the other. But this could work in part of its success too, since we're so accustomed to each side bitterly debating with each other and the almost deliberate and apparent contention each side holds with one another that maybe a safe satire on politics is kind of what we need. A fun, free-spirited kind of take on the issue. It doesn't need to be completely offensive, and the film isn't always as safe as it would appear. Yet in the long run, Republicans shouldn't be too offended at the jabs at their stinginess and Democrats shouldn't be offended at the punches at their free use of money.My Fellow Americans is written efficiently and played nicely by its three writers and directed with a nice loose grip by Peter Segal, who too directed the joyously fun, quick-witted comedy that was Tommy Boy, that emphasized on the snappy worldplay that this project heavily relies on. Both films work well in the same fields, giving us two likable main characters, two talented screen-performers, an easily-digestible script, competent writing, solid direction, and overall, a cheeriness about a subject that we need and should cherish in current times. The whole exercise works on its own merits and that could be the reason you like or dislike this film as a whole.Starring Jack Lemmon, James Garner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Heard. Directed by Peter Segal.

It must have made Walter Matthau, Lemmon's comic counterpart for over 30 years, feel pretty expendable to see the same Odd Couple chemistry with Garner performing so well across Lemmon.The movie cleverly starts out with Lemmon's character presidential candidate Kramer having been just elected president, thanking his constituents with joy and giving a speech about how dreams are like children, they must be nurtured, this is a running gag here, this is the only speech he has and he gives it at least a hundred times in the first hour of the movie alone. We then fast-forward four years and we hear Jack Lemmon at a podium in front of a big crowd, this time conceding to his opponent and giving a speech, obviously a lie, about how much confidence he has in his opponent to run the country. We start to think the movie is about to settle down, but before we get to know any more about the characters, we're fast forwarded 4 years, where Garner's character Matt Douglas has just lost to Kramer's former vice-president (Akroyd), and if that's not a long enough introduction, we fast-forward 3 more years we finally begin to settle in, and after the movie has given us enough motion sickness, we see Kramer and Douglas, feeling nostalgic and unfulfilled about their mediocre administations. When you think about it, it's nothing more than a midlife crisis. After that, however things kind of get confusing. Haney frames Kramer for a fraud as a way for the administration to defer blame. That's understandable, but for some odd reason, this pits the two ex-presidents together into a life-or-death battle against the national security agency. I think the plot is ridiculous, maybe I should've been more astute, but why was Douglas' life in danger? Why didn't the two ex-presidents go to the local authorities? Why was the NSA involved? However, regardless of the lack of anything convincing, the movie is undeniably fun. I'm not sure exactly why the characters are doing what they're doing, but at least they're having fun doing it and we can't help but have some fun watching them on their shenanigans, accidentally marching in a gay parade, hitching a ride with some illegal immigrants, posing as presidential impersonators of themselves, and the like. The humor also borders on political satire as well. At the end of the movie, the good guys win in Disney-like fashion and everything turns out just fine and dandy, and because of that my first reaction was extremely joyous walking out of the theater. I was thinking, Yay! The presidents won! They're gonna clean out Washington! That's what a happy ending does for you, but shortly after, it struck me how ridiculous and Disney-like the movie was. I think Roger Ebert said it best when he said it's soon to be forgotten, but it has its moments. It makes little sense, true, but it's pretty fun.

The evidence is not there, so they must travel back to Washington somehow and meet the problem head on.That the evidence isn't there is symptomatic of the film's weaknesses. The whole trip from North Carolina to Ohio was pointless except that it gave the two ex rivals a chance to have comic encounters with red necks, the unemployed, illegal immigrants, and the like. The business with the imminent scandal about kick backs is just a peg to hang a funny adventure on. After enough amusing episodes you forget what the whole deal was about anyway and just enjoy the performances of Lemon and Garner. There are a few brief scenes of credible pathos too. More than once, Lemon almost breaks down when he looks in the mirror and notices that he's aged.And Garner is given a brief but bombastic flag-waving populist speech that's unconvincing, yet Lemon comments that if Garner had spoken like that during the debates, he, Lemon, would have lost by a wider margin. Lemon is sincere, but it would have been much funnier if he'd said that he, Lemon, would have WON the race. These guys are two throat-cutting rascals and yet the audience is supposed to applaud a lusty, go-get-'em panegyric that's straight out of the Boy Scout's Handbook.It has its diverting moments and gets a number of chuckles but it's determinedly lower middle-brow. It has some vulgarity but it's not used to great comic effect. The script flirts (twice) with the f word but doesn't use it. Mostly the situations and characters are cute. It all turns into an amusing action movie at the end -- at the happy end.The two principals are appealing, one a Republican, the other a Democrat, but the cracks are equally distributed between, say, Kennedy's womanizing and Ford's clumsiness. Garner is the more likable of the two, perhaps because he looks and sounds more like a political manipulator, and perhaps because it's sad to see how old and stiff Jack Lemon has become. Two ladies are on brief and welcome display, both stunning Marg Helgenberger and Sela Ward. The most compelling character is the villainous Everett McGill, the spawn of Demos. He has a skull-like face and his hair almost reaches his eyebrows. The arrangement doesn't leave much room for a forehead.It's not an insulting flick. It's not bad. But you can almost hear the joints creaking as it reaches for laughs, many of which elude it.

Especially, having to play roles as two former Presidents of The U.S. Which of course, everyone thinks President's are always serious and would never say such things, like these two did. I have to admit, the beginning of the movie was quite boring and it lagged. Finally after awhile the fun begins and I could not stop laughing at these two the whole time they cracked jokes about each other. Every time something went wrong in their journey to solve the mystery that was going to put both of them in a dilemma,again they both could not help but to take cheap shots at each other, which were all hilarious.I was expecting Actor Dan Akroyd to be the main comedian in this movie but his part was far different from all his movies he ever acted in. That of course did not make a difference how funny this movie was. Once again, hail to the chiefs and all their funny moments throughout the movie. I definitely give this movie a 10!

It's helped by very good dialog and very good acting to make what is essentially another road buddy picture stand out from the crowd.This film begins with a prologue. In this fictionalized world, the US has had two recent one-term presidents (Jack Lemmon and James Garner). Neither was especially popular and both hate each other and come from the other political party. And, now that they are no longer in office, they both feel a bit useless. However, when the rather amoral new president gets in trouble for ethics violations, he's easily convinced to simply blame it on one of his predecessors (Lemmon). But, when Garner accidentally stumbles into this, he, too, is now in trouble with the evil new president. It seems that the new president is more than happy to now set up BOTH ex-presidents--and soon Lemmon and Garner are on the run from agents who seem eager to kill them. Can they avoid these crazed agents and help expose the truth? And, can they manage to get along long enough to get this done? While this film occasionally has lapses in writing (such as the getaway on horseback and the very end of the film), much of the time the film works when neither ex-president is doing anything other than argue with each other. This makes the film seem a bit like Grumpy Old Men--and simply having the two fine actors gripe at each other is more than enough to provide laughs and some fine moments.By the way, if you do watch, pay attention during the horseback scene. You can notice that the faces of Garner and Lemmon was VERY clumsily pasted onto the stuntmen to make it look like they are doing the actual riding. It's amazing how much better such CGI has gotten since 1996.

Nothing is more comical than watching the two forced to sort through a recent scandal, along with an assassination plot on their lives, all the while a respect happens between the two, yet their disdain for each other adds to the hilarity of the movie.

Along the way, their efforts result in numerous farcically-staged attempts on their lives. That the screenplay works quite well in political thriller terms, with dramatically satisfying plot twists throughout, is rewarding enough; it's so much icing on the cake that the accompanying gags are equally strong, making this one of the most facile blends of suspense and comedy since the films of Colin Higgins. The screenplay's considerable entertainment value -- particularly for a political junkie -- is enhanced and brought to its full potential by solid direction and cutting, as well as the unassailable professionalism of a first-rate cast. The on screen chemistry and formidable comic timing of Jack Lemmon and James Garner as the former presidents, in their first and only screen pairing, is delightful, and thankfully so one or both dominate almost every scene in the film. They receive equally expert support from Lauren Bacall, demonstrating her rarely-exploited talent for comedy; Dan Aykroyd in an uncharacteristically restrained performance; and the always-solidly professional John Heard, as well as an extraordinarily sharp supporting cast studded with many familiar faces -- such as Wilford Brimley (China Syndrome), Sela Ward, and Esther Rolle of Good Times fame -- though not all are necessarily household names. Any lover of political satire or action-oriented farce will find this film's running time to be time well spent, and C-SPAN addicts -- provided that they have a sense of humor about their passion &#150; will be richly rewarded.

Douglas tries to help Kramer but they're soon running for their lives as the CIA sets out to kill them. And it's a comedy.Very funny movie. Garner and Lemmon play off each other well and their verbal sparrings are highlights of the movie. Their are jabs given at Dems and Reps (although the Reps get bashed more). There's also an incredible supporting cast including Bradley Whitford (years before The West Wing); John Heard as an idiotic vice president (an obvious parody of Dan Quayle); Esther Rolle as a White House cook and Lauren Bacall (shamefully underused) as Lemmon's wife. Aykroyd surprisingly underplays his role as the President. Also this film is extremely gay positive which gives it extra points in my book.**DEFINITE SPOILERS** The presidents are able to hide from the CIA in a Gay Pride parade; Dykes on Bikes (an actual group) get them to a library they need to use and a gay man (winningly played by Jeff Yagher) saves their lives at the end. **END SPOILERS** Funny, fast-paced, dramatic, gay positive...all in all a very good film.

But someone in the White House comes up with an idea to frame them for a scandal that is about to hit the sitting president, Kramer's former Vice President played by Dan Akroyd. And lingering in the background is a bumbling idiot of a Vice President, played by John Heard, who makes Dan Quayle seem like a diplomatic paragon by comparison.

The movie was very well done i think. The actors who played the presidents were a perfect match. Jack lemmon was fantastic in the movie. He is my favourite actor because i think he is that kind, natural, caring person. Though now he's gone, he will always be remembered when ever someone talks about him, do a speech on him, or even when his movies come on tv again and again and again. He was a great actor and he never wanted to make movies that would be boring to the auidence. He waited for good scripts and he always did the great movies as well as the other actors. My favourite movies he starred in has got the be THE ODD COUPLE, GRUMPY AND GRUMPIER OLD MEN, OUT TO SEA. The great True Story movie he made has got to be Tuesday's with Morrie. I thought that movie was brilliant. It makes me cry whenever i like to watch it, Morrie i think was a great person and he gave Mitch (A pupil he teached) a message, Telling him IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DIE, THEN YOU KNOW HOW TO LIVE. That will be a message to all of us. Thank you Jack, you were a fantastic, a great, true person who was kind, helpful and brilliant. GOD BLESS YOU.

As we turn into a totalitarian state, movies such as this remind me of a time when the people were taught History, when there was something called 'morality' in this nation with hypocrisy being so attached to it.As usual, Gardner and Jack Lemon show what great comedy actors can do, as they portray 2 ex presidents who are being hounded by an evil C.I.A. group bound to destroy them, one way or the other.The fact that they have representatives of actual Americans in this movie, being deprived of their livelihood because of the rush to 'globalization' of our jobs shows the true patriotism of the writers of this movie. Lemon is dead now, and many of us in the 60s remember when we were a country to be proud of.No longer. And this movie details it using comedy, just as airamericaradio does to show the corruption.

This time without Walter Matthau, of course. Enter James Garner, a fine actor. Unfortunately, in this film, both actors are in bad material. They play former Presidents who are framed and thrust into murder, deception and political sabotage.Dan Aykroyd makes a lackluster appearance as the current President who is found dealing in illegalities. Most pathetic however is John Heard, doing the worst Dan Quayle impersonation ever. Lauren Bacall, Sela Ward and Wilford Brimley are all wasted in this poor, poor comedy.

It had some funny moments, and some very contrived and false moments about the greatness of being president.  It could have been much better (and more suitable for younger viewers) if it the two presidents didn't spend most of their time swearing at each other and using foul humor.  (Also notice how every single person in this movie knows to properly refer to an ex-president.)Still, one line near the end, Don't worry sirs, it's just me, the twisted psychopath, almost made it worth it.

There are more bathroom jokes in this film than are needed, and its subject is treated so shabbily, it's hard to believe these guys ever made it into the Oval Office. To go with that, the supporting actors like Lauren Bacall, Wilford Brimley, Dan Ackroyd, and John Heard are completely wasted, sitting around wondering what to do. I will admit I did get a few chuckles and even a stray belly laugh out of this farce, but if they try for a sequel to this hogwash, I'm going to ask the video stores to burn it right there on the counter for all to see. Now that's better entertainment!

Everybody learns something valuable, good guys are good, bad guys are bad, and the ending is exactly what you'd expect.Jack Lemmon is decent in his role. Dan Ackroyd plays The Dan Ackroyd character, this time with an occasionally shifting Southern accent. James Garner was best cast and did the most with his character. His comedic timing was spot-on, particularly when one considers the weak material he worked with.I normally don't note special effects because I don't really care about them, but there's a scene with characters on horseback that is so unbelievably bad in execution that it might as well have been puppets. The bloopers on the DVD are worth watching, if only to get a sense of what it must be like to work with Lemmon and Garner. I found Garner's ability to maintain character impressive! But this is not a picture I need to see again.

I can't remember the last time I saw so many otherwise enjoyable actors rendered so much less fun to watch by incompetent direction and a mediocre script. The gimmick is that Lemmon and Garner are ex-Presidents, see, and Lemmon is the conservative who acts like a liberal and Garner is the liberal who acts like a conservative and they get stranded together and hijincks ensue and they learn important life lessons from their constituents and oh what the heck ever.I'm not saying it couldn't have been done well -- only that it wasn't in this case. Wag the Dog, Bob Roberts, The American President, and the real-life Presidency of George W. Bush are all superior efforts when it comes to relatively recent features that satirize the White House.

James Gardner and Jack Lemmon hate each other in this movie and gradually move on but in the process they refer to each other in terms like penis, d__khead sh__t ass it is just to vulgar. James Gardner is a former President as well as Jack Lemmom. James Gardner is a Democrat and Jack Lemmon is a Republican. James Gardner makes a deal with top Democrats to frame Jack Lemmon. Gardner thinks he will get party support to run as President again if he helps out in this frame up.Both end up being kidnapped and their life in danger.These guys are great actors and in their older years not bad. Jack Lemmon sounds very similar to Ronald Reagan when he speaks. What a waste of talent. "}]
