It seems that most of the stars of the 1940s did a few cheap-o independent films during the 1930s (Bogart and Cagney did a few that I recently reviewed). However, what sets this film apart is that despite its poor quality at times, it's a surprisingly watchable. So, if you ignore one or two flat performances by supporting cast members and sets that are not exactly MGM quality, you'll be rewarded with a decent film. Yes, I'll admit that the plot is just a little bit silly, but because of its charm and brisk pace, it satisfies. Cary plays a rich and lazy guy who finds himself bored with life. When he goes to the doctor, the doc tells him to stop sniveling about his life and DO something productive--get a job and stop being a self-indulgent jerk. Cary takes this as a challenge and decides to make himself over--all for the better. About the only strong negative I felt is that the girl that Cary is destined to marry in the film just seems awfully immature and stupid at the end of the film--I wanted him to find someone better!

Filmographies differ as to the precise order of the films he released in this period, so this film -- the only one he made in Britain in the '30's -- makes a convenient watershed. Of his films released that year, this one is probably the weakest.Cary at this point has his mature mannerisms, but he still lacks the sparkle. Moviegoers would have to wait another year. He really comes into his own in 1937 with The Toast of New York, Topper, and The Awful Truth in particular.This film's plot follows the conventional Depression formula of a man of affluence temporarily renouncing his wealth in order to become a man of the people, with predictable results.

There are a number of other, better movies made in the 1930s that were based on similar ideas, but this one is a solid feature. The main thing that keeps it from being better is that the story and script do not always make the best use of their opportunities. As a result, there are some sequences that take up screen time that could have been used for something better, while some potentially fine moments are under-emphasized.Grant plays a wealthy young man who has become jaded and spoiled by the company of other well-to-do idlers, and who sets out on a challenge to learn how to work for a living. This setup lends itself to a lot of good material, and the best moments are Grant's interactions with other everyday persons who don't know who he is.Within a very short time after this was filmed, Grant became one of the best actors around at handling this kind of material, and he was then able to make this kind of story work even when it wasn't particularly well-written. Here, there are a number of times when his developing flair shows through, but he wasn't quite experienced enough yet to carry the whole load, so there are some sequences that lack the spark that they needed in order to keep moving. It makes the movie somewhat uneven, still worth seeing if you like the era and genre, but otherwise unremarkable.

However, it is noteworthy as being the one and only film Cary Grant ever made in his native England for an English Studio.Grant plays Ernest Bliss, a wealthy London playboy with nothing to do but drink martini's in his posh west end club and wine and dine the female socialites of his class. Amazingly, he's still not a happy man, he's restless and short tempered and not knowing why, he visits the Harley Street Offices of Doctor Sir James Alroyd. (Peter Gawthorne). Sir James however, not only has his Harley Street practice, but is a great philanthropist who also helps the poorer people from the East End over come their ailments for little or no payment, and cannot disguise his visible contempt for Bliss.After examining Bliss he delivers his diagnosis to the shocked playboy, which turns out to be nothing more than a chronic case of boredom. He's bored because he's been spoilt and pampered all of his life without ever having to do a single thing for himself and hasn't anything constructive to do but live out his days spending his inheritance. Bliss in an attempt to prove there is more to him than what Sir James has said, bets him Â£50'000 that he can make an honest living for a whole year without touching any of his money for his own benefit.Incognito, Bliss sets off to the East End in an old suit and just enough money for the tube fare, but soon realises that his 'quest' is not as easy as he first thought. However, he also realises the strength and kindheartedness of the working classes. He's touched by the generosity of these people, good people who will give you what they have even though they haven't that much to give. Convinced that he is not using his money for HIS own benefit as his deal with Sir James stipulated, Bliss begins to use his inheritance to help these people out of certain situations, thus changing their lives for the better.As I mentioned earlier, it's not a great film but it's heart is certainly in the right place. and the movie is riddled with great and much missed British character actors/actresses of the 1930's and '40's. American Actress Mary Brian plays Frances Clayton, Grant's love interest.It such a shame that the movie runs just a little over an hour and has obviously been cut to shreds by a crazed studio editor somewhere, because there is/was an 80 minute print of this movie available at one time or another. So my 'amazing quest' is now to hunt down this elusive version if it still exists which sadly I doubt, as Empire Film Studios were never a major player in British movie making before or after the war. It's a genuine possibility that the original 80 minute print was destroyed in the blitz with only the 61 minute USA version still in existence. who knows?.Enjoy!!!

He doesn't work and he has nothing to do. He has never had to do anything constructive, and his life has become a bore. He doesn't know what to do to while away his time between evenings of partying. And he doesn't even enjoy the partying and night life.As many another person in his situation, he is unhappy. He can't enjoy all the things that his wealth can buy. He is empty, listless, unsatisfied. A friend recommends a doctor who can cure him. Sir James Alroyd (played by Peter Gawthorne) analyzes Bliss's problem in direct and unflattering terms. He suffers from selfish consumption, self-centeredness, a lack of empathy for the travails of others, and the compunction that follows. He couldn't even survive on his own for year.Thus begins the Amazing Adventure of Ernest Bliss. Over the next year, this silver spoon-fed spoiled millionaire must learn how to live. He must learn how to find work, even when there's no work to be found. He must learn to work and hunt, scrape and save, ask and beg &#x96; for work, for food, for a break, for a chance. In the course of his adventures and moving from one job and place to another, something amazing happens. He begins to identify with everyday people. His life transforms as he begins to care for others. Life has meaning. Life has purpose, if only to share with others or to help someone out of a tight spot. This film is an amazing story of one man's redemption &#x96; his rebirth. And Cary Grant plays the role to perfection. Not that we movie buffs should be surprised. Archibald Leach grew up poor in England, and mostly uneducated beyond age 14. While Grant is most remembered and loved for his many comedies and romantic roles, he was very talented as a dramatic actor as well. He proved it in a variety of roles he had interspersed with his comedy romances over the years. While his acting ability was never in question, some of those films were less than box office smashes. The public would allow him an occasional dramatic role, but for the most part, he had to play comedy and romance. In his leading man roles, he played opposite a host of Hollywood's best female stars of film over a period of four decades.This film had several actors in supporting roles, most of whom did very well in their brief scenes. The one exception is Mary Brian, as Frances Clayton. She had more time than the rest on film, but her role was stiff and wooden at times. As Bliss takes on his year of learning how to live, not all is so serious that we don't have some humor. We see that in a few lines in places, and in one scene toward the end.At one point, Bliss says to his banker, Oh, what's the different talking to you about love? The banker says, Very little, no doubt. But would a young lady disappear like this if there weren't some other interests? Bliss says, Nonsense! She loves me. She said so. I know she does. There's never been anybody else. After a pause, he resumes, She wouldn't do that! She couldn't do that! The bankers says, Whatever that may be, I'd rather fancy that is just what she has done.When Bliss begins his one-year quest without any ID or money, he tells his man/butler, Clowes (played by Quentin McPhearson) that he, Clowes, won't have anything to do for the next year in his job. He is to simply stay in Bliss's home and do nothing until his return. Bliss says, Now, don't tell anyone about it, Clowes. Clowes says, I quite understand. I won't say what happens to Clowes over the next months, but when all is resolved later, he says, Believe me sir, it was having no work made me go wrong. It was too hard a job having nothing to do at all. Bliss says, Of course it was. That used to be the trouble with me. When Bliss goes into the room to fetch his new bride, Frances, he finds her crying. Bliss says, Darling, you're crying. What's the matter, baby? Frances says, Cinderella didn't cry in the story. But she would have in real life. I'm too happy not to cry. Too happy.This is a wonderful story of one man's redemption, and how that touches the lives of many others. It is based on a book by prolific English novelist Edward Phillips Oppenheim. He wrote more than 100 novels from 1887 to 1941. But for the lesser quality of the film on my DVD, and the sub-par acting noted, it would earn 10 stars.

The simple story is that of a gentleman name of Ernest Bliss (Cary Grant) who due to his multi Millionaire status finds himself completely bored with his life. Unable to understand why, seeks the advice of Sir James Alroyd (Peter Gawthorne) a good friend and prominent doctor. The physician explains that Bliss is bored because he has money and too much leisure time on his hands.

At the former, he meets and begins to date pretty Mary Brian (as Frances Clayton).The quest Grant takes really isn't all that amazing, and the romantic subplot sluggishly (and obviously) carries the day. It might have been better to have Grant leave the doctor's office angry, and develop amnesia. He never really abandons the use of his money, as you'll see - though the script argues the point with a caveat.

Cary Grant was an indispensable pick as his retorts and witty alacrity add to the characters sulken quality.I think this kept Grant in good stead; it's not a lavish production or even an actual proficiently made one. But for what it's worth, you can get into the narrative and watch the way it unfolds. The crux is that it's about the mogul Ernest Bliss, who inherited fortune from his Father posthumously. Idle and fatigued, he seeks more life and from the aid of a psychologist he decides to go on hiatus from money for 12 months.Of course, in a way, this is a good allegory. Life is worth more then money. It may be a platitude but we get the essence of this from the help that Bliss bestows - he gets a business funded for Frances. In conflict with Clare and that (an unmitigated insignificant subplot), the idea behind Blisses assessment of love is somewhat superficial until the end I feel. At one point he utters Love is more then Money, which the psychologist finds insane. A little hypocritical? Trying to put him adrift in another path, yet still uncertain about how it works? I don't know.Though I do know that is Grant that holds up the foundation of the film in the enjoyment department, especially in the scene where two people find out he's that mogul, and they have a slapstick fight in the house.The film is limited in location shots, albeit it also uses cheap segues and effects. In a way another problem is that Bliss is smitten with a totally unlikable character who I adopted an aversion for after she straight up admitted to the fact she was avaricious. His chasm though is that of meaning, but hers is that of a compromised love. He has to help her and then becomes even more enamoured to her.This was made just a few years prior to Frank Capra's Mr Smith Goes to Washington, but it took a while for there to be a colossal film for Grant. It's not here, but you can explicate his character traits here - unceremonious and visceral to name a few. The story is stylised, the plot is heavy handedly handled and the tone is comical, so it's completely innocuous (unless you get offended by the shear synthesis of implausible love).It could be subjected to ample fan base material though, which may be favourable to it. But I have to admit I'm not impressed with the overall experience. Also there will be no qualms for the running time as it goes swimmingly and ends in a blink, though I find that to be insatiable. I quite like long films (La Roue, 1900, Barry Lyndon, Greed, Intolerance, Gone with the Wind, Andy Warhol etc.).

I was born shortly after WWII began (7th November 1939) and I recall a few things about war, chiefly trying clean my father's brass buttons on his RAF uniform - he was a flight engineer but also had air gunner and then observer/navigator badges. I sometimes think how life was like for him growing up in the 1930s and it was mostly a hard time as the film reflects as Cary Grant finds it hard to get a job. My father died relatively young and I as I had moved away from home - Pembrokeshire - by the time I began to think about asking him about his early life and later war time experiences, sadly, he was dead.I would like to have more detailed information on the film in terms of where it was shot - and if it was a British production - as it seems to be as the credits on the cheap DVD I got recently cite Empire Films - and the USofAmerica never formally claimed an empire although Bush currently is seeking to control the Western World and terrorise the rest-why Cary Grant appears in it. The 'mise en scene' reminds me very much of the Alfred Hitchcock Film, Blackmail, and thus I expected it to have been made much earlier - say 1931 - 32, as by 1936, filming had improved in terms of quality of visual presentation - in Go into your Dance, for example, there is a wonderful tracking shot across a bar/ dance hall/night club, as there is in Shall we Dance, when FA & GR enter the bar on the ship, so this film in comparison seems very badly shot in terms of camera technique and editing.The DVD I got seems to be of a 16mm print, as was on I got from Tescos on Second Chorus - however, there may be a better quality DVD available - but that can't save an overstretched storyline. However, it is interesting to see quasi socio-dramas like this to see how the film makers saw society and how the film going public liked to see themselves, perhaps. Most ordinarily people in the 1930s were lesser educated than today and probably very naive and complacent about their situations - in the scene where the old car mechanic gets the sack my automatic thought was, where is his union representative?I found it hard to get any information at all and took a long time to get to this website. I entered The Amazing Adventure into the AOL search engine and this particular film did not appear - so I have had to take a lengthy circuitous route to find what information you have. In contrast when I looked up Kevin Costner's Adventures of Robin Hood, I was able to get a lot of information, most interestingly about the places the film was shot, one being St Bartholemew's Church in SE London - and I intended to visit this as its interiors are very different from the more usual perpendicular style - but I have not yet got around to doing this.anyway, 'thank you for the information you have provided - which was much better than other sites.B.

The character that he plays, Ernest Bliss, is not an endearing character, but it does make Grant a local hero rather than a Hollywood hero. "}]
