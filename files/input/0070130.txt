[{"Title":"Putting the 'f' into arthouse.  (possible spoiler)","Date":"11 May 2000","Score":"57 out of 66 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The European arthouse movie, since the 50s at least, has been generally seen in opposition to Hollywood.  Instead of relying on cartoonish genre, broad comedy and loud, violent action, it supposedly offers analysis, detail, character, critique, context, civilised intelligence.  Crudely put, Hollywood appeals to the senses, European films to the mind. LA GRANDE BOUFFE is an almost archetypally European movie - a Franco-Italian co-production, directed by a noted auteur, Marco Ferreri, and starring arguably the three greatest of all European actors, Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli and Phillipe Noiret.  It features allusions to philosophy, art history and literature, and is confined, Bunuel-like, to the single set of a decaying town mansion.  It is also about four middle-aged men stuffing themselves to death, blocking toilets until they messily explode, and, er, breaking wind.Ferreri treats his theme of excess - food, sex, self-pity - with an almost Oriental restraint, matching lengthy, static long shots so dense with detail and so darkly lit that it's often difficult to make anything out, to extreme close-ups, pitilessly exposing yet also strangely moving a bit like Ozu filming Fellini.  It's hard to know how to recommend this film - and I do, very strongly.  Four professionals - a cook, a pilot, a TV producer and a judge - convene at the latter's unused mansion to spend a weekend non-stop eating a prodigiously elaborate feast made from the choicest meats many prospective meals are walking about in the garden.We gradually learn that they have come here to die, but Marcello is unable to continue without sex, so they hire some prostitutes, as well as inviting a local, seemingly innocent, teacher, who is soon revealed to have appetites equal to any of the men.  And so the men eat.  And eat.  And eat.  They sometimes have sex, watch antique 'erotic' slides, drive cars, get sick.  But mostly they eat.  They even have competitions to see who can eat the fastest.This, ironically, does not sound very appetising for the viewer.  There is no narrative drive for instance - any conflict possibly brought by the pure, innocent Andrea, a symbol of life in an atmosphere of decay, to whom Phillipe proposes marriage, are quickly dashed by her own taste for depravity.  The men decide to die, and we watch them do it.  The film begins with a methodical introduction to all four characters, and ends as methodically picking each one off.So what is the film about?  Is it an allegory - a group of fairly representative French bourgeois gathered in a knackered mansion with a sparse, dying garden, might suggest so.  But an allegory of what?  The decline of French masculinity, patriarchy, capitalism?  The judge and TV producer especially are examples of the most powerful, potentially corrupting forces in Western society, the law and the media.  The women all escape and survive, although the closing shot of Andrea returning to the home is highly ambiguous.BOUFFE is very Bunuellian, from the EXTERMINATING ANGEL-like idea of bourgeoisie trapped in a mansion (figured in the inability of Marcello to leave in his sportscar, doomed to drive up and down the avenue), to the profusion of animals, observing the men's descent into bestiality, as they grunt and hoot and growl, and become fatal slaves to their appetites.  Is it a study in decadence - there are many shots framed like grotesque parodies of Renaissance paintings; that optimistic project is flatulently shot here.  There are allusions made to both Boileau - the father of French neo-classicism - and Brillat-Savarin, whose Physiognomy of Taste is a famous combination of philosophy and gastronomy which the four men take to nihilistic limits.  Is it a death knell of film, as the parody of Don Corleone suggests, as four old men watch slides like a corruption of early cinema?I don't know.  But for me the pleasures were many.  The home itself, stuffed with so much bric-a-brac you can barely make out the characters.  The fragmentary motifs returning in the coolly formal style - the replaying of certain scenes and shots; the repetition of the inchoate, beautiful, yearning tango music, which is connected to one character but shifts as he becomes a ghost.  The museum of the dead culminating in the extraordinary, triangular shot of the sprawled Ugo, with Marcello and Michel behind him.  The limitless, ingenious, grotesque variations on sex and food.  The gross comedy.  The genius compositions.  The colours.  The sight of three actors who have starred in some of the 20th century's supreme artistic achievements running from faecal rivers, and putting the rump back into rumpo.

Ferreri's greatest achievement was making relentlessly intellectual films that also managed to entertain. While many other European directors could get caught up in their own genius, Marco Ferreri was never pretentious enough to forget about his audience.La Grande Bouffe is one of Ferreri's best and most notorious films. The premise is infamous, four friends gather at a country mansion with the intention of literally eating themselves to death. When this becomes tiresome they hire three prostitutes and invite the local school teacher to join them. This is not a film that follows a linear narrative, instead it expertly crafts a sense of atmosphere from a series of acutely observed vignettes. There are enough unforgettable images and surreal happenings in this film to make Salvador Dali green with envy. The meat garden, Andrea and Michel's flatulent love making and Philippe's relationship with his nanny are just three that come to mind. There is genius at work here, this is not an exercise in empty symbolism but a disturbing slice of modern life.The impact of La Grande Bouffe has not wearied with age. The sex scenes are possibly less confronting (although Marcello's inventive use of a champagne bottle still raises eyebrows) but the film's psychological impact has not been dulled. The characters' ruthless pursuit of death is all the more disturbing given their unadulterated appreciation for life's pleasures. For a film with such disturbing content, La Grande Bouffe is also effortlessly entertaining. Ferreri somehow manages to balance the building tension with black humour, raunchy sex scenes and even budding romance.This is probably a good time to mention the cast. Ferreri has gathered together a who's who of European cinema. Ferreri regulars like Mastroianni and Tognazzi combine brilliantly with French heavyweights like Piccoli and Noiret. Andrea Ferreol more than matches it with these acting giants. She deserves significant credit for her illuminating performance as the open minded school teacher with the appetite of a blue whale.La Grande Bouffe is intelligent, disturbing and unrelenting. Most importantly, it is also entirely non-judgemental. Ferreri would never insult his audience by suggesting to them what they should think. If only more modern directors had taken note.

Every key aspect of the western culture is present in this brilliant, surreal farce. The only ideology the men and the poor Andr√©a hold is one of hedonistic consumption of food and sex. The prostitutes are the sensible ones, leaving out of the game in time. They represent the outsiders, people who refuse to take part in the destructive lifestyle, and are saved.If you hate symbolism, you might watch this as a very funny and brilliantly acted comedy. If you don't mind the symbolism, every time you watch it again you'll find new depths in Ferreri's witty commentary of modern western lifestyle. Personally I don't mind it, hence 10/10. Belongs to my top 10 of all times. "},{"Title":"An extraordinary movie.

Instead of alcohol these dissatisfied men decide to kill themselves using food. Marcello Mastroianni is the best known of the four stars but Michel Piccoli (Belle De Jour), Ugo Tognazzi and and Philippe Noiret are equally impressive. The acting from all four is first rate and really makes the premise believable. Director Marco Ferreri went on to make the Bukowski adaptation 'Tales Of Ordinary Madness' another uncompromising, f*cked up and beautiful movie. I highly recommend both films which are difficult viewing, but worth the effort.

Very few things connect with reality here, thanks also to the stunning locations, dec√≤r and photography. Philippe's house is one of the best sets I ever saw.

Each character has their own traits and different ways of exiting life. Prostitutes come and go yet a female school teacher decides to join the horde until the very end.Sadean to the core, without the pessimism, their hedonistic lifestyles continue until their bodies (or mind) can no longer take it.A satire of course, but given the time it was filmed can probably be looked at in a few ways. Three of the four characters greatly enjoyed their time even when facing death. Half expecting to see them have a revelation or biting realization on life, instead they continued on the same path. Kind of hard to have a satire without some sort of tragic ending or change in plans of the patronized characters.Not a masterpiece but worth seeing. The film is even strangely erotic. I don't think it comes together as a full fledged mock of society either. I dare one male to deny he would not enjoy a weekend at a retreat such as this.

I was a little wary of La grande bouffe, though I had always wanted to see it. I've always been drawn to stories where a group of people (or more usually a couple) lock themselves up together and slowly kill themselves, or screw each others brains out. In this film, four men (Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli, Philippe Noiret and Ugo Tognazzi, all playing characters who use the actors' real first names) come together in a palatial estate to screw prostitutes and eat themselves to death. No real reason is given. The prostitutes don't make it very long. The constant feasting disgusts them, and they leave. The only woman who does stay is a Reubenesque teacher named Andrea (Andrea Ferreol), who is intrigued by both the food and sex (unlike the other women, the idea of food and sex together turns her on). This movie is a tad too slow. At it's best, though, it's fascinating and hilariously gross. Food seems quite unappetizing after about a half hour of this. I loved the performances. Definitely of interest.

Their erotic gorging, groping and fondling of food and flesh is both appetising and arresting, as one by one, they stuff themselves to morbidity. It's with a tinge of sadness that their food fornication gradually comes to a halt, when the last man can no longer brook another chocolate pudding or roast pig.Those who appreciate gourmet cooking might find appeal in the vast menu, but will likely be shocked by the flatulence-passing, naked-backside food preparation techniques of these randy chefs. The cast periodically combine their appetite for food with unbridled sexual encounters while they prepare meals, to which the viewer is treated in full detail. But while the sets, costumes and dialogue are all, equally colourful, there's a distinct lack of momentum and coherent storyline in the near two-and-a-half hour epic. I submit, respectfully, there's only so many kitchen orgies one film can sustain (particularly as this isn't a loop) without a more concrete purpose.The cast are formidable in their distinct characterisations (and appetites), and it seems as though each has resigned to his own despair at a life unfulfilled. While Mastroianni does little cooking by comparison with Piccoli, he more than compensates with his sexual appetite at any number of the prostitutes assembled for their last supper. Le Grande Bouffe is a raw, uncompromising comedy like no other and should be seen to be believed.

For that matter we could also ask why actors of the calibre of Philippe Noiret, Michel Piccoli, Ugo Tognazzi and Marcello Mastroianni thought this was a career enhancer.

Another fact -that all of the four personages are named the same as the actors,leads to the thought,that the actors and the director Marco Ferreri divided the same fillings on a subject of modern hight society,its eternal chasing after satisfactory which does not have limits include moral,and inability to get away of it. Like in another Ferreri movies,here there is no need to think,just to follow,and understanding will come. The picture is very good example for different cinema,although the one plus four biggest stars of the Europe and for my opinion of the world.

I remembered the humour and the surreal touches as well as the excellent performances from Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli and Phillippe Noiret but was surprised at the sensational and pivotal performance from the delightfully plump, Andrea Ferreol. The guys have arranged a giant eating session, later spiced up with the ordering of three prostitutes as we come to realise that their intention is to eat and f*** themselves to death. Andrea plays the 'innocent' local school teacher, also roped in and it is she who ends up showing the rest a thing or two. It is a marvellous, sexy and invigorating performance amidst the disgusting surroundings of gluttonous eating mixed with vomit and s**t. Not an easy view, I'm not even sure to whom I might recommend it. A restaurant critic perhaps!

This leads to gastronomical problems with excess flatulence. Also, the judge is in love with the teacher and wants to marry her, but doesn't mind that she sleeps with the other three fellows.

It's the cynicism used against the great value of life, the spirit. These 4 people and the women involved are figures, most respected in our society. From captains to judges, to teachers and dancers, all these people seem to turn exclusively to flesh, ignoring the values of the mind and thought, as it were completely unimportant!Are they right, or wrong? They don't care, nor the audience. What it matters the most is the way it's done rather the cause of it. The food and sex, both represent the ultimate good in life, the birth and as it is used to provoke death, seems to become a great innovative aspect of sin which rarely has been used elsewhere (also represented in a Greek film called tempelides of Eforis koiladas)Finally if we must wonder ourselves the reasons this suicide is meant to be committed, we must first answer to our own reasons for living! Why are continue supporting a social system which is based in violent survival hunting? Why we categorise life as ethical and unethical and most important why every action we take is good or evil?Death as life are so pointless, equally to mind and flesh.

Beautiful cinematography,and a lecherous show.It kind of grows on you,the more you think about it,the more you analyze it.Marco Ferreri was a master;in showing sexuality,some directors are constipated, banal and ridiculously solemn (Bertolucci,even ...Antonioni);others are concupiscent (Brass);Marco Ferreri avoids both traps.The characters are accurately molded.Mastroianni is handsome and well-dressed.La Grande ... is a highly esteemed,far-famed,very acclaimed fetish,its reputation always precedes it.I must admit I expected something better;one of the movie's main strengths is the cast,although La Grande ... in no way can be called a Mastroianni,or a Tognazzi,or a Noiret film.(I do not regard it as an actor-movie,although the acting is flawless;it is certainly an auteur-movie.Not especially for those who want a Mastroianni movie,or a Tognazzi movie,but for those who look for a Marco Ferreri movie.I will not treat it,here,as a Mastroianni/ Tognazzi/Noiret/Mrs. Ferreol movie.Marco Ferreri uses them as a quintet,or as a five-heads monster)It is a dejected flick about excess, dehumanization, dementia,uncouthness,etc.,very a la Bataille/Blanchot.The excess is a Sade/Bataille/Blanchot/Baudrillard theme,taken over by Pasolini,etc..The treatment of this theme here succeeds in giving a grim,sardonic,sensual show,and a Marxist digression.(My mother,with whom I watch and/or discuss many movies,strongly dislikes both Piccoli and Noiret;she considers the later precious,ridiculous and affected.Anyway,Noiret performs richly in La Grande ....)

Well,it could have been done much better.In fact,few people even in the Western world afford&allow themselves to indulge with such delicacies, the most expensive champagne. It is therefore a criticism of capitalism not as it really is,but as it is wrongfully depicted in some Communist propaganda about Western decadence.Note that the events in the film must take place , in the year 1972 or 1973,because its characters know The GodfatherPart one.This means the affluent society just before the Oil Crisis put an abrupt ending to the almost thirty years of relentless economical growth after 1945.So,realesed in 1973,the subject would have already been dated.It would have been much better if Ferreri would have made this film in the 80's,because it fits the materialistic credo of the following decade.The idea of the middle-aged man contemplating suicide was well used in films ranging from The Waltz of the Toreadors to Scent of a Woman.Here the suicide pact between four quite wealthy middle-aged men is just unrealistic,especially if there is no logical reason,no plan,no actual pact.Only one character has diabetes and he dies in the most quick and painless manner by eating an entire cake and then passing away as if he fell asleep,as if he wanted desperately to convince the audience that he's dead,when not only the actor but even the character seem to fake it(death of course).But we know nothing more of his ailment and if this is the actual reason. Nor do we know why the other three are doing this.Mastroianni should have stuck to La Dolce Vita,there his character experiences another kind of death and suicide,not physically,slowly defeated by a pleasure-seeking society.This part was the criticism of consumerism without graphic violence,vulgarity,physical signs of pain.But in this film,also being called Marcello,like in Fellini's masterpiece,his part is becoming a tasteless copy of his former part,another,more fleshy Marcello.The death scenes are more of an insult to intelligence rather than disturbing.The viewer is supposed to believe that the four deaths are plausible,if a doctor or even a person without medical knowledge can tell that neither of the characters could die in real life like they did here.They seem to know far too good when exactly they are going to die to be for real!Besides,in every thorough scientific analysis of the symptoms before and in the moment they died it is clear that the cause of their death is just a big deceit.Praised for its divinely decadent mood,this very mood is rather shabby. The villa which is supposed to be a gateway into the decadent verse,of luxury,of vintage class&style looks awfully tasteless and unimaginative,a sterile visual experience completed by a bunch of underfed,dirty poultry running around.And the Bugatti that just drives back and forth without advancing,in a surreal way of defying the laws of mechanics and the very mission of even the worst car,when it should be a fast vehicle.A hint at Isadora Duncan's death?Or just a symbol for the fact the pact once made,trough some incredulous,inexplicable and unrealistic laws of destiny no one will leave the house alive?The food which also serves as suicide weapon is understated and rather unappetizing,though expensive compared to the real French-Italian gourmet cuisine.The literary symbols are also out of placethis film should be a modern Satyricon,but it lacks the picturesque style of the Roman masterpiece,the Godfather-imitation is too anecdotal and superficial and Boileau's oak and its story are completely redundant in the plot line,because the hint that Boileau's world of classical harmony is dead in our postmodern times is a too obvious truism.The spectacular factor of Satyricon-style banquets is also lacking.The film should be a warning against the mortal sin of gluttony. Actually it is both pathetic and deprived of any realistic expression or emotion,because a real-life French or Italian gourmet would relish all these foods and many more without dying,without even getting sick.Ironically,only hours after I saw the film I also embarked on a weekend of lavish eating and drinking in a secluded mountain villa with my friends and,almost needless to say,after having consumed similar quantities none of us dies or even got sick,lol!-of course there was no suicide pact in our case.No exceeding excess(though made in the materialistic eighties,years of overspending,the same film would have had another message and such quantities of food would not have been used for dying,rather as a status symbol or even a psychotherapy in favor of living).It fails to condemn materialism because neither its temptations are shown as appealing or sinful(and even less as deadly)nor is death due to them the slightest bit possible in real life,and also failing to bear any lessons against excessive greed.One ends up pitying not the basic needs and vices of the characters,nor their low morality,rather their immense tastelessness(even in death)and their unimaginative behavior exhaling mediocrity,essentially non-intellectual though their are supposed to be educated.The parallel between food and the forces of life and death,of eroticism and passion is key element in films ranging from the tragic Como l'Agua para chocolate(where food and recipes are present in the most disturbing and intense moments of the character's doom)up to that forgettable pseudo-entertainment called Woman on top.In this film it was just misplaced and misused.Much more convincing films about how consumerism and the promise of material happiness in a shallow,ruthless society have a crippling impact on the individual,but not necessarily trough food and suicide pacts,like Blow-up,La Dolce vita,Clockwork Orange,Scarface,Citizen Kane,Wall Street or American Beauty-in all this masterpieces the characters are undergoing their own suicide without knowing,being dragged in the downward spiral of greed much more complex than for food,they may or may not be wiped out physically,but always(and in the long run much more painful)innerly.This film,on the other hand,where even the four deaths fail to be credible,is a shame,but fortunately an exception in the usually so artistically accomplished,so flawless European cinema.
