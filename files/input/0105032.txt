Gone are all the pitiful sentimental demonstrations of future films like  Philadelphia . In fact, AIDS is merely the backdrop of the film. Cyril Collard never asks for  pity. The movie is both a confession and an hymn to life. It doesn't try to moralize the  audience, although some spectators were concerned about the message such a film might  send. You have to remember that the events described in LNF take place in 1986, when the  concept of HIV and AIDS were still abstract and to be defined. Collard himself said in a 1992  interview that the irresponsability of his character, Jean, having unprotected sex although  aware he is infected, would be rightly considered criminal by now. The virus serves as a  driving force for a main character that is learning to love, opening himself to others, to the  world. But to reach the light, you must first go through the darkness and the task is not an  easy one to witness. LNF demands a lot on the viewer, asking him to let go of his preconceive  ideas and ideals. Very much influenced by his mentor Maurice Pialat, Collard makes a daring  film, one which you could never imagine coming from the all too clean world of Hollywood  film making. Here, energy comes first, technical aspects of movie making later. Therefore  life, real life, shines through. Les nuits fauves is a force to be reckon with. An unsettling  experience I will never forget.

This picture is an invaluable reference for all those trying to understand terminal disease -AIDS in particular- or in the process of facing death. Just seems important to mention that Collard's actual treatments were filmed and included on the final cut. The bouncing around of high-low's, from absolute certainty of overcoming the disease to deep depression and sending everything -love included- straight to hell. But also the dangerous and sometimes silly sense of humor with which the director plays his role, is what makes this movie invaluable to me. To my knowledge this is the first film in which HIV positive blood is used as a defensive weapon, and saves the life of two of the characters. I sincerely hope that there is some form of afterlife, and that they have cable.

The director, writer and main character of the film died just three days before his film swept the Caesars(the Oscar's french counterpart).  Collard died of AIDS and brought to life one of the most compelling films surrounding this theme.  It is not just people whining because of the departure of the beloved one but a tour de force involving hatred, passion, self destruction, and all those nice feelings that accompany a person who knows that he will die sooner than the rest, and culminating in spiritual redemption.  This film also portrays one of the finest love triangles on film; the at times sickening at times profoundly erotic and at times inevitably cathartic relationship between Jean and his two lovers is a genius example that love is not Sleepless in Seattle.  Romane Bohringer(probably best known for her character as Verlaine's wife in Total Eclipse) is a must see in her breakthrough performance as a confused and VERY passionate young girl.

Stories about the HIV/AIDS epidemic and they're coming in the thousands right after brilliant documentary How To Survive a Plague, the stream continued with Dallas Buyers Club, Behind the Candelabra, and the upcoming adaptation of The Normal Heart. They're all heroic, real and influential tellings and they're getting a lot of praise from everybody. Meanwhile, I took the time to look back at the time machine and search for works that were released back in the nightmarish days when the plague was a horrific death sentence and a theme barely touched on the screen. Among those, Les Nuits Fauves (Savage Nights) is one that needs to receive a special attention. It's unlike any of the fore-mentioned titles, it's daring at the same time it's unpleasant, careless, controversial, and it's a different take from almost all the other films of the period. This is the anti-Philadelphia - I make this comparison because they were released very next to each other (the same year in most countries).What you're about to see was a real story, fictionalized at times but real. Its writer, director and main star Cyril Collard exposes a dark truth that frightens, revolts and angers, but he was being truth to himself and to the public. First, with his 1986 novel of same name and then by making this adaptation, huge risks in presenting his story about Jean, a HIV positive cinematographer wanna be director who refuses to deal with his condition, still living a hedonistic and wild life of parties, drugs and sex with both men and women. We focus on two of his lovers the 17 year-old Laura (Rohmane Bohringer), naive and impressionable enough to fall in love with him; and the rugby player Sami (Carlos LÃ³pez), bisexual just like Jean, but they're more into the attraction part than dealing with a love/hate kind of thing. Torn between these two and also with casual sex encounters with strangers under a Parisian bridge, Jean ignores his disease living as if things never changed, deeply knowing that he is changing, getting affected more and more each day goes by. Everything's resumed into knowing that he's alive and kicking and there's some time to be enjoyed before death. But don't be fooled. Savage Nights is pain after pain, pleasure is very limited. The relation with Sami is a pure escapism since most of the time he's committed with girls and finding time to be join a racist/homophobic group, beating up people like Jean, where he can release his frustration of not living the same way he did with his criminal father back in Spain; the love affair with Laura is a constant headache, mostly because she doesn't handle well the fact that Jean likes guys (and she knows about Sami). It gets worse when Jean reveals that he's HIV positive and she might be as well because they had unprotected sexual relations. His excuse for not saying it before is unreasonable yet believable (and probably used by many folks out there) he thought she'd never get AIDS because their love is strong and overcomes anything, even a deadly virus. It's the greatest and most difficult scene of the film, and some will focus their anger and hate not on the character but on Collard. I appreciated the film because Collard has given a different perspective on a delicate theme at the time, had a lot of nerve in telling his story (but not necessarily a full factual retelling, there's rumors that the story ended differently for the real girl who inspired Laura) and despite the obstacles faced with his new reality, finding ways to see life with some optimism, grasping to it with the few strength he has and seeing it a little differently. Sure, he's still careless about others and himself, always putting his feelings above the others, including family and friends but now he can truly say he loves his life. Sickness feels less important, the complete opposite of what happens in similar themed films where you see characters slowly succumbing to the disease, which is always on the foreground, preventing them to do anything about it. Collard's adaptation of his own novel doesn't betray his source, though he left out great sequences - the one in Morocco is reduced to bits and pieces, but it was poetic translated in surreal scenes - but the way he conducted its transformation to the screen was very good, small chapters and fragments of a full speeding life that runs towards the inevitable end that never seems to actually feel it. It's a circle of parties, drugs, sex, wild nights, fights and risky business in a city whose corners seems to invite all of those at any given moment.But what's wrong with Savage Nights? It's lack of focus in the disease's progress. The character forgets about his problems and still lives his life but in terms of reality the disease becomes overlooked when it shouldn't. But forget that. What about his message to audiences? I'm positively sure that Collard was simply telling his own story without endorsing or condemning his actions - though anyone else can get easily confused with everything presented there. Let people figure out for themselves. That's what happened but it wasn't very helpful since many critics reacted badly with the movie, others praised it, and the man hasn't lived enough to expose his thoughts, dying a few days earlier of the rain of awards at the Cesar. The enigma stays on with this film testament, who was he and how to describe him and his acts? Rebellious, honest, sickening, hateful, fearless? Hero or villain?

Does that mean the film is automatically bad? No,however...The film contains too many unfocused scenes of characters lashing out. By the fourth or fifth scene of the young female protagonist screaming on the phone, screaming in the street, screaming at the door of the apartment, it becomes overdetermined. The film tries to tackle too many subjects--sadomasochism, skinheads, internalized homophobia, bisexuality, AIDS and responsibility, teenage love... it ends up something of a hot mess. I gave it six out of ten because I feel that it is worth seeing, because it captures a certain zeitgeist of the pre-antiretroviral moment, but one does feel a bit on watching it today that it has not aged all that well.

For a start, the depiction of ambisexuality is quite sincere, showing the suffering this ambiguous sexual behavior (considered an orientation, in spite of its apparent lack of direction) brings to people really involved or in love with the so-called bisexual entity who feels attracted to both men and women. The motion picture is not fiction or a bad joke, but mainly facts based on Cyril Collard's own life, who infected the woman he was involved with (played here by Romane Bohringer), knowing he was HIV-positive. First came the revelation through the novel of the same title, and then the film, in which he played his own part because no French actor even considered to play it, finding it too risky for their careers. Collard plays himself apparently as he was a vain, irresponsible, hedonistic strong case of satyriasis (the male counterpart for female erotic mania), and thanks for his daring to show his lifestyle, his passions and his mistakes, at least he left a starting point for open-minded partners to discuss a subject that may be affecting their relationships. It is a film as hard and bleak as Wong Kar-Wai's Happy Together, but both are necessary. There is time for To Wong Foo and for Priscilla, Queen of the Desert; there is even time for explicitness. But there should be also time for putting moralistic judgment aside, and watch and talk about dramas that show aspects of our condition that we tend to trivialize or deny, and that may make unhappy the persons we love. Five days after Cyril Collard died, Les nuits fauves won the CÃ©sar (France's top film prize) for Best Film, Best First Work, Best Film Editing and Best Female Newcomer (Miss Bohringer, who three years later played again the victim of two men in love Leonardo DiCaprio and David Thewlis, as Rimbaud and Verlaine, in Total Eclipse).

The central character Jean (Cyril Collard) a hedonistic young film producer who engages in sex with both men and women mirrors the real life story of Cyril Collard who was suffering from the AIDS virus during the making of this film and succumbed to it when the film was finished.  This is a great shame because obviously Cyril Collard has lots of talent both as actor and producer, and had he lived we could have enjoyed a whole lot of top quality films. This film starts on a quiet note but gathers strength after Jean reveals he is suffering from AIDS.  His girl friend Laura is shocked at the revelation as they had been engaged in unprotected sex.  Wild scenes of erratic and uncontrolled behaviour indicate the frustrations of the couple.  His outburst I don't want to die! is a high point and her constant appeal to him to give up his male contacts bears little fruit. Help me to leave you! is her pathetic cry. Cyril Collard has a great charm and infectious smile which he uses to advantage in his characterisation of Jean.  It is a powerful drama with a constant feeling of desperation as we the viewers anticipate the fatal outcome.  Not a film to cheer you up after a hard day, but it has a frightening authenticity about it which compels you to watch it to the end.  The film clearly makes the point that we have a responsibility re the health of others beyond our own self satisfaction.

Technically it is competent rather than outstanding, yet there are some  scenes that have been arranged beautifully.  However, the true magic in this film lies in its restricted narrative.  All emotions are allowed to express themselves freely.  The shots are relentless in their gaze.  Collard's character makes the choice to live and to love, within the context of what life has in store for him. Where some cinema pontificates and emotionally rapes the audience, this film priviliges the viewer.   We see non-hegemonic cinematic bravery and an engagement with freedom, and how that leaves one raw and damaged.  Yet each day alive is a gift.  We are fortunate indeed to share Collard's gift within this film and I urge those who have not seen it to do so.

As is often the case with Europics, especially French films, this movie is not so much a story as it is a study of behavior. In this case the behavior is of interest because the male lead, who really was HIV+ and died from AIDS at age 35, continues to lead a life of promiscuity in spite of his affliction, wrestling with his awareness of his disease, his inability to reconcile himself to his fate, and the temptations represented by his love interest and sexual partners. Unfortunately, Savage Nights is a journeyman film at best which grows tedious quickly as it gets wound up in its own confused emotions. However, it does have a sort of intriguing honesty about it and rejects the pity which is so often a part of films about people with HIV.

The star, writer, director Cyril Collard has Aids and knows he is dying when making the film. He storms and rages against the forces of negativity and affirms life in ways that seem obscene to many, but really focus on the basics of life, love and the willingness to actually live your life, even knowing that you are about to die. To quote Dylan Thomas, He rages against the dying of the night. This is not a gloomy film, except for the immense talent that Collard has in a number of areas, not the least writing and directing. The tragedy is that his libertine life of reckless homosexuality killed him (and many others). Unlike Philadelphia, an artifice of politically correct, maudlin nonsense, this film has Aids sometimes right in your face and sometimes in the background, but it is always there. Hedonism killed many and still does in the Aids epidemic and in the U.S.A., this film would attract few positive reviews and almost no distribution because Collard refuses to play the victim game. Over 80% of Aids deaths have been caused by homosexual behavior. In the film Collard can't control his impulses and because of Aids he wants to squeeze as much out of life as he can. The love story with Laura, beautifully played by Romane Bohringer, is tragic in and of itself, but their love is fatally compromised by his disease. Collard desperately wanted to live his life with Aids and not have Aids run his life. Unfortunately, that is impossible, although he gives it a mighty effort to free himself from thoughts of death, which never really leave him. He continues to have grimy homosexual encounters, supposedly not involving dangerous sex (at least in the film); my surmise is that in real life he lived dangerously right up to the end. When he has sex with Laura the first time, he doesn't use a condom and doesn't tell her he has Aids--a classic kind of denial, an attempt to conquer the disease through action , which is selfish. Many homosexuals will see this film, which other scenes do not really show them in a positive light, as a film to suppress. Reckless behavior has volcanoed in the last few years, but gets no publicity because of the left-wing press who refuses to see Aids victims as anything but victims, who didn't really cause their disease. Collard's film slaps the faces of hypocrisy and lying about Aids again and again in this film. It is a testimony to his will to live and to make a film that doesn't cover up the reality of how Aids is spread and how little impulse control many gays have. Drugs will not stop Aids deaths, safe sex and sometimes no sex will. Also, and very important, Collard wants to show that the heterosexual relationship with a loving woman is the way to live your life, but for him his refusal to control his impulses and perhaps his genetic inability to control them (though that is difficult to infer), keeps him from what would have saved him. Hedonism is not spat on in this movie, but its terrible results in many cases are exemplified in the tragic death of such a talented and lovely man.
