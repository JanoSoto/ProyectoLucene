[{"Title":"One of the sweetest movies I've ever seen!","Date":"9 July 2002","Score":"86 out of 100 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  No contest, I will say this marks the best of the Farrelly Brothers.  Not because this film is laugh-out-loud funny--it's funny, but not hilarious--but because it has a great heart and delivers a beautiful message without any corny Hollywood pretentions.  Sure, the premise is funny--a shallow guy gets virtually hypnotized into thinking all the unattractive women he sees are foxes and ends up going out with a 500-pound woman who he also thinks is a fox.  It's a great premise, but the Farrellys don't fixate on that premise alone, preventing it from turning it into a lame, one-joke slapstick comedy.  This is a comedy with heart--a rare finding.  In between laughs, you really get wrapped up in the characters and storyline.  The gags flow quite naturally, without the Farrellys forcing any humor onto the screen.  If a comic opportunity comes along, they take advantage, but there's no random acts of slapstick.I am pleasantly surprised with Jack Black, who has proved in this movie that he doesn't only have what it takes as a comic actor, but also as a serious actor and a romantic lead.  I've always enjoyed seeing him on screen, but he usually plays the same wound-up, hyperkinetic characters.  Basically, he's funny, but you still know you're watching Jack Black on screen.  This time he exercises his ability as a method actor, he succeeds well.  Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and sweet, capturing the audience's sympathy with her winning smile.  Joe Viterelli is amusing as her overweight Irish father, and actually pulls off a fairly convincing Irish accent.  The sizzling hot Brooke Burns makes a few appearances.  And Jason Alexander is always a joy to watch.I think Shallow Hal does the best job at conveying the message that beauty is on the inside.  It has been conveyed before in films like The Nutty Professor, but I feel this film conveyed it best.  This could've easily been a 105-minute fat joke, but it doesn't travel that route.  There are no crude or mean-spirited gags.  Could it be that the Farrelly Brothers matured?  Even of the films of theirs that I liked (ex.  Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) are a little uneven and contain a few gags that are just plain cruel.  Like in Mary, Cameron Diaz's brother is mentally ill and the butt of a few jokes.  Here, we have a character that walks on both his arms and legs, but he's portrayed as a normal character, and not as a gimmick for some cheap laughs.  There are moments that really tugged at my heartstrings.  The burn victim scene brought quite a few tears to my eyes.  The story is solid, with no boring lulls.  And the soundtrack is pretty good--I have criticized the Farrellys in the past for using crappy music in their sountracks.If you're looking for a good romantic/date movie with some good laughs and a good message, Shallow Hal will be an absolute delight.My score  8 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"This movie is very funny.","Date":"11 September 2003","Score":"85 out of 110 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  I loved this movie and thought Jack Black was at his best in it.  He carried the whole movie along with Gwyneth Paltrow and they both did an excellent job filling roles unlike any they have done before.  Many people will like this non traditional comedy that has a strong moral message.  If you are someone who enjoys a lighthearted meaningful story than definitely see this movie.  Don't be fooled by reviews that say it makes fun of overweight people (only) because it's message is that size doesn't and shouldn't matter. Yes, the main characters are shallow and say some awful things, but their main purpose is to represent those of us who need to change the way we view and treat other human beings.  I've always like Jack Black as a comedian but never pictured him as a boyfriend character until seeing this movie.  He was able to transform the very shallow unappealing Hal into a very likeable person. See it for Gwyneth if anything, she is very cute in it.

I always liked the Farelly Brothers's movies because while hilarious, they always had an underlying sweetness to them.  I think this one prevailed the most in that department-  I think 'Shallow Hal' is an incredibly sweet, and even more upon second viewing, just a charming, great movie-watching experience.  I think if people give it another chance and cut it some slack in the non-stop jokes department, they will see it for the great, enjoyable movie with a message that it really is.

If you do, you're shallow and that's the message played out in this comedy. The humor in here is good, very funny in spots. There are plenty of jokes and sight gags. If you are obese and very sensitive, then skip this film because you won't appreciate some of the humor in this film. But, if you can laugh at yourself, you'll enjoy it too - and especially the message this film brings.Jack Black was pretty much of an unknown actor when this came out, but he's well-known now after School Of Rock, King Kong and other films. Gwyneth Paltrow everyone knows. She looked very pretty in here, maybe the best I've ever seen her. Jason Alexander and Joe Viterelli provide good supporting help. By the way, it was strange hearing Viterelli with an Irish accent. This is a guy who almost always plays Mafia types.The only thing offensive to me was the beginning with some irreverent humor that was not needed, not part of the story, just a cheap shot against ministers. Also, for a lightweight comedy, the profanity could have been less. Can't someone make a modern-day comedy without language and sex issues? I wish someone would at least try. It can be done - just look at the classics!Anyway, this is still a pretty funny story with, of course, a good message about judging a book by its cover.

Black and Paltrow were great and Jason Alexander was hilarious.  The movie is about a guy named Hal who is a rather decent guy, but he has a problem.  When picking women he only looks at the outer beauty of a woman...this is explained in the opening scene.  Hal gets trapped in an elevator with a guy who opens Hal's mind to the inner beauty of women.  Hal then suddenly finds the more unattractive girls perfect for him and this leads to some funny scenes.  This also leads him to Rose Mary a gal he finds perfect, but everyone else sees a 300lb gal.  This movie says a lot about how shallow our society is and does a good job of it.  Though I don't think every unattractive or fat gal is beautiful on the inside and every attractive gal is ugly on the inside as the movie implies.  The movie also could have been more clear that people Hal already knows would still look the same.  I just wish ladies were as open and approachable as the movie portrays.

If you have a girlfriend or S.O. of another designation who has self-esteem issues, sit down with her and introduce her to this movie. I can't recommend it enough. It's the kind of romantic comedy that you can both enjoy evenly, without one of you or the other gritting their teeth and trying to make it look like a smile. Yes, it shows people being shallow, callous, and sometimes mean, but it also portrays some of those same people growing, maturing, and taking on depth. The casting is great. Gwyneth Paltrow is cute and sweet, and Jack Black walks the line between comedic goofball and serious romantic very well. Sure, there's a predictable happy ending, but the most popular romance stories tend to have that in common. Romeo and Juliet isn't everyone's cup of chai, after all. There are laughs, but this movie has heart, too. 10 out of 10. Both thumbs way up.

I wasn't too thrilled with There's Something About Mary after all the hyped reviews, I was thinking that their other movies would be like that. Especially with the touchy subject of obesity in our world that usually big people are not attractive, making it into a comedy is tricky. But somehow I really loved Shallow Hal. Even though it was a bit hypocritical, it's still really funny and I think it's mainly due to the cast. Jack Black made for a great male lead going from a total jerk into someone that the audience absolutely adored in the end.Hal, a superficial man, and his equally shallow friend Mauricio, share an interest in beautiful women, and try to act cool and hip when around them, but most women find them obnoxious and want nothing to do with them. Hal wants to see women for their inner beauty, but his fixation on physical beauty gets in the way. By a twist of fate, Hal meets the famous American life coach Tony Robbins while stuck in an elevator. Robbins, understanding Hal's situation, hypnotizes him into seeing people's inner beauty, not their external selves. Subsequently Hal meets and is smitten by Rosemary, the daughter of his boss. Rosemary appears to him as slender and beautiful due to her kind, generous nature, but is, in actuality, morbidly obese. Rosemary, who is used to being overlooked by men due to her appearance, initially interprets Hal's interest in her as mocking and insulting, but later realizes his feelings for her are genuine. Mauricio becomes worried about Hal's new taste in women, especially when he finds Hal is in a relationship with Rosemary. One night, while Hal is on a date with Rosemary, Mauricio catches him and says the trigger phrase, Shallow Hal wants a gal, which breaks Hal's hypnosis. Now Hal has to learn on his own that the woman that he loves may not have been all that in the looks department, but is everything that he actually wants in a woman.My main problem with Shallow Hal is it's shallow message, unfortunately Hal, if he wasn't hypnotized, would have never gone for a girl like Rosemary. Even though he learns his lesson, not every shallow man or woman is going to be hypnotized into seeing what true beauty is. But there are some really great laughs that Shallow Hal provides, it's also just a heart warming romantic comedy. It's something different and the cast really made up for what could have been a disastrous movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind to a different kind of comedy with some good laughs.7/10 "},{"Title":"Reinforcing stereotypes","Date":"5 February 2005","Score":"20 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" I could not stop watching this film because I was desperate to know exactly how the Farrelly brothers could possibly get themselves out of the huge pit they had dug for themselves. This film claims to be challenging what is considered beautiful in our society. In one section a character expresses the moral heart of the film by saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and by suggesting that we are hypnotised into believing what is and is not beautiful by the media etc. Fair enough! However, all representations of inner beauty are portrayed in clichéd and predictable stereotypes of female beauty in exactly the same way you would find in any Hollywood blockbuster. Thus, the film reinforces the same notions of beauty that it claims it is trying to undermine. Also, all fat people are not nice with a good sense of humour, this is as HUGE stereotype. I am fat, unpleasant and not funny.

The movie kind of does that to itself-though the theme here is everybodys' beautiful etc etc and meant to look at how much women are judged by their looks, the movie wasn't as bold as it could have been. If it REALLY wanted to take hold of this issue there would have been more of the heavy paltrow not just a few quick shots. Shows the thin paltrow a lot more and it shouldn't. Does anyone get the feeling the movie was almost afraid of it's own subject matter? That's what takes the oomph out of the movie and makes it a sweet little picture rather then an outstanding film. Still, it's OK-I know many people, both heavy and thin who saw this, most were not offended by the picture but had the movie aimed for serious movie making instead of predictable Hollywood fare(the former would have been more appropriate for the subject matter at hand) the movie would have been a lot better.

I was hugely disappointed in it for a long while, but as the film progressed I kept wondering if my disappointment was merely a product of my unfair expectations. That's probably the case. I expect a daring comedy from the Brothers Farrelly, but Shallow Hal is surprisingly low-key. It doesn't go for easy laughs, as it easily could have done. The plot concerns a looks-obsessed guy (Jack Black) who is hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty of others. He falls in love with a fat woman who appears to him as Gwyneth Paltrow. When the film came out, a lot of people complained that this was terrible; he only loves her because he is attracted to Gwyneth Paltrow, not the fat incarnation that appears in only a couple of shots in the first 90 minutes of the film. But these people didn't really stick around for the payoff in the third act. What's so surprising about this film is how emotionally involving it is. A lot of this is due to Gwyneth Paltrow, who actually gives one of her best performances. But fans of the Farrelly Brothers, as I am myself, will not be shocked to find that emotional center. It was there in both Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. It's just as fun when the Brothers are mean-spirited, however, as they were in Me, Myself, & Irene and, even better, the unfairly maligned Dumb and Dumber. The serious themes are really on full display here, though. The Brothers have a true and touching affection for physical outsiders. I still wish that they wouldn't have forsaken comedy so much, though. I suppose the only jokes would have been fat jokes, but maybe not. Jason Alexander provides almost all of the good laughs. We wonder why he and Jack Black are so mean about the looks of others when they aren't especially gorgeous themselves. Some people are still asking how such a man as Jason Alexander can be so shallow in this film, but they, as I've said before, didn't stick around until the end. This film may improve on repeat viewings, as it was bothering me for a long while. 7/10.

Instead of taking the downhill route of following their own imitators ('American Pie(s), Road Trip etc), they create this brilliant comedy that takes the genre to a new dimension. (Note They DID try to get into that gross out comedy race though, partially with 'Me, Myself and Irene' which failed in so many ways).This movie takes the well known fact that beauty is subjective and combines it with the saying that only inner beauty matters. To me anything more about the plot would be revealing too much; you should see the movie for yourself to fully enjoy it.Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent, so is Jack Black in his first leading role. The rest of the cast is the usual Farrelly cast that is always so marvelous. Also some of the most beautiful girls ever on film parade from time to time.One thing that has to be clarified This movie DOES NOT make fun of overweight people. The Farrellys are not hypocrites nor politically correct, but that doesn't mean that they are cruel. Fat people shouldn't be patronized by anyone. This would be the real insult. And that goes for every Farrelly movie.Finally I just wanted to say that 'Shallow Hal' came as a surprise to me. I never would expected the Farrelly brothers to have so much artistic power left to be able to rise above today's low standards in comedy with yet another gem, which in my opinion is the best movie of 2001.

Generally being turned off to stereotypical plots I was very hesitant to see this movie. Of course all of my friends totally loved this movie. They thought it was sweet and charming and bashed the critics for thinking that it was demeaning to any one type of social group because they felt that since Hal chose to be with Rosemary at the end of the film that that meant that the movie itself was teaching everyone some great beautiful lesson about how you can see the beauty within. Well being a plus size girl myself (Im a size 16-and cute to boot hehe)I made myself watch this movie, and all I can say is that, I beg to differ. To be fair I do think the Farrelly brothers were trying to send a positive message here. I don't think that their intent was to degrade anyone, but they ended up making the movie a hypocritical mess. Not only did they portray Ugly woman as fat with bad skin and big noses,they also portrayed Beautiful women as being mega-bitches with a whip. As if we women (and men) don't have enough to feel self conscious about. I mean think about it. Jack Black, while being a very funny guy and good actor, just isn't conventionally Hollywood attractive. But he loved Rosemary. Which is great, however they would never think about putting let's say, Brad Pitt in as playing Hal and have him running off with an obese woman in the end. So therefore Obese women can only get someone like Jack Black to love them??? The other stereotype that irritated the crap out of me was that, not only was Rosemary obese, but she was also a glutton. As if ALL big women eat 5 course meals every time we sit at the table. Anyways, just a big peeve there.The point is, that everyone knows that movies and Hollywood set this impossible standard on how women and men should look and everyone here admits it's wrong, yet people still feel they have to alter themselves to be something that they are not. I feel that this movie, while trying to mean well...exacerbates this concept and causes hurt feelings.A valiant effort of the F-Bros part, but it just didn't cut the mustard with me.

Ok so it's a bit thin on consistency and not strictly politically correct, but hey that's what having a sense of humour is all about. Consider the guy with spina bifida, do you think that the Farrelly brothers made up every joke in his script?, of course not, these are probably lines he uses every day to help him keep his disability in perspective and enjoy down-to-earth relationships with others (at least I hope he does, as that is what every mature, well adjusted and truly confident person must be able to do no matter what the scale of imperfection they have, and incidentally something that those with greater disabilities have generally learned to develop much quicker in life than the often seemingly perfect paragons of beauty in society who're always checking their face in the mirror to spot the first sign of a wrinkle or whether their butt looks big in their outfit) and if not, I can't imagine he would allow those jokes to be said of him in a movie that gets worldwide distribution and not in everyday life. And from those people I think we can learn an important lesson because whether we want to accept it or not, no matter how beautiful we are, at some stage our physical attributes will decay, and the longer we prolong acceptance of this fact the longer we delay the agony of the paralysing insecurity that only grows stronger as our bodies grow weaker and is an intrinsic result of placing greater importance on aesthetic qualities. And the movie demonstrated that beautifully through the juxtaposing of Walt's genuine contentment with Mauricio's ever growing obsession with his receding hairline.What's more it is quite clear that despite the fact by default we are all more influenced by the physical than we should be, (Hal being your satirically quintessential case), he quite realistically - despite the farcical nature of the film - learned through a shocking realisation (a beautiful moment in the film), his lesson. It wasn't a moment of whimsy it really did move him deeply and triggered a period of serious self analysis which as a result changed him. An experience we would all do well to have.So while it did have it's flaws appreciate that as a whole Shallow Hal conveyed an important moral that we could all use some reminding about, so please reviewers, think before you write all those self righteous reviews about how morally bankrupt it is.Now excuse me I have to go check my hair in the mirror.

In one particularly stupid segment, the fat girl is so heavy she breaks her seat at a restaurant.  Dumb, unkind and unlikely.  Thirty minutes later fat girl breaks another chair at a different restaurant. How is Hal supposed to get beyond the unattractive fat? The fat girl herself thinks she's unattractive.  Her father also says she's unattractive.  At least Hal is shallow.  What's Dad's excuse?Fat people also have no manners.  When offered a slice of cake, Rosemary breaks off one-third, grabs it in her bare hand, and walks off through her Dad's office.  Do the Farrelly's really think this is how obese people behave?  This may fly in Dumb and Dumber, but Paltrow's character is far from dumb, she is after all educated and affluent.To show us none of us is above being petty and judgmental, the Farrelly's use a character with crippled, withered legs which drag behind him as he walks, doubled over on his hands.  The device is particularily jarring.  This characters big joke comes when during a road trip fuel stop when Hal asks why he's donning rubber gloves.  Have you ever walked across a gas station restroom on with your bare hands, he replies.  Makes me long for the sophistication of American Pie.Shallow Hal has it's moments of brilliance, offering a look at the world from some radically different perspectives.  But those moments are too few.  Sitting through this movie left me with the same feeling I get when I hear a racist joke or see someone ridiculed.  Perhaps the working title was Hateful Hal.

But my perception of the filmmaking duo has been forever altered with the release of Shallow Hal, the sweetest and most endearing picture of the year.      Meet Hal Larson (Jack Black).  He's an average Joe with less-than-average looks, yet he believes himself to be God's gift to the female race.  Taking a step back, Hal's father, while dying, gave nine-year-old Hal the advice that all life is about is sleeping with gorgeous women.  So Hal, along with his best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander), prowls about the nightclub circuit in search of sexy ladies.      However, a freak accident leaves Hal trapped in an elevator for several hours with self-help guru Tony Robbins (playing himself).  Robbins proceeds to place a sort of spell on Hal so that he can only see the inner beauty of people.       Later, Hal meets the kindhearted Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), a Peace Corps worker currently volunteering at a local hospital.  Hal is enamored with her, for he sees a stunningly beautiful woman.  However, everyone else only sees Rosemary's obesity.       Soon, Hal finds himself head over heels in love with Rosemary.  But when the spell upon Hal is broken, he must decide whether or not he still loves Rosemary, despite appearances.       The Farrelly Brothers have finally struck gold with this gem of a film.  Granted, there are a few seemingly obligatory fat jokes scattered throughout, this being the Brothers' trademark.  However, what these two men have crafted is one of the most beautiful and touching films in a long time.  How many films nowadays actually have a message to teach?  Shallow Hal teaches an obvious and amazing message of not being concerned with external appearances; it's what's on the inside that counts.       The film has got an overwhelming sweetness and an underlying yet sublime sadness to it.  It makes everyone in the audience think twice about their own shallowness.         The two leading performances are outstanding.  The ever-brilliant Gwyneth Paltrow delivers one of the year's best performances as the 300-pound Rosemary.  She brings a quality to her character that is exuberant yet wistful.  Paltrow's emotional range is superb, and the character becomes not someone we feel sorry for, but someone we applaud.  Jack Black is wonderful as the title character.  Funny, believable, and ultimately moving, Black's performance is top-notch.       Shallow Hal is a small film with a big message, and the Farrelly Brothers orchestrate it to perfection.  After leaving the theater, it took me a while to get my emotions under control.  This film is a heartwarming experience that should be shared by all and missed by none. Backed up by the terrific performances, Shallow Hal turns out to be one of 2001's best films.

Its the one film where they (for the most part) restrain their penchant for sick jokes and crass humour, and actually concentrate on characterisation for a change.Shallow Hal is basically a one joke scenario. It takes a very simple conceit of a superficial man hypnotised to see the inner beauty of others. Where fat people look slim and gorgeous. Burn victims look fine. And psoriasis sufferers don't have to worry about flakes.If Shallow Hal were content to milk the fat jokes for all they were worth, it would have quickly run out of steam very early on. A pitfall most one joke movies fall into. So its to the Farrelly's credit they took a different approach and transformed it into a sweet and appealing fable about appearances and matched it with the right actors so it becomes a comedy of surprising depth.Jack Black is Shallow Hal. And in his first leading role, he does quite well. Showing he's got what it takes to carry a film on his shoulders. Bringing confidence, his usual zest, and likability to the part of a selfish cynic. Hal was taught by his father on his deathbed to only go for the most desirable woman. In other words, beautiful and sexy are the ones to shoot for. Ugly and unattractive is a no fly zone.But where the film really shines is Gwyneth Paltrow as Rosemary, the 200 pound woman who suddenly appears slim and nubile to Hal. Paltrow is one of my all time favourite actresses, and she gives Shallow Hal its life and vitality.A sweetly appealing performance, Rosemary has learnt to accept her weight, but when Hal shows an interest in her, she at first thinks its out of pity, especially when he keeps passing her compliments about how beautiful she is.Of course Hal really believes her to be a beautiful woman. So his interest in her is genuine. Something that does wonders for Rosemary's self-esteem. Gwyneth Paltrow was a real good sport with some of the things she was asked to do. Donning a fat suit and tons of makeup, her performance is worthy of special mention because her sweet optimism continues to shine through.Not to mention she is the butt of several fat jokes, such as giant sized thongs, benches collapsing under her weight, and clearing a pool of water when she dive bombs. But the fact that she convinces us of her weight is what makes Rosemary more than just a caricature.The real theme of the film is Hal's journey of self-discovery. Its quite a balancing act, but the film is remarkably successful in keeping Hal's growth plausible. It all reaches a turning point as Hal is de-hypnotised and sees Rosemary for what she really is. When Hal tries to avoid her, there are times when I felt like thumping him.The resolution is never in any doubt. Hal will come to his senses and come to love Rosemary for who she is. And not have to live up to his expectations. The final image of Rosemary carrying Hal in her arms is amusing, even if things do get a bit predictable towards the end.Still, Shallow Hal is my favourite Farrelly film. Its not just a film about fragile overweight people. Its aspirations are broader and a little more nobler than the average Farrelly film. And worth seeing for the sight of a man with a tail. That's worth the price of admission alone!

There was a great moral truth to this picture, that a person should look deeper into a person and not always feel that their Soul Mate in life has to be slim and trim or look like a fashion model.

On the other hand, it's going to come as a pleasant surprise to others.  The former group will be those who came to this movie hoping to find a title character to whom they can relate, thus enabling them to go on to bask in the gratification of cheap shot humor and infantile, adolescent perspectives that no doubt served them well throughout high school, and which, unfortunately, like a caterpillar unable to evolve because of some impediment of nature, they have been incapable of shedding as adults.  The latter, probably after some initial resistance-- inasmuch as the Farrelly Brothers seem to be tackling a rather sensitive subject this time out (and `sensitivity' is not necessarily their milieu)-- will for whatever reason find their way to this film, only to discover that the Farrelly Brothers actually have something worthwhile to say, and moreover, that they say it extremely well.  `Shallow Hal,' written by Sean Moynihan, Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly, and directed by the Farrellys, uses the parlance of our times, as it were, to examine the old axiom that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep.  It's a universal message, it's important, and it's delivered by the Farrellys with humor and poignancy, and in a way that is altogether effective.In no small part due to some deathbed `pearls of wisdom' offered to young Hal (Sasha Neulinger) by his father, the Reverend Larson (Bruce McGill), Hal carries with him into adulthood a rather, well...'shallow' sense of what constitutes perfection, especially when it comes to the opposite, fairer sex.  And, with a good friend, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), constantly reinforcing (with his own shallow perspectives) those put forth by the late Reverend Larson, it has not placed Hal (Jack Black) in good stead with the women he encounters.  Relationships elude him like the proverbial sands through the hourglass, and he can't figure out why. Then one auspicious day, on the heels of yet another rejection, Hal gets stuck in an elevator with none other than writer and motivational speaker Tony Robbins, the `Mahatma of Motivation.'  And, after hearing the sad story of Hal's misfortunes with women, Robbins uses his powers and wisdom to do something about it.  He gives Hal a gift  The ability to see the true beauty that resides within another person, beyond the often deceptive physical attributes that are in reality no more than a facade masking who that person really is.  For the first time in his life, Hal's eyes are opened, and it isn't long before he meets the most beautiful woman in the world, Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), with whom he quickly falls desperately, deeply and passionately in love.  At last, he's happy; it's like a fairy tale.  The question is, can this particular fairy tale possibly have a happy ending?The Farrelly Brothers, known for their cutting edge, over-the-top visually graphic gross-out humor in such films as `There's Something About Mary' and `Me, Myself and Irene,' have reined it in drastically in this one, and to great effect.  To be sure, that trademark Farrelly `touch' is present (there is some bathroom/locker room humor), but in this case, it serves a purpose beyond shock value entertainment.  If you've seen the trailers for this film, or any clips from it, you get the idea that this is typical Farrelly Brothers fare and that there is no way that the characters involved are going to possibly emerge unscathed from it.  But what you see in those previews is basically the elements the Farrellys use to define their parameters and set up the message they want to deliver.  And it works beautifully.  They succeed in establishing Hal's misguided perspectives, as well as those of Mauricio, and from that base springs the emotional connection, empathy and compassion generated by the rest of the film as the story unfolds.  What we find, is that Hal isn't such a bad guy after all, once his eyes are opened; that a new perspective and changed attitude has served to reveal that better part of himself, as well as others.  And that, perhaps, says something about all of us.  Upon reflection, if it is possible to perceive the real beauty of another, maybe it works both ways.  As this film so succinctly points out, we, as a society, have been so programmed by peer pressure, the media and all of these inconsequential external forces, to equate `beauty' with all of the wrong things, that we all suffer for it, in one way or another.  And the message here is so clear  What a wonderful world it would be, if only we could all see past the meaningless things and just see one another for who and what we really are.  Like a sage old man on a mountain, the Farrellys have crafted and delivered a layer cake, chocolate sundae of a movie; there's plenty of whipped cream on the top, but once you work your way to the center it's even better.  It's their way of using contemporary trappings to point the way to the divine mercies and offering a taste of the rewards that go to those who are wise enough to discern their meaning, and to act upon it.  Unfortunately, the `Shallow Hals' in the audience are going to get lost along the way, and it will be their loss.  And that certainly is not a criticism; it's just the way it is.As Rosemary, Gwyneth Paltrow will absolutely win your heart.  It's a performance that evokes empathy and compassion to the point that you desperately do NOT want to see this girl hurt in any way.  And Jack Black gives a performance that, quite frankly, is going to surprise a lot of people; there is more to him than meets the eye.  In fact, that about sums up `Shallow Hal'--  a surprisingly insightful and inspirational film.  9/10.

He runs into a self-help guru who decides to teach him a lesson, and bends his mind so that he can not notice how fat and disgusting women are he sees them as skinny young hotties.Problem with this Farrelly Brothers pic is that Hal is not learning any lesson he's not actually looking beyond their looks, he just sees them as good looking. So as far as Hal is concerned, he's still being shallow.In order to be funny, Farrellys had to represent his learning not to be shallow as just a visual impairment where he hallucinates fat people as skinny. Its the only way the comedy would have worked, yes, but its fairly offensive.The movie is still saying that these people are disgusting, and that only someone who has been brainwashed would want to be with them. Its ending is implausible, and has no impact on this message.2/10. Anyone who doesn't look as cute as Gwynyth Paltrow does in real life don't see this film. You will find it offensive.

How would you perceive the people around you if all you could see was their inner beauty? How clearly would it demonstrate we mostly judge people based on their looks, clothing, make-up and style. Unfortunately Hollywood has managed to use this premise and ruin it in Shallow Hal. It may seem to be a filmed version of exactly that experiment, yet is isn't once you think about it. It's not our shallow lead character only sees Rosemary's inner beauty, he is mind-tricked into seeing inner beauty translated into a hot and sexy package. So after all he is not wooing Gwynneth Paltrow because of her great personality, he is still chasing his usual hare, today's ideal in looks, who also happens to be a nice person. Duhh! THINK! In fact, this movie boils down to shallow jokes about fat people, like huge knickers and such, where the source of many of the corny jokes lies in the fact the audience know how fat his dream girl really is, a fact which he is oblivious to. And of course, in the end, when he 'wakes up' he cannot but conclude Rosemary is still who he wants to be with. So, lucky nice and fat people, there is hope after all. All you have to hope for is a blind or hypnotised goof ball who cannot see you are fat, and then, maybe you'll get lucky if this period lasts long enough. Be honest, would you have liked Rosemary (kind of a boring goodie two shoes gal if you ask me) if you had to constantly watch let's say Roseanne Arnold (Barr) play that exact same character? It amazes me how many people apparently don't see the hypocrisy in this flick and don't even feel their intelligence is abused here. Besides this stupidity the film just isn't funny, it hardly made me laugh. In a nutshell trash it. Waste of your time and intelligence. 2/10 "},{"Title":"A big heart makes up for the hit-or-miss comedy","Date":"18 April 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Shallow Hal is a mix of a very sweet and earnest love story with a comedy that often doesn't really work. I was won over by the fantasy love element and I do think it has more appeal than it doesn't. The idea that the titular character Hal (Jack Black) is a shallow guy who gets hypnotized into seeing women as they are inside instead of what they look like on the outside. He begins falling in love with Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), a fat woman that has a big heart.Alright, that premise doesn't really make any sense because how could Hal know what people are like on the inside unless he knew them intimately, and unless the hypnosis also messed around with his sense of touch and his strength, there's no way he wouldn't realize that his vision is all kinds of screwed up, but let's just get past that. I feel like there's some good potential for humor with this premise, like if say a hot shot celebrity had an ugly sister and Hal confused one for the other, or he was a makeup artist (or even funnier, a plastic surgeon) and he started going crazy with people's faces even though they didn't need it. I'm sure you can come up with some good ideas too. Not a lot of the potential is used here. What we do get plenty of is exactly what you would expect from the premise. Hit or miss jokes about Hal thinking that some ladies are hot while everyone around him stands dumbfounded, fat jokes, and visual gags of seeing beautiful women looking at big clothes or plates full of food and they don't even have the courtesy of coming in quickly enough to build off of each other and make you laugh.What saves the movie, and I would say actually makes it legitimately good is the love plot. As a fine male specimen with impeccable features that regularly has to fight the ladies off with a stick, you might not think that a story about an insecure lady who has been ignore her whole life one day discovering a man that falls head over heels for her would necessarily phase me, but it really did. If you've ever felt like you were judged because of what you looked like on the outside, that part of the movie will really drive home and it will make you smile. This comedy could have dropped the ball badly by handling the hypnotism thing the wrong way, making it feel like Hal is simply tricked into loving her, but without giving away what exactly happens during the conclusion, I felt like it handled that potential problem very well. This could have easily become a tasteless, mean-spirited mess, one that gets its laughs at the expense of unattractive people and I'm glad to say that it doesn't. The conclusion really pulls it all together and makes the shaky premise work. Overall Shallow Hal isn't of the Farrelly Brothers' funniest film but it probably is their most heartwarming.

It has a much deeper message than it appears. It knows when to be funny and knows when to be serious. Why so many people disliked it and why critics panned it is totally beyond me!The movie is about a man named Hal, played by Jack Black, who judges women based on their looks. He keeps failing at it and his attractive neighbor, Jill, even turns him down after he begs her to go out with him. The next day at his job, he's bummed that he didn't get that big promotion and happens to bump into Tony Robbins in the elevator while leaving his work. They get stuck in the elevator and Hal explains him his love life. Robbins then puts a spell on him to see the inner beauty in women so that he can judge a woman based on her personality. Suddenly, things starts to change for Hal. His best friend Mauricio (played by Jason Alexander) notices Hal's fresh new standards with his taste in women and doesn't like it one bit. Hal then begins dating a woman who is overweight named Rosemary, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. He sees her as a beautiful, petite woman and they hit it off. Mauricio, who is much more picky with women and more shallow than Hal, can't believe it.That's the plot for you and I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that the story is predictable and the characters are memorable. I can't give the cast enough credit for doing such a wonderful job and it's interesting to see Jack Black like you've never seen him before, departing from his usual slacker/stoner role that he's given. Shallow Hal is a movie with a lot of brains and heart to it, as well as a great date movie. There's more to this movie than it appears, so watch it before you say negative things about it and you may be surprised! "},{"Title":"The Farrelly Brothers made a sweet-natured romance?  WTF?","Date":"26 February 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" When it comes to movies, the Farrelly brothers have a reputation for outrageous, raunchy, low brow comedy that appeals the the lowest common denominator in all of us. So it comes as a surprise that the Farrellys made a gentle romance...and it actually works.Oh, there's some of their trademark humor in the film. But it's more toned down, and while the film is undeniably light-hearted, the focus for the main part of the film is the romance between two people.Hal (Jack Black) is an immensely shallow bachelor. His standards for what qualifies as datable material are so high that they must be heard to be believed. Unfortunately for Hal, he's no Brad Pitt. After a chance meeting with self-help guru Tony Robbins (as himself), Hal's views of women are turned inside out. Now, how they are on the inside is projected (to him, at least) on the outside. What I mean is that good people look like bombshells to Hal, and the jerks look like hell. Then he meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow); to him, she's a goddess, but to others, like his equally shallow pal, Mauricio, she's a two-ton blob!Shallow Hal is about perception, and the difference between that and reality. People's visual appearance is only half of what makes a person who they are (if that), and that's something that Hal learns over the course of the movie.The two leads are great. Jack Black is surprisingly effective in a semi-dramatic role. We totally believe him as he tries to swoon Rosemary, who not being the blond bombshell that he thinks she is, believes he is making fun of her. As his opposite, Gwyneth Paltrow is simply radiant. She's a good person with a good soul, and while in other hands Rosemary may have turned out to be a caricature of Mother Theresa, Paltrow keeps Rosemary believable. Black and Paltrow have excellent chemistry together, and in a film that focuses more on the romance than the comedy, this is especially important.Supporting players like Jason Alexander, the late great Joe Vitrelli, Susan Ward, and of course, Tony Robbins, are great as well. Jason Alexander is great as the best friend whose shallowness is a response to his insecurities. Surprisingly, Tony Robbins is very effective, and not uncomfortable in a performance, but then again, this is kind of what he does for a living.The Farrellys have a reputation for being politically incorrect, and proud of it. And while there's some of that here, the people who make the jokes are shown to be stupid and shallow, or in the case of Rene Kirby (a womanizer who walks on all fours because of his spinal bifida), making fun of themselves. This avoids the trap of making the film exploitative or offensive.There's nothing especially noteworthy about this film, but it does do what it tries, and overall, it's a fun movie.

And, because of the drugs that his father is given, Dad's not the same man as he usually is. Lying in the hospital bed, giving his nine year old son, his last words of wisdom, he tells him never to settle for average, and that he should only be with beautiful, fit women for the rest of his life. With these thoughts running through his head, Hal become quite shallow in his adult life. He and his friend, Mouricio (Alexander), circle the clubs almost every night trying to find the hottest ladies. Until one day, Hal ends up in an elevator with Tony Robbins, the elevator stalls and they're stuck together inside of it, for hours and hours. During which time, Hal confesses his tendencies for gorgeous unattainable women. Robbins, almost hypnotises or puts a spell on him, so that from that point on he will only see the inner beauty of women. After this, Hal finds it much easier to meet beautiful women, and meets the girl of his dreams, Rosemary (Paltrow). Although Hal is in love with her, and doesn't see anything wrong with her, everyone around him does. The movie isn't so much hilarious as it is just light and funny. There are a few lines that may make you crack up, while others will just leave you shaking your head, because their pretty stupid. However, for the most part, it's a great comedy and a keeper.

The typical case, but one day he falls in love with a 300 pounds woman, because he doesn't see her real personality. He sees her as a beautiful, smart and kinda pessimistic woman.The point of the movie is that people should look less and less for nice looking people with high self confidence, very specific taste and caprices. That happens all time everywhere around the world. It might have been said before, but I don't know how many people agree with it. Outer appearance sometimes doesn't matter although I am not 100% in agreement with this thing. It's important, cause in our early years, we have been looking at beautiful and sexy women and it's just something you could never let behind your back, but once you have such an experience as Hal does, you might change your notion about what is real love, what is a good woman or man and what is something you simply wanna be with for more than one hot night.Of course the movie introduces some strange moments involving characters and Jack Black is overacting in some scenes, but it isn't that much of a problem.

The Farrelly Brothers made a beautiful film with SHALLOW HAL.  True....it's no 'classic', but for those brothers it is very insightful.  I went into the movie expecting to watch it rolling my eyes every few minutes at the crude remarks and tasteless stereotypes of society's 'uglies.'  Instead I found that the movie provided an interesting look at self-esteem and what it's like for so many girls and guys in this country where outer beauty and perfection is held to be so important.I found the acting in the story to be very realistic.  Gwyneth Paltrow truly captured the whole character Rosemary--her insecurities at being so big and her inner beauty which helped her to give so much of herself to aid those in need around her.  I also think Jack Black was amazing as Hal.  I never thought I'd crush on him, but he was really sweet and presented such a good soul that it's hard not to like him.  Jason Alexander was good as his nuerotic self-absorbed friend, who actually ***SPOILER**** is not as shallow as he seems.  He too suffers from the insecurities placed on him by a society which values perfection. ***END OF SPOILER***The movie has some loose ends and some characters who don't totally fit into the plot.  Also...as a bigger girl I can say that some of Rosemary's outfits are totally unrealistic, but hey...more power to her!! D  The movie also disregards the idea that appearance isn't really important for attraction.  To truly believe that is actually as shallow as thinking beauty is the most important thing.But in the end the movie promotes strong self-esteem.  Liking oneself and knowing that one is good enough no matter what, is a theme that comes across.  The film also reminds us that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder....enough so that we are reminded to at least take the time to get to know people before we judge them based solely on their looks.I give the movie a 4 out of 5....for totally surprising me and for being such a sweet movie.

They used Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit, which further makes me believe that they think fat women can't be beautiful or they would have used someone who was really big in order to make their point. Now, I thought that the way they showed what torment a lot of us big women go through everyday with the stares, comments....etc. was good, but they also countered that good act with making her eat like a pig and having her chair collapse, which also is a slap in the face to many big people, because not all of us eat too much (I'm a vegan, as well), some of us are big because of medical problems (like myself) and not all of us have had a chair collapse; I haven't.

The main story is about Hal, (Jack Black) who will only date extremely attractive women, who are usually way out of his league. Early in the film, Hal has a life changing experience with Tony Robins, the self help guru who changes the way he views women by letting him see their inner beauty. To some people this might sound like a chick flick, but it is much more than just another movie your girlfriend is going to want you to watch with her. But if she does, you should probably thank her.Jack Black is by far one of the funniest people I have ever seen on film. Everything about him just seems to make me want to laugh. The way he speaks, moves, and his facial expressions alone make me go into a fit of laughter that usually ends with me wiping tears away. One of the biggest things that appealed to me is that Jack Black, unlike some actors, comes across like a regular person. This makes his acting appear a little more natural than other actors. I can go on and on about Jack Black, but enough about him, let me say something about a few of the other actors in the film and the roles they play. Maurieco(Jason Alexander), whom you probably know from his role on Sienfeld as George Castanza, is Hal's best friend. Maurieco suffers from the same affliction as Hal--shallowness. Personally, I have never cared for Seinfeld or the role Jason Alexander played on it, but to my surprise he was absolutely hilarious in the movie. His spray on hair, attitude,and tail, that is right I said tail, all make for a good chuckle here and there. Then there is Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), the girl Hal falls for after the elevator encounter with Tony Robins. Now keep in mind that Rosemary is not the drop dead gorgeous creature that Hal sees, but is really an extremely obese woman. Paltrow comes across well as being this shy kindhearted girl whom men would usually not want to date because of her weight problem. Even though she and Jack Black is sort of an odd couple on screen, somehow the two of them make it work, and it seems believable. All the actors in the film do a wonderful job and meld well together, making for some extremely funny scenes. However,the majority of the laughs in the film are visual. The costume designers and special effects team are responsible for some of the funniest bits in the film. For example, when Rosemary seen as normal Gwyneth Paltrow and not the obese Rosemary, jumps in the pool, the splash that ensues is like a tidal wave, lifting a boy out of the water and casting him into a tree. Or when Rosemary sat in a booth at a restaurant and it collapsed at just the right moment while she and Hal are talking. This made me laugh so hard I almost wet myself. The way the makeup artist and costume designers made all these beautiful women appear horrifyingly ugly is worth mention as well. The Farelly brothers, directors of the film, have another hilarious hit on their hands with Shallow Hal. So what are you waiting for, go get a copy of Shallow Hal today. One of the funniest films I have ever seen. A non stop riot from beginning to end, that might even make you think about the way you view people. Watch it with your friends, or relax with a loved one and enjoy this wacky romantic comedy.

After meeting Tony Robbins, a talented hypnotherapist in an elevator, Tony gives Hal a gift to see inner beauty instead of what's on the outside. After receiving this gift, Hal begins to see inner beauty and starts a relationship with Rosemary Shannahan, an overweight, 300-pound Peace Corp volunteer. Hal's friend, Mauricio refers to Rosemary when he first sees her as a rhino which indicates that he also bases his womanising on appearance. When Mauricio dumps his girlfriend because her second toe is longer than her first toe it clearly represented that he dumps girls because he's scared of something as Hal points out. Towards the end of the movie, Mauricio ends up confessing to Hal that he has a spinal condition which therefore indicates that he makes up excuses to avoid women. In today's society, people in general tend to focus too much on the outside appearance. When a friendship develops between a male and female, the personality shines and possesses the potential to develop into an intimate relationship. But if we refuse to not give people a chance of all races and appearance then we are not giving ourselves the chance to find that one special person. Today in this superficial world, the generic definition of beautiful is skinny and blonde. Although what ever other people think is beautiful people still continue to possess strong standards. I agree that you have to be attracted, but can't you be attracted by personality? The outside appearance of a person should not matter and this exact message lies underneath the meaning of Shallow Hal.

The issue I have with the movie is that, in the course of making the point that we should see the inner-beauty in fat people, the Farrellys are implying that by being overweight you are universally ugly. In fact, in the world of Shallow Hal, if you are fat, you are a well-meaning mammoth who couldn't possibly be fancied unless under hypnosis or after an epiphany.The movie also seems to suggest that the friends of fat people are ugly, and that uglies keep each other's company because no one else will want to associate with them, which is another reinforcement of social divisions. All of Rosemary's (Paltrow) friends are, as we see at the end, equally fat or gross or otherwise physically undesirable. Most disturbingly, the Farrellys undermine the inner-beauty point they've spent $40 million trying to make through Hal, because Hal's friends betray the judgmental reality. When his buddies see Rosemary for what she is, i.e. grossly fat, they are universally horrified in a what are you doing with her? way, which carries a more powerful punch than any of the tepid attempts to suggest she's beautiful because of her personality (moulded, we are told, by years of personal abuse because of her size). The overall message is correct - inner beauty is ultimately what counts, because a sparkling character will outlast youthful good looks by decades. But the Farrelly's have approached the subject in a way that actually insults, rather than genuinely educates. It's not going to uplift anyone who's overweight, it'll just depress them. The majority of the film perpetuates the idea that being fat or ugly makes you a pariah or the object of sympathy or vulgar fascination.  There are some sweet moments, and a few laughs, so the movie's not a wholly worthless experience. But in the process of making its (valid) point it reinforces, rather than rejects, stereotypes.

That is, it shows an overweight, kind, humorous wonderful woman as the thin, model-like Gwyneth Paltrow and a model-like, thin, bitchy gold-digging woman as old and wrinkly, thereby making the same connection between young, slim model-like good looks and a good personality that it is trying to criticize.But then I realized that the movie doesn't make this connection, the character Hal makes it. He is hypnotized or something like that to see peoples good personalities, their inner beauty, regardless of what they actually look like, and he visualizes this inner beauty as the young slim model-like good looks of Gwyneth Paltrow because he is, in fact, shallow.Personally I'm attracted to other kinds of women than slim models, so if I was hypnotized the same way I wouldn't have seen Paltrow. At least I hope I wouldn't.So what I'm saying is that this movie isn't as shallow as many people say it is.

Unlike most of the people writing here, I had no preconceived ideas about what the authors of the work were going to do as I had not even heard of them (Farrelly). So, discovering this film was like discovering Farrelly.Like it or not, for some strange reason which I will never understand, Western Europeans and Americans have been been brainwashed thru media and the like to think that Fat is bad and that Thin is Good. In absolute terms, there is no logic or basis to this, beauty and attraction being NOTHING to do with body size, but the fact is that whilst the idle rich of Europe and the USA ( mostly women who have nothing better to spend their money on) spend thousands of dollars, pounds or euros having their flab cut off, their breasts increased or their faces lifted, people in poorer countries are desperately looking for the wherewithal to buy something to eat. Thus is the logic of the human race and it all goes to show that beauty is a TOTALLY subjective perception which has absolutely NOTHING to do with body size but is a pure product of media influence and nothing else. You can be sure that cavemen and cave-girls surely had completely different criteria for beauty and/or sexual attraction from those dictated by current-day western society.The interesting thing about this film is that it changes this perception in the life of one man, Jack Black, who sees as beautiful ladies whom everybody else in society, following media diktats, see as ugly or unattractive. This is the best part of the film and Jack Black acts this part to perfection, genuinely amazed that others cannot perceive the beauty in these ladies that he himself does.Unfortunately this state of grace comes to a rapid end when his stupid friend ( who deserved more than a punch in the face !! ) decides to selfishly meddle in matters and go and see the guru who converted Jack Black to this state of mind.The rest of the film does show the beauty of the heart as winning the final battle but not without some unpleasant moments beforehand.Cynics will argue that to make the point, the film makers used Gwyneth Paltrow incarnating all the stereotypes of the supposedly perfect woman ( i.e. tall, thin and blond ). This is indeed true and includes manipulation in itself, but for the needs of the film ( assuming the film is to be shown in W Europe and USA ) we may admit it was probably the strongest way of getting the idea across.I personally have never paid attention to the physical beauty of someone on first sight and have found that the more you know a person, the more you talk with them, their physical beauty actually changes either for the worse or for the better, depending on the character they reveal to you and the compatibility of that character in relation to your own and what you are expecting. This obviously means that the perception of beauty actually takes precedence over the physical traits themselves - and this perception is modified as and when the other person opens their heart to you ! I had never actually seen a film dealing with this subject and was delighted that someone had actually taken the time to study it and make this film - which to me comes over as highly intelligent and well thought out. I had never been expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy and would not have enjoyed it if it had been thus.I am sure that with time the film will gain in importance and will no doubt be treated as a curiosity in about 100 years time when the wheel will have turned and fat people will be considered the norm and the thin or slender people as ugly sods ! The film does contain some humorous moments but these are minor compared to the general thread which is one of tenderness and kindness. Any person who feels that he or she is outside the politically correct physical standards dictated to western society by the media and by fashion shows etc. and therefore out on a limb so to speak should take the time to watch this film. It does show that true beauty is really in the eye and the heart of the beholder and NOWHERE else !

The actress is truly beautiful for no actress can draw on emotions and attitudes of which she has no awareness; the actress gave us Rosie Small AND Rosie Large and, ironically, offered the audience true beauty in both.

I'm not kidding! Shallow Hal ALMOST had some real philosophical subject matter... almost. This is the good news the bad news is that Peter and Bobby Farrelly still resort to some raunchy (but not AS disgusting) humor that proves to us they're still a long way from maturity. Even so, who cares? Shallow Hal is an original comedy that came out during a time period in which the entire concept of originality didn't exist. When I saw the trailers for the movie, I -- like most of you, probably -- thought, Oh my gosh; when are they going to stop making these stupid movies! But now, after actually watching the film, I stand corrected. The synopsis of Shallow Hal is this ~*~ POSSIBLE SPOILERS ~*~ a guy named Hal (Jack Black) is brainwashed by his father's dying words and thinks he'll only be happy if he marries a beautiful woman with huge... well, you get the point. Anyway, in his search for the perfect spouse, he can hardly even find a date! So, when stuck in an elevator with a motivational guru, he's hypnotized so that he can only see the inner beauty of women. Make a long story short, Hal starts going out with a three-hundred-pound blimp (Gwyneth Paltrow) who, in his eyes, is a beautiful -- and skinny -- sweetheart. This is when we approach philosophical themes Hal is in love with Rosemary (Paltrow), but is it just because he thinks she's a young and sexy hottie? Will their relationship last if and when he discovers who she really is? Watching this issue unfold on the screen was a pleasant surprise, and watching Shallow Hal was a fun -- and funny -- experience. If you're looking for a nice feel-good comedy, go to your video store and rent Shallow Hal. I think you -- like myself -- will be pleasantly surprised.Overall rating 8/10 "},{"Title":"I'm truly amazed...","Date":"29 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  May contain mild spoilersThere's nothing much amazing about Shallow Hal's core story1. Hal seeks perfect woman but has unrealistic expectations (yeah, that Britney Spears chick has great knockers but she's a tad muscular) and superficial perceptions  2. He is placed under a spell so he only sees people's inner beauty (or lack thereof)  3. Hal finds perfect woman Rosie (so he thinks) though in reality she is 300 lb  4. Spell is removed and Hal sees Rose as she really is  5. Hal hedges briefly then makes a life-changing decision to accept Rosie, even at the risk of forsaking his promising business career  6. They go off (to live happily ever after)I should correct myself. Hal's about face - from a dedicated hedonist, to someone prepared to turn his back on that and accept people on their real inner worth, is somewhat amazing. Could it ever happen? Maybe...What does amaze me though is that the film blatently promotes the cause of the disadvantaged and the unbeautiful people in our society, with the aid of a major Hollywood studio. Perhaps for this reason when I first watched the film I found it a bit hard to take (maybe I am a bit shallow?) However on watching it a second time I found it quite moving. Not sickly sentimental tho. The film makes its potentially unpopular point in quite a straightforward and direct way - it's also quite funny and slickly done.Gweneth Paltrow is great as Rosie. Even though when Hal sees her as slim and beautiful and she has nothing to be timid of re her looks (oh yeah, she has a great butt!), her facial expressions express perfectly the feelings that a 300 lb girl might have when faced with her first sexual experience or when Hal keeps calling her beautiful. I suspect she might be somewhat of a rarity in tinsel town she speaks of marriage as a grave thing and of being saddened when researching the film in her latex fat suit, by how people rejected her because of that apparent fatness.In summary Shallow Hal may offend some because of its message. Others will find it simply unbelievable. Maybe they're just being shallow.

The approach is novel if not a bit contrived, but it works in this genre.  The normally coarse Farrelly humor has been toned down considerably and the film is full of quiet chuckles with only a few guffaws sprinkled in.  Noticeably absent (thank heavens) is the profanity and body fluid humor.The Farrelly brothers (Directors/Producers Bobby and Peter) have made names for themselves by producing juvenile gross out flicks (Dumb and Dumber, Me, Myself and Irene, Say It Isn't So) targeted at teenage audiences.  Most of these were as successful as they were low brow.  Of course they also had a smash hit with `There's Something About Mary' which offered both their irreverent humor and a captivating story.  Also lurking on their resume is the little known, `Outside Providence' which is a sensitive romance that one would never associate with this tandem.  Given this background, `Shallow Hal' is something of an evolutionary film for the Farrellys.  They took a chance making a `grownup' film, though they paid for it at the box office.  For this I must give them a great deal of credit.This is a much more subtle and refined Farrelly vehicle that synthesizes many of the best elements of prior films, making it their best effort to date.  Hal's transformation from an immature and superficial jerk, to a caring and substantial person might be analogous to this film as a turning point on the Farrelly's resume.  One can only hope that this experiment is the beginning of a maturing process for two very talented directors, rather than validating to them that you can't make as much money making good films as you can trash.The acting is excellent.  Jack Black is a pleasant surprise as the main character.  He has the range to play both sides of the character effectively, alternately giving us great superficiality and great depth.  He is also extremely funny with a great variety of facial expressions and physical comedy that make him that much more endearing.  Gwyneth Paltrow just seems to get more beautiful with each film.  Her acting here is once again top rate, giving us a touching performance with equal parts of insecurity and sensitivity that one would expect from the character.  Her chemistry with Black is also terrific.  Jason Alexander adds his odd humor to the mix and gives the film some of its funnier moments.I have been critical of the Peter and Bobby Farrelly in the past, but to this film I say, `Bravo'.  I rated it a 8/10.  With any luck this will represents a direction and not a temporary detour from the puerile comedy that made them famous.

I have not become shallow - I have given in.To be fat in this ugly, mostly shallow world is not a pleasant experience.  This movie not only throws that in your face, you are asked to wallow in it.  I think it's a good thing to see this movie.  Perhaps most of the negative reviews have come from shallow, thin people who never had a problem wearing a bathing suit or undressing in a locker room...I am not sure, but it's a distinct possibility.I am waxing philosophical because I cried at the end of the movie.  Yet during the movie, I did laugh.  Perhaps I cried because it struck such a thunderous chord in my heart, perhaps because I enjoyed the way it ended.  I laughed at the some of the funny lines and situations I heard...only because I knew them too well in my heart.  I had been there before.Yes, the movie does reveal to us just how empty we can be.

It is very much like the completion of a musical phrase that the child's name suggests.  Hal's reaction reaches into your heart and tugs it.  And you know that Hal has grown. ***END***I enjoyed all of the performances, except with minor reservations- the one by Jason Alexander.  I do believe his characterization might have been drawn too broadly - but he was the need foil in the plot and he played the part as required.  All in all, the Farrelly's have done it again.The musical score was well wrought and the choice of two great old songs really added to the enjoyment of the movie  The Foundations' Baby, Now That I've Found You and Edison Lighthouse's Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Knows) I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt not quite right about their appearance and been ignored, insulted, and hurt by others' reactions.It's what's inside that counts....

And to be completely honest, I am glad that I went to see this film.  In reality, this movie states quite the opposite, than what I originally had thought  It praises the idea that appearances are nothing and what really matters is what is inside.As hard as we may all want to believe otherwise, appearances matter and play an incredibly active role in our everyday lives.  The ending of this film defies this deeply embedded part of human nature to create a very unique love story that will make you think.I should warn you that this film is directed by the Farrelly Brothers, so you can expect many exaggerated moments in this film.  In my opinion, this whole film is a powerful hyperbole designed not only entertain the audience but to teach them an important life lesson.  However, this film is not as funny as you might expect a Farrelly Brothers film to be.  I suppose it is because it deals with a sensitive issue, and there are many moments in the film where the audience simply didn't know whether to laugh to be upset. It might leave you feeling uneasy.Oh, I just want to add that I absolutely LOVED Gwyneth Paltrow in this movie so much that I had to include a bit about her.  She really does an amazing job as an actress.  Even though you know that she isn't really 300 lbs, she physically acts it so well that you can't help but to believe that she is. You really should watch this movie just to see her perform.My vote 7.7/10 (yeah, I know it is high.

Surely the fact that ultimately Jack sees Rosemary for who she truly is, and loves her, regardless of her weight, is what's important.  Jack is depicted as the idiot for being so superficial.  Isn't judging people for who they really are, not what they look like,  one of the goals of all those groups fighting for fat acceptance?  If not, it should be.

Definitely. POSITIVELY. I think this movie will even make you a little disturbed.  You'll realize that the Farrelys' were ever so slyly pointing a finger at you, and giggling.  You see, the 'fat' issue consumes both men AND women.  What struck me was not only were J.Black's and J.

We are always looking for a mate of these qualities because society has brainwashed us into thinking this is beauty. It is physical beauty, but when we must make a decision on whether we want to spend our life with a certain someone, we base this decision on inner beauty, the decency and profound kindness of soul, not some makeup job. This movie is also very emotional, because I sympathize easily with the characters. When Black reunites with the little girl Cadence towards the end, I truly did cry.

Hal's (Jack Black) Dad tells him that he should always aim for the highest in life, and never settle for less. This makes Hal, as it says in the title, very shallow.

So from that point on he sees people that has a good personality but not too attractive people extremely sexy...he even sees nerdy guys like a pretty boy if they have a good personality which is kind of weird because Hal's friend Mauricio looked the same the whole time and he was complaining about his girlfriend's toe was unperfect and she still looked hot and he was being picky, shouldn't he had been really ugly like the nurse? I guess they couldn't make him ugly because if he looked different all of a sudden Hal would get suspicious already and the story would be over. Either that or Mauricio was already ugly so he stayed the same? Haha...The trailers showed some of the really funny parts so it got kind of old to me yet everyone laughed which was kind of odd because they showed like the swimming pool scene where Rosemary splashes and the kid goes up in the tree in the commercial so many times i couldn't laugh at that scene, they should of saved that one for people who were going to see the entire movie. But it's okay, there are plenty of really funny scenes that the trailers didn't show i guess.The movie was kind of messed up because Hal only went out with Rosemary in the first place because he thought she was hot, The movie was kind of saying the real sexy people are mean and the not too attractive people are nice which isn't always trueDid you notice Hal's neighbor was pretty the entire movie? I guess she had both inner/outer beauty... She was mean at first because she thought Hal was the type of guy that was messed up but she realized his inner beauty without seeing him as a pretty boy, now that is true love.This movie is obviously not real, pretty messed up sometimes, but became serious at times which would probably save the movie from complaints unlike the 'Nutty Professor' which offended a lot of people.

With the camera switching between the two versions of Paltrow's Rosemary, the film certainly draws the viewers' attention to beauty being in the eyes of the beholder.  And the contradicting takes of Hal's observation of his female encounters absolutely support society's dimwitted judgment at oft times.

One freakish day, he gets locked in an elevator with `self-help guru' Tony Robbins who tells him that beautiful women aren't always as beautiful as their outer looks would depict. He tells Hal that he will unlock him from a deep sleep and he will see people through their inner beauty.Hal wanders out into the world a changed man as he starts going out with `ugly' women who have beautiful insides. Hal's friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander) is baffled to why his friend wants to date such `ugly' women especially when he hooks up with 300 pound Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow).`Shallow Hal' tries very hard to deliver a debate on beauty and I do admire its attempt to do so. On one hand it delivers an interesting argument but on the other it falls face flat into Hollywood's stereotyping of women.The film's good argument is that we as people only see what is skin deep and nothing beyond. But where is falls flat is that it never shows a person who has an inner and outer beauty which are the same. Are we all just shells hiding some other being within? When his hypnotism is lifted Hal doesn't recognize all the people he met under the hypnosis, why does this not occur when he was under the hypnosis? Also why does this phenomena only work on certain people? Shouldn't Hal be seeing the entire world as different?For what Gwyneth had to work with I do think she did a lovely job especially with her insecurities. I liked how she would question Black and his intentions. Her meek and pulled back approach is probably very close to what her character would be going through. I also liked Jason Alexander as Black's buddy.I have to say all the laughs in this film are in the trailer and the rest of the film is presented almost like a `light-hearted' debate. I am not sure if this film will alienate or hurt anyone but I am sure it will make some people uncomfortable. (2 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

Altruistic and humanistic both mean the same thing - unselfish, and concerned about the welfare of others. I think Hal means to say altruistic, and instead says altrudocious.

It wasn't Oscar-worthy, but it's a light-hearted romance/comedy played out by some great acting and costumes. This is the first time Jack Black made a positive impression on me (although he was fun in High Fidelity--just not a large role). Aside from his cuckoo clock impression, I thought his comedic and dramatic lines were equally enjoyable and convincing. Gwyneth is always sweet and funny and her comedic timing is right on. There are plenty of funny lines. There are also plenty of beautiful, charming actresses here. No nudity, no sex--just plain fun and warmth. And there are some touching moments with unfortunate children. I didn't find this movie offensive to overweight or less-than-appealing people. The people represented in this film are very exaggerated. These characters are also very comfortable with themselves. The message under the laughs is simple and obvious, but that's not what makes it a good film. And the ending is so touching and not entirely predictable. I watch it every time I catch it on the air.

Almost unrecognizable, she received negative, malevolent treatment from total strangers. People were not giving her the time of the day. Obesity is seen as a weakness or an embarrassment by the general population. Even though, the American population is getting more obese each day and not just by eating the wrong foods. One of the reasons I love this movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Rosemary gives her a heart and soul. You cannot help but like Rosemary. When Hal sees her under Tony Robbins spell, you begin to see a pattern. He sees other people in the same light. Their inner beauty comes alive. The most heart-wrenching scene is at the pediatric burn unit where he is comforting Cadence. It is perhaps my favorite scene in the movie. Hal becomes more human and falls in love with Rosemary even though he does not see the actual person until the end of the film. I cannot help but like this film for not trying to change Rosemary nor anybody else. It was Hal who needed to be changed. Love is blind until you see the inner beauty of your soulmate. This film is also good to watch to gain a better tolerance and understanding of obesity. You do not have to be physically beautiful to have inner beauty.

I'm definitely a fan of The Farrely Brothers, having enjoyed all of their films on different levels. Like most fans, my favorite film was obviously There's Something About Mary, and I always cited that film's romantic plot as the true enduring factor in its appeal. Sure, it was one of the funniest movies of all time, but we all have our own love story about some one from our past who we could never get over, and it was central to the film's humor and fundamental sweetness.If There's Something About Mary was sweet, then Shallow Hal is simply beautiful. Beautiful might seem like a strong word to use when describing a film from Peter and Bobby Farrely...God knows I'm the first person to admit that. But in truth, all of their films have been slightly romantic, from Dumb and Dumber right through Me, Myself, and Irene. And while Shallow Hal is certainly a comedy, I'd go so far as to say it's the best indication thus far that The Farrelys might just have a future outside of the comedy genre.The plot of the film is unnecessary, because it is given away in the trailer. And like another viewer mentioned, most of the laughs are given away too. However, it's not any big loss. The film has some big laughs, but it is really not as funny as I might have expected, and in all honesty it's probably the least amusing of the duo's films thus far. But here, the comedy is actually secondary...there are several long stretches where the film goes on with hardly an attempt to make the audience smile, let alone laugh. It really is THAT interested in the budding romance between the Hal and Rosemary.The theatrical trailer to this film has gotten a decided mixed response from audiences, prompting me to wonder if perhaps audiences are returning to their PC ways these days. A lot of people have expressed offense at the notion that a male hero can only find love with a woman if he views her as being a thin, blonde sex symbol. However, the trailer is wholly misleading. A lot of people may chuckle at the seriousness which I apply to the film, but it deserves to be taken seriously. With Shallow Hal, the Farrelys are exploring The American Male at its most, well, shallow. This is embodied through the characters of Hal and Mauricio, who are on the endless prowl for an aesthetically perfect female. For Hal, romantic feelings can only be understood through physical attraction...any spiritual or emotional fulfillment is completely foreign to him. The progression of the storyline challenges him to grasp that beauty and attraction without needing to see it in front of his eyes, but rather feeling it through his heart and soul.I know all of this sounds cheesy, and in truth, it is! But that's because Shallow Hal is, at its core, merely a good old fashioned love story...and an exceptionally beautiful one, I might add! This is largely thanks to a luminescent performance from Gwyneth Paltrow, who captures the role of Rosemary perfectly. Paltrow is a beautiful young woman, but its not her physical attractiveness that contributes to her characterization...in fact, she glows as much wearing a latex fat suit as she does in a mini skirt! She's simply wonderful in the film, and I would go so far as to call it one of her best performances. I cannot say that I was familiar with Jack Black prior to seeing the film, but he did a solid job with the title role. He's not quite Ben Stiller, but he was ideal for the role, a mass of vulnerability and naiveté glazed over by a bravado of not-so-assured confidence.However, the true stars of this film are Peter and Bobby Farrely. They have crafted a wonderfully enchanting modern fable, and given it just the right dose of humor to keep it from ever being preachy or offputting. Had this been done straight, it could have played like an afterschool special about body image and insecurity and purely intellectual love. In the hands of two comedic geniuses, it's a piece of cinema magic.I cannot say that Shallow Hal is a better love story than Moulin Rouge, but it's a damn close second. Although few people will admit to being as superficial as the lead character, many audience members actually are, and I am confident that a lot of people will come away from this movie with a new understanding for beauty and true love. You might not expect a whole lot from The Farrely Brothers by way of emotion and sentiment...but after this movie, I think everyone will.My Grade A-(It's worth noting that some critics who found the plot troubling were nonetheless quick to point out the relative unattractiveness of the leading male characters..a glaring example of hypocrisy  "},{"Title":"Pleasantly Surprised","Date":"10 November 2001","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  I went into this film knowing that it could be either really great or really tasteless.

Possibly many of the immature (i.e., the majority) moviegoers out there don't like to see a comedy that has a message, or, going the other way, a message movie with some comedic touches.  Cause that's what this is.  The Brothers Farrelly cannot seem to shed their penchant for bathroom humor but this time they've given you something to think about.  There is some meat on the bones of this movie.  You're supposed to think about it when its over, not like There's Something About Mary which was just a straight laugh riot. Hal is shallow (surprise) to the point of blindness and gets an emotional makeover when stuck in an elevator with Saturday morning infomercial god Anthony Robbins.  He 'casts a spell' so that Hal will only see the inner beauty in a person, or not see the outside but only see the inside..Then he meets Rosemary, who is overweight and pretty non-chalant about it. She knows who she is and how she appears and already knows what Hal just found out.  She volunteers at a hospital, is in the Peace Corps and gives leftovers to a homeless man.  She's a good person.  Hal's friend Mauricio is even worse, and he has less of a reason to be so quick to judge another person.  That's one of the main points, that Hal or Mauricio, or anyone for that matter, are far from perfect just like the entire human race, and this point is brought home when Mauricio refuses to date a woman whose second toe is longer than her big toe!  Meanwhile, he sprays his hair on, wears Members Only jackets and has a deformity that makes a big toe seem much more preferable.  So he's not really in any position to be so critical, but he is..This movie has a HUGE heart and I kind of can't believe that the Farrellys coaxed a tear from me, twice.  Once when Hal re-visits the pediatric ward at the childrens hospital, and again at the end. I don't even like Paltrow but she's fantastic in this.  So are Jack Black and Jason Alexander.

It's an unintelligent comedy of ridiculously high pretentiousness. Up to a certain point, I was able to use suspension of disbelief in an attempt to keep some kind of interest going, but I soon figured out that the movie had gone way too deep into mud to ever reach the surface again. The plotline reminds us that at their worst, people can be quite cruel and see only the bad in one another's appearance or the worst in one's traits. Actually, the plotline seems to want to raise the spectator's cynicism to maximum level, and it does a fair job at that. However, once your trust in the goodness in man's hearts has vanished, you'd expect that,in the end, there will be a convincing argument to unravel this web of dismay and maybe even give you a glimmer of hope that people can really change for the better. The argument does come, but it's not convincing at all. In the end, you'll find that if this movie had a message, it never got sent.

The message is almost pornographic. This confuses young Hal, who is all of age ten, since dad had always been an upright citizen and a preacher too. Hal blocks this shocking scene out of his conscious mind, but the message becomes the ruler of his subconscious. As a result, as an adult, he is constantly going to bars with his equally shallow pal (Jason Alexander as Mauricio) and trying to chat up and dance with girls way out of his league, and he's not even subtle about it.Fate changes when Hal gets stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins who puts him under a spell that will make him see only the inner beauty in people, not the external packaging. He winds up catching a glimpse of Rosemary Shanahan, who has a beautiful soul, but is also 300 pounds. At first she thinks he is just making fun of her, but when she finds out his interest is real they start seeing each other. The catch here? Her dad is Hal's boss, and he's been getting nowhere lately getting a promotion at work. One day when Hal and Rosemary come over to her house Hal ends up talking one on one with the boss, and ends up getting the promotion he's been wanting. Of course his coworkers see his progress, see him cozying up to Rosemary and think that he is lower than lice - using the girl to advance his career. As for Mauricio, he goes in search of Tony Robbins to try and undo whatever spell has been cast on his friend, because it is disrupting his social life and Hal's new aesthetics makes no sense to him.When Hal is put back to normal, everybody now looks how they did before. Their physical being is what he sees. This means that he is doing everything he can to not actually see Rosemary since he is in love with her and doesn't want to lose that feeling. From Rosemary's end it looks like Hal got his promotion and is done with her. This is the same opinion that his new boss - who for some reason doesn't fire him - and his coworkers have. How will all of this work out? Watch and find out.There is plenty of low brow humor here, but it is seasoned with a bit of empathy...EXCEPT that the film still indicates that being overweight is just about the worst thing that could happen to someone AND that the reason for that is always out of control gluttony. In other words if you are not a size five it is your own fault. I've never been a fan of Jack Black but I think he did a good job here.

Jack Black stars as Hal, a womaniser who only goes for the best looking women but is hypnotised to fin a woman's inner beauty instead. Hal then meets an obese woman, Rosemary, played by Paltrow, and the two start going out.Since Hal's perception of women has been altered he can only see beautiful people. So instead of seeing the 'real' figure of Rosemary he sees an attractive woman which is why he chooses her.Its an extremely predictable film with terrible acting. Paltrow is always trying to recover her ground and create sympathy which never works. Jack Black disappointed me most of all because he was given a character who cannot be funny as much as he tried. EVERY SINGLE joke in this film is predictable and amazingly unfunny, I could not bring myself to laugh as much as I tried, it's a one liner joke all the way through and in one word is disgraceful, for actors of the quality in Black and Paltrow it is such a step down for the pair.The story is very captive of real life and flows well with healthy relationships between characters but again I must stress that it is very predictable and not funny in this slightest. It is actually very sick minded with fat jokes streaming continuously from the characters.The beginning is awful &#150; where it should be really emotional it is supposedly funny and makes me cry with disappointment that a real emotional scene has been created to sound funny and I was put off from that scene &#150; the young Hal with his father in the hospital bed.Its likable in the sense that it is very captive of real life and shows that there are characters like that out there who are exceptionally rude and arrogant. The ending provides a few twists which many may have seen coming but are likable and is emotional &#150; and is the only reason why this film receives a 6 &#150; because it is emotional and audiences may question what is happening Heavy critics may see the ending as tacky and clichéd but I found it enlightening Worth watching if you have nothing else to do &#150; not a film I would recommended to watch on a date - watch 'when Harry met sally' which is laughable, predictable but that IS funny and contains good acting &#150; unlike Shallow Hal which for me was a disappointment to what I was expecting "},{"Title":"Vintage Farrelly","Date":"18 October 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Hal Larson as a young kid gets advice from his dying father not to settle for anything less than quality killer trim.

This film wants to have it's lard and eat it too by inserting a Don Rickles type ending onto the film wherein after spending the majority of the act making fun of people, at the end of the act refuses to diffuse the situation by saying ..But really we are all brothers under our skin.

Under a lot of morphine his reverend father tells him to go after the important things in life like beautiful women with big titties, nice body etc. This explains why shallow Hal was well------Shallow! He is only able to see women as sexual beings and can not see past their physical beauty. One day he gets stuck in the elevator with a talk show host( a huge hulk of a man!). Anyhow he somehow hypnotizes Hal enabling him to see beyond a women's 'outer beauty' and see 'the beauty within'. As a result, he is seeing fat or homely women as beautiful models. This is not exactly my favorite Farrelly brothers movie (that would probably be Outside Providence)but the outcome of his 'hypotnotic' state does have some funny results. Jack Black and Gwyneth Paltrow both give good performances. This movie also goes beyond just plain slapstick comedy. It does have some touching moments and teaches a moral lesson.

The accidents were things that could happen to anyone and the teasing and name calling featured was, for the most part, similar to things I know I've heard before.Deep down the character Hal (played by Jack Black) learned a great lesson in looking deeper inside a person for their inner beauty, instead of totally basing a relationship on the person's outer beauty.It was a well acted and quirky little comedy.

The nice idea is great. We meet Black that only sees women from their looks, but so he learns something from a famous psycho doctor. He learns him how to see inside people, and see the inside as their looks. Black learns this, and soon he sees all the fat women as slim and sexy. All the smoking women as flash points. And so on...It's a funny comedy, although it hasn't got the extra touch that would have made it a very good comedy. Jack Black is as always very good in his character, he never fails. Paltrow is okay, although she fails a lot more than she succeeds. And, when you have this plot going, there are off course easy to put on all of these ideas. Like them having a milkshake together and Black looks out the window for a moment, and when he is about to drink it's all gone cause of Paltrow! Or when Black is laying in the bed waiting for Paltrow, he sees this thin lady and her small panties, and he tells him to take them off. So she does, and throws it to him, although the panties look small and cute to him, they're really huge!It's a very entertaining movie, although it never gets that nice touch that would have helped it a lot in its way.

A lot of attractive women are decidedly lacking in the intelligence and personality departments. For about the first 15 minutes this film seems to demonstrate these lessons, but then rather contradicts its own message about looking beyond the surface at inner beauty when Hal is obsessed by what he sees as ideal looking women.I would have thought that in America these days obese people are so common that they wouldn't get derided the way that Rosemary does, although if it's a result of being such a glutton you can't help feeling that she deserves it. The various scenes of Gwyneth Paltrow in scantily clad poses (and some of the supporting actresses) make this film nice to look at, but like many American comedies it suffers from excruciating characters (here Hal's man friend particularly) and over-the-top/in-your-face gags.

This is pretty typical of the Farelly brothers, as we can see with their recent film, Stuck On You.The film claims sensitivity and understanding as its selling points. The narrative does not really lead us to feel compassion for fat people at all though. Our central character, brilliant played by Jack Black, is shallow as it gets, and although we can see this, and see him for the fool that he is, we also do not suddenly want to date someone who is 350 pounds. The in jokes about pets, namely dogs, are suggestive about women, or large women, for the wrong reasons. The fact that the girl who lives over the hall is still as beautiful when Jack is hypnotised is also pretty important.Forget the sensitivity loss though, if you can watch this film and ignore the points they are making, it can make for good light entertainment.

If a twenty stone woman lay on top of you I'm sure that you wouldn't think she was Gwyneth Paltrow!While this sort of material plays well on TV, it must look very thin on the big screen.

This is laughs of a TV level and given that so many Americans are overweight, hitting out at quite a number of the target audience.Jack Black makes the most of probably the only starring role he will ever have and Paltrow doing nothing but mouthing words is worth watching, but otherwise the cupboard is bare.What is the message, that being overweight is OK as long as you are a nice person underneath? What about the health dangers? What about the limits it puts on your life?

With even their best and funniest movies - Kingpin and the modern classic 'There's Something About Mary' - the comedy is forced, the slapstick is strained. There targets are stationary and get as much mileage as they can out of simply being politically incorrect. They have a scripted feel and don't flow as effortlessly as a great comedy would. I rarely find myself in a fit of hysterics over the Farrelly brother movies. And yet, very often I am thoroughly entertained by them. Mary had a few expertly crafted scenes that you had to laugh at for their sheer audacity, but I dug that movie more for it's story - a heartfelt and realistic romantic comedy. When you hear a Farrelly brother movie talk about love you get the sense that they know what they're talking about, instead of just recycling stock Hollywood romantic comedy cliches. They are really better as storytellers. All of this applies to 'Shallow Hal'. It isn't particularly funny in any part (beyond Jason Alexander's  delivery of the world's funniest Who Let the Dogs Out reference...it was a song at the time) and it's comedic foils are age-old fat jokes (chairs breaking, etc.). However, it is sweet and honest in it's modest delivery - a romantic comedy for the romantically challenged. It also sports the most creative and original story of any Farrelly brother movie and one of the best I have had the pleasure to write about. You know what it's about, right? Chauvinistic Hal gets hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty in people and ends up dating plus-size (to be kind) Rosemary to the shock and horror of his friends. Instead of making this a simple plot gimmick the brothers delve into it with some sly symbolic commentary on the brainwashing of consumerism and the how unreliable our own perceptions can be in this appearance oriented, materialistic culture. Don't you think you've been brainwashed? Tony Robbins says at one point. This is a topic usually taken on by women referring to the wire-frame look of fashion models. As the Farrellys always do, Shallow Hal is a guy movie making it's points from an average Joe perspective. The script is both about Rosemary's challenge to find someone who will see her beyond her appearance AND Hal being forced to face the reality of his own appearance and that he, himself, may need to discard the universal male dream of getting a gorgeous women. That element is rarely mentioned in most reviews of this movie who only focus on Rosemary's plight. All of this is done so slightly that it might fly over the heads of those just plopped in the seats to see fat jokes. In their premise they create a universe of rules and cleverly stick by them. The movie starts to drag quite a bit at it's 2 hour running time and builds to an anti-climax. But it's still fascinating to see the story play fully out. One of the other things the brothers do so well is casting. Jack Black is offbeat, but pitch-perfect as our hero. As the movie progresses Hal grows and Black's performance gains depth instead of always playing for the laugh. Jason Alexander is once again in the side-kick role, but successfully miles away from George Costanza. Any beautiful actress probably would have worked for the female lead. Paltrow holds her own, but it's all about the 2 guys. Another thing you can almost always count on from the Farrelly's is a terrific soundtrack. Here the score is wonderfully peppered with songs by Ivy and the credits pop with Edison Lighthouse's Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes and Cake's Comfort Eagle - both with lyrics perfectly in fitting with the movie's themes. The boy's second best film to date.Have you been brain-washed today?

So the movie conveys a very good message and it is indeed very cute. It jabs basically at everyone's instinct and then does a good cute at your ego with a scene where the little kid Jack Black hung out with turns out to be a burn victim. Truth be told, the movie isn't really that funny. It's like if you put Jack Black in 'Pay It Forward'. Mix together the depression of 'Pay It Forward' with the comedy of Jack Black and you have an oddity of a movie..your pretty sure your supposed to laugh but you'll mostly just be disturbed. So in between Jack Black's stoner humor and insane antics and a extremely moral and yet depressing movie you need humor...where's the balance? Jason Alexander, who is the only REALLY funny part of the movie and delivers most of the laughs. The Farrelly brothers prove they can be very sad as well as very funny. So maybe this balances out the rauncyness of 'Theres something About Mary'. Maybe they felt they had to balance that out. I don't know. But the movie gets a six from me, if for anything just for the part with the wagging tale which stays true to Farrelly's common motif of human oddities. The movie is worth watching but you won't want to watch it again. I like it when the Farrelly Brothers make me happy but I guess they can make me kinda-sad too. The movie is worth watching but gets six stars. Cute and twisted but not what I wanted from the Brothers 'F'.

Jack Black is short and pudgy with bulldog features, and Jason Alexander looks like something that's been boiled and painted.  Why is their lack of attractiveness never part of the plot?  Good Lord, they roam around the movie looking for babes as if they were a couple of Adonises.  Both of these distinctly not good-looking guys get pursued by attractive women, and what's more, the squat four-eyes actually turns down his dolly on the grounds that she's got a long toe.  (All this is later justified by his inner hurt feeling...awwwww!!)Another sign that the movie was put together by a couple of cases of arrested development Rosemary never stops talking about her low self-esteem, can't handle compliments, etc. yet in every second scene she's wearing something short and tight.

This is one rare film in which someone who is obese gets a little recognition for being a nice person.  There's nothing wrong with that part of it.  Beauty is something that we have defined.  It's subjective, not objective.  This movie shows just how despicable we are to judge on the basis of looks alone.  This was an odd movie.  The secret that Jason Alexander's character shares with us toward the end was a little disturbing in my opinion.  It's one of the only things I took from this movie, and I doubt that was the intention.  I thought this would be a great comedy, but I found it to be more disgusting than funny.  Everybody was so shallow, and I bet people think it's okay.  It's not funny; it's just the way things are.  The fat gal had low self-esteem.  Even her dad said something about her.  They couldn't just make the lady a little big.  She had to be huge.  The hospital scenes were just wrong in my opinion.  Seeing some guy walk around on all fours is not funny.  I just want to forget this movie.  This is more about shaming than making us laugh.  There's no lesson.  It's just a reminder of how things are.  The ending is unrealistic, though.

From the little I had heard, it couldn't be good, but my wife rented the DVD so what the heck? I watched it. The Farrelly brothers have been uneven, at best, with their non-PC films. Dumb and Dumber and What About Mary are two of my favorites, while Me, Myself, and Irene is one of the most offensive and un-funny excuses of a movie I've ever seen. Shallow Hal falls somewhere between those extremes. While people of size may have a legitimate gripe about this film, because it says no normal person could possibly find them attractive, it is pretty close to the truth. But it also shows an anorexic woman in an equally bad light.  So, if one can get beyond that faux pas then Shallow Hal can be a very entertaining movie. But just good, not superb.SPOILERS - Hal (Jack Black) was told as a young boy by his dying father, Life is too short, devote all your attention to the really beautiful and well-built women.  As an adult he didn't remember the conversation, but the advice stuck. Hal is as shallow as they get, and is constantly rejected by the beautiful ladies. But a chance encounter in a broken elevator with Tony Robbins changes all that. Hal began to see everyone for their inner beauty and when he meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), a 300+ pound fatty who eats everything she sees, he sees is a svelte beauty. When he meets a couple of her ugly and overweight friends who do Peace Corps work, all he sees are handsome guys. When he meets a beautiful girl dating his crippled friend for money, all he sees is a skinny, ugly woman.His good friend (Jason Alexander) panics at this changed Hal and has Tony Robbins give him the phrase to change him back, but the brief time under the spell has changed Hal for good. He fell in love with Rosemary and even as the fatty she is, he proclaims that they will never be separated.Meanwhile, his friend confides his own phobia to Hal. He was born with a partial tail, and in a funny scene pulls down his pants and underwear just far enough that we see this short skin-covered tail that wags when he gets excited. At the end we see him meet a pretty lady carrying a dog, they turn and walk off togther, his tail wagging under his pants.Their comedy is very inventive and, when they don't cross the line into very bad taste (as they did in Irene), the Farrelly Brothers make very entertaining films. This is one of them. I rate it 7 of 10.

(It's basically just a bunch of jokes at an obese person's expense.)  I realize now that they *had* to market this one as a lowbrow comedy because it probably wouldn't sell on its main moral A regular, shallow guy starts to see the inner beauty of new people he meets, and changes his tune about how he judges people by their beautiful exteriors.   This message is enhanced and paralleled by the presence of Tony Robbins, whom some people know only as an inspirational voice they have heard on cassette tapes, and will be startled by his real-life appearance.  (I sure was.  Would you ever have suspected him to be that tall??)  Robbins does a fair job on the acting, sounding exactly as he does in his seminars, and adds realism to the movie.  Jack Black's performance is passable but nothing special-- More of note are the many young ladies who accurately convey the low self-esteem that is so pervasive among the not traditionally attractive crowd.  Low self-esteem is a way of life for homely people, but must be challenging to mimic for an actress like Paltrow. Shallow Hal has an achingly pedestrian beginning, but swiftly delves into new territory and even brings up long-standing but never-resolved real-life issues like1. Why is it that average (or even downright unattractive) people often hit on beautiful people and expect positive results?  Why don't people focus on those who are within their league?  Everybody is fully aware of the guidelines of the Social Pyramid-- relationships between people who occupy radically different levels of the Pyramid are often a waste of time, or end badly, or are based on unscrupulous goals... so why do people go out of their way to try it?  Nobody benefits.  It just confuses everybody and compromises the structural integrity of the Pyramid.  And why does Hollywood usually endorse this by pairing average-looking, or much older actors with 30-something supermodels?  And why do so many actors actually *buy* this idea and apply it (needless to say, unsuccessfully) to their personal lives?2.  Why is it that so-called unattractive people often have the most beautiful personalities?  And vice versa?  At the very least, it tends to be the unattractive who are the most intelligent.  The irony of it all is that it is the outcasts, the nerds, the uglies, the social rejects, who usually have the greatest ideas and produce the most successful inventions, to the benefit of all the attractive socialites who rejected them in the first place.     Shallow Hal is a comment on these ideas, particularly in the realm of social betterment, as most of the unattractive people are the ones doing volunteer work at the hospital, joining the Peace Corps and helping out their sick grandmothers.  This is a poignant movie to the end that its occasional attempts at humor feel very out of place (They are usually just slight jabs at obesity) amid the serious commentary.  The *real* humor is seeing how confused Hal gets when everyone acts weird around the girls he's associating with, and even this is a smart comment on the film's maxim, Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder.  Even better news is that there is very little vulgarity to sit through, and the film is delightfully shocking (One scene will likely evoke tears.) in its bold approach to a subject matter that Hollywood is generally reluctant to address.

I just had the feeling that the film could have done so much more if it would have decided to be either Drama or Comedy (though I'm glad that they didn't make `There is something about Mary' type).  The cutting of the film also irritated me (as so often with &#145;this sort' of comedies these days), were the whole film is build up of small scenes then pasted together at the end.  There is a lack of continuity between scenes, though the film as whole pulls it off.  Finally, I felt they went a bit overboard to get a point across.

There's plenty of the Farrellys' trademark good-natured ribbing of deformity (here it's spina bifida) and weirdo gags (the best one involving an overgrown spine) but the film as a whole doesn't revel in the bile that pushed `Me, Myself & Irene' over the edge into discomfort (especially concerning its racial attitudes). It's also not as laugh-out-loud funny as `There's Something About Mary', preferring to concentrate on pacing and motivation--but that works towards a more satisfying film it has less of the dead spots that the outrageousness compensated for in `Mary'. Black is a surprise in a lead role he delivers his lines with an unexpected sweetness and sincerity that belies his non-leading-man looks. With Gwyneth Paltrow as the object of Black's desires; even though she spends much of the film playing a grossly obese woman, she still plays it straight, leaving the humor to Black and Jason Alexander (as his best friend) and the Farrellys' sight gags. `Shallow Hal' will probably put off some Farrelly Brothers fans for not being funny enough, but it represents a great step forward for them as real filmmakers.

But when you go see a movie at the theater, you're buying an experience, in addition to the movie. Certain movies don't lend themselves well to that experience package, and are best viewed at home on a rainy afternoon.Shallow Hal falls into this category. Everyone gives strong performances, but especially Gwennyth (of course, she could belch, and I'd call it a strong performance hehe.) But Jack Black is dead-on as the dweeby guy who tries to hump girls' legs on the club floor, but is a decent person underneath it all. Jason Alexander is good, too, finally shaking off his George Castanza routine. Even bizarre self-help cyborg Tony Robbins gets a few laughs when he hypnotizes Hal. All in all, this movie is very enjoyable, but you have to ignore the marketing they used to promote it. Yes, it's a comedy, but it's more enjoyable and good-natured than it is funny.

I felt the makers of this movie didn't really know where they wanted to go with it. Or perhaps they didn't want to step on anybody's toes. At times it seemed it was going to go too far but then in jumps back into political correctness. Now, there are some funny moments in Shallow Hal, but they are far and few between. For the most part the movie is rather slow and just seems to meander for a while. There are moments in the film that seem on the edge of true creativity and intelligence but then it wallows again and it gets kind of boring. I thought Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jason Alexander did ok jobs, considering the lack of material and direction. The make-up effects are, unfortunately, the best part of the movie.

Hal then falls for rather overweight woman named Rosemary.  The movie leaves me, and probably most of the other people who saw this movie, with one question Do looks matter?  That is a very hard question to answer, and can be answered with a yes and no.  If one were to look at the issue from a personality perspective, then no, looks do not matter if the person has a good personality.  On the other hand, looks do matter when looked at from a health perspective.  The simple truth is that being overweight is not healthy.  I know that ,in this society, it is unfair and impossible for some women to live up to the thin supermodels that they see in the media, but, as I said before, being overweight is not healthy.  My point is that people that are overweight should not be ridiculed because of what they look like on the outside.

As a woman of similar proportions to Rosemary in the film I was interested to see how the previously grossly insensitive directors would treat the subject of obesity and 'inner beauty'. I have to say having seen the film and am hopelessly divided on my feelings for it. Half of me feels they were still poking fun at fat people (furniture collapsing, big splashes in the swimming pool etc.) and yet it seems the sentiment is in fact altruistic. Hal is shallow and not particularly physically attractive but is described as having hopelessly high standards when it comes to women. He will only approach very attractive women and as a result is often knocked back.After he is hypnotised by a self-help guru he is only being to see people's inner beauty, he meets Rosemary, the overweight daughter of his boss. She is funny, intelligent and kind and Hal is soon hooked. There is much reference in this film to attractive women being unfunny and not terribly interesting. Are the directors trying to redress the balance or is that reading too much in to an essentially lighthearted comedy? Oddly as the story progresses and thus the characterisation I found that Hal became more attractive. Perhaps I was also discovering his inner beauty. Gwyneth is without a doubt utterly beautiful but my main concern was how horrid she looked in the 'fat suit' (Worse than Julia Roberts in America's Sweetheart's). Fat people are NOT uniformly unattractive or ugly just as beautiful women are not all stupid and pointless. The Campaign of Fat Acceptance were outraged by the concept of the fat suit - comparing it to 'blacking up' a white actress. I'm not convinced that this attitude promotes acceptance. I admire the Farrelly brothers for taking this subject head on and I believe the message of the film is ultimately good.

He does see the Paltrow character as thin, but this is during his shallow phase.  Hal goes through and enormous change in heart through the whole movie. In the beginning he's only attracted to thin woman, and this is a major flaw in him (as nearly everyone  in the movie points out).  But many admit that this is about his only flaw (except being a little hefty himself), since overall he's a nice guy.  When he's hypnotized, he views people's souls as  attractive, but still he is unaware of this and is still in his shallow phase.  Thus he's still attracted to thin people and thus attracted to Rosemary, but when they meet they hit it off because she's a nice person and he's a nice person.When he is turned back to normal, he doesn't insult those who now look unattractive to him, he actually shows compassion for them.  The best scene in the entire movie is at the burn ward, where he says with his whole heart that the girl is beautiful.  And it's true.In the final scene he meets up with Rosemary for the first/last time as obese, and he does not see an unattractive girl.  If I was an obese woman, I would not mind this movie at all, nor think that a good man like Hal would only like me if I first looked like Gwyneth Paltrow.

The films' premise was simple enough.  Jack Black plays Hal Larson who together with Jason Alexander as Mauricio Wilson, play two very sexist young men. They always judge women just on appearances. Then one fateful day Hal meets famous guru Anthony Robbins who puts some kind of spell on him where he is able to look beyond physical appearances and see womens' beauty inside. Hal's spell takes the shape of falling in love with the 300 pound Rosemary Shanahan, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Whilst everyone else sees this hugely obese woman Hal sees Rosemary only as a figure of beauty. This conceit does provide for some of the films richest comedy. For what's its worth, my verdict on 'Shallow Hal'. Its an enjoyable enough film with an appealing message. Many people may be put off by its simmplistic style, but its entertaining and the performances are good. Most of all its heart is in the right place!

It gets us to pull for the right characters, and for a while we have a refreshed view of the world. To the extent that it tells us that obese people need love and compassion too, its message is unassailable. But it tries to tell us more than that, namely (1) There's a right person for everybody, and (2) our wrong-headed expectations are what prevent us from getting paired with our right persons. But I think I speak for a whole lot of us when I say we can rightfully feel put-upon by (2) and less than giddily optimistic about (1). SHALLOW HAL it turns out is more of a fairy tale than Cinderella; I'd have said that in my summary above, but for the fact that one can't give adequate warning of spoilers if they're alluded to in the summary. The movie has extensive parallels with Cinderella. A minor difference is this time its the guy who needs special intervention from someone in a role parallel to the fairy godmother. Supplying that role this time is a self-help guru who hypnotizes Hal, enabling him to be attracted to Rosemary by seeing her as slim when she's actually very fat. We're told this means Hal sees folks only in their inner beauty; whether that's exactly accurate or not, well, you decide. But the major difference from the Cinderela story is this -- the things challenging Cinderella to get up with her prince are purely logistical, making them very unlikely to meet at all until the fairy godmother arranges for Cinderella to attend the ball. Once there, her innate charms and sweetness are altogether sufficient to win the prince. What held her back -- low social status and stepsisters' cruel machinations  -- can all be left behind once she moves into the prince's palace. But for Hal and Rosemary, their happily ever after is much more challenged. Hal will ultimately have to accept Rosemary's true physical dimensions, the original barrier, undiminished. We buy into the stoy briefly, and fancy the world a better place for it for a while, just as Hal saw Rosemary differently for a while. But we soon must come down to reality. In the real world the obese and other conventionally unattractive people will remain as attractiveness-challenged as ever. We remain as unequal to one another as ever in our prospects for happily ever after.

Prepare yourself for the usual onslaught of mucus and flatulence.  But wait, is there something more here?  Are these the same Farrelly brothers, or have the sophomoric pranks been traded in for a more tender version, the decaffeinated diet soda of vulgarity?Over the years, the Farrelly brothers have laudably explored important and socially relevant discipline such as laxative overdoses or the classic struggle of zipper versus genitals (see `Dumb and Dumber' and `There's Something About Mary', respectively), subjecting all-too-willing audiences to their brand of gross-out humor, the train wreck of comedy from which no one can seem to turn away.  `Shallow Hal' offers the first glimpse into a toned-down comedy for the Farrellys.  They have attempted to maintain the zany and obscene circus of characters, while integrating a humanistic sermon on the morals of accepting other's imperfections.  It's a harsh contradiction of principles that makes the audience remember that after school specials on bulimia or genetic diseases were intentionally humorless.The caustically comical, Energizer-bunny-possessed Jack Black once again works his infectious enthusiasm and wacky facial expressions to a full roar. He stars as the incorrigibly superficial but helplessly insecure Hal, a social canker sore of a human being whose biggest concern is finding the perfect supermodel typecast girlfriend, with all the silicone, pre-waxed parts, and accessory factory options.  After being trapped in an elevator with self-motivating guru Tony Robbins, the cure-all master infects Hal with a counterpoison hypnosis, from then on rendering him only able to see someone for their `inner beauty'.  Enter Gwyneth Paltrow, in an acting stretch of sorts.  The aesthetically sublime beauty transforms herself into, well, exactly that, a ray of perfection that supposedly translates the adorned radiance of her character, Rosemary Shanihan, if only one could peel off the outer layers.  Paltrow must act fat without being fat, all the while trying not to feel sorry for a character that engages the sympathy of the audience.The Farrelly brothers are expert in simultaneously extorting sympathy and laughs from the audience for characters with physical or mental shortcomings, or simply any distinction with which most cannot identify. But this film tackles issues more sensitive and far more cosmopolitan (and therefore innately untouchable) than being albino, Amish, or schizophrenic. After Paltrow reveals the ridiculous and visually ineffectual body suit, the subject matter might suggest that it is better left unexplored.Of course, it was intended that Gwyneth display the physical manifestation of  Rosemary's inside nobility. For most of the film, Paltrow shares the screen with the overweight Rosemary body double, filmed with crafty camera angles and subversive plot intervention that allows us to only see the version of Rosemary that Hal fabricates.  The Farrellys were possibly too busy wondering if they could accurately portray this idea that they didn't stop to consider if they should.In the end, the directors are guilty of the very indecorum they were trying to denounce, as the self-deprecating jokes turn against them and you begin to wonder if `Shallow Hal' is a farce of itself.  There were definitely too many broken furniture jokes (one would have been too many), and watching tiny Gwyneth, as obese Rosemary, ingest large quantities of sweets only perpetuates a tasteless stereotype.  A greater pitfall, and even more obviously narrow-minded, is the notion that true beauty can only be portrayed as thin, young, and unblemished.  Why does everyone's inner beauty look like an Abercrombie and Fitch advertisement?Lost in the morals is perhaps what would be on the surface a top-notch comedy, though not quite as funny as their previous films.  The plot does thicken at the end, branching out to include a whole cast of misfits that force the main characters to confront their own flaws.  Especially memorable is the physical anomaly of Mauricio (Jason Alexander), Hal's relationship advisor and confidant, which will remain as memorable as any gag the Farrellys have ever pulled off.Take this one with a grain of salt.  Give this film the benefit of doubt, assuming that it was intended to offend you all along.  Like all of their previous assaults on human nature, this comedy seeks to entertain, with little discretion, rather than preach.

He starts out as a night club reject, intent on attracting only the most attractive out-of-his-reach women.  A chance meeting with self help guru Tony Robbins sparks a hypnotic transformation in Shallow Hal, who learns to see the inner beauty in people - thus altering his physical perception of them as well.  Along comes the sweet, shy and pretty Gweneth Paltrow of whom Hal falls madly in love with.  The gags of this film are fairly basic. While the rest of the world sees Gweneth's character as an overweight person, Hal is blinded by his hypnosis and sees her as thin and attractive.  Both Paltrow and Black play their parts with sincerity and sensitivity.  There are numerous gags in the film which are not very sensitive, and poke fun at the comical mishaps of an obese woman.  While the jokes are fairly funny, they are somewhat embarasing to watch, and the real tone of this film becomes clear.  You may find yourself laughing that some of the mishaps, but begin to feel increasingly guilty for doing so.  When Hal finally snaps out of his hypnotic state and sees Paltrow's character as she really is, his knee-jerk reaction is to run the other way.  The movie really centers on how shallow, judgmental and insensitive our society is.  Its a moral fable that not only says beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but also that it's deeper than skin deep.  Shallow Hal is more of a social commentary with a good message than a knee-slapping care-not comedy.

One day when he was going home from work, he got trapped in an elevator with this guy who gives pep talks.  Hal told the guy about his problem with ladies.  Then, the pep talk guy told Hal he's going to give him a very special ability to 'see' the inner beauty of the ladies to him are ugly.  Afterwards, every ugly lady to him is seen as 'hot' through his eyes.  The next day, he met a 300 pound girl named Rosemary.

Hal and Rosemary dated for awhile until he realizes what has happened.  That he was putted under some sorta spell.  And I don't want to ruin the ending.

Think again.This is not a typical Farrelly film. Shallow Hal has more morality and more warmth to be that. Many have complained that this film was offensive to fat people. These people must have seen this film with a mission to complain, because the film does quite the contrary. It states that inner beauty is more valuable than looks. Sure, there are times you are forced to laugh at some of the scenes, but they have been included to show that it is quite alright to laugh when funny things happen as long as you are aware of the inner qualities of people. That being said, this is not very funny. It is not meant to be either, but it is still supposed to be a comedy, and it contains too few laughs. Actually, I believe the irony of the film is that it tries too much not to be offensive. It still achieves to offend people and loses touch with the intended audience who is not easily offended. The film tries to be romantic and warm the last half and it sort of succeeds at this, but then the Farrelly's couldn't help themselves and threw in an unnecessary kissing scene with the wrong woman and also the strangest tail in film history.All in all a valid effort, but it is too untidy.Rating 6/10 "}{"Title":"Somewhat disappointing","Date":"18 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  The previews for Shallow Hal were plastered all over television and in magazines.

You'd have a bulldog dressed up as a gangster, a poodle as his moll, and so forth.  Pretty darn funny to see, even now, and a darn sight funnier looking at them now than their human contemporary comedies.Shallow Hal also belongs in its own category.  Instead of dogs, it uses outrageously unattractive people (or, rather, people made out to look unattractive) to represent archetypes of good and bad.  In doing so, it tackles obesity head on, a very sensitive subject for some.  Ultimately, it approaches this non-politically-correct topic in a politically correct fashion.  I class it with movies that tackle serious issues like racism and racial prejudice head on.  Those movies (think To Kill a Mockingbird, though Hal is nowhere near the quality of that classic) get notoriety, protests, controversy, respect.  This movie will pretty much disappear without a trace.Why?  Well, it is marketed as a comedy, and, indeed, it is funny in parts.  You certainly can tell when you are supposed to laugh, even if you don't (such as when Jack Black does his amazingly unfunny cuckoo impression one too many times).  There are, indeed, a few hilarious moments if you are in the right frame of mind (the Devils come out! line was completely unexpected and out of character and, thus, superb).  The trailer captures the vast majority of the real laughs.Comedy designation or not, Hal turns into something much different.  It has a sensitivity about human feelings that only belongs in a serious movie.  It is as if the actors or writers slowly realized during the filming that this is a topic that can hurt a lot of people, so joking about it is not the right angle.  It would be like joking about racism.  That can work if done properly, but not when you poke fun only at real and obvious victims of racism.  Poking fun at the, if you will, victims of obesity comes to seem petty and lame.So, what are you left with?  An unfunny comedy?  Well, it would be easy to think that if bought your ticket - encouraged by the misleading ad campaign - expecting to bust a gut.  You won't.  Instead, you will see a fairly charming and introspective look at all of our human frailty, where characters are forced to look inside themselves to find out of what they are made.  Sounds fairly pat - appearances can be deceiving and all that - but it is all done in a good-natured way.  The fact that there are not political activists out there roiling the waters about this particular topic pretty much assures that it will not become any kind of cultural touchstone, though.  It will at most just be a guilty pleasure for some.None of the acting particularly impressed me.  Some of the people who were supposed to be physically ugly in fact looked kind of normal - which is a real commentary on how Hollywood itself views the world.  A little Jack Black goes a long, long way.  Jason Alexander was much better toward the end, playing the schlemiel who knows he's a schlemiel, than at the beginning, where he is just plain annoying.  As for Gwyneth Paltrow, how she wandered into this film is a mystery.  Rene Kirby steals every scene he can, and embodies the real moral lesson of the film.I noticed that some, ahem, overweight moviegoers were not laughing.  They took it quite seriously.  I think this kind of film rattles some cages.  Any movie that succeeds in doing that isn't all bad.  Compared with the utter mindlessness of Harry Potter, Legally Blonde, Bandits and the like, this is serious stuff.  There is a need for that in this day and age when sophomoric trifles are held up as the height of film-making.  I give Hal a 6/10 for sheer audacity in unexpectedly leading the viewer to think about a serious topic, albeit in a, well, shallow way.  Oh, and stay through the credits, which display some funny bits and fancy skiing from someone unexpected.

This would probably rank as their least funniest film, but ranks pretty good in the storytelling department. They managed to tackle a difficult subject that many people would find offensive and surprisingly deal with it in a tasteful manner.I must admit that before seeing this movie, I was mentally preparing myself to witness an endless barrage of crude 'fat jokes' and tiresome 'breaking chairs' gags. While some of these points are touched in 'SHALLOW HAL', it is more than just a film about fat people and their foibles, but also their feelings and that they, like you and me, should also be treated with human decency and respect.Jack Black (one half of the cult favorite band 'Tenacious D') surprisingly pulls off a very good performance as Hal Larson, the character referred to in the title of this movie and also the bigger high-light of the film when placed next to Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow. He is as shallow as any pig can get. He only looks at attractive girls and refuses to settle for anything less. Much of this superficial attitude can be traced to his father's dying words to him when he was 12 years old. His father begs him not to settle for anything less than perfect like he apparently did with Jack's mother (played in a small cameo by Molly Shannon).Hal spends most of his spare time at the dance clubs, oggling attractive women who wouldn't give him the time of day even if his life depended on it. Hal himself isn't anything 'great' to look at it. He is a little overweight, could use a haircut and he hangs around with a jerk for a best friend, wonderfully played in a stereo-type cast role that will haunt him forever, Jason Alexander (a.k.a. George from 'SEINFELD'). Actually, in 'SHALLOW HAL', Jason Alexander plays a character so foul and sarcastic that you can't help but despise him every time you see him on-screen.When Hal boasts to a self-help guru (played by Tony Robbins as himself) that he has been cursed with 'ultra shallowness', Tony Robbins performs a quick hypnotic trick on him that releases him of his shallowness where he can now only see the 'inner beauty' of everyone he meets. The women Hal meets from hereon in the film are all beautiful. To the common person, she is either very plain looking or extremely unattractive. To Hal, she is his dream goddess.Enter Gwyneth Paltrow as 'Rosie', a sweet young woman with a heart of gold and extremely overweight. To Hal, she is Gwyneth Paltrow. To everyone else, she is Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit of nearly 300 pounds. The gags start here. Rosie sits on a chair, it breaks. Rosie sits in a booth, it collapses. Fortunately, this is not what keeps the film rolling. It is Jack Black's performance as Hal that I found to be the most riveting.Without turning the audience into a pack of dogs who find his attitude revolting, he manages to win you over with his 'charming' mannerisms while he courts Rosie and you will find yourself, like Rosie, seeing Hal as someone who is actually, very attractive. I found the film to be somewhat, very romantic up until the point Jason Alexander tries to convince Hal that he has been hypnotized into seeing something that shouldn't exist. From this point on, the film travels in a downward spiral as the story unfolds and you just know that something heart breaking will destroy the sweet and steady flow that this movie has been traveling in.The biggest flaws in this film is trying to make usage out of all the 'fat jokes' and trying to teach the audience appropriateness in when you should and shouldn't be laughing. For example - Rosie throws a pair of her underpants to Hal and as he holds them up, they're big enough to use as a table cloth. The audience laughs. In another scene, Hal cracks a joke concerning children in a burn unit at a hospital. He sees them as normal beautiful children - we do not. This is not a time to laugh.It is hard turning a comedy into a 'teaching lesson' on human nature and tolerance without confusing the audience on deciding when and where it is right to make jokes. It is hard to say whether this film is more successful as a comedy or a romantic date movie. I was really impressed by Jack Black's performance. I had only seen him in small supporting roles in HIGH FIDELITY and B-Grade trash like I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SAVING SILVERMAN, roles that weren't big enough for me to give an opinion on his acting credibilities. He out-shines Gwyneth here, a previous Oscar winner for her work in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and even I thought she was better in this film than that.I would hate to say that Gwyneth should receive kudos for donning a 'fat suit' and portraying someone who is extremely obese. If she should receive praise, then a message will be sent that there really IS something wrong with those people out there that she is portraying in 'SHALLOW HAL'. No, Gwyneth does receive kudos - for convincingly portraying someone with a lot of complexes and little self-esteem and making the audience feel for her, not out of pity, but with understanding that we all have in-securities that we are afraid of.I give this film 7 out of 10.

They turn out to be fat, disgusting, and weird.He then meets Rosemary (Gywneth Paltrow in her most degrading role yet). The 300-pound Rosemary. Of course, he sees Gywneth Paltrow but everyone else sees a sight worse than Roseanne Barr. He quickly falls in love with Rosemary who has a good heart and a great sense of humor. Mauricio just thinks Hal is in a slump when he first sees Rosemary.Mauricio then tries to track down this Tony Robbins guy to ask him what the heck happened. He convinces Robbins to tell him the secret code to change him back. Now, the thing is will Hal choose Rosemary when he finds out she's a 300-pound woman? Hmm...SHALLOW HAL is funny. Yes, I will admit. I laughed a lot. This is a stupid, slacking movie which I am recommending because I laughed, enjoyed myslef, and I didn't feel bad for laughing. Many people say this movie is mean towards overweight people, I have to disagree. Once you see the movie you will understand. I don't want to give anything away.Gywneth Paltrow has a degrading role, yes, but it appears like she had fun. She gets to do physical comedy, which is new to her and she just gets to let loose. Jack Black, on the other hand, is pretty much the same guy he plays in every other movie a friggin' hilarious person. The opening scenes are of him dancing and I couldn't contain myself.SHALLOW HAL may have some plot problems that need tinkering and the stupidity level needs to be brought down, but all in all I have to say that the movie wasn't all that bad.

It was an OK show, but not great. There were funny moments in the film, but the acting and plot were uneven throughout. I thought Jack Black wasn't as funny as Jason Alexander, whose depth of experience at being funny on Seinfeld really shined through. Alexander is a superb comedian, a real genius at his craft.I mentioned this film to a girl, and she, being overweight, was greatly offended by Shallow Hal. I could see her point, because it trivializes a sensitive issue, for people who have a weight problem. But given that both Hal and his sidekick are portrayed as the biggest idiots in the film, it took some of the sting away from the problem of obesity. And that's funny.

Hal begins approaching women who, to him, are now beautiful but whom his best friend finds overwhelmingly unattractive. He ultimately falls in love with a woman, portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, who is morbidly obese but whom he sees as being thin and beautiful.  This leads to some rather confusing situations.  One of the most entertaining parts of the movie is watching Gwyneth Paltrow act like she believes she is physically unattractive.  She is very convincing and touching as a woman who believes that no man could ever be interested in her. Another of the best parts concerns Hal's visits to a children's ward of a local hospital.  On his first visit he is under the sway of the spell which causes him to see people only for what they are like inside.  He is utterly confused as to why these children are in a hospital.  They appear perfectly healthy to him.  Later, after the spell has been broken, he visits the hospital again and learns why the children are there.

I find this a bit odd, considering that every single woman I know refuses to see it.  At first one would say, understandable, look at the commercials. The way they make it look, his standard of beauty is thin pretty blondes, hence, this is what he sees when he sees when he sees inner beauty.  And we won't even get into the barrage of fat jokes.  Commercials can make movies look like a lot of things, I mean come on, if you're taking the best 30 seconds out of a two hour movie, which of those are you going to use? There are a lot of things in the movie the commercials leave out, positive things, which I am going to lay on the table at the risk of spoiling the movie.  If you actually want to see the movie, and haven't yet, don't read further.  If the commercials offend you, however, PLEASE read further.Still with me?  Good.The movie begins when Hal is 8 years old, sitting in a hospital lobby. His father, a  respected reverend, is on his deathbed in the next room. Against the better judgement of the doctor, Hal is allowed to speak to his father one last time.  Heavily drugged and delirious, the good reverend tells his son never to settle, to find himself a hot little number. Traumatized, we see later that Hal has taken his father's dying words to heart.  In the next scene, Hal and his friend Mauricio are dancing (very badly) in a club with every gorgeous model type that they see, and are rejected, in some cases quite cleverly, by each one.  We see the two friends later at the bar, discussing Mauricio's current girlfriend, who is absolutely perfect except that her second toe is slightly longer than the first.  Within five minutes we see the real joke in the movie -- it's not the expected deluge of fat jokes (as hinted by the misleading commercials), it's that Hal and Mauricio's standards are that ridiculously high, especially for men who look like they do.  Both men are overweight, neither is especially attractive, Mauricio even has a ridiculously bad hairpiece (or should I say.... nevermind, can't spoil it all).  Many of the films best jokes derive from Hal and Mauricio's incredible superficiality and high standard of beauty rather than Rosemary (who we don't even meet until almost half an hour in) being overweight.Much has been made of the scene where the film takes a turning point, the elevator scene with Tony Robbins.  Tony hypnotizes Hal (in a sense) so that when he looks at a woman, he sees only inner beauty.  Remember this every time Hal looks at a woman in this film.  What we see when we see Gwyneth Paltrow et al. is the world through Hal's eyes.  Hal has been conditioned to see inner beauty, the reason he sees model types is that this is Hal's standard of beauty, not necessarily the world's or what the filmmakers feel it should be.  Hal notices Rosemary initially because of what he sees (or thinks he sees), but he falls in love with the smart, funny, humanitarian person she truly is.  That never changes.  When snapped out of his trance, at first he's appalled, unable to even recognize Rosemary's true self. However, since this is a romantic comedy, he comes to realize (during a hilarious but pretty heartfelt exchange with Mauricio) that he did, in fact, fall in love with the truly beautiful person Rosemary really is, and not just what he saw while in his trance.  As the movie continues towards its close, Hal is less jarred by the reality of it all, and comes to grips with his own high standards and the true meaning of beauty.Throughout the film we see that Hal really is a great guy.  Nice, funny, charming, willing to work hard to succeed.  His overwhelming shallowness, however, is is biggest flaw.  Hal has the capacity to fall in love with inner beauty, he always had.  He'd just been too blinded and too shaken by his father's dying wishes to allow himself to see that in someone.  Over the course of the film he learns a lot about himself, and rejects his own high standards of what's truly beautiful.  Yeah, it sounds like a hokey copout, but in the film, it's carried out on a completely different level.  Hal didn't really need Tony Robbins to help him see and fall in love with inner beauty, all he needed was the confidence in himself, which is the true gift that Tony had given him.  The movie spends more time and energy focusing on Hal's changing attitudes towards women and beauty than it does making fat jokes at Rosemary's expense.  And yes, there are plenty, many of which are in the commercials.  Some people may find this offensive, but perhaps they should take a look at themselves.  There is not a single person in this world who is not superficial in some way, who has not set some sort of standard of looks for themselves.  I'm willing to bet that I myself would be rejected by most of the very same people who have the most to complain about regarding this film, simply because, being overweight myself, I don't fit the Backstreet Boys-Nsync standard of what's considered attractive. I'd be lying if i were to say I wasn't the slightest bit bitter about this. But peoples' attitudes are what they are, all we can do is hope that they, like Hal, find the confidence within themselves to see a person for what they truly are.  It's only a question of how much we choose to let things like this get to us, and how affected we are by the unfair standards of attractiveness society has set.  In the meantime, I myself am not above laughing at an obviously exaggerated caricature, a representation of superficiality pushed to extraordinary limits.  Hal does not represent the average man, nor Rosemary the average woman.  Hopefully those with issues about Shallow Hal will see it, and even laugh at their own faults. Because if Shallow Hal teaches us one thing, it's that truly, nobody is perfect.

But Shallow Hal is easily their most interesting.  That doesn't mean it succeeds in its own goals, or is even a completely enjoyable film; rather, there is a lot of interesting stuff going on in this movie just below this surface, and it's worth watching if for this alone.A personal favorite of mine, Jack Black, plays Hal, a nice guy who is very superficial about his relationship choices, thanks to some terrible advice from his dying father.  A chance encounter with a self-help guru turns Hal's life around; from now on everyone he meets appears according to their inner beauty.  Hence when Hal meets a large woman named Rosemary who happens to be funny and kind and giving, he sees a gorgeous bombshell (played by Gwyneth Paltrow).  Meanwhile, Hal's equally shallow pal Mauricio (Jason Alexander) is confused and angry about the change, and tries to figure out how to reverse it.I think the first thing that will strike audiences is this movie is definitely not as funny as Farrelly classics There's Something About Mary and Kingpin.  But, it's also clear that it's not trying to be.  Almost all the jokes in the movie work well.  There just aren't very many of them.  Shallow Hal plays less like a typical gross-out movie, than a very unusual, high-concept romantic comedy.But all that stuff aside, what interests me is the beauty on the inside message.  First, even though the movie clearly believes this is a good idea, and tries to relate this to the audience, they do so by showing inner beauty through the use of gorgeous super-model types.  How is this any better than just judging people physically?  Do people who are physically unattractive wish to be judged in terms of their looks, but on the inside?  And is something changing in our society that two films with identical messages are being released in the span of six months (The other is Shrek)?This is an interesting movie, and also a sweet and funny one.  Not really for Farrelly brothers fans, more for fans of traditional romantic comedies and also those who are interested in these questions about sexual identity and self-image in society.

It had a few laughs, and a few Oh no! jokes that you could anticipate but not help but laugh at anyway.  A lot of the laughs were guilty pleasures in insensitive fat jokes.  But if you were at all aware of the plot going in, you probably weren't expecting a PC-fest. The plot centers around an insensitive slob by the name of (you guessed it) Hal, played by Joe Black.  Hal's a crude businessmen who is only interested in the aesthetics.  After being turned down by or going through miserable relationships with gorgeous women, Hal find himself trapped in an elevator with a psychic psychiatrist of sorts.  He makes it so that Hal will only see the inner-beauty of women.  The gentle giant ensures Hal he'll be able to get any woman he wants.  Of course, the women he ends up wanting are lonely sea-cows or witch-like women, because, as everyone knows, all ugly women are beautiful on the inside.  You can imagine how things unfold from there, so I won't waste my time or yours by going into it. To cut to the chase, the ending p****d me off.

They tell the audience to see only a person's 'inner beauty', so of course they never show the obese person and just show Gwyneth Paltrow, the obese woman's 'inwardly beautiful alter ego'.  If they *really* wanted to shoot for the whole 'inner beauty' thing, they'd actually put the overweight girl on screen the whole time, and have the audience (and Hal) perceive her inner beauty on their own.** Possible spoilers follow **Well, this could be a spoiler, but that's actually sort of what happens, which I think is a good thing.  The self-help guru's little speech to George Constanza (well, whatever his name is) about how beauty is a social construction of the media isn't anything new, but it's something that really needed to be said in a Hollywood movie and I don't think I've seen anything else that sent the same kind of message, other than Shrek and perhaps The Truth About Cats and Dogs.Sure, there are cliches in this movie, the plot gets a bit predictable at times and there are some inconsistencies in it.  Yes, it is a bit stereotypical that *all* of the physically unattractive women in the movie have immense inner beauty and it's weird how all the shapely women in the movie, well, apparently still have a lot of inner beauty (except for one or two big exceptions).  But for me the movie wasn't a statement about what kinds of people have inner beauty and what kinds don't.  It was a story of one woman who had a lot of inner beauty, but whose physical appearance didn't conform to the cultural standard of beauty, and the guy who fell in love with her.The weird thing was that when I went to this movie, I didn't know it was by the Farrely brothers. (Well, I'm sure the trailer mentioned it, but I forgot.)  The first half of the movie seemed to play off of the cultural stigmas associated with obesity--skinny Gwyneth Paltrow sits on a chair and breaks it because she's actually really fat, ha ha ha.  I guess the entire first half of the movie, I just found myself wondering why they didn't show the 300-pound woman instead of Paltrow, throw out the dumb obesity jokes and make the flick a straight romance.  Besides the fact that such a movie wouldn't sell, I think it would have actually made Shallow Hall a much less interesting film.  The unique thing about this movie is that it tries to transform the average moviegoer's perceptions of beauty along with Hal's the audience is easily wooed by the inwardly and outwardly beautiful woman they see at the beginning of the movie, and by the end, they still admire her even though she's 200 pounds heavier.  (Well, I guess it's not *too* unique, since the same thing basically happened in Shrek, but...)Or maybe I'm just naive.  Coming out of the movie, my cousin told me that if he ever got put under the same kind of spell, that I should definitely say the magic words to break it.

Gwyneth Paltrow is very good as the 300-lb. Rosemary, whom Hal sees as thin and beautiful via a hypnotic suggestion from Tony Robbins. In her thin state, we see how every fat comment wounds her.

Oddly enough, it's the only word I can think of to describe the humor in Shallow Hal.  That just makes me feel all weird inside.Here's the spoiler-free synopsis of the movie...  Hal (Black) and Mauricio (Alexander) are best friends, and both of them are unlucky in love. Mauricio is very, very neurotic.  (Then again, this is they guy who played George in Seinfeld.  Ever hear of that show?).  Crazy neurotic.  He's trying to ditch his latest girlfriend because her &#145;index' toe is longer than her big toe.  Hal aims far, far too high.  `That Britney Spears girl is good, but she's too muscular.'  He's completely fixated on how a woman looks. This doesn't apply to his male friends, however.  Mauricio has a very bad toupee, and another of his friends, Walt (Rene Kirby)... I won't ruin that surprise.  So, Hal has earned a shallow reputation, hence the title of the movie.  Everything changes when his perceptions are altered by self-help guru Tony Robbins (played by Tony Robbins).  Hal is now able to see inner beauty, which leads him to Rosemary (Paltrow).  Rosemary is gorgeous, at least in Hal's eyes.  For the rest of the world, however, it's a different story.How is any of this subtle?  You'll just have to trust me on this.  Don't go into Shallow Hal expecting the sort of gross-out gags that the Farrelly brothers are known for.  There are some cartoonish exaggerations in some scenes, but it's not nearly as over-the-top as their previous films.  The tone of the film is almost philisophical.  That's right &#150; I used the P word in a review of a movie by the guys who wrote and filmed the &#145;hair gel' gag. Shallow Hal seems almost mature.  I'm not entirely sure if that's a good thing or not, but it works in this movie.  &#145;Do looks matter?'  It's a tough question, and even tougher to base a romantic comedy around.  In some ways, no, looks don't matter.  It's what's inside that counts.  On the other hand, if looks didn't matter, I wouldn't be reviewing this movie in the first place.  It's a tough issue, and I'm not about to go into it, or divulge details about one of the best scenes in the movie.As far as the acting goes, Jack Black is only beginning to be recognized by the general public.  He's been big in the undergournd for years, both with his band Tenacious D (which includes Shallow Hal co-star Kyle Gass), and as a bit player in movies like The Jackal, The Cable Guy, Mars Attacks!, and Bob Roberts..  Black should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar (R) for his roleas Barry in High Fidelity.  He's an amazing character actor, but I'm not sure he's meant to be in the lead.  Unless it's in a Tenacious D movie. (If you know The D, you'll understand.)  Gwyneth Paltrow is flat-out adorable in this movie, and does some very good physical acting as well. Most of the time, we see Rosemary through Hal's eyes, yet she's able to act 300 lbs. quite well.  Watch how she sits.  Also watch her eyes.  She has an amazingly expressive face.  Jason Alexander seems to have become typecast as a neurotic little man.  That's ok, however, because he plays the role well.It's a short review because some of the things I'm trying to convey really need to be seen to be understood, and trying to describe some of the scenes will ruin the impact.

Jason Alexander has the funniest bit towards the end, when his character reveals a certain physical trait he has kept secret to Black's character for who knows how long.  To change the subject, I don't think many fat women would be offended by Paltrow's overweight persona, for the fat girl cliches are so over-the-top they are hilarious, and Paltrow plays her character as a smart individual.  I'm sure, though, that people will find other things offensive, most likely the character of Walt (even though he's played as smart and positive).  But hey, this a Farrelly Brothers movie, so you probably will be offended.  Fortunately, you will also be entertained.

A really self-confident man (Anthony Robbins) changes the life of Hal (Jack Black) by jolting his nervous system. After this nervous system jolting Hal is able to comprehend that beautiful thin people were living inside the fat ugly people all along, so basically he got some fat-reducing glasses. Hal becomes unfattified.Hal goes on to dance with tons of pretty thin women trapped inside ugly, bad-haired, wart-friendly, elongated-nosed, fat humans. He then meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) who, being the sexiest inner woman Hal has encountered, is also the fattest. At various points in the film we can see her true form on the reflections of some surfaces and when seeing her through the eyes of humans other than Hal. She's fat, like extremely fat on the outside and at one point you can actually see her cellulite, yuk! So they fall in love and have some fat sex all the while Hal is thinking he's having some super model sex.Hal's friend Mauricio (Jason Greenspan a.k.a. Jason Alexander) is a mutant and unable to score with any senorita, so he decides to ask the really self-confident man to un-unfattify Hal.When Hal becomes un-unfattified he can't understand why there is a robust woman eating his dinner at the restaurant.Mutant friend explains to an un-unfattified Hal why he's now seeing fat monstrous people instead of adorable exquisite humans. He then has a choice to make - either forget about fat Rosemary or accept her with all her chubbiness and have some lard-filled sex with her.At the end they get back together and do as fat people does they go to hide somewhere in Africa hoping they can mix in with the indigenous bony starving population.All in all. A good film to watch on a gym day.

And then when Mauricio breaks Hal's spell, Rosemary is totally unrecognizable! Even to the point where, when Rosemary and Hal pass each other in a hallway, when she says Hi to Hal, Hal says Hello to her as if greeting a stranger, causing her to completely break down and cry, and then call Hal a psycho when Hal calls her cell phone seconds later! Coincidentially, at the same time, Hal's neighbor Jill wanted to hook back up with Hal again. Many times, I tend to imagine myself in Hal's shoes, and seeing the real Rosemary after she calls me a psycho, just simply letting Rosemary go and going ahead and hooking back up with Jill again.Of course, as another commenter says, not all overweight/obese women are nice and kind, and not all skinny and beautiful women are stuck up snobs, either. In fact, some overweight/obese women can be really nasty and rotten to the core, and some skinny and beautiful women can be tremendously flirtatious and hilarious.

My reason for wanting to hate it is because on the outside it appears to be a story about a really shallow guy (who has ZERO right to be shallow) learning a lesson about inner beauty and not being Shallow and yet beginning to end the film still manages to be entirely shallow. Everything is done in overboard enormity for Shallow Hal making everything seem silly and overblown. So after all this being said I couldn't bring myself to hate any of it really. As shallow as Hal and the rest of the movie is, somehow you find yourself smiling, and enjoying watching Jack Black make a fool of himself. I don't believe Shallow Hal is actually trying to truly teach any sort of moral message but rather just being rude and funny and silly while perhaps mocking the moral message? I certainly would never watch Shallow Hal with any youngsters of even impressionable teenagers but for an adult comedy you might just find yourself falling in love with feeble minded, but well meaning Hal.I'm sure the amount of variant opinions of Jack Black could fill a small Island in the Pacific but I am usually a fan of his performances. He is always silly, always slapstick, and always entertaining. He is about as serious as Jack Black gets in Shallow Hal and he pulls off the role well. Gwyneth Paltrow is really terrific as the over-sized Rosemary but she also has an over-sized heart. Paltrow as Rosemary is sugary sweet and her and Black have a funny and sweet relationship although it certainly doesn't paint Rosemary (the heavier one) in a very good light. Jason Alexander plays Black's best friend and as much as I think Alexander is a talented performer his role in this film is simply unlikable. He is incredibly shallow, and barely likable but maybe that is the point I don't know. Still this isn't his best character for sure. A host of really amazing cameo supporting characters make the film even more fun including Joe Viterelli as Rosemary's Dad, Tony Robbins as himself, and Zen Gesner in some of the stronger roles.If you really wonder what Shallow Hal is like all you have to do is look at directors The Farrelly Brothers. Their comedy is at the height of crude humour with sort of a Family Guy like quality to their stories. Shallow Hal is all about fat jokes, mistaken identities and Jack Black looking silly which might not work under all circumstances but somehow Shallow Hal makes it work. I can promise you that someone who is self conscious or sensitive about types of humour will not appreciate Shallow Hal but when all is said and done there is a happy ending and a seemingly romantic ending so it might be enough to appease the critics of the content but until then it is just entertaining and nothing more.

Alexander started with Woody Allen-isms and developed 'George' into a legendary comic figure with his own identity. Naturally, someone's going to try to pick off something meaty and use it for the movies.It's not such a stretch, considering these directors wrote a 'Seinfeld' episode that can be viewed as a microcosm for the whole series -- hint Paltrow plays a 'virgin'; i.e., the series is bookended by (the abortive attempts at) the making of itself...something that easily transposes to the movies. Consider such off the top of the head examples as The Muppet Show and The Player.But this is a failure. Seeing what a poor job Alexander did trying to translate 'George' to this, it makes me think the whole thing was completely misconceived, that the rich 'Seinfeld' ideas just don't work in this medium. Or it least it's beyond these guys.The central premise had enormous potential to be funny. But all we're left with are some thinly spread situation jokes. And they bind up the 'date movie' arc with Black's career arc with the 'best friend' arc...it's OK at best. But they did get the scantily clad women right.

Jack Black is not a great actor, but now and again there are glimpses of actual acting there. In fact, if he tried to play characters very different from his real self (instead of the ones he's done so far, which are obviously just him playing himself), such as bad guys, I think he might have potential as a real actor.But anyway, the concept in this film was not bad at all.

However as a Sociologist, I am now a fan of this movie because of its attempts to approach lesser examined aspects of society. The movie captures the essence of the issolation and societal rejection of the obese and the physically unattractive. Media has always studied up on society, focusing on beautiful people. Rarely is an obese or physically handcapped person the star of a movie, unless of course, they are being made fun of or is trying to be funny.

Perhaps it is a better delusion, a more noble delusion, but a delusion nonetheless. The problem with delusions are you still aren't in touch with all of reality.  Delusions can also easily be taken away, as Hal's is.In the end, though, Hal comes to realize the whole _is_ greater than the some of the parts, and inner appearnace and outer appearance are still just parts.  Rosemary is a person with two main attributes a heroic and compassionate soul and an obese body.  Neither can truly be separated. Both together end up meaning more than either one, because Hal no longer needs some kind of filter to interpret reality.  He accepts reality as it is, spontaneously, without regret or the need to make it in any way different.In short, his awareness of reality is finally totally integrated.  He was mentally unhealthy when he only liked pretty people.  He had made great strides toward being healed as he saw only inner beauty.  But only when he could take reality as an undivided totality, did he finally breakthrough to true mental health.Despite the above sounding like this is some kind of heavily existential film with lots of allusions to gestalt psychology, all this peals forth in a film that is screamingly funny at times, incredibly touching at others.The performances are all magnificent.  Jason Alexander is perfectly hatable as Hal's friend Mauricio, childish and awful, until he comes to some realizations of his own.  Gwyneth Paltrow is also touching as the woman who can't believe Hal loves her, and who endures the heartbreak of heartbreaks when she believes he's become like everyone else.  Even small performances, like Zen Gesner as Rosemary's former boyfriend Ralph, who without actually that much make-up goes from dreamy hunk to scrofulous nerd very convincingly.The true centerpiece performance, however, is Jack Black's as Hal.  An actor with true comic style, yet one capable of great dramatic subtlety, the summing up of his performance is that he has to make us love him by the end of the film.  I think he does this more than just well.  The moment when he realizes the little girl he thought was so adorable the first time he met her is horrifically scarred yet, in the final analysis no less adorable is a stunner.  The look in his eyes when the truth of everything--that only seeing it all works--hits is unforgettable.Lastly, much is said of the fat jokes of this film, that it actually ridicules what it is supposed to be redeeming.  Folks, this is a comedy, and the crux of comedy is making fun of someone.  The final idea is it's not a fat joke in the film's first hour that defines Shallow Hal.  If anything, it's the last fat joke (actually the next to the last), the one where Hal tries to lift Rosemary in his arms, but can't, and she ends up carrying him to his car instead that tells us the destination we were seeking.  Not just us, but every character in the film, including Rosemary, is also laughing. I guess what that says is that if you can't laugh at yourself, what's the use of living? "},{"Title":"Funny! Funny!

After a meeting with  (self-help Guru) Tony Robbins in a stopped elevator; Hal is motivated towards looking at the inner beauty of people rather than attractiveness.  This premise seems to be rehashed from many other films and it probably is but it is executed rather nicely.  The meeting with Tony Robbins calls upon this generation's obsession with self help media, and Tony's help 'works' depending on how you look at it.  What I really enjoyed about the film is how it blended human interest with hilarious comedy.  This is what Stuck on You tried to do but failed miserably.

I liked this message, but at times during the film, I lost sight of the message, and fell completely in love with Gwyneth Paltrow.Now this is at both the right and the wrong thing to do. Hal only sees Rosemary as a slim young woman, who is very, very attractive. But if he saw the real Rosemary, he would run a mile! Yes, Rosemary is funny and witty, and that's what her inner beauty (Paltrow) reminds us of, BUT, if we keep seeing the Paltrow side of Rosemary, the actual 'real' her is just a shadow. It's a complex thing to put down on paper, but you'll understand when you see the film.Jack Black? This is his first major role, and to be honest, he carries it well. Although we know that Hal has a heart of gold, he's still shallow. And to me personally, he does annoy me on times. It's just...sometimes he's too much like Stiffler from the American Pie films, and those Jim Carrey impersonations? Perlease!!!

It was handled very well, and it immediately hit home the overall message.So, if you're out for some fun, it's worth a look. Paltrow is gorgeous to look at as always, and there are some genuinely funny moments and there is one plot revelation that will have you 'rolling over' in laughter!!! 'Here boy!'.

This is partly because it still pokes fun at those people you should be accepting, but mostly because it has a big, big heart.I'm not a soppy person by nature, but I really loved this movie. It shone out like a gem in a sea of recent dross. I liked the fact that despite his flaws, Hal was a decent guy, and his actions in the children's hospital the final time only served to prove it.If there was one thing that did somewhat undermine its ultimate moral, it was the fact that the big gal who is the object o Hal's affections, is in fact played by stick-insect Paltrow in a fat suit. Made in America; a country where gross obesity seems to be a national pass-time, I find it impossible to believe that they couldn't find a suitable actress. Perhaps, despite the upbeat message of acceptance, the Farrely's thought that audiences couldn't stomach a genuine fat person in a the romantic lead? I'd like to think it was more because they didn't want to poke that much fun at a genuinely big girl, but I somehow doubt it...This is a movie to live your life by.

Hal lives a very, very picky love life, thinking he should/could have it all, until one day he encounters a famous love guru who hypnotizes him.Hal believes the hypnosis is going to make him funnier, cooler, and more confident, thus giving him all the girls he wants. Which is exactly what it seems to do at first, as he goes dating some of the hottest hotties in town, which of course everyone (especially himself!) find very strange. But as the story goes on and he meets the perfect, beautiful, smart Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), it becomes more and more obvious to the watcher as well as Hal's buddies that Shallow Hal's gals are...well...not that hot.The Farrely brothers, infamous for movies like Me, Myself and Irene, have created a surprisingly not-over-the-top-gross movie, judging from their standards. The make-up for the over-weights appearing throughout the movie (especially Gwyneth Paltrow's M-U) is very convincing, but is never used in an overly gross way, and the dates' defects are never graphic but merely implied to the watcher. Only at some times is the sensitive subject of overweight used to produce laughs, and luckily, it becomes GOOD jokes, and not overly offensive to real over-weights.Overall it is a potentially sweet movie as soon as it gets past a rather slow beginning, but don't expect an outrageous laugh-fest because this is a rather cuddly movie about getting past being superficial, and finding the true beauty of people. Jack Black is funny in the lead, Gwyneth Paltrow is very beautiful as Hal's vision of the inside Rosemary, and in a supporting role we see Jason Alexander as another superficial guy who turns out to have a slight problem of his own. The acting is, as expected, not worthy of half an Oscar, but the Academy is a bit of a joke, anyway, nowadays, and they make good roles through the movie.What should be nominated for some kind of price, anyway, is the whole story. It is a rather original one, a sweet, everyone-wins story, but not unfunny at all because of this and definitely worth seeing anyway. Shallow Hal is probably not like much else you've seen around comedy, and the Farrelys have scored high despite unfunny stuff like M,M&I. ***/**** "},{"Title":"Nice","Date":"10 January 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" A wonderful film filled whit Jack Blacks crazy comedy and a beautiful storey that made me cry.This is a film worth seeing.

When Hal gets trapped in an elevator with famous Tony Robbins and explains that he has no luck with women, Tony tells him that he shouldn't only look for the womens outer beauty, he should look for the women's inner beauty too. He then hypnotises Hal, into seeing a women's inner beauty and any 'ugly' woman Hal will meet will be pretty to him outside as well as in the inside.

The film looked pretty cruel and besides that I am NOT a fan of the Farrelly brothers--I hated DUMB AND DUMBER as well as KINGPIN, as the jokes seemed all too often geared towards the more ignorant teens in the world. So, when it comes to expectations for the film, it would be very difficult to find someone who was more negatively inclined towards liking the movie. In fact, the only reason I saw the film is that my uncle came for a visit and he wanted to see the film. Not wanting to be a kill-joy, I saw it and said nothing. Surprisingly, after all the initial fat jokes, the film had a lot of depth and good-natured humor and I would heartily recommend it! So why did I like it? Well, despite the crude style of the jokes, the humor was secondary and supported the deeper message. While I don't NEED a message to my humor (after all, I'm a guy that loves MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL), it often helps elevate films to greater depth and meaning. In this case, Hal is a total jerk who only looks at the superficial in women. In a bizarre turn, Tony Robbins apparently has magical powers and changes Hal so he ONLY sees beneath the surface. Now, the inner beauty or ugliness is how he perceives everyone. Now of course, it's a foregone conclusion that he will fall in love with ultra-fat Paltrow, but it's the rest of the people around him that make this an inspired film. A great example was the beautiful woman who is using Hal's disabled rich friend. Everyone saw her as very pretty, but since she was such a shallow and evil person, Hal's impression of her was priceless. However, by far the best example was the touching scene where his original way of seeing people is returned and he realizes that the beautiful children he befriended are in fact burn victims--it is a very heavy scene emotionally and didn't really seem gratuitous or cheap.Another plus for the film was Jason Alexander. I never was a huge fan of good old George Kostanza, but in this film he is great as a sidekick for Hal. His even greater shallowness and insensitivity is great because the character has so much going wrong with him physically that he should be the last person to make these judgments! I don't want to say much more, as it would spoil your impressions, but he was perfect in this role. And, like Hal, you see some profound changes take place during the course of the film.All in all, the film is a wonderful film. Those who hate ME, MYSELF AND IRENE, DUMB AND DUMBER, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, etc. don't give up on this film. The crudeness of these other films is not apparent in SHALLOW HAL and this is actually a film you can let your kids see and still be a responsible parent!!! "},{"Title":"Beautiful People Bad.

They are obsessively hollow, creating irony for irony's sake (as if that is possible). She has a single date with Hal. He falls for her, but she discovers that he is, well just not worth knowing.The comedic device is that Hal is given the ability to see women as they are. Inner beauty and ugliness are what he really sees. Guess what? Our gal Jill is shown to be as lovely inside as outside. The story turns on a joke that viewers are on to she spies Hal romancing a morbidly obese woman and thinks he must be deeper than she thought. But we know differently -- he is shallow as ever. He thinks he is with a knockout, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (who is actually unflatteringly photographed).As predicted, Jill -- sans panties -- aggressively approaches Hal, thinking she has found a good man. He is tempted, but it hasn't occurred to him that she wasn't turned ugly (like the nurse) when he was charmed. So he turns her down to marry the fat gazillionaire. A sad, sad ending.As with all great film art, this one contains some mirroring, here of the veterinarian leitmotif.

Rose's father owns a pet food company , where Hal works in sales. At the beginning, Jack's dancing is canine.

If that's true then Rosemary Shanahan has it in spades.The latest uproarious comedy of bad manners and gross-out hijinks from the Brothers Farrelly spotlights the superficial Hal (you can't spell shallow without hal) - played beautifully by Black, a truly talented comedian on the rise to the high life in Hollywood - a Wayne Newton coifed, tubby stock broker who only cares about scoring with major hotties the likes of what a supermodel looks like.  The reason he's so determined to continue his streak of unknowing crudity is a miscommunication he had as a young boy from his father (McGill) , a minister, on his death bed under the influence of pain-killers, who advises his boy that the only thing important in this world is getting major tail.  Hal takes this token of wisdom as a life-long rule of thumb and the only goal is to continue going after incredibly beautiful women (who all clearly have no interest in the tubby go-getter). After a heartening conversation with his co-workers (Black's Tenacious D bandmate Gass and real-life squeeze and fellow stand-up comedienne Kightlinger) about his ridiculous barometer of the ideal woman Hal finds himself trapped in an elevator with none other than the self-help guru Tony Robbins who convinces Hal through hypnotic suggestion to see the inner beauty instead of the outside appearances with all the women he encounters (and everyone else for that matter). The unknowing Hal begins to engage himself with some homely women much to the horror of his even more skeptical loser buddy Mauricio (Alexander wearing a horrendous hair piece resembling a chocolate covered piece of Astro turf) who measures his latest girlfriend by the freakish deformity of the amazingly gorgeous woman's second toe being slightly longer than the big toe.  Mauricio tries in vein to get Hal to snap out of his haze but is too late when Hal falls for 300 pound Rosemary Shanahan (Paltrow in a nice turnabout is fair play tongue-in-cheek performance), who at first is put off by the seemingly inappropriate cheery Hal's quips about her appearance unbeknownst to his consciousness that Rosemary is indeed larger than life. Seeing the waifish Paltrow instead is the film's running gimmick that works nicely when everyone else sees her true identity as a well-rounded individual.  Paltrow is immersed inside a latex fat suit with some shots incorporating a corpulent body double blend well with the fine make-up job by Tony Gardner. The Farrellys have always balanced the razor's edge in taste (and lack of it) but keep their heart in the right place by making Rosemary a likable sort (she's an ex-Peace Corps member and volunteers for a children's hospital ward) in spite of what others perceive her to be and Hal's love is blindness catches on making him a better person in the long run.  What of course feels like one big fat joke simply avoids the cruelty for the crudity (i.e. no one really taunts Rosemary but instead we are shown some slapstick for her weighty affairs like her running joke of breaking furniture every time she attempt to sit down).  However Rosemary is clearly aware of who she is and doesn't fool herself in the long run. There are some belly laughs particularly in the absurdity of Alexander's Mauricio's Members Only sporting dolt (Were you the last member? Rosemary asks him after their first meeting, one of the film's biggest laughs) who clearly has issues with women and becomes the final butt of the joke by the film's end. Black acquits himself nicely as the under the influence Hal and Paltrow shines as a natural comedienne with her deliveries too.The Farrellys have also often incorporated real-life friends and do so daringly in these politically correct times with the introduction of Rene Kirby, Hal's friendWalt, who truly has spina bifida causing him to get around on all fours which at first is unnerving to see onscreen but like Hal, one gets over it, and sees Walt as a full-rounded character whose success belies his handicap and sustains a normal life as a self-made playboy. There's also an unexpected sweetness the siblings have inserted like jelly in a donut with one sequence particularly well-handled involving the aforementioned children's ward that will get you choked up with tears through the laughter enfolding. Not a true winner like There's Something About Mary  but there truly is something about Rosemary in this full frontal assault comedy.

It had been nearly three years since the film was released, but I had never even heard of it until just before I watched a rented DVD copy of it that summer. Jack Black's starring role in this movie was the reason why I was interested in seeing it, as it had been less than a year since I had gone to see The School of Rock in the theatre, which made me become a big fan of the comedian. I remember my first viewing of Shallow Hal very well, but don't remember finding it very funny at all. Nearly six years later, I've finally seen again, and I thought it was good for a while this time, but it certainly wasn't consistent enough to be 100% satisfying.At the age of nine, Hal Larson sees his father dying in the hospital. Reverend Larson is not himself due to all the painkillers he has taken, and just before he dies, he tells his son to only date women based on their physical appearance. Because of this, Hal grows into a very shallow man, only going after physically attractive women, while his shallow best friend, Mauricio Wilson, does the same, and neither of them has been romantically successful this way. One day, Hal finds himself trapped in an elevator with famous self-help specialist Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him, making him able to see inner beauty! Hal now sees inner beauty as outer beauty, meaning whenever he sees anyone who happens to be good-natured, they look physically beautiful to him, even if they do not look this way to most people. He soon meets a young woman named Rosemary Shanahan, the daughter of his boss, Steve Shanahan. In Hal's eyes, she is good looking and svelte, even though she is actually morbidly obese. The two of them fall in love, but Mauricio really wants the old Hal back, which could lead to trouble!The movie starts with a sequence showing nine year old Hal and his dying father, and this part didn't do much for me, but after that, the story skips forward to Hal as an adult, played by Jack Black. We also have Jason Alexander playing Mauricio. The comedic talents of these two definitely help with the laughs. Early in the film, they say some really funny things, such as Mauricio's reason for breaking up with a certain woman. It's steadily funny for a little while, but eventually loses it. For some reason, I didn't find the relationship between Hal and Rosemary (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) that interesting, at least not around the time it begins. There are also some unfunny obesity gags, such as Rosemary breaking a couple restaurant chairs, and the same character jumping into a swimming pool and sending a kid flying from the water up into a tree. These aren't the only failed attempts to be funny. We also hear Mauricio talking about his turd at one point, and there were definitely a number of other parts where I kept a straight face, though there were more times when I laughed, even if they were sporadic, and the serious scenes don't hurt the film.I watched this 2001 Farrelly Brothers movie for the first time in years after doing the same with Kingpin, an earlier comedy of theirs last month. During my latest viewings of these two films, they both turned out to be a mixed blessing to me. Both of them certainly made me laugh at times, but I could have laughed more. However, even though neither of them is as popular is the brothers' 1998 smash hit, There's Something About Mary, I think they're both funnier than that vastly overrated romantic comedy. Shallow Hal does have its humorous moments as well as some good serious ones, and it also has a message about how physical appearance isn't everything, though the Farrellys' irreverence could offend a lot of people and make the message seem insincere to them. It's certainly not politically correct, but comedy doesn't have to be that in order to make me laugh. I just wish this particular politically incorrect comedy had more laughs.

Taking this to heart, the now grown-up Hal tries his best to entice a beauty, even though he himself is a bit chunky and short. But, when Jack has a chance encounter with motivational guru Anthony Robbins (the great one himself) in a stuck elevator, Robbins casts a mental spell on Jack so that, from here on out, Jack will see only a woman's inner beauty, not her outer self. Soon after, Jack meets the lady of his dreams, Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), a gorgeous blonde, or so he thinks. What he doesn't know is that Rosie is very overweight, as seen by the real world, but he, Jack, can only see her sensational inner beauty. They begin a relationship, though Rosemary is quite baffled by Jack's never-ending compliments on her appearance. Jack's close friend, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), who had joined Jack many times on a quest for a beautiful girlfriend, is appalled by the change in Jack's perception and vows to do something about it. Will he succeed in destroying the budding romance? This is a film that has noble ideas and a great cast but ultimately falls flat in its attempt to go from the shallow to the deep end of the what-is-true-beauty pool. Yes, Hal is a shallow man who needs an attitude adjustment but the film's focus on the obesity of Rosemary ends up being exploitive, not heart-warming. However, Black and Paltrow make the film worthwhile, for Black gives a comically dynamic turn while Paltrow is beyond beautiful and touching as Rosie. Alexander does a nice job, too, and so does the gentleman playing Rosie's Irish father (someday I'll learn his name, he was a stitch as the mafia boss in Bullets over Broadway, too). The costuming is wonderful, especially Paltrow's sensational outfits, and the summertime scenes in Manhattan are very inviting. Therefore, the film's real problems are the script and direction, even though the overall movie is rather pleasant. This is because the subject matters of obesity and, to lesser degree, spina bifida, have been utilized for cheap laughs over real substance. Nevertheless, if you clamor for romantic comedy, day in and day out, do make the time to view this film. It does have a winning story of love to tell, even though it almost gets lost in a sea of exploitation.

Hence, there is no real need to take much of it seriously. However, I found it hard after watching the movie to not feel disappointed and not feel a bit offended. I like the actors in the film, making it watchable, but for most this is not their best. The movie tries to make a moral statement, and fails miserably. The moral I got was pretty women are shallow, superficial, and scheming, so be careful of them; ugly women are intelligent, but deeply insecure. The moral about men is that they are ego maniacs, and if they have money the pretty women will want them. Oh, and it takes hypnotism (or maybe the Farrelly Brothers think this movie) for men to realize this. The irony is I think the moral is to not be shallow (hence the title). However, it is shallow on so many levels.If they hadn't had so many over the top stereotypes, then I guess trying to be moralistic is fine. However, there are a bunch and then flimsy ending which really doesn't deliver much credibility. So the film comes off a bit schizophrenic to me. As someone commented, it seems the Farrelly Brothers felt uncomfortable with the subject, and tried to justify it with some sort of moralistic ending.Other disappointments were that the humor stunk, childish and just a bunch of cheap laughs, but not witty. As someone stated, Jason Alexander is basically recreating George. And shockingly, Anthony Robbins makes a guest appearance. I presume he read the script before hand. Despite being a motivational speaker, I believe he is smart enough, but yet didn't find anything wrong with it? I guess he feels PR and an extra buck will go a long way. The only good things were the cast and Paltrow's acting, but again surprised she would agree to do this movie.

One day he gets hypnotised, so that all he can see is the inner beauty in people, bypassing their looks. He meets a grossly obese, good natured woman, sees her as a classic beauty, and falls in love with her. When he is de-hypnotised he has to come to terms with his feelings and make a choice.The prologue in the hospital should have been funnier - instead, the humour is supposed to come from the discrepancy of a minister becoming obsessed on his death bed with sex and beauty, due to morphine - and this is meant to explain the hero's attitude later in life. Much whackier please.I enjoyed the rest, till about half-way through. The gags and the pace were good, but then it lost its way. I think the rot set in with the ridiculous Irish accent of the girl's father and his misjudged dialogue. You get a perfunctory scene, where the hero succeeds at his job, and the boardroom gives him a round of applause. And the dishonesty of the story begins to nag - how is the hero going to cope with seeing the reality of his lover's body? At this point, there was also confusion about the rules of the hypnosis - the hero also sees the ugliness in the attractive hospital nurse? It was a jarring moment.The film gets back on track for a moment, when the hero sees a little girl in a burns unit, whom he earlier perceived as all cute and cuddly - now she is disfigured, and it strikes him how shallow it is not to react to her as he had before.The third act is really tricky - but all we get is sentimental slush. The dishonesty? His lover is grossly obese from self-indulgence, and downright unattractive. But she herself is given no impetus to change. Get on a diet! The acting was good - apart from the hypnotist guy and the two hawaiians. And is it just me, but were a couple of the ugly girls actually quite attractive?

I'm honestly rather surprised at the number of people who found it offensive--is it really any worse than most other Hollywood films in its myopic view of what makes women attractive? If you're expecting some sort of edgy movie that mocks the beauty industry, you'll be disappointed, but it isn't really overly offensive. The ending, however, is really a pleasant surprise and redeems Hal himself a good deal.I was also pleased by the fact that not all of the unattractive women were overweight; I'd been set up to believe that the entire film focused on the idea that every larger woman is automatically ugly and a source of ridicule.I'm not sure whether Hal was supposedly seeing some sort of physical manifestation of people's personalities or what, but if so, it's pretty absurd to assume that slender model-types are not only the apex of beauty but the only sort of women that can actually be attractive. Ideally, he would have seen some of the women as overweight but sexy--would it have hurt to put a plus-size model in there? No, it is not profound. It could be a better in a number of ways. But it isn't awful or offensive, and if you're bored, Shallow Hal qualifies as a pretty decent way to fill 120 minutes.

The Farrely Brothers have been known for their gross out comedies. Dumb and Dumber, Theres Something About Mary, and Me, Myself and Irene were all entertaining and at times hilarious comedies. Kingpin is actually the only movie of theirs I do not like. However, Shallow Hal is not gross out at all (except for one scene at the end). To some this may mean the Farrelly Brothers are maturing. However, in my opinion it gives Shallow Hal a complete lack of energy. In the last 20 minutes the movie really wore out any welcome it had. The Farrelly Brothers have always worked with diverse actors. They have worked with Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, Ben Stiller, Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Cameron Diaz, Lauren Holly, Renee Zellwegger, Chris Cooper, and Lauren Holly to name a few. Here they are working with Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jason Alexander. There really not as succesful with these actors. Jack Black is always fun to watch but he like the movie is lacking energy. Jack is entertaining to watch but we know he could do better. Gwyneth Paltrow is very much miscast here. This is not her kind of role nor the kind of film she would appear in and her bad performance speaks for it. Jason Alexander can be hilarious(check out Seinfeld if you doubt me) but he is not given alot to work with here. He could be hilarious but the material the Farrellys have provided is weak. The Farrelly Brothers seriously needed to give the film the energy they gave to some of their other films. Shallow Hal really becomes unbearable in the final twenty minutes.

This is a terrible simplification of the idea...Especially annoying was that the only fat people in this movie are beautiful to Hal.  I would agree, they are probably more attractive on the inside, but a lot of overweight people I've known are particularly neurotic, lack ambition, have terrible self-esteem, or have an attitude that looks don't matter at all, and for those reasons I haven't really wanted to get involved with any of them.  But don't get me wrong, it's not like I think your average attractive person is much more together.  But when you start thinking about this, the whole movie falls apart.  The worst of all how come Hal never sees himself as ugly?  He's basically a horrible person.. Oh, and if you think there's more to this movie than the premise, you're wrong.  There isn't.

Although far from liking it as much as Dumb and Dumber (the best Farrelly Bros. movie to date), it was basically a formulaic romantic comedy with a slight twist.But in pondering its message I realized it had none.  I mean, this movie's goal was obviously to say SOMETHING, but it didn't really say it or know that that something was.  Going into the movie WE know the message that beauty is what inside just HAL doesn't.  SO, what are we to learn?? NOTHING.  We know the story and the message way before the movie starts and it never sways from that or shows us anything new and original.  Is it saying this could happen in real life? Or should it? No, because we know that isn't true.  Unless the events unfold just like this, this would never happen in real life.  Oh I see, if you get hypnotized and tricked into falling in love with a fat person then you should go off with them into the sunset.  OK, I'll keep that in mind for the future.Beside there being no clear message, the cheesy, badly acted lines from Tony Robbins are just TERRIBLE. Why do they show this guy as a rich celebrity in the movie? With a limousine and nice suits? Does that make him SHALLOW (an overused word in this movie, which is never clearly defined)??  The few Farrelly-type things with the fat jokes, *SPOILER*-the tail, and the ugly people just don't fit in with the rest of the movie.  Also, we cannot really escape the reality of who is playing this girl--Gwyneth, the queen of shallow (although she does a decent job).  Essentially, we know that none of these actors buy into this and it shows.But these things aren't really apparent while watching this movie because it is as light as cotton candy and about as deep and emotional as an episode of Full House. Jack Black entertains us occasionally with his (seemingly) improvised stuff and his ability to insult in a kind-hearted way.Beyond all this I would have to say my main problem with this movie is the lack of any direction.  There is nothing really interesting in the way this movie was filmed, all of it is just flat and drives the plot (how thin it is).  And I think I'm going to scream if I see another movie that uses time-lapsed sun rising/setting transition shots.  Is this what the directors think of as artistic flair? At least past Farrelly Bros. movies (although none of them great FILMS) had the story and the shock-power (with graphic visuals) to keep us thinking that what we were seeing was fresh.Even though it passes the time fairly well, Shallow Hal is about as shallow a movie can get.

This film is a perfect example, where a grossly overweight woman goes out with a normal man, and we're supposed to believe that he is shallow, and that the woman with the obvious eating disorder is beautiful on the inside.Just as we'd never see a plus sized male model, the whole fat-acceptance movement seems to ignore men, instead focusing on making fat women appealing to thin (attractive) men.As a pure comedy, it's got its moments. But insofar as trying to prove some kind of point, it misses its mark by a long shot - and we've already seen many movies where a man is prepared to make a tremendous sacrifice for love. If the movie had instead been about a grossly overweight man who had a woman fall in love with him, then it may have had some place.

By this it's about as subtle as being hit on the head with a shovel, as opposed to a mallet... The movie's message about inner beauty is shamelessly promoted throughout the movie - whether it's the leading lady, or the sick kids in a hospital, or the members of the local Peace Corp., we are constantly being told how beauty is only skin deep. Ironically the not-beautiful appear as beautiful people which seems to somewhat contradict the message they're trying to promote. I enjoy Jack Black and he does what he needs to perfectly. Paltrow isn't exactly taxing herself here - smile, simper, cry - and we're done. Adequate but not noticeable.Of course a comedy is pointless if it's not funny and Shallow Hal suffers from one being a one joke movie - watching Hal's befuddlement as he tries to comprehend how his beauty gets picked upon, breaks chairs, splashes loudly into pools, etc. The scenes with the kids in hospital aren't so much funny as sickeningly saccharine. The fat joke element begins to wear thin - there's only so many times you can play a particular gag (namely the broken chair and you're so beautiful) before the humour tends to grate a little. The gags also suffer from either having appeared in the trailers, or being more obvious than the Lord of the Rings getting Oscar nominations. There are some genuinely funny moments but from these brothers I expect a bit more and it wasn't delivered.Shallow Hal isn't a *bad* movie.

Jack Black, the talented comic actor who stole High Fidelity, makes a valiant stab here at reconciling Shallow Hal's contradictions, but the more sensitive he becomes to the skin-deep nature of beauty, the more maudlin the film becomes and the more the comic center of the film shifts to his really shallow (not to mention nasty and obnoxious) friend Mauricio. Sad to say, Jason Alexander, who plays Mauricio, does not break his consistent string of unfunny performances in unfunny movies ever since Seinfeld's demise. The waggish reversal mechanism that provides the resolution of Maurice's problems with women (much more disturbed than the essentially good natured Hal's) is too embarrassing to mention and further highlights the uncomfortable collision of farce and sentiment in the film. Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, does an admirable job of making Rosemary, Hal's hefty heartthrob, a credible and likable character, both in her slimmed down version as seen through Hal's mesmerized gaze and in the obese, `real' version she bravely plays through weighty makeup and costuming.In short, Shallow Hal fails as a physical comedy (the four good bits are in the trailer) and is completely disingenuous and unconvincing as a reverse Beauty and the Beast romantic tale. About the only thing a viewer takes away from the film is a reaffirmation of David St. Hubbins' insight in This is Spinal Tap that the line between clever and stupid is indeed a fine one. So is the line between taboo-breaking humor and simple bad taste.

And there's nothing amusing about burned children, as any paedatric practitioner or any parent of a burned child would vehemently testify using that burn ward as a setting was simply tastelessness beyond description. As to the movie's supposed reflection of reality, it flops there as well. In reality, Hal would have been quite willing to concede Rosie a lovely person, but he'd have known he was going to cringe every time he introduced her, and gone on hunting something with skin like cream and a chest fit for a herd of cows.

I'm seriously confused as how such a great actress could be talked into doing such a mess like this. Don't even get me started on Jack Black - he should stay out of lead roles.

Most of the audience I saw it with (it was a packed theater) sat through the entire movie without making a sound.Shallow Hal reminded me a little bit of Dogma in that it had an overall sweet and thoughtful message but for some reason felt compelled to toss in poop jokes.  It was that uneven tone that was the biggest problem with the movie.  The gross out jokes were so far and few between that they seemed tacked on, and the romance was so thin that it wasn't enough to keep the movie going.

And not all of it lies on that a good amount of the jokes were duds, but also in the audience.  When I saw the movie,l it was packed and in the front area were a whole mess load of kids that kept on jabbering with friends and cell phones and such.  It is always hard to hear potentially funny lines when teenie boppers crowd the speaker area.  Anyway, the movie has it's flaws itself though.  It's not a terrbile movie, or even a real bad one either, but just, misfired.  Jack Black, usually hilarious, plays Hal who sees women soley on their looks (hey, don't all men basically do that), and then gets stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins who hypnotizes himm to see a woman's inner beauty long long before physical beauty.  This stays with him as he meets a sweet yet quite obese Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), and falls in love.  To me, the concept the Farrelly's present sounds like a good idea, but I have my problems with it and that come forth in the movie.  Why would all the ugly and fat girls that Hal meets in the movie always seem hot to him?  Why is the line drawn so thinly that all ugly and fat girls have inner beauty and all the good looking ones have no inner beauty?  An interesting premise comes forth here and works and doesn't work because 1) it's hard to figure out in the midst of the ususal Farrelly gags and 2) a topic that is quite debatable is not needed from directors who are famous for bringing forth scenes of such disgust and obcenity they make Marilyn Manson cringe.  Unless the directors want to change directions which could be a mistake also.There are laughs though, I'm not going to put down a film really low where Jason Alexander plays a guy who can be summed up in 2 words- hair-spray.

However, based upon a whole range of other criteria which I consider to be important in a film, I found it hugely flawed. I mean, comedies are meant to be amusing and make you laugh or at least smile, are they not? Not grin your teeth in annoyance or squirm in embarrassment.If you are reading this you do not need me to recap the theme of the movie; as far as I am concerned, this is a forum to express an opinion, not give a review. As far as i can see, the movie makes a number of terrible, sweeping generalisations, so now I will respond with making one - there are a lot of very selfish, self-centred, horrible, superficial and nasty people in the world, especially in America. Jack Black spends the entire movie (does he redeem himself at the end? That is debatable) playing the part of one of the most loathsome, unamusing, inconsiderate, nasty people I have ever seen on film. Maybe his behaviour is 'normal' - if so, the world is in a sorry state, in my opinion. I do not think that he is 'shallow' - well he is, obviously, but that is a bit like criticising Hannibal Lecter for not doing his fair share of the household chores - I think that he is just hugely unpleasant.The premise of the film seems to me to be that relationships - feeling of affection for other people - are all about getting what you can out of others, that you are obliged, out of some sense of right and wrong, to be nice to physically attractive people and shun physically ugly ones. In the 'black or white' world depicted in the movie there seem to be only two types of people - the physically attractive but cruel and the physically unattractive and desperate. I do not agree that the movie infers that all people who are physically attractive are sinners and the 'ugly' are saints, but I thought that it was interesting that the filmmakers made a point of ensuring that Rosemary was not seen properly until right at the end. Presumably they did not want anyone watching the movie to think, Hold on - she might be overweight but she is a human being, as that might ruin the idea that no-one would be interested in her unless they had been hypnotised. Jason Alexander's character's comments about her and the women on the dance floor would have earned him a punch on the nose from me at the very least! Gwyneth Paltrow seemed to me to give the impression that she was not at all comfortable with the message that the film was putting over, and that she wanted it to be over as soon as possible and get paid, but then maybe I was reading more into her performance than was there.This is an unpleasant film about unpleasant people doing unpleasant things - which I suppose in a strange way justifies its existence, as it makes people think about the issues involved in stereotyping, generalisations etc. his reminds me in some way of Ricky Gervais's The Office series, where he plays somebody who is squirmingly awful to watch but makes strangely compulsive viewing. Unfortunately, I do not think that Jack Black is as good an actor as Gervais - although Jason Alexander may be.

The viewer understands the palpable emotional plight of the overweight through her disheartened facial expressions and reactions to Jack Black's character's facetious compliments. In the same vein, I get that we are supposed to feel like everything is evened out by the inclusion of disabled (a man with spina bifida who is 'handi-capable' and walks on all fours) and disfigured (Jason Alexander and his tail) characters. I just didn't feel like it was enough.The onus is not completely on Paltrow to be a believable fat woman. Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers' script leaves a lot to be desired. In spite of Paltrow's emotional ploys, the movie plays out with her munching on gobs of food 24/7, breaking (sturdy; it's well established that her 300 pound frame is what busts it) furniture in two different restaurants (the stunt so nice, they did it twice!); and wearing skimpy beach clothing that is obviously meant to ick out the casual viewer as s/he is confronted by Paltrow's faux-corpulent frame. Likewise, the implication that the two leads have sex is carefully relegated to a scene where Black grins at Paltrow's giant panties, because fat people actually having sex is just gross. In addition, the movie carefully builds up Paltrow in a full-on fat suit for an hour, until there's no more cake for her to shovel into her face and she's left looking miserable and vulnerable. Good thing we got a belly laugh out of her demolishing a booth at a four-star restaurant beforehand.While Paltrow is sympathetic to her character, the script is not; instead of being a feel-good, fat-friendly flick, then, Shallow Hal persists only in justifying mean-spirited stereotypes about the overweight; in this, it's on par with pretty much anything where Eddie Murphy has donned a fat suit (Hollywood, let's just not go there anymore; Julia Roberts in America's Sweethearts was three times too many for the trope to receive any kind of legitimate consideration). That the moral of the ill-told story is espoused by Jack Black, whose lusting after hotties in the film seems hypocritical, at best, hardly helps; nor does the corollary that, while fat people have a heart of gold underneath all those layers of cake rolls, skinny people's souls are shriveled and mean. Nobody wins in this movie. The only good thing about Black's character smugly deciding to do Paltrow's a solid by taking her off the market (and presumably, to the Olive Garden, since, get it, she's fat!) is that it effectively ended the movie, in true Hollywood schmaltz that changes nothing.

He's not funny, insightful, or original, and his screen presence is flatter than the pizzas that he eats five times a day. It's no wonder that his popularity as an actor is so heavily reliant on his mediocre acting skills, bulky figure, or slack-jawed mumbling; you can see this same person sitting in the computer section at any Kinkos. It is this person with whom people are supposed to identify, so it doesn't say much for mumbling, overweight Americans. He always looks like he needs a shower. That's why the premise of this movie is so false; what woman would lower her standards far enough to date him? The movie tries to simultaneously enlighten and ridicule, and the result is curiously flat, as vacant and soulless as George W. Bush's apelike stare. There's some dumb stuff that doesn't quite work, like Jason Alexander's tail (whuh?). Speaking of Alexander, it's difficult to watch him without seeing George Costanza, but here we see a George who isn't even slightly funny and in fact is really creepy. As hilarious as his self-centeredness was in Seinfeld, here it is flat and empty because he doesn't have the checks and balances provided by skilled actors; instead he quarrels with Tony Robbins, who will probably never win an academy award and whose timing is even worse than Black's.If the actors and dialogue were better, the film could have been better, but even then there are problems. Sight gags pop up one after another Rosemary breaking a chair, Rosemary jumping into a pool and causing a huge wave, Rosemary in a lopsided car. Then in the next scene there is some wrenching moment where she's on the phone with Black, realizing that he's no longer interested in her. Just when you feel bad for her, they do some other stupid sight gag. This movie contradicts itself so many times, the sight gags just don't work with the dramatic moments, it's like they took an old Jerry Lewis movie and tried to make it socially conscious.As crappy as this movie is, there are some sweet moments, like the end when they finally get together, or when they sit down and eat together, or visit her parents.

However, the jokes, while bordering on cruel, never delve into the realms of Mickey taking and the Farrelly brothers clearly know how to be funny without being harmful. Shallow Hal does feature many 'funny' moments, but most of them are just funny, and not absolutely hilarious like 99 percent of Dumb and Dumber was. The plot follows Hal (Jack Black), a man that judges women on how they look and not what type of person they are. After a meeting with a self-help guru in a lift, Hal is hypnotised into only seeing inner beauty...One of the film's major negative elements is that it suffers from the same affliction of it's central character - namely, it's shallow. The idea that all ugly women have great personalities and all good-looking girls don't is ludicrous and not really the sort of thing that a film professing inner beauty should profess. I admit that sometimes, maybe even fairly often, this can be true - but it's certainly not always, and Shallow Hal has a rather contained outlook because of that fact. The film benefits immensely from the presence of Jack Black, however. Black has proved himself a worthy talent on many occasions, and he does so again here. His comedy timing and delivery are impeccable and he constantly makes you believe in him, and feel for him, as he has such a likable persona. The Farrelly's aren't the greatest directing talent in the business, but kudos to them for giving Black the lead role here.Shallow Hal certainly isn't a great film, but it's good for a laugh and fans of this sort of comedy will like it. There is also a number of touching moments, not as many as I'm sure the Farrelly's envisioned, but at least some made it &#150; and that's nice. "},{"Title":"Unsure.

I'm not a huge movie person - but, I've recently watched Shallow Hal (Just goes to show how little I'm into movies - 4 years later), and it just didn't strike me as all that good.There was so many things that were questionable. The whole movie seemed to want to make a point about inner beauty - all the while, making fun of outer beauty. Not all big women have such low self esteem. I've seen many big women who were beautiful - with equally hunky men. Just because a woman is big - or not model material, doesn't mean she's going to jump at the chance to go out with just any Tom, Dick, or Harry.And, what was with the whole tail thing? Granted - it was about the only part in the movie that made me laugh - but, what was the point? It just seemed completely out of place - and ultimately stupid. Maybe if it had been introduced earlier in the movie, and thus had a few scenarios to go along with it - it would have suited everything. But, it just didn't fit.I think the only touching part of the movie, in my opinion, was when Hal went back to the hospital, and seen Cadience for who she really was. That part of the movie darn near made me cry (Okay, I'm a sap).Furthermore - if Hal was seeing women based on their inner being - then why was the neighbor still beautiful? She was just as shallow as him, thus, wouldn't she have been hideous - based on inner being? It would have made better sense, if the roles were reversed for some of the other women. The women who wouldn't give them the time of day, earlier in the movie.Anywho, I guess that about sums it up. Just wanted to give my two cents - so there it is.

Jack Black was never given a chance to cut loose, and his attempts at subtle humor failed miserably.  Jason Alexander...ouch.  He should have just quit after 'Seinfeld' ended.

Ignoring the fact that all of the fat jokes could easily be construed as offensive, they were entirely predictable and unfunny.  Even the almost funny moments were spoiled by the ubiquitous trailers. The only bright spot in the whole movie (I won't honor it w/ the title of 'film') was Gwyneth Paltrow.  I'm not a big fan of hers, but she tenderly and effectively portrayed most of the emotions that her character felt throughout a strange and awkward relationship.

I am not offended as most were by the depiction of the overweight and obese (kindly put). I don't get mad at the Farrelly's for their humor. I liked Dumb and Dumber, because it rides the line of taste and gross-out humor. It's more controversial. When you cross the line of disgusting humor, no one thinks the film controversial anymore. They just find it gross. I think when a film's not funny, a film's not funny, and Shallow Hal is not funny... Anyway, the film has a throw-in sentimental ending to make everyone like the film. It also tries to capture what so many people liked about There's Something About Mary, but it fails miserably. Crude, original humor is what it tried to get. You'd expect the audience to be saying Oh, Jason Alexander's spine sticks out and he has a 'tail'. The Farrelly brothers must've thought that's funny. I better laugh. Har... Hardy-har-har.

A girl with half a brain or with one breast? It is the burning answer to this that the film tries to answer. A virtually watchable non-comedy. Not recommended unless you want a chic-film.Despite the interesting role by Jason Alexander George in Seinfield the main problem with this film is that it does not realise what genre it is supposed to be in. Typically of the Farrelly Brothers, one moment it is a sweet romantic comedy, the next it tries to be shocking and the next it wants to be a politically incorrect farce. With too many fat-jokes to be PC and too many sweet bits to be satire I have no idea of what this film is - the Farrelly Brothers certainly have no idea.None of this gels and the film seemed disjointed. It is also very hard to take to the characters, which are either unsympathetic or just dull. Hal is an infuriating person and Jack Black does nothing to try and make you empathise with the character. He is also unable to carry a project like this and make it work. Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be acting in her sleep and the result of this is Rosemary being almost invisible. The only role worthy of the title of 'Comedy' would be that of Jason Alexander despite the fact that no acting takes place on his part in the film as he plays the exact same character as that of George in Seinfield. - The 'tail' is not funny though.If it is to be taken that the film has any real moral standing further shortcomings are evident. Movies like Shallow are stating that it is ok to be obese as long as you are nice. That is wrong. Magazines these days spout off about sizes 14-16 are real women. Real women are those that take pride in themselves, which eat right, and look after themselves.I agree with the fact that inner beauty is more important that outer beauty, however what is so wrong with looking after you and taking an effort to LOOK good as well as BE good. It is these women that should be rewarded, not those in the film.The worst that this film can do, is for it to bring the worst out of you - like it has done with me  - and finding yourself in an argument and sleeping alone tonight. The plot is more or less believable and the acting for this genre not the worst that I have seen.

I am one of Gwyneth's biggest fans and she is pretty good in this film.  I also think that Jack Black does have some charisma.  But the fact is that this film is in the Farrelly Brothers tradition.  That is to say that this film really is not funny.  I thought DUMB AND DUMBER was great, KINGPIN certainly has its moments, and ME MYSELF & IRENE made me laugh a few times.  But latter fare - THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE, and SAT IT ISN'T SO - really did not hit the spot.  Sure, it may be easy to say that I was somewhat offended by the jokes in this particular outing.  Fact is, fat jokes don't necessarily offend me ... they only offend me when I've paid $10 and they are so not funny that even Jason Alexander can't make them work.  Now, the reason that I had a hard time really slamming this ham in the ratings is that I thought that I could see the Farrelly brothers aiming at something here, something that they miss.  I know that this is a message comedy, but when you pick as the butt of your jokes a kind hearted, bruised person who also has a potentially fatal condition that they have almost no control over, well then you have to be better film makers than the Farrellys to make it work.  John Hughes made a similar and far, far better film called PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES about two people who need to see past each others physical conditions to see the real people inside.  Another thing that works against the film is that you can see the cast really struggle to make this thing funny, and that just adds to the pain of sitting in the audience -- you end up begging the cast not to cash the checks they got for this failure.  The film is simply not funny enough nor sweet enough to work (a teaming of Jack, Gwyneth, Jason, and self-help guru Tony Robbins simply deserves better).I suggest that you buy the soundtrack to Shallow Hal (because it's pretty good) and rent PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES instead.

Lying to ourselves that inner beauty overshadows obesity or gross disabilities (as traits that one seeks out in a mate) does not curb the desire to seek out mates of healthy proportions and faculties. From an evolutionary standpoint, this is the right thing to do.We don't make the rules &#150; we follow them blindly. Good-looking people are geared to mate with good-looking people. Get used to it, or move to Arkansas.The hypocritical message of Shallow Hal is bludgeoned into audiences by stereotyping every character that Hal encounters into two molds all ugly and undesirable women are inherently GOOD (volunteers for children's hospitals or minding their sick grandmas) and anyone with 10% body fat HAS to be ugly inside. The clichés are so syrupy-thick that they cancel themselves out! For example, if you're going to compliment ugly women by implying that their true beauty is *internal*, then why does the movie portray Hal's perception of these ugly women as externally stunning? Because it is simply impossible for Beauty to be rendered as ugly, for then it wouldn't be &#150; Beauty.Hal visits a hospital where he perceives all the children as charming jujubes - since when is every sick child a paragon of innocence and purity? Where are all those smart-mouth, precociously-slappable BRATS who populate Disney movies and PG-13 films? Jack Black, as Hal, assumes the mantle of romantic leading man surprisingly effortlessly, *his* body type speaking more persuasively for the positivism of the film's message than any of the extremities of type that the film subjects us to. He is not obese, though not inshape either, yet commands respect and inspires desire in the opposite sex through his overwhelming charisma, talent and financial status. A perfect casting choice. Unfortunately, Gwyneth Paltrow as his leading lady, dilutes the message of acceptance through the paradox of representing Ugliness as Beauty.In a scene where Hal dances with three women who are, in reality, hideous, we realize that though he may see the inner beauty of *other* people, HE is still simply trying to get laid. The whole point of seeing other people's inner beauty is to find that quality within *yourself* that would SEE that beauty.Hal also initially pursues Rosemary because he is aroused by her lithe body, and when he achieves his sexual conquest of her, he still perceives her as svelte &#150; which raises more issues when he is later un-hexed and perceives Rosemary in obese reality, how does he retain his sexual fervor? She did not gradually balloon over years of marriage, or bear a child and retain the weight - her elephantine girth was thrust upon him instantaneously. Hal was never aroused by obesity before &#150; yet everyone lives fatly ever after.But we're not simply talking fat. Fat is okay. Obese is not. Obesity is a medical condition considered unhealthy, overstressing the body's cardiovascular system, bone structure and &#150; through sociological factors &#150; even mental health.Rosemary is morbidly obese through over-eating, meaning that she is battling deep-rooted psychological demons &#150; how then could she be so beautiful inside? This movie sends a message that this UNHEALTHY condition is acceptable, simply because this woman has some kind of sophistic inner beauty. Patently bogus on all fronts! And here's some news for the Fat Chick Brigade Preferring an inshape woman to an obese one does not delineate men as SHALLOW. By god! - these pc-junkies with their insane rationalizing! So the MAN'S at fault if he prefers to bed someone who isn't directly related to Jabba The Hutt? So ONLY fat, ugly and deformed people have feelings worth sharing? (Tom Leykis notes Only fat women have great personalities - *because they have to*!) It's perfectly fine for women to nag, Even if I'm FUGLY, you've still got to accept ME, for who I am!, yet these same women WILL NOT STAND for a man demanding, Even if I don't make six figures, you've still got to accept ME! (Paraphrasing Leykis again Men end up with women they can *afford*.) Ironically, Shallow Hal's grandest insult is aimed at fat people. When two mall-rats insult obese Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit) and Hal defends her, If you add up all the women you've gone with, they still wouldn't equal Rosemary!, he is referring to the slim Rosemary HE sees, the metaphysically beautiful person that inhabits the physically fat beast - but in truth, the REAL GWYNETH PALTROW is unabashedly wallowing in the reality of that statement. And it's got nothing to do with her metaphysical beauty - it's plainly and simply her SMOKIN' BOD. The Farrellys hired Gwyneth Paltrow to sell tickets by LOOKING HOT whilst PRETENDING to be obese. Are we on the lip of outrage yet, fatties?

The screenplay needed to be built around the tensions of the illusion, and its climax and resolution related to the integrity of the make-believe world.Think, why would anyone fall in physical love with a monster woman?  Despite all her inner beauty, that is simply impossible in normal circumstances.  The therapist steps in to make the impossible a reality.

The film's pathetic approach at tryingto make people think that if you're disgusting looking on theoutside, people can't see the 100 pound Gwyneth Paltrow on theinside.

The main character was especially funny in several scenes.  He said funny things.  There was also a few funny situations.  For example (spoilers), Shallow Hal was seeing a beautiful babe at an hotel.  After he came back to normal and finally saw girls like they really were, we see that the hotel babe is some guy dressed like a girl lol. This made me laugh to no end.The problem is that I found this movie very insulting.  I am myself an ugly guy and I was rejected all my life.  People constantly insulted my phisical appearance and it even went to the point where I was phisically assaulted for no reason by some bullies.The message of this movie is that all uglies are losers and that all uglies can't have a sexual life.  I found that rather depressing and insulting. I mean, uglies can have sex with each others and thats their rights; nobody has to insult them for doing so.And also this movie sent me the message that I am a loser because I date fat women.  In the logic of this movie, I should date mean and arrogant slim babes that insult me to become a true winner.  I mean, being ugly is not something that I want to be reminded of.  It is rather something I want to forget.  So this movie fail to provide me escapism.This movie will probably appeal to the beautiful people only.  They will probably laugh throughout the entire movie and think its the comedy of the year.  Those who look bad should not watch this.Bottom line  Shallow Hal will only entertain shallow people "},{"Title":"missed opportunity","Date":"12 February 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Disappointingly tepid comedy about a superficial playboy who's devoted his entire life to dating cover girl women who are physically attractive but emotionally self-absorbed, that is until an unexpected encounter with a renowned self-help guru who hypnotizes him into only seeing women's inner beauty.

There are so many things I like about this film, but there are also some things that I just cannot get over. The titled character (Jack Black, in probably his finest role to date) is a likeable young man with a good job and a better heart, but he is very superficial when it comes to women. He wants a beauty and seems to overlook everything else about the fairer sex. Enter motivational speaker Anthony Robbins (who is a noted writer/speaker in real life). Robbins' puts a wild spell on Black which makes him see everyone's inner-beauty. Thus he sees some people as much more physically beautiful than they really are. Of course Black does not realize the spell has been put on him and immediately falls in love with the 300-pound daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow in a prosthetic body-suit) of his boss (the under-rated Joe Viterelli). A romance blossoms, but friend Jason Alexander (also terribly superficial) thinks that Black is making the mistake of his life. A whole chain of events then occurs which tests Black's views on others and his view on himself as a person. The Farrelly Brothers' had struck gold with insane comedies like Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary, but this film lacks the comedy of those aforementioned productions. Those films had real quiet messages about friendship and relationships, but this film is not as subtle and ends up being a bit of a heavy (no pun intended) morality tale that becomes a somewhat difficult film to sit through during its latter acts. There is a sequence that takes place in a wing of a hospital that deals with children that was admittedly very hard to get through. This up-and-down variety in Shallow Hal hurts the film in the end. The morality tale never shines completely through due to the forced attempts at laughs. I do respect the film for its message that we live in a sometimes messy society that seems to thrive on small-minded superficial people who basically have hearts, minds and souls made out of paper mache. Shallow Hal is difficult to rate, but in the end I found it fair. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

I just don't get them.  'Dumb and Dumber' was at least tolerable and so *not* annoying. That was probably their best film yet, and that's not saying a whole lot.The main problem, which probably only exists in my mind though I don't know why anyone else wouldn't see it from my point of view, is that the casting was all wrong.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Gwyneth Paltrow a 300 pound woman?  Come on, what has happen to this gal's career?  I'm not a big Gwyneth fan, but she at least knows SOME good roles when they do, indeed, roll around. It's bad enough when Paltrow, an actress who earns millions and millions of dollars and can have the pick of probably any script, goes for a film that is as lame as this, but why, oh why would Jack Black be cast in a lead role. Somebody please explain this to me because I am having a difficult time grasping the idea of Black actually getting paid for being such a jerk. He is annoying and one of the worst so-called comedians to come around Hollywood in a while.  Never would I ever pay to see him in anything again. Not even in a film in which he has three lines.I found 'Shallow Hal' to be one of the most boring comedies I've seen in quite some time.  The supposed jokes aimed to make the audience laugh fell flat like an anvil.  I laughed....maybe twice, but I'm being generous. (Jason Alexander's performance evoked the most laughter from me.)  As bad as 'Me, Myself & Irene' was, it at least made me chuckle, despite the fact that it was asinine and seemed as if it had kids working behind the cameras.I know that a lot of people have come down hard on this film mainly because it picked at the overweight population.  Okay, what exactly is the problem? For those who ARE overweight and just find this movie to be so insulting, why don't you go out and actually do something about your weight instead of sitting around typing about it?  For the others who just didn't like it because it targeted obese folks, if you didn't want to see a movie like that, you shouldn't have gone and saw it.  I mean it's not like you didn't know what the movie was going to be about.  Alright, enough of that, let me get back on track.Well, I guess I AM done.  Gwyneth Paltrow shouldn't have signed on, Jack Black is just a jackass and if you want laughs, go rent something else, anything else.  Did the previews look good?  Obviously, or I wouldn't have gone out and coughed up a couple of bucks even though it was a complete waste of time.  The best thing about this film happened in about the last two minutes; it's where the song Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes) plays. Love that song, can't get enough of it.

I mean, I wasn't offended in the traditional sense of the word, but I was angered by this black and white universe that the Farelly's present in this film.You see Peter and Bobby, in our universe, there is a thing called Diversity. It means that all types of people can be all types of things. Not every fat and ugly person is immediately charitable and nice, and not every person who looks physically attractive is a complete bore. That may be the norm in Hollywood, but not in the real world. I've known some real fatties in my day that were some of the most horrible people I've ever met. And I've actually met some very likable woman who also were physically attractive and made friends with guys who like to lift weights that weren't complete meat-heads.This film also says that if you happen to be a little overweight, like someone of Jack Black's build, that you're not allowed to have standards and that only you will be attractive to fat and ugly people. There could be attractive women out there who don't care that much about body type and actually like personality. Granted, the standards reflected by Jack Black's character's scarred psyche were totally and utterly unreasonable, it still doesn't mean that all he deserves is only the overweight and physically unattractive.Now, I really just want to talk in great length about one particular scene. The scene where Mauricio's girlfriend claims to have tickets to a Beatles reunion, where, supposedly, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr reunited with Eric Clapton taking the place of John Lennon.I have 3 VERY LARGE problems with this scene. 1 Eric Clapton does not sound anything like John Lennon in terms of guitar playing or voice. Whoever even thought of proposing that idea and putting into this script obviously knows nothing about The Beatles, or music in general. It was a stupid idea, and the Farelly Brothers were stupid for even thinking of it, let alone sticking it into this horrible film.2. George Harrison died a few weeks after this movie was released. They should've cut that scene out of respect. You'd think that if some famous person that is mentioned in a film, passes away such a short time after the film is released that the filmmakers would've done something to pay their respects to the individual. Like... Cutting the scene altogether! It added nothing to the plot anyway, beside Jason Alexander's character being disturbed by his cute girlfriend's extra long toe, which he had already explained earlier in the film, rendering this scene absolutely pointless. If the Farelly brothers had any sense of respect for the Beatles (which they obviously don't seeing as how this scene is still in the film), they would've done the right thing. But unfortunately, they haven't, and we're still stuck with this horrible scene.3. Even if you are mildly disturbed by a disfigured toe, George Harrison didn't die, and George, Paul, and Ringo decided to do a project with Eric Clapton (although it would be HIGHLY unlikely, almost to the point of blasphemy, that they would've called it The Beatles), you do not, under any circumstances, turn down an invite to an invitation-only, acoustic set of 3 of the Beatles and Eric Clapton! Even if you claim to not be a Clapton fan, it's still 3 of the Beatles! Mauricio was an idiot!As for the actors themselves, Jack Black and Jason Alexander are both very good in their roles, as 2 slimy but likable characters. Gwyneth Palrow was miscast, I think. She's an attractive woman, don't get me wrong there, but I think that Rosemary, as Hal saw her under his hypnotism, should've been played by somebody who looked more attractive than anybody else in the film, which would've at least provided a valid excuse why Hal pursued Rosemary, as opposed to other women, who honestly (under their hypnotic appearances, of course) seemed to me to be more attractive both physically and emotionally. Paltrow just seems more like the Girl Next Door kind of beauty, as opposed to the supermodel archetype, which is what I think the filmmaker's were going for with the character, as she appeared to Hal's hypnosis.Anyway, to sum up, nowhere near as good as any of the Farelly's 90's movies. Represents unrealistic and hurtful stereotypes about certain types of people. A scene which spits in the face of the Beatles. So, watch Kingpin or There's Something About Mary and skip this one.

A LOT to talk about afterwards.  If the sign of a great film is that it provokes heated discussions, then Shallow Hal was probably THE greatest film of 2001.  But of course it isn't, and it isn't.  Probably the reason it's such a good conversation piece is that it's deeply confused, down to its very atoms (one example among many Hal at the start is both insensitive to any virtues except physical beauty, AND wrong about what constitutes physical beauty, but the film treats these two faults as though they were one, possibly because it's just as guilty of the second charge as Hal is) - and it's hard to resist the impulse to dig through the rubble of mixed messages on the film's surface in order to uncover yet more rubble.  Even if I'm wrong about the content, though, what comes across most strongly is the Farrelly brothers' deplorable lack of cinematic and storytelling skill.  Yes, they're in many ways inspired writers, but they need to be placed under the command of a good director in order for their talents not to be wasted, and they're NOT good directors.  (There's Something About Mary was pretty sloppy, too.  I haven't seen anything else they've done.)The film has a decent ending, so we're liable to forget just how bad the rest of it was.  But cast your mind back and recall just how DULL everything was before Hal received his gift from the self-help guru.  The deathbed scene that explained why Hal was so shallow was contrived and tedious (it's not easy to be as tiresome as this in just two minutes), as was the scene in the lift, and neither they nor anything in between them was in the least bit entertaining.AFTER the lift scene, it's no longer boring; it is, instead, excruciating torture.  Hal looks at unattractive women, some plain, some truly hideous, and sees them as beautiful (correction he sees more or less ordinary specimens of the Maxim magazine type, which he mistakenly thinks of as being beautiful; I'll agree that they're not UNattractive), so when Hal chats these women up, there's a constant dissonance between what he thinks is going on (his comments about appearance are obvious allusions to her beauty, the stares he's getting from others are stares of envy), and what everyone else thinks is going on (his comments about appearance are either cruel jokes or misguided attempts at charity, the stares he's getting from others are stares of bewilderment).  It's like watching one of those contrived cross-purposes conversations that only ever happen in movies (usually, for some reason, in restaurants) - except that this one goes on and on for over an hour.  Hal is negotiating rapids with a blindfold on.  Sooner or later he will crash into something, and the longer he doesn't, the more unbearable the tension becomes, and the greater the affront to our common sense.This is not the KIND of tension that can be used to good effect; in fact, it isn't used to any effect, except to make us uncomfortable.  When the crash comes, and there are no longer any cross-purposes left, it's a blessed relief.  That's why the merely competent conclusion seems better than it is.It's interesting, in a kind of a way, that there's just ONE truly gorgeous woman in the entire film (out of, I don't, fifty?) a guest at the party in the very last scene, the one in a blue dress who's standing a bit to the left as Hal and Rosemary get in the car.  She's barely in focus.  I mention this as an example of how bad the Farrelly brothers are at using images to make a point.

We're supposed to sympathize with her, right?  Not cringe at her.  But who knows what the filmmakers were really thinking, because the full-house audience around me was rather vocal in their disgust, and maybe that's funny to some people. Who knows?So the Farrelly brothers had a good idea, but the execution of it is in serious want.

These two factors have balanced each other quite nicely and made it bearable to watch movies like Dumb & Dumber and Something About Mary. Unfortunately it seems that special touch the brothers had must have gotten lost somewhere around Me, Myself & Irene...Messing with stereotypes is a big part of what the Farrelly-brothers do, as well as disarm them with a few laughs. The fact that they were going to take on the stereotype of fat people vs. beautiful people therefore didn't feel so dangerous. But i don't know what the brothers were up to here because i don't understand where this movie is going. Hal (Jack Black) is a man who only loves thin and picture-perfect women who are like models for what is considered beautiful. To help him see the inner beauty of people he is hypnotized to completely disregard looks and of course he immediately falls in love with a hugely fat woman (Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suite). He doesn't see her as a fat woman though but as a beautiful thin woman (Gwyneth Paltrow WITHOUT the fat suit). Now answer me how that disarms the stereotype?! Since obviously hugely fat women are disgusting Hal needed to be hypnotized to ever even look their way... How does that tell you everyone can be beautiful? Since this is a movie i don't have to tell you how it all works out, but saying that it feels far from realistic is not too far fetched.Simply put it feels to me like this movie is rather reinforcing stereotypes and making fun of the very people it intends to help. The whole beautiful on the inside-thing doesn't work one bit and every joke made on fat peoples expense (like drinking a pint of Coca-Cola in ten seconds - Ow, brain-freeze!) just pushes this further and further down the hill.My sincere feeling is that you can joke about anything, absolutely anything! But it has to be done in the right way and this is not it. Insulting people, making fun of them in a way that is degrading more than anything... This is crap and the Farrelly-brothers should do better than this. 2/10.

You can tell that it wasn't made by any heavy/big people.  Some of the events that happened in there I found mildly offensive, but the general public *is* cruel to heavy people, unfortunately.  It does show that people need to look on the inside instead of the outside, though.  Not all big people are insecure or desperate for a mate.  And some men like big women.  For those who do have bad self-esteem or hate themselves, it's due to the kinds of people like those in the movie who make half-reared remarks about heavy people that they don't even know are offensive.

Jack Black plays loner Hal Larson, who gets hypnotized by Tony Robbins so that he only sees inner beauty. Therefore, when he meets 300-pound Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), she appears to him less than half her weight. Other people don't look like their normal selves either, so we may figure that Hal is in for a rude awakening sooner or later.OK, so it's a completely outlandish idea, but the Farrelly brothers know what to do here. Some scenes are really likely to blow your mind, but the movie also does take a good look at superficiality in relationships. Also starring Jason Alexander, Joe Viterelli and Bruce McGill (that's right, D-Day!).

The Farrelly brothers made their name in the field by writing and directing brainless comedy without any form of moral or message...and that's what made them so unique in the 90's, which overall was a decade with very few good comedies! Dumb and Dumberer, Kingpin, There's something about Mary...all these are examples of enjoyable flicks and you don't have to worry about picking up any important life-lessons. Shallow Hal tries to achieve the exact opposite. Instead of attacking the audience with a neverending series of hilarious situations and jokes, the brothers shove the fact that inner-beauty is so much more important down your throat. A morality lesson that is hard to take...especially coming from these guys. Jack Black is one of the greatest comedian of his generation but he more or less looks lost in this production. There are a couple of funny sequences in Shallow Hal, but there never is ONE moment your stomach hurts from laughing and besides, all the good jokes are in the trailer like usual. So, I recommend watching the trailer and you get the big picture. It's better to re-watch Kingpin (my favorite Farrelly picture) or There's something about Mary and spend money on Shallow Hal.

Jack Black seems to be playing against type in this movie, since he, himself, is plump and not the matinee idol actor you would expect to be the leading man of this film, let alone be the interest of Gwyneth Paltrow. When he sees Rose Mary through his trance-like state, he doesn't seem to notice his own imperfections. He wants to be accepted by the same people that upon looking at him, feel repulsion. He indeed is a shallow person and a creep to top that. But he doesn't spend a second to examine his own ugliness and his own shortcomings in the persuit of the beautiful and elusive women that don't even give him the time of the day until Rose Mary comes into the picture. When Mauricio, who's played by Jason Alexander, appears at the beginning of the film, he looks like he's a monkey, or that he's wearing an enormous yamulke on top of his head. He looks hideous and he makes a perfect companion to Shallow Hal Larson. Jason Alexander seems to be still playing George Constanza in the Seinfeld series and frankly, he's so one-dimensional that his character seems to be the real shallow one. Perhaps another actor would have been able to make this part more enjoyable, the same way that the role of Hal would have been better cast with another leading man. Actually, if you see the trailer, you see all the best moments of the film. I want my money back. Shame on the Farrelly brothers to give us this piece of pure, unadulterated garbage.

Even thought he doesn't score well for years with this approach, he has to wait an accidental meeting with a counselor to live the love story of his life (with Gwyneth Paltrow).With the Farellis brothers, you wait for a comedy so the funny side deals with his Gwynelth weights about 150k & he is the only one on earth to see her as she actually is (about 50-60k, I think). Well, the point of this movie is not the exact weight of Gwyneth but tolerance.What defines beauty? Is it the physical appearance as media tends to prove it or the inside feelings? So, as you can see, there is more in the story than a mere comedy. Call it a philosophical romance or whatever, you will be disappointed if you only wait for the bad taste of the Farellis previous movies. Sure, as cats don't make dogs, there are still very funny examples of their once trademark jokes, but their style has evolved. The two actors (Black & Palthrow) are really into it. They don't give BIG performances but very subtle ones.In conclusion, a movie that demonstrates its content Don't trust the appearances!

Unable to get a relationship as a result, he takes his chance to ask advice when he gets stuck in a lift with a relationship expert.  The expert opens Hal's heart and makes him start seeing people as they are inside and not just what's on the surface.  Hal meets the beautiful Rosemary but his friends cannot understand why he has lowered his standards to date a fat woman.The Farrelly brothers make a film that challenges us on our perceptions and our views of what is `normal'? Surely not!  Well, I suppose I should salute them for making a film that challenges the view of what beautiful is and accepting others for who they are and not what they look like, but it just doesn't sit with their jokes - not only in other movies but also in this one; they want to have their cake and eat it.  The plot wants us to laugh at the fat person (or at least the impact a fat person makes when she sits down etc) but then comes around with the message as well.  This mixed film sort of muddles itself and takes away it's comedy because both the film and the audience find it hard to laugh at others at the same time as learning.If you remember the jokes in the other films from these two, you'll remember that most of them are laughing at others who are different in some way - be it a `cripple' in Something About Mary or midgets in Me, Myself and Irene, because they can't really do that as well here the comedy falls flat leaving only the plot and the message.  The message is admirable but the fact that the film doesn't even take it's own advice is a problem.  The plot is reliant on comedy (that isn't there) for the most part and then relies on the message to conclude it (a message that it has already undermined).Black tries hard but isn't allowed to be manic as he can be and is less funny as a result.  Paltrow doesn't do very much apart from look skinny (cause her character's really fat - gettit? Oh how I laughed!).  Alexander is good but it is very hard to watch him without thinking of George since the two characters are so similar - problem being that George is much, much funnier than he is here.Overall this is a poor film.  The trailer shows it getting laughs from the fact that Rosemary is fat but then the film can't do that very well because it's point is that we shouldn't laugh but should accept people as they are - I have never seen a film cancel itself out so well as this film managed to do.
