[{"Title":"offbeat, underplayed drama","Date":"21 December 2002","Score":"77 out of 86 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Roughly one part crime drama to two parts offbeat love story, `Birthday Girl' is a nifty little British film that gives Nicole Kidman a chance to strut her stuff as an actress.  Here she gets to play a Russian `mail order bride' (though, of course, in the modern world she is actually ordered off the internet) who's come to England to start a new life with John, a mild-mannered banker unsuccessful in the ways of love.  John is one of those bland, utterly undistinguished `good guys' who everyone seems to like but no one seems to notice.  Even his boss at the bank gives him one of those noncommittal job evaluations (saying what a swell guy he is and what a great way he has with people) used to fob people off when they are not good enough to merit a raise or a more prestigious position in the corporation. Forced to go the unconventional route in finding himself a wife, John hooks up with the lovely but inscrutable Nadia, a Russian woman who, John is appalled to learn, does not understand a word of English.  Then just as John and Nadia seem to be forming a close relationship (literally bonding over bondage), complications arise when two of Nadia's bizarre `friends' from Russia suddenly arrive on the scene.To reveal more of the plot would be unfair to both the viewer and the makers of this film, since much of the movie's intrigue arises from the frequent turnabouts in the plot itself.  Although there is always the threat of violence hammering at the film's edges, writers Tom and Jez Butterworth (the latter serving as the film's director as well), manage to keep the film fairly havoc free while they focus on the developing relationship between the two main characters.   Kidman, who speaks nary a word of English in the first half of the film (and only with a heavy accent thereafter), does a beautiful job conveying both the toughness and the vulnerability inherent in this woman.  Though innately compassionate, Nadia has had to learn how to survive in a brutal world - even if that means having to exploit na√Øve, good-natured shmucks like John.   As John, Ben Chaplin conveys just the right mixture of shyness, befuddlement and ultimate self-assuredness to make us root for the character.  Because of his Everyman characteristics, we want to see John triumph in the end.`Birthday Girl' doesn't try to push the envelope by indulging in elaborate action scenes or patently theatrical heroics.  Its events seem to unravel in a spontaneous, naturalistic manner, which helps the film to remain relatively true to life most of the time.  It tells an unusual story, one filled with wry humor, understated suspense and a compassionate recognition of human frailty.   Well written and well acted, `Birthday Girl' is an unheralded film that deserves to be seen.

However a glitch turns up - Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language. Although calm and emotionless on the outside, John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.What happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor John from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably acted likewise.Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, almost only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Society's machine, the life which members of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings (Welcome to the machine!). I bet that in the end, John was rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all.Thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, I am sure of it.

Instead it was neither one thing nor another. All the performances were good, but somehow it missed the mark. More like a satire of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller. The plot was too silly for a thriller, the characters were caricatures and the uptight bank clerk would have gone to the police immediately they demanded cash. As a comedy, they could have got away with a preposterous plot and the equally preposterous ending, but as a thriller, it simply fell flat.Nicole Kidman can successfully play the sort of girl who could be a real head turner if she didn't dress like trash, combed her hair, got washed, and stopped lighting one cigarette from another. The scenes of her puffing away on a cigarette casually hanging from the side of her mouth were hilarious. She probably substituted flea market perfume for deodorant. The two Russian accomplices were also good, and Ben Chaplin was suitably uptight as the victim. At first I thought he was too handsome to get a mail order bride, but to have made him a geek would have been too predictable. There are many handsome and successful men who just seem to strike out with the ladies.Overall, I would rate this OK if you have absolutely nothing better to do.

Peculiar, darkly comic series of confusions, double crosses, bedroom fetishes (and ants!) written by the team of Tom and Jez Butterworth (Jez also directed, while Steve Butterworth produced). It was obviously a labor of love for the group, and they could not have found better leads than Nicole Kidman and handsome Ben Chaplin, both excellent in their roles. Still, the script disappoints--it's all over the map--and by the third act we've lost something intrinsic in the characters. Chaplin (who amusingly resembles both Joaquin Phoenix and Steve Carrell) is never humiliated on-screen (he's treated badly but always rebounds and looks after himself); still, the man's anger is released in odd ways (too much slapping) and we never understand his attachment to Kidman's Russian vixen. Is this an emotional connection or is it purely physical? Well-made movie has some fine, prickly moments (mostly in the first hour). It loses itself in its circular twists, swallowing its tail in the bargain, however the film is still a decent attempt at something different. ** from **** "},{"Title":"A good wife. A good husband.

Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel. But Birthday Girl is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind.

Sure, it isn't your basic American comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other movies around, a breath of fresh air. Sure, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked. First off, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy role. She just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood. Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effective, but there are times when she carries on long conversations in Russian and if you didn't know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity.

Is it a light thriller? No, thrillers are supposed to be at least moderately exciting. It seems like it's aim is more in the comedy realm, constantly going for jokes that never land, but then it switches to thriller so drastically that it loses whatever pace it had going for it and then it randomly jumps around to a romance a few minutes later.It's all over the place with no footing, since Ben Chaplin is a remarkably flat and uncharismatic lead who was painful to watch. I hate characters that are written like this, the nerdy passive loser who suddenly decides that he's an action hero, but Chaplin takes it to a new level with his complete like of anything compelling. Nicole Kidman gives it her all as a Russian mail-order bride (get it, because it's funny) and despite her recognizable star power she is actually pretty convincing in the role. Vincent Cassel and Mathieu Kassovitz come in as two more Russians (because when you want to cast Russians, you go for Australians and Frenchmen) and while Cassel is relatively decent, Kassovitz just looks like a French guy speaking Russian.But even if the cast was all on fire there would have been nothing to resurrect this dud from it's poor writing and direction.

When he orders a Russian mail order bride over the Internet, she duly self-delivers herself to the airport in the form of Nadia (Nicole Kidman). One of his main requirements in the arrangement was, Someone you can really talk to. I think communication is key. But as John drives her home, he realises that Nadia can't speak English &#x96; or seems not to.Although John at first desperately tries to contact the aptly named 'From Russia with Love' marriage agency to cancel the deal, the language barrier becomes far less important when he discovers that Nadia is sexually adventurous and encourages him to indulge his every fantasy with her.Everything seems to be going perfectly for John until Nadia's Russian cousin, Yuri (Mathieu Kassovitz), and his friend Alexei (Vincent Cassel) turn up and overwhelm his life. Effusively friendly at first, they soon prove disturbingly dangerous, and John realises that all is not as it seems.The plot heads into unpredictable territory and although the ending is pretty crazy it is also satisfying in light of all the revelations that take place along the way.The film has a lightness of touch, but also a dark side. If I could compare it with any other film it might be Jonathan Demme's Something Wild &#x96; the sexually aggressive girl, the nerdy guy, the slowly blossoming relationship and the intrusion of a psychotic and dangerous boyfriend. The basic ingredients work in both movies.Ben Chaplin hits just the right note as the colourless bank clerk who actually has a repressed wild side, he just needs the right person to unlock it and set it loose. His performance is both funny and engaging.Pretty, sexy, and slim almost to the point of fragility, Nicole Kidman's Nadia looks vulnerable, but as we discover as the story unfolds, looks are deceiving. This is a captivating performance; she has little dialogue &#x96; and half of that is in Russian.The amazing Vincent Cassel plays Alexei. No one can play dangerous like this guy. I didn't realise that he made Birthday Girl before Irreversible. His role here was a good warm up, he exudes unpredictability &#x96; look at that martial arts kick he does when he is jogging with John. It is an indication of John's growth of character when he actually takes him on.A lot of reviewers regard this as a flawed work, but I'm not so sure I can see the flaws. I enjoyed it from start to finish &#x96; I couldn't see how it was actually going to end, but it felt about right when it did.

John (Chaplin) is a guy whose life is plain and dull in his honest opinion; so bad in fact that he orders a girl over the internet to come and live with him; this premise is about as exciting as John's life is or was and for the record; doesn't make sense he orders a 'mail bride' yet when she offers him the ring, he declines; there is no set up involving the company so we're sort of lead to believe that it doesn't exist but since it's on the Internet where millions can access it, it seems a little far fetched that Sophia or Nadia (Kidman) or whatever should show up on John's door when there are probably hundreds and hundreds of richer, more closer to home people she could go to.Birthday Girl is a sort of hybrid of 2005's Derailed and Almod√≥var's quirky film from 1990 √Åtame! The idea that a guy and a girl get involved when they shouldn't really be is toyed with in Birthday Girl since she's a mail order bride whereas in √Åtame, Banderas' character had been freed from a psychiatric hospital and in Derailed, the male and the female just hook up on a train &#150; Chaplin in this film even looks a little like Clive Owen. Unfortunately, Birthday Girl falls short of both films which were rather enjoyable in the end because of its lack of confidence. Derailed gets a little nasty once Vincent Cassel (who's also in this) shows up and that propels twists, turns and a good character study of Clive Owen's Charles Schine and what to do but Birthday Girl just seems to lack punch, it lacks violence and it lacks that hard-boiled, noir undertone, revenge feel that I really wish it had.Birthday Girl has problems not only with its content and which way it's going to go but with its characters and their logic as well as the film's overall logic. Things turn a little ugly once Alexei (Cassel) and Yuri (Kassovitz) turn up and yet when John is suspicious, the police don't even seem to enter the equation over whether or not he should consult them likewise; when he is pressured into stealing money it is the fear of them doing something outrageous to Nadia that stops him from alerting the authorities and only because since her arrival, she's been supplying him with his sadomasochistic desires that I can only guess was the reason for getting her because he was on the verge of giving her up what with all the phone calls back to the website. This spawns two things First, why didn't HE instigate the sadomasochism instead of leaving her to find out and secondly, did he really think they would harm their own cousin out of jealousy of his 'perfect life' with 'perfect house' and car? They'd been there a few days and not had any problem &#150; all of a sudden they are sick with envy and are going to kill their own cousin; like that'll do anything and without fooling around, when that scene happened it was so out of the blue that I questioned the authenticity. If they wanted him to steal money, they would've threatened him or perhaps HIS cousins.Like I said; instead of developing into a revenge film, it flags and bothers about with further character development between John and Nadia, who by this time you rather dislike, before giving him lungs of steel in order to chase down a taxi just when he needs to. John, like the film, remains passive; the antagonists disappear for a day or two before popping up again just when they need to (they're stupid enough to hang around) and just when you need a violent, entertaining finale with a strong lead &#150; you get John trying to scare this hardened Russian con artist with a cigarette lighter shaped like a gun, it's pretty laughable. Birthday Girl doesn't have any stand out things about it but just potters along at a pace that is good but nothing great. I didn't feel anything for John except sorrow for him but I was doing that after five minutes. This could've been a great character study about how far one man will go (like Derailed did) to beat the odds but it ended up as a damp, nothing drama about a bunch of people who have nothing better to do.

Despite the total lack of language, the two seem to be getting on well and John is happy with his new life but, on Nadia's birthday, two of her friends arrive totally unannounced and things take a change for the worse.This film is listed as being just about every genre possible to select on this site and this highlights one of the problems with the film &#150; it is uneven and doesn't quite settle into any one thing well enough to succeed at it. The mix of romance and comedy pretty much never works and it does take away from what should have been a more effective dramatic plot. The logic in the story pretty much works; perhaps not in real world terms but on its own. It kept moving well enough to keep me watching even if it didn't do anything particularly well &#150; it engaged me although I think I was quite forgiving of it because I wasn't in that demanding a mood.The cast are better than the material deserves and they are a big part of making it work. Kidman should be applauded for her film roles, certainly they are unusual for such a big star to do as many smaller things as she does. Here she spends most of the film doing an accent but her presence is good regardless and it means we are still interested in her whenever she starts speaking. Chaplin is better because he is grounded in the real world (sort of) and his performance means he more than holds his own opposite the starry leading lady. I generally don't like Cassel but here he was OK and his worked well with Kassovitz to delivered an improved second half where the drama came to the fore. The support cast is strange &#150; not bad but not good either. The presence of Armstrong and Miller is just another example of the uneven tone to the film &#150; the comedians both seem to be trying to inject a small bit of humour by their delivery, but it doesn't work and sticks out a bit like a sore thumb.Overall this has enough going on to keep you watching but it doesn't do anything that well, producing an uneven affair that only gets a bit better in the second half where the focus appears to settle down. It is never illogical to a detrimental point but it is unconvincing at points. File under D for distracting, because it is watchable as long as you don't expect too much from it.

Too often the film makers have turned this around, and it just doesn't work. Now, we get back to old fashioned basics.It doesn't work the other way around because young men are always looking. There is no such thing as a confident young man who has hero quality.A third character shows us the confident young man. This is the guy who was lucky enough to have a criminal mentor in his youth, one lucky enough to see past the lies that elders tell other children to keep them in line of being good losers.Our hero is one such regular guy, who didn't have the loving parent, guardian, or mentor. Such a guy is doomed to mediocrity, to never being elected or promoted, without regal family ties.Our heroine is the bad girl who begins with the bad guy. In fact, the hero finds himself at the mercy of three criminals, and he is in a hopeless predicament.The worst of them is the third character I spoke of, who is a human monster, plain and simple. The fourth character is rather likable, and provides a pretty good balance. It's important to have such a balance in the fourth character.What transpires is a gamut of emotions. The story is second. This is a stylistic romance to the max. Whenever Nicole is on, the imagery is superb. When she is off camera, the imagery flattens. She makes the impression. This is a very well directed piece. It isn't the highest in story telling, but ranks up near the top in artistic romance.

I theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment--IMHO. Thus for instance, Dogville, even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home, or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention, or other pet causes of Kidman's. Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job. I don't how or who was able to restrain her, but apparently it worked. The way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman soft. And consequently, what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable. Of course, the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy, but his transformation is adequately believable. It isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego. Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.Also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human, apart from their criminal mission. Her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to American culture. And while they are his adversaries, they are never really his enemy. In fact, they are his best friends. In effect, they teach him how to compete and they dohat in a thoroughly civilized way.I really marveled at Kidman's ability to physically appear Russian. It had me wondering whether her ancestry was Russian, but none of the photos of her I examined showed any hint of it. Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing. I can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film. Despite my gratuitous digs at Ms. kidman, the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime.

Every character is stereotypical  to the extreme - the bad gangster, the kind gangster with some jokes, the naive clerk, the beautiful woman who is somewhere in between femme fatalle and an innocent girl needing protection. The plot is also a big cliche and very predictable. The Russians smoke, drink and commit crimes - is there any mainstream movie featuring Russian characters in which they don't do the things listed above? Of course, the main characters first like each other, than briefly hate each other but in the end...gasp...they are on the verge of falling in love. Hello, how many movies are there with the same romantic story? A million? But as I said putting the originality problem, Birthday Girl could be a fairly enjoyable movie if not taken seriously. About the acting - Ben Chaplin was annoying. I don't know whether it was deliberate but he had the same facial expression all the time. Making fun of the cold-heated Englishmen? Or just bad acting? You decide. Nicole Kidman as usual delivers, not that her role was very difficult or something. Her Russian accent was quite convincing but her trying to speak Russian was not that well done. Still better than most Hollywood flicks with people speaking Russian. Her character is the most interesting one and she manages to keep viewers in suspense about Nadia's true personality until close to end. Of course, that is, if you are a bit slowly thinking and not drawing from experience with similar movies to guess what the ending would be (very easy to guess, alas). She is not surprisingly the main reason a lot of people (myself included) have watched this movie and I doubt many Kidman fans will be disappointed by her performance.All in all, not the worst way to lose nearly two hours of your life but nothing more -  5/10.

This is the sort of movie where, if you performed an I.Q test before and after, you might actually find you lost a good few digits in the process.

Basically lonely bank clerk John Buckingham (Ben Chaplin) from St Albans, in southern Hertfordshire, England, orders a mail-order bride named Nadia (Nicole Kidman) from Russia on the Internet, she is pretty and friendly, but he unsatisfied when he realises she cannot speak any English. He tries calling the company he ordered her from constantly to send her back, he is uncomfortable and shy, but she is sexually bold, and he slowly forms a bond with her as she gives him sexual pleasure. Later on, trying to learn English words from a Russian to English dictionary he gives her, Nadia reveals it is her birthday, and later that day a man she introduces as her cousin Yuri (Am√©lie's Mathieu Kassovitz) and his friend Alexei (Black Swan's Vincent Cassel) arrive to celebrate the birthday with them. Alexei soon shows he has a temper, after a violent dispute he takes Nadia and holds her hostage, demanding a ransom from John, he does care for her and to get the money is forced to steal from the bank he has worked for ten years. After the ransom is paid, he realises that this was all a big con, Nadia, Yuro and Alexei are in cahoots and criminals, Alexei is actually Nadia's boyfriend, John learns that they have scammed other men the same way in Switzerland and Germany among others. The criminals take John prisoner, stripping him down to his underwear and tying him up to a motel toilet, he does manage to free himself, and he also finds Alexei has left Nadia behind after discovering that she is pregnant. John gets himself dressed and has a scrap with Nadia, but they eventually calm and sit together, it is then that she reveals in fact she could speak English all along, and her name is not Nadia, he plans to take her to the police to turn her in and clear his name for the bank robbery. However John sympathises with Nadia and decides against this, they go the airport where he leaves her for a short time, it is there that Alexei kidnaps her, he wants her to have the baby, but John rescues her, tying Alexei to a chair and also making sure Yuri is out of the way also. In the end Nadia is snuck through the airport security gates, with John using Alexei's passport to pose as him, getting away also with the thousands he stole in his coat pockets, Nadia suggests he should come with her back to Russia, calling it a long date, John eventually agrees, and she reveals her real name is Sophia. Also starring Kate Lynn Evans as Clare, Stephen Mangan as Bank Manager, Alexander Armstrong as Robert Moseley, Sally Phillips as Karen, Jo McInnes as Waitress, Mark Gatiss as Tim the Porter, Steve Pemberton as Duty Sergeant, Reece Shearsmith as Porter and Ben Miller as Concierge. Kidman gives a downbeat and interesting performance as the Russian mail-order bride, Chaplin does okay as the regular Brit pulled into a messed situation, Cassel is a good choice as the moody villain, and it is interesting to see many popular British comedians younger in the supporting cast. It is supposed to make you laugh this film, I maybe tittered in places, but it is much more about the crime aspect than anything, all the conning stuff almost overwhelms, I agree with critics that it suffers from genre identity crisis, but you can excuse it for having a bit of a love story you can follow, not a very funny film, but not a terrible romantic comedy crime drama.

That's a shame because it had potential.A skilled director like Hitchcock or Preston Sturges could start a film as one thing and morph it into another. Psycho and Sullivan's Travels are two examples.This starts off as a light romantic film, goes to a dark place, and comes back to a light note. But it doesn't really work.Ben Chaplin plays John, a lonely bank employee who works long hours. He tries to meet women online but finally gives up and orders a mail order bride. She shows up as Nadia (Nicole Kidman) who doesn't speak any English and who smokes. This is not what he asked for, so he wants her to go back. Though she can't understand him, every time he makes a noise about wanting her to go back, she jumps him and they have sex. It's great sex, so John re-evaluates.One night two Russian friends of Nadia's drop in on them. From there on, it ceases being a romantic film and turns into something more treacherous.I have to agree with others on this board - I don't think the character of John acted in character when he does what he does. I think he would have gone to the police. It's okay in a comedy to have plot holes, it's even okay if the drama is good enough, but in this case, the incongruities were obvious and took you out of the story. And it's fine if people act out of character if we can see a change in them that causes the change. We don't here.The acting is very good, with Nicole Kidman extremely convincing as a beautiful Russian girl, Vincent Cassel and Mathieu Kassovitz do a good job as Nadia's friends.I would like to have seen this overseen or rewritten by John Cusack or someone of that ilk. As it is, it's just serviceable.

I like her look as a brunette. This film seems to have gotten a lot of criticism about it not fitting neatly into any genre. Why should it need to? The movie should do what it does, and then, if applicable, it can be pigeonholed by critics. I agree with a previous comment that this movie would likely not have worked if set in America. Not enough contrast, like there is here, between the boisterous Russians and the supremely uptight English. It must have been a lot of work for Kidman and the French actors to sound convincing in Russian (at least to a non-Russian speaker.) This film is okay. "},{"Title":"Sometimes Amusing","Date":"8 September 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Birthday Girl is twisty, cheap, and romantic; it is never any of those at the same time, which causes a tonal inconsistency. Oddly enough the tone problems never bothered me, what did was knowing that I was watching a film made lacking in class, thought, and prestige. The film is mildly involving, sometimes even exciting, but only once the ball is rolling and the plot begins unfolding.The scenes that precede it's shift from romantic drama to thriller don't engage us and come off flat. The gimmick of Nadia not being able to speak English could've been a portal to a decently romantic film; that hope is squashed with boredom and lack of development. Then suspense drives the film for another good chunk. Even though you know what you're watching is campy and lacking in quality, you actually become interested or at least amused by Birthday Girl. It repeats this exact act, shifting from romantic drama and again to thriller. By that time the film is narrowed down to creating a relationship between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. The relationship doesn't add up to much, even in the final scene, it's a relationship we as an audience don't know why we're supporting because it's barely been realized. We never see them fall in love, we only see them tolerate one another. The acting thankfully doesn't sink as low as the illy-penned screenplay or the lack of direction from Jez Butterworth, it may actually be a redeeming quality of the film. Ben Chaplin identifies his role with with us decently and what Nicole Kidman can do with her eyes is a rare quality in an actress. Birthday Girl has a few nice tricks up its sleeve, but it's nothing to highlight on your resume if you were involved in the making of the film.

The movie gets to entertain with an engaging plot, and well-rounded characters, well interpreted by a good cast. Predictable ending? Maybe, but we expect it. Beware of web love connections? Maybe, i do not refuse these ways to make new acquaintances, although my limited experience with a guy living in a chat taught me that real life is a little different form virtual life, fortunately... and that knowing a person requires something more than a net connection, and the end of the movie seems to support this simple but not so practiced matter of fact.

The film was released in 2001, however I had not come across it until much later.The film is about John; a lonely, pretty well off bank clerk in his early thirties. John makes the decision to send off for a Russian mail order bride; who arrives in the form of Nadia. At first, John wants to return her. However, after she indulges in his kinky sex fantasies, he starts to warm to her. At this time and during Nadia's birthday party, two of Nadia's Russian cousins show up on Johns door step and after two nights sleeping on his floor, demand more than he had bargained for.The film was promoted either as a tense thriller, a romantic crime drama or even as a comedy/thriller . I do not know to which category to label Birthday Girl as. The film wasn't very thrilling or very comical and the romance was not exhibited enough. The script became predictable and unsurprising after the first twenty minutes, the tone of the film became uneven and the ending was left narratively incomplete. Birthday Girl tries too hard to be more than your average romantic comedy/thriller and this is what spoils it.Birthday girl is blessed with its gifted mix of a talented cast. The most outstanding (and best part of the film) coming from the excellently presented Nadia/Sophia played by Nicole Kidman. Nicole Kidman makes her Russian character believable through remarkable good Russian/English dialogue and recognisable Russian body language and characteristics. The different elements she gives makes her warm and likable; even though she is a crook and a swindler, you want her to be happy and even fall in love with John as the film strives to an end.The two Russian accomplices ; Yuri and Alexei played by the French actors Vincent Cassel and Mattieu Kassovitz are also well done. Both actors do not over play their characters, they bring an atmosphere to the film clearly and conformingly. Lastly, Ben Chaplin looks relaxed, focused and delivers the comical tone with ease.After watching Birthday Girl, it was not what I expected and the appearance of the film was unforeseen. However, I did enjoy it for what it was and the film did make me smile on more than one occasion. Would I have enjoyed watching Birthday Girl without the superior and very sexy performance by Nicloe Kidman? The answer I think is probable no!

Ms Kidman on the other hand - who rarely inspires me - actually does a pretty decent job in this. Maybe because she does have a much meatier role to get stuck into, with Chaplin reduced to playing a mild-mannered timid bank clerk. I couldn't help noticing how Nicole looks absolutely gorgeous for a woman well into her thirties! As I've seen it twice it's lost it's edge, but I think it will provide some suitable twists for the first-time viewer. It's not earth-shattering stuff but it's well-played, and although there's not a Russian actor in sight the accents seem convincing. It's on a par with other recent successful British movies though I'm not sure what category it falls into - it's not really a comedy, nor a thriller. More an observational drama perhaps. It's nicely shot and there are some stalwarts of British TV providing small but amusing Cameos - Ben Miller, Alexander Armstrong, Sally Phillips.The French 'Russian' duo are fine characters and probably steal the show, with Vincent Cassel every inch the hard-edged, ruthless but charismatic villain. All in all a most enjoyable, gentle-paced and slightly off-beat movie that's worth a look.

Neither the romance comedy nor the crime thriller elements are brought out convincingly in the script. And the ending is rather implausible. (for instance, Kidman and Chaplin literally WALK to the airport? Without seeming to have eaten anything for at least two days?) I guess the most interesting part of the movie is to see how one Austrian actress and two French actors pull off Russian characters. I am not a good judge on the authenticity of their accent since I don't speak or understand a word of Russian. But their way of speaking seems to be pretty natural and believable, and I think this is quite some merit. Kidman is the star that has given as much dynamic as possible to the insipidly written story, and the other actors have all done what they can to instill life into the flatly drawn characters.

It then limps along, with an increasingly implausible plot. Chaplin's actions make no sense so that the only emotion is irritability that anyone can be so stupid. The twists in the plot get sillier and sillier, with a particularly risible scene involving Kidman and Chaplin sleeping out in the woods within walking distance of an international airport. But Kidman just about makes the film watchable. She is a great actress, coping with the plot's daft demands and staying in role, so that you almost believe in her.

Jez Butterworth seems to use the same technique but in a suspension sense.Johns, vulnerability is shown on several occasions when the director uses high angle shots to focus on him.  The first high angle was at  the beginning of the movie when he is driving to the airport on the highway to go and pick up Nadia.  The director also uses high angle when he focuses on Johns house on the first night Nadia was brought to his home.

She is used to making serious and mature movies, but I don't know what happened to her this time. I can't even understand why she chose to do this movie. There is nothing great about it, the plot is mediocre and uninteresting, the acting is good, but only because of Ms Kidman's Russian accent, which was somewhat convincing. Even though I liked the performances in this movie, the movie doesn't make viewers bear the whole story since it begins with a sappy story and ends up with a very corny ending. The happy and ridiculous final shot it had, can bother anybody who likes dramatic or serious movies. That's why it bothered me enormously.Overall, the movie is not interesting, it really doesn't have much going for it and there is nothing that can save this story, but Nicole's performance, although I never thought she'd have the nerve to do something like this. What a disappointment!

I guess some people like their comedies, dramas and romances all separate in nice single-movie, digestible, easy to understand forms.  This is the very rare film that manages to do all three at once and do them well.  It veers from serious to black comedy to edgy sensuality sometimes all in the same scene, and has a off-kilter energy that I found really refreshing.  If you're open-minded, can stay with the story, and enjoy really good tongue-in-cheek acting you'll enjoy this one.  I thought the story was terrific and the acting especially by Nicole Kidman was first-rate.  I also want to say it was nothing like Bandits, which was indeed a clumsy series of awkward scenes and bad dialogue.  Birthday Girl most definitely keeps it all together - and also provides that rare thrill in movies - you're never quite sure what's going to happen next.  It's a shame Miramax mostly neglected this film and when they did promote it they seemed at a loss how to pitch it - you ended up having no idea it was actually supposed to be mostly funny.  Ignore the naysayers - you're in for a great time.

Her purchaser is a lonely British bachelor who is a trusted bank employee. He is so trusted that he has keys to the bank safe, a detail which is important to the story.Kidman plays this role extremely well. We can really believe that she is russian. She mimmicks the speech.

Well she turns out to be quite giften in the language of love.Then comes her birthday and a truely shocking surprise as her cousin and his friend come to stay for a while. Well then all kinds of hell breaks loose as we find she is not who she says she is.This movie does have plenty of plot twists to keep us guessing. We pity the poor British guy who was suckered into this little game while at the same time wanting to slap him for being so naive.There are also a few laughs to make the movie easy to watch and a few interesting shots of Kidman (including one really interesting shot of her bare backside).I give the film a thumbs up.

However, it did have it's share of predictable, as well as, totally surprising moments.  BTW, doesn't it seem as though Nicole Kidman doesn't age?  I was certain this movie was filmed as an earlier project of her's, then released only now in the U.S.  I was mistaken, of course, but she still has a youthful appearance; took me back to her part in 'Dead Calm'.  Whatever she does, she should bottle it and sell it to my wife...  Just kidding.  (And I wonder why I'm still single).For it's lack of action; I found myself fully absorbed into this film.  I even found myself wondering if N.K. was really from Russia -- her performance was impeckable.  Ben Chaplin was made for this role, as well, and the duo made for some real chemistry (is it just me or does that Chaplin guy make movies with only really fine women).What worked  Nicole's performance and beauty and convincing Russia accent.  Ben Chaplin's, as well, with the innocent and gullable demeanor.  The other two characters; later in the film, did well.  However, they weren't as frightening as I thougt they should be; I ended up finding them funny to watch -- hell, it was a comedy, after all.  I just though I should be hating them more.  The direction and filming was just right; not sloppy, nor too grandiose.What didn't work  There were a few incidents in the movie that I saw coming right from the beginning of the movie; though, it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film.  For the most part, I hate predictability, but I could let it slide in this movie since I thought it was just so well done and fun to watch.I gave it 8/10 - for a few of the moments that you see coming from a mile away -- Nicole Kidman more than makes up for that, however.thank you "},{"Title":"No Parties Here","Date":"25 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Pretty much a lame duck of a movie.

I can tell you one thing for certain-The Butterworth Brothers did not have final cut.The music used in the film was awful. I could feel some sort of editor slicing and compressing scenes to their bare minimums. The overall cheesiness of the film came just as much as whatever Miramax producer got their hands on the film. I think we would have seen a very different film if the Jez Butterworth actually got the chance to finish the film that he and his brother had started, perhaps more of a Coen Brothers Fargo/Something Wild type of film. Thanks to the cheesiness, we have what is a total chick flick.However, I am not saying that the film would have been competent without the meddling. I don't really think much original thought went into the making of this film. This is basically a high concept picture, meaning that its easy to put the premise into a one sentence summary A man orders a Mail Order Bridge, only to find out she wasn't the woman she pretended to be. This isn't a very interesting concept, and the Butterworths are not talented or experienced enough to sustain this idea into an entire motion picture. The final version that we have in screen is definitely a failure, an anti-noir that ends up being more and more preposterous and unbelievable at every turn. I felt so uninterested with what in the story came next because I just couldn't believe any of it. I really don't think any of the larger issues which kept the film from being a success would have played out beautifully if the Butterworths had their way in the film's completion.That isn't to say that the film was entirely without bright spots. Nicole Kidman, obviously, is perfectly cast in the lead role of Nadia. With perfect to almost-perfect Russian dialects, she makes the turns at every corner as easy as her part in the film will allow. Playing the game of Keep your eyes on Nicole Kidman will probably be the only reason to rent this film once it comes out on video. Also good is Mathieu Kassovitz, who gives an inferior performance to Kidman, but nonetheless creates a confident, always believable character that creates a bizarre awkwardness and typical Russian scariness. Vincent Cassel, on the other hand, becomes desperately unbelievable, and any conflict he has with Kidman seems forced, rushed, and strangely incompetent. Vincent Cassel should stick to films where he speaks French and roles where he doesn't play the villain. Ben Chaplin does not belong in this film either, and doesn't pull his part of the weight in getting the film off the ground. He never seemed to know what type of film he was in, which perhaps wouldn't be a negative, per se, but when Nicole Kidman is so confident at every change, he seems to be rather apathetic and uncertain of what emotion he's supposed to display.When the film actually slows down to let Nadia and John actually talk to each other, this is where the film actually has some positive momentum. This is what the Butterworths are good at, creating character development based on dialogue between two people. Its a shame that there is so little of it, as Kidman is forced to speak Russian for the majority of the film, and they seem to continually be separated throughout the rest of the film. I also don't like the way the director decided to stage some of the set-up, as in certain scenes, the actors only acted in a certain way to fool the viewer, who has been provided with subtitles and close proximity camera angles to Nadia while she was supposed to be in private. For instance, Nadia should know that John doesn't speak Russian, but when she speaks to the Russian friends for the first time, they all speak dialogue that is made to mislead who ever is listening, and in this case, it was only the person watching the screen. In my book, this type of tom-foolery gets a thumb down.I find Birthday Girl to be a forced yet unfocused botched job that just happens to have one tremendous performance at the center and offers a few lines of good dialogue. I would not suggest anyone to go out of their way to see this film, but perhaps worth the time to turn on if its on basic cable. My advice to the Butterworth brothers is Stay away from noir, stay away from thrillers. Your strong point is character development and dialogue. Make a nice comedy.Overall ** out of ****  "},{"Title":"Mencken was right--you'll never go broke underestimating the public taste","Date":"23 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Nicole Kidman is an interesting actress, going back to DEAD CALM, but this travesty of a movie is unworthy of her.

Well, she may be, but this movie is not. Kidman does well as a Russian mail order bride with a secret and manages to pull off the accent, but cannot carry the often-dragging story herself. She stars opposite Ben Chapman (Lost Souls), whose character is pretty straight-laced good guy, but still not that easy to like. He's just not the best leading man that could have been cast for the role. The viewer is supposed to side with him, but doesn't do much but make you feel bad for him. It's one of those films where everything bad that can happen to the protagonist does and it becomes painful to watch. Writer/director Jez Butterworth could have spent a little more time cutting out several unnecessary scenes to help the movie along. Even at just over 90 minutes, it feels too long. The drab British humor may not go over that well Stateside in a commercial sense, but may actually fare well in the UK.The plot is quite ridiculous but interesting. What does happen if someone orders a mail order bride and something goes terribly wrong? Without spoiling plot details, the originality stops there it's another con-and-kidnap movie. The plot is original, but many of the scenes feel re-hashed. This one isn't really worth rushing out to the theaters for.

However, this film is difficult to peg, it's comedy and drama, brought together by an unusual set of events.  The premise of a shy Englishman and his mail order bride is interesting as it is one I have never seen before, and examines in a number of ways the implications of such a transaction with humourous and more often upsetting results.  Also, I have to add that although well attempted, the Russian accents of Kidman, Cassel and Kassovitz were not entirely convincing.  In fact, I am curious as to why there were no Russian actors used in this film (although besides the language thing, the casting was good).Overall I think this is a modest and well meaning film, and I enjoyed watching it.  I am curious to see how it does when it is released because it is a little unconventional and quirky for some people.  However, the writing and story are enjoyable, and Ben Chaplin is good as the slightly flawed but endearing and very human romantic lead.

I can only watch what I can get my hands on and not what I really want to. So I have to watch many pointless movies. This movie is one of those. It is not a comedy. It is not romantic. It is just nothing.John is a British citizen working in a bank in England and living in a small suburb. From what is later revealed in the movie, he does not like his job of ten years. Still, he is observed as dutiful, trustworthy, and a normal employee by his boss and co-workers. Besides the job he is stuck at, he is having troubles at relationships. He does not have a wife or girlfriend (he used to have one in the past) and lives alone. Having tried local market and failed, he decides to find love from a far away place. So he enrolls in a website advertising Russian woman and finally orders a Russian bride. Diana, or as later revealed, Sophia shows up at the airport. She is pretty. what else do you expect? Nicole Kidman plays the rule but the problem is that she can not speak a word of English. While confused at first, John falls for her little by little and Sophie is helping the effort. Little he knows is that Sophie is a criminal with two accomplices, one of them Sophie's lover played by Vincent Cassel by the name Alexei, who are planning to rub his bank using him and his newly found affection for Sophie.I did not like Ben Chaplain performance as John. He is trying to portray a shy, lonely man with a very boring life made up of routines. However, he is not convincing at all. This is the first movie I saw from him and did not like him at all. Nicole Kidman is the opposite though. Her performance is as bright as ever. She plays all these different personalities very nicely. Her first attempts to force John to have sex with her and put a ring on his hand to ensure he will keep her and not send her back to Russia are so awkward and artificial and her face beautifully portrays these feelings. Then she pretends to fall in love with John and says the story about binaculars. Again her face is amazing. And finally, when she plays her true self as a woman with no feeling but pity for John and later when she falls in love again (this time truly) for John is nice. She also speaks nice Russian. Well, I do not know Russian! but it is pretty believable to me. Vincent Cassel as some of his other movies is a professional criminal that ends up a total loser. His rule is sort of short and he can speak only Russian so I do not want to say much about him. The film starts nicely however it ends up terribly. Till the point where John and Sophie separate at the airport and Sophie gives John the binaculars the movie is fine but the rest just does not make sense. I did not like the ending. Several moments in the film worth attention to me. After the rubbery when Sophie's cover is blown, she blames John for falling for a Russian bride if you wanted sex, you should have gone to a prostitute! John answers I already did!. Brilliant answer. The second point Sophie raises is also a nice one. I do not remember the exact words but it is sort of like John, you are a guy who hates his job and life and lives with a bunch of sex magazines on the drawer, how do you expect a girl to come from Russia and suddenly fall in love with you? What did you expect?. John can not answer this one. Also I like it when one of the thieves feels bad for John that is tied up in the bathroom of the motel and feels betrayed by Sophie. Probably he also feels to be very stupid. To make him feel better, the thief shows him photos of their other scams and tells him he was the best among all the people they scammed! Boy, hearing that would have been a relief! Indeed that should have made him feel even worse because he had the best manners with these terrible people. Another issue that amazes me is Sophies binacular. Binacular story starts with the fake affection Sophie is showing John at her birthday. She watched John with the binacular from a distance to make sure he is a nice guy before going to him. So, binacular gives perspective. When you are too close to something or involved with it directly (in other words) you may not be able to figure out the truth about that person or event. If you disentangle yourself and watch from a distant then you are much better able to see the truth. Thats the purpose of the binacular. This happens later also when John uses the binacular to watch Sophie in the airport. He used to think Alexei and Sophie had something going, which was partly true, but the way Alexei took Sophie from the airport and forced her to go with them showed the opposite. This was made possible by the binacular. Before, Alexei arrives, Sophie was crying which was obviously for John. So, binacular helped reveal hidden truths in all these cases. At the end, when John passes the security check point at the airport which is the last step before bording the plane he only carries the binacular with him. The device seems to be an effective tool in revealing the true identities and personalities of people in the movie. Interesting topic.After all that is said, I do not recommend this movie to anyone!

This film reminds me of another Brit-film called B-Monkey, and I wondered if they had wanted to cast Asia Argento in this one too, because I think she was born for this role! I was surprised that Nicole Kidman did this role, because I felt it was beneath her. Like she's too good to do this role. I just figured she'd want a bigger-budget deal, so to see her in this low-budget small-time film, I was honestly surprised, yet intrigued. She pulled it off well. (Spoilers!) Her Russian accent was great! It was wild to see her act like she didn't know any English at first, and towards the end, you see that she really could, but was just faking it! You can see the plot coming once she arrives in London. You just KNOW some goons are gonna come out of the wood-work soon and rob the guy - and they do! You feel sorry for the poor lonely bloke and the sad thing is, there's a gal co-worker who actually likes him and asks him what he's doing for the weekend and he blows her off and runs home, to be alone! Instead, he orders a complete STRANGER, a mail-order-bride from Russia! Can you imagine dealing with someone who does NOT speak your language, who is NOT from the same part of the world as you are, who does NOT see things as you do politically or who does not appreciate who you are as a person? Well, he ordered a mail-order bride and she turned out to be a fraud! A damned pretty fraud, but a fraud nonetheless. A decent movie, if not a bit predictable. I give it a 6 out of 10 votes! Mainly because Nicole is so damned HOT in this one. But I can't help but wonder What would this film have been like if Asia Argento had played her part?

But rather than finding romance, John finds himself caught up in a web of deceit and intrigue with no obvious escape.

In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains, but far to be the Russian one.

However, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting comedy (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the money.This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect.

And although most (American) commentators here try to convince us that this movie was only mediocre and a shame for Kidman, I think different.Maybe it has to do with the differences between European and US-American life This movie has lots of twists and turns that you never would expect from an American movie. You can't name any of them without writing a Spoiler here, so all I can say ist that who loves or hates whom and when changes quite a few times in this film. But, of course, Kidman is always lovable - even as the shady character she plays here.And maybe that's the reason the European commentators (like me) love this movie! Why does evrything always have to be in a straight good bad / black white scheme, when there are so many shades of grey that bring fun and love but also sadness and Weltschmerz into our lives. And that's what this movie is all about A great comedy about people you might never really like and never really hate, but for whom you miraculously seem to care as the plot develops.And given the strange mail order bride situation the movie begins with, it was sheer fun to watch the story unwind and see a movie develop in this dreamlike fashion I like so much. Of course, we encounter stereotypes here (uptight Englishmen, russian criminals) but they only serve to give the characters a basis, a starting point from which to develop.If you enjoyed movies like Crna macka, beli macor (Black cat, white cat), Arizona Dream or La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano (The legend of 1900) you'll love this one.But if you prefer hard action with no plot, stay away!This movie dreams its plot and takes us on an awesome journey - if US-American cinema would only dare do dream like that more often.But as we see joint ventures with Europeans seem to help.

At any rate, here is a bummer birthday-- the humor is hidden and the pathos is annoying.Are we to be amused by the Russian goons who visit `cousin' Nicole and Ben Chaplin, her future husband through mail order?  Are we supposed to pity her as a con artist who may lose her life's love after she loses him his job and his innocence?  Do we really care?  I doubt it. Chaplin is almost without pulse, and Kidman is doing a good-ol' Ukrainian tart with too much vigor and not enough nuance. Her gift of a `Hog-tied Bitches' video to the closet porn-loving Chaplin just doesn't seem amusing despite its potential, nor does her being tied-up a couple of times in the film make it sexier or scarier. Perhaps her lack of lines in English, though accurate enough for the plot, makes her character portrayal rely on body signals, and there appears to be only one signal for this babe-yes and now!On the positive side, Angelo Badalamenti's score reminds us of his moody `Mulholland Drive' and Oliver Stapleton's cinematography saves this film as it did `The Shipping News.'One night, Kidman's Nadia gives Chaplin's John impressive service by hand, and the sex is off and running for the rest of the film.

Another oddity about this film is its depiction of suburban England as a place of almost poetic beauty, something those of us who live here don't usually see. The story, about a Briton who gets caught up in a mail-order bride scam, is quite good at capturing the psychology of those involved, although it's a pity, perhaps, that the bride is so dishonest, in that the mixed motives of her husband are matched by unambiguously criminal motives on hers. But it never really catches fire, either as comedy or straight drama, in spite of the convincing characters, and I think the problem is that Ben Chaplin's straight guy is just so straight, and wooden, not so as to be unbelievable in isolation but certainly so as to never really appear to be actually in the drama - maybe emotional types are simply better for stories. It's still watchable, but low-key without being wholly realistic in need of a little more zim.

The story is rather predictable, but despite that, you keep watching to see how the film-makers will have it unfold.The four main actors are all more than competent. OK, so the two Russian guys aren't actually played by Russians. But who cares? If Sean Connery can get away with playing any nationality he likes - with not even a hint of trying to hide his Scottish accent - then these two guys do more than a good job.I can't really see that this would have done very well at the cinema, if it was ever released there? But it's not a bad movie for a rainy afternoon. I watched it without the sub-titles, which was far more entertaining, since you had to rely on the actor's performance to get across what was going on.

Ben Chaplin usually  does very little for me, but he and Kidman were pretty good in the first third of the movie, and when the characters played by Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz (star and director respectively of 'La Haine' and 'The Crimson Rivers') entered the plot, things started to look really interesting. Unfortunately they didn't stay that way, and the movie got progressively duller and more predictable as it went on, all the way to coulda-guessed-it-a-mile-off ending. I've heard whispers about studio interference after this movie was shot, so maybe that explains why it fails to satisfy, I don't know. Anyway, what you have is a disappointing romance/thriller that is only really worth watching for the contributions by Kassovitz and especially Cassel, a charismatic and talented star-in-the-making. This is not the first time he has almost salvaged a so-so movie, see 'Dobermann' also.

But, I also knew that by the trailers that it was going to be somewhat sarcastic and humorous. What I did not know was that it was not going to be a dark, scary thriller like how I was hoping.Ben Chaplin and Nicole Kidman deliver great performances. And I was also surprised to learn that both Nicole Kidman and Vincent Cassel speak Russian. I knew Cassel spoke French also (THE CRIMSON RIVERS, BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF), but not Russian. The plot is good, and the plot twists are even better. I only wished that someone would have died or gotten shot or something. There wasn't enough violence to satisfy my needs. But what we have is a movie that I could only describe and a Romantic Thriller Comedy.PLOT John Buckingham (Ben Chaplin) is a bank-clerk in rural England. He hates his job, has a run-down car, an ant problem in his house, and has entirely no love live. That is until the arrival of his Russian mail-order bride, Nadia (Nicole Kidman). Nadia doesn't speak English, but the two of them soon get along when they discover each other's kinky sexual desires. Then, something else happens. It's Nadia's birthday. Without notice, her two cousins (Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Cassovitz) arrive and turn John's once peaceful life upside-down.Well, there's the plot that Moviefone, the newspapers, and even this website led us to believe this movie was about. No, this film is not the dark and scary suspense thriller you came to see. It is just another film that, I will admit, is quite memorable but just not the film you came to see. BIRTHDAY GIRL 3/5.

So from Russia with love they send Nicole Kidman. Who I must say, spoke quite good Russian and was very convincing as a Russian woman.And the movie starts off calm and doesn't rush anything. The two start to learn each other, the viewer starts to learn about them and then on her birthday it happens. Two russian friends come to meet Nicole and want to celebrate. But then it goes wrong, as well in the movie as the movie itself. Suddenly from calm it goes to very chaotic and from worse to bad and everybody tries to get back to everybody. To me this wasn't the fault of the actors, but the director. He tried to make a big birthdaycake with all the ingredients that would make it good but when he looked at the result it was just flat. He had mixed too much and got nothing.The movie really supported only on the result of the actors and nothing more. The story was weak and could have been done allot better then this.Nicole Kidman almost got a flawless record this year but just at the finish she fell down, although she did a fine work. And Ben Chaplin was also pretty good at his part. If you want a chaotic movie like this with sort off  a similar story watch Something Wild of Jonathan Demme.

Watch Out!Funny as this may sound, this small budget flick did hold up my interest. And I didn't think it's as silly and absurd as many have made it out to be. This flick has some interesting little leads that make the plot work for me.Here we see two guys (let us forget Yuri's other male accomplice, for I actually did - moments after his appearance!) attracted to one girl. One a well-traveled crook living out of suitcases; the other a na√Øve, homely guy; and they certainly treat and see their woman in very different ways. And it's watching these two guys together that help me applause the final end. There are scenes of `domestic' brutality, no doubt, but it's not with glorifying and horrifying episodes of gore and gush.  Sure, there are several sex scenes, but not with the kind of passion-driven acts that many may have expected to see, after Kidman's role in `Eyes Wide Shut.'  That was definitely fine for me&#133; and believable too.  Sofia's character is not meant to be provocatively sexy, or bitchy.  Just a determined schemer, acting out, in every way she can, to accomplish her mission&#133; and I bet, she must be freaking out, each time she has an intimate session with a stranger! And John, an introvert (and a virgin, very likely!) &#150; the sort of guy who probably thinks a woman's place is  solely at home &#150; doesn't even seem comfortable with his female colleague, or other co-workers.  He lives his fancies through magazines, within his neat, little home. Chaplin and Kidman perform well in creating a screen mood that seems to lead nowhere&#133; at least, until the birthday girl decides it's time forcelebration. And there are those subtle visual hints, e.g. the binocular case, uncovered at the beginning, that lends a hand to the story's end. And Sofia's bruises help to keep the story moving.  I  realized she can be a tough jiffy. And the sight of the bruises opens up, on screen, the ruthless and violent nature of Yuri.  And it also contributes to the starting point of the love-triangle-conflict. Yep, it's these subtleties that make the story fun to follow. Again, Kidman has provided her show of enduring talent&#133; hey, this is a gal who was born in Hawaii, spent most of her youth in Australia, acts, sings; and now, in this movie, rumbles away in Russian!  And Cessel fits well into the shoes of his villainous character.Overall, this movie has little chance of creating an Oscar gossip, but it is still worth the price of a matinee. My rating B-.

If I'd been editing it, I'd have lost all the comedy performances from the likes of Stephen Mangan, Sally Phillips and Alexander Armstrong. The incidental elements of comedy in Birthday Girl are well done but the bank scenes are patently false and appear to have been pasted in from another movie. Another problem is La Kidman. You can see the Acting Gears churning in every scene she appears in, until it's revealed that she's not really a mail-order Russian bride. Well, I'd sort of guessed that as soon as she turned up at the airport. La Kidman has now reached a stage in her career where she takes her craft very seriously and the result in Birthday Girl is that her character is transparent. Kidman acts like a Russian woman who is pretending to be a mail-order bride and you can see her doing it. Fortunately La Kidman's uber-Streep performance is counterbalanced by Ben Chaplin, who plays repressed bank clerk John very sympathetically. Vincent Cassel and Mathieu Kassovitz also turn in good performances as Russian con artists and there are a few UK comedy actors who acquit themselves well in minor roles elsewhere in the film.Ignore the forced attempts at comedy and you'll enjoy Birthday Girl.

This was apparently a last minute schedule filler after she backed out of `Panic Room.'Here we have a common situation, a weak director -- no coherent vision. Usually, these make for very interesting experiences when you involve a strong actor. That actor fills in all the space the director cannot see, giving an `invisible' performance. In fact, I use it as a test for whether an actor goes on my list to follow no matter the project.Nichole fails this test, and that's a shame after `Moulin Rouge!' in which she gives a multilevel performance (as the character, as the actor, as the character acting). Plus, the theory of Australian dramatic training is an attractive one, since so many of our multidimensionally capable actresses come from there. And when someone reaches this level of celebrity, it is fun to speculate on how she reinvents sex roles.More the actor's dream is to act characters who are acting, as is the case here. But in this thin film, what Nichole contributes is thin as well. There is no glimmer of a full inhabitation of the role. There is no annotative reflection. There is less life inside than what she shows.Contrast this with a similarly confused film, `Bandits,' that features her colleague, Cate Blanchett. This is a loose collection of episodes that the director doesn't control, and has the additional problem of two muggers as her costars. See how Cate completely understands where the director and other actors are and are not. See how she uses that stage to create a parallel role behind everyone's back but in such a way that we the viewer can see it. See how similar the form of this stolen role is to the explicit form that Nichole uses in `Rouge!' See how Nichole does none of that here.I suspect Nichole is better than this, but needs confidence or something. Let's hope she gets what she needs.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

It doesn't work that way at all, so I don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. There isn't a single Russian bride introduction website that works this way, and I challenge anyone to find one that does. The fact is, you can only order the Russian lady's CONTACT INFO (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there, you correspond and then visit her, and if you want to bring her to your country, you start the immigration process at your INS office, and wait months after that.

First coming to the American screen as a teenager in New Zealand who                               with her best friend brutally murders the other girl's mom (Heavenly Creatures, a true story), she catapulted into                               many different roles. Her accents have run from Midwest Flat (To Die For) to New York suave (Eyes Wide Shut)                               to fantasy and fantastical Paris (Moulin Rouge). Now in Birthday Girl she enunciates rapid fire Russian with such                               apparent command that I found myself whispering da several times while watching the film in Manhattan.

Fortunately for Ben Chaplin, the now bewildered                               clerk, her yes works for sex as well as for conversation.                              Then arrive weekend-but-forget-to-leave Russian visitors who are exasperating initially but in one flash become                               dangerous, even deadly.

There are more humorous scenes in this somewhat unevenly told story but it's hard to lose interest. Chaplin and                               Kidman act well together and their mutual hard slaps across the face are definitely cinema verite.                              The resolution is unrealistic but so what. Nicole Kidman again demonstrates she'll try any kind of role and pull it off.  "}]
