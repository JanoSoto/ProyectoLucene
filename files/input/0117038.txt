However, the amazingly low IMDB score has prompted me to jot down a few thoughts and memories I have regarding this under-appreciated masterpiece.I find it appalling that this film would score so poorly in this arena. It is a wonderful, life affirming story with a positive message. Perhaps this is what we have come to. The comedy is not gross enough, the message too sentimental and the meaning too simple for modern sophisticated audiences. Well, I for one, absolutely loved every minute of it. It is easily Andie MacDowell's best performance. William Hurt is fantastic as the cynic who comes around in the end and the whole supporting cast does a wonderful job. Of course, John Travolta is superb. This is one of my favorite roles Travolta has played and it is simply resplendent. I would have to say this is in my top twenty of comedy-dramas ever. I just happen to love the way the film unapologetically illustrates how wonderful life is. How even the little things that we take for granted, like pie, are fantastic and how we should enjoy every minute like it was our last.For a much more detailed and well written review see the fine work of jhclues who echoes my feelings about the movie so much that I feel it would be redundant of me to restate, probably poorly, all that they have already committed to page.It is also interesting that so many people really hated it. I wonder if they weren't just put off by the less than traditional view of a religious subject.

Travolta gives one of his breeziest and most likable performances as Michael, an archangel whose quiet existence at the home of a lonely innkeeper named Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is disrupted when Pansy reports Michael's presence in her home to a National Enquirer-like newspaper and the editor (Bob Hoskins) sends reporters (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to check it out. Hurt, McDowell, and Pastorelli are quite good as the jaded news staffers who have a hard time accepting they've met an angel but this is Travolta's show and he rules as the pot-bellied, sugar-eating, cookie-smelling, pie-loving, Aretha-loving, bull-chasing Michael, an angel who just isn't what you think you of when you think of angels. And you have to love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance to Chain of Fools. I love this movie more and more every time I watch it and it's mainly because of the completely winning performance from John Travolta.

Michael is a rude, obnoxious, womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes, and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched.Funny, but not greatly so, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever...it is just a good simple, small comedy.

There's really no reason to dislike this film. Michael is a simple, but fairly original, and easily enjoyable romantic comedy. The plot involves a group of reporters/experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the midwest. The angel proves to be less saintly and more worldly than we would expect, and that's what makes it entertaining. His interest in women and the Beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing. The romantic side of this film involves Michael the angel trying to get Andie MacDowell and William Hurt together. The two of them may not have the all-time greatest on-screen chemistry, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. Everyone who has rated this film so low (a 5.4??), come on!

When their editor lays down an ultimatum to them, they bring him a potentially great story &#150; a real life angel. They are accompanied by a supposed angel expert, Dorothy Winters who has really been sent to keep an eye on the reporters for editor Vartan Malt. When they arrive they find the 'angel' to appear to be genuine but to be a lot less, well, angelic than they expected him to be &#150; smoking, drinking and womanising. Michael agrees to go back to Chicago and be in the papers but only if they can travel back by road and make stops along the way. As Michael gets his traveling companions in and out of trouble it begins to seem that he may actually have a bigger aim to achieve than just getting into the papers.In the UK it is not the 'done thing' to cheer, clap or deride films or trailers in a very public way in the same manner as US audiences will do as the norm (my first time in a US cinema was a surprise when the audience applauded), but it is the reason I will always remember this film. When the trailer was shown in the UK, the audience I was with actually jeered and booed it (myself included) because it just looked so damn lame and stupid. So I skipped it in the cinema (as many did) but then caught it on TV a few years later. Although it is far from a perfect film and its mood and tone are poorly matched it is actually nowhere near as bad as it looked. The story is the usual earthbound angel stuff that Hollywood seems to quite like and it meanders along rather aimlessly, turning into a very vague road movie of sorts. The romance is obvious and uninspiring but generally the film is fun when it manages to have it's tongue in its cheek.The problem is that it can't decide if it wants to be sappy and romantic or daffy fun. When it tries to be more of a traditional Hollywood romance it doesn't really work that well and indeed is rather laboured. However when it just gets silly and focuses on a really tongue in cheek Michael then it is much more enjoyable as long as you can buy into the sense of humour that it is selling. These two styles don't really come together and they give the film a rather fragmented feel that takes away from the fun (if silly) aspect that stood a good chance of really working if given a little bit more dominance in the film. Sadly the film falls back too much on sentimentality and it sours the mix because it is manufactured, processed, unengaging and quite forced.For the same reason the performances are mixed. For the most part Travolta is quite funny and just appears to be taking the p*ss and enjoying himself &#150; the way he doesn't seem to take it seriously helped me enjoy the film a lot more. He is silly of course but I found this to be enjoyable in light of the more ponderous 'worthy' roles he has played in the years since his Pulp Fiction comeback. Lumbered with the promise of romance, Hurt is not that good but is nicely cynical for the majority of the movie; MacDowell is painfully lame at times and her character is pretty poor, she is a big part of the reason why it is hard to really care about the romance in the story. Both Pastorelli and Hoskins seem to have fun and share a handful of good lines throughout the movie while little roles for other well known faces vary between the effective (Joey Lauren Adams) and the simply pointless (did Richard Schiff really need work this badly?).Anyway, the film is not great but it is not awful either. It's mix of the sappy and the silly is pretty badly done and I was left wanting a more engaging romance and a lot more of Travolta's mockingly silly performance. All told it is maybe worth a watch once but it is far from being a good film and, if you don't like John Travolta's performance then there isn't a great deal else to watch it for.

It was just ludicrous or just plain stupid.I mean, John Travolta as a grubby angel? Smoking? Scratching his groin? Quoting the Beatles? A warring angel who knows nothing about Heaven? An angel who flirts with all the women? Yes, it's all absurd and certainly Biblically- incorrect.

Or `a' direction, at least; for when it comes to life and love, who really knows?  And the real question is, does it make a difference if you believe in angels?  A possible answer lies in Ephron's entertaining and ultimately touching film, `Michael,' in which she asks you to be a believer; and if you can, it'll loose the magic upon the screen and you'll be treated to a satisfying cinematic experience, courtesy of Ephron's insights into human nature and a guy who just may or may not be one of those most ecclesiastical of creatures, an angel.	When Frank Quinlan (William Hurt), a reporter for a national tabloid based in Chicago, gets a letter from a woman in Iowa named Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton), who claims that an angel has been living with her for the past six months, Frank's editor, Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins), dispatches him forthwith to the woman's residence, the Milk Bottle Inn (which she owns), to check it out.  Accompanying him is fellow reporter Huey Driscoll (Robert Pastorelli), and a newcomer to the team, Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell), who is supposedly an `expert' on angels.  What they expect to find when they get there is anybody's guess, but if it's someone with a halo and the proverbial `inner light,' they are about to be sorely disappointed; because when they finally meet Michael (John Travolta, complete with wings-- but are they real?), he's, well, as Michael tells them right off, himself, `I'm not that kind of angel--'  And for Frank, Dorothy and Huey, it's the beginning of a journey of sorts, as they endeavor to take Michael back to Chicago with them, hoping to learn all they can about him along the way.  But, more importantly, learning some things about themselves-- and each other-- at the same time.	By due process and by citing previous works of excellence-- like `Sleepless In Seattle' and `You've Got Mail'-- Ephron can stake a claim to the territorial rights of Matters-of-the-Heart stories and win, hands down.  Wry and subtle observations on love and relationships are her trademark; she knows how to make her characters and situations credible, and moreover, how to present it all in such a way that it makes a real connection with her audience.  She makes it look easy, but make no mistake, there's a fine art to what she does.  The fact that she can not only entertain, but touch her audiences in film after film, clearly demonstrates that she's got what it takes to create and deliver a movie with some real substance, coated as it may be with some light-hearted sentiment (just call it the icing on the cake, if you will).  And a big part of her success comes from knowing what makes her characters tick, and making them people with whom the audience can identify and relate.  Even when the story is a little bit quirky and just slightly off-center, as is the case with this film.	John Travolta as an angel?  Well, make that an `Arch'angel, and not just any old Archangel; this is Michael, the very same angel who fought Beelzebub and cast him (so he claims) from Heaven.  And, as embodied by Travolta, this is Michael, the warrior, who exists to do battle with any enemy and put matters to right-- and Travolta makes it work by creating an `angel' like none you've ever seen before.  His Michael is rather unkempt and slovenly, he smokes and has a penchant for sugar.  He also likes to laugh and dance, and he appreciates the wonders and the beauty of the earth.  Whoever he is, there's a depth of humanity there, which Travolta manages to bring to the fore of what turns out to be a rather complex and challenging character.  It's a solid performance by the charismatic Travolta, who makes Michael a truly memorable character, and in turn, a memorable film.	Hurt does a good job, as well, as the jaded Frank Quinlan, a guy obviously looking for something, but unaware of what it is, or even that he is, in fact, searching.  Hurt successfully captures the laconic essence at the heart of his character, but tempers him with just enough spirit to keep him interesting, and a person who, though not necessarily likable, is one you come to feel is at least salvageable as a human being.  In the end, he actually becomes someone you can root for, though initially Frank is rather off-putting.  The important thing is, Hurt presents Frank in a way that touches a nerve, and it demonstrates that connection Ephron makes with the audience through her characters.	MacDowell gives a strong performance, too, though rather retiring and less than spirited; but then again, that's who her character is, and she plays it quite well.  Dorothy, like Frank, is a person at a crossroads; the difference is, she's lost and she knows it-- and it gives her an endearing quality that gains the sympathy of the audience, and makes her someone for whom you want to see things work out.	The supporting cast includes Teri Garr (Judge Newberg), Joey Lauren Adams (Anita), Carla Gugino (Bride), Tom Hodges (Groom) and Wallace Langham (Bruce).  In the end, whether or not this film makes you believe in angels is a moot point, because `Michael' is an engaging film that reaffirms the indomitability of the human spirit.  And, if not angels, that is something everyone can believe in, or at least hope for.  It's Nora Ephron's way of saying that this old world is going to be around for awhile.  And it's good.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.

Michael stays at an inn when three journalists arrive to convince him to travel back to their headquarters. He agrees on two conditions. First, William Hurt must apologize exactly when he says. Secondly, Andie MacDowell must sing exactly when he says. Michael is presented here as a lover of life but he seems to have neglected the wonders of his creator. Hurt is an editor who learns to be more sensitive. Andie MacDowell is poised as an angel expert but is really an advertising mascot. Intriguing setup is full of ideas and developments directed by Nora Ephron who previously made Sleepless in Seattle. Michael's wings are convincing yet it is John Travolta's charm that sells. Hurt and MacDowell are superb as a couple who grow to love and respect each other. Robert Pastorelli steals scenes as a former reporter who has a dog in his possession. Jean Stapleton plays the elderly woman whom Michael accepts hospitality with. The film is well made in terms of its technical elements and acting but it has an element of controversy. Modernization of an angel will turn certain viewers off of what was originally conceived as pure.

John Travolta does an outstanding job. His portrayal of an angel allowed to come to earth and interact with people is just marvelous. Most of the time he seems almost as a child discovering the world around him for the first and perhaps the last time. He appears to be trying to experience everything in as short a period of time as possible. His over use of sugar on everything is just as a child would do if they could get away with it. His dance scene in the middle of the film seems to transform the picture. Although very simple it is so well executed, I never tire of watching it again and again. Worth buying and adding to the library.

Both offer John Travolta in offbeat kind of roles while still trading on his leading man sex appeal. I'm kind of surprised by the relatively low rating this picture has here (5.6 as I write this), because I thought the writers provided some fairly clever elements to Travolta's character. After all, how often do you come across the angel who kicked Lucifer out of heaven? And how can you miss with a canine co-star like Sparky? Well I guess the things that entertain some movie fans will turn off others. Some of the reviews here feel the picture denigrated the whole idea of 'angelic' angels, but then again, who wrote that rule book? I found it kind of cool that Michael (Travolta) remained true to a personal (if I may be allowed to use the word personal referring to a heavenly host) code of honor and sense of duty while accompanying Frank (William Hurt), Huey (Robert Pastorelli) and Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) on their quixotic journey. If one didn't know better, you'd really believe there's such a thing as the world's biggest ball of twine and largest non-stick frying pan.I guess you can tell I liked this picture, even if it's not in the same ballpark as say Casablanca or any other Top 100 film out there. I dig the quirky stuff along with the clever set-ups and unusual situations. If you think about it, John and Paul had to get their inspiration somewhere, and in my book, you can never have too much sugar.

And that's exactly where I was when I recently saw the film Michael again on a cable broadcast.I'll also say that I've never been a big Travolta fan; perhaps owing to the inability to ever fully erase the Fever persona from mind.But how could one not enjoy this little comic fantasy? Travolta plays the re-interpreted, hedonistic warrior Arc-Angel to perfection. I can't imagine a better casting. You can almost smell the intoxicating pheromones that lead most women to forget who they with or, in the case of a municipal judge, who they are.The supporting cast is uniformly good. True, neither John Hurt nor Andie MacDowell or others really have to stretch very far in this lighthearted fare; but it's a good cast with all-too brief appearances by Jean Stapleton and Terri Garr.Anyway, as said, this isn't a deep or thought-provoking film; though Michael's hedonistic tendencies while an earth-bound human could well test the more religiously uptight.

I've always liked William Hurt (and he up to par as usual) but have felt rather indifferent about Andie MacDowell so it came as a nice surprise that she has a pretty good singing voice. Jean Stapleton played the 'friend' and keeper who took care of Michael as he waited for his new 'mission' to arrive. You can't not like her here. I've also never thought much of Robert Pastorelli, though I am sorry for the way he ended but for me Pastorelli just didn't have any grip. He seemed suited for Murphy Brown but in every other role he just never seemed to be convincing, this was no exception either. John Travolta is at his best in these types of roles where he plays charming, sassy, irreverent Vinny Barbarino sorts of characters. Michael is an angel with one final mission on Earth and while here he wants to enjoy good food, beer, cigarettes, dancing, even fighting and carnal delights before he returns for the final time to heaven where Earthly delights will only be a fond memory. Travolta plays Michael with a sort of slovenly, disheveled charm, a sparkle in his eye and shows he can still bust a move or two on the dance floor as well ! His quirky angel is a lot of fun, and you can't help but like him as he drinks, smokes and dances his way through his journey. When he gives his last miracle to save the dog Sparky and starts to sicken, it's hard not to feel a little tear in the corner of your eye because you know there won't be more hijinks to make you chuckle. Anyways, if this movie comes on on a slow night, take a chance and watch it like I did because it will keep you entertained much better than many cheesy reality shows, and maybe surprise you.

The characterization of an angel with so many negative attributes (indeed, vices) is unique. Unfortunately, that is the end of the originality in Michael; the rest is inane and achingly predictable.Michael (charmingly played by John Travolta) is purportedly sent on a mission to redirect the lives of two supermarket tabloid reporters.  As he has no moral compass of his own, the character of his planned redirection can only be imagined.  In between childlike (some might say childish) spasms of singing to himself and dancing solo (which is meant, I think, in some round-about, inoffensive way, to show that what the world really needs is more free spirited people like Michael) he goes on a road trip to visit such magnificently tacky landmarks as the world's biggest ball of twine and the world's largest non-stick frying pan.  Oddly enough, the tabloid people--who make their living peddling commodities of like character--express no interest in any of this stuff!  They're too busy trying to work out their relationship problems.  Huh?  Isn't that what the angel is supposed to be helping them with?  At some point, it becomes clear that the tabloid reporters have greater spiritual depth than the angel whose job it is to deliver them.  Sure, from time to time Michael does offer up a few brief, inoffensive, obligatory, truisms.  But this movie has no real philosophy or spirituality, other than feel-good.   I don't know what the point of this angel business is, but it certainly has nothing to do with God.  In fact, the G-man is never once mentioned.  To deal with Him would no doubt be offensive to some.  God, or even sincere Spirituality, is more demanding and less approachable (definitely less amusing!) than a seedy, sociopathic angel.If you have any depth to your Sprituality at all, you will likely find the inoffensive Michael to be indeed offensive in its feel-good distillation of real spiritual issues.

The film is shot adequately, which can be correctly translated as blandly, and no pretentious attempt is made to create an ethereal or surreal setting. This is a story about an angel on earth. Middle America at its bleakest just isn't stimulating enough on the eye, especially when dealing with this topic. However, do not be disheartened. 'Michael' does pick up speed during the second half, becoming increasingly entertaining and ultimately leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of your tummy. John Travolta succeeds in charming his audience as the unlikely, womanising winged creature, creating a strange hybrid of New Age Man and Lovable Rogue. He mellows the slightly tacky, but almost inevitable sentimentality provided by a canine colleague and Andie MacDowell warbling country songs, so that the film remains suitably saccharine without sending you in for a root canal. The ending however, is pure, gorgeous Hollywood at its sugariest and should have the majority of hardened cynics smiling inwardly. One to rent if you're broke and there is nothing on television.

You will find yourself questioning how a loving God could have allowed this movie to been written, acted in, or distributed. It is a sick, twisted world we live in. I can bear the idea of a sloppy, smoking, sugar-sucking slob with wings who women find seductive and can't tell a joke, but this movie is so meaningless and uninspiring that it is an insult to all that is worth living for.I believe the actors must have been forced into making this movie - it was so clear from their acting that they really hated it, and were in anguish over whether they would live to see their loved ones ever again. In away, I felt sorry for them, which I could not have done if I really believed that they had chosen to act in this movie of their own free will.From the very beginning it was the worst-acted, most plot less, mind-numbing movie I had ever seen, and I naively believed that it had to get better, because it simply could not get worse. But it did. It just got worse and worse, and I found myself in the downward-spiraling cycle of the depression and self-doubt that can only be induced by witnessing such marvelous stupidity. If I were Lucifer I would have hurled myself into a lake of fire at the thought of spending 10 minutes with Michael or any of the supporting characters, much less eternity.

Stop wondering. I'm telling you, Michael is it!It is not heartwarming, entertaining, or Travolta at his best. It just sucks. If I had kids, I would let them watch Deep Throat before Michael!A sold-out John Travolta, a washed-up and balding William Hurt, and an about to die any time now Jean Stapleton highlight this turd of a film.But wait...you'll get to hear Andie McDowell sing! Yeah. Hollywood really s**t all over us with this one!

John Travolta was okay, but weak most times. Bruce Willis, Tom Hanks, Mel Gibson or possibly even Tom Cruise (maybe not with Tom) would have done a better job of the lead role.Andie McDowell does a wonderful job of being sweet and kind. She must be that way in person, God I hope so, it would be so heartbreaking to think such a beautiful, precious woman would be otherwise. She's a pleasure just to watch. She's not the most perfect woman, but she sure does make you think she is for longer than any actress. True she shows flaws in her character and this one is kind of hard to understand, but the script to this movie sucks... oh, please let me put that in the next paragraph, such comment should not be included in the same paragraph with Andie.The script for this movie sucks! The directing is ok, but the writing is not very good. The best part of the movie is the music... like a Frank Sinatra tune. The scenery is interesting, is there such a place as the non-stick frying pan home or birthplace in the world.If you are in a life and death situation and watching this movie will save you... then ok then it would be worthwhile to watch this flic.

It turns out that an angel really is visiting earth. John Travolta plays archangel Michael; although charming, he is also untidy, a little over weight, seedy and womanizing. Heaven sent?Intended to be a light comedy; I found it short of being a good snooze. The name Travolta did very little magic for this project.This movie has a lot of stars, but giving below par performances William Hurt, Bob Hoskins and Jean Stapleton. Andie MacDowell seemed clueless. Robert Pastorelli did very well with the part he was given. Teri Garr sparkled in her few moments on the screen. The trailers looked so promising, but the end result seems more like a waste of talent. Mildly funny, with more ho-hums than chuckles.

Awful. And there's a reason for it. And it's likely a lot of people have scratched their heads over this very same issue.Every time Nora has a success she calls in sister Delia to help on the next project. And it never works. Now Nora is credited with some fine work she wrote Harry/Sally and she wrote and directed Sleepless in Seattle. That's good stuff, well written and wonderfully executed.But what has sister Delia helped with? Ah! How about Mixed Nuts, one of Steve Martin's worst comedies ever? How about You've Got Mail, which had some Hanks/Ryan fans almost throwing in the towel?How about Bewitched? Many have not yet seen this one, but given the name of the author, you can start to get an idea.And Hanging Up? It's a wonder cinemas where it was shown weren't trashed.And finally - how about Michael? Yes, how about Michael? More shouldn't be necessaryIt's yet another collaboration between the eminently gifted and often inspired Nora and that sister of hers who somehow seems (sorry) to ruin any project she comes into contact with.You'll squirm in your seat, keep close track of the time and an eye on the emergency exit, and suggest to your friends you all go out right away and see a good movie for a change.

Don't they have any pride left in their puny little damaged-by-Holywood bodies?A movie starring William Hurt and Robert Pastorelli, the two most boring actors in America who can't utter one single line without it sounding like they have a migraine. Then use a hip actor, like John Travolta who everyone thought was the coolest guy on earth after Pulp Fiction. I did too, but after this movie I have lost all respect for him. Throw in a good looking woman, of the old-fashioned girl kind. We don't want any slutty 90's women, no, use Andie McDowell, America's moral majority's own little chastity persona. And finally, throw in a cute little dog for good measure, and there you have it. A sentimental, moral, pathetic, ridiculous, silly, stupid, inane, infantile, boring, unbelievable, crappy, pseudo-sad piece of elk poo.Oh wow, angel who curses, drinks and has sex! How daring! How brave! How controversial! Kiss my ass!

They portrayed angels very badly. First of all, Gabriel is the Archangel, and Michael is another name for Jesus. And Second, Angels dont have a limited number of times they can come to earth, they dont wear boxers, they dont invite any girl thats asking to their rooms, they dont drink alcohol or smoke, and they don't have wings that molt. Angels don't have wings with feathers like we would see on a bird, their wings are very different. I don't even think they have feathers on their wings, but they might. They don't eat and look like slobs and they aren't dirty. And they don't come to earth to make buildings fall down for little old ladies. They don't come to see the world's largest ball of twine, or the biggest non-stick frying pan, and they dont use people or their power to get what they want. They come to help us sometimes when we are searching for God and can't find him. They show us through the way they live (while they are here) the way that God is and they reflect Him in themselves.

I got soooooo sick of John Travolta smoking and his behavior as an angel......makes me rather go to Hell than to even consider an angel like his character looming about Earth. Shameless garbage....not worth the time it took to view.  My thumbs are sooooo down low.....think THEY might have reached Hell by now.
