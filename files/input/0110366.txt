What did you expect from a kids movie, to come out of it feeling inspired? No, it's just a happy-go-lucky kids movie which i can proudly say i have watched over and over again to this day! And one user commented 'How do the kids expect to marry women in the future, with a Woman Haters club' ? Oh my god, get over yourself! Although i haven't seen the original to this, i can praise this version as a feel good film.The basic plot is about Spanky and Alfalfa, childhood friends, who have a group called the 'He-man Women Haters club' with their other pals Porky, Buckwheat, Froggy and so on. Though Secretly, Alfalfa loves girls and has a girlfriend,Darla, who he one day has lunch with in the Boys club! When the boys find out Alfalfa lied, they ruin his lunch with Darla (Kitty Litter sandwiches and so-called grape juice!). Unfortunately and accidentally, the clubhouse burns on fire, and the boys must enter a go kart race to win money to fund repairs for their clubhouse! An excellent movie whatever other people say! 9/10 and im sticking to  it!

It regards a group of children who hang out at a club house with a strict rule against girls. This becomes a problem when one of the members is caught courting a little girl. This is the film's first problem. There might be nostalgia for fans of the classic TV show but for a family film this presents themes that may be above the age group this is aimed at. The relationship between one of the Rascals and the girl comes off somewhat disturbing in terms of dialogue that skirts adult. After the club house burns down they attempt to raise money and the method is a kids race for a cash prize. This might have been the proper angle to present this material. Director Penelope Spheeris is coming off great success with Wayne's World but here she is backed by a production that resembles the classic program but without a screenplay worthy of it. It doesn't even seem nostalgic for those whom may celebrate the popular TV program. The young cast play out their roles with certain appeal but the adult communication is a distraction. Another issue is the lack of parents. There is numerous celebrity cameos supporting the show's popularity but the end result is a bigger mess than anything the rascals conjure up.

It was definitely a spin off of the Our Gang serious from the Depression Era, however it was made to be modern with a few familiar twists. They were '90s Kids doing what Kids do! Just like the 'Our Gang' children were Kids doing Kid things from that era!Even though there were some copies from the original in the movie, it was all in good fun. Remember, it is a CHILDREN/family movie. I grew up watching both 'The Little Rascals' and 'Our Gang' and I don't think that the Little Rascals disgraced 'Our Gang' in any way whatsoever. Yes, there were similarities and some copy catting, but so what? It is after all a Children's movie about Children doing things that Children like to do in their time frame.

I liked this movie as a child and most other kids I knew enjoyed it too. But&#x85;as an adult I feel differently about it.Spanky (Travis Tedford) and his best friend Alfalfa (Bug Hall) are the founders of the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club, a club of little boys who get together and do boy things without girls. But when Alfalfa falls in puppy love with a girl named Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), Spanky and his other friends do everything to sabotage the relationship. And when Alfalfa accidentally burns down their clubhouse the other boys have completely had it with him, and force him to guard their prized go-cart day and night. Meanwhile, Darla has fallen for a new rich boy Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing), but Alfalfa is still determined to get her back. Everything boils down to the local fair when the boys try to win the go-cart derby, raise enough money to rebuild the clubhouse, and mend broken friendships.This movie is&#x85;weak. The plot itself isn't that bad, and most children who watch it are entertained, but it's just not good. The overwhelming problem with this film is that none of the kids can act their way out of a paper bag. The fact that none of the kids have been in anything more than a few made for TV or straight to video movies since this proves that. Honestly I found the outtakes of the kids' mistakes funnier than the movie itself. In terms of being based off the original Little Rascals shorts, they don't have much to do with them aside from the same looks and names as the originals. That being said it's hard to relate children of the 90s to children of the 20's, 30's and 40's. A lot of the old ones are based on poverty, hunger, and child abuse as a part of their lives, along with other themes that were anachronistic or not applicable to children of the 90's. But they tried to integrate some themes like the go cart derby, Alfalfa singing and the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club. With that all said this is still a movie that would entertain most children under ten, but can quickly get annoying for parents that have to sit through it with them. "},{"Title":"I hate films that try to be cute, but I don't hate this.","Date":"9 September 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Romance","Review":" Films and television shows that are trying to be cute to gain laughs can be quite irritating. They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character, or young toddler, that says lines that no young kid would say, and the usual reaction is Aaawwww! (Full House did this for years). These types of cinema have no reason for existence, and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do, no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But, where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these little rascals live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses, and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way.Little Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is in a group of girl-hating little boys, and they find out about his upcoming romantic date with Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and they sabotage him. Meanwhile a new rich kid Waldo (Blake Ewing) has just moved in and Darla finds him quite appealing, so Alfalfa is down in the dumps. Hopefully the up-coming go-cart race is a chance for Alfalfa to get his lady back, in addition to beat Waldo, and bond with his child pal Spanky (Travis Tedford).This kids in this movie are actually all really good actors, and that's one thing that makes this movie work. Bug Hall is one of the better young actors out there, and all the ridiculous silly lines that the kids say (though kids clearly wouldn't say in real life) are said with enough conviction, yet with a clear wink from the director and writer(s). The kids say their lines well, but with a slightly over the top script, and the mixture comes off as pretty funny. The film runs at a brisk pace, with enough jokes to make up for it's overall lack of plot. The sets would have to be pretty cool looking to a child (at least they were to me!). The clubhouse that the kids built is designed to look like it was built by kids, but at the same time, it's so surreally elaborate. And this movie has plenty of surrealism and absurdest humor. Things will happen that make very little sense, but come off as hilarious because of how ridiculous the situation is. In one scene during the big race at the end, giant daggers come out of a kid's car and start stabbing another car. It's so ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it comes off as normal in this universe, and jokes like this that might normally seem very over the top, play off quite well. If anything was unnecessary here, it was the numerous cameos that usually show up for no reason at all. A few of them were funny, but most of them seemed somewhat forced. Kids probably won't know who most of these people are anyways, so they won't understand that these are cameos.Overall, this is a very enjoyable family film, with good performances (from kids no less), and a lot of really silly jokes that hit the mark. In an average episode of Full House, I probably cringe about 10 times, but in this much longer film featuring even more kids including cameos by the Olsen Twins, there was not one moment of cringing. It's actually pretty fun.My rating *** out of ****. 82 mins. PG for some rude humor.

I am sort of obsessed with the original Our Gangs, and this movie was nothing compared to them. A lot of people have said The acting wasn't that great, but what can you expect, they're kids? I say, they found kids for the originals that were genius actors, so why couldn't they find any for the movie? Also, why did they mix together all the different time periods? Mary Ann Jackson (the little girl with the bobbed dark brown hair) left the shorts long before Porky ever joined them and they were both in the movie. There were some good moments in the movie, like when Spanky's wig got pulled off by a tree, but the horrible acting and the way they messed with basically the whole idea of Our Gang overshadows the good moments. And now, when I mention in casual conversation that I like the Little Rascals, inevitably, someone will say Oh, yeah, I liked that movie too! and start singing I've got a pickle, I've got a pickle! or something similar. I'm being generous and giving the movie four out of ten stars because I liked it when I was little. I know I've gone on a long nasty rant, but that's really what I think about the movie.

The children actors as the Rascals themselves did a good job with their roles with Bug Hall and Buckwheat (can't remember who the actor was) and Spanky stealing the show. The rich kid, Waldo, although underused, was still tolerable. I also saw some great cameos including John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg, and Mel Brooks himself. The pacing is very brisk and helps develop our character quite well. The music's from William Ross was pretty decent, although it needs a much more elaborate depth.The best aspect is the humor.

Every great group has had to overcome obstacles in order to develop and maintain their strength. The He- Man Women Haters Club is filled with tension and animosity towards members between the group and the infamous Darla that snatched the heart of Alfalfa.Loyalty is very important to the members of the He-Man Woman Haters club. Although Alfalfa is tested and tried throughout the movie by his comrades and his childhood crush; he prevails. Spanky, the best friend of Alfalfa is infuriated by the discreet passions that his friend Alfalfa possesses for the young lady Darla. Throughout the movie, Darla and Alfalfa try to establish a bond, but they are always interrupted, whether it is by pranks of Women's Hater's Club, or rich guys such as Waldo that crept into Darla's life to take away the feelings that she had for Alfalfa.Often, in the movie the producer showed a great sense of the lack of knowledge or understanding that kids possess and how they often think without speaking. It was funny to see how the kids wanted to meet the race car driver at the end of the championship and to see how they were disgruntled because they expected to see a man. Surprisingly, the person that presented the prize to the Woman Haters Club, was the person that the gang had desired to meet along. The surprise just lied in the fact that the person was a woman and not a man. Not to mention, Spanky's disgust for women was challenged when he asked the female race car driver to give him a kiss on his cheek.Movies such as Little Rascals are rarities in 2011. Most of the films that we see today are filled with sex, violence, and theft. Even the kids are the ones committing the very acts in the movie, and it is saddening. One of my favorite movies of all time that has a similar prank-like feature assimilated into the film is Home Alone. The movie Home Alone is filled with pranks and laughter for the entire family and if you enjoyed Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy. Home Alone.

Kids allowed to roam all over town alone? It just was not safe really...but in the Our Gang films it was O-Tay...bad guys simply did not exist as they do today. I imagine getting these little kids to do as the director wanted was not easy. Distractions would be everywhere on a movie set. I know in the originals they would say and do mean things to the kids to get them to cry on cue...that was long before there were rules and laws against it.

With the exception of Alfalfa and the two cute black kids, the acting was horrible, esp. Darla!. Darla was looking at the camera a couple of times. Spanky's expressions and hand motions were too awkward and looked rehearsed. There was a few kids in the club that did not sing or even make any facial expressions of enthusiasm or otherwise. The monkey, on the hand, was great! Also, I thought some parts of the script were,awkward and the lines sounded unnatural for a child to say.

The kids portraying them look just like their 1930s counterparts! The boys have started their own club- The He-Man Woman Haters Club. Positively no girls allowed. Spanky was the president. The kids were going to enter the annual go-cart race this year like always. They've built a real cool racer. Their idol was race car driver A.J. Ferguson; The chosen driver was Alfalfa, who was not present at the club meeting. When the boys went to look for him, they found him romancing young Darla Hood on the lake. Alfalfa set up a date for them tomorrow at the clubhouse because the guys would be out swimming. Spanky and the gang devise a plan.        Alfalfa is chased by neighborhood bullies Butch and Woim, but finally makes it to the clubhouse and the date goes great, until Spanky and the gang pull off their plan, which included a whoopie cushion on Alfalfa's chair and kitty litter sandwiches. A chain of events causes the clubhouse to burn down. Spanky and Stymie borrow a fire hose while Buckwheat and Porky call the fire department, but can't remember the number for 911; Darla breaks up with Alfalfa and goes out with the new rich kid in town, Waldo Aloycious Johnston III. And as if that weren't bad enough, Alfalfa was put on trial for deceit and betrayal and the destruction of their clubhouse so he was sentenced by Judge Spanky to watch over the go-cart night and day. So the next day while Alfalfa did his time, Spanky and the gang went out to buy lumber for a new clubhouse. They try taking out a loan at Mel Brooks' bank but are unsuccessful. Probably because their account number was 7. Darla becomes even angrier at Alfalfa when Buckwheat and Porky misdeliver a note Alfalfa supposidly wrote for her.         The county fair had come to town so Spanky and the gang set up a tent to get money. They advertised a six foot man-eating chicken Uh-Huh standing on a crate eating a bucket of chicken. Alfalfa finds out Spanky was responsible for his break-up so he and Petey jump in the go- cart and head to the fair. Spanky humiliates Alfalfa when he goes on stage to sing pretty for Darla and the two call off their friendship. And as if that weren't bad enough, Butch and Woim steal the go-cart. After some convincing, Alfalfa and Spanky reconcile and together, with the gang, they build a new go-cart out of assorted items around the neighborhood and are ready for the race! Buckwheat's mom (Whoopi Goldberg) was there, so was Waldo's dad (Donald Trump). Waldo's racer was a space-age rocket with all sorts of gadgets. The race was on and with luck, Alfalfa and Spanky win! Darla and Alfalfa get back together after he takes out Butch and Woim and when the clubhouse is rebuilt, it has become a He-Man Woman Likers club.          A real cute movie. Like I said, the kids in this movie look so much like their 1930s counterparts, which aren't really alive anymore. In fact, I think the only surviving Little Rascal is Butch! There's an all-star cast here Reba McEntire, Mel Brooks, Lea Thompson, Daryl Hannah, Donald Trump, Whoopi Goldberg, George Wendt, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. So if you haven't already seen The Little Rascals and if you're a fan of the classic Our Gang shorts, check out this movie. I'm sure you will enjoy it.

These kids are insanely cute and just hilarious.  I've seen the original Little Rascals and it doesn't compare to the updated version.  This is by no means a family movie just for kids, I've seen a group of college students lose it watching this show.  Think Denice the Menace meets Little Orphan Annie.  The movie follows a group of seven year olds who are members of the He-Man Women Haters club.  It deals with such heavy topics as why girls are gross, what makes a truly great go-cart and what being a man in the 90's is all about. Give Little Rascals a watch and you'll remember how great childhood can be.

It's curious that there could be children living among 90s references who dress in clothes from fifty years ago, but then this could just be a tiny mid-western town. These boys are so disillusioned with girls, probably because of stereotypes created by their fathers, that they create a club just to alienate females and act what they think macho is. And then walks Alfalfa who has found his female side and is secure in it. The magic of the kid's world as it percieves adults is wonderfully portrayed by these young actors. Bug Hall, Travis Tedford and Kevin Holmes are wonderful in their roles and should go far as actors, but Brittany Holmes, cute as she is, doesn't have the charm of the original Darla Hood. The movie does copy the original charm of the series as it duplicates all of the most memorable scenes and creates new ones as well. The cameos of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are wonderful, but no where as memorable as the ones by George Wendt, Mel Brooks, Whoopi Goldberg, Lea Thompson, Donald Trump, Darryl Hannah and Reba McEntire. The bloopers at the end are cute but unnecessary, but it is a shame that a tv series couldn't have been spawned out of all of this.

If you ask me, the way that Alfalfa (Bug Hall) fell for Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes) was absolutely romantic. When they were together in a scene, I felt really warm and tingly inside. However, when they had a fight, I wanted to cry. It's hard for me to explain the reasons for this. Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, I liked Alfalfa's the best. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances to any fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

That said, this movie had it tough from the                               beginning. The idea of incorporating an early 20th-century childhood into the                               90's didn't work on all levels, but it didn't ruin the film, either. The too-young                               cast members look very much like the original rascals, but the charm is missing.                               Only the boys who played Buckwheat and Alfalfa have some charisma, while the                               rest come off as mimics. The bloopers at the end are cute, but do nothing except                               show the ineptitude of its cast. That aside, the movie is good for a few laughs and                               there are plenty of celebrity cameos throughout. Kids are guaranteed to love it.                               And if they do, rent a tape of the old, black & white shorts, too. My younger                               brothers would take those over this movie any day.

But The Little Rascals, and Disney's Candleshoe are the only films he deemed worth to get on the new Blu Ray Hi Def format. On Blu-Ray, The Little Rascals doesn't disappoint. Both the audio and video are handled very well and the special features are more than enough.The picture looks great, sporting a pretty sharp and crisp look. The strong, vibrant colours bounce off the screen in this visually enthralling film. Detail levels takes a hit here and there but for the most part it looks fine. A few minor issues hold the transfer back from being perfect but it's certainly nothing to look down upon.When it comes to the audio, The Little Rascals is a beast. The wicked soundtrack shines here as every song sounds flawless. Dialogue is clear as can be and never gets lost amidst the sounds of merry mirth and bickering rascals. Speaking of merry mirth and bickering rascals, they both sound great. Bickerings boom through the speakers and the sounds of bullets ricocheting and gunfire popping sound perfect. All the sound effects have a real punchy feel to them and it makes for an immersive experience.The film continues to deliver when it comes to special features. First up is the 'The Little Rascals Bonus View Mode' which is kind of like a picture in picture mode. We see some behind the scenes footage, some interviews and some commentary by the director. You can also watch the film normally with an audio commentary by the Cast but it's far less interesting.When it comes down to it, The Little Rascals on Blu-Ray is a great package. The movie itself is undoubtedly one of the best of humanities efforts and the transfer doesn't disappoint either. The making of documentary is great and the additional features are the icing on the cake. It's a fantastic film and one that is certainly worth your money.

I'm not joking. I would rather tattoo 'Pocket Ninjas 4 life' across my chest with Brad Bufanda's face beneath it. Luckily, throughout the movie I was considerably stoned, and if I hadn't been, I probably would have gone downtown with a knife looking for something to kill. This movie made me the most angry I had ever been, which is surprising because I never get angry. Anyway...The movie starts out with a gang of homosexual children (who fear women more than having acid thrown in their faces) who are members of a club located in some decrepit shed, the proprietor (a 7 year old child) not in the least concerned about the state of the shed, nor what could be lurking inside it. This is just one mistake that the producers made, out of hundreds, most of them can be called 'Common sense & logic deficiency error'. There are so many factual errors, continuity errors, audio errors, and any type of error within this movie that there are at least 3 happening at any given moment, from start to finish. For a start, what kind of parent would let their 7 year old child roam free through wherever they are (Detroit?) and get pursued by a pair of crackhead 12 year old mulletheads, congregate within a shed that's falling to pieces, and follow a child called Alfalfa trying to get him to leave a joke of a relationship he has with -holds breath- a girl. I lost track of the movie from around that time. Had I been alone, I would have started screaming at the television. Had I taken acid, I would have died. Actually, if you gave me anything (sedatives, benzo's) something would have been stabbed or broken. Had someone injected a pound of crystallized Valium directly into my brain, I still would have gone into some hysterical stabbing frenzy.Maybe.

Imagine having to watch a full-length movie about a group of children who act like that for the entire length of the movie. Imagine how you would react if these monsters were real? Probably not too happily, but as an audience, I think people are actually expected to be more like the type who would go oh, isn't that cute? No!I'm not a child hater. I even work with children, kindergarteners as a matter of fact, which I believe are around the age of what these children are supposed to be. Except the film versions don't act like real children. Instead, they run around like misguided...I don't even know whats, spouting lines written by adults who probably haven't been children for about thirty years and therefore have no idea how they can really behave cutely while still acting semi-appealing. They don't even seem to realize that two six-year-olds(or whatever) would not know how to use a rowboat, much less be peacefully gliding in the middle of the lake singing You Are So Beautiful, which kids really wouldn't know, or if they did, they probably wouldn't like. Children also wouldn't know how to build a clubhouse and its in really poor taste they their parents never ever seem to be around. In fact, if the little rascals were real, they would probably be thrown in foster homes, due to the utter lack of supervision provided to them. But in movie-land they're not. They just go on happily, torn between hating girls or loving them, fueding with the new rich kid(Blake Ewing, who is assumingly supposed to be their age but looks about 14) and being in some go-cart race, as if those really exist today. They also get into lots of mischief, like the other boys sabotaging Alfalfa(Bug Hall) and his girlfriend's lunch, and again terrorizing the girlfriend's ballet recital which had very very slapsticky results.

Those kids will never grow up.A clubhouse gets burned down mainly due to Spanky who made Alfalfa and Darla's picnic lunch living hell with oil to make it look like grape soda, and kitty litter in the sandwiches. I mean you can't blame it all on Alfalfa who accidentally forgot to blow out the last candle on the candle set. Well i know why he forgot, because he heard the guys and he wanted to hurry Darla out of there before they said something. Spanky kind of lead him on to burning the clubhouse. And you know you don't put out fires with waterballoons. That certainly did not get them anywhere.Then things get worse when Darla dumps him because she believed that he placed the oil in the grape soda and the kitty litter in the sandwiches and then she dates the richest kid in town and also when the go cart gets stolen from the bullies when Alfalfa was getting ready to sing a song for Darla. And then Stymie said he was messing up left and right. It was SPANKY messing up left and right for poor Alfalfa. Spanky was making the club ready to turn on each other. Alfalfa and Spanky soon make up, build another go cart, attend the race, and they win the race after all the trouble they made. They build another clubhouse and they invite women to join.I mean Dennis The Menace is better than this. I wish they never made this movie. I was watching Little Rascals a lot in seventh grade only because I felt like I was in the same situation as they were, always fighting always getting the blame for everything and that's the only reason why I watched it. Just like what was going on in the seventh grade.  "}]
