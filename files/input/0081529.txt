It was one of the last movies seen by Elvis, who arranged a private viewing due to it's popularity. I myself, barely a teenager, saw it several times in the theater.Now, when a sequel was announced, we all just knew it would pick up where the first one left off and follow the gang's exploits up to Boston and back to Georgia in 48 hours with clam chowder for the Enoses. But no, the producers and writers chose to create an entirely new exploit, which is basically a rehash of the route traveled in the first, but going in the other direction and pretty much at the speed limit! First off, the Enoses could have hired anyone for a lot less money, as obviously time was not of the essence. Afterall, after they accept the job, considerable time is spent getting the Bandit back into shape! Or did the writers expect us to believe it only took one day? They may have, considering they also threw in a scene where Burt, during his rehab outruns a racehorse. And what were they thinking having Carrie marrying Junior again? Sheriff Justice said at the end of the first he wasn't giving up his pursuit of Bandit, so he didn't need this motivation, again.So, obviously, instead of a good ole' boy movie like the first, we have a cartoon with humans! See Jackie Gleason utter sombitch 6 dozen times! Hear Dom Deluise spout nonsensical Italian phrases! Watch truckers run over police cruisers with no regards to consequences (like causing lawman's death)! Become aghast at Jerry Reed turning into a tough guy life coach. Experience Burt Reynolds trying to show he has a heart! Look at Sally Field's expression of disdain for her agent! And don't miss the ending blooper reel!This was the beginning of the end for Burt as he started becoming a caricature of himself. People began to view his movies as just an excuse for Burt and his buddies to get together and party while not having to bother themselves with any strenuous acting.

While the film had it's moments, especially with Jackie Gleason as Buford T. Justice, there really wasn't much to redeem this film.Everything about the film seemed rather contrived, especially the comedy.  The comedy seemed to be forced most of the time.While I can watch the first film over and over and it never seems to get old for me, the second film wore out its welcome almost right away.  I don't know, but maybe if they hadn't tried so hard with the second film to measure up to the first film it would have been better.

Hey, listen, this film is no strain to the synapses. It's another Hal Needham carwreck fest wrapped up in a really dumb plot that at times tries too hard. However, I find an odd entertainment value in this genus of southern cheese. An aging professional highway show-off, an even more annuated hick sheriff in hot pursuit, an oddly swift and resilient Trans Am, a very talented yet dumbed down leggy sidekick, a country singer turned epitomal southern truck driver, Dom Deluise, and an elephant. Add plenty of incompetent law enforcement officers and marlboro reds and you have the makings of one fine redneck cross-country chase movie. I don't know why but I actually enjoyed this. It's really about the stunts I think and when it comes to Hal Needham you never can have too many car crashes. In the spirit of Cannonball Run and the Dukes of Hazzard there is an odd appeal in watching good IL boys tear up backroads to the tune of Hank Williams and police sirens. And of course there's always a way out leaving a pile of police cruisers in the dust behind. It's an action flick and as such you shouldn't expect it to be anything other than what it is; it's just fun to watch. You may notice it does have some very talented actors so it begs the what were you thinking doing this film? question. Perhaps. But on face value it's all about the car chase.

In the film (and in the outtakes played at the end), Field seems edgy and defensive, which probably means she got a good look at this screenplay and felt trapped (an understandable reaction, but deadly in a comedy). Written by Jerry Belson and Brock Yates from a treatment by Michael Kane, the movie immediately gets off on the wrong foot with Field once again running out on a wedding (to Sheriff Justice's son for the second time). Seems she can't reach the Bandit, whose inflated ego and sense of self-importance has alienated all his friends. Moody, unhappy Burt Reynolds only perks up in his scenes with Dom DeLuise, but for the most part limps through these half-hearted proceedings like a celebrity on the downhill slide. Hal Needham's direction isn't any help (he's at the mercy of the woebegone script), but there is an elephant around for the occasional sight-gag--and Jackie Gleason in three roles. * from **** "},{"Title":"The Bandit and Snowman at It again","Date":"5 December 2010","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" well the bandit and snowman are back and this time they have one hell of a big adventure.

If you look at each of the cameos, you see they have no tie to the storyline, all they have in common is Reynolds and Gleason.  If you want to see a much better Burt Reynolds / Dom Delouis movie, rent CR (it's hokey too, but not quite as bad as this).Movies like this get made all the time, where a very basic plot line is sketched out, and then the rest is filled in as the writers on the set come up with it.  When good ideas get scarce, they try to fill the gaps with gags on a common theme.  But like any good joke, it's only funny when it is at least semi-plausible.  That's what made the original Smokey and the Bandit so much fun.  But S&tB II is just TOO unbelievable to be funny any more. It might appeal to 12 year olds, but the original audience of 16-25 year olds just don't find them funny.All the negativeness of the above aside, S&tB II is still better than part III.

Sounds easy & Bi & Little Enos decide to hire the Bandit (Burt Reynolds) to make the run, they agree to pay $400,000 for delivery of the crate which the Bandit can't turn down since he has become a drunk has been since his Coors beer run. Again teaming up with the Snowman (Jerry Reed) & Carrie (Sally Field) they find out that the crate contains a pregnant Elephant 7 the run won't be as easy as they first thought as Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) is on their tail all the way in pursuit...Also known under the title Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again here in the UK this was directed by Hal Needham this is your pretty average more of the same sequel to the original hit Smokey and the Bandit (1977) which I didn't like that much anyway, I can't say Smokey and the Bandit II was any better but I can't say it was any worse either. Like a lot of sequels that try to leech of the original's success Smokey and the Bandit reunites all the main character's including the Bandit, Snowman, Carrie & Sheriff Buford T. Justice along with Big & Little Enos who again hire the Bandit for some ridiculous run across states, instead of beer like the original this time around it gets even sillier with a pregnant Elephant that develops a crush on the Bandit, yeah that's the level of sophistication in this sequel. The comedy & gags are just lame with many being direct rip-offs of the original especially a lot of Sheriff Justice's lines, I really don't think I laughed once during this & if the film wasn't silly enough there's this annoying Italian doctor. The script tires to have a little more humanity this time around with it wanting us to feel sorry for the animal & the on-going more pronounced romance between the Bandit & Carrie but it's all lost in a horrible plot that is just too ridiculous for words & really unfunny comedy. At almost 100 minutes it goes on for too long as well, the pace is average with not that much actually happening & only the big showdown between the police & truckers in the desert at the end is worth watching this for. The character of the Bandit is also significantly different here, here he's a drunk burnt out depressed has been unlike the first & it's hard to warm to him or want him to succeed.A lot of the time is spent with the Elephant & it's problems rather than the driving aspect, in fact the cars seem almost secondary here until the end & that desert pile up which even then is silly & hardly makes the thing worth watching. A roller-coaster is destroyed in an OK scene but otherwise this is quite short on action. Again Sheriff Justice swears quite a lot & again the dubbed TV versions are apparently quite funny. Better made than the original the coverage of the stunts is better but still rather static. Country and Western singer Don Williams & his band make a cameo, I still thought the Country and Western soundtrack was awful though & really can't stand the stuff.Filmed mostly in Florida this has good production values as I am sure the budget was bigger than the original's but that didn't help make this any good, did it? The acting is OK< Reynolds is in cruise control, Sally Field still looks nice, Jackie Gleason is still over the top while Dom DeLuise is simply awful.Smokey and the Bandit II is much more of the same really only sillier & even less funnier than the original, the final chase in the desert is alright & it passes the time if you can see it on telly for free I suppose but otherwise there's not much here to enjoy.

From highlights in Boogie Nights and The Mean Machine to real clunkers like Striptease, Reynolds has never been consistent in his movies with the exception of being consistently inconsistent. Redneck rampage classic Smokey And The Bandit was one of Burt's best so it was no surprise when the predictable sequel arrives and it's a serious test of how much vehicular destruction you like in a movie. It also proves that a movie needs much more than comedic cops and smashed squad cars to make a plot.Reynolds returns as the legendary Bandit, a hero among the high-speed CB radio community. Washed up and a wreckage of a man after Carrie (Sally Field once again) leaves him, Bandit is reunited with his old buddy Snowman (Jerry Read) and Carrie in order to transport an elephant from Florida to Texas in three days. The promise of a substantial reward is apparently motive enough because I couldn't find any other reason to do this. Anyway, Bandit is tracked every mile of the way by persistent Sheriff Buford T Justice (Jackie Gleason) and his wet-behind-the-ears son (Mike Henry) and this time, he's brought a few family reinforcements...You can picture the meeting of the producers before shooting began. Let's get everything that made the first film great and double it. So we have more cars and crashes, more stunts and jumps, more trucks, a prolonged love-hate story between Field and Reynolds as well as Dom DeLuise as a slightly eccentric Italian doctor, more Buford T Justice and oh yes, even more crashes. Sadly, the mix is a mess. The film's plot veers this way and that like one of Buford's pursuits and very little ever makes sense. Coupled with a comic-book approach to the story (Burt doing a standing back-flip onto the back of the elephant?) and the first film's action gives way to simplistic and unconvincing set-pieces. Gleason easily acts everyone else off the screen, which is not good when you sympathise with the baddie of the piece while watching our crew of redneck racers with ambivalence. Come the film's climax, there is an overwhelming sense of 'deja vu' as increasingly chaotic scenes fail to impress.In truth, there wasn't much they could do with the sequel. The first, while hardly a classic itself, pretty much covered all the bases when it came to road movies so what Smokey And The Bandit 2 thought it could add to the mix remains a mystery because this film does nothing but improve your opinion of the first (if you've seen it, anyway). Like the first, this is a mildly diverting film in a just-returned-from-pub kinda way but quite frankly, you'd be better renting something else or re-watching a DVD. Stick with the first but don't touch this or the third unless you're an extremely forgiving viewer. And Reynolds really should have trimmed that moustache...

Therefore a sequel was inevitable. In fact... a sequel was the natural evolution considering how the original ended. However, what people got was a different beast all together.Instead of directly continuing from the original, we have a new tale, utilising the old characters. Only it doesn't feel particularly new, more rehashed. If it was made now, it might almost be considered a 'remake.' The 'Bandit' is back, only he's all burned out and only tempted out of his alcohol-induced retirement by the promise of a big paycheque. Again, he has to drive across country, helping his trucker chum 'Snowman' to safely get his cargo to its destination. It's basically the same story as before. Again, it uses the same route. Again, it uses the same plot device of 'Smokey' (the cop constantly pursuing Bandit) only really chasing him because his son's bride has left him &#x96; yes, again &#x96; at the altar to run off with Bandit.It all feels a little like 'rinse and repeat.' Smokey catches up with Bandit. Bandit just so happens to know someone that can help him out. They block Smokey. The Bandit escapes and then it all happens again a few scenes later.Smokey's police car also seems to get completely trashed and yet be perfectly be okay to indulge in yet another high speed chase a little way down the highway. Of course the chases scenes are fun. At the time of production, the film boasted about having the most expensive car chase ever filmed for a movie. And there is one that lives up to that titled. Only one. Much of the driving seems to be done at the correct speed limit, meaning there's a distinct lack of tension going on.Yes, the stars return. And they do add an element of fun to the movie. If you liked them the first time round you'll probably like them again this time. However, since they're doing almost exactly the same thing as you saw them do in number one, then there's little point in watching them do it all over again, right?

Justice. I've always been of the ilk that tries not to judge sequels on the originals, but in the case of Smokey and the Bandit II it's impossible.The plot is essentially the same as the first film, with the more politically-correct elephant replacing 400 cases of good ol' Coors, and for a higher stake - $320,000 more than their original run to Texarkana. While Reynolds, Field, Reed et al are entertaining and do the best with a mediocre repeat of the original plot, the true star here is Gleason. Particularly memorable is the scene where Justice and Junior stop for a toilet break and Junior announces after paying a visit, that his zipper is stuck. What happens next is hilarious, and I won't spoil it.I agree with one of the other reviews in that the original premise of the characters as defined in the original was completely ignored in this sequel, but maybe this was done on purpose. Maybe the writers felt they were giving the characters more depth. This is the downfall of the movie, that and the script...especially the inclusion of brothers Reggie and Gaylord Justice.Having said that, it's not completely awful. The saving graces are Gleason, Dom DeLuise as the leading gynaecologist (or gornocolagalist as he pronounces it) in Pompeii (population 23) on a sabbatical to the Deep South, and Mike Henry as the long suffering and equally very dim Justice Junior. The latters' performance, while certainly not Shakespeare material, is exactly what is called for - bewildered and confused.Everyone who was anyone in the country music industry contributed to the soundtrack, including Jerry Reed once again recording the film's theme (a virtual carbon copy of East/West Bound and Down). Brenda Lee and Don Williams make cameos, as do Burt's buddies Joe Klecko, Terry Bradshaw and Messrs Dudley Remus and Hal Carter.All in all, disappointing and disowned by hardcore fans of the original, but definitely worth a look for Gleason's contributions. They are what keeps the film going when the rest of it is bogged down and turned into a melodrama of sorts, rather than sticking with the winning formula that made the original such a smash and a classic.

That being said, don't get me wrong, because the movie is still entertaining.The Bandit (playd by Burt Reynolds) has fallen on hard times with alcohol, but as a business opportunity comes around, The Snowman (played by Jerry Reed) and Frog (played by Sally Field) persuade The Bandit to sober and clean up and drive a 400.000 dollar cargo. But the police, led by notorious Sheriff Buford T. Justice (played by Jackie Gleason) is in hot pursuit.It was nice to see the original cast return for this 1980's sequel, that being Burt Reynolds, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Sally Field, Paul Williams, Pat McCormick, Mike Henry and the dog Fred. But Smokey and the Bandit II also brought the wonderful Dom DeLuise into the frame.Smokey and the Bandit II is entertaining enough for what it is, and it should be seen if you enjoyed the first movie. It does, however, suffer under the pressure of being a sequel.

We also see the return of the bride to be in the first movie as well a bride again, but the bandit comes a calling and off she goes leaving the same man as in the first film, Junior Justice. With Junior Justice you have good old Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T.Justice alongside him, and yet again for another time he is after the bandit, this time trying to deliver an elephant (Ran out of ideas quickly me thinks).It all plays out rather fast paced which is both it's biggest positive but also negative, the story is fairly frantic and not well thought out in parts and just a little bit shaky. It's good old fun don't get me wrong but the laughter isn't flowing and some of the things that happen are just downright stupid, by the end you feel almost like doing something dumb. The stunts are the best thing in the story and I won't doubt the movie on it's skill of keeping you engaged, but that doesn't mean it is good.Hal Needham directs OK but never well enough to save this from being average, his touch is both too cringe but also dampens some of the moments that could have had laughs. The writing is not well done and possibly one of the worst things about this, it just makes the story as mentioned more stupid and contains moments and characters that are just needlessly un-needed. What the film really needed to be even OK was just to have an injection of good writing and some more clinically funny bits to be the kind of alright movie I felt the first one was.Reynolds comes back not as good as before but still has a little bit of his style that he gives Bo Darville aka the Bandit and he gives a performance that I felt was good albeit not as funny as he was in the first. Jackie Gleason as the Sheriff is for me the funniest person in this in fact if anything he gets funnier in this movie than previous, the jokes are well suited to him and the funny relationship with his son is at times fun to see. Sally Field is the bride to be yet again who comes to the aid of the bandit and the snowman and she brings plain acting, I won't criticise her so harshly but she is far from OK, makes her scenes stale and also for some reason disappears for most of the second half of the movie then returns out of nowhere. I think all in all this was fun-ish, but not fun enough for me to kind of like it; it was more for me a kind of dislike and disappointing actually. That said I know for a fact fans of the first will enjoy this as it basically lifts off from where the first finished in a sort of way, it tries too hard to remake what made the first a smash and does create a so-so piece. So overall I wouldn't really recommend it but then again I wouldn't say don't try it, just don't watch it if your looking for a bit more smart entertainment, but sure if you want a quick watch that doesn't require much thought then this is perfect, but still mediocre.

This time, he is to transport a live elephant across the country in three days or less.Like the first movie, there is virtually no basic plot to this sequel, taking on the same formula of the high-speed car chase with Justice Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason) in pursuit of The Bandit. Gleason continued his hilarious portrayal of the Sheriff, inserting laugh-out-loud redneck humor where appropriate and continues to talk-down his slow-thinking son, Junior (Mike Henry). But, I thought the movie was less exciting than the original, as I thought the constant bickering between The Bandit and Carrie really dragged the film down, and Cledus (Jerry Reed) and Carrie's sudden concern over the elephant's welfare rather than winning the dare takes away the excitement and fuel of the overall plot.This sequel has its funny moments, mostly courtesy of Jackie Gleason, but it's not as exciting as the first movie.Grade C- "},{"Title":"Decent good ol' boy sequel","Date":"30 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Released in 1980, Smokey in the Bandit II is (naturally) the sequel to the good ol' boy hit Smokey and the Bandit from 1977. Burt Reynolds stars with Jerry Reed as Bandit and Cledus, two Southern truckers who take a gig hauling an elephant from Florida to Dallas. Sally Field co-stars as Carrie, aka Frog, a literal runaway bride (again) picked up by Bandit. The father of the groom, Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), ain't happy and goes on the pursuit. Mike Henry, Paul Williams and Pat McCormick are also on hand. Also, several of the champion Pittsburgh Steelers have cameos, like Terry Bradshaw, Mean Joe Greene and Joe Klecko.People tend not to like this sequel because Bandit starts out as a drunken bum and the movie's not as kinetic as the previous one. However, Bandit gets back into the swing of things and there are enough motorhead antics to please car chase aficionados. No, it's not as good as the first (which wasn't all that good in the first place), but I enjoy the elephant shenanigans and the subplot about nobly sacrificing an incredible amount of money for the welfare of an elephant and (maybe) her bambino. Moreover, I appreciate the warmhearted tone and redemptive subtheme.The female eye-candy is pretty much limited to Field, but there are a few peripheral cuties.The film runs 101 minutes and was shot mostly in Florida, but also Georgia (the race track) and southern Nevada, the latter of which they try to pass off as East Texas.

This time the movie has gone for a more all out comedy slapstick route, more along the lines of Needham's other movie 'The Cannonball Run', or dare I say, Disney's Herbie franchise.Once again the plot revolves around the Bandit and his partner the Snowman, transporting a cargo across the country as quickly as possible. This time its from Miami to Dallas, once again the challenge is set by Big Enos, once again there is a big monetary reward and lastly the cargo is an elephant (only thing that is different). Here lies the problem with this movie, its exactly the same sh*t as the first movie, exactly!! Once again the duo team up with Sally Field's character Frog, who has once again left Junior Justice at the altar, which naturally means Sheriff Buford T. Justice is back on their trail...again. The entire premise of the first movie is basically rebooted or remade here, accept the cargo is an elephant.I really couldn't believe my eyes as I was watching this (first time viewing), the plot simply retreads everything. When we find the Bandit he has become a drunk which adds a new dimension to the character, but that is quickly forgotten as the plot recaptures the same old vibe, but not in a good way. Frog is once again lured away from getting married to Junior, which begs the question why on earth is she still even wanting to marry this guy! I thought she was over him in the first movie. The fact that this leads to Buford Justice chasing the Bandit and co across the country yet again feels really really rehashed and boring.This movie seriously takes a nose dive in terms of dignity, talk about selling out and milking your original idea. The whole project just feels like its patting itself on the back whilst slapping product advertisement stickers all over itself. I mean lets look at the Bandits attire in this one, he's wearing a shiny red jacket with the words 'Bandit' and 'Trans Am' down the sleeves and across the back. Even the car has 'Bandit' on its paintwork which makes me wonder why really, it that really necessary? is the Bandit a product within this movies universe? Plus how the hell did they manage to afford a Pontiac Trans Am by chopping in that crappy old car?As the story unfolds more and more ridiculous things happen which make no sense and have clearly been chucked in to be funny, apparently. Enter Dom Deluise, a Needham regular, a regular movie partner of Reynolds and a regular slapstick comedian of the time. If you ever needed your movie to be bolstered with in your face comedy then Deluise was your man, and sure enough he is on good form here as expected. The only problem is his character has obviously been jammed in just to extract the best from Deluise and nothing more, the character is a throwaway job. The fact the Bandit and co take him along on their adventure makes no sense either because they could of dropped him off anywhere, he's obviously there to salvage the movie. Now lets talk about the cargo, the elephant. Yes that's right, they stuff a living creature into the trailer of a big rig, no light, no food, no water and most importantly no air! Couldn't help but wonder if this would have been allowed these days, of course its not real but we do actually see the animal climb into the trailer. The point is its the whole idea of doing it, and the way the characters think its perfectly OK, although admittedly they do look after the animal much better later on. Gotta ask why a Republican party would need an elephant, yeah sure its your mascot but you really need a real one?!The whole thing is so drab, just watching Buford chase the Bandit all over again, doing the same spiel but without any grown-up edge to it. Everything is so childish, the chases are almost like Benny Hill sequences, the carnage is tame and has this cartoon-esque quality to it, there is never any real threat or danger etc...because its all so light-hearted. In the first movie it felt relatively realistic, like it could happen, here its all over the top and off the wall, which in- turn takes away any proper enjoyment. Perfect example being the big money sequence where the Snowman and all his big rig buddies take on an entire squadron of smokies. Now this is the sequence which I refer to as (Disney's) 'The Love Bug' sequence, this is what I meant at the start of this review. The whole thing is pretty cringeworthy and virtually destroys any self respect this movie had.I was seriously disappointed with this sequel, never knew it was such a rehash...or reboot basically! Its exactly the same as the first movie with minor alterations, watered and dumbed down incredibly. There isn't even any car or truck porn to get excited about, they have completely jettisoned that idea leaving only the famous black Trans Am. I can't count all the big rigs in the Love Bug sequence simply because it was so crap and infantile, clearly not about the trucks. Do yourself a favour and don't bother with this shockingly woeful attempt at a sequel.3/10 "},{"Title":"The scenes involving Gleason & Henry were great, but everything else was pretty bad","Date":"23 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Having seen the first film I only had one real expectation with this film and that was quite simply 'dumb fun'. Well all I can say is that there was plenty of dumb and not enough fun and that's the big problem with this film.The premise of transporting an elephant from Florida to Texas already had me worried as I felt that this plot line overstepped the fine line between being a fun premise and being a dumb premise and sadly that's exactly what happened; far too much time was spent on the protagonists fussing over the elephant and bonding with it was just dumb and not particularly funny. I knew I was really in trouble when I realised the best they could do from this was to get the elephant to form an emotional attachment to the Bandit - simply put it wasn't funny and didn't work.On a lesser note I found the Bandit's transition from his care-free persona in the first film to him being a depressed alcoholic at the start of this film(all because he misses Carrie or 'Frog') to be a bit too much of a stretch in credibility. I just found it hard to believe that he'd go to pieces like that.The biggest problem this film has is that for the most part it quite simply lacks fun; the best thing about the first film is that it felt like one long car chase, it was exciting and fun. Sure it was dumb, but it always leaves a big smile on my face every time I watch it. This didn't. As mentioned, the transportation of an animal gave it an emotional core that it simply didn't need and it suffers badly as a result.Thank goodness then for Gleason & Henry who do at least try to salvage something from this wreckage; their interplay was superb as it was in the first film and they both share the best scenes in the film. In fact, I don't remember there being one scene in this film involving Gleason & Henry that wasn't funny.The demolition derby style finale was a little over the top and embarrassing, but at least it brought some much needed excitement to the table. The somewhat sugar coated ending didn't leave a particularly good taste in my mouth and it did make me wonder at times if the writers kept forgetting what type of film they're supposed to be making.This is a pretty poor film that is ultimately saved by the excellent performances by Gleason & Henry. Although there's a lot of tedium in this film, the scenes involving Gleason & Henry are so good that it actually makes it worth your while sitting through all the weaker aspects.

But this movie opens with the gang scattered and the actors seem to be playing cartoon versions of their characters. None of the charm or humor of the first movie is present this time around. It just lumbers from one contrived gag to another, and I often wished the movie would go somewhere. Anywhere. I've seen bad sequels, but I don't think I've seen one that squanders the promise of the original so badly. It's like the first movie never happened.

With part 2, we are left with a lazy, low-speed retread that amounts to little more than spotting cameos by high profile country singers and athletes. There are some huge stunts here, as you would expect, but in between them we are treated to nothing but boredom. Much of the plot deals with Reynolds, Reid, and Field trying to transport a pregnant elephant across the country in order to make several hundred thousand dollars.

Maybe that makes for interesting viewing if you are a kid (I loved this movie as a child), but now it seems so anti-climatic. The only person who seems to want to keep this story moving is Reynolds, who has to know this script is a loser and needs more action. The only bright spot is the return of Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Once again he sets out to track Reynolds down as Field has left his son at the altar to join the Bandit in another wild escapade. As funny as Gleason is in his multiple roles, when you watch this movie on basic cable, you miss most of his lines. Since most of them include a sum bitch or PG rated slur, someone apparently went back and re-dubbed most of his dialog for the small screen.

They drive really fast, blah, blah, blah. Pick up the crate holding the animal, blah, blah, blah. They pick up the doc and boom, I fell asleep from the boring story. I woke up at the ending of the semi slash police car chicken race. The only real points this film gets is thanks to the great Jackie Gleason, Rest In Peace. Now if you've enjoyed the original film, you may not enjoy this film. I didn't, I enjoyed Part 3 more than this! Make your your choice wisely, this film is pretty lame.

Like the 'Cannonball' movies, it has a roll call of notables (for its time) but plays like a fraternity house home movie that's amusing only to the people who appeared in it.  Former pro football player Terry Bradshaw is featured prominently and is a perfect fit for this film.  A harum-scarum comic chase, but without any thrills or laughs, the entire movie falls in lockstep with Bradshaw's hootin' and hollerin' country-fried yahoo persona.  You have much better things to do with your time than this.  This movie is two hours out of your life that you will never have back again.  This movie will leave skidmarks on your TV screen and I don't mean from car tires.

About the only good thing that I can say about this film is that it wasn't boring.  In fact, it seemed like I had only been watching for half an hour when the final credits rolled.  Unfortunately, this only proves that the plot is INCREDIBLY slight, and that a fun cast cannot make up for a script that seemed like it was about two pages long.

The reason is I couldn't think of anything of value to say, be it good or bad. My mind was blank as I sat here. I was trying to think, but nothing happened (Thanks, Curley) What possessed anyone to (re)make a movie of this caliber? Caliber as in Smokey and the Bandit being a 10 gage shotgun and this farce being a bb gun. What were they thinking? We expected to see the clam chowder run and got a knocked-up elephant. Grim acting, weak plot line, painful jokes all added up to this movie. When I'm channel-surfing and I see Smokey and the Bandit on, I always (to the annoyance of my wife) stop and watch it. When SatBII is on, I watch it out of curiosity. Curious as in watching old dried paint peeling off a wall.(did the writers eat paint chips as children?) As far as a chase movie centered around the health and well being of an elephant...save it. Next time call a Vet!

It was more heartwarming, but less in your face to Gleason's character. Had they managed to attain the same comedic level, while raising the sugar factor, this would have topped the first one.Our favorite fugitives from justice race the clock, and Mother Nature, to deliver their latest specialized load.This was quite fun, but did not manage to meet the quality of entertainment we received from the original, not that the original was a masterpiece, or anything.I enjoy it, but not as much as I did the first. It's more like the Rom/Com version of Smokey and the Bandit than a continuation of any story, though they did write this as a continuation at least among the characters.It rates a 4.6/10 from...the Fiend .

Consider the works of Nigel Kneale where we see alien invasions , our suspension of disbelief is kept in check so we sense mortal danger in the scenario . Classic DOCTOR WHO shares this conviction , check out the early stories where the Tardis goes anywhere in time or space in a totally fantastical way but is written and played in such a way we can actually believe what is happening . It's the same with LORD OF THE RINGS where thousands of years ago mythical creatures fought for the future of middle Earth . Jackson's vision of the trilogy is historical drama rather than fantasy hence even the most cynical viewer like myself can buy into the story The problem with SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT 2 is that it's very difficult to believe in the characters and the situations involved . Smokey and his cronies come across an elephant and transport it across the USA pursued by a red neck sheriff . This premise might have had some potential ( Though it would never have been a classic ) but what let's it all collapse is the way the characters are written and played with Jackie Gleason especially putting in a very poor performance as someone who has panic attacks when the word  Bandit  is mentioned . There's plenty of unconvincing set pieces such as the Bandit goading Sheriff Justice into showing him his sharp shooting and this is why the movie fails as entertainment .

And the best part is the car. Burt Renolds drives the coolest Affordable American car ever. The 1981 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo is still the baddest Amerian Muscle Car of all time and you get to see it action for 2 hours. The V8 356 horse power, 5.6 litter engine sports car does some funny stuff during this movie. I think the plot is very cool - bootleg beer over the state line without getting caught by the cops! Movie plots don't get any better than that. It you've ever drank beer, and driving a T-Top Trans Am (not at the same time of course), then you will love this funny movie.

In the first movie Cletus drove a Kenworth, in part 2, he drives The GMC GENERAL! Now that's my favorite truck. With a movie with all the trucks is a major keeper in my book. I think it's where I got the idea of creating Whitlockville. Especially the scene where Cletus' crew makes a bridge of semis for The Bandit and him to cross. YAAAAAHHOOOO!!! is what The Bandit shout after he crossed the Bridge. As for that Neanderthal Sheriff Buford T. Justice(The legendary Jackie Gleason) he should have been faster than that. His family and the County and Mounted Mounties didn't stand a chance against all those trucks! The Sheriff had his car turned over by Mean Joe Green, his badge crushed by a trucker who I won't bother upsetting and when his bone headed son forgot to load his gun, Buford should have shot his butt out right. With the elephant and baby in tow, the question is what's next, Bandit? Man, this movie was just as funny as the first, and it was my better favorite as well. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.

After all they work hard, too. And another thing, had the Snowman not stopped to feed himself (put some groceries down his neck) and Fred, they wouldn't have went into that café and eventually came out and ran over all those motorcycles. That was about one of the lamest bike gangs I've seen next to the Black Widows in Every Which Way But Loose.
