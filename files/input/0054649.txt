It's rather simple, with the fanciest effects being the movement of the toy soldiers, which was ahead of its time, but it's a true case of simple is beautiful. It's a fantastic movie for those who just wish to sit back, and laugh with the family, and have an adventure in fantasy land. The play is still being put on around the world, and this, to me, is just the best captured version. There's really something for everyone - Ray Bolger ( who looked really spectacular, very handsome in his role as Barnaby), Annette (who is always charming for being the sweetheart we all know), Tommy Sands as the daring hero, and the team of Henrey Calvin and Gene Sheldon, along with the forever amusing Ed Wynn. This movie turns out more of a comedy, and the adventures that encompass Mary and Tom Piper, when crossed by Barnaby, double crossed by Gonzorgo and Rodrigo are hilarious. This is primarily a Christmas movie, but it's set so you can watch it anytime of the year - and so you should! I still cannot get over Ray bolger as a villian....he does a lovely job, and looks terrific, but if you only know him as the scarecrow, you'll especially need to see this! He makes the statement relavent that he is very, very, very versatile, and one of our greatest entertainment treasures.

Most of the production and the special effects in the finale are very good, and the adaptation of the operetta score is fine, but the balky direction has no pizazz, no snap. Worse, the scowling children make exclamations in unison, Tommy Sands is excruciatingly hammy in drag as an old gypsy woman, and the Laurel and Hardy-inspired slapstick routines feel out of place.

It doesn't rank up with the one that Laurel&Hardy did in the Thirties. For one thing the Victor Herbert score was cut, but not added to. Secondly Stan and Ollie were the center of things even though they are supporting characters. That in itself made their March Of The Wooden Soldiers memorable.Still this version that Disney did featured several of his stable of young stars like Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands as the young lovers of Toyland who want to wed. But evil Barnaby reprised in this version by Ray Bolger is going to put a stop to that. He's got designs on Annette's virtue and more important on the inheritance he knows she will get upon her wedding day. Bolger is having a great old time hamming it up as Barnaby.Stan and Ollie are saluted by Disney with Gene Sheldon and Henry Calvin, fresh from the Zorro series. They're funny, but are clearly relegated to supporting players as Bolger's inept stooges. As Stan Laurel was still alive when Babes In Toyland was in the theaters, I've often wondered what he thought of Sheldon and Calvin.Tommy Kirk who was barely out of his teens got a real treat to work with one of the great funny men of all time. Babes In Toyland is a great example for those of us to see the zany humor in the character of Ed Wynn as the Toymaker with Kirk as his assistant. The two of them work very well together.Even Tommy Sands gets into the humor of things when he dons an outrageous gypsy drag persona to foil one of Bolger's schemes. A scheme that goes awry when Calvin and Sheldon don't precisely obey orders. You just can't get good help, even in Toyland.I even think Victor Herbert would have approved of the way his numbers were done though he probably would not like the Disney interpolations that were made. He was a stickler for such things in his life.Viewing March Of The Wooden Soldiers back to back with Babes In Toyland doesn't make this version look inferior by any means.

Did you ever want to see the Wicked Witch of the West get her hands on those ruby slippers and shove Dorothy inside the crystal ball so she would be forced to watch the witch tap dance for eternity? Did you want the Baroness in The Sound of Music to throw Maria back to the convent and marry Captain Von Trapp? Well, put yourself through nearly two hours of torture with this second film version of the 1903 Victor Herbert operetta and see if you can escape it without hoping that Barnaby wins, forcing Annette Funnicello's Mary to marry him, then teach her some acting lessons before realizing his mistake and sending her back to Tommy Sands.Decently made in 1934 by MGM, this color version of the operetta is about as fun as a dental visit. Overly sweet and gooey, this is as nauseatingly irritating as Disney films could get. Even in their later musicals, there was an adult element that older audiences could enjoy, and by modern standards, I don't even think pre-teens could get into this film without praying for a dental emergency to take them away from it. From the moment that Mother Goose comes out with her introduction, you want to see her plucked, stuffed and cooked, and with one of the most obnoxious production numbers to open a musical, if your kids don't look at you and say, What is this crap?, they deserve all the sweets they can handle to try and get through the rest of it.While there are some magical moments (The Forest of No Return, March of the Wooden Soldiers), they are few and far between and surrounded in molasses and honey that can make the most innocent of movie viewers cringe. Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon are a poor imitation of Laurel and Hardy, their comic relief dated vaudeville schtick, even by 1960's standards, especially with the banal Slowly He Sank To The Bottom of the Sea. Ed Wynn does provide some amusement as the toymaker, but it is Ray Bolger's mustache twirling Snidely Whiplash style villain that seems to be having the most fun. Bolger shows off his dancing talents which were still energetic more than 20 years after The Wizard of Oz, giving spark to Castle in Spain. A young Ann Jillian is a vibrant force as Bo Peep, but I much prefer her in sultry roles like Mae West.Babes in Toyland does not seem like the type of show that can be revived, and even by 1960's standards, it seems that 50+ year old songs like I Can't Do The Sum and Go To Sleep were best left in the old trunks of old songs that express one era but are better left unexpressed in others. Sometimes the overly cuteness of Disney films just seemed out of step with the turbulent 1960's even if they were also delivering a lot of magic to children of that era like me with classics like Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks.

It use to be on TV when I was a kid...but not anymore. I was fortunate to buy it on DVD though. The film is also based on an operetta by Victor Herbert, with new lyrics by Mel Leven and of course I thought it's a great soundtrack.In the film, Annette Funicello plays Mary Quite-Contrary and Tommy Sands plays Mary's fiancée Tom Piper, the Piper's son. As Mary and Tom's wedding approaches, evil schemer Barnaby (The Wizard of OZ's Ray Bolger) hatches a plot to drown Tom, and steal Mary's sheep in an effort to get her to marry him...for the money she will inherit. But unfortunately for Barnaby, the two henchmen he had order to kill Tom, kidnap him instead and sell him to a band of gypsies...for more money of course, since they're being payed by Barnaby to get rid of Tom.But when Mary discovers Tom is alive, the couple had a happy reunion. But when the two went back to Mary's cottage, the children in Marys' care, Wee Willie Winkie, Little Boy Blue and Little Bo Peep had gone to look for the sheep in the Forest of No Return. The two found the children, but they spend the night in the forest. In the morning, the band were captured by the trees of the forest and escorted to Toyland to see the Toymaker. That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.Overall, this film's a wonderful Disney production...too bad it had a disappointing box office performance.

That version is the best of the ones I've seen but this one isn't without some positives. For starters, it's a beautiful-looking film with great sets, props, and costumes. That goose is creepy, though. It's a movie full of bright vivid colors that pop out at you. The cast is good, with Tommy Sands and a stunning Annette Funicello as likable (if dull) leads. Ray Bolger has fun as the villain Barnaby. Gene Sheldon and Henry Calvin, playing Barnaby's henchmen, are obviously impersonating Laurel and Hardy, and having a good time doing so. Ed Wynn is a scene stealer as the Toymaker. Disney legend Tommy Kirk plays his assistant and seems to be having fun. Director Jack Donohue does a respectable job bringing Toyland and its Mother Goose characters to life on the screen. But somehow the whole thing just doesn't click the way it should. You get the feeling from the start that the movie is trying way too hard. There are songs on top of songs and none of them are particularly strong. Most are terribly corny. There are interesting things about the film (particularly the visuals) so it's not a complete dud. It helps to avoid comparisons to the superior 1934 version. If you're a fan of the story or a Disney buff, by all means give it a shot. Also if you're a parent of a young child perhaps they'll like it. Everyone else go in with lowered expectations.

Frank Baum's world of Oz, I heard that while experimenting with the possibility of doing a live-action musical film featuring its characters in the late 1950s, this film was what he ultimately made instead. Upon seeing the clips from Babes in Toyland that they had included in it, as a long-time Disney fan I thought Hey, why have I never heard of this before. So, I quickly went out and bought the movie and within just minutes of sitting down to watch it, I saw exactly why I'd never heard of it before.Throughout the entire film, you get the feeling that the major concern of everyone involved in the production was how it looked because it appears that they spent more time on that than anything else, but there are even times where that isn't very good.It's springtime in Mother Goose Village and sweethearts Tom Piper and Mary Contrary (Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello) have named their wedding day. However, unbeknownst to Mary, she will inherit a fortune upon getting married (from whom we are never told) that the miserly Barnaby (Ray Bolger) wants for himself. So, he instructs his two bumbling henchmen (Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon) to kill Tom. However, the two decide that they want a little extra money, so after kidnapping him, they sell him to some gypsies that eventually return him to his beloved. However, all is not yet well as Mary's five children...wait no, they can't be her children, she's too young...brothers and sisters...wait no, she wouldn't be left to take care of them by herself... foster children...wait no, how does a 25-something-year-old woman get those...ah, forget it! Anyway, five children go wandering into The Forest of No Return and Tom and Mary go to try and retrieve them. However, some menacing-looking singing trees who work for a neighbouring toymaker, played by Ed Wynn (why?) send them off to his workshop where they agree to help him make toys because he has only one assistant (again, why?)So, as you can tell from that summary, there are some major plot holes, but that is not the film's only shortcoming. Many of the characters are so underdeveloped that as you watch, you find yourself very uninvested in what is happening to them. Mary only takes a stand once in the climax of the film. The rest of her screen time is spent either crying, being confused or singing dull romantic duets with her lover. Speaking of Tom, he does get a delightfully goofy number in which he re-enters the town dressed in gypsy drag, but other than that, we see nothing of his personality, other than the fact that he's suave and handsome. As for the kids, the fact that they are what they are is all we know about them.Barnaby is always fun to watch as he twirls his cape and tap dances his way through his scenes, but the problem is that by doing so, he does not present himself as much of a threat when he's supposed to be the main villain of the piece. His two henchmen get a giggle here and there, but not too often. The Toymaker should be really enjoyable, considering who plays him, but he comes across as extremely unlikeable, because he always insists on doing everything himself, making a huge mess in the process. Although, as previously stated there is a lot of creativity to be seen in this movie. The various storybook-like houses featured herein look really imaginative, as do the costumes and several of the effects look very convincing. However, there are exceptions to that statement, as there are times where the visual elements look like they could have been worked on a little more and other effects look really fake. For example there is a scene where one of the henchmen magically disappears underneath a puddle but the movements of the stop-motion toy soldiers used in the climax look extremely choppy. As for the music, Babes in Toyland's numbers range from extremely catchy (Castle In Spain, I Can't Do the Sum) to totally bland and/or forgettable (Just a Toy, Toyland.) On a final note, the choreography looks as though it were lazily thought out, what with the dancers repeatedly jumping from left to right and vice versa.All that said, I feel profuse pity for this film as it had capable actors, great visuals, a previously wildly successful operetta to adapt itself from...all the ingredients that could have made it a masterpiece. Sadly though, in the end my final verdict is watch only if you're a hardcore Disney fan like me.

The direction is at times lacking in pizazz and comes across as stodgy, making the film drag a bit in the less eventful parts. The story is rather thin, sometimes uneventful which bogs the pace down(but this is not in the entire film), and while Tommy Sands does have moments where he shines like in his gypsy drag scene at other points he's dull. Babes in Toyland looks colourful and the production values are simple and very pretty. Victor Herbert's score is a very pleasant one, it's not one of his greatest scores but it has songs that are both melodious and catchy. The choreography is light-on-its-feet and enough to tap the toes, so there is some liveliness to be had. The story is nothing really special, but there is a wonderful weirdness and wondrous fantasy atmosphere. That can especially be seen in the March of the Wooden Toy Soldiers sequence, which is the prime example of where you can find the film's clever special effects. There are some nice funny moments, and some slapstick(from personal perspective it wasn't that misplaced though it did have a Laurel and Hardy feel) and a lot of heart-warming charm. Don't expect fully developed characters, particularly with Tom and Mary, but they're hardly shallow either, the most colourful of them are Barnaby and the Toymaker. The performances are entertaining. Annette Funicello is a beauty and gives a charming performance, Ann Jillian doesn't have much to do but shows off her beautiful singing voice and child stars Kevin Cocoran and Tommy Kirk pop up too and are similarly appealing. The best of the lot go to Ed Wynn and particularly Ray Bolger. Wynn is both zany and warm-hearted, some of the film's most entertaining moments are with him. With Bolger, when you think of him you don't usually think of him playing a villain, but he does here and is delightfully wicked and seems to be having fun without over-compensating. In conclusion, as far as Disney live-action musicals Babes in Toyland is not as good as Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks and lacks both films' magic, but it is still a nice fun film that shouldn't demand too much. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Disappointing family musical","Date":"12 March 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Walt Disney had great hopes for Babes In Toyland, releasing it during the lucrative Christmas holiday season. But the critical reaction was just so-so, and the box office take, while not disastrous, was disappointing. Watching the movie today, it's pretty easy to figure out why there wasn't much enthusiasm for the movie. Its biggest flaw is that there is almost nothing done to make the main characters of Tom and Mary into REAL characters - we learn next to nothing about them, and Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello give performances that show their helplessness with their thin characters. Somewhat better is the character of Barnaby - he's given a lot of screen time and Ray Bolger gives a decent performance. Bolger gives some spark in his scenes, but additional problems with the movie defeat his enthusiasm. The songs, while not awful, are extremely unmemorable. Most of the sets come across as extremely stagebound and theatrical and feel phony. Is there anything else in this movie that might attract some viewers? Well, Ed Wynn fans might be charmed by his scenes as the toymaker. And the climax does have some stop-motion animation that might interest fans of the medium. But even these people might turn off their televisions before these moments come because the movie is for the most part so bland. I think even kids will be bored.

I loved the album as a child, but as the movie started, I realized the album featured re-recordings (probably to save money paying for Annette and Tommy). Well, the studio singers were BETTER than the performers in the film.This is a movie trying to figure out what to be... it felt like the practice session full of mistakes that they then corrected by the time Mary Poppins came around. Instead of Dick Van Dyke dancing with the penguins, you get Ray Bolger plodding through an overlong Pasodoble with a crudely fashioned flower fountain. Part teen romance beach blanket movie, part vaudeville slapstick, part fantasy, with none of the parts interfacing well.Don't get me wrong, I still found the emotional attachment I had to the music, got teary hearing the songs again, and seeing the characters that the album illustrations were based on, but I also could view the film with an adult critical eye and see that it was a mess.One thing that always perplexes me is that almost all the reviews for this film mention that it is excellent family fare. Of course, no violence or swearing , but the gender stereotyping is so extreme (even for Disney), that my 11 year old daughter was in shock.-Mary, who is done up in corsets through the whole film- 1) sings a song about how incompetent she is at math and finances. 2) is crooned to that she is just a toy by her fiancé, who then ties a ribbon around her and pulls her around (oh look, now she's on a leash my daughter laughed) 3) cringes behind a table during a fight to the death between miniaturized Tom and Barnaby, when she is the only full sized person in the room, and could have easily flicked the villain away with a finger. (Yes, I know that would destroy the tension of the climax, but they make such a ridiculous show of her terror that it bears mention.) 4) meanwhile, on the production line in the toymaker's factory, the boys only touch the cars and the girls only touch the dolls.Really people, are these the messages you want planted in the heads of your 4 year old daughters? We know this stuff is old and campy, but your little girls don't.The Laurel and Hardy wannabes are blatant and inferior. Almost as if the casting agent went out of their way to keep reminding you how much better Stan and Ollie are.Ed Wynne is fabulous as the toymaker, and his scenes, especially stalling during the wedding ceremony, are the highlight of the film. The sets and costumes are cheesy but lush and colorful, the dance and musical numbers are fairly standard for the time, and the bits of Victor Herbert that managed to survive provide some lovely lilting melodies, but overall, this film is a bit of a train wreck.

It's educational value? It teaches kids about more refined subjects like musical operetta and cultural history rather than what is the latest blow em' up and kill your neighbor video game trend. The music has history rather than flash in the pan theatrics of a current trend (kids raised on this are more likely to be eclectic and informed in their musical taste than kids who stick only to the latest trends)you can tell I am not big on trends.

This movie can inspire small children along those lines. Plus it is'nt just a fuddy duddy film, it's very populist and quaintly oddball, which is fun.The film is also,like most classic Disney,Very safe, and family friendly(I don't even think there is any cigar smoking here which could be common in older kiddie flicks). Annette Funnicello is also a very clean,safe popular icon image for kids to like, unlike many of the juvenile role models they have today who are constantly getting into trouble(I mean,God,who wants to explain the reckless behavior of a Lindsey,Hilary or a Miley to their kids).But alas,fans of this film,we are alone and out-numbered.Even the Disney studio does'nt care enough to enhance and restore this beautiful gem(still looks great nonetheless).The Hal Roach comedy is incredible and wonderful, but it gets all the accolades and acclaim.This film deserves better treatment. The Hal Roach film is essentially a comedy. Disney's film is what Victor Herbert intended. An operetta.I see more and more people are speaking up on behalf of this much neglected film classic. Keep up the good work. Maybe we can inspire a movement and fight all the boogeyman scrooges who hate this adorable little treasure.God Bless.

I have to say that this is probably my ALL-TIME FAVORITE movie! Every time I would watch it as a little kid, I seemed to always be mesmerized. We always checked it out from the library. It was probably at our house more often than all of the other library patrons combined! My older sisters loved it and so did my younger brother. I grew up on this movie, it gave me expectations on how a movie should make you feel. Every time I watched it, I would sit on the couch and not get up until the movie had finished, at that moment, nothing was more important than Babes in Toyland. My mother promised to get the movie for me for my birthday a few years ago, but by the time she went to go buy it, they had already sold out of it. I was so disappointed, but now that I am going to be able to get it off the net, I am so overjoyed, I can't even put it into words!

The special effects are also for today stunning.  The march of the wooden soldiers is a -must see-sequence.Perhaps not a masterpiece but indeed an average cult movie.P.S.

Too much of the movie revolves around Ray Bolger's burlesque villain and his henchmen. (One's skinny and one's fat - but they're a poor substitute for the real Laurel and Hardy, who'd done their own version of Babes in Toyland in 1934.) The second half is better - when the characters arrive in Toyland, with Ed Wynn as a bumbling Toymaker and Tommy Kirk his helper. The super-lightweight plot is a weakness and a strength, with twists that are unpredictable and occasionally odd. The movie culminates with a bizarre battle where the villain is attacked by animated toys...Some of the dialog rhymes, but no one seems enthusiastic about it. Annette isn't particularly winning in this one, and even the dancing is hard to see, because the dancers' legs are covered by long storybook dresses. (And bad lighting, casting a few extra shadows.) On the plus side Tommy Sands has a great voice, and the Disney chorus sings lush harmonies. And young Ann Jillian, as Bo-Peep, sings her few lines wonderfully...

But, now a trained musician, I reviewed it not too long ago and they get all the music wrong, which is a shame.  I remember the number I Can't Do That Sum from elementary school music instruction, can still sing it backwards and forwards, and am depressed as to how they botched it in this movie.First, they changed the classic words without any apparent motivation.  Then, operettas need crisp, serious singers.  Someone like Funicello who can barely carry a tune after serious direction does not belong in this context.  The style for a number in the Mickey Mouse Show won't do for any serious song, whether classical or show tune. Victor Herbert deserved better.   Musicals that got it right (aside from the great classics)?  Pennies from Heaven, and one I've been looking for for a quite a while, Newsies.  You put a voice where a voice should be.

I was wrong. There is also this Disney atrocity to contend with.When Victor Herbert produced his 'Babes in Toyland' on Broadway in 1903, it followed on the steps of the preceding stage extravaganza, 'The Wizard of Oz', which it outdid in magnificence, costliness (its shipwreck scene outdid 'The Wizard's cyclone, its Toyland outdid the other's Emerald City, etc.), imagination and original melodies. It was eventually followed by another Victor Herbert Christmas spectacle, 'Little Nemo in Slumberland' (1908), which surpassed them all in spectacular stage effects, number of participants and box office. This was a magic time when sentimental Irish Catholic New-Yorkers genuinely believed that when they went to heaven, they would hear Victor Herbert's tunes sung by angel choirs until the end of time.Unfortunately, all of Herbert's operettas would have been totally forgotten today if it hadn't been for the awful Hollywood Laurel and Hardy vehicle of the thirties (Babes in Toyland, 1934, a.k.a. Laurel and Hardy in Toyland, March of the Wooden Soldiers, Revenge Is Sweet and Wooden Soldiers), which preserved its spirit of pantomime and most of its storyline but sacrificed its music by relegating the whole score (except for five songs) to a very scratchy and noisy background on the soundtrack.Then came Disney. This film (available on DVD) is nothing more than an elaborate episode of the Mickey Mouse Club. The story has been changed around for no reason the only remaining common element through all the different versions is that there is a villain in Mother Goose Land named Barnaby Barnacle, who wears a tall black top hat and a long moustache, has two funny acolytes in crime and is out to prevent a happy ending for the other younger cast members. The original songs have been simplified, modernized, 'disneyfied', 'cutified', 'Lawrence-Welked' and bowdlerized almost out of existence, probably because they would have been considered too 'difficult' for the intended nose-picking kiddie audience. This is very ironic since it contributed to 'Babes' downfall at the box office and served as a lesson to Disney who did everything in his power, subsequently, with 'Mary Poppins' to provide a great score, first-class singers, great orchestration, and a nostalgic feel closer to traditional turn-of-the century entertainments.The only reason I am not harsher on Disney's story treatment is that it was followed in 1986 by an even worse live action treacly TV version and in 1997 by the definitely dismal animated one (MGM).'I Can't Do the Sum', whose main musical idea was that a group of schoolchildren, perplexed by a mathematical problem verging on the absurd, would punctuate their singing by scratching their chalk rhythmically on their chalkboards is now without chalkboard sounds - and logic. The forest lullaby is without its mystery and comfort. The title song, the very inspiring 'Toyland', is not even given a proper (choral) rendition but is instead screeched by a group of untalented children walking through the forest as if on their way to the washrooms of an amusement park to regurgitate their candy floss.Even 'The March of the Wooden Soldiers' (which has managed to survive on its own as a beloved orchestral Christmas favourite in America and a Boston Pops staple) is not even given the dignity of a proper Christian burial but truncated and drowned under a cacophony of sound effects and pie-in-the-face-type slapstick.There is nothing to salvage this mess, not even the wholehearted effort of its cast, with a special tip of the hat to Tommy Sands in a Gypsy scene (in drag) somewhat reminiscent of Stanley Donen's 'The Pirate' (1948).The only way to hear Victor Herbert's original score today - along with Glen MacDonough's original lyrics - is to hunt for a 2002 Universal CD reprising a 1944 mono studio recording of 11 of the original numbers (still heavily truncated) and the vinyl Readers' Digest 'Treasury of Operettas' 9-LP boxset, which contains 8 numbers, in very impressive 'Cyclophonic' stereo. Conductor Keith Brion also came out with a CD of extensive dreamy orchestral extracts from this operetta (including ballets and scene changes and an extended Overture). There doesn't seem to exist a recording of the entire score which comprises, apparently, dozens of different numbers.

This a fun enjoyable musical with some wonderful songs wonderful over-the-top hammy acting a wonderful storyline wonderful bright colours and wonderful dancing!

I thought it would be a nice colorful adaptation (without digital color enhancement) of the 1934 March of the Wooden Soldiers, but the only similarities are the songs when Little Bo Peep loses her sheep and when the soldiers come marching out, but that is it. Barnaby is hardly a frightening character (Ray Bolger gives nothing short of a comedic performance of this villain, but that is notably his style - you would not expect anything different from this extraordinary talented man.)There is far too much singing in this movie and it is very difficult to follow what the plot is (you have to listen closely to the words in the songs). It borders on a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, but they are by far a million times better and much more enjoyable as the musical numbers flow with ease.If anything, it is nice to see Annette Funicello and Tommy Kirk as they have graduated from the Mickey Mouse Club and doing the transition into adulthood. Annette's voice has finally matured from the childlike voice she had during her Mickey days.Thankfully, for DVD, I was able to fast-forward through all of the musical numbers because they grew tiresome quickly (after a few seconds)! Do yourself a favor and save the $4.00 it would cost to rent it, that is if you can find it anywhere. Now I know why it has been discontinued by so many video/DVD stores at this point.
