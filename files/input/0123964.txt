The movie then flashes back to 1932 to begin telling their story, and continues as they age in prison in Mississippi.They were petty criminals but were sentenced to life in prison for a murder they did not commit.  However, being black in 1930s Mississippi did them no favors.  The story that unfolds is irreverent and funny and has enough twists along the way to keep things very interesting.I can't understand why the average rating of this movie is below 6.  I give it 8 of 10 for its overall entertainment value, plus a few life's little lessons thrown in. I think it is one of Eddie Murphy's best movies.

Two adjectives that I have not been able to use for an Eddie Murphy film for a long time.With a story line as good as this one, it was up to Eddie to see how he could develop it. If this film had a flaw, I think this was it. I believe had Mr Murphy decided to look really deeply into the role of Rayford Gibson, it could have been a possible Oscar role for him.There are no doubts regarding Eddie Murphy's acting ability, yet sometimes I think he sacrifices the script and his role for a cheap laugh when it's not really necessary. It is possible that he is caught up in his own 'identity creation' of Eddie Murphy Comedy first, drama...maybe not!That said, Eddie Murphy and his worthy partner, Martin Lawrence successfully produce a comedy worth watching. I just hope that Eddie Murphy continues in this same vein. Please no more films like Beverly Hills Flop 3 and Holy Man!Finally, a general point, which needs to be addressed, is that it is so strange how comedy films with far more substance, fail to do well financially. Moreover, there are films which fall short in quality, that can generate $100M+ for substandard, regurgitated, comedy. Life which is struggling to reach the $65M mark falls into the former category. Austin Powers The Spy who Shagged Me and Big Daddy definitely fall in the latter. The mind boggles!Anyway, for those who have not seen Life, go and see, you won't regret watching it.

Once you let that expectation go, this is a great movie!  It succeeds as a drama with comic tone.  There have been some great ones that do this, and we mistakenly classify them as comedies.  For example, M*A*S*H, Mr. Roberts, It's a Wonderful Life.  These are pictures that provide comic overtones to people struggling to get through a very serious and overwhelming event war, contemplated suicide, and in the case of Life, life imprisonment.I was surprised at how good Murphy is in this flick.Not one of my favorites, he convinces as he ages and grows under the burden his character carries, that of an entire life stolen from him.  And he survives with a certain dignity.  Lawrence is almost as good, but he does labor a bit with the dramatic parts, seeming a bit uncomfortable shedding his comic bent.  Note that when these characters are shown as old men, Murphy actually becomes an old man, Lawrence is still a young man in oldster's make-up. Let's not overlook an interesting small role expertly understated by Ned Beatty, and the charm of Bokeem Woodbine as Can't Get Right. Life is well-mounted and the sets are as convincing as any I've seen. Comedies are rarely as dirty and sweaty as this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this picture, realizing early on that it was a very serious movie wrongly hyped as a comedy.

It's a practice as old as time in Hollywood.  Most of these movies fail miserably.You leave the theater thinking `It was funny enough, why couldn't it just stay silly?'  My friends, I'm with you on every page. It's a slippery slope to juggle the two genres.`Life' is the millionth attempt at warm-hearted comedy. It tries to make you pee your pants with its jokes, and yet slap your emotions around with the drama.  And damn the odds, it fits like a glove. `Life' is also a film that defies much criticism.  You either love stars Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, or you don't.  I'm in the first category.  As the main characters, the two comedians prove just how valuable they are.  Murphy is coming off a uniquely horrific year. `Dr. Dolittle' was a smash, but a career setback to say the least. `Holy Man' was an unmitigated disaster, but one that didn't effect Murphy with any real damage. The greatest gift `Life' gives to Murphy is a chance to show off range.  Murphy is a very talented actor, and this movie makes you wish he would try a straight drama for once. Murphy can be devastatingly funny. But he can also be very dramatically convincing.  With each new movie, Murphy grows as an actor. I really think he's set for brighter things. Martin Lawrence shares many of the same attributes as Murphy.  He's terribly funny, and yet able to win your heart with a depth most comedians don't have. `Life' has Lawrence with the quieter role.  He uses that chance to provide the film with a backbone. He eventually comes out the best rounded character in the fractured storytelling.  It's a good performance, but even better, it's a brilliant pairing with Eddie Murphy.  The two are seamlessly funny.  Squeezing every moment for comic and emotional juice.  It's refreshing to watch a movie with two actors who seem to be trying something different, all the while living up to previous expectations. Ted Demme is a solid director, a thought that immediately puts me in the minority.  His `Who's The Man?' was a strictly silly romp, but was actually funny. `The Ref' was the critically lauded and sharp black comedy. `Beautiful Girls' is a film that every time I sit down to watch, feels as comfortable as an old cardigan. He's yet to falter in my eyes.  I like his attention to detail, and his gift for trusting his actors. `Life' wouldn't work as well as it does without a specific amount of direction and free will. Demme manages to keep the film on track without ever succumbing to an over-reliance on improv.  The best scenes in `Life' are the quiet ones the gay inmate who's release from prison provides a dilemma, the passage of time montage, and Lawrence's moment with the freshly baked pies(which is actually comical, but who's counting?).  The film seems like it was longer at one point, but the film on display here really pleased me. I would recommend this film to anybody that has lost faith in Eddie Murphy.------------- 9 "},{"Title":"A great movie backed up by a great cast...","Date":"10 August 1999","Score":"15 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Martin Lawrence finally sheds his Whats UUUUUUUUUUP! image with a stellar performance in Life.

At first glance the title seems to refer to the life sentence wrongly given to the two men. As the story unfolds, the viewer sees the life they must make for themselves in the spartan setting of a prison in Mississippi. The end of the film should bring the viewer to question what he has done with his life and how much he has depended on props for a meaning to his own life.Many who submitted comments compared Life with The Shawshank Redemption, but a more likely comparison is Cool Hand Luke, which starred Paul Newman in a similar story also set in a Mississippi prison. The comic gags, such as the warden's curvaceous daughter, were taken from Cool Hand Luke. Overall, the film is rich in meaning as it shows how life in general is an interweaving of comedy and tragedy. Another comparison story is Death Comes for the Archbishop by Willa Cather, in which Ms. Cather shows how two priests, also in a spartan situation (a desert pastorate in New Mexico) and without the usual trappings of success, make meaningful lives for themselves while living sacrificially for others.

The film's major problem is that in trying too much it achieves too little.  It's okay for a film to try to be more than JUST a comedy, or JUST a drama, or JUST a historical film.  Forrest Gump knew how to mix those three -- but by alternating them, so that one could taste each distinct flavor, not by trying to mix them in one big homogenous bland soup. That the boys are wrongfully imprisoned is sad; that their attempts to get out, via escape and other, more legitimate means, fail, is sad; when they bicker, it's sad.  But neither of them really seems to feel the rage such an injustice would impart; yet the jokes are too few and far between to assume it's because we're just supposed to laugh it off.  Meanwhile, a film that covers 40+ years gives only a nodding glance at the history going on outside the prison.  I felt really uncomfortable being white during the racist scenes in the early parts, but those, at least, were handled with deft humor, and I was glad for the bit of redemption at the end.  It's a little funny, and a little sad, and a little of everything else -- maybe a little like life, actually, but much less moving.

However when running moonshine across the Bible belt they encounter racism and eventually get framed for a murder by a racist sheriff.  Sentenced to life they experience a range of things but eventually find that friendship can overcome many things during a course of a life.I approach this with a certain amount of caution.  I expected a buddy comedy full of the heavy-handed comedy that usually comes with a Murphy or a Lawrence movie.  Admittedly it does have a certain amount of that &#150; but in small amounts it can be quite funny.  The story doesn't create as good a relationship between Ray and Claude as it could have done, and ignores any brutality that may occur, but it still manages to have poignant things to say about friendship.The `old' makeup isn't as good it could have been but it passes.  The story isn't anywhere near Shawshank but it tries to cover similar ground.  Although it never reaches that level it is a lot more involving than you'd expect it to be.  It may always come down to Murphy and Lawrence bickering but it isn't just that.  My only criticism of it is that it appears to have been more fun to make than it is to watch &#150; the outtakes are the funniest bit in the whole thing.Murphy and Lawrence are not the most subtle of performers but they do OK here.  They do better at the comedy than the serious elements but both are warm enough to convince.  The cast is made up of a range of reasonable black actors and comedians &#150; Bernie Mac is funny, but again this feeds into the image that the real fun was had in the making of the film rather than the actual film itself.  Interesting side roles are given to Ned Beatty, R. Lee Ermey, Bokeem Woodbine, Rick James, Lisa Nicole Carson and Heavy D.Overall this isn't just a buddy comedy and it isn't quite as meaningful as Shawshank.  It falls in-between and, while it's not a classic it's still quite enjoyable to watch &#150; even if all the best bits are in the outtakes at the end.

The two men are framed for murder whilst they are completing a bootlegging job in Mississippi for Spanky Johnson (Rick James) - a man to whom the two men owe a lot of money. The story chronicles their early life in prison in 1930's Mississippi right the way through to the present day.This film gets off to a fairly impressive start; the bootlegging aspect of the film sets Ray and Claude up as a mismatched buddy duo (a tired scenario even by 1999, but amusing nonetheless). The 'no coloureds allowed' scene in the café was quite funny, but for me it was also clumsy and rather heavy-handed (as were many of the scenes in this film). Once they've collected the alcohol the two men lose all their money in a combination of stupidity and naivety which again was quite amusing. Where it really started to fall apart for me was when the two men end up in prison....This seemed to be where the film almost grinds to a halt and becomes repetitive, tedious and uninteresting. Many of the Southern characters are dull clichés and sadly none of them get any kind of development and nor are we given any reason to care for any of them. The only mildly interesting character was Can't Get Right who shows himself to be an exceptional baseball player and ends up getting a pardon so he can compete professionally - although it's fair to presume that he made it big it might have been nice if this was added as a little insert at the end. As mentioned, poor characterisation is what really lets this film down; in most prison dramas there are usually at least one or two side characters who the protagonists form bonds with and this is what usually helps to give films of this nature some lift, but to me this really just felt like the Lawrence and Murphy show. It's probably inaccurate to class a lot of the cast as supporting characters as they acted more like extras than anything else. This point is further reinforced by the fact that many of the characters just disappeared from screen (literally) later in the film - presumably because they either die or end up being released - again this is never made clear. It's strange that this is classed as a story about two men spending 65 years in prison because to me it actually felt like a story without a story - many things seemed to happen that end up going nowhere, seemingly important plot points are established without being expanded upon (such as Claude's appeal). This aimless feel to the film sadly made it feel quite boring to me.Lawrence and Murphy are the only things that really prevent this film from being a complete disaster; Murphy brings his usual energy to the table and is great fun to watch. Lawrence fares well here as the straight man and bounces well off Murphy. Together, Murphy and Lawrence's chemistry is good, but again even they start to become tiresome (particularly in the latter stages when they are old men). The film has some amusing prison moments - the governor holding his daughter's baby up to each of the inmates to determine who the father is was actually a stroke of genius. I have to admit that the ending was very clever as well. However, these good moments were few and far between. Die-hard Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence fans may get something out of this, but there are far better prison dramas out there and this for me stands as one of the weakest that I've seen.

I guess the biggest surprise this movie could deliver was that it wasn't that funny. I have to admit the biggest laughs in the whole movie were in the outtakes tacked on the end as the credits were rolling. I don't mean to express that this was a terrible movie by any stretch of the imagination, but don't expect wall to wall laughs, which is hard because of the cast involved. Life follows the life sentence of two guys, who get caught being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Shockingly, there were more serious moments than comic ones. More often than not we are just as frustrated as these two guys, being sent to prison for life. Taking place in Mississippi, I guess the filmmakers thought placing Murphy and Lawrence as two New Yorkers stuck in a southern prison would add to the laughs. It just added to the frustration. Overacting my too many of the other inmates made the dialogue virtually impossible to understand at times. However, the primary problem with this film lay mostly in waiting for humor that never quite surfaced. I understand that a movie doesn't' have to be funny to be good, even if it stars Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, two of their generations great comedians. But as much as this didn't work as a comedy, it just wasn't serious enough for me to work as a drama. Sure I cared about the characters, but I don't even know if I was supposed to.

Life is easily one of Eddie Murphy's better movies outside of the Shrek movie line, and let's face it, outside of Shrek, Eddie doesn't really have such a strong resume of decent films, but Life is an exception. Now before I really go in depth with this review, let me point out that Life isn't your typical straight off the assembly line buddy flick, despite what the advertising for this film suggests; this movie has a very serious undertone which at times turns to an overtone and it's armed with razor sharp teeth. With that in mind let's dive right in! Life is told in flashback by an elderly prisoner talking to two younger prisoners about the fast talking pick pocket Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) and serious would-be bank teller Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence). In 1932, both Ray and Claude were in debt to a loan shark named Spanky. In order to pay off Spanky, both men agreed to travel from New York to Mississippi to pick up moonshine and take it back with them.

Over the years, they have a series of experiences, sometimes wacky, sometimes revealing new dimensions to their characters. Obviously, the very thought of a movie starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence sounds like it would have to be pure junk. Looking at the poster, one might think that the whole movie consists of them getting bullied by giant inmates (and there are some scenes like that). But this flick actually has a plot. There's obviously the context of the Jim Crow south - which, believe it or not, leads to a really funny situation at one point. All in all, this is a very well done comedy - silly at times, but definitely worth seeing. We can say with certainty that Ted Demme had a very good track record as a director (he was also behind The Ref and Blow); too bad he died so young.*Unfortunately, his last few years have consisted of fare like I Spy and Daddy Day Care.

If you approach this movie expecting it to be a major comedy, I think you will be disappointed. But if you're just looking for a FEW laughs (and maybe a good cry here and there), this is a pretty good movie. No matter how much you've learned about slavery and the south and everything relating to the setting of this movie, I think most people still tend to watch it and think Whoa, were things really like that? And to be honest, it's not really a bad thing. A movie that makes you think a little bit is usually a good thing. But, with that said, it's not an eye-opening, tear-jerking, life-altering film like some other classics (I won't name them all). I don't think they quite developed the relationship between the characters as much as they could have, and the friendship between the two main characters take much too long to form (in my opinion), but if you're even relatively emotional when it comes to films about oppression, you'll probably get attached to the characters and sympathize with their troubles. So really, it's no waste of time, and the worst that can happen is you don't find it up to par with your comedy taste.

This is a DRAMA and the comedy is subtle with a human touch, thanks to the direction of Ted Demme (RIP). Everyone involved with this film seemed to have done their homework on history, racism in the south, to the set designs and costumes. This was sorely overlooked by the Academy (who would nominate an Eddie Murphy film for costume design???), but let's get pass my ranting. Life is a classic story of friendship. Two opposites are thrown together after being falsely accused of murdering a con artist down south. What surprised me most about this movie is the amount of comedic talent and how little they're allowed to actually be funny. It's like the plot is holding them back from going all out. And this is the first time Martin is actually playing the straight man, a role I believe he should play more often instead of his usual crazy schitck which most of the time doesn't stick.Eddie's terrific in this movie, using his motormouth for a fully fleshed out character. When he's fast talking, he isn't doing it for the sake of it. The supporting cast including Anthony Anderson, Bernie Mac, Guy Torry, and (gasp) Rick James, all provide good roles.

Life, Murphy's latest film died. Life is a bad idea and racist.In Life, two black Americans Ray and Claude (Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence) are sentenced wrongly to lifelong terms in prison on a fitted up charge of murder.  This happens in what must have been among the most racist of American states Mississippi.  However Eddie Murphy, who produced Life as well as playing one of the two leading roles, tries to turn what you would think would have been a dismal prison drama into a bitter sweet comedy. I guess you can sell more tickets that way.So Murphy's prison seems to be more like a country holiday camp than the expected hell hole, with baseball, barbecues, unending sunny days and plenty of laughs. Ray and Claude, who weren't friends before they went to jail, in the tradition of The Shawshank Redemption, The Odd Couple or even Grumpy Old Men, maintain their mock animosity and a friendship develops.But what of reality? Prison for black Americans in Mississippi through the thirties for sixty-five years would have been for the most part horrific I would think and portraying this situation so fondly strikes me as being an ill founded attempt at historical revisionism.But I'd also think that playing the inmates as high voiced, roll eyed caricatures, would also be insulting to right thinking people.Note the rumblings of disappointment about the jive talking digital creature in the latest Star Wars film; an invention straight out of the Amos And Andy talent stable. If any actor black or white had played Jar Jar Binks like that he would have been in real trouble, and especially if he had been white. But an African American playing Jar Jar Binks in that racist, demeaning way should raise similar hackles. Similar rules should apply to our black film stars.It's impossible for me here in Australia to make any really meaningful comment on what may or may not be acceptable to African Americans in this regard, but I'd imagine that if a white actor had played a black American in that way there would be hell to pay and rightly so.Eddie Murphy is an intelligent and capable actor. The Distinguished Gentleman, a film where he plays an African American who runs for the American Congress, shows just how upbeat and responsible Murphy's characters can be, but Life is low life.The (white) teenagers in the cinema with me thought that these actors were hilarious judging by their laughter but it appeared to me that their reaction was caused by their sniggers to this ninties version of  niggers (the term nigger was used repeatedly by the inmates in the film).That's not healthy and it's also not funny.

While down there, they're set up by a white cop for the murder of a black man and sentenced to life in prison. While in prison they try numerous escapes, make some friends, and grow old together. When you hear that Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence are making a film together, you think that this could be the funniest movie ever made. Two talented comedians working side by side, how could it not be? Well, when the story line deals with two black men being put in prison for a crime they didn't commit by a white racist cop, it's hard for a movie to be truly funny. I think the writers were trying to make some sort of social commentary at the same time and while I commend them for that, it wastes the talents of the two stars. They were always shackled by the knowledge that they weren't supposed to be in prison, so there was always that feeling of hatred going on. Now, that's not to say the movie wasn't funny. At times it was laugh out loud funny.  Murphy especially was in fine form with a lot of ad-libs and Lawrence kept right up with him. I was afraid that with two stars such as these two that there might be a problem of egos and who should get more laughs, but they worked well together. And when they were allowed to just go off they made it very funny. But again the story got in the way. There was a sub-plot of the prison director's daughter getting pregnant by one of the inmates. I didn't really see the point of that. They used the baby for a one minute gag and that was it. The story also seemed choppy. The movie starts in 1932 and ends 60 years later, so it wasn't like they could go start to finish, but it moved along very quickly at times. The makeup effects (by Rick Baker) were incredible. Murphy and Lawrence aged 60 years right before our very eyes.Life was more of a heartwarming comedy than a straight out comedy. It made you laugh but it also got very serious (especially near the end when the cop who put them in prison came back). Ray and Claude went through a lot of hell that they didn't deserve but they persevered and made it through. When it was funny, it was very funny. But with the story line it was also very serious which I thought restrained the humor.

Convincing makeup demonstrates the ageing process. Both Murphy and Lawrence share a wonderful chemistry that endures until the injustice is faced.

The plot runs almost identical - they are innocent but are sentenced to spend the rest of their life in prison. The truth of their innocence later comes out but it is to late, and nobody ever hears because the only people who know land up dead. In the end, though some elaborate plan, they escape.There is a difference in the themes though. The Shawshank Redemption is subtly a horror movie in which the horror of spending forever in one place, with the glimpse of hope, is portrayed. In this movie there is hope, but it is in crazy plans, and it is relationships that are the focus, and also it is a comedy as opposed to a horror. Most people don't see the Shawshank Redemption as a horror, but a horror this is not, rather it is a comedy.There is little that I can say about this movie except that it runs like a typical Eddie Murphy movie. Eddie plays his typical fast talking, con-man character who always has another scheme to make him rich, and the scheme generally does not work. Martin Lawrence plays the straight laced character who sees everything Murphy does is too risky and tries, unsuccessfully, to talk him out of it. They are, and end up being, the odd couple - two friends who can't really get along.This was a cool movie, and though it is slow at places, when the laughs come, they come as one would expect Eddie Murphy to deliver them. I guess the best was the cornbread gag, and later the drug smuggling gag. They also have out takes at the end (somebody seems to have been copying Jackie Chan) and there is a nice surprise with this one.

Without seeming pretentious, the film dips into various social, even contemporary issues, dealing comically with police perjury, corrupt/disinterested judicial systems, incompetent defence lawyers, institutionalized racism, a legal system which leaves defendants hanging, the sanctioning and covering up of injustices, shattered dreams and an underclass who are oppressed by a criminal justice system for the system's own social/political benefit. Mostly, though, the film's an excuse for Lawrence and Murphy to drop some F bombs. To date it's Murphy's last R rated movie.With moments of overbearing sentimentality the films at times seems to pander to the Shawshank Redemption crowd, but much foul mouthed humour, wisecracks and buddy banter help offset this.8/10 &#x96; With Bowfinger and Life, 1999 was perhaps Murphy's last respectable year as a comedian.

Its about the lives of two men that get sentenced for life as well as having a slight hint on a moral grounds of the message of life! (Sorry, I couldn't help it). A decent movie made just before the sad and gradual decline of the two stars, Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence (with movies like Big Mommas Like Father Like Son and Norbit).The movie opens with two inmates burying the bodies of two deceased inmates and an elderly man in a wheelchair who claims to have known them for a long time. He then goes into a story about the lives of the deceased, and we are thrown into New York 1932. The movie is then told in a progression through time with the wheel chaired man giving an occasional narration.OK, so a quick rundown on the plot of the movie. Murphy plays a conman by the name of Rayford Gibson and Lawrence a professional man named Claude Banks (who will shortly start a job as a bank teller). Both men owe a mobster money. They get a chance to stay alive by doing a booze run in acquiring some moon shine from Mississippi. There they lose all their money and are accused of having killed a man. Charged with both this and bootlegging, the two are sentenced to life in prison. Across the 65 year sentence the two men constantly bicker, make and lose friends and figure out ways to escape from their dreary misfortune.The movie is directed by Ted Demme (Blow and Snitch), this was his second last movie. In short, the guy knew what he was doing. And kudos to him for this movie, I personally cannot find too much to complain about in this area, but if you guys do, lemme know.As for the acting itself, it is fairly decent but obviously not Oscar worthy. Murphy and Lawrence show great chemistry during this movie. Playing two absolute strangers who happen to become friends as they age to about 90 at the end of the movie. It is because they were originally strangers that the two are mainly bickering to each other throughout the movie, often using quips, threats and insults. This is where quite a lot of the comedy lies, with these remarks between each other and some of the other stars like Anthony Anderson, Bernie Mac, Guy Torry just to name a few.Another good performance is from Nick Cassavetes who plays the sergeant of the prison. Easily one can tell that his character is a racist with the way he treats the prisoners but the movie does well in making him more than two dimensional as his character actually changes through the movie.This movie also attempts to have some heart, which well, not like Shawshank Redemption, but it pulls it off in some places. Namely with the progression of the friendship of Ray and Claude, but with stories of some of the other characters and the hard life they have with their long sentences. The viewer may feel slight attachment or sympathy for these characters but these things are never lingered on for too long and so will quickly be forgotten.The movie also has subtle humour in some serious situations. Namely when Ray (Eddie Murphy's character) finds out nobody can read, so he reads a letter for an inmate. The letter reveals that practically everyone of his family has died, some from bizarre cases. When finished, Ray offers if anyone else wants a letter read and as one they say no and turn away.I could go on to complain that the make-up used to age the characters could have looked more convincing and so on but I know that wasn't really the movie's aim. So really, who cares?For a movie that is entertaining, in both being funny and slightly serious with a good ending, I truly think this movie is one for people to watch. Not saying you would think its the best thing out there, or that you should hunt it down like a piece of treasure. But if you do get your hands on this, sit down and watch it, especially if you guys are fans of Eddie Murphy or Martin Lawrence.originally posted on my blog www.comikkazee.com "},{"Title":"A good Comedic and Dramatic movie with Eddie as a dramatic actor that must NOT be ignored!","Date":"14 August 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" I thought this movie was funny, but also serious as well.

Especially the montage with characters fading from the screen was a really smart thing to do, it kept the pace, at the same time it created an emotional moment that couldn't be surpassed by any worn-out death scene.

Mis-matched from the ghet-co, Ray Gibson and Claude Banks (Murphy and Lawrence, respectively) spend some hard time getting to know, detest, and finally, love, one another, while befriending fellow inmates Willie Long (the narrator), Jangle Leg (a riotous Bernie Mac), Biscuit, Goldmouth, Can't Get Right and others, and combating against the brutal (yet inane) prison system, while undertaking several schemes of escape. Life is sometimes hilarious, sometimes somber, sometimes nostalgic, and always entertaining. The comedic duo of Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence is nothing short of sheer casting dynamite, and both comedians deliver some of their finest roles here. It's rife with whimsical southern dialect (You go eat your cornbread?; I da pappy; etc.) and Eddie Murphy's raucous personality translates perfectly here (Anyone mess around with me, it's gon' be consequences and repercussions!); this is perhaps the most hysterical and amusing dialog ever written for a southern comedy. Also worth commending is the exquisitely perfect makeup work of Rick Baker Murphy and Lawrence as feuding old folks- only Baker could achieve such an infeasible task! Life is a genuinely hilarious, if conventional and clichéd, comedy, which delivers supremely on laughs, character development, and solid entertainment.

By the end of the film, its true that we are happy to see Ray and Claude finally free and enjoying a baseball game, but the film would have you forget that they are decrepit old men in their 90s who have basically spent their entire lives in prison because of racism. Their entire lives have been taken away, but the movie wants us to forget about that and get a good laugh from their relentless bickering and things like Claude getting one of his toes stuck in the bottle.Luckily, Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence work so well together on screen that the comedy that we get from their interaction does, in fact, achieve this strange goal that the movie strives for the whole time. They are both undeniably funny guys, so the comedy in the film is unmistakable, but it's interesting to consider the magnitude with which the painful prejudices that the movie deals with are ignored in favor of what is, at many parts, little more than slapstick comedy.In the movie's defense, however, it is a good comedy once the ignorance of the racial element is removed, and even when that portion of the film's components is considered, it still manages to walk the fine line between comedy and drama, although just barely. The film manages to avoid the all too common mistake of having the main character(s) fall into masses of trouble by sheer stupidity (which is, admittedly, more a problem in romantic comedies than in films like this). Ray and Claude are both not the most upstanding of citizens when we first meet them, but it seems that they are each on the verge of turning their lives around, to some extent at least, when they get framed for a murder. Instead of picking pockets, Ray gets robbed at a poker game, and Claude gets stuck with Ray on a bootlegging trip to avoid the wrath of some powerful gangster.The man who cheated at the poker game and took all of Ray's money and his father's watch is found dead (by Ray and Claude, as it were), so while Ray is going through the dead man's pockets trying to find his watch, they are approached by a bunch of rednecks (whose inbred appearances are rivaled only by the subhumans in the Gator Bait films), who decide that they are doing a good deed by bringing the two black guys downtown. Thus begins Ray's and Claude's REAL troubles, and they spend the rest of their lives trying to prove their innocence and get their lives back.The majority of the film takes place in prison, spanning decades of wrongful imprisonment for Ray and Claude and introducing several interesting and amusing characters just long enough to affect us as several of them disappear from the film in a sequence of elliptical editing that does not seem to fit with the rest of the movie. There are several escape attempts, many of which are there entirely for comic relief (Ray would not have even been able to get into and fly a plane, much less survive that fiery crash), in which the film desperately tries to be an even more comic version of the vastly superior Cool Hand Luke. Unfortunately, Ray Gibson and Claude Banks COMBINED do not even come close to Paul Newman's remarkably memorable Luke Jackson. They don't match the character, the ingeniousness of the escape attempts, or the comic appeal, of which there was virtually none at many points.On the other hand, it's obvious that this is not a film that is to be taken to seriously. Walk into any video store in the world and you will find Life in the comedy section, because that is the type of film that it sets out to be, and that is what it becomes. In that sense, the film succeeds on many levels. Martin Lawrence and Edie Murphy work very well on the screen, the comedy is unmistakable, and we even get a satisfactory ending to such minor subplots as the theft of Ray's father's watch (and, incidentally, his and Claude's wrongful imprisonment), but it all comes down to the film asking us to ignore too much material (such as, for example, the ultimate fate of the nice white man who shot another white man to protect a couple of black convicts, as well as things like why there is a nice old lady living in a cute little house literally within pie-sniffing distance of the prison camp, and with no fences in between). It cannot be denied that the movie does address at several points the racism involved, but it still makes every effort to remain a comedy, and it succeeds at that, but the conflict between drama and comedy is not resolved, leaving us amused but p***ed off.This delicate balance between drama and comedy can be done successfully, one has only to watch a film like Life Is Beautiful to see it done nearly flawlessly, but that is because that film USED the comedy in order to enhance the drama involved. The comedy made Guido an immensely likable character, which made us root for him much more and made us ultimately more affected by his misfortunes. In the case of Life, no one seems to want to put in that much effort. We get a good comedy that is riddled with the horrible affects of racism, with the unfortunate result that we get lots of good laughs throughout the film, but feel guilty afterward when we consider the events that led to it.

I think he is at least in the top 3.Anyway, this movie gave me the opportunity to see Martin Lawrence do some good material, too.It's too bad that when we think of Eddie, we think comedy. Granted, he is a grand comedian, but he's done a number of characters and stories that do have messages and significant meaning, whether or not they smashed the box office I care not (must everything be about money and pop acceptance?)This is perhaps the most melancholy of his stories, pregnant with emotion. Again, had Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman been cast respectively as Ray Gibson and Willy, (of course, Freeman was a main character in the similar Shawshank Redemption) it might have been carried off with more sobriety; thus, there is a perpetual comedic skin over the movie that may blind us from the gravity of the themes being developed. Too bad. Shame on the director.Further, I'd be very impressed to know that certain segments of society are able to relate to the situation. Without making a connection, it can be blown off with nary a second thought. Some scenes, taken in the context of the whole story, can bring tears. For example, who wasn't moved by Beaches? Yet this story is sadder, more maddening, more frustrating, and grander in scope than the situation that befell Barbara and Bette.I loved this movie. Absolutely. In all its facets.

I was very distressed by the attitude of the whites-only restaurant and felt great compassion when the well- meaning warden died before he could have released them. But my favourite scene is when Ray tells the inmates his dream about his club and everyone pitches in. Ray is the host, Goldmouth ( Michael Taliferro) is the doorman and Biscuit (Miguel A.

Of course, one cannot stop making comparisons with the great The Shawshank Redemption and one of the similarities is the hardships that await inmates before re-entering society. In the aforementioned movie, the old man (probably the bookkeeper) kills himself soon after his release. In Life, Biscuit kills himself by forcing a guard to shoot him, a day before being released.I enjoyed Life very, very much for its strong performances (both lead and supporting) and the great feeling of friendship between Ray and Claude. 8/10.

Dont get me wrong, I love Eddie Murphy, always have, always will. But Lawerence Im not crazy about. Hes easy to get on your last nerve, except here hes a key dramatic player whos funniness comes out of his bad, bad luck, usually having much to do with the partnership of smooth, loudmouthed bootlegger and pickpocket Eddie Murphy. I think Murphy, after age, has been giving us a continous theme in his movies. Hes become kinder and gentler, more family-oriented, and you can see it in very small undertones here, even as he cheats, steals, and curses. In the 80s he was always the charming scoundrel in a ladies man sort of way. In the 90s hes a charming scoundrel in a husband and father sort of way (and like cornbread, aint nothin wrong with that!) I was very intrigued with the opening of the story because I was familiar with fancy white nightclubs of the 1930s, but not so familiar of the black (unless you want to count the droll, forgettable gangster film HOODLUM). Afterwards Lawerence and Murphy end up in a prison camp for life. And I kept wanting them to escape because I wanted them back in the 30s-era city. Oh well, this is still a surprisingly good movie, with smart notions of racism and other prejudices. Although it isnt for all tastes (and you probably know who you are), if you liked Murphy in almost anything and are willing to give Lawerence a chance (hes surprisingly a good actor), then keep this movie in mind if you arrive to the video store on a rainy day and everything good is checked out.

I think it wanted to be something in between but it spent so much time trying to be a buddy movie that the dramatic aspects mostly fell flat.  Every time there was a dramatic scene I kept thinking is this really supposed to be a dramatic scene?The characters' behavior was sometimes perplexing.  Why did Lawrence's character (Claude) act SO unfriendly toward Murphy's character (Ray) IMMEDIATELY AFTER Ray saved Claude's life?  Why was it that Ray and Claude were never shot at after they crossed the gun line?  (Except for the one time Claude went after the pies.)  Law enforcement characters were sometimes menacing, sometimes laughably bumbling -- and I mean the same characters.

Just  because a movie is a clear drama doesn't exclude it from containing comedy, Life Is Beautiful being the obvious example.

This was a time when life meant life - the only way out was a pardon (very rare) or death. Murphy does an excellent job as the aging Gibson his mannerisms and voice are perfect. Lawrence does a good job as well.  The real star here however is Rick Baker's makeup (for which he's won several awards in the past) - you really believe that the actors are the old men they're playing.

Lawrence's work is, not surprisingly, better than Murphy, who never seems to display much emotion beyond angry bravado and mugging for the camera. The exception is the last 10-15 minutes of the film, where old-age makeup seems to give him the license he needs to show some genuine emotion.In addition, there is a great supporting cast, including Bernie Mac and Miguel A.

I don't think he has truly hit the big time since his Beverly Hills Cop days. Ever since then he has lost his comic talents in a succession of limp and detrimental scripts.Life, doesn't quite put any life into propping up Murphy's career profile either. One would have thought being partnered with a fellow black hipster/ad-libber like Lawrence we could have expected something far more entertaining.As it is the script seems stuck in a rut, as if it has approached a road that has forked into two directions and the screenplay isn't sure whether to go for out-and-out quickfire comedy or mild drama depicting a racist society & personal friendship in such adversity. Ultimately it tries to take an invisible middle way of combining both but only just fails.I think one of the problems is the well-tried formula of the black buddy-buddy boys stuck in a racist plot scenario! Too many films go down this road with mixed results this film is no different and thus offers the viewer nothing new in the way of enlightenment.There are the usual signposts that add credence to this the racist police and prison guards; the hilly-billy rednecks straight out of Deliverance or Hills Have Eyes, and black people portrayed as gangsters in the 30s trying to get by and feeling hard done to by an uncaring world.Murphy/Lawrence try hard with this well-worn themed script but neither of them can really make it work without resorting to type. ie. loads of quickfire foul-mouthed hip language that we have seen many times before from both actors (Bev. Hills Cop, Trading Places & Bad Boys et al).Behind the comic facade is a moving story of friendship between the two wrongfully accused cons as they share their enforced imprisonment over the next 60 years. This friendship story only really materialises in the last 30 minutes and I think the very end is very much a cop-out to keep the audiences happy.The music, cinematography and especially the make-up by Rick Baker, is a treat. But the direction runs out of steam purely because of the indifferent script.There is also surprise cameos from Ned Beatty & R. Lee Emery. But it is very much a vehicle for both Murphy/Lawrence to try and springboard their careers back into the limelight rather than the continuing dance in the shadows of averageness.In fairness some of the humour is very very funny, and the out-takes at the end are gems as well.

Maybe it was because he was buried under a ton of makeup and it was enough to subdue his personality that I bought into the more emotional moments of that movie. An example would be when Sherman is ridiculed in the nightclub. I felt soooooo bad for him. In this movie, the drama rings hollow and the comedy is DOA. The funniest part of the movie were the out-takes and that is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. This is the first movie of Ted Demme's that I didn't like. Who's the Man? The Ref, and Beautiful Girls were all great movies. The characters are not fully developed and therefore, I didn't care about them. It's the same way I feel about Any Given Sunday - although that got a much higher rating - I just didn't care about the characters. If you want to see a great prison drama, watch Shawshank. If you want a great prison comedy, watch Stir Crazy. If you want to waste $4.00 (or whatever a rental is)- then rent Life.  Like the great prophet Miller says, That's just my opinion...I could be wrong.

Eddie Murphy just isn't that funny of an actor anyways, plus the writing was horrible.  I suggest that instead of spending time watching this movie you spend it doing something more meaning full, like watching the grass grow.

If I were you I would go to the nearest 7 Eleven and drink a slur pee fast to the brain because this film will drag in comparison. Two great stars. Both with bad film choices. The film starts off by Martins character getting arrested with Eddies character for a crime that neither one of them committed. However, knowing this from the start did not stop them from hating each other throughout the film for various reasons or another. The rest of the characters are straight from PRISON MOVIE R US. The gay guy, the straight guy, the fat guy and so on. All played by a strong crop of talented African American comedians who were clearly in it for the paycheck and not the material. The story winds through close to 40 years of Prison time in the film. During their time they train a sex starved baseball great, train people how to read and even see some of the other characters die off. (Something that happened to me after the opening credits). In the end they escape prison not from the discovered evidence of their innocence but by a Prison FIRE of all sorts. They really should of saved the heat for the film to which was slow and mellow dramatic and not deserving of the stars whom participated in its creation. My recommendation is if you much watch this film watch it while doing your taxes so you hopefully won't fall asleep.

Hoo, boy! Probably the single, most entertaining movie that I have seen, which dealt with the concepts of racism, wrongful prosecution, cruel and unusual punishment, prison homosexuality (a la Shawshank Redemption), murder, suicide, the valuelessness of living in a post-Lenin world, age and infirmity, buck teeth, cornbread and consumption, flatulence, fantasy, bastard children, retardation, minor- and major- league baseball, drug smuggling, bootlegging, prostitution, card hustling, pickpocketing, organized crime, xeno-/homo-/thana-/gerio-/algo- (and mayhaps triskaideka-)phobia, andpseudo-quasi-semi-demi-demo-proto-uni-bi-ab-circum-dendro-chrono-socio-myo-n ympho-micro-mini-necro-humor. In other words, it is not so much...funny, as it is...not funny. The rare moments of laughter in my theater came from the seat next to me, where my friend was desperately seeking a real reason for having paid to see this movie. I give this film one post-super nova singularity, because I cannot give it a star. The quasi-star that I was going to give it exploded outward before collapsing onto itself beneath the weight of it's own chromosphere, thus creating an infinitely deep well of gravity from which not even blessed light or laughter may possibly escape.
