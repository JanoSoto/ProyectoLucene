[{"Title":"An excellent adaptation of a scholarly work","Date":"22 April 1999","Score":"89 out of 97 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  For me the power of this movie rests in its faithfulness to Margaret Rosenthal's book the Honest Courtesan; which is a well-researched look at Veronica Franco's life and the plight of Venetian women in the 16th century. Dangerous Beauty, while making certain assumptions and taking some literary license, was a talented translation of Rosenthal's careful research into a captivating film. Many of the witty remarks and social commentary come directly from 16th century documents. Surprisingly the most unbelievable aspect of the movie (her escape from the Inquisition and support from prominent Venetian nobles) is historical fact. While the details are unknown and the movie is certainly more romatically dramatic than I would imagine the actual historical event, it was very true to the spirit and feel supported by the evidence we have.Venetian women, and indeed most medieval women, were in an unenviable position as second class citizens. Veronica Franco's struggle to find an acceptable position in society as a woman of good family but poor, is representative of the moral and societal conflicts of her time. Courtesans were not respected but they were accepted as a necessary evil. Their income was even taxable! In a society where female chastity was considered sacrosanct if she were to marry and a marriage bed was no less for sale than a courtesan's, women's choices were limited indeed. Franco's impassioned cry in the movie I did what was necessary to survive! is no less true were it not a verbatim report of her defense. As a penniless girl her options were limited to scullery work, the nunnery or prostitution. Her distinction was that, while she chose to sell her body, she never chose to be dominated by her profession or those who sought her out. In publishing her book of poetry and personal letters, she redefined herself as a woman first and a courtesan second. Using her wit to defend herself in the public arena she skillfully manipulated accepted literary mores of the day to show her mastery of the literary as well as political implications of her position.Her greatest detractors were courtiers, such as Maffio Venier, who competed with courtesans for the money bestowed by wealthy patrons. As she says in the movie, they must both sing for their suppers. The problem is that while she is willing to accept they are equal in their need of patronage, he is unwilling to be outdone by a woman. His misogynistic works of poetry were directed toward Franco and other courtesans with the intent of parading his own virtue by damning theirs. The greatest irony is that Maffio was ultimately killed by a sexual disease while Franco died of causes unrelated to her sexual practices.While there are those who might see this movie as an acceptance of prostitution, I believe they are missing the true story behind the sexual facade which they are focusing on. Franco's life was one of courage and honesty. She made choices that we may not understand, but we do not live in her world. And she accepted both the privilege and the degradation that her position brought her. This movie is a powerful tribute to one who sought more in life than mere existence and who faced her trials with the courage of her convictions, whether or not we or others share those convictions is immaterial.

A good girl that falls in love with a prince (he's from a family with a title and she's not) but will true love prevail?

"},{"Title":"Engaging Story, Excellent Performances","Date":"3 March 2002","Score":"37 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  	There's a consistent moral thread that runs through every society from age to age and generation to generation, the tenets of which are established within parameters, and therefore subject to change; or more specifically, subject to a change in perspective.  And that change can come very quickly-- veritably over night in some instances.  There is also another constant that defines the human condition in any era, and as we find in `Dangerous Beauty,' directed by Marshall Herskovitz, it is the fact that an individual will do whatever is necessary to survive.  It is simply an undeniable, irrefutable basic instinct of the human animal.  Moral tenets and survival, however, taken as properties are something akin to oil and water, and will mix accordingly.  Being more often than not polar opposites, conflict is inherent and will ultimately surface at some point or other, the outcome of which is determined by the strength of whichever perspective is prevalent at the moment.  And it is at such moments that we discover that life, like politics, can be a sordid, unpleasant affair; or at the other end of the spectrum, the greatest gift of all.	It's 16th Century Venice; Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) is of a wealthy and powerful family, and is a Senator in good standing in the community.  He is also in love with Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), who though intelligent and beautiful, is beneath Marco's station in society, and they are, therefore, forbidden to marry.  Instead, Marco's father, Pietro (Jeroen Krabbe), has arranged a marriage for his son, an alliance that will be to the substantial benefit of both families.  Veronica's family, meanwhile, due to prevailing circumstances must look to Veronica for support, so her mother, Paola (Jacqueline Bisset), not only arranges for Veronica to become a courtesan, but instructs her herself in the fine art of seduction and the kind of pleasures that will put the most coins in the coffers, as well as how to survive by being in love with `love.'  	For Veronica, it soon becomes a lucrative, if not fulfilling enterprise, but there are clouds forming on the horizon, the least of which involves an impending war with the Turks, a war they cannot win without the help of King Henry (Jake Weber) of France.  Very quickly, life in Venice changes; Marco is off to war, and the formerly open acceptance of the courtesans undergoes a swift and drastic reversal of perspective among a seeming majority of those within the city.  And once again Veronica's life is in flux; and she is about to find out that it will never be the same again.	Nicely presented and beautifully filmed (the cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is exquisite), Herskovitz's film-- which is based on a true story and adapted from Margaret Rosenthal's novel by screenwriter Jeannine Dominy-- succinctly points up the moral hypocrisy that has always existed within any given culture or society, and which will continue to exist so long as there are social institutions and structures to support them.  And the possible consequences of such diverse perspectives and attitudes, when zealously pursued, are effectively personified in the character of Maffio Venier (Oliver Platt), in whom we find the ultimate manifestation of moral decay, masked by platitudes of self-serving righteousness.  Herskovitz also effectively uses the relationship between Veronica and Maffio-- initially a mutually agreeable rivalry; a contest of words which later turns aggressively ugly-- as a reflection of how readily one facet of society will turn on another if but afforded the appropriate circumstances.  It's a film that works well on a number of levels, as on one hand it's a love story, while on the other it's an insightful dissertation on the inherent imperfections of society, and the fragile moral fiber that holds it together.	In the title role, McCormack gives a solid performance; that Veronica is beautiful is obvious, but most importantly, McCormack conveys her intelligence, as well, and it makes her character three-dimensional and quite convincing.  Interestingly enough, Veronica is a sympathetic character for whom, nevertheless, you do not necessarily feel sorry; and perhaps it's because she carries herself so well and has such a strong sense of `victory' about her, hiding any vulnerability that would make her susceptible to pity.  This is a woman who takes the detritus life throws at her and makes something of it-- and she does it with dignity.  If her life is morally compromised, it is not due to any acquiescence on her part, but rather the need and the will to survive.  This is a complex character who has to tread a number of fine lines, and McCormack plays it beautifully and believably.	As Marco, Sewell hits his stride and turns in an excellent performance, as well.  Marco is something of a pivotal character, in that Veronica's response to him and their relationship becomes the most telling expression of the effects of the courtesan life on her.  And as the story unfolds, Sewell does a nice job of developing his character, finally achieving a depth of emotion that significantly heightens the impact of the climax. 	In supporting roles, both Platt and Bisset give notable performances, too.  Platt once again demonstrates that he is one of the best character actors in the business; and not only is Bisset exemplary in the role of Paola, but the casting of her and McCormack as mother/daughter was inspired.	The supporting cast includes Moira Kelly (Beatrice), Naomi Watts (Guila), Fred Ward (Domenico), Joanna Cassidy (Laura), Peter Eyre (The Doge), Justine Miceli (Elena), Carla Cassola (Caterina), Michael Culkin (The Bishop) and Charlotte Randle (Francesca).  As Michael Corleone said at one point, `We're all a part of the same hypocrisy;' and if there's a lesson to be learned from `Dangerous Beauty,' it's that one should not deign to pass judgment on another without first walking in that person's shoes.  It also reminds us of the necessity of maintaining a proper perspective-- and keeping in mind that what's acceptable today may not be acceptable tomorrow.  8/10.        	 "},{"Title":"Overrated as a historical drama, underrated as a guilty pleasure","Date":"17 July 2005","Score":"32 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" To call Dangerous Beauty an adaptation of Margaret Rosenthal's The Honest Courtesan is beyond insulting to Ms. Rosenthal &#150; it's bewildering, quite frankly. The Veronica Franco depicted in Rosenthal's rather scholarly and unsentimental biography was a feminist heroine and a rather unusual figure for her or any time. Veronica Franco in Herskowitz's pretty romance novel is anything but a feminist heroine, for all the Lifetime channel rhetoric.First, a few historical corrections. According to Ms. Rosenthal's scholarship, Franco's meeting with Henri III (then King of Poland, not yet of France and not there at request of the Doge) was more important to her poetry than Venetian politics or her sex life, her trial before the inquisition was quite different, her relationship with the Veniers was far more professional and her life in general was far less dependent on men, let alone a man. Henri III was traveling through Venice when Franco entertained him at her home and may well have slept with her. However, the relationship seemed more courtly than sexual &#150; Franco even gave him gifts on his departure, two sonnets and a miniature. What Rosenthal remarks on are the sonnets she wrote in tribute to Henri in true (masculine) court style and the likelihood that Franco was trying to collaborate with other poets on a book in the future King of France's honor. Franco's poems on the event were courtier's poems and not love poems; in fact, she pulled of the rather difficult task of using the story of Jupiter and Danae as a model for her poems and undermining the eroticism her contemporaries (men) highlighted when using that myth. Franco often reclaimed overly sexualized female figures and made them into civic, public figures &#150; a pity that Herskowitz and script writer Dominy do the reverse to Franco.Franco's trial before the inquisition wasn't the maudlin thing it was in the movie, either. It wasn't even public and her accuser was a disgruntled and unpaid tutor, claiming she participated in rituals and other rites in her house. Veronica got out of it basically by admitting to allowing her servants to have these rituals and participating in them at times, but she never believed in it and it wasn't a sin or demonic if one didn't believe in it. She was hardly the only person to be pulled before the inquisition at the time &#150; Domenico Venier, her patron, was also brought before the inquisition because of a servant. Rather than having to defend her sexual behavior, she was in the position many men found themselves in. Their financial or employment practices irked a servant and the servant accused them of heresy. Unsexy as it is, Veronica's trial could be more easily compared to Martha Stewart's trial than to the sentimental theatrics in Herskowitz's film.Historically speaking, there is no reason to believe that Marco and Veronica were as close as the film shows. They were friends and fellow poets with great respect for the each other's work, certainly, and quite possibly lovers. Veronica had many lovers, though, and she did not ride off to some 'happily ever after' with Marco at all. There were other lovers she seemed to be more passionate about, including those who fathered some of her children, also left out of the film.So, as a historical drama it fails because it ignores historical fact and I think it fails even more as a feminist revision. I don't think Franco's story needs any revisionism to be feminist, and certainly not of this kind. When the heroine is more than happy to commit herself entirely to a man who has no qualms about publicly humiliating a wife who never injured him and sees nothing wrong with demanding Veronica's fidelity without offering his own, I can't consider her a feminist role model. When a film cheerfully sets up a dichotomy between the sexually adventurous but ultimately submissive mistress and the frigid, demanding wife, I can't call the film exactly a paragon of feminist values, especially when the mistress wins out. Why was there no sympathy for Guilia, who seemed quite unhappy with her lot and had no way out? Why no pretty speech about perpetual inconsequence for her, especially when she's the one is consigned to that more than any of the others. Apparently, if a woman isn't ready to be cheerfully sexually accessible to a man who can afford her, she doesn't deserve decent and respectful treatment from her husband. How this is a liberating message escapes me.The only level this film does work is as a guilty pleasure, and on that level it's fantastic. The cast is pretty, the set is pretty, the costumes are pretty, the music is pretty (if a bit sentimental and overpowering) and if you don't think about it too hard, it's a nice fairy tale. Had they not tried to base this on real people and had they deleted the ridiculous, Maxim-friendly just-do-me-feminism, it would have been a satisfying romance novel of a film. However, in trying to give this substance, they made it at best vaguely offensive.

Few of the scenes seem like they are something that would have gone down quite the way the film tells us they did. It's just too far from reality. I'm not totally against films being unreal, or fantastical; But to me it just doesn't work well when you claim that you are telling a true story, but then most of the film is filled with scenes that don't really feel like they are portraying real characters and situations. This film feels more like a cartoon version of Venice circa the late 1500's, early 1600's. Nothing really fits quite right in this film despite the good story, and even at times despite some good dialogue. There are better versions of Fanny Hill out there that are comparable to this, and certainly more believable.I'm sure this is one of those rare case of where a film about a prostitute is actually more appealing to women, then to men. Like another well known film of this sort, Pretty Woman, the film mixes prostitution with romance, which to me is not a problem at all if it's pulled off well. Unfortunately it just isn't pulled off that well in this case.

Get it at Amazon.)Yes, and Santa Claus is coming to town. And there is somewhere a woman true and fair.Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), a woman with a venerable family name but no cash, learns the oldest profession from her mother after experiencing the considerable shock of seeing a young woman in the nunnery (her first choice since she can't marry the man she loves) getting her golden locks shorn. No danger of that for Veronica, whose mane flows free even when she might dress down a little to hide from the hoi polloi, who are blaming her sinful ways for the plague that visits 16th Century Venice.Rufus Sewell plays nobleman Marco Venier who loves her but must marry someone else for the good of the family fortune. He plays the role like a caddy to McCormack, which is the way men appear in romance novels. McCormack herself gives only a workman-like performance that cannot lift this historical romance above the usual paperback issue. (We really needed Kate Winslet, but perhaps she read the script.) The rather routine indictment of the Inquisition and soft revelations of the hypocrisy of the Venetian nobility can't disguise the fact that this is a women's fantasy-fulfillment indulgence all the way and nothing more. The movie is also political correct in the tiresome manner of the 1990's, when women must be shown as triumphing over men through the sheer power of their cleverness and superior moxie, or, put another way, through having bigger balls.Once again Hollywood celebrates the high class whore as being ahead of her time. We see her gain admiration and riches as she develops a worldly sophistication second perhaps only to that of the Pope. Yet there is some truth to this stale notion. To make it work though, we needed to see Veronica's seamy side, to experience the crudity of her lascivious and exploitive nature. Instead we have a fairy tale princess whore, Snow White turning tricks in gorgeous gowns sans syphilis, sans beatings, sans pimp. Jacqueline Bisset is competent as the mother who teaches her daughter how to exploit men. As a pep talk she tells Veronica that courtesans are the best educated women, and you are following in the footsteps of Cleopatra. I think the historical fact (if fact it is) that the only women who were allowed to read in 16th century Venice were courtesans, confused the designers of this tale into thinking that courtesans were the superior ladies of Venetian society. They were the only women allowed in the library because they were considered already corrupted. The whole movie suffers from this sort of gee whiz this is so eye-opening for our times treatment. The climactic scene before the Inquisition in particular is embarrassing in the melodramatic naiveté of its phony development. Hollywood is again attempting to re-write history in light of the current PC agenda. Alas, however, wasn't it always thus?

From sword fights, war, and gratuitous breasts for the guys to romance, medieval dresses, and Venice for the ladies.

It's not that the movie is confusing; there has to be at least an attempt at complexity for that. It's that the characters act in such a senseless way that there's no way to imagine any real person doing what they do (in spite of the scene-setting opening paragraph that tells us that this REALLY DID HAPPEN).The baseline is that Dangerous Beauty tries really hard to be a good drama about defying society, convention, and women's gender roles.  Problem is that it turns out being a bad melodrama about following society's rules and staying behind a man.  Dangerous Beauty got a 2.  That includes an extra point because they tried so hard.

Catherine McCormack in this movie is truly every man's wildest fantasy... she can recite poetry, swordfight, is bookish smart... Oh, and she's pretty good between the sheets too. Of course her major drawback is she's a courtesan (A sort of high class prostitute) so I'd have to share her with around 100 other men. But never mind... I'm sure we could reach some kind of arrangement. Come to me, my pretty. I hope you like cats and Wispa bars.Set in the 16th century in a very decadent Venice, it tell of the rise and decline of the beautiful city, where unbridled pleasure was interrupted by war and the eventual arrival of religious fanatics, which saw all harlots guilty of witchcraft. It wasn't the best period to be a female, as your sole purpose seemed to be either a breeding machine or a household slave. But those beautiful enough had another option Service the rich and powerful in their every sordid desire, and you got inundated with gifts and invited to lots of lavish parties as well as living like a queen. That is, until your looks faded...This had me involved from the start, helped no doubt by the gorgeous heroine but also by the host of other delightful characters, including Rufus Sewell as her unattainable true love from a higher station, and Oliver Platt as his cousin, who moves to the God Squad after a bit of brainwashing.

Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love.This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of girl teen empowerment movie in more than one scene.The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love.The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.

The 'jovial' verbal sparring that goes on between Veronica and Platt's character is trite, and with clumsy innuendos. The sexual fascinations the men of Venice have with Veronica comes off as somewhat artificial, and Veronica herself, doesn't seem like such a dangerous beauty. The emphasis for power and intelligence in courtesans is quite clear in the film, but apart from showing her reading a couple of books, this doesn't come across. The exchange between Veronica and King Henry was set up to be challenging, and interesting, and then too easily resolved. The conclusion between Marco and Veronica's characters ripped right out of a Harlequin romance, and not given any sort of punch to make it favorable. I was hoping that Veronica would truly be strong, and assert herself as a powerful woman, but her weaknesses and what she gave into demeans this. And Paola, her mother, was quite shocking and somewhat incredulous. The film tries to explain her motives for pushing Veronica to become a courtesan, but the training session sequence still leaves an uneasy feeling about her.I sound quite unforgiving towards the film, so here I admit there were some good moments. Veronica explaining the not so glamorous part of a courtesan's life. The court scene (though the conclusion was still a mite too easy) held some power the rest of the film should have. Veronica's interactions with Domenic. And the Minister Rimbarti was a very sympathetic character and he stood out in the scenes he was in.So all in all, it's okay to watch, but if you're expecting something that actually has meaning look somewhere else.

It does an effective job of taking back to another time, place and mores. How you chose to judge the subject matter and your thoughts is another matter but my quibbles with the film are with the film-making.This is somewhat of a spoiler but the film somewhat abruptly changes greatly from its first appearance and tone as a light, frothy *Shakeapeare in Love*- like movie to something much darker.While Catherine McCormack is a beautiful woman and it?s understandable why men fall under her spell in Venice of that time, for us, she occasionally slips into the 20th century in her performance. She?s fine but we?re not quite convinced. Remember her in Braveheart? The cute, slight and doomed *girl* love interest of William Wallace? Then remember when Sophie Marceau walked on screen - all woman? That?s how it is in this film. She?s beautiful but slight in regards to her presence on screen.Part of the problem is the script tries to be more clever than it is - for instance there is a *poetry-slam* contest that we keep hoping it?s going to get clever, funny or poignant but it never does.

He must have appeared in some 10 films this year and the year is only half way through. Rufus is a throwback to the glory days of Gainsborough pictures when James Mason, Stewart Grainger, Michael Rennie et al caused hearts to throb in period dramas as they swirled their capes, drew their swords, fought duels, bedded wenches and in general acted like lusty MEN! Rufus Sewell saves this film from being a feminist sounding board by playing a young lover forced into an arranged marriage by the custom of the times without appearing weak and sappy. The medieaval Italians spent their time wheeling and dealing in a way that would put a Hollywood mogul to shame, and arranging marriages was part of the dealing.Catherine McCormick does a wonderful job as Veronica and the film is helped by wonderful supporting players.  I must confess that I felt sorry for the abandoned wife of Marco.For my taste, the feminist revision of history is grating.  People in those times knew the score  no one married for love and no one expected to. Veronica, being from a good, albeit impoverished, family could have married a noveau riche merchant wanting to move up by marrying into an old respected family. She became a courtesan by choice, it was in her blood, and had she not stuck her neck out and antagonised the church she would not have been hauled before the Inquisition.The film looks handsome and is worth watching twice.

I'm not sure what movie the other person was watching that they thought her name was Katherine. The actress' name is Catherine McCormack though. Anyway, Veronica Franco was a 16th century Venetian courtesan and a published poet. That was quite a feat in her day considering society thought (and still does today to some extent) that the role of women were to be wives and mothers and nothing more. They did not receive education outside of the Bible.Courtesans were an exception. Because they were companions of educated men, whether in Venice or not, they had to be educated as well. Courtesans always had a field in which they excelled outside of sex, be it philosophy, literature, history, etc. Before I saw this movie, I had the same ignorant assumption that courtesans were just higher priced streetwalkers, but they weren't. These women were brazen and they had to be to do what they did for a living. They dared to enjoy sex in a time when women weren't supposed to and spoke out when women were supposed to be silent.After seeing Dangerous Beauty, I decided to look up Veronica Franco and the histories of courtesans in general. I would ask that everyone do that instead of going on ill-informed and prejudiced views. The movie does leave out a great deal about Veronica's life, but it's a fair summary. Scenery is gorgeous as is the costuming. The acting is wonderful. What is unfortunate, if you look closely at society and consider how you react to things of a sexual nature, not much has changed from those times.

Unfortunately, the screen writing does not do justice to the material. For one thing, the character of Veronica Franco does not appear to have many qualms about her choice to become a courtesan throughout the course of the film, where one would expect that in that era, it would be a very difficult and humiliating choice for a woman to make. While the positive aspects of being a courtesan are justly portrayed, the negative aspects are glossed over or neglected. Another serious problem is the lack of a negative response to this choice on the part of close friends as well the man who loves her. There are occasional moments when the social ostracism she would have been treated to in real life at the time are shown, but initially there does not appear to be any negative social consequences to this choice, and indeed even the man who loves her doesn't seem to care what she has become. The film ought to have more seriously and honestly explored his reaction to her choice, as well as her own. It would have made it a far more dramatic, and more relevant film. As it is, the film is far too lighthearted for the serious nature of the subject matter. The screenwriters failed to take full advantage of the depth of the inherent drama to the story, and instead made it almost a comedy. It does have some redeeming qualities. The film is beautifully shot, the costumes are excellent, and it's nicely paced. It isn't badly directed, but again, I feel that a more serious handling by the director could have made up for the deficiencies in the script.In summary, this is a light entertainment movie that doesn't do justice to the weight of the underlying subject matter.

This cannot be said for Dangerous Beauty which I only discovered 13 years later. I watched it after seeing Braveheart again and being captivated by the character played by Catherine McCormack. In fact I seeked out other titles that included her presence and I am so happy I did.Dangerous Beauty is a wonderful love story that is told with such incredible passion. I know the film is taken from true characters and much of the story is as well from history. I doubt however that the true accounts could come close to the romantic story that is unveiled here. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell were magic together and no matter the subject matter or the kind of life that Veronica Franco was dealt, their love remained true and intense throughout the film.Even now, several days after seeing it, I continue being haunted by the two soulmates and especially cannot forget the last 15 minutes when both characters profess their love to each other and the world while on trial.Anyone who is a romantic at heart would love this movie.

Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell are absorbing as the two citizens of Venice tied by love, but separated by their class. Oliver Platt, Jacqueline Bisset, and Fred Ward shine in their supportive roles and give credence to a lovely, romantic story.The only drawback that I can see has nothing to do with the movie, and everything to do with historic fact. After watching the movie I found myself curious about the life of Veronica Franco, because she is portrayed so strongly by Catherine McCormack. I found that Franco was indeed interrogated by the Inquisition, not only once but twice. Also, she faced the council alone, with only her wits to save her. After watching the movie a second time, I feel that even with the strong performance this movie might not have done justice to such an amazing woman like Veronica Franco.Even so, I rate it very highly and would encourage any adult to watch it. There are some nude scenes, with sexual acts performed, so this is definitely not a movie for children. However, the love story is touching and the history behind the story is fascinating.

Married women were treated as property and locked away by their husbands. They were kept ignorant, had only their religion for comfort, and their main responsibility was to reproduce and deliver heirs for the future of the dynasty.Against this dull and depressing world stands the world of the courtesans. Beautiful, educated women, similar to those in ancient Greece, socialise with the men of wealth and power, sing and dance for them, recite poetry, and of course fulfil their sexual desires. As reward they are respected, wealthy, enjoy education and personal freedom and engage in politics. However, they must forsake marriage and a respectable family life.The story concentrates on one woman, who chooses the life of a courtesan, since her family is to poor to provide the dowry for the marriage to the love of her life, a young Venetian senator, who loves her back with the same desperate intensity. As a courtesan, she becomes very influential in the upper circles of Venice, mingles with the clergy, with politicians and generals, becomes a famous poetess, publishes her work as books. Finally, at a crucial point in the history of Venice, it is she who persuades the French king to help out with his fleet in a naval struggle against the Turks.Alas, as always, things turn sour, when the plague comes to Venice, thousands die, and the people are looking for a scapegoat. The holy inquisition is summoned, and the courtesans play the role of the Christians in the Rome under Nero. In a show trial, our heroine is accused of witchcraft, and has to face the wrath of Catholicism against educated women, and the hatred and jealousy of the pious wives of Venice.

To become a person of status herself, and make money doing so, her mother teaches her to become a courtesan, a sort of well respected, high class, prostitute.

It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted.Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition.While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened.Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity. "},{"Title":"Film about a strong woman and a comparison to the book","Date":"2 August 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":" When I wrote the following review, I had not read the book on which it is based. Since then I have. The book is a non-fiction book about main character and her time. I liked it but it is not historical fiction. I wouldn't recommend it unless you like scholarly non-fiction in feminist studies. The film claims to be a true story, but it really isn't. Not that much is known about Veronica Franco's life particularly the first part of it. There can be conjecture, of course, but the claim of it all being true is somewhat ambitious. Here is my original reviewThis film shows the methods a strong and intelligent woman might use to control men while making them feel as if they are in control of her. It shows women being witty, well educated, responsible and cleaver - often more so than men. Such would naturally appeal to many who find few cleaver women represented in modern films. The production values are good and there is an abundance of spectacle. Venice, itself, is a fascinating and exotic city. Filming there with a good crew and excellent costumes is sure to please and this film comes through in that department. Don't underestimate the value and pleasure of a well shot and costumed film. Many people go to films just to see such things. Even history buffs love to see a film that tries to represent what it must have been like at the timeThe film gets weaker when it comes to the script. Not that the script is bad, at times it is cleaver, but the plotting is predictable. The film claims to be a true story, because it was taken from an biography. Assuming the film is faithful to the biography, there are so many improbable things in the film that I would have to question how truthful the author was. (For example a mother raises her family to adulthood, and they do not know that she was once a famous courtesan in the very town they are living in.) Also it is difficult to imagine how Veronica on her first experience as a courtesan could come out with witty and bawdy poetry done off the cuff to an audience of nobles, when she had previously lived a cloistered existence perfecting her manners. Yes, she had had practice writing poetry, but not BAWDY poetry. Such things weaken the plot but they do not have to be fatal to the film. they are not major flaws and a film overcome them with strong acting, tight pacing and well handled dramatic moments.The acting, however, is not the best, and the pacing can sometimes be rather slow - much like the kind of pacing you would see on TV. If you are someone who wants acting that rings true, tight pacing and well handled drama, then this film will not appeal to you. History has been full of interesting, powerful and capable women. Women who have had incredible influence over men in the highest of positions, and women who have held those high positions without the aid of men. It was a woman, after all, who may have been history's most brilliant General - Joan of Arc. Yet it seems a surprise to many that a movie would dare to show that there were such women in history. If you like this movie, I recommend you start reading some history. There is a lot of it that is well written. Historical fiction is also interesting but real history is the best. In fact I think I will pick up a copy of The Honest Courtesan on which this film is based. For you see, I am one of those people who wants tight pacing, good acting and well handled drama. While I was disappointed in the film, I have a feeling that I might like the book much better.

I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in Braveheart. I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film.McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly).Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian bodice-ripper to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films.A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).

Incredible quotes and one-liners ( ... the living hell of being condemned to a life of perpetual insignificance says Veronica's friend, now safely married but shut away as she asks Veronica to teach her daughter the skills needed to become a courtesan). The brain candy when Veronica and the slovenly court poet get into verbal dueling. I will never tire of those scenes. And the costumes - had to go back and see it once again just for the detail and fabric and lush sensuality of the garb. And in the end, it is simply a morality tale.

Like the Garry Marshall film, Dangerous Beauty is the story of a woman who is instructed by her mother how to learn the social skills necessary to improve her stage in life. Only this time it takes place in renaissance Italy and the skills she learns is how to be a courtesan which is a high class prostitute. Predictably, there are several (more than 5) montages showing her progress in learning her craft and plying it.Most insulting to the viewer's sensibilities is that every one of her clients is good looking and a gentleman with the exception of the King of France. He's a sadistic tyrant who she quickly dominates and lures into supporting Italy in war. This is no spoiler. As with most TV movie style plots the outcome is seen well in advance of them happening. And like a TV movie, this film lacks tension as to any conflict and peril the characters face; you know in the end they'll be okay.To be brief, Dangerous Beauty is a made for TV movie with a big budget. It is very reminiscent of the movies made for Lifetime.Although it is well cast and shot on location in Venice the story is simplistic and adolescent in its viewpoint.I gave it 3 out of 10.  "},{"Title":"Dangerous Beauty is stupid propaganda","Date":"16 August 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Dangerous Beauty pretends to be the story of real-life 16th-century Venetian courtesan Veronica Franco.  In reality, it is an attempt to rewrite history to suit the wishful thinking of pseudo-feminist ideology.I have no objection to making a professional prostitute the heroine of the story.  The contempt that society, then and now, showers on such women while excusing the men who pay them for their services is rank hypocrisy.  And it is true, just as the movie claims, that many Venetian courtesans became wealthy, well-educated, and independent women.  The nightmare of drug addiction, violence and de facto slavery to a pimp that is prostitution in modern America was not true of prostitution in all places and times.The movie still glamorizes the profession far beyond what the historical record will support.  The historical Veronica Franco suffered frequently from the occupational diseases of prostitutes, but this Veronica is always hale and hearty.  Hilariously, we also discover that 16th-century Venice has already invented a safe, effective morning-after pill, enabling Catherine McCormack to avoid the real Veronica Franco's numerous pregnancies. Still, if Dangerous Beauty had done no worse than this, it could still have been enjoyable, if silly, for these historical absurdities do not amount to gratuitous slanders against Veronica's non-courtesan contemporaries.Much worse is the pretense that prostitution was women's only path to education and influence in Renaissance Italy.  Excuse me, but Isabella d'Este and Beatrice Sforza might have a word or two to say about that. Read Castiglione's `Il Cortigiano' and you will see that educated women were a staple of Renaissance Italy's upper crust; poorer women remained uneducated, of course, but so did poorer men.  Indeed, Castiglione was careful to include education as one of the attributes of the ideal female courtier.The movie further kicks marriage in the teeth; a married woman expresses envy for Veronica's position and bemoans that being a wife is a `state of perpetual inconsequence.'  Merely because women (not just wives) were unconscionably mistreated in that age, we are expected to swallow the idea that the woman who ran the household and raised, moulded and educated the children, and who could not be divorced without an expensive and hard-to-get dispensation from the Pope, was less `consequential' than a prostitute men used and forgot the next week.Still more disgusting is the movie's attempt to disparage love itself.  I have no personal moral objections to prostitution when one willing person sells her body to another willing person, it may be considered an offense against God, depending on your religious beliefs, but it is not an offense against people.  No person is hurt by the exchange.  But to mislabel this morally neutral commercial transaction as `love' is to do both love and prostitution a horrible injustice; it turns prostitution into a fraud while turning love into a trifle.  Veronica is presented as giving the priceless gift of `love' (for only 100 ducats a pop!) to men who are assumed to be incapable of loving the women they live with and raise children with. Well, loveless marriages have always existed, but there have always been loving ones too, even in the days when bride and groom never met before their wedding.  There was never a loving trick turned.It is not only the movie's attitude toward women that is unhealthy; its view of men is warped, too.  We are presented with that cliché that turned up in the '70s, the sexually frustrated man (Oliver Platt here) as inherently evil and malicious.  On the other hand, we are shown that sadistic rapist-murderers present no danger at all, if you know what they really want, which is to be dominated.  Why didn't the thousands of women killed by such creeps think of that?Having said all this, I must reluctantly admit that the acting by all parties is good, and the sets and costumes beautiful.  If you think that excuses this movie's lying in an evil cause, you're wrong.  Leading man Rufus Sewell had the honesty to admit that this movie was unadulterated horse manure.  Better that the rest of us admit it, too.Rating * out of ****.Recommendation Unless you're writing a thesis on pseudo-feminist distortions of history, give this movie a wide berth.

But this is NOT history, it's 1990s melodrama, lush costumes filmed through a post-modernist lens.17th century Venetian society was decadant, ribald, immoral to the point of not caring, and most importantly for the film, was not that unkind to women. Venetian society had evolved in such a way that the married women spent most of their time with their professional valet lovers, fildelity was a joke, men and women had the same access to a buffet of vices.There was, simply, little by way of polite society, no reason for men and women to restrain themselves. So they didn't. McCormmick's character was delicious (and kudos to her, a major star in the making) but the story, to me, toyed with the audience's sympathies, built our like for the main character at the expense of conveying the world in which she lived.The film, to sum up, was Pretty Woman for the Merchant-Ivory crowd.

Yet, the critics generally reviewed it unfavorably, writing in some cases that the film was unrealistic and based on a novel.  I've now read the book. Many of the key elements in the movie are in the book, which, in turn, is validated by 16th century manuscripts available today in museums in Italy.I have seen the film three times.  My first impression was quite favorable, but I wasn't quite sure why.  Subsequent viewings focused my attention to the acting of Catherine McCormick.  She is entirely believable in several very different phases of the life of Veronica Falco.  First, she is an innocent and even pious young woman, with an immaculate reputation to guard. She falls madly in love and is loved in turn, but is then shattered to discover that she can not marry the man she loves (who will eventually have an arranged marriage).  To support her family, she ultimately becomes a courtesan.  Her second phase is that of a bumbling, but improving courtesan trainee.  She relishes the educational element (Courtesans are among the best educated people in the world; in contrast, other women have little or no education). She completes her training and then begins her career as the third phase, clumsy at the start, but rapidly becoming sophisticated in several ways.  She develops a flair for poetry, both spontaneous verbal and written for a book.  With a female author, the book is unique for this period in Venice. She understands the politics of the day and even uses her skills to persuade King Henry of France and Poland to support a war against Turkey.  She does not advocate the life of a courtesan for others, but speaks against it when a woman friend asks her to train the friend's daughter to become a courtesan so that the daughter can enjoy intellectual freedom. Finally, she is put on trial by the Inquisition for bewitching many of the leaders of Venice (all male), and defends herself with high intelligence in the face of an emotional prosecution.For me, Catherine McCormick is absolutely believable in all these phases and subphases of her role.  In the later viewings of the film, I focused on her face.  It is very expressive, an expressiveness that is very important to the film.  There were many fine actresses in the popular films of 1998, but none displayed the wide range of character given by Catherine McCormick in this film; the other roles were narrow by comparison.  The achievement is all the more remarkable because Dangerous Beauty is obviously a low-budget film, with no famous actors and the ample use of computer generated backgrounds.  I believe it to be superior to Titanic, which is far more spectacular, but not as enjoyable overall.I do not understand how the professional movie critics could give so many unfavorable reviews or why the film producers did not advertise more widely.The film music is available on CD and is very enjoyable, even to a friend who has not seen the film.I heartly recommend both film and CD.

The film includes a lot of variety, including poetry contests, a sword fight, a war all the men have to go off to, and a plague that gets blamed on the courtesans.The climax is a religious trial for heresy, where most of the powerful politicians in Venice end up standing up for her as accomplices.I rate this film a strong 8 of 10. It treats a historical subject and person in a very interesting manner and has a very satisfying ending. We must interpret true stories differently from fiction. Here we cannot try to decide whether courtesans (prostitutes) were good or evil, simply recognize that it was a legitimate career choice in 16th century Venice, and this film tells the story of one of those and does it in a very captivating manner. The photography and background music are both very good, and the DVD has DD 5.1 sound and a super-sharp picture with nicely saturated colors.

I loved the story, the romance, the beautiful photography, and the messege of integrity with being true to yourself.  This story reminded me of The Crucible 1996 with Daniel Day Lewis & Joan Allen and also the 1966 movie A Man for All Seasons except this was much better then both of those movies, it was more lively, more captivating and better written.

Brilliant, beautiful, and breathtaking.I was not previously familiar with the book 'The Honest Courtesan from which the film was based, but my assumption is that the film is in most part based on fact.  Another in the fine group of films from Ed Zwick/Marshall Herskovitz, a pair who's trendy and mainstream prime time soap Thirtysomething seems a distant memory as titles like this one, Glory, and Courage Under Fire carry their banner.Caroline McCormack is certainly going to be a huge star. She truly has the combination of beauty and intelligence that is so rare, and so valuable in film. From Braveheart to Dangerous Beauty and beyond-her future success seems destined.Films can be many things to many people, and some will choose to make social commentary, or possibly discount authenticity when looking at a film such as this. I prefer to let the beautiful images and wonderful love story engulf me and leave the microscopic inspection to another forum.To each his own, to me a wonderful movie going experience.

Catherine McCormack, (Veronica Franco),Spy Game,'01, was a young woman who fell madly in love with Rufus Sewell ,(Marco Venier),Victoria Station,'03, at a very early age. It was almost love at first sight and the couple wanted to marry and become Soul Mates in one flesh together. However, the Venetian Laws of the land dictated that this man or woman must marry into only certain rich and noble families. In other words, Marco & Veronica were not able to become man and wife as they so desired beyond your wildest dreams. Veronica is trained by her mother to become a Courteson of Venice and she proceeds to service all kinds of sex hungry men, from men in the clergy to every sort of man who wanted a one night stand. There is great acting and lots of interesting situations which all wind up in a so called Court of Law in Venice.

I had to watch it for my history of early Modern Europe class (the professor gave students the option of leaving the classroom if anyone felt uncomfortable during mature scenes...I took full advantage of it).  But it does give the viewer what life was like for a 17th century Venetian courtesan, especially Veronica Franco.  Morally speaking, it's just disgusting.  Cinematically speaking, it's marvelous.  The historical worth of the film should not go ignored due to the fact that it mirrors a great deal of material from history.

I read some of the other comments, and I can see why some people wouldn't like it. I love period pieces, and this one was great. The only things that could have made it better were 1> Kate Winslet (corset Kate) and 2> LOSING OLIVER PLATT!!! He sucked thru the whole movie. I wanted to see this for a while, but I wasn't able to while it was still in theatres. I thought it was great on DVD. I really liked the fact that it was based on the true story of a 16th century courtesan. Yes, they were high class prostitutes, but they were cherished women. A different kind of love than you would give the wife of an arranged marriage, but loved beyond control all the same. If you love period pieces, RENT THIS TODAY! You wont regret it. I promise.

If you thought the chick from Braveheart was hot and always wondered what she would look like au natural....this movie is for you.

The scenery looked fake half the time and the acting was atrocious. Ok, so the guy rejects her and she becomes a courtesan? Please, she degraded herself to become educated? Was it really that serious? I found Veronica's character annoying. She was mousy, then all of a sudden she's the whore of Venice; the star tourist attraction literally. Regardless of whether this was a true story or not, it was dumb. There are no other words to describe it. I can't believe Jacqueline Bisset did this movie. She had like 10 minutes total! Sewell is one of God's most unattractive creations since the aardvark, and he's supposed to be the man she's all googly-eyed for? Please! This movie was bearable because of Oliver Pratt. He's a great and versatile actor. Their battle scenes were the only interesting part because he merely said what I was thinking. She's a disgusting prostitute with no sense of love at all. Her testimony at the end was completely lost on me because she confused female sensuality with her reason for becoming a courtesan in the first place. Yes, it's a gift, but not to give around like that. It was a cheesy Romantic-drama-blah blah blah. I don't even see the point of making it.

It was, in effect, one of your Nora Roberts Romance novels brought to screen with a huge budget. Good acting, nice look. It's a pretty film to look at, but the plot is weak and shallow, and the historical accuracy is slim to none. It had it's moments though. About...two. The deep-throating of a banana and the poetry duel. That's about it. Again, very pretty to look at, the costumes were almost historically accurate.Spoiler - I was fine with the movie, even started to like it, until she got back with the guy who dumped her. That was when I walked out.I give it a one out of ten.

The lead actress is very pretty, in a wispy blond sort of way, but has no trace of the kind of charisma you would expect she would need to be the leading courtesan of her day, one who could talk her way out of the Inquisition.       For most of the film, there's no conflict to speak of - every sinister turn of the plot has its teeth pulled.  Prostitution is made to look like a tourist magazine version of a luxury honeymoon.  The Inquisition are a bunch of stuffed scarecrows.The lavish costumes and sets convey hardly any feeling of Renaissance  Venice.  The actors all have a modern, American air in their look and manner.  Only Rufous Sewell looks the least bit Italian.  The French king looks and acts ridiculously British.   We are trotted through turn after turn of the plot with no effort to convince us that any of it is real.Each scene seems borrowed from a different costume drama, and all the characters' motivations, too.  The final insult was the heresy trial. The weakest sibling yet of all movie heresy trials!  I suppose this is a feminist parable, but I think any credit you gain by proposing that a prostitute is a heroine of liberty, you lose by being as santimonious about it as the priests that retire in defeat at the end.I guess I like movies with more grit.

The protagonist essentially plays a 20th century woman through whom we as the audience are supposed to see the plight of women in the old world.  This is revisionist history at its best.  There is also some very bad theology in the movie, which encourages us to sin so what we might experience the mercy of God.

A Destiny Of Her Own is a plea for prostitution.Hollywood can add all sorts of bells and whistles, in this case rapturous applause from her former enemies (in concert with swelling orchestral music) as the argument turned, but surely not many of you will be able to buy this particular pivotal scene. In plague ridden Venice this woman would have surely burnt, as horrible as that would have been.But A Destiny Of Her Own does have its attractions. For those of you who enjoy romance, soft lenses, warm lights and loving looks then this film might sate you a little, if you like your films pretty and predictable. Not much blood is spilt, at least not on screen.  (If you're happy to ignore the many thousand of plague victims the last reel of the film uses for dramatic tension.)The screwed up religiosity of the Inquisition gets a bit of a serve. No biblical hell could be worse than a state of perpetual inconsequence,'' is just one of a number of pretty tasty lines delivered in a film that takes some delight in verbal sparring. But on the other hand, an otherwise good looking movie is spoilt by a number of obviously fake panoramas which are meant to be old time Venice.The whore Katherine is played with some verve by Catherine McCormack; Braveheart's wife in Mel Gibson's film. Her loved one in A Destiny Of Her Own is played by Cold Comfort Farm's big eyed, curly haired Rufus Sewell. The still lovely Jacqueline Billet plays Katherine's mother, who when she was young enough was also a courtesan.Much is made of the fact that for these women being a courtesan was a very attractive career choice. These women, being the playthings of the rich, were often highly educated, could become powerful in politics and certainly materially much better off than women who weren't highly born.That's all well and good but I wasn't convinced in A Destiny Of Her Own that even Katherine could have convinced her clients' women to have her spared from the flames.

I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive.I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot. I really feel cheated and I want the time back that was wasted. "}]
