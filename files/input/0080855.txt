[{"Title":"THE CENTURY'S MOST UNDERRATED FILM","Date":"13 September 1999","Score":"151 out of 206 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":"  I saw Heaven's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece The Deerhunter. The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business. The film at that time cost about 40 million dollars (now considered low budget) making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film. The Deerhunter had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias building up against Cimino.                        At the time I thought the film was very good and when I saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so. The film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990's. They were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print. Nevertheless, seeing the film years later I now thought Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version started to appear in a few select cities, I got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on. Despite the mandate Joseph Cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club. The film flashes ahead 20 years to Johnson County in Wyoming. A cattle company called the Stockholders Association has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson sides with the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it.                             A massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves. A United States Cavalry comes to the rescue of the Association  to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his Harvard days married, bored, on a yacht, living but dead on the inside.This is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it's themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set designs, and acting.   Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston, and Cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters. Some of the major complaints I read about this film state that is ugly to look at, incoherent, too long, that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible.             In its defense, Heaven's Gate has the look of photographs of that period just as McCabe & Mrs. Miller did. Some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality.(The critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot.) But in spite of all that, the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable.                                                     The film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it.  Everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes. As to its length, it is a beautifully structured piece,  at times moving, poetic, exhilarating, or devastating with virtually one great scene following another. At times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity. But one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language, the glances between characters or their actions. One day soon this film should be re-released in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles- under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the  kinds of great films he is capable of making.

Yet 'Heaven's Gate', seen today at last on DVD in a cut of 229 minutes, is a superb film. It is a touch lethargic in pace. But at least it is paced. Quite apart from the incompetence of construction that marks many films today, there have been many films which, deliberate in form, have been severely damaged by being hacked down with no care for rhythm so the films become shapeless and confusing. Beyond this, the criticisms leveled at the film have become in retrospect quite lame. If the good guys and bad guys are too obviously pronounced for a serious film, and yes Sam Waterston's mustachioed, fur-clad villain is comic-opera (and not in the multi-leveled manner of Bill The Butcher from 'Gangs of New York'), and yes, the townsfolk do seem a touch 'Fiddler On The Roof' on occasions, then a few dozen serious films made since then, including 'Titanic' and the graceless 'Cold Mountain' (which bears certain similarities and is a notable failure in convincing qualities compared to this film) can be castigated for exactly the same reason. Also despite accusations, the film has a plot, quite a well-essayed plot at that. It simply does not bow to standard-form 'epic' quality, by providing Titan heroes, rafts of sub-plots and confusion. It experiments with telling in a manner more like much smaller, modest films, by carefully-caught moments of character interaction, and well-textured pageant-like explosions of communal action, as with the opening at Harvard and, most specially, the wonderful scene where the Johnson County folk, following the lead of a brilliantly physical fiddler, make celebration on roller-skates.'The Deer Hunter' was a critical and commercial success but abandoned the first half's inspired, mosaic-like accumulation of detail, and I think in a manner similar to criticism of Robert Penn Warren's novel 'All The King's Men' and its dictionary of Jacobean stunts, if Cimino had not had such a strong grasp of the conventions of Hollywood epics, he might have made a special rare work of art based in honest visualisation of people within their milieu. In contrast, 'Heaven's Gate' succeeds in screwing its narrative momentum and tension upwards in a slowly expanding arc, until the finale explodes, whilst not abandoning the mosaic approach.The central romantic triangle, for instance, resists standard inflections; a decent, intelligent, but psychically defeated man, James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) competes with a hot-shot but identity-challenged young gunman Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) for the hand of a young Madame, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); there is no self-conscious bed-hopping, no slaps in the face, recriminations, or typical sad-sack moments, but more a sad and distanced decision by Ella to choose the younger man whom she loves less because he is ready to make the commitment. Ella emerges as the film's true hero (Huppert's performance, though initially awkward, is really quite excellent, balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hard-hammered spirit), attempting first to rescue Nate and then mustering the resistance party of immigrants into an enterprising defence. Subsequently, Averill is stung into action as friends die. Indeed, in the process of overcoming so many traps of clich√© and style, 'Heaven's Gate' successfully and willfully throws off the defeated outsider-heroes grace note of so many '70s Westerns and portrays an eventual, vigorous, cheer-the-heroes rallying to a compromised but still relished victory. The social conflict of so many '70s Westerns at last hardens into a fully-fledged war; where capital attempts a crushing final victory over the miscreants who stand in their way, suddenly they find a massed and more-powerful people's army, led by the man who played the thoroughly-destroyed Billy the Kid a decade before. This is what led the film to be described as the first Marxist Western, but really it simply deflowers a theme of the genre extant well before the '60s. Such various and classic old-school works as William Wyler's 'The Westerner', and even 'Shane', tell awfully similar stories. It is simply here that the romantic myth of the gunslinger has been replaced by the romantic myth of the people's revolt. In a spectacular, exiting, but realistic and thus chaotic finale, the marauding Cattlemen's encampment is attacked, ringed by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses, writhing bodies, and gunfire. Averill puts his classical education to work finally by stealing a Roman trick and bringing the Cattlemen to the brink of annihilation before they are rescued by the Cavalry (another distinctly seditious touch, but surely not so offensive after 'Little Big Man's unrelenting depiction of Native American massacres). Really, it's hard to think of a more heroically American vision of grassroots resistance. The film's only real dead spot stands as an unnecessary coda indicating Averill's eventual relapse, a rather potted piece of tragedy. Despite then certain failings and a slow mid-section, 'Heaven's Gate' is a supreme piece of work, a genuine attempt to create a contemporary Western and a new kind of epic. If one has to still join the chorus that reckons Cimino was absurd in his behaviour on set and expenditure, it is regretfully. When, today, flops like 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash' and 'K-19 - The Widowmaker' see nearly a hundred million dollars sink down the drain, and yet a tag of infamy still hangs on this film, one ponders what exactly its grim death signified. The attempt at original style, the bawdy sexuality, the very hard-won sense of detail, the breathtaking rigor of the film-making and what is being filmed, all throw into contrast what is sorely lacking in so much contemporary Hollywood product.

Sure, it¬¥s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don¬¥t think that the people who hated Heaven¬¥s Gate really understood it. Heaven¬¥s Gate in its uncut form, much like The Deer Hunter shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled Americans in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue). Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life Averil leads in the epilogue. Also, as Michael Cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate , it is fascinating as a document of (and maybe indictment of) American life in Old West Wyoming. The dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional. Combined with great music and cinematography, the movie works like a truly poetic work of art. Granted, Heaven¬¥s Gate, with its refusal to patronize the viewer, is not for all tastes. However, Hollywood turns out so much commercial dreck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy (even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster) that Gate and Cimino really do deserve more respect.  All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind.

From other sources, I've learnt that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in New York City, after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes. So, I guess I saw the shorter version first which, at the time, I thought, was a very interesting anti-Western, if a trifle confusing...So, it was with even more interest that I finally obtained a DVD of the full-length version. I'm glad I did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic, and the critical vitriol poured on Michael Cimino was unwarranted, to say the very least.Yes, it's a long movie, but so have been many others. For example Once upon a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus restored version (1960) at 198 minutes; Gone with the Wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. So, it can't be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back, when Heaven's Gate came on the scene.But note this all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes.Not so Heaven's Gate in this narrative, the American West is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness, injustice, and poverty. And that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the Johnson County War of 1892 in Wyoming, showing how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of European immigrants accused of cattle rustling; and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities, right up to the President of the United States. For an essay on that war, with the background and what happened, there is a link at Wikipedia under Johnson County War.Very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history, and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be. Had it been a documentary, it would have been barely palatable for most; as entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous.Leaving aside the socio-political diatribe, for a moment, that Cimino launched herein, what about the narrative &#150; the story of the three main characters? Well, it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it's probably not unusual now. It's a fairly standard love triangle whereby Ella must choose between the two men, and ultimately decides upon the younger man, Nathan, who, although not above resorting to cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the older James (or Jim, as most people in the film say). For some, that part of the story threads too slowly, perhaps; in the context of the wider narrative about the war, however, it is, I think, entirely appropriate.And that war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly &#150; although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I'm certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated. A minor point and perhaps brought about when the 219-minute cut was restored? Any way you look at it, though, it hits you in the face with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war...Which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening. I'll admit that I found that to be a trifle annoying at first, even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words &#150; until I realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and, in war, it's the sine qua non of this mise-en-scene. In short, it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes...And what of the title? From Shakespeare, it refers to a figurative nearness to God and so, if you equate God with the natural world, the stunning scenery that pervades the movie &#150; and it is stunning, hauntingly equal to that of David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965) &#150; is a useful metaphor. I tend to think, however, that Cimino had something more to say, namely the idea that the brave immigrants &#150; the God-fearing salt of the earth &#150; were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom's champion.Was that Cimino's intent &#150; to gut the myth of the American West? To show how, in America, only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred, one way or another, throughout history? Is that anything new? Not really, as we all know. Where it really hurt, however, is in showing how America was not and, by implication, is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, after absorbing this narrative, we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of America have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves...

To this day we are still living through the effects from  HEAVEN'S GATE.  Although the film was made for only $36 million, back in 1980 that was a fortune.  Many films since have lost more money, but this one wrecked a respected studio.  There is no question as to where all the money went, for it is on the screen to see.  Everything was carefully detailed exquisitely down the extras' clothing.  An entire town was built in a remote area of Montana.  The film opens with a graduation sequence that takes place at Harvard in 1870, which is nicely shot and choreographed, but is completely unnecessary.  Many such scenes are scattered throughout, and the film is more than halfway over before the plot finally starts to move forward.  The actors all play characters who are one-dimensional and/or irrelevant, especially the John Hurt character.  Why Cimino needed so many extras to play the immigrants is unclear, because we never get to know any of them and they are so annoying when they gather together to plot strategies against the rich bad guys who want to kill them off.  The editing is pretty bad, but that's to be expected because there really isn't much of a story here, just a series of vignettes.  Vilmos Zsigmond's photography is good, but too often there is too much dust and smoke everywhere that obscures the characters and locations.  Also, the colors in the film are all washed out; it looks like the filmstock was left out in sun.  For example, in the middle of the roller-skating scene, the color simply vanishes, leaving only light brown and black!  Granted, there are a few things in the film that I admire, like David Mansfield's score.  Isabelle Huppert always looks sexy even without makeup.  The battle scenes are pretty exciting, although I could swear that I saw one particular wagon blow up four times.  The film has a rather odd denoument that takes place on board a ship, but everything else in this movie is pretty odd.  Why the studio didn't bring in another writer or two to rewrite the script is a mystery because inside this mess there was a good movie trying to get out.  It's a shame that Michael Cimino still hasn't recovered from this debacle.  I sure hope he makes a comeback.

I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I.  A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate.  Through it's production and release it was vilified, as no movie since Cleopatra, almost twenty years before.   At one time it was considered the most expensive over-budget movie of all time, surpassing even Cleopatra.  It was blamed for the downfall of its studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling.  Michael Cimino, fresh from his glory with the Deer Hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess, but clearly, that was petty jealousy at its worst.     Cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the American experience.  This film is not to be missed but any serious student of American filmmaking.

By the time it really gets going it seems too late. Literally nothing happens in the first 90 minutes! the film feels longer than it actually is and I've heard that originally it was meant to be released at over 5 hours. Another major problem... and I think Roger Ebert said it the best. This film opens at Harvard..continues in Wyoming and closes aboard a ship, yet there is a grim industrial pall that hangs low over everything. The film is so foggy, so smoky, so unfocused and so brownish yellow, that you feel like you want to wipe windex on the screen. A director's in very deep trouble when we don't even enjoy the primary act of looking at his movie.  I personally think that Michael Cimino is very talented. Trouble is, thanks to this film and the financial disaster that it became, he has been somewhat branded, and was never really given much control of his projects since (so I've heard). It seems too bad as I think he could have made some great American films.

I've seen it at least half-a-dozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece. So, it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that I took myself off to see the restored director's cut.To my surprise, I was disappointed on seeing it again and have since revised my estimation of the film. Heaven's Gate touches upon greatness in parts, but overall, lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great film.Firstly, two technical problems The sound quality is diffuse throughout the film, verging on inaudibility at times. Some of this, perhaps, is intentional - a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of history as it is unfolding. But at key points, one is unable to register what it is the characters are saying.The cinematography is similarly diffuse. The images lack sharpness and particularity of detail. The result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial sharpness which succeeds in blurring foreground and background.Structurally, the narrative is off-key throughout, as if Cimino can't quite make up his mind as to the effect he is after. He wanted an epic, for sure. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film sits uneasily and unconvincingly between styles, and perhaps even genres. At times it reminded me of Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' or even 'Elvira Madigan' in its languid pace and elegant scene painting. At other times it threatens to turn into a robust 'western' more akin to 'The Wild Bunch'. In fact the latter film offers an instructive reference point for an assessment of 'Heaven's Gate' as it shares the same period concern and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker yet more heroic America. This structural and thematic uncertainty isn't helped by the poor-quality script which often sounds forced and jarring to the ear. The result is an inauthentic sense of period speech. The near-greatness of Heaven's Gate resides in its set pieces. The roller skating sequence, in particular, is astoundingly beautiful, one of the most evocative scenes ever put to film.Another set piece which works very well in terms of unifying theme, mood, and setting occurs when Kristofferson and Huppert go riding in the new rig to the lake and she washes herself while he naps in the shade. The languid pacing, evocative music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story which might just lie at the heart of the film - and which could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincingly.Some critics have complained about the length of the film. This in itself doesn't bother me. A good film can't be long enough. The restored minutes are critical in restoring the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version, and they are full of pictorial interest.Perhaps the chief glory of Heaven's Gate lies in the achingly evocative soundtrack. The repeated waltz motif and its different scorings throughout(full band, guitar, solo fiddle etc,)lends a haunting quality to the foreground action and establishes a thematic consistency lacking in the narrative itself.Despite its obvious flaws, most notably the absence of a compelling narrative, there is a sense of grandeur about the film. One leaves the cinema with a rueful sense of missed greatness and a wish that Cimino could revisit the film -with the wisdom of time and hindsight, to put right what is so badly amiss.

Is it an epic adventure, a revisionist western, a character study, a snapshot of a historical period, a love story, a dramatic expose of corruption, an artful meditation on humanity? Cimino has no idea. He tries to make Heaven's Gate into all of these things, more or less failing.It's not as if he was concerned about the damage this incoherence would do to the plot, characters, pacing, etc. The bottom line is SPECTACLE. The audience is supposed to be overwhelmed; by the epic subtext, cast of thousands, artistic lighting, the sheer money apparent on the screen. But any self-respecting viewer will tell you that being overwhelmed is not the same as being entertained.Every scene presents a bare minimum of information to tell the story There's a guy. We saw him before, I think. Now he's on a train. Now he's talking to somebody. Now he's mad. And so on. We get the gist of what's going on, with little clue why or how. Not that we care anyway, the characters are all constructed as supporting players to spectacle.To make matters worse, every shot, scene, sequence, and subplot is about four times too long. There is one exception the roller skating scene, filled with such energy and cinematic prowess that it seems tacked on from another picture. That alone was worth the price of admission. Almost.Cimino has a relatively unimaginative style of direction, which appears standard on prime time TV. Yet Ciminio constantly gets lost in fetishes, which apparently are dust, trains and horses. Dust is everywhere. Everywhere. Indoors, outdoors, in the middle of grassy fields. Sometimes there's so much dust you can't even see what's going on. Whenever a train appears, we are treated to beautiful, laborious shots that clog up the storyline. There are apparently less people in Johnson County than horses, who repeatedly hog the foreground. Even in the battle sequences. In fact, the dramatic scene at the end of Part I consists of horses riding off a train, obscured by dust. I'm serious.This would be a film forgotten by time if it weren't for the titanic production misadventure that bankrupted an established movie studio, bringing the New Hollywood era down with it. Of course, JAWS and Star Wars are guilty too, but only in the best possible ways.But Heaven's Gate is a sheer mess. Not a disaster, or an ostracized masterpiece. An unguided, absolute, sheer mess. Like T.S. Elliot, This is the way the world ends/not with a bang but a whimper. It would feel a lot better if the age of the auteur that included The Graduate, Bonnie and Clyde, 2001, The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Apocalypse Now had ended with a spectacular bomb.But no.

At over 40 million bucks, Heaven's Gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure.  What really galls me the most about it is that technically it's very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it.  John Hurt's commencement speech at Harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station.  Some people seem to think Cimino intended this as a style. He didn't.  It's just bad sound recording.  The characters are not particularly well-drawn, except for the four or five leads; in the climactic battle scene, it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the good guys.  Even on that level, it's impossible to enjoy the movie.  The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the town madam is a joke, her French accent renders the whole character a fraud.  The acting is generally stiff, without any range or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad.   John Hurt's character is the only one with any swagger or vitality (although Hurt, in his 40s, playing a fresh-faced Harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous).        I guess to say that it's overlong is overkill.  The roller-skating sequence could have been easily cut, the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche, and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the Twilight Zone.   Having Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale.  Actually, those scenes in and of themselves are not bad, but Cimino has not earned the right to include them, because what he's given us as the meat of the picture IS so incompetently bad.  The editing is poor, especially in the grand battle climax. At one point, the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times.  I wish could I say something- anything- nice about this movie a great scene, a great performance, even one memorable line of dialogue, but I can't.  It is all just one big unholy mess.  About the only thing I did like was the cinematography and the Montana locations, which are stunning.  Even Cimino couldn't screw that up.  This is a long, boring, bad movie by all standards.

All part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What a drag this film is. And the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad, so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders. These people are bad... These people are good. Whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve I am beside myself. There's a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place. Long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. John Hurt's character, who is part of the overlong beginning scene, drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains. His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. And I hear everyone, even the haters of this film, talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is. I think it looks washed-out. Watch Days of Heaven if you want to see gorgeous backyards. This movie is even worse than the anti- hype. It's pointless. The epilogue, showing the main character in a yacht, was almost as dumb as the prologue. The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid it unless you love bad movies, because this is the king of them.

Too bad the Producers and Writer/Director, Michael Cimino, spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the Johnson County war was really about. A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. The cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. The entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. The peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies. The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a posse of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the TA ranch. I doubt any women took part in the siege. Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit her. The fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the WSGA.I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events, time lines, or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.The movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the Federal Government intervention in a State Government's affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by the Calvary. Some effort was made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible by the Johnson County attorney. But since Johnson county could not afford the court costs and the Governor of Wyoming, Amos W. Barber, backed the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped.Overall I think the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of running time on the DVD version.

I was lucky enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990. It was truly staggering how BAD the film was!They had a great cast, a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), magnificent scenery...so what went wrong? Three words--director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after The Deer Hunter he went out and made this god awful Western. He's not totally to blame. His previous film The Deer Hunter was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free reign to do anything. They let him all alone...and everything went wrong. The cost went barreling out of control and Cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect.First off, the sound is horrible. Entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. For instance, Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence, but I STILL have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! That's the director's fault--he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on. The story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--Cimino turns it into a massacre. There is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the prints sound that way.This garbage effectively closed down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did. This is from a guy who made Tron! A definite must-miss.There is a pretty good book called The Final Cut which details the whole disaster. This gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers--this deserves it!

I wish I could understand what those who think it's some kind of unappreciated masterpiece see in it. To me, Mr. Cimino is a director (and, let us not forget, also the writer) who cannot tell a story and does not respect his audience. This film is, after all, longer than Gone With The Wind, but - unlike that fine film - scene after scene has nothing to do with anything before or after it, the dialogue is unintelligible in many places and anachronistically modern in tone, and the whole thing is unattractively photographed in sepia, as if to say, look at me, I'm sure making a historical epic alright! With all the unnecessary crowd scenes, it's easy to see why this thing turned into a money pit.I appreciated many of the other comments on this movie here on IMDb, they hit the nail on the head. With regard to the various dancing scenes, I admit I did enjoy the one on roller skates, but can someone tell me where the orchestra was that was churning out all that high volume orchestral music on the lawn at Harvard in 1870? (Or did it just come down from Heaven?)Whatever modest talents Mr. Cimino may have demonstrated early on in his career, apparently he deteriorated into a raging egomaniac somewhere along the way. Still, this movie probably could be edited down into some kind of small character-driven film. That would be a fun computer game. I would buy Make Your Own Heaven's Gate if it ever becomes available.

After viewing I can certainly understand why it was.I have no problem with movies taking their time developing, so that we can get to know characters and really feel a part of what is going on in the film. But this film gave me the impression that director Michael Cimino felt moving things along at a snail's pace automatically makes those things happen. In spite of the epic length he had to work with, Cimino's character development is quite minimalistic, due to the sheer volume of dead space devoted to empty looks and a lack of dialogue or at least a lack of comprehensible dialogue, which is thanks to un-subtitled foreign languages or bad sound recording. The end result is another film in which we just don't care what happens to these characters, because we really know so little about them, nor are we given a reason to care for them, other than the fact that they exist.The film begins with a long and tedious set-up at Harvard, leading the viewer to believe there is going to be an important significance for this later. As it turns out, there isn't. Strangely, the relationships established in these scenes end up going nowhere. By the end of the movie, several characters, especially John Hurt's and Jeff Bridges', were so pathetically wasted in their development, I wondered why they were even in the film at all.Worst, silliest, most bizarre and utterly maddening scene the targeted immigrants decide to fight back against the band of regulators. They end up on horseback, stupidly circling around the enemy encampment like a bunch of caricatured Indians circling the wagons in an old Western serial. The only thing missing from the scene as the immigrants get picked off like ducks in a shooting gallery are those stereotypical, hysterical Indian war whoops.But that is just one example of people behaving extremely stupidly and unrealistically in this film.As someone who enjoys subtlety in a film and doesn't even mind one that is slower paced, I nonetheless found myself fast-forwarding through several non-eventful minutes of this film. Thank goodness for that technology, but it made me wonder how anybody would have had patience for even a trimmed-down version of this film when it first showed in theaters.

Moreover the original release, the long version was recently shown on TCM exposing the film, in ail probability, to its largest audience ever. I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film. Seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films I am better able to articulate why.First there is the dreaded phrase mise-en-scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. Basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. For example, a crowd extra will be given a piece of action, say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. When the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. If there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action. All of the extras do this. Then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. This is mise-en-scene. In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional.The importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the French critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a m√©tier-en-scene, even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop. An auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. The metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood.The second point is how the director, Michael Cimino, got into the position of directing films. Cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar TV commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any lists of greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. Cute for a three year old, embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned.His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, hadn't stepped in, that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I guess if one watches the film on a DVD in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive. This is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. Its like sex, at some point it just becomes a whipping. There is the opening 40 minutes, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford, it is something of a non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna tell you of most films. However the whole preface adds up to only one line- Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later&#x85; All of that time, money and effort, not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.Then there's the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. It's just so exhausting. There is just one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible, witless dialogue, which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. Of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. Overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. Seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped, it's basically painless. But don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. That's symbolic, he said, of he doesn't know which way to go. That is basically, at its kernel, the basis of every pro- Heaven's Gate critique.Watch it, if you must, but be forewarned, this is not a film whose time has come, this is a stinker which will smell for all time. HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate in the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War.

The long gaps between lines and each overwrought scene- be it a noisy town meeting or a gang rape- gives you plenty of time to think about how this could have been a two hour film, and you can spend the rest of the time finding other things wrong with it. While the actors are all pros, sometimes adding dimension to their roles, they are usually bored beyond even scene-chewing. Aesthetic pacing is one thing, but then when it occasionally gives you canned lines like the bad guy saying, 'I am the law' into the sepia mix, well, it's just fodder for MST3000. Even they'd get bored. If you see it, you'll be bored, too. It's a typical Hollywoodization of an actual historical event- in other words, here, have another love triangle with a sweet prostitute, the sheriff, and a sorta bad guy. In an ultimately failed attempt to reinterpret the western, Camino instead grabs at all the standard 70's clich√©s graphic violence that quickly becomes cartoonish, butt-naked ladies, jumpy volume shifts, and anti-heroes.

One can hardly imagine that Michael Cimino; director of the multi Oscar winning The Deer Hunter, loved his career after 1980, because it faded pretty quickly after this monumental flop. Heaven's Gate was an industrial joke, costing anywhere from $35 to $50 million from an original $7.5 million, was lambasted by the critics, made back just $2 million and sunk the United Artists studio. Naturally, it's not that bad. The critical panning was quite uncalled for, but it's still a failure, made worst by the frequent flashes of isolated brilliance that indicate that somewhere in this shapeless slug of a film, there was a slice of cinematic brilliance trying to get out. `Now why do we do anything?' Kristofferson asks at one point in the film. Cimino would have been wise to ask himself that same question, because at the end of the day, Heaven's Gate simply lacks all motivation behind both plot and characters to work satisfactorily as a whole. There's actually nothing in it that would make you cringe in disbelief. It starts well, with Kristofferson and Hurt graduating from Harvard in 1870, sniffing the promise that the future holds. 20 years later, both men are living in Wyoming; Hurt as a drunken member of the Stock Growers' Association and Kristofferson as a Johnson County Marshall (although that doesn't become apparent until hour in), who sort-of tries to help the Wyoming immigrants who are under threat from the Association. This could have been a brilliant study of the greed and ruthlessness that built the West, but instead Cimino foolishly concentrates on relatively minor details, only occasionally expanding on the story. Thus he digresses into a love triangle sub-plot between Kristofferson, prostitute Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert) and gun fighter Walken, padding out the film with irrelevant scenes and incidents that slow it down without either the plot nor characters developing at all. Who are these people? Why are they doing what they are doing? Why is Hurt now a drunkard and why does he stick with the ranchers if he opposes them? Why is Kristofferson only half-heartedly helping the immigrants? Instead of explanations we get a series of authentic scenes and incidents, without anything at all happening a roller-skating sequence, a cock fight, endless crowd scenes and the immigrants debating about what to do about the rancher's in their native tongues, so we cannot tell what on earth is going. As many critics have said, it's all too much and not enough. And when the final shootout comes, it's so immersed in smoke, dust and poor editing, that we can't see who is shooting whom.The film is certainly very beautiful with Vilmos Zsigmond's photography, David Mansfield's great score plus the massive sets certainly lend the film an authentic western feel. But much of production that added millions to the budget, like the sets Cimino had torn down and rebuilt are on screen for all of 20 seconds. The performances are generally solid, (although Walken is miscast), but again because Cimino's script is so flat, the actors do little but give one-note performances. Frustratingly, Heaven's Gate has some brilliant moments, such as an immigrant woman hauling a cart along with her dead husband on top, Walken explaining to Huppert that newspaper on his cabin walls `civilises the wilderness' and the deeply ironic and tragic final scene. All of them suggested that this could have been a great film if Cimino had concentrated more on the big picture and not just the little details. For a 3-¬Ω hour film, Heaven's Gate has an incredibly sketchy plot and characters.However at least the full version makes some sense. After the New York press panned the film and no one turned up to the commercial release, UA pulled the film from release and cut it by an hour at Cimino's request before the rest of the world saw it. The 140 minute piece of celluloid that came out four months later simply reduced an already confusing plot to a series of scenes with little or no relevance to one another, with little of Cimino's ambition shining through. The biggest irony in all this is that the film has such a great concept and so many great moments, that it begs a remake that would correct the many wrongs of the existing film. The result would be utterly superb given the right director, though I doubt whether any producer could to ever be drugged enough to give the green light.

It's a scene in which miss a single line of dialogue, and you will not get the film. It does an excellent job at setting the tone and having the audience on the edge of their seat.To say this movie moves at a slow pace is really wrong- it doesn't move at any pace at all.

I am unsure of how close it comes to reaching it's intended greatness, but I assure you, it doesn't.The plot follows like this James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) graduates from Harvard University full of youthful idealism. This opening runs for about 20 minutes. He runs to a commencement ceremony. Their are several very long speeches. One is from the university president, the other is from the class orator. These speeches say nothing, really. The writing is not very good. They tell about how they are going out to civilize a country. They are so wordy you get lost after a few seconds. Then, everyone is dancing on the lawns outside. Then, the lawns are empty again and everybody runs out of the buildings and gathers around a tree. They try to take flowers from high on the trunk, and end up punching each other for no apparent reason. We are given no explanation as to how or why they all went inside after dancing and then ran out again to pick some flowers. Then, they are all standing around the tree at night, singing. I guess they are saying goodbye to their youth. That could have been accomplished in much less screen time. Fast forward twenty years. James Averill is on a train west to civilize Johnson County, which is in anarchy. He is the new sheriff. From then on, the film is a mess. Their are so many scenes that serve no purpose. It takes over another hour before the characters are established. We learn that James had taken a lover in Ella, a local prostitute. Later, we learn that she has also fallen in love with a local gunman, Nathan Champion(Christopher Walken, wearing eyeshadow that makes him look like a clown). Champion is involved in a plot to kill 125 immigrants suspected of stealing cattle. It all leads up to several battle scenes that, thanks to the aforementioned photography, are very good to watch. But, the movie is so poorly made that I don't know how it escalated to the point of war. It has all been people talking to each other in cabins. The immigrants in this movie have no purpose but to look cute, look ragged or poor, and to scream things in other languages when under stress.The film has a point, I suppose, of how crappy it is to grow old. Many people think they are smart when they enjoy films with sad endings because it makes them feel like they are better then the rest of us because they don't need to feel good after a movie to enjoy it. Do not be fooled by these people. This ending is cheap. It is pointless. Well, I suppose it's point is a nihilistic view on life and old age.

Often it is not important as one eventually understands the approximate point of a non-English dialogue exchange, but here there is QUITE a bit... and when also considering 3A, there is DEFINITELY a feeling of missing quite a lot of the story. 4) A poor restoration (perhaps it was a re-release of the original 219min print?). 5) Poor film quality or photography. 6) The film is very unclear as to what point it was attempting to make. It was understood (during the screening) it dealt with the plight of new immigrants, but it FELT more about being SOMEWTHING in regards to the protagonist - and/or perhaps his view of the world. 7) Leaves too many plot & character questions unanswered. 8) Badly directed (or should this be #1?).The only good thing was the artistic direction (sets, locations, etc); the acting wasn't bad either (when one could actually hear the dialogue).It makes one wonder how a film could be so bad, when it contains such good actors - who at the time, were either at the top of their game or were about to become famous through their future work). This obviously proves (once and for all) that having the best actors does not necessarily make a good film.One wonders if the original re-cut 149min version is any better, but reports (and other comments here) suggest otherwise.

I seem to remember being slightly baffled by it. A western is not supposed to spend half an hour dwelling on the antics of students at the ivried towers of Yale. Why did the students appear to be middle aged men? Later, over the years, I decided that this is a great movie. I have to confess, I now do not know why. Maybe because of the very fact that it does confound our expectations of a western. After all, in the old style western the good-guys are trapped in a waggon-circle attacked by bad-guys in the guise of Indians eventually to be saved by the U.S. cavalry. Whereas in this version, the bad guys are still those-guys-who-killed-the-Indians but find themselves trapped in a circle attacked by good-guys who happen to be Russians, Ukrainians, Poles and Germans! Then the bad guys are saved by the U.S. cavalry. Confused? Maybe, on the other hand, this is a cynically realistic version of events.The encirclements are only one manifestation of the circular motif that utterly dominates this film. From the waltzes at the start, through the roller-dances in the middle to the view out of a yachts portal at the end. I recall reading many years ago in Studio International about a film by an East European director, about a peasant rebellion that was told through a sequence of circular battles. Presumeably this compositional ploy is a deliberate reference to it.Having just re-watched it again, aged forty-four I find that I am rather disenchanted. Why has it taken twenty-two years for me to figure out that what the bearded horseman in an argument with Christopher Walken early on mumbles as he rides off is Ella ain't yours she ain't no ones. Why? Because the dialogue throughout is abysmally unclear. I now realise that my younger self found the film baffling because much of what is mumbled and muttered and slurred by the cast is often almost unintelligible. Moreover, I know why the students were middle-aged! It was simply the directors ineptitude in expecting John Hurt and Kris Kristofferson to be able to depict themselves as younger versions of their characters.I also find myself belatedly agreeing that most of the scenes are simply several times as long as they have any reason to be. Such as that Waltz at the beginning. What exactly happens in it? A man tells a girl she is attractive. How long does that take? About three minutes! Now I also find that the all-pervasive miasma in the indoor scenes, which I had earlier regarded as an atmospheric allusion to dust, reminds me of the romantic clich√©s of Nineteen-Seventies photo and cinematography. Loads of haze, back-lighting and soft-focus. In fact, this film now strikes me as being shot in the style of soft-porn of the time!The strong lasting aspect of the film is its characters. Particularly the threadbare Nate, struggling to better himself by wallpapering his log-cabin with news-bills and teaching himself to read. He goes along with enforcing the bad-guys' laws, with absolute ruthlessness, only so far. Then, when the Barons push him too far, he becomes a martyr to resistance!I would choose as a tag-line the Kristofferson characters comment regarding his decision to go West ...so my life turned out differently.

You expect me to review HEAVEN'S GATE a movie that destroyed the Hollywood studio system and bankrupted United Artists ! Okay then , but mind if I ask where do I begin ? I've seen this movie twice . The original cut in 1986 and the short version ( Amazing to think a movie that has a 149 minute run time qualifies as a short version ) last night and I must say that it's a much better movie than Michael Cimino's Oscar winning THE DEER HUNTER if only because it has a much clearer plot  An association of cattle barons hire a mercenary army to kick immigrants out of Wyoming . There that's the plot perfectly explained and I doubt if anyone can clearly explain the plot of THE DEER HUNTER in one sentence . By a bitter irony Cimino then decides to muddy the waters by throwing everything but the kitchen sink into the movie and the film starts with a character set up in Harvard where friends James Averill and Billy Irvine have the party of their life . These scenes are very cinematic and epic as boys and girls waltz on the lawn but as for introducing the characters they become totally redundant later in the film . It's interesting to note that in the shortened version much of this has been edited out and replaced with a voice over where Averill travels to Wyoming on a train . This could easily have been the opening scene without any detriment to the narrative HEAVEN'S GATE has four credited editors a ridiculous amount for a movie and while watching the short version you can't help noticing how badly edited it all is . For example we see Averill and Irvine talking in a billiard room . Averill walks away into another room and confronts the association heads and receives applause from Irvine who is now sitting in a chair in the same room which gives the impression that he can teleport ! Even if you have no knowledge about film editing you can't fail to notice that many , many scenes start or finish in a completely unnatural manner but one can't help thinking it's not the fault of the editors since so many scenes should have been discarded from the script at first draft stage which would have led to a better and much more compact screenplay without it losing any epic quality . Having said that it wouldn't have stopped the sound editing being so awful and many sequences are ruined because the background noise drowns out the duologue Where the film works best is when it concentrates on the hatred the association has for the immigrants and when it does it is a great film at portraying man's callous inhumanity to man . It also contains some very shocking violence and epic battle scenes and it's a pity that HEAVEN'S GATE is known only for the behind the scenes fiasco than what takes place on screen . So if you watch this movie please forgot that it caused studio bosses to be the driving force on a movie instead of the director or that its production costs ballooned from two million dollars to forty million .

HEAVEN'S GATE is stunning in it's absolute badness. The character development is stymied by the overwrought art direction and onslaught of dust that envelops every scene. Kris Kristoferson --- not the most compelling screen presence to begin with --- is saddled with the lead role as the sheriff out to stop land baron Sam Waterston from killing a group of immigrants. On the way he gets tangled up with hired killer Christopher Walken and their mutual girlfriend Isabelle Huppert. That plot line sounds boring because it is. Cimino further compounds his massive blunder by populating the movie with a slew of terrific actors who barely register Jeff Bridges, Richard Masur, Joseph Cotten, and John Hurt, who literally staggers in and out of a few scenes to make some drunken moral statement.

What I can say is that I can't imagine how on earth United Artists could ever have imagined they had a viable commercial project on their hands in this unlovely, feel-bad, incomprehensible Western -- what mass-market audience did they ever imagine would flock to see a five-hour epic more akin to Andrei Rublev than to Stagecoach? Andrei Rublev, for Western audiences, at least had the benefit of subtitles. For many sequences Heaven's Gate is badly in need of them -- and I understand Russian and German, so I had a flying advantage over the intended audience! But it is the English dialogue that is in many places so 'naturalistic' as to be entirely incomprehensible. Add that to a script that simply doesn't explain important facts for much of the film, and a vast cast of barely-differentiated stereotypes, and you end up with viewers struggling simply to understand what was going on; I had to log on to the IMDb and read through a number of threads on the film's discussion board before I even grasped who the characters in the first and last scenes were meant to *be*, let alone what was the point of the scenes in question. (The latter question, I confess, still escapes me.) It wasn't until Averill got sacked that I even realised what his job was!My best guess as to what this film was actually trying to achieve is that it was a last-ditch attempt to fight back against television by doing all the things contemporary American TV couldn't provide widescreen presentation (which is well used here, without the all too common problems when composing close-up shots for a letter-box-shaped screen), gratuitous nudity and swearing (it gets thrown in every so often as if the director is trying to prove he can), and graphic shots of mangled corpses, intestines, splattered brains etc. And, of course, long stretches of running time with which to conjure magic in the absence of commercial breaks.But there is no way that it can justify its uncut length. It's plain from the first moment just where all those hours went -- not into complex plot or characterisation, but the very simple device of holding each and every shot that little bit longer than necessary. Every establishing shot of background activity could have been trimmed by at least half; all the endless pauses during the dialogue could have gone, to the improvement both of the general pacing and of the running-time. But even cutting the film back to the bone -- the reputed 90-minute version might have been interesting -- cannot cover for its other problems the mumbled and obscured dialogue, the deliberate and bewildering choice to film long stretches through dust or smoke, and above all the lack of basic exposition that left me struggling through the entire movie with questions such as 'who was that? why did that just happen? what did that mean?' The film is ugly -- deliberately so, I'm pretty sure -- and downbeat, again deliberately so. The only thing I can say in its favour is that despite the extreme running length, which kept me in the cinema from half-past six to eleven o'clock at night, and cost me eight pounds sterling into the bargain for this privilege, it kept me concentrating so hard on trying to understand what was going on that I was never even close to falling asleep; although all that effort did catch up with me during the intermission in the shape of a massive bout of yawning! It's not, I think, the worst film I've ever seen. It does have moments of interest and occasional beauty; it suffers principally by its gross and over-indulgent scale. But a film this size would have to be really, really good to justify the effort, and Heaven's Gate isn't even good enough to count as mediocre. By the end I was dying for a wise-cracking little comedy, a nice taut thriller or a lively silent melodrama -- anything to take the turgid taste of this bloated, putrid 1970s-era whale out of my mouth.Even a bad film would do. I'd rather watch Satan met a Lady -- infinitely rather -- than bother with Heaven's Gate again. I'd sooner see Lawnmower Man; at least it would be over more quickly. I'd prefer (heaven help me) to sit through What! No Beer?...One doesn't have to be prejudiced against a film to dislike it. The programme advertising the showing was full of praise for its brave, clear-sighted view of class struggle, its epic sweep unjustly cut from its original grandeur by the distributors. I saw it for the first time under the most favourable of conditions, on a giant screen with a sympathetic audience, many of whom had seen it before or were curious as to the uncut version (and who could be found during the intermission explaining the plot so far to their bemused companions); and after having seen the original product in all its unmolested glory, I'd say that the critics got it right first time round.

I have degrees in political science and history so this is an interesting genre for me. But unlike the brilliant Unforgiven, this film is horrifying to look at.

Worst of all, the movie needs to just stop after the battle scene...please just stop. This was bad enough to watch these citizens riding around and around and around and no really shooting, much less hitting anything. Did anyone think of having a battle plan perhaps? And why is the prostitute leading them? It is embarrassing and degrading to the heroic immigrants to be wasted in this way. And then it just won't end. You have to have a scene in which the last two decent characters are killed off and it is such a strange scene. While the rest of the movie has endless (and by this I mean ENDLESS) footage in each scene, ending in nothing, this last shooting scene is like a drive by -- literally. There is a drive by shooting at the end with horses. And then, it still can't end. You have to have the bizarre ship scene. I don't know what anyone was thinking about in this movie outside of how beautiful it looks. The best scenes are of dancing, and skating and more dancing, and...did I mention dancing?

It's quite an interesting film and even a very well made one. It bears many similarities to Cimino's earlier success, The Deer Hunter a focus on male solidarity and conflict, man returning to a more primitive state, a narrative structure that has the protagonist moving from civilization to a barbaric world and then back to a civilization that will be changed forever by preceding events. Like The Deer Hunter, this films deals in images more than words. Unlike The Deer Hunter, however, and this film's biggest failing, is the lack of a cast of the same strength that graced Cimino's earlier film. The Deer Hunter had Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken. Heaven's Gate gets Christopher Walken, but in a role for which he is ill suited, and instead of De Niro and Streep we get Kris Kristofferson and Isabelle Huppert. I don't know what possessed Cimino to think Kristofferson could carry a film of this magnitude, but it's a dire miscalculation on his part. Kristofferson isn't necessarily a horrible actor, but he's certainly not strong enough to retain an audience's interest over the course of a 219 minute film. Isabelle Huppert is bland as well. The result is long scenes with little or no dialogue, in which feelings are supposedly being expressed in the faces of the actors; but since the actors aren't very strong, nothing is getting expressed. That's what makes Heaven's Gate much longer than it needs to be. There's really only a wisp of a story, so if we're not fully engaged in the characters, what exactly are we supposed to be engaged in? However, the weak cast and writing aside, Heaven's Gate is still a remarkable achievement in its own way, and a much better film than a new generation of movie lovers has been led to believe. Cimino may stumble with actors, but he's got a iron-clad grasp of visuals, and puts some stunning and memorable images on the screen. The film feels much more like a 70's film than it does an 80's film. At various times, it reminded me of Little Big Man, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and The Wild Bunch. If that esteemed company doesn't serve as an endorsement of this film, I don't know what does.Grade B "},{"Title":"Infamous epic-scale western from Deer Hunter Director not as bad as you've heard","Date":"14 May 2005","Score":"11 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":" i have anticipated the viewing of this film for quite some time. its legend, being as infamous as it is, required me to see it, no matter how awful. i was also eager to see it based not only on my love for The Deer Hunter, which is tremendous, but also on my even greater love for the western genre in general. when i saw that IFC was playing the film this afternoon, i almost soiled myself with glee. however, i must admit that my eagerness was coupled with the bias of reviewers labeling the work as self-indulgent. i had no idea. the film is remarkably similar to the work of Terrence Malick on Days of Heaven. both films are image-heavy, but light on dialogue and plot. however, Days of Heaven succeeds in transporting the viewer to a world of transcendence and naturalistic beauty where HG succeeds only in forcing the viewer to act as surrogate editor since none of the five persons credited with the responsibility were able to do their job correctly. this is not to say that the film is bad. not in the least. it is, however, quite necessary for enjoyment that the viewer either be a student of film and its history, or at least have a lot time on your hands with no real concern about whether a story is being told, or simply hinted at. it would also help for the viewer to carry with her/him a sense of idealistic nostalgia bordering on naivet√©, since the film seems to be resplendent with said qualities. i happen to possess all of the above and was therefore able to thoroughly enjoy myself for the entire 3hrs and 45min. of the film. i find myself wanting to watch it again. i think some of the muddled characters bare repeat viewing for complete understanding, while others are archetypal and without dimension. Sam Waterston's character does everything short of twirling a handlebar mustache in order to leave us without doubt of his villainy. in contrast, Walken, Kristofferson, and Hurt all have multi-faceted characters not easily recognizable in the realm of Hollywood caricatures. David Mansfield's score is exquisitely complimentary of the majestic cinematography helm-ed by Vilmos Zsigmond. the battle scene, while confusing, is more true-to-life than most of the overly choreographed epics of that period or any other. i submit that this film is essential viewing for aspiring film makers. its viewing, if not ownership, is also necessary for the exhaustive collection of all true cinemaphiles. did i mention it's a little long?

Wow, I thought, if someone can commit that kind of sacrilege, then I will bring up Erich Von Stroheim.When Von Stroheim made Greed in 1923, the cut originally presented to MGM producers was over 10 hours long. Von Stroheim was a fanatical perfectionist with a singular vision. He alienated studios, performers, and crew members with his demands. He had no regard for studio budgets and time constraints. Greed almost killed MGM and was eventually chopped to 2 1/2 hours. The experience basically destroyed Von Stroheim's career as an American studio director, though he did make The Merry Widow a year later, as well as several other films.But, Von Stroheim was a genius. Even in its mutilated version, Greed is a masterpiece. The Wedding March is as good if not better.Mr. Cimino, you're no Erich Von Stroheim.

It has gone down in history as the film which bankrupted a studio and wrecked the career of its director, who only three years earlier had made the Oscar-winning The Deer Hunter. It contributed to the decline of the Western as a genre (although it was far from being the only cause). And played a large part in bringing to an end the reign of the Hollywood auteur, a reign which had begun in the late sixties and continued throughout the seventies (although again there were other causes). Recently Joe Queenan, the film critic of The Guardian, named it as the worst film ever made.Was he serious? Could Cimino really have gone from Oscar-winning whizz-kid to Ed Wood in just three short years? The answer is no. Certainly, the decision to make Heaven's Gate must rank among the worst business decisions ever made, but critics should beware of judging a film solely on its profit-and-loss account.The film is set in Wyoming in the 1890s, although actually shot in the neighbouring state of Montana. It is based, although it takes many liberties with the facts, upon the Johnson County War, a historical conflict over grazing rights between large ranchers and small farmers, many of them European immigrants. The film's main characters are named Frank Canton, Nathan Champion, James Averill and Ella Watson; real individuals with these names played a part in the conflict, although in each case this was not the same part as they play in the film.In the film Canton is the leader of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, which represents the interests of the big ranchers. The ranchers detest the small farmers, whom they accuse of stealing their cattle, and take the law into their own hands. They draw up a death list of 125 names and recruit an army of hired gunmen, who will receive a bounty for every person on the list killed. Averill is an idealistic Harvard-educated Sheriff who sides with the immigrants, Champion a hired enforcer for the ranchers who comes to doubt what he is doing. Ella is the madam of the local brothel and also the lover of both Averill and Champion. (In the film Ella is obviously French, but keeps the Anglo-Saxon surname of her real-life namesake, who was actually Canadian).When it comes to artistic merits of the film, I should point out that I have only seen the shorter 2¬Ω-hour version which was originally shown in cinemas and is the version normally seen on British television; I have not seen Cimino's director's cut, which runs to more than 3¬Ω hours. Certainly, Heaven's Gate has its faults. The dialogue is not always audible, and the plot sometimes difficult to follow. At times it can seem very slow paced, especially as the action is often slowed down by big set-pieces, such as the opening Harvard graduation scene (actually filmed in Oxford) or the roller-skating sequence, which are visually spectacular but do little to advance the story.These, however, are faults which the film shares with The Deer Hunter, and I find it difficult to understand why the later film should have been so reviled by the critics when the earlier one took Best Picture. The Deer Hunter was perhaps fortunate in that its Vietnam War theme caught the mood of the American public at the time, whereas Westerns had already started to decline in popularity in the late seventies. Possibly Heaven's Gate's left-wing political slant (its sympathies are very much with the with the little man against big business) alienated more conservative audiences. (1980 was, after all, the year which first saw Ronald Reagan elected to the Presidency).Heaven's Gate, however, also has its virtues (as, indeed, does The Deer Hunter), and to my mind these outweigh its faults. Cimino was a director for whom the pictorial qualities of a film were as important as its narrative ones, and as in the earlier film he shows here that he has a good eye for a striking visual image- the opening shots of the mist-shrouded university buildings, a train pulling into a frosty station, the barn dance, the soaring Rocky Mountains. The film borrows elements from a number of famous Westerns; the grand scale of its battle sequences recalls Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, its lush photography and warm tones are reminiscent of Malick's Days of Heaven and Altman's McCabe and Mrs Miller. (In that latter film too the main female character is a brothel madam).Perhaps the film's most interesting feature is the way in which Cimino gives a new slant to old Western themes. Averill is essentially a similar character to Shane or Eastwood's High Plains Drifter- the outsider who tries to help a community in trouble. The scene where the small farmers, who have decided to fight back against their oppressors, encircle the ranchers and their private army, is strongly reminiscent of all those Westerns where the settlers are encircled by hostile Indians and saved at the last minute by the arrival of the cavalry. The difference is that Averill is defending the community not against outlaws but against an oppressive Establishment, and the cavalry in this film ride to the rescue of the bad guys, not of the heroes. Heaven's Gate is a revisionist Western, not in the sense that it seeks to replace moral distinctions with moral ambiguity (as, for example, The Wild Bunch did), but in the sense that it seeks to give an ironic new meaning to some of the genre's conventions.Cimino was quite deliberately setting out to make a perfect masterpiece. He did not quite achieve that ambition, but it was an honourable one, and his failure was by a much lesser margin than some of his detractors would have us believe. Heaven's Gate, a Western on a grand and epic scale, can be regarded as a flawed masterpiece. 7/10 "},{"Title":"A flawed masterpiece","Date":"8 October 2000","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":"  Heaven¬¥s Gate is by far not the disaster its contemporary critics condemned it to be. And its by far not the pristine achievement its defenders want us to believe. As a movie, it has too many sequences that drag, to many lyrical moments that are great to watch but a major violation of the film¬¥s momentum and too many actors evidently not knowing where they are (leading players Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt pitifully among them). But it features Isabelle Hupperts still best performance in a non-french-language movie, one of Jeff Bridges finest performances and a storyline that is willfully political, anti-establishment and anti-Reagan. In fact Cimino seems at times more concerned with the contemporary overtones of his film than with the historic tragedy itself. Coming from a director who just two years before that had made the most conservative and pro-american film about the Vietnam experience (not about the war!), who ran away with the major Academy Awards for doing so, and who had - not to forget - co-written the Dirty-Harry-sequel Magnum Force together with John Milius of all people, Heaven¬¥s Gate must have come as a surprise with some impact. Being released in the launching stages of what was to become the Reagan-era, both Cimino and the film were dutifully punished for their conduct unbecoming. Heaven¬¥s Gate was resurrected as the flawed masterpiece it is at the Cannes film festival four years later. Michael Cimino still hasn¬¥t recovered from the massive blows his career had to take.

For those that praise this as a masterpiece or blame the studios for altering an artist's vision, are fundamentally wrong. This movie is one man's vision aided by an almost unfettered and unique opportunity to create an epic.The main problem with the movie is a lack of a cohesive narrative or in other words, the lack of a competent script. Other elements compound this fundamental flaw, the main one being poor casting. The excessive and totally unnecessary opening sequence of the class of seventy establishes Kristofferson as an educated and privileged American yet Kristofferson, as an actor is unable to convince in this respect. He comes across as a tough and dull frontiersman. This problem, that could have been corrected by omitting all the class of seventy sequences, is compounded by the casting of John Hurt whose character appears to be quintessentially British and the polar opposite to Kristofferson. Beginning the film with the return of Kristofferson to Johnson County would have helped in making this character more convincing.The production design is impressive and at times superb but it smacks of over-indulgence and wild excess. This story could easily have been told with one major build, that being the immigrant's camp.Ugly technical issues soon raise their head, as the dialogue in most of the opening scenes is inaudible. Another issue is the post-production sound design. The gritty realism so scrupulously recreated is mitigated by the use of the standard generic Hollywood gunfire sounds. Somehow it feels odd that noises emitting from the period pistols and rifles, that have a distinctly different sound when fired in reality, should sound so Hollywood.There is some wonderful cinematography in Heaven's Gate but this is offset by some truly awful cinematography, so the consistency and look of the movie is seriously compromised. The editing is also an issue. I am also unsure of the treatment of animals, especially horses, during the filming of this epic. Some of the horse falls look exceedingly dangerous and most certainly unnecessary. One live horse was literally blown up for the sake of celluloid and this begs the question; was it worth it? I assume that cinema is the art of recreating a reality with all the tricks and techniques at the filmmaker's disposal; so filming real brutality is unnecessary. Does an actor really need to be shot to convince of being shot? The blame for this mess of a movie lies squarely at the feet of Michael Camino but United Artists have some responsibility. It should have been clear that this story could easily have been told on a much smaller scale and although some images on screen are impressive it is not clear that the 40 million spent is all up there on the screen.Whether the praise lavished on this movie by reviewers on IMDb is based on a desire to be different from the crowd there is no getting away from the fact that Heaven's Gate fails in the basic requirements of cinematic craft.

It is the work of a true auteur - quite possibly as described in Final Cut - a megalomaniac.But undoubtedly a hugely talented one who knew exactly what he wanted,produced it and saw it mangled by a horrified studio that lost its nerve and in an act of sheer artistic vandalism comparable to cutting out two - thirds of van Gogh's Sunflowers because it was too big,ripped the movie to shreds before apologetically releasing a spavined version that made no sense whatsoever then raised its hands in horror as the movie,the director and ultimately the studio itself sank beneath the waves.Sic semper tyrannis indeed. Believe me,any movie The Guardian considers the worst of all - time has go to have an awful lot going for it. Heaven's Gate contains two scenes so exquisite that to attempt to describe them would be an act of intellectual rashness beyond me. I will simply say that the Grand Waltz at Harvard and the Roller Skate dance led by a violinist should be studied by anyone who seeks perfection in the blending of music,movement,lighting ,athleticism and grace. The movie is right now going through a process of rehabilitation,and I predict that any time soon Mr Cimino - based on a small output of highly individual works - will the recognition he richly deserves. Wild Card directors like Preminger,Peckinpah and Huston could turn their hands to Westerns that were beyond genre boundaries and are now revered for it. With Heaven's Gate,Mr Cimino has produced a part fable,part history lesson,part character study with a huge scope that perhaps adherents of Grand Theft Auto might have a little trouble getting down to,but he has,in doing so,put a whole lot of gone between himself and the rest of the Hollywood establishment.

The cinematography is almost always ugly, although it seems certain that this was deliberate, this being basically the anti-Western. OK, score one for realism, I suppose, inasmuch as the dust, dirt, and smoke were undoubtedly ubiquitous in those times. Most Westerns don't indulge in this, since there is usually such beautiful scenery to photograph that filmmakers don't wish to spoil these shots. There are unnecessary scenes, one often cannot discern the dialog, and sometimes one cannot even tell which character is on the screen. This is one of the prime examples of directorial excess. Oh, and the historical basis of the film is, as I understand it, seriously skewed. Cimino seemed to obsessively show things that we consider modern, that existed at that time, such as roller skating, billiards, and baseball. While I'm sure these things existed then, I'm not sure how many of them would have made it into rural Wyoming in 1890. The only real plus is the acting performances. Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, John Hurt, Jeff Bridges, and Sam Waterston all turned in excellent performances, at least as much as the material allowed. Isabelle Huppert more or less stole the show, what there was of it to steal. She was magnificent. I would advise most people to skip this one, except fans of Huppert.

How's that for a bad setting ? Especially  for a film with such an infamous reputation. How surprised I was to find myself loving this  film. I watched it many times, studying it, trying to find what was supposed to be so bad but  couldn't get it. I then found a Wide Screen VHS of the original long version. Maybe that would  explain the bad reputation. Well, it was even better. A good film made great. Actually, the  short version didn't seem to make sense after seeing the director's cut. But their are many  factors imaginable to justify the incomprehension of the film. First, the characters are not  defined by what they say but by what they do. Cimino volontarily leaves a lot of ambiguity in  them. Something audiences are not very used to. Second, there's the unusual techniques  used. For example, when a character walks along the train, talking, we loose some of the  dialogue as it would be in real life. Then there's the historical aspects of this western that  put a lot of viewers off. No more myths, everything is believable. From clothes, to music, to  accents, to the immigrants origins. Which brings me to the historical point of view. Heaven's  gate gives us an uncompromising look at the Far West and the building of the U.S.A. Like  most countries, it was often built by the rich eliminating the poor, by corruption in the  highest spheres of power, by the use of violence by the alleged noble men of the time, and  by making sure that nobody kept track of these invents, replacing them with mythology. And  many people didn't want to know about these aspects of american history. Plus their were of  course all the gossip around Cimino's dictatorship on set, his wild demands, going over  budget and length, but the real reason nobody wants to see this film for what it is, is that few  will accept the fact that violence is in the very fabric of America. And violence, betrayal,  disillusion (the main theme of the film !) are NOT pretty things to look at. Take another look  at Cimino's best movie. It's a demanding, intelligent, unique and uncompromising vision  of a country still looking for it's identity.

He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with the 'It's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided Heaven's Gate-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. Then a few days after seeing the 'Final Cut The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate' documentary I stumbled on a used $9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of just how big a mess Cimino made.While pretty much everything is wrong with this film, what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. Although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out rustlers. The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the Army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties. After all, these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians). And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell, the keeper of a modest road ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age). There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of Heaven's Gate it would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity.There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary.But don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production. The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'Fiddler On The Roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review.So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. Of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west.

I can understand the many reasons behind giving the film a second chance it was an unprecedented box office failure when it first came out in 1980; the critics at the time, lead by the great Vincent Canby of the New York Times, tore it to ribbons; the director, Michael Cimino, before proclaimed as one of the most promising of New Hollywood directors, has had next to nothing for a career in movie-making since; there's a lot of famous actors in the movie, two of whom are making their feature-length debut; and it's based on a true event.And on top of that, who wouldn't want to like it? Apart from the obvious (only the world's biggest cynic wouldn't want to enjoy a movie that runs 216 minutes), Heaven's Gate is a big, blustery epic. I happen to love big, blustery epics, especially ones set in the Old West. Now Michael Cimino, it goes without saying, did not want to make one of the biggest box office and critical flops of all time; he just wanted to tell a fictionalized account of the Johnson County War. But his film is insipidly tedious and incoherent, and every passing minute is more unendurably soulless than the one that comes before it.There is a vast, grand-scale vision, to the point where Cimino almost seems to have been shy about photographing a close-up of anyone or anything. And sometimes the camera does move in ways that are undeniably interesting&#x97;sweeping up and over a laundry line of bed sheets to reveal homesteaders as they finish butchering a cow. There's also a shot in the second half which recalls the haunting moment in Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai when the bandits came flooding over the hilltops. Kurosawa's picture&#x97;which did not have the timely advantage of a wide-angle lens, by the way&#x97;also ran just under four hours in length, but was constantly moving, even in its quieter moments. Each scene had a purpose and appropriately wrapped itself up as needed, not as in the case of Heaven's Gate, where ninety percent of the concluding shots consist of two people sitting in a room, looking either off-screen or at their toes. Also not in service is the photography, which is filled with so much visual dust that it looks as though the camera and the set had been separated by a dirty window.Maybe Cimino's idea for the dramatic scenes was to mimic another great Japanese director, Yasujiro Ozu. Here, the camera hardly ever moves; the static shots linger on too long and pile on top of one another with no particular style or rhythm. And in many of these interior-set, would-be dramatic scenes, in which characters just repeat points they made clear many times before, I think I came to better understand Vincent Canby's review, in which he compared the film's unrelenting boredom to a four-hour tour of a living room. Some of these scenes do feel that long, and we are frequently just staring at&#x97;guess what?&#x97;a room. The Academy Award-nominated art direction is authentically detailed and good-looking, but even the prettiest picture can lose its interest after a while.The cast of Heaven's Gate is rich with talent, but only one man has a good part to act, and that's the underrated Sam Waterston, virtually unrecognizable compared to his now-famous district attorney in Law & Order, this time playing a cruel land commissioner. Everybody else is stiff like a corpse and packed with mawkish emotion. The would-be love triangle between Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken&#x97;playing enforcers on opposite sides of the law&#x97;and an immigrant prostitute portrayed by Isabelle Huppert is utilized with no apparent motive except to tell us that a man and a woman, even if they come from different parts of the world, can fall in love. Any intelligent person from the 20th or 21st century already knows that. The point is obvious, so why not instill this dynamic with so passion? When Kristofferson and Huppert fondle and kiss in their first moment together, it feels forced; the actors seem outside their comfort zones. They don't really seem warm and affectionate, or even erotic, toward one another.John Hurt's also in the movie, playing a dimmer version of his usual wisecracking philosopher. But all of these people have no interest with one another, and yet so much of the story focuses on two or three folks just whispering to one another in an enclosed space. Now when the battles between the homesteaders and the mercenaries begin, Cimino promises some exciting action. The first bit&#x97;where an innocent man is brutally murdered&#x97;is excellently handled. The Foley, in particular, is marvelous. But each of the three subsequent violent sequences is less exhilarating the one before it, not helped in the least by the 10-20 minutes of drippy melodrama stuffed in between.Heaven's Gate is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is awfully tempting, for me, to call it just that. For 216 minutes, it left me writhing with boredom and frustration, only occasionally interested. I can forgive the movie's pointless prologue of a beginning, for it does feature what is probably the best scene set to the Blue Danube waltz since 2001 A Space Odyssey. But the ending, which is factually much shorter but seems so much longer, is an incoherent and confusing fiasco. As is much of what happens in the middle. So, no, the movie is not particularly worth rediscovering as far as I am concerned. Yes, Michael Cimino is a brilliant talent, and he deserved a better chance to redeem himself. But that's no excuse for mislabeling one of the clunkiest pictures ever made as a masterpiece. "},{"Title":"Dull, dull, dull.

Actually, there was only one circumstance I was dying of boredom and finally lost the will to watch one more minute of Michael Cimino's putative masterpiece Heaven's Gate. In fairness, I had bought the DVD of the director's cut and perhaps the theatrical release had had some of the more obvious longeurs excised. That might have made a difference, although in view of my other criticisms, I suspect it would not have made much of a difference. I feel something of a heel putting the boot in because Heaven's Gate more or less put paid to Cimino's career or, at least, the career he obviously imagined for himself as one of Hollywood's star directors. So perhaps he has had more than his fair share of brickbats. Who knows, although on the strength of Heaven's Gate he deserves every one. I remember being puzzled by The Deerhunter when it came out everyone said what a marvellous film it was, but I just couldn't see it, although in those days I had rather less confidence in my own judgment and assumed I was merely too stupid to see its finer points. These days, having rather more confidence (some might call it arrogance), I can state that in my opinion The Deerhunter was an overblown, portentous middlebrow offering masquerading as a masterpiece. In its day Cimino's technique of directing scene upon scene of 'atmosphere' to establish character was all the rage. It was regarded as 'authentic' to show men doing very little of consequence but booze together, play pool together, swear at each other, booze some more, swear some more and so forth for any number of increasingly tedious minutes. Heaven's Gate begins with something similar, a completely pointless introduction at Harvard or Yale or somewhere of the graduation of the year of 1870 which goes on and on and on and on and plays no structural role in the film whatsoever quite apart from being utterly dull. When the film does apparently gets into its stride, it turns out merely to be a run-of-the-mill 'little men with upright hero on their side' against the establishment (a common Hollywood theme to this day and a thoroughly dishonest one at that given the overriding power and influence the Hollywood establishment has in the world of Northern hemisphere filmmaking). If you have seen this film once, you have seen it 1,000 times, and, I should imagine, it was a lot better than here. All the clich√©s are there from grizzled Kris Kristofferson to Isabelle Huppert as the tart with a heart and two men in tow, to the nasty, nasty establishment leader &#x96; who is, moreover, a coward don't you know &#x96; and John Hurt's alcoholic idealist. (A measure, for example, of Cimino's cackhanded 'talent' and his sheer lack of greatness would be that we never get to understand why Hurt's character is an alcoholic or even why he and the grizzled hero are friends. Good, let alone great, directors bother with that kind of detail.) I finally threw in the towel during the scenes when Grizzled Hero turns up at Tart with Hearts bordello to give her a birthday present this rambling sequence of scenes was so utterly dull that I decided the film would and could never, but never recover. Perhaps it did, but dear reader, I really don't care. The only aspect to Heaven's Gate which might be regarded as impressive is the scale of the sets. But as they are what broke the back of the production in the first place, the less said about that the better.

There is no incentive to be creative, to put two characters or events together, to achieve symbolic depth and to get it all done in 80-100 minutes. Instead of that you get only the dreary concept picture about the good immigrants and the bad settlers, especially the vested business interests.In The Deer Hunter, Cemino spends an ungodly amount of time showing us just what great guys the 4 working men are. I've worked with my hands so I know exactly how great working men are they're about as good as anyone else.Kris Kristofferson is one of the best songwriters going. I love him. I have and listen to his music. I wish he'd write more songs and sing more. But one thing he can't do is act. He's about as good as Kevin Costner (except in Tin Cup). Picking Isabelle Huppert to be the whore with the heart of gold made as much sense as washing your wool sweater in sawdust. Christopher Walken's talents were, once again, wasted. He's believable with unbelievable words put into his mouth. Someone should cast him and Juliette Lewis as father and daughter. You wouldn't need a script they can both act in air.The good news is there were two magnificent scenes, both of them dance scenes. The movie is worth seeing once just for the scene with the fiddler and the immigrants dancing on roller skates. Unfortunately the rest is badly acted with cardboard characters whose only purpose is to illustrate the immorality of the privileged classes... zzzzzzAnother piece of good news is that it lasts only two and a half hours! That's a lot better than Costner's Dancing With Wolves which lasted three hours and one minute. Two and a half hours of propaganda is better than three hours of Hollywood's Enlightened self-worship. In fact, the movie was sort of watchable. It was watchable in the way the wine store clerk turns his face away when he tells you a wine is drinkable.But since I found the advertisements for AbDoer, the Magic Bullet and Herbal Magic a relief while watching Costner's epic, I figure Heven's Gate is three times better than Dancing, which is why I give it, roll the drums, three stars.

Philosophically, spiritually and morally, the Civil War changed everything. Religious men who wouldn't have slaughtered cattle slaughtered their own relatives in a carnage about money and property. The generation that fought and survived had come to see things very differently from the morals and ideals of the Founding Fathers. The next 30 years are testimony to a new morality.The industrialists, railroad real estate boys and Wall Street investment bankers had taken control of America in the 1840s and '50s, and they had seduced the moralists of the prim and proper Northeast to take the land in the Old South. When the war between the states was =officially= over, however, there was a lot more land to be taken. And a lot of surplus armament available to take it with.Heaven's Gate is largely the story of the continuing, undeclared, unofficial civil war between the survivors from both sides. There were a lot of innocent bystanders. Many were immigrants from Europe who'd helped the industrialists and Wall Street boys drive Old Dixie down and build the railroads that made the western invasion, err, expansion, possible. Others included the ancient Siberians who'd immigrated centuries earlier. The invaders called them Indians, and dealt with them as they dealt with everyone else who wasn't as well-armed as those who could afford the best weapons money could buy at the time.The film was a (far too thinly veiled) allegory for the linkage of racism, imperialism and expansionism to the internationalist imperatives of the '60s, '70s, and '80s to be tolerated by the powers that be of 1980. Beyond that, I'm going no further. I don't want no trouble, neither, and besides&#x85; Money talks, and the truth will always be underfunded.This is not an action-adventure film like The Wild Bunch, nor is it a morally righteous buddy caper like Silverado. This is the history of the Old West that Coppolla, Scorcese and others were probably too wise to make, though they'd have had the technical skill and maturity to have done a bang-up job. Cimino may have been acting like Al Pacino in Scarface most of the way, but like his Deer Hunter from just a year before, this is a pretty fair effort in many respects.Thirty years later we're a =somewhat= different and more sophisticated culture, and the interests that allied to murder this film before it was premiered are busy with other things. Those who appreciated Hanson's L.A. Confidential, Maxwell's Gettysburg, Beatty's Reds, Nicholson's The Two Jakes, LeRoy's I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, and Stone's Platoon and J.F.K. will probably find this film to their liking.

And the writer is able to tell you absolutely everything that man feels about entering that room in a mere five words.Now, say the writer takes five sentences to tell you the same thing because he wants to tell you what is in the room. Or say it takes him five paragraphs, because he not only tells you what furniture is in the room, but goes into minute detail about the color and the fabric of the upholstery and the grain of the wood and the design of the carpet and the images imprinted on the wallpaper. But what if he takes five pages as he writes about where the trees were grown that rendered the wood and the wallpaper; and where the sheep were raised for the wool for the carpet and the upholstery, and how much everything cost, and where it was bought and by whom and on what day and etc., etc.Now, those final five pages might be eloquently written, accurately detailed and maybe even fascinating in their own right, but somewhere between five poetic words and five rambling pages the narrative ceased to be about the man and instead becomes all about the room -- and not even about the room, but rather about the research the writer did in order to describe the room. Historical trivia takes the place of human emotion. That pretty much sums up the folly known as HEAVEN'S GATE, a slight, potentially meaningful tale lost amid a display of self-aggrandizing, ego boosting pseudo-scholarship.Michael Cimino's obsession with detail in making the film is legendary -- right down to insisting that era-appropriate underwear be worn by the extras. The writer/director bragged about how such details couldn't actually be seen but could be sensed -- by him if no one else. Of course, such details don't come cheap, whether in time or money or effort; and his manic need to make everything seem accurate and honest was responsible for making HEAVEN'S GATE one of the most expensive films ever made up to its time. The irony is that, though the trivial details might be right, everything else is wrong and that is why HEAVEN'S GATE became the biggest critical and financial flop up to its time. What was supposed to be a faithful recreation of a piece of Americana became instead a ponderous tour of a cluttered, dusty warehouse of arcane bric-a-brac.Of course, a desire for authenticity is all well and good, and is generally to be applauded; but in this film's case it just seems like hollow hypocrisy in light of just how dishonest the rest of HEAVEN'S GATE is. For one thing, the film supposedly documents the Johnson County War, a nasty little range war in Wyoming in 1892. A few people died unjustly and the federal government had to step in to calm things down. It could be the basis for a decent little movie -- or at least a 30-minute episode of Death Valley Days. In Cimino's hands, however, the war ended up being a tale of the mass slaughter of hordes of nameless, faceless immigrants, building to a major battle rivaling anything in the Civil War. Little of his bombastic version has anything to do with historical fact.Okay, Hollywood long ago gave up any attempt, let alone claim to historical accuracy (see John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE for insight), but usually it came with the suggestion that trading fact for fiction would reveal a greater truth. HEAVEN'S GATE fails here too. Though built around a nominal love story -- good guy and bad guy love the same woman -- HEAVEN'S GATE is all too obviously a heavy-handed anti-American, or at least anti-capitalism, allegory. The rich cattle barons (American capitalists) are evil; the poor immigrants (the Third World) are pathetic little victims. It is the same pompous propaganda Hollywood often embraces, though Cimino seems to think it is an original insight. But, as is the case with so much Hollywood liberalism, it isn't even Rich versus Poor or Oppressor versus Oppressed; rather it is Rich Conservative versus Rich Liberal. Though he crowds his frames with teeming masses longing to be free, as Cimino depicts them they blend into a pitiable mass, indistinguishable as individuals. Few of the immigrants are even given names, let alone identities.Cimino no doubt thought he was speaking out against injustice, but his view of the poor is soured by condescension, they aren't important except as a concept, a symbol of a liberal indignation. Rather than focusing on one or more of the poor fighting for dignity, his chosen hero is Kris Kristofferson's James Averill, a rich, educated, liberal do-gooder from the East who turns against his wealthy brethren in the name of the immigrants. HEAVEN'S GATE doesn't recognize the humanity of the poor, but rather salutes the arrogance of those who pity them.Cimino rode into HEAVEN'S GATE on a tidal wave of acclaim created by the success of his masterpiece, THE DEER HUNTER. Faced with the need to prove that DEER HUNTER wasn't a fluke, and that he really was a genius, Cimino no doubt immersed himself in the endless preparation and the tedious search for detailed perfection just as a way of avoiding actually completing the movie. Like the filmmaker, the film never really seems motivated to even get started, and hustle and bustle are substituted for actual drama. Thus, the film plods along, expecting the viewer to be inspired by the majesty of the Wyoming locations, to absorb the wisdom in the banal, long-winded dialogue and to be in awe of the authenticity of all the production design. But, it is like a bad joke with no punch line, there ultimately is no point. And Cimino ends up saying nothing other than See how hard I tried.

I was surprised to discover the film kept my full attention the entire time. That said, the original director's cut of Heaven's Gate remains as the 149-minute version did a great lumbering monstrosity of unrestrained excess filmed through a murky haze with a largely inaudible soundtrack. A great fan of the genre I was anxious to see this version. Would my mind be completely changed with the reinsertion of seventy previously edited minutes? I actually think this version might be better, but that's not saying much. It's a shame that Cimino didn't have an Irving Thalberg to reign him in, holding him to creation of the modest western originally planned. The entire catastrophe was set in motion when the director was given carte blanche due to the overwhelming success of The Deerhunter, a film which in fact had little or nothing to do with Cimino's abilities but rather select acting performances and, as in Heaven's Gate, the breathtaking cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond aided by an audience ripe with anti-Viet Nam War sentiment. The right place at the right time, this film was an opportunity of circumstance. Worthy of note is Cimino's ability to master the scope of enormous crowds and create spectacle in this film as he had done previously. There are many flashes of brilliance, the dizzying waltz at the beginning of the picture, the panorama of the roller-skating fiddler in the immigrant's meeting hall, the introduction of Christopher Walkin's character, Nathan Champion, through the hole in a sheet made by his shotgun blast as he kills a cattle thief and an excess of wonderful tracking, crane and aerial shots. The musical score is richly detailed with period pieces and original composition. Casting gave this film profuse talent, much of which was wasted. At the point in which Isabelle Huppert's character, Ella Watson, is introduced the momentum of the range war story escapes like the air from a giant burst balloon and the audience is left to flounder in the excess of a lovers frolic followed by unending and countless details each in themselves interesting but pointless and destructive to the overall story. There are scenes of great brutality performed without consideration for the reckless use of actors or animals that in fact was a result. I was also aware of several breaks in continuity with the addition of the previously edited footage. There are also long stretches of dialog in several different languages without the benefit of subtitles. This film is a great curiosity, like looking at a train wreck. But the sum of the parts fails to sustain the whole and the bloated excess of the film cancels out any positive qualities. Much has been said with regard to the moral ambiguity of the story. I would be more than willing to overlook that aspect had Heaven's Gate in reality been the tight little scenic piece it was originally planned as. It's also a shame the making of documentary screened Friday night was not grouped with the actual film itself. I did enjoy it. It wasn't the dose of medicine I thought I was in for, but definitely not for everyone or most anyone.

The first part also shows from where his idealism springs, as we here about the responsibilities of the educated and well-to-do from the 'Reverend Doctor' played by Joseph Cotton. We also see that he can be effectively competitive when he desires in the post graduation melee for the bouquet in a tree. From there, the movie becomes a sly play on the traditional western theme of the reluctant hero. What if the hero doesn't become active soon enough? What if he doesn't 'arrive in the nick of time'? How does he live in the aftermath of his own failure to act decisively? The photography is beautiful, like a series of paintings, but muted in color, perhaps to set the bleak mood of the ultimate ending. The sound is the worst I've heard in a big, expensive movie of this type. Its big and even overblown at times, but it has moments that stick with you for quite awhile after you've seen it. And you find yourself wondering if your getting what the director intended, or if HE really had a good grasp of what he intended.

The audience is left floundering among admittedly beautiful set-pieces which make little sense, and overlong scenes which add nothing to a story we can't understand.  It's a shame, because there is the essence of a great story here starving immigrant landholders legally exterminated by ruthless cattle barons, and the idealistic minority who try to prevent their slaughter.

Thirty minutes later, we were still jamming on that same song and we suddenly realized we were trapped in it!  Oh sure, some of the stuff we'd come up with was pretty good, but we couldn't find a way to close it off.  Finally, in sheer desperation, someone shouted out, When did this turn into 'Knocking On Heaven's GATE?' and the spell -- thankfully -- was broken.  We stopped playing, laughed ruefully, and went on to something else.This is the essence of director/writer Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, a seductive melange of incredibly well-crafted images and sequences that never add up, once you suddenly realize (somewhere deep within the first hour of this sleep-a-thon) that you don't give a flying hoot about a single one of the movie's characters.  (With the possible exception, that is, of Christopher Walken's superbly-rendered Nathan Champion -- and he's one of the bad guys!)Heaven's Gate is flabby, and it is shameless self-indulgence on Cimino's part.  (It conjures memories of Marlon Brando's One-Eyed Jacks, in which Brando at one point held up production for three days while waiting for 'the perfect sunset' in a single shot.)  In addition to being an exercise in poor story-telling, it's also an example of how historic events can be deliberately twisted and falsified so as to conform to a contemporary agenda The actual Johnson County War (which, by the way, took place in Wyoming, NOT Montana) was a struggle between large, already well-established, cattle operations versus the smaller Johnny-Come-Latelies; the local cattle barons (whether rightly or wrongly) accused the newcomers of rustling their stock.  In such a context, the question of an individual's ethnicity rarely, if ever, came into play.  The real-life James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) and Ella Kate Watson (Isabelle Huppert), by the way, were allegedly partners in a joint cattle-rustling/brothel operation; in actuality, they met their ends at the hands (and ropes) of a whiskey-laden lynchmob.  Strangely enough, however, the actual Nathan Champion's demise -- including the letter he writes in this film -- is historically accurate . . .  but then, that meets Cimino's needs here.Make no mistake This film is nothing less than superbly mounted.  The Harvard commencement, for example, while totally unnecessary to the film, is likely an absolutely accurate recreation of the era's graduation ceremonies (and a beautifully crafted sequence).  And I defy anyone to find better individual cinematography than in the roller-skating sequence (which ends with a singularly beautiful waltz, haunting in its wistfulness).Sadly, however, everything's wasted in this film -- cinematography, costuming (excellent, by the way), musicianship and location work.  The storyline -- if ever it was really there in the first place -- gets lost; beautiful individual images lead nowhere.  By the time (three generations after one began watching this movie) Kristofferson finds himself, inexplicably, on a yacht off Long Island, there's a definite feeling (for me at least) that the five million dollars it took to film this final sequence could have been augmented by another million or so . . .  simply to blow that boat out of the water!Never mind, though Heaven's Gate has already long-since sunk.

The film is very slow, certainly in the first half, but the central plot is interesting.  The Johnson County disturbances exemplify a critical moment in American history, even if the sub-plot of the alienated Harvard man, at the opening and closing of the film, is irredeemably trite.  That the working out of the plot is incoherent and chaotic is not a problem - these characteristics are implicit in the term disturbances and are an effective metaphor for the central concern of the film.  The settlers are disorderly in the conduct their lives and community affairs, they are thieves, not especially lovely people, and the moral balance is tipped in their favour only by the arrogance of power of the Stockmen's leader.Kris Kristofferson's plays his leading role to the limit of his talent as an actor, but sadly that talent is very small.  However, since the part requires him to say little, this is not a fatal flaw.  John Hurt plays a decadent drunk as well as an irrelevant and ridiculous part will permit.

At the one hour mark it became a distraction. At the two hour mark, it became downright irritating. I can only imagine what audiences of the 3 and 5 hour versions must have felt. There was something truly great cooking here, from a cinematographic point of view, but it was marred by over softening the image. Such a shame. I realize that the old west was dusty, but geez, did everyone also suffer from glaucoma?THE EDITING When you step back and think about the movie's story, central theme and performances (although sometimes uneven, mostly good), there was a really compelling movie here. However, the editing, or lack thereof, sabotaged any narrative momentum. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the long shot, and realize that every film has its own pace. As a matter of fact, I'm a fan of Cimino's previous effort, the Deer Hunter (which ran at a leisurely pace). The difference is that the Deer Hunter always kept the story front and center. But in Heaven's Gate, Cimino continuously extends scenes, almost as if he is forcing us to acknowledge how beautiful the shot is, and how brilliant he is. This vainglorious approach grinds the story to a halt in some points, and the film looses momentum. We lose interest because the film continuously seems to meander. There are too many instances of shots that should have been edited, because they contributed little or nothing to the story, but were probably kept because they looked good to Cimino. This movie should probably be analyzed in film schools as a cautionary tale, Or at the very least, used as an editing exercise. I believe there might be a good 90 minute film buried under its current 150 minutes. As an editing exercise, have the students reedit this movie just to see what we end up with. It might not turn into 'Citizen Kane', but I bet it would be an improvement.THE SOUND The sound mixing was another factor. The ambient noise in some of the scenes is so overwhelming that it drowns out the dialog. What was Cimino thinking? Dialog helps convey the story and develop the character. I get the feeling he was so focused in creating realism of the environment, he allowed the dialog (story and character development) to suffer. Trust me, I'm not a part of the 'haters' bandwagon. After reading some of the positive reviews to this movie, I made an effort to like this movie. I not only kept an open mind, I had a forgiving mind. I also made sure I packed a lot of patience for this journey. Alas, it was not enough. For me, the story and storytelling always have to come first. Everything else, including self-indulgent artistry, must take a back seat. Cimino forgot this, and that's why this film failed for me. By the way, I highly recommend the documentary Final Cut. It's an engrossing little movie about how this entire debacle unfolded.

This was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870. The point of that scene, I suppose, was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it just keeps going and going, and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness, made even worse by the fact that I found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent. In the end, I couldn't even watch this in one sitting. I got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned out.My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame, because there are positives here. The performances are generally of a high calibre, especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local cattle company's efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. There's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. Having said that, the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around. Seriously - 2/10.

Absolutely, especially if you are an aspiring filmmaker and want to see how not to make a movie. You can see what it is like to have a scene done over and over and how it can threaten a film. My favorite was the ending, you should see how well an 18th century prostitute can ride, shoot, and suck at realism.

Most of all it has a director with the patience to let scenes play themselves out and actually sink in, under the audience's skin. I can't think of another movie in the past 20 years that has so patiently and subtly revealed its characters lives.In other words, today, it doesn't stand a chance.I'm just as guilty as the next viewer of loving the quick moving jump cuts and I'll slap my $10 down on a 90-minute blockbuster as quickly as the next guy. But I really think this is what theaters were built for gorgeous cinematography splashed across the big screen; a luscious score booming through the theater and performances that never ceased to satisfy. And Christopher Walken in a multilayered role that could be described in some ways as a good guy? Come on! This is why we don't simply wait for Netflix to deliver the next pile of DVDs to our mail box.Heaven's Gate was quite simply destroyed by a horrible cut that cast the movie in the worst possible light, delivering an incomprehensible mess to American theaters and to a movie-going audience that was already primed to dislike it by the endless stories about its (gasp!) $40 million budget. In the context of a gas shortage and recession and hostage crisis its excesses were repellant and the critics savaged it. Practically cut in half, it made no sense, and how could it have? It seemed poorly edited-- of course.One scene in the movie shows a group of well-heeled men preparing to vote on taking an action of monstrous evil against a town. One man stands and appeals to reason and morality but its clear that the mob mentality is about to take over. One by one in line, any man who might have been thinking wiser of it falls blindly in line with the masses.Such was the case of critics of this film. Even to this day it's far from hip to praise Heaven's Gate. What a sad state of affairs. See it as it was intended by Cimino on the big screen (it's playing film festivals) and then come back with a review. Anything less is a different movie.Judging from the audience reaction at today's screening and the sidewalk discussions outside the theater (and during intermission), Seattle would have given this the Academy Award. One must wonder if Cimino has to pass away before people see this gorgeous epic for what it really is possibly one of the greatest achievements in American cinema. Breathtaking.

"},{"Title":"Seriously underrated...","Date":"4 June 2006","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":" By the time it opened, Heaven's Gate had become, to its detriment, more a cultural phenomenon than a motion picture. At a time when concern about excessive budgets and directorial arrogance were growing, it was a convenient target, as it was a far-over-budget work by the latest auteur to hit Hollywood, who had not yet established the track record that would have given him the benefit of the doubt among critics and the industry alike. As someone pointed out at the time, no one was going to jump on Warren Beatty's even-more costly and dark Reds, because Beatty was one of us, while Michael Cimino had not achieved that status.But Heaven's Gate was also affected by a cultural change taking place at that time, the political move rightwards and toward a more unquestioning patriotism and enshrinement of the myth of the West (and the Western). A few years earlier, Cimino's demythologizing of the frontier might have seemed timely, fresh, and a necessary corrective. But by 1980, in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, it was thought of as nearly un-American.Which is a shame, because the film, seen from the vantage point of several decades away, is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at that particular time and place as a world where life was, in Hobbes's words, nasty, brutish, and short. Kristofferson plays James Averill, an upper-class Easterner who, in search of adventure, becomes a sheriff in Wyoming, where he finds himself having to lead a resistance by the settlers and squatters against an attack by a mercenary death-squad hired by wealthy landowners, including Averill's lifelong best friend. In a more innocent time, Averill and his rag-tag army of poor farmers would emerge triumphant; but this is anything but a traditional Western, and when the U.S. Cavalry joins the fight here, it isn't on the side of the good guys.Much like The Deer Hunter, Cimino's previous film, Heaven's Gate spends a great deal of time building up the details of the lives of its principals, giving the film an at-times leisurely pace that nevertheless leads to a gripping conclusion. With excellent acting, a fine musical score, and the visual texture that makes one believe one is actually seeing the Old West through new eyes, Heaven's Gate is a film that rewards repeat viewings. I only wish that MGM would put out a new DVD, with an improved transfer and a commentary by Cimino. Nonetheless, the current version is satisfactory enough to let viewers see what critics in 1980, possibly blinded by the film's cultural subtexts, managed to miss...that Heaven's Gate is a great film.

It is important to note that this is not a Director's Cut as the original director threw in the towel after the problems with the original release.The people responsible for this restored version are John Kirk and the cinematographer of the original movie. Kris Kristofferson is also helping promote it and gave a taped introduction to the screening I was at thanking us for coming and saying this version had only ever been seen by the cinematographer and director before.It is really disappointing that this movie went so badly on it's original release as if it had been made in the 90's it would have done well alongside such films as Dances with Wolves. The money problems it had are dwarfed by films such as Titanic and Waterworld (which made it's money back!) There is no doubt Kris Kristofferson would have got an Oscar nomination for it too.For those of you who like action, Kris Kristofferson gets to punch up Christopher Walken in this film. Also there Kris walks around shirtless for those of you who think he is sexy.You can really see where the money went on this production as the buildings look like they are real and the sets are really complete. The costumes are also great and really fit the period also.Special mention must also go to the soundtrack which mixes traditional songs with a strong orchestral score. Look out for the Heaven's Gate band (including the roller-skating violinist) during the town sequences also.This film is only getting a limited release in cinemas so I would recommend picking it up on DVD.

The Characters do keep me interested, it takes time but it get's you there at the end and the music moves me, which is one thing that keeps me interested in films.   But I am sucker for long films.

There are long, pointless scenes, much like in the early parts of Cimino's Deer Hunter. Other similarities to this movie are the poor soundtrack - including the tiresome Strauss tune - and the unappealing visual quality. Visually, HG is awful it has a yellowish-brown look that sometimes gets red and then it looks as if though the events are occurring on Mars and not Wyoming. The movie's major flaw is the inconsistency in seriousness; on one hand, Cimino tries to make a reality-oriented western, discarding the silly clich√©s of the genre (which is a good thing), yet he shows things in terms of black and white on one hand there are the evil rich, and on the other the noble poor - much like in a fairy tale. Well, a yellowish-brown fairy-tale. At moments, it seems as if though he was trying to say that the Old Wild West would have been better off with a Marxist government. He never becomes specific politically but there is no doubt where his left-wing heart lies. Then we have the battle scenes which are full of bad directing and absurd moments 1) all Bridges ever does is repeat about a hundred times to Hupert that she should run for cover, 2) in the first battle the immigrants get massacred, yet the main Evil One goes back for more help - even though the viewer barely gets to see any evil ones getting killed, 3) the John Hurt character reaches heights of absurdity when he stands around making wise-cracks (then predictably gets shot); the John Hurt character is supposed to be some kind of disillusioned intellectual who takes to the bottle and sort of narrates the goings-on - pretty pointless, 4) the army guy in charge of the evil hordes waves ever so slightly with his hand for the fire to stop and somehow all the men stop shooting; how the hell did they notice his hand?! And so on. Then there is that silly ending with Hupert getting shot, that seems to be right out of the pen of a horror-movie writer. Why does Hupert tell Kristoferson twice that Walken asked her to marry him? The last scene is pretty lame and pointless; Kristoferson is shown years later with another woman in what must be one of the most pointless scenes I've seen in a while there is barely any dialogue, the woman asks for a cigarette, and he gets sentimental over Hupert - and all of this takes an eternity! Cimino seems to think that the information in this movie is so difficult to digest that he must leave plenty of time to the viewer to think things through - while nothing happens on screen. Cimino seems to be your average anti-American director. Showing the corruption and faults of that American period is okay, but if you're going to do it, don't get carried away with left-wing anti-capitalist zeal or you'll end up with what Cimino ended up with this tiresome mess.

Well, this one is more, shall we say, grittily photographed and not as idyllic, not with the DVD-esque sheen.  Malick is not as prone as Cimino (see also -The Deer Hunter-, especially the first hour-or-so filled mostly with the party scene) to over-bloating the story at the expense of pacing.  -Days of Heaven- can be irksome in its own ways, but it gets its story told in a timely fashion; -Heaven's Gate- is obviously, clearly, drawn out too long, without the benefit of an adept editor's craft or a scriptwriter's focus.It's most unfortunate, too, since this could have been a classic, and you end up feeling sorry for it as it stands.  Personally, I really wanted to like this, and was into it for even as long as an hour, but started to get tedious, and then got more tedious, and more tedious still, and then some more, and then culminating in a shoot-em-up sequence that was as unfocused and overly drawn-out as the previous 2 hours.By coincidence, it happens that I saw -The Jack Bull- just days before viewing this -- and, as a portrayal of the ways of late-19th century Wyoming frontier, the lawlessness and so forth, it gets it done with much more economy.Still, a 6.1 IMDb rating underrates this film, and I was surprised to see it that low.  (Given the tendency of quality for films with a given rating, I was expecting to see a 6.8.)  It *does* manage to reflect the amount of work that went into it.  It's not a bad film, not a great one, just an interesting, otherwise well-done work dragged out way too thin and long to be great.

And then I saw The Deer Hunter, which I found to now be one of my favourite war films. So I decided that I'd start watching the rest of Michael Cimino's short filmography.When I clicked on Heaven's Gate, I discovered that it's a rather hated piece of cinema for some people and that it pretty much destroyed United Artists. So I was quite intrigued to view this film. Now I've seen it, I can say that it is a terrific motion picture.The story follows James Averill, the marshal of Johnson County, Wyoming who has a French girlfriend named Ella. He learns of a death list targeting many immigrant farmers that has been issued by wealthy cattle ranchers. He later finds out that Ella's name is on the list and tries encouraging her to leave while she can. There is also a gunslinger, Nate Champion, who is in love with Ella, and she seems to be in love with him.I was kind of sceptical upon the reveal of Nate's love for Ella, because it is similar to part of the storyline in The Deer Hunter. Feeling as though there would be a hint of unoriginality, but I was wrong in thinking this. It is a piece of conflict which works so well, for there is a battle of love and life in a time of pure panic and nearing mass death.The photography of this film is almost flawless. It is so well shot throughout it's 3 and a half hour runtime, but some of the shots could've been shortened despite how attractive they were. Kris Kristofferson's role as Jim is great, coming across as a man with heart but hiding it behind a tough face as the film goes on. Isabelle Huppert's role as Ella is also great, playing the woman who doesn't want her human rights to be spat on (even for a time of discrimination towards women). Even John Hurt's rather little role as William, who is drunk in all his appearances, is really good acting. I found Christopher Walken's role to be another one of his average characters, good overall but nothing outstanding.I thought the battle towards the end was completely gripping and brutal. It was excellently crafted and although I've never been in a battle, it felt realistic. I have to admit though, the death of Nate Champion shortly before the battle felt quite silly and over-dramatic. But from what I've seen so far, seems to be Cimino's trademark. Another trademark of Cimino's I've realised, is the unexpected. When Jim, Ella and John (Jeff Bridges) are ambushed after the battle, James being the only survivor, I was taken by surprise. It shows the reality that Cimino likes to convey, being the loss of loved ones. I wasn't too sure on the ending though, set near 2 decades later, where Jim is now with the girl from his college graduation.

Most have focused on the American Civil War or stories that take place during that time but not directly involved. As for western films that are based between 1870s and the early 1900s, doesn't feel all that popular of a time zone. This story however is a real life based event. Sadly, as much as I've heard and read about how terrible it was and how badly it performed at the box office, I still wanted to enjoy what was given to its viewers. IT IS a movie that is exceptionally and competently made. The actors are convincing, the music is appropriate, the realism is explicit and the story has an interesting premise. Yet, the writing and direction is what makes this film almost unbearable.The story is about lawman James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) who learns that a group government officials have decided that the immigrants of Averill's county are nothing but leeches that pillage the loyal citizens cattle for money. This is what they believe, when in fact, these judged immigrants are in fact just people trying to get by in life. To help these people, Averill makes it his mission to help these wrongfully accused individuals. This premise is great. Seeing civil unrest is a different concept that not many people see enough of now a days. At least in the movies. Along with Kristofferson, the cast includes Christopher Walken (as Nathan Champion), Brad Dourif, John Hurt, Richard Masur, Jeff Bridges and even Mickey Rourke. And they all put in very good performances. Here is where it fails though.The writing is all over the place. Even though the actors perform well, the characterizations of their roles are either misguided, unclear or confused. Here are some examples; Kristofferson's character goes through a series of flip-flops and its not just about the main plot. Bridges' character seems to have no motivation other than to faithfully follow Averill blindly. He just hops on the bandwagon. John Hurt's character opposes the government officials' plan, yet later on is spectating the whole set of events. Also he's drunk half the time saying, silly things about Paris. Then there's the main girl named Ella (Isabelle Huppert) who Averill and Champion both love. And I'm sure most viewers know how that turns out since it's a love triangle. It's because of this that the screenplay makes these characters not extremely likable. Again, they were well performed but the charm is barely there.On top of that, the direction is very, very slow. Long running time films are not a problem if they are tightly woven and the story has substance. Gettysburg (1993) by Ronald F. Maxwell is one of those films and mind you, that it's even longer than this movie. Sadly, the way the story of this conflict plays out, could've been condensed into a much shorter running time, if the story was going to move at such sluggish pace. The assumption behind all the time wasted, was that there are numerous scenes where either nothing is being said or done that has doesn't have any relevance, or the scene may just contain what looks like background shots of everyday life of that particular time. Of course, viewers want to get an idea of what life was like back in that time but it doesn't need to drag on and on and on.Adding to that never ending feeling are the actors who play the immigrants. The fact that they are playing immigrants isn't the problem because they too act very well. Viewers may have problems with the fact that subtitles aren't used. Just watching a bunch of people arguing and speaking gibberish to most is boring and uninteresting. If you don't know the language, would watching a movie spoken entirely without subtitles entertain? Probably not. And to sit through that for almost four hours is really pushing people's patience. Having immigrants speak their native language is realistic yes, but to watch it give no purpose to the plot is flat out silly. The only thing that helps it bring it to a bearable status is the production value.The set design, props and realist conflicts that take place are noteworthy. Complimenting that is Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography. Holy hannah does Zsigmond get some amazing shots. This guy gets everything from fields, mountains and forest backgrounds. Even the town and train station set pieces are amazing to look at for how enormous they are. Zsigmond was also the cinematographer for Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and later also worked on Maverick (1994). Then there's David Mansfield's music. This is Mansfield's first theatrical score and although there is no main theme or orchestra to match the film's large scope, he ironically still makes the music work by using a single guitar like instrument. The contrast of the singular music one string tunes vs its big scale match, even though they are polar opposites. It's not memorable but it did work.The grandiose production value and talented cast is its strongest asset. Sadly its not enough because everything gets squandered from slow pacing and an under whelming script that fails to develop its characters properly.

The $40 million boondoggle has drawn the ire of critics ever since it sent United Artists into the red, and most of the criticism appears warranted.Michael Cimino rose to fame with his Vietnam war film The Deer Hunter. Although I found that film grossly overrated, it still stands as a good film. You could see some of the excesses of Heaven's Gate festering in the Deer Hunter, though. A wedding scene early in that film drags on and on, for example. Nearly all of Heaven's Gate is like that scene. But not only is it too long and poorly-filmed, you also have to strain to hear most of the dialog. Heaven's Gate becomes an endurance test as the three and a half hour epic staggers on to one hopeless scene after another. Cimino hasn't done much since, and after viewing this film, it isn't hard to see why.Much of the story deals with a principled lawman played by Kris Kristofferson and his attempts to protect a slew of new immigrants from ruthless cattle barons in 1890 Johnson County, Wyoming. Some of the film is loosely based on actual historical events, but that's hardly a reason to sit through it. The plot is needlessly bogged down by a love triangle between Kristofferson, a local madame, and Christopher Walken who is mostly aligned with the cattlemen. Taking out the love story would have been the most logical way to improve the film, but there are plenty of other things that doom this one.First of all, the film is poorly photographed. Everything is too darkish-yellow and under-lit. Perhaps they were going for the look of an old-fashioned photograph. The last person I'd probably blame was the cinematographer. He's a legend in the business, and most of his other films look very good. Clouds of dust and smoke obscure many of the scenes. Even a wisp of smoke from a tiny chimney seems to get in the way of the action in some shots. A battle scene at the end that almost seemed compelling is lost in what appears to be a biblical sandstorm. Another problem this film has is with sound. A fair estimate would put 30% of the dialog as being nearly impossible to hear. Did they not think of using voice-overs in post production? What happened? Characters appear and disappear for long periods of time. John Hurt is always appreciated, but he's never on screen long enough for the audience to really grasp who his character even is, for example. Some scenes drag on too long, and others look like they wandered in from different movies. What on Earth was up with that huge rollerskating scene? I didn't even know they were invented back then. Maybe the scene is actually an outtake from Roller Boogie, Skatetown USA, or Xanadu. Did Cimino need to include rollerskating just because it was so popular in 1980?? About the only good things this film has going for it is decent music, and some good shoot-outs. That's about it. The film tries to champion the rights of immigrants, but ends up doing nothing more than condescending to them. Any real message in the film is lost in its technical incompetence, and poor pacing. A Western is not a good genre for a film that takes itself so seriously. What a waste of talent! 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.

I appreciate the slow-moving introspective films of Kubrick, Leone, and Terrence Malick. In Heaven's Gate the story (or arguably abundance of strands that never fully gel as a story) is not slow-moving; it doesn't move at all. There is a feeling of ineptness to this writing; plot points are set up with no pay-offs, conflicts are improperly introduced, and some characters just wander in and out of the movie at random, most notably John Hurt. Supposedly there was to be more to his character, but many of his scenes got canceled as he had to leave to make The Elephant Man. Well, I guess it's better to play a deformed man than be in a deformed film.The movie starts with a 20-minute prologue of a graduation ceremony that is often criticized for being irrelevant to the rest of the film. I actually found this sequence to be well-shot and successfully conveyed a feeling of epic grandeur. Had their been more focus on Joseph Cotton's speech, audiences would have been able to better connect with the scene and see how it connects thematically to the rest of the story. The problem is that Cimino focuses more on this grandeur and spectacle then he does on the content, and this flaw continues throughout the film. My criticism isn't that nothing has happened 20 minutes in; it's the fact that by the 90 minute mark you still don't know what the hell the movie's about.Stuff just happens with no feeling of flow or narrative. Jim and Ella swim together. People play an early baseball game. Someone gets killed. Jeff Bridges shows up to play a hollow shell of a character. 52 takes were spent on a scene where Jim cracks a whip in bed. Was it worth it? Well, let's just say that were it not for that anecdote, I would have no memory that that scene is in the movie. One of the most famous scenes is the skating rink sequence with the fiddler. I had seen this scene before on YouTube and found it to be very lovely as a stand-alone scene. Ironically, when I actually saw it in its proper context in the film, it no longer seemed magical. The scene is tragically undermined by the excess of nothing that precedes it.Here's an example of dysfunctional storytelling it is revealed (via a very dull boardroom scene) that the cattlemen association have a list of 125 settlers they plan to have killed. Okay, so this is supposed to be our story's conflict. It is then 40 minutes later before this is EVER brought up again, and when it is, there is no new development; it is simply mentioned in passing dialog. It's like the story was an afterthought that got buried. It also doesn't help that the settlers are stock characters who are never developed.The other plot line in the movie is a love triangle between the three leads. This has two problems 1) It never really meshes with the cattlemen vs. settler plot line and feels like a different movie, and 2) It's already in full swing when the story begins. I would have preferred to have been told a story about the development of this triangle rather than just observing it already happening.Another anecdote I've heard is that during the intermission at the premiere, Cimino noticed the audience was subdued and was told Because they hate the movie. I think I can understand that audience quite well. When I reached the intermission, I did not hate the movie, I just felt empty by the vapid nothingness being put on screen (it also doesn't help that the intermission happens at a completely arbitrary moment with no sense of rising action).The irony is that there's nothing really bad about the movie aside from its screenplay. The music is great, the sets are great, that actors do a good job with the scarce material they have, and the cinematography can at times be some of the best ever put on film. Yet somehow this makes the movie EVEN WORSE. The fact that it looks so pretty only adds to the feeling of disconnect; it makes the movie seem out of touch with reality. The final battle is fairly exciting, and I will admit that the movie has a shining moment of greatness when a character is surprisingly killed in a heartfelt scene. Had the movie ended right there, it would actually have been a strong ending. But no, we're treated to badly-conceived epilogue on a yacht. As with the prologue, I see what Cimino was trying to do, but it fails because of lack of character development. Again, Jim's personal story never meshed with the story of the rest of the film.Heaven's Gate is certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen (that honor will always go to Problem Child 2) but it is the messiest in terms of storytelling. I know there are many who defend it and call it a misunderstood masterpiece. I always respect everyone's opinion and have tried to read these arguments, but I feel like they are just playing a game of pretend. Each fan brings their own interpretation to the nothingness on screen. For me, Heaven's Gate did something far worse than bore me or fail to entertain; it left me feeling angry.

They can't seem to be quiet long enough to reason out how to solve their predicament. Without the help of the rich, smart white guy they would be killed by the rich, evil white guys.Spoilers....A fine example of this is during the final battle at the end of the movie. The Kristofferson character has supervised the building of several quite ingenious movable barricades. The idea is they can hide behind these, using them to roll up and attack the pinned-down hit-men who are out to murder them. The basic concept is 'stay behind these and you won't get shot', yet repeatedly during their approach Kristofferson has to pull immigrants back behind the protection of the barricade because in their hysteria they keep running out into the open to throw their dynamite at the bad guys -- and risk being shot. You can almost sense the Kristofferson character shaking his head in disbelief at their stupidity, wondering why he's risking his life to even bother to help. The viewer also can't help but feel the same way during this entire movie.For a movie such as this -- a 'little guy standing up to a bully' theme -- the basic essential is you're supposed to CARE about the little guy. In Heaven's Gate, you don't, not even close. In fact, the poor peasant immigrants here are so shallow, so non-dimensional, so loud, so hysterical, so non-thinking that you actually almost find yourself rooting against them. They're just a screeching horde, individuals of which come and go throughout the film and you have no idea who they are, why they're there, and what their dreams are, and as a result you don't care about any of them. However, the movie as a whole is not horrible -- there are certain scenes that are actually very well done. But as a whole it's unreasonably long and worse, uninteresting. The codas at the beginning and ending of the film of the Harvard graduation and Kristofferson aboard his yacht as an old man are completely pointless -- take them out and nobody would miss them. Most scenes go on and on for entirely too long, for no apparent reason other than the director seems to love everything he does. Like most famous movie directors who achieve fame and praise early on, each of their successive movies seem to get longer and longer and longer, yet not necessarily better, because they fall in love with their own greatness -- and because the studios cater to them and let them. Such is the case here. I do however appreciate Cimino's attempts to accurately recreate the old west -- mud, filth, dust and smoke included. However the way it's done is went completely overboard. So much of the movie is shrouded in murk you literally can't see or hear anything. James Cameron's Titanic is the polar opposite of Heaven's Gate. Both movies are very long, tragic tales, and both went terribly over-budget -- each threatened to bankrupt the studio -- yet Cimino's film emerged as a pretentious failure while Cameron's film earned a billion at the box office and is a true masterpiece. Even hardened, cynical types get teary-eyed by the end of Titanic, even if they won't admit it, and are awed by the photogenic beauty of the film. The difference between to two films is Cameron populated his story with people you actually cared and rooted for -- you wanted the poor immigrants in steerage to overcome their plight, to survive along with (maybe instead of) most of the rich worthless snobs in First Class. Cameron's poor may have been caricatures too but they were not obnoxious -- he filled them with nobility and made sure they took it upon themselves to fight for their lives without the need for outside guidance. The main characters and immigrants in Heaven's Gate are simply annoying, the story incomprehensible, and the muted dusty cinematography is shameful.Kristofferson is rather bland as the Harvard educated sheriff. Hupert is hard to understand, but really does look like a prettier version Anna Pacquin as some here have mentioned. John Hurt's character is a mess -- however the scene atop his horse where he disappears in a cloud of smoke is amazing. Sam Waterston is deliciously evil as the leader of the 'posse'. Chris Walken is also very good as a bad guy -- you never know what he's going to do or what he's capable of. However, when he takes the time to write a good-bye note while trapped inside a burning cabin it's the highpoint of ridiculousness -- and that scene pretty much sums up the movie.

Being both a fan of Westerns and of the West in which I have the great privilege of living, I settled in for the nearly four hour Western. Having had time to reflect on the experience, a few observations seem in order. First, the acting is impressive. Christopherson, Walken and Huppert are very good while Waterston is terrifying as a man driven not so much by greed as by a principle of property rights; a riveting performance. The accuracy of attire and equipment is laudable seldom do Westerns, even those set as late as this one, show the use of shoulder holsters that was very common in the old West. The beautiful Blackfeet country of northern Montana makes a passable stand-in for Wyoming. Sadly these positives cannot make up for the two insuperable drawbacks the script and the direction. I do not require absolute historical accuracy as this is not a documentary but when the names of real men and women are used and not even their deaths are accurate there is something terribly wrong. Only Champion dies in anything like the way of death of any of the main characters. Averill and Ella were hanged early on and yet in Heaven's Gate Averill survives to weep on a ship in 1903 while Ella is shot. Why not name these folks Smith and Jones if they are to bear no relationship to their namesakes? There are so many of these departures from reality that for me at least the movie was ruined. It was filled with these but that never happened moments. Further, even granting the rewriting of lives, deaths and professions, why does no one, save the Eastern European immigrants, the station master, soiled doves and the bartenders ever do a lick of work? (I was minded of Ozzie and Harriet with Ozzie never going to work.) Averill and Ella in this version do not have their small spread as they did in life but Averill as a sheriff seems to do little to quell criminal action until the climactic battle. Dancing seemed to happen more frequently that tending cattle and there is nary a cowboy to be found. Who cares for the stockbreeders herds? Never has a movie plot turned on a treasure as invisible as the cattle in Heaven's Gate! The greatest negative however is found in the director for it is apparent that Michael Cimino loathes the Western and, even more sadly, the West. This comes though in the dust and smoke, the lowering skies, the camera angles, and the drab colouring of everything. Other anti-Westerns, especially Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch mourn the passing of the old West with a revisionist story but a heart that loves the West. One may hate the Western movies but love the West; Cimino obviously hates both. This cripples Heaven's Gate. Anyone who can manage to make Montana less than gorgeous must be working very hard. I know this country well and while some mountains were familiar, the use of camera angles etc nullifies the beauty. I guess if one works hard enough one could make even Sarah Michelle Gellar look homely, though I cannot think of why one would do this. Similarly, why would one work so hard to make the High Plains and Eastern Slopes of the Rockies less than they are? That Heaven's Gate was a flop is sad, especially for United Artists, but sadder still is that such a talented director could so dislike the West itself.

Kristofferson just doesn't have the necessary talent to pull off such an important role, and I could never shake off the idea that I was watching the guy who starred in Convoy and Semi-Tough. His career never really recovered after this. Rumour has it that John Wayne was originally slated for the part in the early 70s, and the mind boggles at that thought. Walken as the Cattlemen Association's enforcer who suffers a fit of conscience fares a lot better, and Isabelle Huppert gives a credible performance as the immigrant whore who attracts the attention of both Averill and Champion and the wrath of the cattlemen.Perhaps the clearest evidence that the three-hour-ish version I saw was trimmed from Cimino's original running time was the relative waste of John Hurt and James Bridges, both playing characters on the periphery of the action for whom you get the impression that bigger things were planned. As it is both characters are virtually superfluous to the plot.The film ambles along at its own pace, and is quite a pleasure to watch, even if it is really just a 90-minute story in a 180-minute film. Its signature tune is memorable although over-used during the skating rink sequence.As others have mentioned, the sound is atrocious during the first scenes in Wyoming.

Given the budget of his choice, he decided to follow up his masterpiece with a script that he had been hoping to produce since his humble beginnings as a Clint Eastwood prot√©g√©. Having already brought his inimitably masterful vision to the (then) fresh debate of the Vietnam War, the director chose to adapt yet another periodic American conflict the infamous battle of Johnson County. As I'm sure you're well aware, the result was perhaps the most monumental flop of cinema history, which immediately relieved the young auteur of his promising career as a master filmmaker and sunk an entire studio without a trace. This inevitably changed Hollywood forever. Gone were the days of the ambitious auteur and the daring studio executives with something to prove, and eventually the eighties opened up an extreme user friendly environment where budgets would be handed out with extreme caution and prejudice to those with artistic tendencies. Looking back over a quarter of a century later, it's surprising how well The Deer Hunter has retained its composure. It remains a touching portrayal of human companionship, emotion and loyalty that's packed with brash political overtones that raise questions even today. The merits of his magnum opus and my love of the Western genre led me to finally view Heaven's Gate and see for myself if it was in fact the turkey that its grim reputation has allowed it to be remembered as. The gratification of viewing a gun totting cowboy movie from the virtuoso imagination of The Deer Hunter's creator was indeed an allurement in itself. I strongly hoped that Cimino had suffered only because after the bloated excess of such over-budgeted over-abundances as Apocalypse Now, the media had decided to target him for career annihilation as they have with countless others in the past. On return to Casper Wyoming, Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) learns from his drunken friend Billy Irvine (John Hurt) that the association have written up a death list to rid the county of what they see as thieving and money-hungry immigrants. His hooker with a heart of gold sweetheart Ella (Isabelle Huppert) is on the list, which forces him to beg that she leaves the state to head West with him away from the animosity. However Ella is also involved in a relationship with a hired gun, Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), who has accepted the task of assassinating those that the association has targeted at the price of $50 dollars a head. Although the coupling is initially professional, emotions become confused when Nate proposes that Ella marries him. As the rivalry between the rich and poor worsens, the immigrant community realize that to survive they have to adopt the policies of their aggressors, which results in a bloody battle for survival and independence.Upon viewing Heaven's Gate, one of the immediate things that you notice is how damn beautiful the movie actually is. Vilmos Zsigmond's lush cinematography is a sight to behold and frame by frame the runtime looks like a collection of stunning and realistically gritty portraits strung together artistically for audience appreciation. Cimino manages to handle scenes with a huge abundance of activity like the master craftsman that he truly is. Although many sequences, like the sprawling dance at the beginning or the bizarre roller skating 'disco' are predominantly pointless, his dedication, flare for authenticity and overall guidance remain highly textured and visually astounding throughout. Averill's locomotive arrival is (arguably) unintentionally reminiscent of Jill's mesmerising landing from C'era una volta il West. The streets bustle with activity as passers by go about their everyday business, and the director does well to control an amazing number of accurately costumed extras, without taking the emphasis away from the plot's focal points. It's interesting to see a pre-CGI outing that has such strong and realistic art direction and set locations that weren't simply created over a blue or green screen. In fact, Heaven's Gate puts Lord of the Rings and Troy to shame with its stark realism and dedication to historical accuracy. However, brief flashes of genius cannot hide the film's only too numerous flaws. Kris Kristofferson gives a lifeless lead performance and even master actors to the class of Jeff Bridges and a bizarrely miss-cast Brad Douriff seem to struggle aimlessly to find a relevant plot point to chew upon. John Hurt adds swagger to a tissue paper thin persona, but overall his appearance is as redundantly pointless as his woefully miss-judged exit. A young and almost unrecognisably handsome Christopher Walken ends up carrying the majority of the film on his shoulders, and even a pre-famed Mickey Rourke pops up briefly only to die tragically moments later. The time dedicated to the uninteresting romance between the three leads severely jeopardised the entire motivation of the story, and one is left wondering whether the whole thing could have been cut down to perhaps 15% of the runtime instead of the long winded 75. The heavy handed editing is in fact the feature's biggest downfall. With Cimino in full control, his obsession with excess is no less than devastating, and five hours and twenty two minutes is not a movie by any length of chalk; it's a bloated mini-series. All in all, Heaven's Gate is a tough title to judge. At times beautiful and compelling and in others pointless and lengthy, over the years it has gained as many fans as it has critics for its discrepancies in reviews and acclaim. The Deer Hunter may have had scenes that just acted as wallpaper without moving the plot anywhere, but it was saved by strong performances and a story that was much clearer, more coherent and easy to follow. Kris Kristofferson is no Robert Deniro and Isabelle Huppert isn't Meryl Streep either, which didn't make things any easier when Heaven's Gate finally showed up at box offices to strong anticipation. But in its favour, David Mansfield's score is unmissible and viewers will be rewarded by the over powering beauty of the cinematography. For serious cinema lovers, Heaven's Gate is worth a look, if only to see the film that sunk a studio &#150; the last of its kind.

Cimino basically takes a real historical incident and grafts a neo-Marxist framework on it to create your typical Greedy Industrialists vs. Hard-Working Western Folk story that was done with more depth and ingenuity in Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller. I've got no problem with leftist pontificating -- Godard's films are among my favorites -- but Cimino more or less saves it for the end and occupies the remaining three or so hours with what is more or less your traditional, antiquated love triangle, with loads of nudity, a graphic rape scene, and tons of gore which were seemingly included simply to ramp up the film's commercial potential (which isn't too far from the truth). Other, less significant problems serve to bring this lumbering oxcart further down into the mire, such as the scenes at Harvard, which are pathetic not only because Kristofferson is desperately trying to look like a man in his young 20s (looking even less convincing than Diana Ross as Dorothy in The Wiz) but because it was filmed at Oxford, which has never had so much as one jot of resemblance to Harvard. I feel kind of sorry for Cimino; I still think the guy had some untapped talent that was never realized thanks to this film's critical and commercial savaging.

For reasons I can't figure out, Cimino felt it necessary to show the close relationship of John Hurt and Kris Kristofferson before the main action of the film and included an elaborate Harvard graduation sequence. I'm not sure why the whole 45 minutes or so wasn't cut from the film. Maybe it was to show that at least one sheriff in the old west had a Harvard degree.Be that as it may, we next find sheriff Kristofferson objecting mightily to the Cattleman's Association forming a private army under the lead of his predecessor in office, Sam Waterston. Hurt is one of the members of that association now. Cattle rustling they say is running rampant.According to a Wikipedia article on the Johnson County War, the snowy year of 1888 was the root cause of the problem. It killed so much stock and left the cattlemen were very thinned out herds.It also left a lot of small ranchers and farmers, many of them immigrants, starving on the plains. They took to killing stray cattle just to keep from starving. The cattleman reacted like the nobles in Merrie Old England did when the peasants killed the king's deer.Since the small ranchers and farmers had the numbers, they controlled Johnson County and these offenses were lightly dealt with. Not good enough for the big shots in Cheyenne. They organized this punitive expedition to restore law and order as they interpreted the term. As Gabby Hayes said in Tall in the Saddle, he's for law and order depending on who's dishing it out.That's roughly where Wikipedia and Heaven's Gate are in agreement. After that Cimino is kind of loose with his facts on both sides. Still the spirit of anarchy in sparsely populated Johnson County, Wyoming is captured in the film.One incident that is captured verbatim is the killing of Christopher Walken's character Nate Champion who led the small ranchers and farmers of Johnson County. What you see there is what actually happened.Isabelle Huppert plays prostitute Ella Watson true life character who exchanged stolen cattle for a poke as they called in the old West or at least in Breakhart Pass. She's a major star in French cinema and returned there after the beating Heaven's Gate took with American critics. She's very good in the part, but the real Ella Watson was lynched by the Cattleman's Association, not what you see here. Ditto for Kris Kristofferson's character.Best performance in the film by far though is Sam Waterston. The difference between his character Frank Cantone and Jack McCoy is deep and broad, yet curiously enough they're both about Law and Order. Cantone has minimal regard for the rules of evidence though. Waterston's performance is absolutely chilling.The action sequences in the final battle are among the best ever staged. Too bad it took so long to get to it though.

But the film took great license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and Elle were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war, was to start it by being hanged. Well, by starting it, I mean it came at the beginning, not the end. Here's the real scenario James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. By filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused.Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in trade for lewd acts'. In the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. So much for this part of the myth of the American West, which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years.In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, taken in hand, and promptly hanged. Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion, and the start of the Johnson County war.Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the end. Other than that, I think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing.

It is true that the film was criticized more because of what it had become than for what it was.By the films release, many of the details of the films 1 & 1/2 year shooting cycle and vast cost overruns for what amounted to little more than vanity that bankrupted United Artists, were the stuff of cinematic urban legend. (There is much, much more, brilliantly documented in a book titled Final Cut, by Steven Bach).But looking at the film today as a single entity, what exists is less about reality than about art and the vanity of creativity. It's not so much a what had been done than about it could be done. Is Cimino really at fault here? United Artist didn't pull the plug because Dear Hunter earned a bucket full of Oscars. So who is more vain, the director with the blank check or the executive who hands the check over with visions or more buckets full of golden statues.I said before, Heaven's Gate is more of an experimental film than a full-fledged narrative. It is set-piece cinema at its best, designed and digested more as vignettes than in one full swing, much like one would return to a painting over and over again, finding new imagery and imagination with every showing.No doubt Cimino was partially influenced by Kubrick or Kurosawa, while still trying to find his own unique and American Voice. Okay, perhaps Cimino shouldn't have purchased land in Montana with Studio money. Perhaps he really didn't need to throw a huge party after exceeding one million feet of film shot. And doing over 50 takes of a drunken Kristofferson using his whip seems rather excessive.All in all, this film is worth your time. I hesitate to say that the film could have been better. Certainly, it could have been shorter, more historically accurate, and scripted better but, then, it would not be the failed masterpiece it is.Give the film a break.

At not that far short of four hours in length, this taxes the fortitude of the viewer in no uncertain terms.  Had Michael Cimino listened to what people had to say, and exercised a fair degree of vigor in slashing probably one hundred minutes of unnecessary footage from the film during the editing process, the result just might have been the minor classic he was obviously aiming for.  For lurking in this turgid piece of meandering is actually the rudiments of a good story and a potentially good film.

I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like.The full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves.The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. Shots of people in a city that go on much too long with no purpose in the narrative. We get beautiful vistas and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes but they are used too frequently as a place holder instead of as punctuation or to set a place. Much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good.I've attempted to actually sit down and watch Heavens Gate with out resorting to the Fast Forward button but somewhere along the way I find I can't stand it any more.I wish MGM would take pity on us and release the shorter version to DVD as well as the huge dinosaur.

A beautiful contrast between luxury and high life - finally achieving all the power and money most strive for, or is expected from a Harvard education, but their vapid emotional connection and lives seemed to only need several minutes to sum it up. Especially when the mountainous emotional peaks and trenches throughout the rest of the film were so powerful, it's strong signal on how the dream - that which all are striving to achieve (money, power, beautiful wife) don't often allow for an emotionally fulfilling life, or anything that is interesting enough to comment on.

This film was hell to make.","Date":"20 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":" This notorious, big-budget epic film was a major financial disaster for its studio, United Artists. It pretty much, bankrupted them for a very long time. The reasons why are very clear. There were major setbacks in the film's production due to cost and time overruns, negative press, and rumors about director Michael Cimino's allegedly overbearing directorial style. It also didn't help that western movies weren't that popular in the 1980s. The film became the biggest flop in film history at the time. Only grossing $3.5 million domestically (from an estimated $44 million budget). Following its initial release in late 1980, the film was pulled from theatres, edited down, and re-released a few months later, although it still failed miserably. UA's corporate parent, Transamerica, was forced to sell the bankrupted studio to MGM for only $350 million as a result. Loosely based on the historical event of the Johnson County War (1889&#x96;1893), and told in the point of view of Marshall James 'Jim' Averill (Kris Kristofferson), the expensive film tells the story of conflict between starving Eastern European immigrant farmers and the mercenaries hired by the cattlemen to drive them out of their lands. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the worst thing about this movie is the overlong run time with its editing problems. It takes forever to get the story started with this movie! I just glad, the overlong film pace was cut down to 219 minutes, rather than the origin 5 hour version. You really don't miss much, between that version and the Director Cut. If you take away, the college graduation dance, the roller skating party and the battle scenes, this movie is mostly boring. Another thing, I really didn't like the movie is the allegations of animal abuse. Hearing that many of horses were killed and many more injured during the battle scene is disturbing. Even, the accusations of actual cockfights, decapitated chickens, and a group of cows disemboweled to provide fake intestines for the actors is pretty gruesome to hear. The public outcry prompted the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) to contractually authorize The American Humane Association (AHA) to monitor the use of all animals from now on, in all filmed media. This is why, the common use of the No animals were harmed ... disclaimer has return to American cinema credits. Another big thing, the film fails to do, is be, historical accuracy. There were large differences from actual history, like how there was small numbers of settlers arriving in northern Wyoming, compare to masses of exile, poor European immigrants of the film. Also, the fact that Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) was not a enforcer for the stockmen and a murderer, but in real-life, well-liked small rancher in Johnson County, whom honestly, fought against the cattlemen should had been explore more. The biggest change in history was Jim Averill, who in real-life was not a Marshal, but a small-time rancher. Along with his common-law wife Ellen (or Ella) Watson, he was murdered by rich stockmen two years before the Johnson County War even began. Also, the fact that Ella (Isabelle Huppert) had exchanged sexual favors for stolen cattle, was mostly false. It's most unlikely that Watson or Averell ever knew Nate Champion at all. Despite the history, not being accuracy, the changes, do still work as a means of telling a story. In my opinion the movie isn't as bad, as people make it out to be, it was still somewhat watchable if you have the time. The acting was surprising, alright, despite all the critics, saying all of the actors were miscasting. Don't know, about them, but I love seeing, John Hurt, Jeff Bridges, Sam Waterston, Terry O'Quinn, Tom Noonan, Mickey Rourke and Willem Dafoe in all of their roles. The only one, I got a problem with is Isabelle Huppert. I don't remember, reading Ellen Liddy Watson being so French, who barely spoke English who has barely any chemistry with her co-star. Her role was a bit puzzling. One thing that I got mixed feelings for, is the music by composer, David Mansfield. The theme song sounds more like a mafia movie than a western. Its unique sound is interesting, but pretty jarring. Also, the marketing for this movie isn't accurate at all. The love story between Ellen Watson and Jim Averill is only a subplot of the film, not the whole movie. The majority of the movie is about death-list with the romantic scenes, badly edited on. I don't think, seeing a movie with rape, graphic murder, and violence as a romantic date movie. Yet, as a viewer, I didn't mind, the expensive on-location shooting and fastidious over-attention to detail. Yes, it must had been a pain in the butt to film, but the film is too well-shot and beautiful by cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond to complain, too much about it. I can care less, if the film budget balloon almost six times above-budget to produce (from $7.5 million to about $44 million). It's not my lost as an audience viewer. However, I do hate the fact that it ended the reign of the New Wave of 1970's 'auteurs' or independent film-makers, as studios gave more control to producers, than the directors. It took years for Oscar Winner, Michael Cimino to find work, after the disaster of this film. Overall While this film received numerous Razzie Award & a whole cult named after it, it's not the worst movie, I have ever saw. It's mediocre at best. Still, I can't recommended watching.

Books have been written about it.The plot is relatively simple. The Cattleman's Association decides to kill off more than a hundred immigrant squatters on their land. They have the assistance of the law and the cavalry. Kris Kristofferson is the local sheriff or something who tries to save them and loses a couple of friends, including Isabelle Huppert, and semi-friends, including Christopher Walken, in the process.If you want examples of what I mean about scenes being overlong or unnecessary, take the very beginning and the very end.

It was filmed at enormous expense at Oxford in England. It has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the movie. If it had been at all important, the base could have been touched with a few words of dialog. Why, hello, James. Heard from the the Hasty Pudding lately? Or, How's the gang from Harvard, you rich, well-educated, misplaced bastard?The last scene is shot on Kristofferson's sumptuous yacht at Newport, Rhode Island. He enters a spacious bedroom decorated in chintz where an attractive, spiritless young woman is sprawled sleeping on a couch. She asks for a cigarette and he gives her one, then he climbs the ladder to the deck and looks reflectively out to sea. I don't think he says more than a word or two, if that.The movie almost broke the studio and ruined several people near the top, including Michael Cimino. You need characters who hold the interest of the audience. It doesn't matter whether your budget opens up new vistas (Lawrence of Arabia) or is merely enough to get the job done (She Wore A Yellow Ribbon).

Huge props for realism, but you need to be the Rocky Balboa of film buffs to go the distance with this one.EDIT The running length of the film is not 324 mins, more like 219. I have subsequently read up on the Johnson County War; Cimino definitely took some liberties with actual events (Kristofferson & Hupppert's character were dead already before the main shooting began; President Harrison never sanctioned the cattlemen's slaughter of immigrants...). One further thing I learned is that the woman on the yacht in the final scene is not Ella. I thought she had survived the shooting but was perhaps paralyzed thus reclined on the sofa. The non-Ella actress looked enough like Ella (white female aged with make-up) that it wasn't clear to me. I see this as another example of the director being too subtle thus losing overall clarity.

I saw a poster which said the only thing our lead is more passionate about than America is his lover... that is a complete and total lie. Lets put aside that Kris Kristofferson and Isabelle Huppert don't have much chemistry on screen, I never got the feeling this movie about patriotism. In fact the Johnson County War is not an event that made America look good.We follow the story of Kristofferson's character Avrill who leaves a wealthy life out east to go the newly formed states out west. He runs into an old friend of his played by John Hurt who's character's name I forget but don't worry, he does nothing important and does not worth remember until towards the end when he kind of goes insane. Basically wealthy cattle owners are not happy with the immigrants who they think are stealing their livestock. Movie probably explains this but I was so bored I probably tuned this.Things don't go well and a lot of people die and disillusioned Avrill goes home.I wouldn't mind the long run time (though I question a battle scene that was original long enough to be a feature length film on its own). But in so many scenes it feels like nothing is happening that is advancing the plot and the characters are so poorly developed that I kind of don't care what happens to them. I wouldn't have learned any of their names if it wasn't for the fact these are actors I really like (I still can't get over Sam Watterson's mustache). With a movie like this, we really need to see an idealistic youth that the audience really sympathize with just watch his hopes and dreams get destroyed, maybe even violated. Also some scenes seem to happen with no connection between them but that might have something to do with the more than two hours that were cut (from a movie that was nearly 3 hours at release).It's also hard to ignore that this movie was pretty reckless and several horses were injured or traumatized. One horse was even blown up and that scene was in the original cut of movie... why they thought that was a good idea I have no idea. There are some scenes like where a carriage crashes and flips over that looks so realistic I seriously wonder if that was a real accident and they left it in (since it also feels kind of random).I will defend David Mansfield's soundtrack to my dying breath. I adore the scene where he rides around on roller skates while playing the Cajon tune Mamou Two-Step.I can't recommend you watch this movie. It's so close to being a great movie, but just falls into the uncanny valley and I consider that to be the greatest tragedy... after the blown up horse.

I was a fan of Micheal Cimino's The Deer Hunter and also Year Of The Dragon before watching this one. I was always reluctant to view this because of its famous scathing from critics. I believe this film was given harsh criticism even before its release and it never was given the chance to warm to the public. I agree with some that it is very long and some scenes are a complete waste of time costing United Artists loads of money. I believe Michael Cimino tried too hard to make a masterpiece film with Heavens Gate. Cimino's ego was becoming bigger in the process of becoming an Oscar winning Director The films best points are its cinematography, it looks superb and its music. It is a very boring story but I guess most Westerns are at times. I've seen it once now and perhaps won't revisit this rather boring film. I found it like reading a long novel that you just can't get into.

This opens with the Harvard graduation scene that had no purpose whatsoever. The ending was pretty lame too. Kristofferson is a noble character in theory but we can't care about him. In fact none of the characters were particularly interesting. The photography was god awful.The entire time it looked like the film was shot in a smoke filled bar, even the outside shots were unbearably hazy. When making a film that is sure to take more than three hours, don't have any scene that doesn't accomplish anything. This is the rule for all films but the cardinal rule for these epics. Not a scene in Lawrence of Arabia or Godfather or Apocalypse Now was unnecessary, they were all important and all brilliant. Heavens Gate on the other hand is over produced garbage, nothing more than a handful of vignettes tied together only by taking place in the Wild West, made by a man that will never make another good movie in his life. Watch the Deer Hunter, it was brilliant. Check out Thunderbolt and LIghtfoot, it was a lot of fun, skip Heaven's gate.

Heaven's Gate was the egg laid by respected director Michael Cimino, which ultimately destroyed one of the most famous movie studios in movie history. I almost cannot put into words how bloody confusing this movie is in terms of reaction. I must ultimately ask this question many ask when they see it. Heaven's Gate A grand true epic film, or a trip into he unchecked ego of Hollywood? Ultimately, the conclusion I drew was that Heaven's Gate is a gloriously shot but overlong mess.The story, based on historical fact, dramatizes the Johnson County Cattle Wars of 1890. Marshall Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) a man born into wealth in the midst of European settlers, tries to keep order despite and impending tragedy. The rich cattle barons of the state of Wyoming, led by Canton (Sam Waterston) create a death list of each settler in the county to prevent anarchy cattle theft. All the while Averill woos local bordello madam Ella (Isabelle Huppert) despite her similar attraction to Baron hit-man Champion (Christopher Walken) The premise seems simple to follow, but that is only a summary of this nearly three and a half hour movie. In fact, most of the film is empty shots of people quite literally doing nothing of importance. The problem is director Michael Cimino. The film is lacking what it so richly deserves, evoking emotion within the viewer. When there is a five minute scene of people obscured by dust and incomprehensible dialog, the viewer ultimately becomes frustrated, not subversively challenged to get up to speed to understand it. There are numerous subplots Cimino includes in his script, and while some are decent enough, like Jeff Bridges character opening a roller skating rink called Heaven's Gate, the rest are ultimately and sadly pointless. Two perfect examples are completely unnecessary prologue and epilogue sequences which add nothing at all to the impact of the movie, in fact in my opinion they hurt the movie's flow and central idea.The budget of this movie has become stuff or movie lore, forty-four million dollars on a movie that could have been made for at least three quarters of it. Most of it was spent on Cimino's relentless attention to mostly unnecessary details. But, with that said, the movie is BEAUTIFUL. One of the brilliant choices Cimino made on this movie was the selection of legendary DP Vilmos Zsigmond. The vistas and wide shots are like beautiful oil paintings put to film. Zsigmond is the master of lighting, and it truly shows in this film. Sometimes I got lost looking at the lighting and shadows created. The sets, however expensive they were, are also gorgeous. I can at least say that this movie is not cheap looking at all, every penny seems to be on the screen.What ultimately makes this movie a dud is Cimino's lack of idea what this movie is supposed to be. It was trying to be the greatest movie ever made, but it tried much too hard. Much too hard to the point where one cannot latch on to anyone or anything in the movie, which is what we as a viewer are supposed to do. While it is a pretty movie, it runs far too long to have a cohesive story and not much interesting development in the characters.I do believe that this movie deserves at least one or two viewings to catch what may have been missed the first time around. However i wouldn't go putting it on the top ten list of anything, or the top 100 for that matter. Ultimately, Heaven's Gate is the scorned child of a director who went too far without really going anywhere to begin with.

That feeling has been sustained and enhanced until the end. As a non-American viewer, this great film gives me an understanding of some American cultures and sub-cultures, including the passion for guns and self-protection. Any country with that kind of beginning cannot simply shake out the inhabited violence in the historical bloodstream. The plot of this film is simple and focused, yet one feels one can understand the entire history of the formation years. Much like a tiny Japanese garden that reflects the wilderness at large. Hatred to this film, based on the hated towards its director Michael Cimino and the allegations of the film's all-around failure, has effectively disillusioned the viewers for decades. On its merit, the film is decent and very well-made, regardless to how much it cost to get made. Having known or not the making of this film, which involves, madly, hundreds of takes for each shot, soon enough one realizes the great painting-like quality of the picture. While watching Heaven's Gate, my mind wanders to The Godfather Part 2, which I find very much in the same level in terms of production. However, Heaven's Gate is a lesser film to that one when it comes to acting depth and dramatic effects. Cimino intends to create a perfect film, and instead he throws himself into the logistical side of the film and forgets to arouse the audience adequately. Anyhow, I encourage everyone to watch this film. As a Buddhist, I realize that hatred breeds stupidity. See how many years have passed before anyone starts to really get to watch Heaven's Gate as a film and not as a flop.

It's extremely well-shot, presenting a sepia-toned, almost impressionistic view of late 19th Century Western American life full of horses, trains, whiskey and cockfights in likely a more flattering light than they deserve. Still, this movie is a) too reliant on pretty imagery and Americana nostalgia, and b) too long.

There are scenes, whole sequences in fact, in this movie that rival any classic epic western, made in America or any spaghetti western. The crowd scenes are unbelievable. The recreations of the western towns and dwellings are superb. The color tones are well-chosen.The acting and directing (Michael Cimino) are high quality. They are not of the highest caliber that one finds in classic westerns, but they suffice. They do not bring down the picture, but neither are they capable of elevating it beyond the limitations of the story. With help, Kris Kristofferson might have been able to transcend the story's limitations but he was not afforded that help from the script.The primary challenge of the movie and its main failing is to give us a weak and ineffectual central character played by Kristofferson, the sheriff. He's not shown as tragic. It's not circumstances that doom his project, for he has no project. He's no hero. He's a bystander much of the time, or else avoiding trouble and doing nothing when a hero or even a man of ordinary courage would be doing something. He cannot and does not commit to any cause, even his own. That's taking an anti-hero pretty far. Can a movie succeed at that? This one tries. Ultimately, it leaves us disappointed.The die is cast at the outset in which John Hurt presents a valedictory speech at Harvard. He's Kristofferson's alter ego, or the philosopher or chorus that represents Kristofferson, and the philosophy is to do nothing, to leave matters alone on the assumption that they are arranged well enough. It's not nihilism. It's not skepticism. It's disassociation. It's denial of the human striving. It's closest to enervating pessimism. It's barren of any ideals. The recreation of Harvard is disappointing because the film actually uses Oxford and Cambridge in England for backdrops. Anyone familiar with Harvard will see this immediately.Cimino's film was apparently re-edited. We get some long scenes for no apparent purpose. These are a waltz scene at Harvard that goes on endlessly, a roller skating scene in Wyoming, and the final battle scene with endless circling and killing.Otherwise, the anti-hero played by Kristofferson mostly wanders around between town and bordello where he beds the madame to whom he cannot commit. Christopher Walken, who does commit, does not fare as well as the anti-hero. So much for heroism. When Kristofferson belatedly tries to help the settlers in the battle against the ranchers and state, organized by Sam Waterston, he encounters a rowdy bunch of disunited and ignorant immigrants. They have plenty of roller skates. They can shout and get angry. But they can't organize and plan an attack on their foes. They are portrayed as lacking all good sense. Even their choice of location and occupation is senseless. They are in the middle of nowhere, on land not suited for farming, and many are surviving only by theft of cattle. The cattle barons are equally senseless. They can find no way of handling the situation except wholesale slaughter of cattle thieves.It is hard to engage in a story that presents human beings as so flawed, so incapable, so merciless, and so incapable of handling their affairs. Can an epic succeed when the entire story revolves around human failings taken to a degree that defies belief? Cimino is perhaps intent on revisiting the Vietnam disillusionment but in a different setting. The idea is to condemn ordinary people for their failure to get together, even in their own defense, or against a state-confirmed evil, for we are told repeatedly that the governor and even the president approve of the cattlemen's hunting down and killing of cattle thieves. Is a man's life worth a steer? It condemns potential heroes and those who stand passively by and fail to commit, even when it's their responsibility. Kristofferson quits as sheriff when under pressure. He makes no attempt to organize the people who outnumber the cattlemen's hired guns.Ultimately, the story is disappointing, even if the themes are viable. The story is not constructed in a way that enjoins the participation and identification of its audience. Bitterness and condemnation do not grab one, not by themselves. They are too one-sided. The stupidity of the settlers' attack is beyond belief. They become like Indians, circling and being shot. What's the point? That they lack the savvy to produce political institutions that can contend with the cattleman's association? They are like the poor villagers in Seven Samurai who look for defenders, and all they have is a weak Kristofferson. Pity them.Mickey Rourke has a small part. Cimino would go on to direct him in Year of the Dragon, which is quite a good movie. But Cimino would then not direct again until 2007.

Then at the end you're left hunting for the point of many plot aspects. Why did this happen, and why did we see that when it seemed to have no bearing on the story? After so long in your seat you could be forgiven for feeling these loose ends should have and could have all been tied up to everyone's satisfaction, no matter who convoluted they might be.What you do get is a 220 minute art movie with some of the most sumptuous images ever committed to celluloid. Fantastic sets, fabulous scenery, wonderful camera-work, great composition and atmosphere you can taste, but a storyline that needed far more substance to sustain the extraordinary original length. The preamble, set in Harvard (filmed in Oxford, England) and the final sequence set on a millionaire's yaucht in Chesapeake Bay , seem out of place. Yes they look great,but they go on and on... The college waltz scene is wonderful to watch, but it contribute enough story to warrant so much screen time? The full-length college speech by John Hurt's character is simply overlong and tedious in the extreme. The same can be said for much of the battle sequence, which itself was originally edited to run longer than the length of an entire normal feature film. Quite why is hard to imagine.It's already repetitious as it is. Of the actors, Hurt is good but has little to do, Kristofferson is gritty, moody, gruff and very well cast indeed, the much-maligned Isabelle Huppert, playing the brothel-madam is actually rather wonderful. The famous negative quote was that she looked like a potato. Well she's the prettiest darn potato I ever saw! Her accent, the source of great pre production strife, is of no importance at all to the movie. So she sounds French? So what? She's radiantly photographed, acts well and fits the part. What else did they want? (Sally Field apparently!) Walken's character is very odd, his make up even odder (eye liner?) and why is the love triangle so poorly defined despite the time it takes to unfold? Bridges as the saloon/rink-owner is excellent but again his part in the plot is poorly stated... The music is great too.The roller-skating fiddle player you see in the rink is the composer. So much talent for one so young. It's just such a shame about the flaws in the screenplay, as the whole film looks so good frame-for-frame! David Lean himself would have struggled to better the imagery, but he'd have tightened up the story and probably brought the movie in for half the eventual cost and half an hour shorter! For all that it remains well worth anyone's while to watch - I've seen it three times - it's not a film that lets go of me, which says something for it, or me!

Sure, on principle, everything could be done, and it almost was. Indeed the story of the making of the film is what is on anyone/everyone's mind when it comes to this film, which is the poster child for cinematic (that is auteur) excess in Hollywood, where a director who was too high on himself following just two films- one of them a best picture/director winner- gave him carte blanche to do anything.The ultimate shame was that Cimino was a good director who just became way too full of himself, and while not entirely his fault- certainly studio encouragement to indulge didn't help- the spiraling of an originally 7-8 million Western to 36 to 40 million made it a scandal celebre. That it sunk a studio is almost besides the point; it was used as THE example by Hollywood, already looking for an excuse for producers to take over and big tent-pole movies to reign, as to how artists were out of control. It is a notorious case, and certainly far from a flawless movie. Some, indeed, would say it is all-around, from its making to how it turned out, why the word 'fiasco' was created.And yet coming to the film some thirty years later, looking at it in its full 219 minute 'lust for glory' version, (not the 5 hour version, doesn't exist anymore), it can be looked at with fresh eyes, particularly from someone not alive when it was released. How does it stand as a film, on its own legs as it were? Well... it's not bad, really, not at all. What's good about it turns out to more often than not be mesmerizing, fascinating and fully epic in scope. In Cimino's mix of history and personal style, of a deconstructive look at how the West Was Won in a story of the Johnson County Wars, where immigrants were looked upon as anarchist rebels who had to be 'taken out' by the establishment who didn't want them in Wyoming, it's ambitious to say the least. It's got a dash of War & Peace with the violent velocity of Peckinpah at his nastiest and the captivating eye of Vilmos Zsigmond as director of Photography.Indeed if nothing else the film is completely gorgeous to look at. In that department Cimino spared no expense for good purpose, and many of the shots of Wyoming mountains and fields, and how he uses sepia and brown and dust in the shots is nothing short of a miracle. And the music is also, often, very sad and heartfelt, and sometimes very uplifting like in the masterful roller-rink dance sequence (both parts, the chaotic mass of people skating around to an upbeat tune, and then the slow-turning-fast crescendo of the song being played to James and Ella dancing by themselves). And the final battle sequence(s), when all told at about half an hour to forty-five minutes in length, is extraordinary to experience visceral, wild, out of control but seen with an eye and pace and passion that is almost enough to recommend the picture wholeheartedly... well, almost.Where does the picture come into trouble? On a few key points really. It's not that the script is always a bother, but when Cimino isn't focusing on the key plot, about the 'death list' that the Association has cooked up, or on the really necessary moments of James/Nathan/Ella's relationship (as strained as it can sometimes be, written that is, not so much performed since Walken and Huppert are terrific together), it meanders a lot, and there's only so much time that one spends with the one-dimensional immigrants that one tires of them. It's like, we get it immigrants, good, Association, bad. Gotcha. But sometimes, as sometimes happened in The Deer Hunter as well, Cimino has to put words in people's mouths when they're not needed (or, perhaps, just not the right words). A shame since an actor like Sam Waterston, when he's given something good, really nails it. Same with John Hurt, at least in his early scenes, before he becomes a strange parody, a guy who doesn't want any part of the War but staggers around making poetic declarations like a sage or something.Two other problems the length of certain scenes and sequences, and Kris Kristofferson. For the latter, I should mention that I like Kristofferson as an actor but here he seems sort of miscast as the main hero of the story (and, had Cimino cast an actual star who could carry the film much better, the B.O. would've fared slightly better). For the former... well, I wouldn't want to see the film any other way, as it is his director's cut, but in this cut, one can see what did and definitely didn't work in the pacing. It's almost as if Cimino filmed into a corner, and could only keep the pace as it was, at least in his mind. That he also lets the sound mix, ala Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller, become muddled and with one having to strain to sometimes hear the actors amid background noise, is a further annoyance.The pros for the film are high, almost, perhaps, in spite of what does not work in Cimino's 'final cut'. It's also interesting as an artifact of excess like James Cameron's Avatar, all of the money is up there on the screen, and it's a little painful to watch here and there, or a Western Xanadu built by CF Kane. History hasn't done the film favors, and it shouldn't, but it's a better movie than you've heard.

That's a new record for me!Now to all you movie nerds out there foaming at the bit and shouting YOU DIDN'T GIVE THIS MASTERPIECE A CHANCE, YOU PHILISTINE, my reply is Wanna bet?.When I woke up and saw I had missed most of the film, I felt so guilty I even started the film over just to give it a fair go. 3 and a half hours later, I was SO glad I had only spent $2.50 NZ for a week's rental to rent this 'paint drying' movie! It could have EASILY been cut in half and still got it's point across.But it wasn't.So what you're left with is a 3 and a half hour watching grass grow movie. Sure it was authentic looking grass but no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't hide the fact... it's still only grass! 3 and a half hour, authentic looking, long winded grass!What do I rate this film? I don't rate movies by stars usually. I have a different way of rating movies. Using my system, there are 7 levels of rating. The highest rating is 'See it several times at the movies'. The lowest rating is 'wait till it comes out on TV so you can miss it then'.Heavens Gate is one level up from that lowest rating. I give it a Watch it on TV rating (just as long as it is shown in widescreen. The production team deserve at least that for thier fine work). But for the rest of it, I'd take Glory or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly over Heavens Gate any day of the week.

The critics prefer 90 minute Barbara Streisand movies. WATCH THIS FILM. It is slow-paced, and deliberately so, but few knock 2001. I always thought that if you like a film enough you wish you could see the five-hour cut. Beyond all of this, Jeff Bridges, in an interview with Mark Cousins, stated the obvious when he said that the budget is all up on screen - a lavish epic. The money did not go to waste in my opinion. The story is about something important, not frivolous as many longer films have been. I would go to see a film with John Hurt and Chris Walken tomorrow, no qualms. See for yourself.

Now I am NOT saying it's THE worst film ever--but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it, this is a very, very bad film.I would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer/director, Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person. Had he not been so self-indulgent, a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes--saving the studio millions! The film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at Harvard. The scene is HUGE but completely without context. You have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students (in particular, John Hurt) are behaving so boorishly. I find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870--and it looks a lot more like 1970. This is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening, who the characters are or their motivations. The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard grads (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is....well, what IS John Hurt in the film?!?! He just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? His entire character made no sense. They never explained why he was a Brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with the hired army IF he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable, though having him move to Wyoming AND risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all.This brings up the worst aspect of HEAVEN'S GATE. While the scenes are WAY TOO LONG and needed trimming, the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. In fact, other than Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the clich√©) and perhaps Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you don't know or understand the characters. Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very, very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of FOOD. Maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink, the farmers could have afforded to BUY food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! And what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? What did this have to do with a land war? The most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very, very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film. There are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness. So much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs, many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film.As for the final battle, it was done reasonably well but had problems. First, this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion!! Second, while details of the actual events of the so-called Johnson County War are a tad sketchy, we do know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson never actually were there, as they'd both been hung BEFORE the battle. Third, I can't believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle. While I am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve Cimino's vision for the film is very sad.Finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. While it is blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who appears to be one that Kris looked at a couple times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome. I read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong.Overall, to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying WWII was a minor tiff. Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you factor in the cost of production, I truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history.Finally, when a film has this much explicit nudity I warn parents. However, as no child COULD sit through this film (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.

It started out OK, faithfully recreating the wild celebratory atmosphere of graduation of the class of '70 at Harvard College, you would think, with lots of noise & movement, which you could excuse for drowning out much of the dialogue & disorienting the viewer. But it soon became obvious that this technical approach of enhancing background sounds to compete with the dialogue & keeping the camera constantly moving, panning, zooming in, craning over, hovering, was a feature of the rest of the film which made hearing the speaking parts almost impossible, & the storyline itself hard to follow. Moreover the constant movement of the camera while the characters themselves were in motion in the scene made it frustrating if not impossible to follow the action, most of which was blurred & out of focus, let alone get a clear image of their faces to gauge their expressions. And the scenes themselves were badly framed, the lighting in the indoor scenes was poor & ineffective, & again, the most irrelevant sounds, like the strike of billiard balls, or the clink of china tea cups, for example, were amplified dB's above the dialogue. The outdoor scenes were just as disappointing with nearly every scene shot through either smoke or dust, some with crane shots for effect, & the cinematography failed to do justice to magnificent landscape of Wyoming. All in all this was an excruciating film to sit through, nauseating at times in its audio-visual excesses, & exasperating in its pedestrian script. Pity, because the story itself concerned a very important event in American history with regard to notion of the US government becoming an instrument of the landed & wealthy against the poor & dispossessed. Although in the end the film did manage to convey the violence of the conflict between the immigrants & the wealthy landowners, & the divided loyalties of Christofer Walken's character for his bosses on the one hand, & his own people, on the other, at times, it looked like turning into a ridiculous, self-indulgent mess, which was best exemplified by the mass gunfight scene near the end in which, amidst all the shooting, dozens of people were killed or maimed while riding horseback, but with the exception of one, no horse was actually shot, with all those stray bullets flying everywhere & sticks of dynamite going off all around them. As it was, the only two good things this film had going for it were, Isabelle Huppert's cute accent & her shapely body in all its natural beauty, & for genuine humor, the scene in which Trapper Fred grabs Mickey Rourke's tongue to demonstrate how he can catch a wolf with his bare hands. 2/10!

First thing to notice is the length of the movie. Depending on the version, this movie runs over 3 hours long. It can be quite meandering, confusing, and unnecessarily lengthy. Cimino did not make any attempt to trim much. The biggest problem I have with the budget is that it's not an obviously big budget movie. Sure there are a lot of people in costumes, but it's not thousands of soldiers battling on the field. The fact is if 10 people was enough, Cimino would want 100. And if 100 was enough, he'd want 1000. And if something fake could be used, he'd want the real deal. There are definitely big expensive scenes. But it's mostly Cimino's hubris that he's making something bigger than a simple movie.The most obvious example is the 3 circling scenes. Storytelling doesn't require all 3 scenes. However, it's Cimino's need to create historic art that requires all 3. He's not making a movie. He's making high art. The first one around the tree has no value in terms of storytelling. It's the intro, and the movie needs to move faster. A quicker and smaller scene with fewer people would introduce the characters quicker and easier. And with fewer players, it would be more emotionally impactful.The second one was more fun. While not necessary, it's a good scene to have in the middle to provide excitement. Of course, the third is the climax. The excessive dust do obscure too much of the action. The movie is already too many shades of brown, dirt, and dust. However, the money spent for the 3rd circle was more worthwhile.The story is a pretty simple western. Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) is a gunslinger hired by the Stockgrowers Association to kill the new immigrant settlers. There is cattle rustling by these new people to feed their families. James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is a Harvard graduate newcomer and is appalled by the Association's kill list. The two sides would end in a battle for this piece of Wyoming.Although it's an overly long movie, there are individual scenes that are quite compelling and beautiful. Cimino has skills. And Kris Kristofferson has a good screen presence and command his scenes no matter how chaotic. The eye is drawn to him naturally. And Christopher Walken is always a great actor. There is value in this movie, but just not the value the studio put into it.

Having watched and loved Cimino's 'The Deer Hunter' could this film really be as bad as some people have made out; I was intrigued to find out, where my fears from the directors commentary about Cimino being a strange egg going to be confirmed? Well on a recent night when I was having trouble sleeping I stumbled across the so called superior 219 minute version of the movie on television. Well first impressions where quite good the grainy pictures lent a nice earthy feel to the movie and it was clear the director is going for an epic with the large sweeping camera shots. Then we had an interesting opening scene during the graduation of key characters Kris Krisstoferson and John Hurt from their college of very well to do gentlemen in the 1800's in the new America. Then we flash forward some years to the frontier country with Hurt and Krisstoferson part of a gentlemen's organisation that own the cattle and most of the land who are aggrieved that the extremely poor immigrants are stealing their live stock. The film has decent sentiments showing that great American tradition of the rich man keeping the poor man down (okay mow they do not do it with bullets, but hurricane Katrina anyone?) but the film is also a rambling mess of little to no pace. Now I am not opposed to long films. It is just that I feel the length of a film can multiply the effects of a film, whether that be negative or positive, and I am afraid in this case it is most definitely a negative. I rarely had any empathy with any of the characters on either side of the conflict apart from a dislike of the main land owner, Krossoferson left me cold as a hero and Hurt and Christopher Walken seem to be wasted and there are so many immigrant characters that none of them apart from the equally wasted Jeff Bridges get much screen time which leads to no empathy for any of them. We have the sub plot of the Walken, Krisstoferson, Isabella Huppert love triangle but for me nothing really moves me. We have long rambling scenes with dialogue so lost in the mix it is at times virtually inaudible. So we come to the conclusion and yes it bloody and brutal but in the end completely unsatisfactory.

Most of the time, they are far too costly to produce to be anything else. In light of this, it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then. Once in a while, the film-makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this. I'd like to know precisely how it happens that this has often led to both the big studios and some major critics gunning for the picture when it is at last released. Terrible expectations are generated and often what people expect to see clouds their perception of what they are viewing.You can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect, but magnificent '62 re-make 0f Mutiny on the Bounty, and you can definitely see it in the reaction to Heaven's Gate. Cimino took too long and cost United Artists way too much money in making this picture. The company was fatally wounded by his excesses and, no doubt, powerful people were out to see his reputation forever ruined when this strange, mammoth epic was finally released. There are always many film-goers who dislike long, weighty pictures. The storytelling in this film is not accomplished with great economy or a brisk pace. Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often chooses not to spell out the particular statement he is making with a given scene. Rather, he draws it out in such a way as to make the viewer feel like they are living in the moment, providing time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is being presented. A lot of folks don't react all that favorably to this approach. They want the story to move quickly and clearly and they easily become impatient and confused by this sort of film. These factors doubtless contributed to the box-office failure of Heaven's Gate.By nature, a film editor, I am deeply frustrated by two problems with this film. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and could easily have been trimmed without harming its effectiveness. Then we come to the massive, drawn-out battle scenes at the end of the picture. Where these are concerned, the clarity of the storytelling is indeed damaged. If you liked the film up to the point where these occur, your understanding of what is supposed to be happening is likely to become unclear and this is indeed a frustration. Not having seen all the rough footage, I can not tell if actual re-shoots would have been needed, or whether some critical plot elements might have been made clearer by careful re-editing of some moments. Given the time and money that were poured into this picture, more care and thought should have been given to this problem.There are other problems, some occasional weak acting, some dialog that doesn't ring true, but these are really minor concerns. The reason I am so troubled by the problems stated above is that, like so many these days, I too feel that in all Heaven's Gate is so splendid to behold and so magnificently deals with major historic, political and sociological issues that it is just short of a masterpiece. Despite its shortcomings, it is so dramatically and visually powerful that it stands head and shoulders above most other Hollywood films I have ever seen. I'd like to re-mix a lot of the sound. I'd like to re-direct and re-edit the scene where Ella is killed, but the greatness of this picture is such that these considerations really do become trivial when compared with the value of the total production. I should add that it should always be seen on a giant wide screen to achieve the glorious effect that it is so capable of delivering.

It is also said to have brought an end to the period when Hollywood auteurs prevailed over producers and to have killed off the Western (when Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves went over budget in 1990 it was dubbed Kevin's Gate).  The film is in fact, for all its vagueness of characterization, one of the great radical Westerns, dealing in a complex manner with the contradictions of American life and taking the conflicts in the East Coast industrial cities out into the West.  Visually rich, it is a carefully patterned movie, most especially in the way it handles the so-called class traitors Jim Averill and Nate Champion.  Like Luchino Visconti's The Leopard, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900, and Cimino's own The Deer Hunter, it eschews carefully paced narrative in favour of powerfully animated, operatic set-pieces that are often extended beyond what puritanical temperments think proper.

Sure, The Deer Hunter was a magnificent film, but Heaven's Gate is miles beyond it. Like The Deer Hunter, Heaven's Gate deals with how throughout history, community is constantly threatened by hostile, external forces. However, what makes Heaven's Gate a better film than The Deer Hunter (which is also a great film) is the same thing which made DW Griffith's Intolerance better than The Birth of a Nation-- namely, the absence of racism. Like Birth of a Nation, which was made in an era of intense racism against African-Americans, The Deer Hunter was made in a politically conservative decade (the late seventies, the early eighties). This political conservatism was reflected in The Deer Hunter's portrayal of the Vietnamese as murderous barbarians. However, to critique The Deer Hunter in terms of racial issues is to miss its central point-- the importance of community, and the practice of non-violence. Heaven's Gate is also about racism, specifically about the elimination of European immigrants into America at the turn of the century. What makes Heaven's Gate a great film is its attention to detail and authenticity, and its ability to move the audience to both tears and moments of intense euphoria. There are scenes in Heaven's Gate, such as the skating rink-dance sequence, which will linger in your mind long after you've seen the film. There are also scenes which are so horrifying that you want to avert your eyes from the screen, such as the reading off of the names of immigrants to be executed by Kris Kristofferson-- in front of the immigrants. Ultimately, Heaven's Gate, like DW Griffith's Intolerance, is about the need for tolerance and understanding in an age of violence and close-mindedness. No wonder Heaven's Gate was so savagely attacked-- it was released during one of the more conservative decades of American history. To anyone who hasn't seen Michael Cimino's masterpiece, I strongly recommend it.

Many scenes seem to have lingered longer than necessary to achieve the director's desired effect, so the three and a half hour run time required a couple of sit-downs for me rather than the entire film all at once.Watching today I was probably struck by the youthful appearance of the principals more than anything else - Kristofferson, Walken, and an implausibly cast Sam Waterston given his role as the leader of the Stockholders Association. Jeff Bridges certainly didn't look much like Rooster Cogburn either.As is often the case, certain latitude is taken with historical facts in this purported treatment of the 1892 Johnson County War. I often wonder about that, since real life events are certainly as interesting if not more so than the stuff they put up on screen. So it's best to put reality aside and judge a picture on it's face value. This one has gorgeous cinematography as a big plus, with period set pieces that looked astonishingly real. One drawback that I thought might have been my own problem was mentioned by a couple other reviewers, the sound and dialog wasn't the greatest at times, and I had to struggle to understand what characters were saying.

Everyone joined the feeding frenzy--the film was too long, it was wildly over budget, and it was cut to pieces by the studio.However, in 2012, a new 216 minute director's cut was released. You still may not enjoy the movie. However, at least now you can see a coherent, logical film that is worth watching. The movie is far from a docudrama, although it's based on historical events. In 1890, in Wyoming, the rich ranchers with huge holdings decided to drive out the smaller ranchers. They hired a large group of mercenaries to carry out what became known as the Johnson County War. These mercenaries, referred to as the invaders, operated with the approval and support of both the governor and the U.S. President.Kris Kristofferson plays Sheriff James Averill, a Harvard-educated member of the wealthy eastern elite, who sides with the small ranchers. Isabelle Huppert plays Ella Watson, a prostitute, madam, and Averill's lover. (She is faithful to Averill in the sense that every other man has to pay her, but he doesn't.)The movie has some magnificent scenes, such as a fixed gun battle between the small ranchers and the mercenaries. There's also an amazing scene at a roller rink. The name of the rink is Heaven's Gate. (I checked, and roller skating was very popular in Wyoming at the time.)The lovely Isabelle Hubert has no hesitation about displaying her exquisite charms, frequently and fully.The chemistry between Hubert and Kristofferson certainly works on screen. (Either they really did care for each other, or they are such good actors that they could portray love in this realistic fashion.)My suggestion is to forget the hype, buy or rent the 2012 version of the movie, and judge for yourself what Cimino accomplished. The movie will work much better on a large screen, but if DVD is your only option, go for it. I think it's definitely worth seeing. (Personal note my wife and I agree about films about 98% of the time. Heaven's Gate falls within the 2% about which we disagree. She found it tedious, bloody, and too long. She would have given it a rating of 6. I gave it an 8. Fair warning.)

For years I'd heard of it mentioned in Film Studies classes. The film that killed off the writer/director led filmmaking of the 1970s, where filmmakers were basically given blank cheques to make their projects without compromise. & best of all I got to see it on the big screen at the BFI in London! I can't understand how it got atrocious reviews upon its original release. Though I think we're similarly seeing a bit of history repeating with the current Lone Ranger (2013) film that's also being bogged down by dismal reviews. Heaven's Gate is an epic Western in every sense. Widescreen landscapes, physical sets/locations & an epic story that like 'The Deer Hunter' takes its time to show incidental moments in the lives of the characters, that help build an engaging narrative as you become emotionally invested in the characters.I can only comment on the 3 & a half hour cut - as I've never had the opportunity before to see other versions. I'm shocked to think this film once got buried, Cimino deserved the opportunity to make more films like this. The acting is also faultless & the attention to detail in the exterior sets is jaw-dropping. Sad films are no longer made like this - but then this is also the film that (unjustly) brought an end to this style of filmmaking. Thanks to bad reviews & dismal box-office plus budget over-spending. Time to re- discover proper cinema. See it on the silver screen if you can!

Possible spoilers","Date":"6 July 2013","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":" As I watched this much maligned film, I actually did like it and at times, became invested in the sort of class warfare story. There is a deep sadness that flows throughout the whole movie which makes the nearly laugh out loud, ludicrous events toward the end of the film pretty jarring. Its a film that was struggling to find its center and became a bit of a disaster. Still, there's much to be enjoyed here. The movie does not shy away from the grittier facts of the west the whoring, the cock fighting, the straight up government sanctioned slaughter of poor foreigners. I appreciated these aspects told in such blunt fashion. My guess is Dead Wood owes a great deal to this film. The town's people are not really charming or educated. Still, stealing their land and murdering them sickens the normal person even to think about. The main villain is truly despicable. He a corrupt businessman to his core who can hire men to do his killing for him and the association. I found myself wishing him the most horrible death imaginable hopefully at the hands a Slavic farmer. When I truly loathe a villain, I feel the film has succeeded on some level. Honestly, many villains are cardboard cutouts that don't compel much emotion. The acting overall was scatter shot. I'm always a fan of Christopher Walken though the younger version is much more subdued than what he eventually became. Kristofferson growls most of his lines and plays a shut down, drunk overwhelmed by the futility of being a sheriff in a lawless land. John Hurt never seems to do much besides drink himself blind and recite poetry. Mickey Rourke in one of his early roles has an interesting scene but his character (like several others) seemed unnecessary. I will say that the cinematography was excellent in several scenes and worth watching again. We are oddly enough today still faced with the bloated 2 and a half or more hour epics that could obviously have be trimmed of excess fat. Heaven's Gate seems like the granddaddy of a lot of the recent crop and one has to wonder why Criterion saw fit to put out the uncut version at 216 minutes. I definitely fast forwarded through a communal dance scene which then turned into a duo dance scene. Other than that, I made it through the whole film in one evening which at its length says something. Overall, its a flawed film that attempted to do too much with not enough focus. However, failure can often be more interesting than success when a man grasps for sweet inspiration and not just the low hanging fruit. "},{"Title":"HEAVEN'S GATE Not Quite A Masterpiece, But Nowhere Near A Disaster","Date":"21 April 2013","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":" Where to begin?It was a film that was so expensive to make, and such a catastrophic disaster, both with critics and with audiences, that it managed to do three things at once. First, it ended the existence of United Artists as a legitimate studio (it survived only as an arm of Metro Goldwyn Mayer). Secondly, its failure also all but ended the existence of a once-proud film genre, the Western. And thirdly, the litany and avalanche of criticism, gossip, and talk of directorial excess on it virtually closed the shop down on tyro directors who could have their way with the studios and go to town on both budgets and schedules, at least for a good long time.It was Michael Cimino's HEAVEN'S GATE. It was his attempt to make a Western of the scope of past screen epics like GONE WITH THE WIND, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and BEN HUR. And it crashed badly, returning a miserable $1.3 million on a budget of close to $45 million when it opened (for one single weekend) in November 1980 (and re-released in April 1981 in a vastly shortened version, where it didn't do any better).But just how bad of a film is it, in actuality? Compared to other films of more recent times that have either cost much more and failed much worse at the box office, or films that have been hyped up beyond reason and in the end never really delivered, is this really the cataclysm a lot of people make it out to be? In my humble opinion, having seen this film on five different occasions just to convince myself, the answer is No.It has to be conceded that this film, a very loose recreation of the Johnson County range war that raged in the 1890s in Wyoming between European immigrants and ruthless cattle barons, is excessive even for a Western epic the sets are wildly over-sized; the Western towns look dangerously like big cities; numerous individual sequences seem to go on forever, well past reason. All of that I think any reasonable view of the film will reveal to be true. If Steven Spielberg's biggest sin in having made the equally maligned World War II comedy 1941 around the same time as this film was in not realizing until it was too late that slapstick comedy wasn't his forte, then Cimino's sin in making HEAVEN'S GATE the way he did was in not realizing that the Western wasn't really his thing. His visions of making a David Lean/Cecil B. DeMille-type epic right out of the chute obscured the fact that such grandeur wasn't really what the Western genre was about, either historically or cinematically. He didn't have the experience of a John Ford, a Howard Hawks, or a Henry Hathaway in this arena. He also unfortunately seemed to lack the ability to see the things that worked in more recent Western epics like director Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, both towering masterpieces from 1969, and both of which had stories that developed into epics, rather than having been full-born as such from the start. In short, it's likely that Cimino couldn't see the forest for the trees&#x85;at least not through all the smoke and the dust that gets spread around in the film.And yet, somehow, there's a lot to like for any viewer with the patience to sit through the more than three and a half hours of film. The cast, which includes Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif, Joseph Cotten, and Isabelle Hupert, does very solid work, even if they were exposed to doing dozens and dozens of takes under Cimino's uber-perfectionistic direction. The cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond, who had won an Oscar for his work on Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND in 1977, is impressive enough, even if sometimes obscured by the aforementioned smoke and dust, especially in the final (and rather violent) battle sequence. The period score by David Mansfield (who has a cameo role) is also fairly impressive, sometimes echoing the score that Ennio Morricone composed for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; and in utilizing Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube, both in Mansfield's solo guitar version (near the end) and Leonard Bernstein's 1965 New York Philharmonic recording (in the Harvard prologue of the film), Cimino may be tipping his cap to Stanley Kubrick's cagey use of the Strauss waltz in 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY. The end result may be extravagant to an obvious fault, but one can't fault Cimino for not trying hard enough; his problem, ironically, may have been in trying too much.The film's recent re-release in Cimino's first version (lasting just over three and a half hours) in New York theaters, and on DVD, has led its most ardent defenders to claim HEAVEN'S GATE as the masterpiece that nobody recognized back in 1980-81. I don't know that I'd quite call it a masterpiece, for the reasons I've stated. But even with its numerous attendant flaws, HEAVEN'S GATE is also nowhere near the catastrophe its detractors have made it out to be for decades, not by a long shot. It is a film that needs to be seen with an open mind and a patient one too, which a lot of people still seem exceptionally reluctant to do in this age of TITANIC, AVATAR, and other mega-budget opuses that make even the $45 million spent by Cimino on this one film seem exceptionally paltry now.

When first released to New York in November of 1980, it was a 219 epic, notoriously over budget, from self indulgent film autor Michael Cimino who had previously outraged and fascinated with his bloated 183 minute Viet Nam/S&M epic, THE DEER HUNTER.The critics - whether they had praised THE DEER HUNTER or eviscerated it - let Cimino's reputation for self indulgence on both films color their view of the new film and pretty much destroyed it and him.Within a week of the release, it was reported that the film would be withdrawn after the following weekend for re-editing. Dozens of film fans (myself included) rushed to the city to see the ORIGINAL, then thought likely never to be seen again, cut of the film, and were amazed to find a beautiful, even dazzling, take on the history of the American West (using a specific range war as the allegory for the whole) unblinkered by the stereotypes of cowboy films of the past.The film on the big screen was elegant in its lyric storytelling leading to the almost balletic violence of the conclusion. It was not for the short of attention span or the unsophisticated who never outgrew their Lone Ranger or Bonanza TV shows, but it was a FILM that justified the medium. When the final credits rolled for the packed house watching this universally press panned film, it was one of the few times I've been with a movie audience moved to actually applaud the achievement on the screen.Of course the movie WAS withdrawn and edited down to the shorter (more exhibitor friendly) 149 minute form which ironically was everything the original critics SAID the film was. With the bulk of the stately East Coast introduction eliminated, the rationale and underpinnings of the story were severely undercut and the film became not only less coherent, it ironically FELT more interminable than the half hour longer original.To this day I remain convinced that had HEAVEN'S GATE been released FIRST and THE DEER HUNTER second, their commercial fates would also have been reversed and today we'd view HEAVEN'S GATE as the flawed classic and THE (Best Picture Oscar winning) DEER HUNTER as the self indulgent disaster and a monument to a mismanaged studio spinning out of control and destroyed by funding an unstable director beyond the bounds of reason in the pursuit of his vision. It's more than a pity; it's close to an artistic tragedy. The edited version cannot, in good conscience, be recommended despite some stunning cinematography (by Vilmos Zsigmond) and surviving performances (everyone's performances were harmed by the edit, but Kristofferson, Walken and Huppert were never better). If the original release print is offered however, it is a genuine treasure to be savored on a par with and even surpassing such landmarks as von Stroheim's GREED or Griffith's INTOLERANCE.

I read the horrendous reviews and the bad stories of the production overages, an ego gone wild and horses being killed. I ended up seeing the 1981 spring released 149 minute version, which I would not recommend to anyone, well not to any friends. I tried to watch the full version on beta in 1984, but it just didn't cut it on a 25 inch screen. Now, 2005, I feel I have to seize this opportunity to see this film as Michael Cimino intended it to be seen On the Big Screen and decide for myself. San Francisco's beautiful palace of a theater, The Castro presented all 229 mins (intermission included) of Heaven's Gate on a newly restored 35mm print January 31-Feb. 2, 2005. I went in fully armed, prepared to be bored silly and to have my ass so sore I could barely sit through the drive home, I brought a pillow to sit on. To the contrary, the extra seat padding was not necessary as it was when I saw the restored version of 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' a couple years ago in the same theater. Now, the seats are new and mostly comfortable. The organist played wonderfully, some music from the film before the show! The only thing Heaven's Gate was 'missing' is an official visual Overture attached at the beginning of the film like all the sweeping epics of the 50's and 60's'. Heaven's Gate' is an American EPIC love story with a European flavor I'll call 'fairly accurate truth'. I saw this film as a yin/yang that makes up the melting pot America, the Beautiful through an unconventional audio/visual exploration of Love and Hate; Greed and Humanity; violence and peace, Trust and Betrayal of the American Dream, experientially. I was stricken by the awesome wonder of visual poetry before my eyes, that which is lost on the puny TV screen for America the Beautiful is the backdrop; brazenly big and breathtakingly captured by Hungarian born cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond! I was feeling like I was right there as the train pulled into in Casper, Wyoming! For the better or the worse, the young woman behind me was being like Clark Griswald observing the Grand Canyon in National Lampoon's Vacation! There I was buying into the illusion before me while getting caught up in the full ambiance of the scene! People in full costume are milling about as they would at a train station while Jim Averill was being brought up to date by his old Irish friend, the train porter. This is about when I heard the woman behind me say to her boyfriend, 'I understand why this is the worst movie ever made 'cause I can't hear what they're saying.' I thought aloud in a normal speaking voice, 'Be a fly on the wall and take in the scene babe, that's what it's there for.' Then, a few minutes later I hear her complain, 'they're holding the shots way too long.' Again, I thought aloud just above a whisper, 'But, isn't this a great shot of 'America the Beautiful' worth holding for a minute or so, even though it does break cinematic rules.Indeed, 'Heaven's Gate' is the fictitious accounting of the Johnson County Wars of the 1880's when land barons, cattle barons and other marauders in suits were having immigrants killed for stealing a cow or two to feed their families and themselves. Sam Waterston is the All American leader of 'The Association'', a group of even more incredibly ugly members of the Human race on American soil, breathing the same air of freedom as the enemy to their bottom line. These are the hoity-toity 'self-made' men who put greed, power and profit above the 125 names they collectively put on a 'Death List' of immigrants. These American men in the Land of the Free, of course, hire others to do their killing for them. Heaven's Gate is Love Triangle between ALL American Jim Averill, the French Madame Ella Watson and first son of Russian immigrants born in America, Nate Champion who is the Association's hired assassin. I saw each lead character represents an evolution of immigrants. Ella who is European, not long off the boat with accent and all who naively believes in the American Dream. Nate who is first generation immigrant is well on his way to being a corrupted American; a total sell out who collects $50 a head for killing his people; his Russian countrymen. Jim Averill is All American Lawman who stands up for the ideals of 'America', the laws of the land and in the end the Right to life of each immigrant on the Death List.The one element cleverly absent in this film, but still fuels the motivation for the sins against Humanity, is religious rhetoric. However, there is an undercurrent of the puritanical Religious belief system that justifies the American male's maniacal motivations for corruption, hence 'Heaven's Gate'Jim, not realizing until its over, the American Dream is only a 'dream'. And to add salt to the wound, again, sometimes the dreams are best left as dreams.When the closing credits scrolled up the screen, I realized I would love to see this film on the IMAX screen or in 70 mm&#133;with an 'Overture'.

It's certainly not without its flaws. Yes, it's too long, and its pace is very slow. A lot of superfluous scenes could have been cut out, and it's the definition of elliptical filmmaking.Heaven's Gate has been called a huge self-indulgence on the part of Cimino, but for me that didn't come across at all. There is not a single shot in this movie that doesn't have a valid point -- it's just that Cimino didn't have to include all the points that he did. For a movie to be self-indulgent on the part of the director, it usually has to be without complete merit in certain key areas. There's a lot of hanging silence in the movie, a lot of very long shots, and very long scenes. In my opinion, though, all of the long scenes served to convey something that's at least helpful to the understanding of the movie -- usually in terms of characterization. Is that really Cimino's self-indulgence, or is he just trying too hard? It might have been interminable to sit through all 3 hours and 39 minutes to the movie back in 1980, but when I saw it on DVD I felt enough of a pulse to the characters and the plot to keep me interested. It's awash in atmosphere. The dialogue isn't exactly snappy, but it's certainly smartly written. Cimino evokes sympathy through the use of quiet tones between the speakers, and that's not easy to do. The Christopher Walken character goes through a profound and complete change over the course of this movie -- it's a fully developed part.To classify Heaven's Gate as the biggest financial bomb in history is probably accurate; but by no means was this an artistic failure, not by any stretch of the imagination. It's an intelligently made, very deliberate Western. It's not what I'd call a great movie, but it's certainly good, and in many stretches very good. I do wonder how people can blast Heaven's Gate as one of the worst films of all time, yet could give Oscar nominations to The Thin Red Line. Both films use exactly the same template, scope, deliberation and moral imperative. Heaven's Gate just suffered from terrible publicity -- possibly the fault of Cimino's arrogance, or the fault of others who grew impatient with the process. But maybe what Cimino was fighting for wasn't just sprung out of his own ego. 'Cause from the looks of it, he knew the inside and outside of his story, and knew how he had to tell it.Heaven's Gate is a GOOD movie. It's not a classic, but it's certainly nowhere close to an embarrassment. It might be the biggest bomb of all time if you're talking the ledger balance. But its horrible legend and near-unanimous bashing at the time of its release also gives it one more superlative It's one of the most underrated films of all time.

The film is based on the Johnson County Cattle War's. This film is a contradiction. It has beautiful shots and cinematography in some scenes, and look like a home video in other, possibly due to the deterioration of the film. It has a majestic story and good acting, but lacks development in scenes. It builds to a grand finale when the town folks are winning, and ends in a disappointment. The length of the film is also daunting, a neat 220 minutes /. Now for the positives. The story is original and reflects the mood of the 70's new Hollywood. Christopher Walken gives an underrated performance and highlighted a great supporting cast along with John hurt, Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterson. Cinematography and key scenes such as the Harvard graduation and the roller rink highlight this film memorability.

It is inaccurate in regards to all the historic characters it uses, it is inaccurate about who the small landowners were, it is even inaccurate about many of the most important details of the Johnson County War. And it doesn't matter. Should people want to watch it as a history lesson then it serves as a signpost. It IS a history lesson about the realities of late 19th century Wilder West, meanwhile, and so much so, and in so much detail, that it is in my eyes the best, the only true Western I have ever seen.

When it first came out, this film was lambasted by almost everyone as way too long and boring as dirt. Having watched it twice now I feel that it has been the recipient of too many unfair assessments. Westerns are iconic to American movies and culture. Many American myths are manufactured and admired in the schemes of Westerns. What Camino found attractive in the Johnson County wars is a bit of a mystery in itself. An event best known to historians of the old West, Camino felt it needed a movie to honor the drama. OK, that's a bit odd but he did it anyway.Much like The Deer Hunter, Camino's film is a bit too long and certainly self absorbed. That being said, the plot is not hard to follow, the characters pretty standard bad guys, villains, victims, with two strong characters fighting over the same love interest. Pretty much the same western plots and subplots seen in countless movies. What makes this film work for me and motivates me to give it a high rating are its redeeming features. The visual images are simply so gorgeous that we are entertained visually throughout the film. The obsessive attention to details shows through very well and after all these years the visual recreation of those times is recreated in all its glory. This is a film that you have to be willing to view like it was a long opera; you simply cannot be impatient and expect a quick formulaic western to ride you off into the sunset. That would have been easy to accomplish and Camino opts for a larger scale dynamic. Sure, many scenes take up too much footage, that is a weakness in my view. But, what we see is very entertaining.The actors, not quite in their prime, all young and vibrant, give terrific performances. Especially outstanding are Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Waterston, Bridges and Huppert. I know, that's almost the whole cast, but they were really great to watch. This is a drama for adults and if given half the chance to tell a story on a canvas as big as Wyoming.....works for me. I like long films that are highly dramatic for example, Barry Lyndon, The Deer Hunter, Citizen Kane are examples of very good films that are also very long. I have come to the conclusion that Camino's vision was worth the effort to create. A very fine western that has rarely been eclipsed for beauty and attention to historical detail.

At first some scenes may feel over-long but later, the long scenes settle into a rhythm; the points of the film are made by letting some scenes continue for as long as they would in reality. The scenes of nudity, sex and cruelty are precise without being self-indulgent; at no time is the viewer made to feel revulsion at the style of the portrayal even when the material is shocking. Criticisms about the use of sepia, the smokiness/dustiness of some scenes and the fuzzy dialogue are made by those who need every t crossed and i dotted. One doesn't need to hear every word to understand who is who and where the plot is going. I thought it one of the most beautiful films I have seen and would happily have watched a further two or three hours of the same; I hope someone in the industry will have the intelligence to release it on DVD.Updated - and now it is on DVD and I am able to watch it whenever I like. Having just done so once more, I repeat - some scenes are so beautifully lit and photographed they are a joy just to look at - never mind what's going on - like fine paintings. This film, in my view, shows ordinary people enjoying simple entertainments like roller-skating and dancing - as a relief from their hard-working daily lives and it shows - what we all know to be true - that those who already have more than they need and who have never been taught to enjoy simple, joyful pleasures, are, as ever, determined to deprive those who have little enough of the little they do have. It would be a greater service to the film industry and those film goers who look- mostly in vain - for excellence in film, if critics, instead of constantly bleating on about how this film nearly bankrupted the studio, encouraged, instead, more studios to make more films of this fine calibre. The relevance of this film to modern life is extraordinary. As the rules that protect the profits of the music and film industries are dusted off and sharpened, we see once again the greedy determination of the rich that ordinary people should never, ever, enjoy themselves at the expense of the bottom line.

I was astounded that an American studio could produce such a European film with it's slow pace and its unfocused plot. The lack of any strong characters felt like a flaw but I raged at the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht which seemed as though it was bolted on to give some kind of plot cohesion and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the picture.It was also refreshing to see a western which made no pretence about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate detritus of the American Dream.The western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which prefigured the recent Deadwood series.The film was massively cut for the American audience and its my very real wish that in these days of Director's Cuts that Michael Cimino is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection - a cut which could turn this ill fated movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become. I have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes so much more sense,although Christopher Walken is responsible mainly for carrying this off. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson had Played the main lead!There was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. Nevertheless, the camera work was so cleverly handled that at times you could almost believe you were inside the action yourself.And there were many special moments. Everybody arguing in the hall in different languages trying to overcome their national differences and seek some unity of action in face of the impending disaster gave a real insight into the difficulties facing the welding together of the USA especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money.Nate's faltering approach to Ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another one. I had a special showing with a large group of mates to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it whilst having varying reservations.This revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for Americans to take when the film was first released but we all felt it had enormous merit and that its place in cinema history was also due for major revision "},{"Title":"Forget the Box Office, This Film is Bad","Date":"28 April 2012","Score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":" Heaven's Gate (1980) * (out of 4) Michael Cimino's notorious HEAVEN'S GATE will always be remembered for going so far over-budget and making so little at the box office. However, with that said, I'm never one to judge a film solely by the box office because many times great movies do poorly there while real trash makes millions. The basic story here takes place during the 1890s cattle wars in Wyoming as immigrants are forced off their land by rich businessmen who have hired a bunch of goons to kill off people named in a death book. Kris Kirstofferson and Christopher Walken play men on opposite sides of the fence but both are connected by the love for the same woman (Isabeele Huppert).Whenever people mention HEAVEN'S GATE it's always because of his disastrous box office results, which had the studio cutting the film down a week into its release. After viewing the 227-minute version I can't help but think that perhaps the studio did the best thing and I do wonder how much better the shorter cut is. I say that because this film is so deadly dull and boring from the word go that you can't help but think that cutting out over an hour would have to have helped. I mean, I can think of countless scenes that could have been chopped off and it wouldn't have effected the story any and that's the biggest problem. The fact that a nearly four-hour movie has no story is something that is just mind boggling. I'm really at a loss of words as to why Cimino thought that no story was a smart idea and this is what really kills everything.So many scenes just go on and on and on and yet they never really connect to one another. It really does feel as if the director was just filming stuff for the sake of wanting a long movie and he didn't care if it added up in the end. The entire prologue is a complete waste and could have been cut off. There's a long sequence with a violin player on skates that could have been axed. There's a follow up to this scene where Kristofferson and Huppert dance. Every single scene in this movie just goes on for no reason because the extended running time doesn't give anything to the story. Even scenes that are nothing but dialogue go into directions that add nothing to the story and when they're over you realize that more often than not they didn't have anything to do with stuff that preceded it. What's even stranger is the entire film is so ugly to look at that you can't help but wonder why the beautiful locations would be wasted by what appears to be dust and dirt over the print. This brownish tone (which comes and goes) just looks downright ugly and does nothing for the picture.It is rather shocking that the man who made THE DEER HUNTER would get an unlimited budget and an all-star cast yet turn out something this bad. It's strange but without its reputation of being a box office bomb there's really no other reason to watch this. There are countless bad movies out there that have been forgotten over time but this here will live on because of the money lost. I guess that's a bad thing because so many people are going to be intrigued by this and have the misfortune to sit through it.

Heaven's Gate was a film I really wanted to like, with a cast like Kris Krisstoferson, Christopher Walken, Jeff Bridges and John Hurt, how could it fail? What was sad was that it did, and on quite a massive level too.The cinematography does give the film an epic, sweeping grandeur that was more than fitting with the film, and the scenery was gorgeous. The score is well composed and fitting, and of the cast the best performances for me came from Christopher Walken and Jeff Bridges. Kris Krisstoferson was good, but I wasn't entirely gripped by his character.Sadly, nothing else worked. I feel really bad, this did seem somewhat interesting and I so wanted to say this is very underrated. But I can't. Some people may say it's too long, maybe so as there were a lot of scenes that could have been either excised or shortened, I actually found the pace and story much more problematic.Just to say, I don't mind slow-paced movies. Some slow-paced movies like The Godfather and 2001 A Space Odyssey are masterpieces. That said, not only was Heaven's Gate really slow and dull with some scenes having no sense of pulse at all, but the story is a mess with conflicts poorly brought in and resolved and even about eighty minutes or so in the plot is still incomprehensible.That's not all. The cast are great on paper, but in the end only about three of the actors are good. They are not given justice by their characters, some of which come and go with no explanation at all. John Hurt fares worse with this, he is such a great actor but he is given next to nothing to do. Sorry but to me being an admirer of this man's acting skills and work I find that criminal. The writing is another big problem, a lot of it is inane and feels really stilted.All in all, even with the cast and scenery as great as they are, Heaven's Gate still managed to be an incomprehensible mess. If there is any consolation, I think there are far worse movies out there. 3/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"This is one of the finest movies ever made.","Date":"1 January 2010","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western","Review":" It is interesting to look at the rating distribution for this movie, and to read a few of the many reviews. The proportion of 10 ratings is unusually high considering an overall average rating of 6.4. Without reading the reviews, this would suggest that it either evokes extremely positive or extremely negative impressions. I am of the former. I consider the film brilliant in all ways.Starting with the performances. Kristofferson is outstanding as a man raised in a world of the privileged, who leaves Harvard upon graduation to focus his youthful idealism through law enforcement, helping immigrants who have come to the U.S. looking for a better life. He is doomed to return to his roots and wealth, but only as an empty shell of man whose life ends with the death of his true love in Wyoming. I have seen Kristofferson in several other movies, with this being the only one suggesting acting ability why this ability surfaced in this movie, never to be seen again, is an interesting mystery - anyone have an answer? John Hurt is magnificent as the oratorically gifted intellectual whose inclination for self-indulgence wins out over his awareness and conscience of the injustice around him. We've all met someone like Hurt's character in this movie, and been both saddened and disgusted at the wasted potential.Christopher Walken is excellent in a complex role that stirs feelings of revulsion, sympathy, and admiration. A hitman for the cattleman's association who develops concern for the immigrants, perhaps because of his desire for Ella.Sam Waterston does well as the dispassionate head of the cattleman's association. It's clear that his power comes from wealth and not from strength of character, yet he is unyielding in defending his position, even when confronted with the potential of mortal harm.Isabelle Huppert is perfect as the Ella, a madame who runs the bordello that serves the community. The love triangle between her, Kristofferson, and Walken is sophisticated and open to changing viewer opinions throughout the course of the movie.Jeff Bridges shows his acting prowess, at this early stage in his career, as the apparent mayor and manager of the immigrant community general store.Richard Masur produced his all time best performance for this movie as the Irish conductor whose sympathy for the immigrants is his eventual undoing.In going through this list of performances, I am reminded at just how rich is the character development in this movie. In watching this you get the sense of knowing these people and developing strong feelings for each.The settings of this movie are diverse and detailed. The opening graduation day at Harvard, the immigrant roller rink, the dusty town of Casper, the final battle between the cattlemen and immigrants, beautiful in its simplicity, and the return to lifestyles of the rich and famous, all create indelible memories. They also provide the dramatic contrast and turning points for the movie idealism-to-realism-to-emptiness.I think the basis for the hypercritical reviews of this movie, at the time of its release, could be used for teaching a course on the influence of the media in shaping public perception. If you haven't seen this, I strongly recommend giving it a try.

Beginning of the 80's was a period when movie making turned to what it is today, a pure business, and no art. Accountants always ran the studios, and what is worse decided on what should be filmed and how, but up until the 80's, artists and talented filmmakers could find space to work freely and produce beautiful classics. Cimino made Heaven's Gate trying to do what Orson Welles did in 1941 making Citizen Kane, with Kubrick-like perfection in mind and with his education in painting, he made beautiful movie but was ultimately stopped in his tracks and never allowed to put his vision on the screen, the way he imagined it. The 219 minute version that came out in 1980, before it was severely cut up, and again in 2004, was a taste of what this movie could be if it was made like Cimino wanted it to.First of all this film is one of the most beautifully shot movies ever. The scenes are fantastic and they look like Claude Monet paintings most of the time (best example Kristofferson and Huppert's picnic by the river, and scene of the clouds passing over). Cimino waited a whole day on the set to capture beautiful moments like that, forgetting to eat or drink,like a painter in a daze, or sculptor engulfed in making a sculpture that epitomizes his dream. Story is well paced, and all the complaints of scenes being overlong or some of them surplus, are totally out of place. Look at the Deer Hunter everybody still raves about, the wedding scene at the beginning, takes up the third of the film, the whole movie consists of five overlong scenes, and nobody complained about that. Cimino wanted this movie to be his Citizen Kane, and he said that he wanted it to be realistic in it's portrayal of the times to the best of his knowledge, which is often neglected by filmmakers in order to scrap up the movie for the least amount of money in shortest time possible, just to keep the assembly line going, and that usually destroys the whole concept of the film. The trouble is that the accountants didn't care if it's close to being perfect. They just wanted something to move over the counter, and fast. Character development and plausibility of some scenes may be in question, but the movie was cut short to start with, and if you start looking for totally plausible Hollywood film, you won't get far. Sometimes it's also known as an artistic freedom.What's most important is that this movie never had a chance, it was misconceived, criticized and bad mouthed long before it was even completed and hundred times repeated lie becomes the truth. So this movie was never judged on it's own merit, as UA executive Steven Bach has told in Final Cut, the making of Heaven's Gate, and the unmaking of a studio. People went to see it, knowing that it's bad, long before they even saw it, so a lot of them, when asked about the film, repeated what they red in movie reviews, and the long scenes complaint is the best example, it sounds like the scene from Amadeus, where Emperor Joseph II, criticizes Mozart's opera because it has too many notes. The premature criticism of the film probably has a lot to do with the story of the movie, it portrays a bloody picture of the birth of a nation, and everybody still wanted to believe in John Ford's and King Vidor's westerns. I hope that this movie will find it's rightful place in the years to come. It deserves to be acclaimed at least as much as Paul Thomas Anderson's There will be blood. It may or may not have destroyed the United Artists, but it destroyed THE artist for sure.

One can only imagine the outcry from an accurate portrayal of any one of the myriad human caused disasters of the American Indian Wars; they would make the outcry about Heaven's Gate look like a Sixthieth Anniversary celebration. Hollywood is not up to examining American history closely. Their school system with it's community based school boards will not let any of this real history live; they must sugarcoat every thing so the past ends up looking like some ridiculous Disney cartoon. The historical equivalent of squirrels talking to dinosaurs, as is part of their silly offerings as is happening now.No-I don't think the movie was too long. I sat mesmerized by the absolute authenticity of the sets and the costumes and the scenes honestly full of people and not just clever camera work showing the same people over and over again. How many movies are produced that require such attention from the viewer? Other commentators have criticised the film for failing to give depth to the characters and others for giving too much depth in the visuals particularly. In my view, the movie was about events and the people took second place to these monumental events; I was quite happy with this-I didn't care if the immigrants were not fleshed in-I felt the movie was not about them.Hollywood has shot itself in the foot by taking movies away from directors-they are the masters of film.
