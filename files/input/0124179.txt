While it certainly has a lot to say about sex, and especially sexual fidelity, the point of the film is not that at all, but that concerns of sex are not truly the most important factors in a relationship.  While loyalty and honesty certainly are, forgiveness is still a virtue, and lying about sex is not the same as lying about feelings.  Though I, of course, do not agree with what the female characters in this movie did, at least the movie makes the oft-overlooked point that sex isn't everything, a point seldom made in movies, and often made in life.  Though it is certainly not an exceptional movie, it is worth seeing, and an interesting look into the privileged status sex has attained in our modern society.

It's the funniest of the year, an actor's nightmare (how far do you go when you can do whatever you want?), but also the quintessential Downey, Jr. persona.Heather Graham is my baby, she just doesn't know it yet.  Just kidding--truth be told, she excels in the part of one of Downey Jr.'s girlfriends.  Wagner nearly matches her in the role of the other.Toback's direction is stagey (what else can you do with one set?), but his writing is on fire.  Sometimes, you snag bits of the actor's riffs and laugh at what you can get your hands on.  At other times, you sit back and let it flow over you--this is high-speed Jack Kerouac, coupled with Whit Stillman's keen ear for American bourgeois speech patterns.  Wagner and Graham test each other on Downey Jr.'s lovemaking speeches, tying a noose for him before he even arrives, later Downey Jr. verbally abuses and repairs himself in his bathroom mirror--highlights of a dynamite script.1998 was the year for actors and actresses, and many notables (and a few unknowns) did landmark work  Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, Jane Horrocks in Little Voice, Warren Beatty in Bulworth, John Travolta and Kathy Bates in Primary Colors, Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful, Bill Pullman in Zero Effect, and Robert Downey Jr. in this one.

The start of the movie sees two women (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet each other while waiting for their boyfriends to get home from their holidays. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a lovely looking actress, and she plays Louise; a cute girl whose beloved boyfriend is an all round entertainer; music, movies you name it, he does it. While she's telling the other girl, Carla (Heather Graham) all about her wonderful boyfriend, it soon becomes apparent that the similarities between their two male friends are too much.... and it's obvious that the two girls are dating the same guy. Oh Dear. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, the sleaze-bag that has two girlfriends while some poor guy somewhere has to go without one. Downey plays the sort of guy that the ladies like, but men find repulsively annoying; he is, basically, a mummy's boy. The worst kind too; on the phone ringing mother all the time, continually showering his girlfriends with ambitious (albeit empty) promises etc. It's enough to make a normal guy sick.The film knowingly rips off superior three-way love triangle films such as Jules et Jim. This film doesn't work though; mostly due to the fact that it's story is so unbelievable. Seriously, if two women had just found that they were dating the same guy...they wouldn't stick around to talk about it. Another reason why it falls down is that it's just so turgid. There's no end of possibilities for the outcome of the situation that this movie presents, especially with the claustrophobia of setting it all in a small apartment; but all the movie does is get lost in masses of dialogue; badly written and poorly delivered dialogue, that is. The film is also massively overacted; it just isn't believable that people would act like they do in this film after finding themselves in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things that is wasted in the film. With Natural Born Killers, he proved that he could give brilliantly entertaining performances, and that is something that this movie could do with. The two females aren't wasted because nobody expected anything from them anyway, but Downey could definitely have been better utilised. Overall? A waste of time. Don't bother, see Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. That's my advice.

With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is diminished still by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr proves as usual what a gifted actor he is, he shadows the two actresses in their scenes together which is constantly noticeable. The pointless yet intense sex scene seems merely to exist in order to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive giving the actors a much deserved break from talking.

It doesn't sound like anything people would say. It's not structured like anything people would say. The motivations and behavior assigned to Carla and Lou by this script are as realistic and believable as the special effects in Plan 9 From Outer Space.Let me give you one example of what I mean and I'll only give you one for fear that remembering more of Two Girls and a Guy would send me into a self-induced coma of disgust and ennui. When Blake returns home, Lou and Carla initially hide. Then Carla emerges and slowly works up to an argument with Blake where she gets him to profess his unshakable fidelity to her. That's when Lou emerges from the closet to expose his romantic perfidy. But what woman is going to sit in the closet for the better part of 10 minutes while her boyfriend's other girlfriend talks to him? It's not Carla and Lou planned to trap Blake somehow. Lou just sat in the darkness for no reason until the Almighty Plot Hammer knocked her into the light. What kind of person could both control her own emotions and trust a near total stranger enough to let the situation unfold like that? And that scene is not the most contrived one in the script.Somehow, RDJ is able to take this dialog that even George Lucas would choke on and make it not only fun to listen to but sound like something which could come out of the mouth of a living homo sapien. How does he do it? I don't know. That's what makes him so great and should make all of us so thankful he didn't wind up dead in some alley from a drug overdose. But even RDJ can't salvage things when he has to interact with his less gifted castmates and their vain attempts to do something with this garbage writing.Do you want to know how bad Two Girls and a Guy really is? If, at some point in this movie, Graham and Wagner had gotten buck naked and engaged in a 5 minute long lesbian sex scene, I still wouldn't recommend watching it. Not even to fast forward to that scene. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.

With three main actors playing, it's a minimal cast. The plot is as simple as can be Two girls find out that they both have the same boyfriend, they hide in his apartment and then confront him one at a time. Like in a play, events are told through conversations and arguments that the three of them share. There's fierce accusations, faked suicides, lots of singing from Blake and a very graphic and hot sex scene between himself and Carla, while Lou listens. The possibility of a threesome is discussed but not accepted. Blake confesses that, since he's been juggling with the two of them, he's had a good handful of meaningless flings on the side, and Carla and Lou also reveal that they have had numerous affairs, something that takes Blake completely by surprise. Throughout the film, Blake calls his mother constantly, worried about her health and trying to distract himself from other things.The last scene, I'll admit, is the best. Robert Downey Jr displays a tremendous talent in putting all of his emotions and strength in his performance. His ability to act and communicate so well earns him a reputation of being a brilliant and underrated portrayer.If this were to be live, it would work out just fine, and of course, seeing live actors right in front of you on a screen is better in some cases. "},{"Title":"best seen as the Robert Downey Jr show, and a good acidic relationship drama","Date":"4 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Two Guys and a Girl is a stage play put on film, but what sets it apart are what make any play interesting some staggering scenes of drama and conflict (or even humor) and the performances. The film is ostensibly about two girls (Wagner and Graham), both dating the duplicitous actor Blake (Downey Jr) and how by chance they see each other on the steps of his building waiting for him, figure out who the other is to him, and then ambush him with the big question Why the lies? This becomes the main crux of what Toback is after, which is an investigation of lies in an actor and the sexual truths in a man who seems to be obsessed with his (supposedly) sick mother, and even reverts into performing Hamlet, oddly enough, rather than face up to the big questions at hand.Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage deep? Not entirely, and as a director of actors with such a low-budget AND ambition he takes a few minutes getting things feeling right (maybe this is due in some small part to Wagner not being the strongest actor, at least compared to the other two around her - or maybe just the one really) with the weirdly fast dialog. But when Downey steps into the room the film takes on a whole other air. There's complaints to be had about the film, such as a script that only usually, not always, takes very seriously what a confrontation-mega-argument like this would really turn into (albeit, and I must say it, the ill-rated NC-17 sex scene is about as hot as anything in late 90s cinema). And a couple of scenes contain, again, some clunky dialog that maybe needed a polish over - keep in mind this is a script Toback wrote in a little over a week, and maybe didn't know at first if it would be film or theater bound.And yet, with the complaints to be had, there's Robert Downey Jr. Toback wrote the film for him and it's hard not to see him fulfill the character every single moment on screen. Maybe it's a little easy to see an actor like Downey playing a full-of-himself actor/whatever who dances around relationships with women and commitment since Blake is a character who can't even trust himself let alone others. You don't want to take your eyes off this guy for a second, and that's the genius of Downey Jr whenever he's in material that calls his attention. If nothing else, Two Girls and a Guy becomes an actor-movie must-see for the scene right after he's punked his girlfriends by pretending suicide, face half blood splattered, and has a talk at himself in the mirror. It's a moment of madness that could give Travis Bickle an eyebrow raise.And that ending - one of those rare twists that somehow makes the rest of the film look in a different light. It also provides one more scene of amazing acting from one of America's best.

Much of the writing was trite and obvious- his favorite song is Nobody Knows Me and Wagner responds, No wonder that's his favorite song! and the set decoration (e.g. the poster of Jules et Jim on the wall) was a silly allusion to a masterpiece with which shares little else beside the genre.The acting ran the gamut from Downey's tour-de-force performance to Graham's complex portrayal of an intelligent modern woman who shields her heart yet allows us to see glimpses of that pain, while Wagner's was a horror show of one dimensional acting which made me want to leave after the first fifteen minutes. To be fair, Wagner did get a little better once Downey came on the scene, but never rose to the level of her peers and petered out well before the end. Downey and Graham plowed full steam ahead, giving us great performances. Downey still overshadowed Graham, but this seemed to be a result more from the script than lack of her acting ability, and I look forward to seeing her in another project. And hopefully Downey can resolve his personal problems, because we would love to watch his performances for a long time to come.Overall 2/4 stars  "}{"Title":"is this the same movie?","Date":"16 May 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" At my local video rental store, they have a special place for Two Girls and a Guy.

Towards the end, one girls says she had sex with 4 other men while with Blake and the other says she had sex with 3 girls, and just about right after that the bisexual says she's leaving and the other proposes to Blake that why not allow each other to screw around and never repress sexual desires.

I didn't know what was wrong with how they were at the end, I guess personally I just didn't see human sense to it.

An almost real-time movie, full of long shots, made it critically interesting but the seemingly unrehearsed banter and inexplicable continuation of the plot is unconvincing.  Downey Jr. does a fairly good job, when given the chance. Graham is gorgeous, as always, but does not give much to the movie.  The NC-17 rating is surprising due to the existence of only one steamy scene with no nudity.  As to the genre, comedy it may attempt to be but it is nothing but drama.  Laughing at it was near impossible and the ending left me surprised.  It ended abruptly and without conclusion.  Overall, a pretty bad movie though I am pleased at their attempting to do it.

I can say that this is not just a film about the man and his lifestyle of portraying himself as what he wants people to see him as in order to get what he wants (or needs, for that matter). Rather, I believe it is a study of how WE ALL live our lives in this way. After all, it turns out that the two women are not who and what Blake believes them to be. NOTE The symbolism of the mirrors -- the manner in which they are positioned. ie., when he is talking to himself, there are several of him; during the sex scene, the mirror that they bump is turned away from them; and when the women confess in the tub, he turns away from them only to see himself (through his hands) in the mirror, and so on.

I like movies such as Die Hard and The Fast And The Furious, but it seems like with those types of movies the filmmakers are always trying too hard to entertain the audience with one-liners and cool stunts.  While watching Two Girls And A Guy, I was not distracted from the story ONCE because of something that felt out of place.(SPOILERS in the next paragraph) I also love the lack of political correctness in this movie.  For instance, feminists might complain that the two women should never think about staying in a relationship with this guy.  However, I think it is more realistic to think they would.  Women who are the age of Lou and Carla are usually looking for one man to spend the rest of their life with.  It is much more difficult to do that if you have to start over in the dating process.  Most people would try to make the relationship work, even if the other person had cheated on them.  Political correctness might dictate that the filmmakers show the women as strong females who would not settle for such a man, but it is much more realistic the way the movie is presented.I caught the rated-R version of this movie on cable and have not seen the NC-17 version, nor have I seen the movie in its original aspect ratio of 1.851 since most of the movie channels still aren't broadcasting in widescreen.

Regardless of how bare your soul is, many people, perhaps even MOST people, will not understand.

It was meant to happen.I am in my mid 30's and have seen a lot of films, and have always been fascinated with both the mainstream and the not-so-mainstream films. I agree with the possibility that this may be so intense because it may very well be simply a portrayal of Robert Downey Jr.'s real life. He has an interesting life. See?There are a lot of intertwined dynamics happening here. At the beginning Lou is excited about having a boyfriend (we find out why she is excited later) and Carla doesn't really want to call Blake her boyfriend, until she has to. Interesting because ***STOP - SPOILER*** Lou ends up running out but Carla remains true. This movie has a central question. If you love someone, can't you forgive them for anything? Even lying? Some people can't. Some people can. If you can, then you are in Carla's world. If you can't, you are with Lou. I think this makes it a deep movie. Since this was filmed in '96-97 when lesbianism was in vogue in the techno club scene (ask me how I know) it was OK for Lou to go both ways. Some people will be shocked. Some people won't.Some people will scoff at this film for 2 minutes and move on, feeling un-entertained. Understandable if you can't identify with the generation, the scene, the situation or the characters (that's actually a lot, a whole lot; I think it will be difficult for the majority of the population to truly identify). I can identify with it all. What DO you do if you meet two people that both really seem special, even to the point of love? Some people think it impossible. Some people don't.

Why did Robert Downey Jr. lie to the two girls? Here's my take on it. SPOILERS AHEAD. Not because he couldn't 'bag' (if you're offended by that word you shouldn't go anywhere near a Toback movie) both of them without lying after all, neither of the girls are married to him, and he could've openly had two or three semi-serious girlfriends and a whole truckload of groupies as a bachelor and up-and-coming actor (as many young studs in the 'business' are known to have); he lied because he wanted two serious relationships at the same time, two real girlfriends at the same time, almost like bigamy; he didn't lie to get the girls to physically put-out, he lied to get them to spiritually commit a part of themselves that they otherwise wouldn't. So when he says that he loved both of them equally (or almost equally), he pretty much means it; and when he had said to each girl that other girls now disgust him, he really meant that too, in the spiritual sense that is. He may have had a few mainly physical encounters but spiritually and romantically he's basically tied to these two women, one of whom will eventually have to go because of time constraints or a slightly higher level of incompatibility. The same would obviously apply if a girl had willingly put herself in this rather flattering dilemma (as the poster for Truffaut's `Jules et Jim' on the wall constantly implies, a film in which there was no deception but which ended tragically because Jeanne Moreau refused to give up her irrational desire to be loved by more than one man until she turned off both of them).What I think Toback is trying to do is show people ways of communicating they haven't considered or have been programmed to overlook. He's trying to say that this situation doesn't have to end up negatively or in some kind of overblown melodrama, though it's definitely prime material for farce. Every attempt at taking it to that cliche area of hurt and shattered and devastated feelings, and overblown psychotic role playing imposed by half-baked and prejudiced societal rules is shown to be not only ridiculous but transcendable by only a little strength and street-or-book-or-other-wise perspective. Of course, the Natasha Gregson Wagner character is the one that shows the most strength because she gets the short end and refuses to stoop to fighting for her man with Heather Graham; not only that, she doesn't even break relations with Graham and asks her to call her. . In 99 out of a hundered other films as soon as Graham and Downey start getting it on in that other room, Gregson Wagner would've broken a whole bunch of Downey's bric-a-brac-furniture, stormed out the apartment cursing and slammed the door, or, barged in on them and had a tantrum wanting to kill both of them. But is that kind of impulsive over-reaction all human beings are capable of? No, and Toback shows that 'it's just friggin sex' it's not the end of the world and it can be dealt with intelligently and calmly, not through some ridiculous tantrum. Toback is a guy who came up in the sixties and was mentioned by Football-Hall-of-Famer Jim Brown in the book `Out of Bounds' as one of the frequent guests at the pre-planned and carefully orchestrated open orgies he used to host at his Hollywood Hills home back in the wild days when the parties wouldn't end. If his widely publicised reputation is correct then he's definitely not new to womanizing, promiscuity and weird relationship scenes, and, apparently he's learned some hard lessons from his experiences and is trying to impart some of them in this film. But what he's laying down here in this film for the so-called 'repressed-propogandized-and-politicized-fear-of-death-thru-AIDS '90s' isn't anything new but basically what many widely read books of the late '60s and early '70s dealt with, books like `Pairing,' `Open Marriage,' etc. They dealt with the fact that sexual desires don't go away but are willingly not acted upon because the time spent pursuing them could be better spent in the main relationship. If they're acted upon physically, that's where it usually ends and the level of intimacy doesn't seem to be worth it compared to the main relationship, therefore further reinforcing the main bond. Also, if there's no strong relationship to hold a man and a woman together, traditional restraints will make cheating more attractive, not less. And even if there is a strong relationship, traditional restraints will definitely work to weaken it by not offering free access to curiosity and making the grass seem greener on the other side than it is, not offer any kind of ridiculous 'insurance' against cheating. The problem, of course, is always TIME, all serious relationships must in the end end up pretty much monogamous (in spirit if not exactly 100% in physical fact) because there is simply too much time and energy required to carry on even as little as two serious love affairs on a high level.. That's the whole argument of the classic book `Open Marriage' which is sneered at by many a pseudo-intellectual '90s 'New-Age Hick' but still as thoroughly relevant today as it ever was, and which amounts to a license to cheat only for people who do not have a serious enough relationship to begin with. Because it's an 'individually tailored' one-to-one thing if it happens to be working on a compatible level no other relationship could duplicate the uniqueness of what you have with that person and it would simply take too much TIME to build the same level of relationship with someone else, time which would be much more rewardingly spent on the relationship you already have. And if you look at all the 'traditional marriage' people who sneer at that, the statistics speak for themselves for every relatively good relationship you'll most probably find 10 dead or happy-to-be-mediocre lukewarm ones maintained for the sake of appearances that can be seen through in two seconds, 10 more that have gone beyond the stultifying effects of a 'closed relationship' to cheating and deception to find some 'happiness-fix' on the side, or, most abundantly, divorce. In Toback's film, Downey's deception leaves Natasha Gregson Wagner out in the cold but she's strong enough to not give too much of a damn about someone like Downey whose lying has put her in a position to get hurt because she happens to be a tad less interesting to him than Heather Graham who has just reclaimed him by giving him sex; she's strong enough to not show her hurt for his satisfaction or to stoop to wanting to fight for a weasel him with Graham. She stays above it, talks things over a while, wishes them the best and moves on. Not realistic? If we're talking in general terms absolutely not; but in individual terms, absolutely yes. There are 4 or 5 people out of a hundred maybe strong enough to pull a Natasha Gregson Wagner exit. And the value of Toback's film is that it chooses to show that rather than the 95 ways how it ought to end in total disaster. As good an actor as he is, Robert Downy Jr. (much like the great Kevin Friggin Spacey) can get incredibly annoying, especially when he's basically playing versions of his obnoxious real-life self he just never seems to be able to calm down for even two seconds without some other arrogant wise-crack spurting out of his mouth again in the next instant. This is pretty much his real personality as evidenced in some of the documentary work he did interviewing people at the Democratic convention a while back (where he made a fool of himself). He's perfect for this role, of course, but I often find him so grating that I can't help wondering what a more controlled master actor like like Sean Penn or a 'cool' actor like Matt Dillon would've done with this role (Dillon's 'coolness' may have gotten in the way, but Penn has played many characters like this before). They may or may not have been better I don't know. Downey's perfect because he's just the kind of weasel that shouldn't be fussed over too much, or god forbid, fought over as he'd no doubt like Natasha Gregson Wagner to do. But, overall, the hilarity outweighs the nausea factor enough for me to stay interested. Heather Graham is also perfect for her role because she's not only a talented actress but has a uniquely 'angelic' character, a girl who at her angriest, cursing ten miles a minute, still seems nice and sweet and not all that b---chy. She can also do a sex scene that's a shot or two away from being X-rated, in which Downey Jr. tries to give 'addicted to crack' a new meaning (in the NC-17 version out on this video that wasn't shown in the theatres), and then come out looking like an untouched, virgin schoolgirl, again owing to her Botticelli-angel-like look (the great French-American actress Julie Delpy from `Before Sunrise' `Passion of Beatrice' and `Killing Zoe' also has that look, but less raw sex-appeal). Graham's 'angelic' look totally creates the erotic tension and shock Toback is looking to induce when things get a bit hardcore because you certainly don't expect her to be quite as wild as she suddenly shows herself to be, especially with Gregson Wagner being in the other room. Her very unique, almost one-of-a-kind look and temperament puts her in very interesting contrast to Natasha Gregson Wagner whose anger is more directly cutting, familiar and menacing but the sting of which is taken out a bit by the fact that she's so cute and petite and all that, like a little cartoon-minx version of mom Natalie Wood (and how much better does Toback use her talents in this film than Larry Clark did in that pretentious, awful, mess `Trouble in Paradise'!). I liked the fact that Toback lets the characters get right into flawless recitations of the lines, Greek-tragedy-Shakespeare-like without any method acting nonsense of intentional mistakes and mumbling Brando-pauses thrown in to add 'real-life' realism and naturalism and all that. He doesn't mind being pseudo-transcendent and bogus-mythic as long as it saves him from the dead-end of naturalism. He gets right down to the point in as clear a way as possible, and who says people can't be this articulate at-the-drop-of-a-hat in 'real life?' Why the hell not?! There are some articulate people around who don't talk like Pesci and DeNiro and Brando in 'real-life' (or any other 'life' on the world's stage, for that matter), you know! But the drawback here, is also precisely this theatricality which gets a little too heavy handed and is not as light-touched and subtle and cinematic as it needs to be to achieve greatness (as in the amazing 'invisible total cinema' films of Eric Rohmer who also puts in tremendous amounts of dialogue in articulate mouths). So what's my two cent verdict, Jack and Jill? Here goes `Two girls and a guy' is definitely not a great film because it tries a little too hard to be provocative and titillating and shocking, but a quite valuable one nevertheless because it breaks cliches at every turn in the dialogue, tries to promote intelligent ways as opposed to culturally pre-programmed ones of dealing with painful dilemmas, provides two very dreamy contrasting girls for guys to lust after and aspire to be worthy of in a slightly more gallant fashion than they are subjected to in the film, and creates the perfect setting for Robert Downey Jr. to be as hilarious (and also, to the sure annoyance of many like myself, as super-obnoxious) as he can. "},{"Title":"It's a pleasure watching Robert Downey Jr. but it doesn't save this film.","Date":"6 February 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  If you are absolutely in love with Robert Downey Jr., this little slice of life will probably be your cup of tea. Don't expect a great story nor should you expect a great script but Downey does make it interesting in spots. It should have been a stage production. For the most part, takes place totally in a small apartment. Two girls wind up there thinking they are going to meet their one and only love interest only to find Downey has cheated on both of them. Instead of doing the right thing and leaving, they stick around and confront him. Somehow, in very short order,they all seem to make up quickly and surprisingly even have sex. Give me a break folks. I guess the message here was that you can be happy with two partners instead of one but it left me not caring about any of the characters. I'm as liberal as the next guy about the subject of sex but this was not even remotely realistic.  "}]
