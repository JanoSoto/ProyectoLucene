Not Quite","Date":"22 July 2006","Score":"30 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Every horror series has a black sheep. Friday the 13th had the Jason-less fifth installment, Halloween the Michael Meyers-less third entry, and A Nightmare on Elm Street the silly first sequel. For many fans, Child's Play 3 is the embarrassment of the Chucky saga. But why?So many reviews of this film express exacerbation, even confusion, over the sudden shift eight years into the future. What's so hard to understand? We had already had two movies with Chucky chasing a little kid. It was time to move the story along, hence our hero Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) is now a teenager at a military academy. This change of scenery was the breath of fresh air the series needed, as it opens up all kinds of new options to the murderous doll, which he fully exploits (paintball guns loaded with real ammo, anyone?).Other reviewers complain this just isn't scary. There they have a point, but how many gorefests actually bring our hands up to our eyes? Scariness is a great complement, but that doesn't mean the whole project goes down the tubes without it. Child's Play 3 has a smooth storyline, a touch of suspense and a truly memorable, original climax at a carnival (though it doesn't quite surpass the doll factory finale of the the previous film). Chucky's foul mouth begins to be a liability rather than an asset, but we can cut him some slack -- he's certainly never looked better (or more realistic).Child's Play 3 does have its ups and downs, however. The romance between Andy and a fellow cadet is a distraction, and there are times when our plastic star just seems brushed aside in favor of more serious moments. Chucky's desire to swap souls with someone other than Andy is a welcome change, but his new target, young Tyler, is one dimensional and uninteresting. He's unable to carry his scenes like Alex Vincent, who played child Andy in the first two films.As far as I'm concerned, this was the last of the true Child's Play films. Once this one was done, the series became a shameful, hokey parody of itself. This entry is by no means perfect and it's certainly not up the caliber of Child's Play 2. Yet it's not the piece of trash so many would have us believe. In fact, it may just be one of the most underrated theatrical horror films of the early '90s.

This comment will most likely receive a very low useful rating, but I'm OK with that. This movie was quite possibly my favorite of the Child's Play series. And although you will probably not agree, you will see what I meanThis movie takes place 8 years after the previous. Andy is now a teen and has been sent to a military academy. And guess what Chucky decided to tag along. This makes for a great story. Chucky really shows his true colors and sick, twisted sense of humor here. We also have an interesting group of characters here, who are actually worth mentioning. We have Andy of course, we have Tyler, a young cadet who catches Chucky's eye as a replacement of Andy; there's DeSilva, a tough girl who has a soft spot for Andy; we have Whitehurst, an outspoken, nerdy type who quickly befriends Andy; we have Shelton, a military-loving, tough, intimidating young man who has it in for Andy; and we have Botnik, an older guy, the barber who loves his job just a little too much. Together with these great characters is a great setting. There are some very interesting kills here which I have not even thought of or seen in any previous film. I do not understand why this movie is so underrated. Is it because of the time lapse? Maybe because Andy's not a kid? New setting? No matter what the reason, this movie deserves much more than a 4.1 rating (as of 3/7/08). I say it gets 9/10. Fans of the first 2 films will not want to miss this.

How is he resurrected? Well, apparently when eight years have passed the toy company reopens their Good Guy doll factory, removes the cobwebs off of all the old stock, pick the mutilated, dead Chucky doll up and pop him in a vat of boiling plastics. The springs of Lourdes never had so much healing power! This revives Chucky, and he instantly becomes his mean, killing machine of old and wants to find Andy Barclay to take his soul. Andy, played by Justin Whalin, is an older teenager now and enrolled at a military academy. Well, not to get too bogged down in a script that doesn't really merit such an intense analysis - Chucky finds Andy and continues to basically do what he did in the two earlier films. Lots of killing. Lots of wisecracks and that cackling laugh. Lots of the same. I did like this film more though than the second installment. First of all, the director did NOT repeat the problem of an overly long, seemingly never-ending death scene. The military school makes for an interesting backdrop to the story. The young actors do credible jobs. There are some interesting , quirky characterizations from the rest of the cast with Andrew Robinson stealing his scenes as a barber who really enjoys shaving the heads of the cadets. In fact I loved the little ponytails hung on the walls of his salon. A neat little addition. The story is nothing special though, and the film is very formulaic. It is entertaining if you - like me - have limited expectations.

Bride of chucky was pathetic) with its more humorous approach on the whole killer doll idea as well as being the more violent and macabre hence the '18' certificate. From the funny/cool one-liners such as Presto... your're dead, nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going, and the one above in online summary to Chucky's violent killings and chilling laughs you know this is gotta be better than 1 and 2. the music goes alongside the most chilling scenes well such as Chucky's resurrection in the factory and scenes of death.

"},{"Title":"Stretching the formula too far.","Date":"2 April 1999","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Set eights years after Child's Play 2, this sequel sees Andy Barclay attending Military School and getting bullied by the drill sergeant (poor man's Christian Slater Travis Fine, who never really became as popular as he should have been). Meanwhile, the Play Pals company has reopened the Good Guy factory and is starting production of the doll once more. But when clearing away Chucky's grisly remains, some of his blood spills into a vat of molten plastic and he is born once more in a new body.After a good old strangulation to get the circulation going he locates Andy at his military school and somehow figures out a way to mail himself there. However, once the package gets there it is promptly snatched by a very annoying, morbidly juvenile, and highly wimpy little kid called Tyler who has the same face as has-been 'singer' Craig David, only more annoying (if that is even possible). Since he has a new body Chucky reveals his birth name once more, hoping to get a fast and easy ticket out of his plastic shell. As before there are too many distractions.And as before the film spends way too much time with boring humans who spend too much time lurking in the dark wondering why a doll seems to appear and reappear and not enough time with Chucky. He IS the star of the show and he should OWN this movie. Alias and Lost director Jack Bender never really gives him the chance. Which is a shame since the animatronics had improved over Child's Play 2 and Chucky was beginning to look nastily cute. And more and more like Brad Dourif if you look hard enough. Bender's direction is slick but lacks edge, invention or humor. He seems to be ignorant of the potential Chucky has and treats the film like another mechanical TV series with no spark or signature. I remember when I first watched the VHS tape as a kid I immediately noticed how darker and gloomier this movie is, which ultimately leads to an overwhelming downbeat, depressing atmosphere, that sort of does and sort of doesn't work.The score is a major downer though. Greame Revell's wonderful orchestral adventure of Child's Play 2 has been replaced with a horrid synthesized, death-metal score filled with tacky and unimaginative stingers. Revell, fortunately, returned for Bride of Chucky.Child's Play 3 is no more than a competent sequel. Writer Don Mancini said he wasn't even ready to do a 3rd movie but Universal forced him to before the second was even released. As he was out of ideas he claims this film to be his least favorite of them all. If a better director were involved it could still have been a good film instead of being a merely an above average (by a tiny, tiny bit) one. "},{"Title":"It shows its diminishing returns although it's still watchable","Date":"22 June 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" As clearly stated by Don Mancini, the creator of the Child's Play franchise, Universal studios pushed him to begin writing a screenplay for this movie before Child's Play 2 (1990) was even ready to go. Thus, the result was that Mancini had no ideas left on how to continue the story of Charles Lee Ray, stuck in a Good Guy Doll's body. I mean can you blame him? It was baffling enough how in the name of all that's holy how to bring back Chucky from the original Child's Play (1988). Instead of being disassembled, Chucky's head was blown off this time. How do you bring someone back after that? Mancini found a way, but it's certainly not as forgivable as it was for the first sequel.The story surprisingly makes good use of its history and starts off with showing the aged and dusty factory of where the finale of the last film ended. There, the headless body of Chucky is melted down and remade. This apparently brings him back again. The continuity is great but how is that though? It was acceptable to a point in Child's Play 2 (1990) because the original body of Chucky was just dismembered and was cleaned off and reassembled. But to be first, missing a head, being melted down entirely and then remade? As much as the first resurrection was preposterous, the idea worked. Here, it just felt like a quick way to get Chucky back up. It's not like fans wouldn't want him back but a better method of rebirth would've been appreciated.Once up and running again, the lakeshore strangler immediately finds out where Andy Barclay is, but his plans abruptly change gears. Before he finds Andy, Chucky meets a new youngster named Tyler (who's also friends with Andy). There he decides that Tyler will be his new host. The new Andy is played by Justin Whalin, who later played Jimmy Olsen in the TV series, Lois and Clark. Whalin plays Andy as a sixteen-year-old, now in military school. Well that was a quick jump in time. One year passes between films and more than half a decade whizzes by our main protagonist. Whalin looks like he could be the older version of actor Alex Vincent (who originally played Andy) so that works. But what happened to Kyle from the last film? Much of the continuity is faithful to its predeceasing stories but the small things should be paid attention to as well. Instead of Kyle, Andy befriends another girl named De Silva (Perrey Reeves), there they form a friendly relationship in a tough school. The depiction of military school isn't as accurate as one would think here. Yes, there are drills and loud commands spouted out from superior officers but as a whole, it doesn't feel as intense as it could be. Nevertheless, Andy is the only character who believes Chucky still lives. Meanwhile, he's bullied by his superiors and fellow soldiers. No surprise there, nobody wants to be friends with Andy. It's sad, but at least this is the final film involving Chucky going after Barclay.Its not needed to be said but Brad Dourif of course entertains as Chucky. His dialog is still funny and you can't help but enjoy his performance as the angry doll that can't cut a break with finding a body to inhabit. More interesting is seeing actor Andrew Robinson from Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) have a small role as a barber to the school. His performance isn't memorable but is comical because as a barber to a military school, his obsession with keeping short hair goes beyond normalcy. He's just crazy about keeping short hair, a little too often. For gore, the violence feels in the middle to that of the first two movies. Nothing goes all out ugly like it did in Child's Play 2 (1990), but it's also not as tame as the violence in Child's Play (1988). Either way, it's intriguing to see what twisted methods Chucky has in store this time. The cinematography is mostly competent by John R. Leonetti. What he captures on screen isn't anything beautiful but there are times where the landscape is big which helps it feel like the place Andy is in, isn't a small school. Leonetti would go on to provide camera work for many Dead Silence (2007), The Mask (1994) and The Conjuring (2013). As for music, John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios score is a mixed bag. Instead of Graeme Revells more robust orchestral score from Child's Play 2 (1990), these TV composers revert back to Synthetic tones like that of Joe Renzetti's from the original composition of Child's Play (1988). Yet, without a main theme, this duo at least kept the music sounding creepy. It's hard to say. It's obvious that this production was rushed with its plot being dragged out on the same character but at least its tone didn't change.Its plot is recycled again and its justification for certain events are totally ignored but the main grab is to see how Andy and Chucky duke it out for the final time. It could've been written much worse by comparison.

That film was a modern re-imagining of the classic possessed doll theme, which was so silly that it ended up making me laugh. Aside from one scene where Catherine Hicks checks the doll for batteries, the film failed to scare, not to mention having a few plot twists that were just plain bad. Nevertheless the film was a modest hit, which led to two sequels (which were actually better).Six years after his last confrontation with Chucky the possessed doll, Andy Barclay has been sent to a military school. At the same time, the Play Pals toy factory has restarted its manufacturing of Good Guy dolls. Chucky's soul possesses the first one built &, after killing the Play Pals' president, mails himself to the military school. Andy must now try once again to defeat Chucky before he can regain human form by possessing one of the cadets.Like I already said, the series has lost its spark, which is actually a moot point since the creativity that made the first two films was running on used petrol fumes. Child's Play 3 has the exact same plot as its predecessors, with Andy Barclay trying once again to foil Chucky's plan to regain human form by possessing a human child (although this time around, Andy is no longer the target). While the original film offered a twisted commentary on the popularity of large life-like dolls & the second delved into the life of a foster family, this third film looks into life at a military school. Thus we have scenes where Justin Whalin arrives, only to be thrust into a harsh life, being singled out for abuse by the local sociopathic cadets. As is usual with these films, it's the Chucky show. This time, the doll kills his victims in ways that would make Freddy Krueger laugh. The first scene, where the president of the toy company is attacked by remote controlled toys, slipping on some marbles & finally strangled with a yoyo string, is quite creepy at first then turns routine (how does Chucky learn computer skills?). The other kills are milked for all the dark humour they contain &#x96; Chucky crushes one victim in a garbage truck, slits the throat of the demented hairdresser & kills the school's leader by scaring him to death, saying You've got to be &#x85; kidding me as he watches the man die of a heart attack. Plus the way Chucky sabotages the war games by switching the paintball rounds of the rifles with real bullets is positively original.The acting is decent enough for these sorts of films, with Justin Whalin playing the outsider with a troubled past quite effectively. Perrey Reeves & Dean Jacobson provide adequate support while Brad Dourif (the only actor to star in all three films) is hilarious as Chucky, once again proving to be the star of the show.

Sure, it's harmless, but it's just another excuse to beat a dead doll. Chucky's back, and again it's a preposterous reincarnation and introduction. We find him stalking little Andy (now a teen in a military reform school) again, despite part two's explanation that Chucky can't transfer his lost soul into the boy anymore. Some of the humor's there, my favorite was the Colonel's death mixed with Chucky's surprise and disappointment. Thankfully, now that Andy's grown a bit, he's played by a much better actor that has some (I said some) range. I also liked him in the 'Lois & Clark' Jimmy role (he was in 2-4, replacing the dud they hired for Jimmy in season 1.) And I admit some of the lines Chucky used was mildly funny as well as the conclusion in the seemingly never ending haunted house was appropriate for the series. Unfortunately, the whole movie was just another remake of #1-2 and the inconsistencies and plot holes were fairly large. Would they really put sharp knifes in the haunted house? Would someone seriously not report a death that just happened and go off to play a game? Yeah, I'm looking too deep. It's safe to skip #2 and #3 and return when Chucky returns in full force in 'Bride of Chucky.'

I think the plot worked well, much better than CP2's, and actually carried the movie. I like CP3's mix of fun and suspense. It limits the viciousness enough to still have fun, and I think this works very well. The writing and set design work great together. The slightly quirky look and feel of the characters really makes them feel realistic, more so than in many horror flicks from the time. And the acting is decent too. The script is clever enough. It supplies some good one-liners, decent dialog, and scary, tense set pieces. The military setting is also very gritty and fun. The effects are decent too. Chucky still talks realistically, and moves his arms and legs well. There are drawbacks though, like the issue I've seen in many of these films, where Chucky is standing there without moving his legs at all and people are running from him, but he doesn't seem to be a threat at all. But this only happens once. Other than that, he still moves pretty well, and the gore FX are excellent.

Understandable because this is definitely the weakest one in the series, but it is one of those movies that I like but everyone else hates. Does this movie have flaws? Yes, but that doesn't mean that you still can't enjoy it.The film starts as Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif is rebuilt again(which you think they would've learned after the first two movies) 8 years after the events of Child's Play 2. He is raging mad and wants to find where Andy is. It turns out Andy now played by Justin Whalin has been sent to a military camp to straighten him out after his killer doll story. One night Chucky comes across a young boy named Tyler played by Jeremy Sylvers and Chucky decides that instead of chasing after Andy again, he can transfer his soul into Tyler who is friends with Andy.The problems with the film. The first being the doll effects which I consider to be the weakest of the franchise and thankfully they were vastly improved in 1998's Bride Of Chucky. The second being the acting which feels very stale with Whalin. He doesn't have the charm that Alex Vincent had in the first two movies. The third and final one being the tone of the film. This film is very dark compared to the first two. Now the second film went about 10% darker than the first but knew it's limits. Here they go full force especially the last 15 minutes which take place in a carnival. This film was the sort of start of making the films more of a horror comedy.The good of the movie. The first being the voice acting of Brad Dourif which I have praised before and I am going to praise again. he is just that good however he is best in Child's Play and Bride Of Chucky. He is the perfect one for the role and should be nominated for an award for his voice work which I am surprised has not happened... yet.The next are two things. The first is that the doll effects sometimes can manage to be creepy and scary when a scene calls for it. Next we have the army setting which I find very clever that Chucky is running around an army camp and I really do like that his main focus is not his main priority which is good at least for me because if Andy was portrayed by Alex Vincent again I would be saying the exact opposite.Lastly we have the climax which is, like the last film is the best part of the film. The climax takes place inside of a carnival, specifically in a haunted house ride which actually takes apart of Chucky's skin and has a very bloody look on his face. Effective, yes. Realistic, no.The Final Verdict for the film Child's Play 3 is 3 Stars Out Of 4. The film has good effects, great voice work and a cool climax but is held back by stale acting by Whalin, and too much of a dark tone. I suggest watching it because you can have some fun with it.Rated R For Horror Violence And Language.1hr 30min/90min.17 uses of the F-word.Cost $13,000,000.Box Office $20,560,255.IMDb Rating 4.6/10.Rotten Tomatoes Rating 23% Rotten.My Rating ***/**** "},{"Title":"Not as good as Child's Play....","Date":"3 November 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" I thought that Child's Play 3 was not as good as the first film.

Also, I have certain hopes that the later films will be better... I must say, after a disappointing first and an atrocious sequel, Child's Play 3 is currently the best one I've seen of the series. First of all, Andy has finally grown up, meaning we were spared the unprofessional, uninspiring, unauthentic and unconvincing acting skills of Alex Vincent (again, sorry, I know he was just a kid, but have a look at all the amazing child actors and actresses of modern Horror who surpass Vincent in any and all ways possible). Having Justin Whalin (Jimmy from Lois and Clark!) as the main lead was almost enough to salvage the film. Almost.So, Chucky is alive again. How? Doesn't matter! Since nothing (absolutely nothing) about the films so far has been remotely reasonable or realistic, director Jack Bender and screenwriter Don Mancini had simply decided to avoid any explanations of how Chucky's soul was transferred to another (identical, of course) doll. Friendly reminder - in the 2nd film we learn that Chucky has been stuck in the doll for too long, and can no longer use the Dambella voodoo to move his soul to a live body. Never mind. Now there's a new doll, Chucky is conveniently stuck in it, why bother paying attention to plot holes?Now Chucky is on the loose again, and has a chance to finally settle the score with Andy, and move his soul to an older body which would allow him to enjoy the delicate pleasures of life. No! Chucky will instead choose another 7-9 year old as his target, because logic is redundant!So what's the good part? The characters (besides Whalin, the gorgeous Perrey Reeves is great as De Silva, adding a little romance to the tale, and Travis Fine is excellent as Shelto, the bully we all love to hate) are better, more intriguing and more relatable (not to mention better played). The story and plot are also better, because of the nice setting (a military school which in all things considered reminds the setting of Friday the 13th) and the increasing suspense. This time, instead of waiting for the next screw-up and for the film to finally end, I found myself actually curious as to how the events will eventually unfold.All in all? Not a good film in general, only by comparison to the first two. Still entertaining enough to deserve a merciful 6.

It didn't help that an (undeserved) fuss was kicked up over its links with the Jamie Bolger murder case when it was released on VHS here in the UK; a factor that saw it banned for a decade before finally making its way onto late-night telly. CHILD'S PLAY 3 is an undistinguished horror sequel; nothing more or less than a B-movie, but I still liked it better than CHILD'S PLAY 2. It doesn't seem like a rehash this time; it changes setting to a soldier cadet school and the resulting shenanigans are at least entertaining here.A good design was made in setting this one 8 years down the line; annoying child actor Alex Vincent is gone, to be replaced by annoying teenager Justin Whalin. Still, there are some good supporting roles for the likes of HELLRAISER's Andrew Robinson as a crazy military hairdresser and Travis Fine as a jock/bully type. Perrey Reeves makes for a feisty female sidekick while Jeremy Sylvers as the token child actor is far more appealing than his predecessor; it also goes without saying that Brad Dourif, returning as Chucky, puts in another hilarious voice performance.There's more plotting here than before, but it doesn't get in the way of some cheesy murders. Fun's to be had when a paintball game turns deadly, while Chucky's denouement in a ghost train ride is mildly entertaining in its own way, although unbelievable as health and safety would have shut this fairground down long ago, what with its grim reapers wielding real scythes and massive open fan blades spinning on the floor next to the trains. CHILD'S PLAY 3 is far from a good film, but at least it isn't boring &#x96; something I can't say for the mind-numbing part two, a film I've forgotten about just one day after I saw it.

Much like the rest of the series, the film gets quite a lot of mileage from the fact that Chucky's true identity is hidden away far into the film as once again there's plenty of walking in at just the wrong moment to catch him alive. The fight in the barracks where he first reveals himself to Andy and the later scene where he sneaks in trying to steal him back that ends up alerting only him in the room are quite nicely handled, as well as the incidents around the academy that are more than just accidental deaths with the way they continually occur around here. The death of their leader in the office and the barber which gets witnessed that not only works well here but also come off as rather fun scenes overall that builds up quite well. All of this builds up really nicely to the big final half here which has a lot of frantic action and big suspense throughout. This starts off with the paint-ball game itself which is quite possibly among the best scenes in the series with the formations and scouting, the searching in the woods once they get wind of the situation mistakenly taking him to be a spy which sets up the overall fun and enjoyment of the double-cross and resulting shootout which is quite fun at the demented and cruel air this gives the film, and leads into the fun of the carnival finale as the stalking through the hordes of people there and how it manages to find itself into the attraction is outstanding. That in itself is more great fun with the different stalking and interactions throughout the settings inside before the over-the-top fun of getting to the big resolution that transpires here. Along with some really fine kills and the start of the series' turn for the comedic in terms of his sayings and expressions, these here are enough to hold this up against the minor flaws here. Much like the previous entry, this one again tends to be set-up in tone and execution like the original which isn't based on anything new or creative with its storyline here and it's rather uncreative. Likewise, this also causes the other problem here as this one tends to be a little too far-fetched in how the kids here take to believe the story, as not only is there way too much evidence that something's going on but that they don't start matching the clues together as they really do make sense that something's happening. That doesn't impact this one as much as the others did with that, but it sticks out enough to slightly lower this.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy.

There is a lot more humor and over the gore in this third installment. And the suspense that made the first one great is gone. Its Brad Dourfs voice acting that keeps me from giving this movie a one star. Setting the movie at military school seems like a good idea. It explains what happened to Andy. But we don't care.

It's like they wanted a military setting with a villain (like in other horror movies in that kind of setting) and thought up the closes way to execute that. But it falters because of a crappy script and poorly written characters that are more annoying than entertaining or stands out. There are more characters this time around, but they are so darn insignificant to the plot. Even the romance between Andy and DeSilva is more distracting over having a well crafted chemistry between the two. The chemistry between Andy and Kyle was done much better. This just wasn't a impactful way to end the Child's Play trilogy before it goes in the comedic parody direction. Although Chucky is evil and more sadistic than he has ever been, most of the characters and most of the screen-time is taken up with them just walking around and looking at Chucky in a dumbfounded manner. There is now no logic and constant loopholes when it comes to the revival of Chucky. In the first movie to kill Chucky it's to destroy his heart. The second installment revived Chucky by putting his skull on another body. This time you can just revive Chucky with his blood alone, which doesn't make sense since they tried to revive him by taking him apart and adding new parts in the second installment. Which would lead him to bleed as well, but does not. Maybe because it was before he fully became human inside a dolls body. The main complaint about the second installment is the lack of blood, gore and violence when it came to the kills. Even for a horror comedy this is just bland and not really funny, nor does it have suspense. Chucky is not after Tyler's body over Andy's body, which contradicts the rules of the first Child's Play movie. Tyler is another character that they probably put in to be this cute little innocent child, but just came off annoying after a while. Andy has grown up and isn't the cute kid anymore, but is more of a wuss this time around. The military school environment could have been a interesting direction, I was in a military school before so it brought back some nostalgic memories. But WAY more crazy stuff went down when I was in the military school. They really did run out of ideas when it came to this 3rd installment. Some may like the second one better, I personally think this 3rd one is the worst compared to the previous 2.3.9/10 "},{"Title":"Don't f****ck* With the Chuck!

Here he is a teenager, and attending military school to try and straighten out his life. His mother is mentally ill, and Andy has nowhere to turn. He meets friends, and even finds love. What he doesn't realize is that Chucky hasn't forgotten about Andy, and he's on the prowl for him once more to get out of the doll, and into a new bodyChucky suffers from the very same syndrome that many other horror icons do. I liked to call it sequelitis Where the series cares more about making the big bucks, than it does making sure the hardcore fans are entertained. Chucky has ventured into Freddy Krueger territory, by cracking all the one-liners that he can. This is a good, and a bad thing. The one-liners are amusing, but like Freddy, Chucky became looked at as funny, rather than frightening. This has a pretty cool opening, with a rather gory Chucky resurrection sequence, which leads into the opening credits. I also dug Chucky's first kill. The way they set it up was actually quite funny and suspenseful at the same time. Chucky is a mean bastard when it comes to killing people. We do get the dreaded off screen deaths, but this sequel is pretty good when it comes to gore. We get a bloody slit throat, stabbings, gunshot wounds, beating with a golf-club, and the finale at the amusement park will have gore hounds howling. It's some pretty nasty stuff. My main problem with this sequel is that there were too many missed opportunities, storyline wise. The ending from Child's Play II is ignored, which is kind of a shame.They could have at least pulled a Halloween V with this one, and have Christine Elise (Kyle) from the second movie, make an appearance, and kill her off, or&#x85; They could have had Andy & his Mother on the road, with Chucky chasing them down. They had plenty of better things they could have done. It takes place a YEAR later, a YEAR. Yet you butcher the storyline by having Andy join the army, and befriend that dinky nuisance of a kid, Tyler? Come on! It was just so moronic. Aside from the fun, gory times at the amusement park, the finale was awful. It turns into a mini war battle of sorts, and it just got ludicrous. I get they wanted to add in some action, but it lacked suspense, and came across as superficial, like much of this movie. Brad Douriff rocks as Chucky once again. Justin Whalin is actually not bad as Andy. He's a bit wishy-washy at times, but overall I dug his innocence, his vulnerability, and the fact that he tried hard. Too bad he's in a crappy movie. Perry Reeves (DaSilva, and of Entourage fame) is solid for the most part. She's certainly pretty to look at, and her character had bravado when it was needed. Her love story with Andy felt forced and contrived, though. Jeremy Sylvers grated me to no end. I have a big problem with many kid actors, and he was no different. When someone says Let's play hide the soul You RUN! I don't care how old you are, its common sense. His character was silly. Dean Jacobson plays a scumbag extremely well as Whitehurst. I felt like backhanding him on many occasions. Andrew Robinson steals every scene he's in as the maniacal barber. He was hilarious, and a lot of fun to watch. Kiss it goodbye! couldn't resist adding that quote. The acting isn't the problem here. Final Thoughts It's watchable, but it lacks excitement and suspense for the most part.

"}{"Title":"Is it just me, or does Tyler seem to have some sort of bizarre amorous fixation on Chucky?","Date":"13 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" This third chapter of the chronicles of Chucky is so disjointed and nonsensical that it seems apparent the filmmakers couldn't decide between three rough concepts of what Child's Play 3 should be about, so they simply cobbled all of them together into this patchwork entry.Idea number one continues the plot thread centered around the Play Pal Toy Company's refusal to discontinue their Good Guy dolls explored in Child's Play 2, and when production resumes, blood from Chucky's remains is inadvertently mixed into a vat of plastic utilized to make the toys, allowing him to be reincarnated in an all new body. While the boiling cauldron of plastic appears to be massive enough to supply the skin for hundreds of Good Guys, and Chucky's vital fluid taints the entire batch, somehow this only results in a single doll being occupied by his soul, which seems like a real missed opportunity. An army of Chuckys would have been a bit silly, sure, but that result would definitely have a lot more potential than the dreck we end up sifting through here.Actually, the prologue has some promise, and the prolonged stalking murder of a Play Pal executive recalls Chucky's suspenseful buildups and playful sadism from the first film. As the introduction rolls on, we get the sense that we're in store for a darker and more purely horror-based film than Child's Play 2, which is a refreshing notion. Unfortunately, this impression is negated when the affair proceeds to phase two.The second concept is by far the dumbest of the lot, and sadly takes up the bulk of the film. The Andy character from the first two installments is reintroduced, but now he's a teenager enrolled in a military academy. Chucky locates him and is able to continue pursuing his nemesis at Andy's new stomping grounds by mailing himself to the military installation (have fun trying to figure out how Chucky is able to wrap the Good Guy box in brown paper, tape it up, get himself to a post office, and pay for the shipping... all while he's physically sealed inside the package). The parcel is intercepted by an annoying kid named Tyler (who is juvenile enough to initially believe there isn't anything strange about a doll that talks to him and moves around on its own, but is also somehow considered mature enough to participate in military training exercises), and when our impish killer realizes that he has a new candidate for his ever-elusive body transfer, Tyler becomes Chucky's target for a game of hide the soul. The locale makes way for the film to pack in a score of boot camp movie clich√©s, including a verbally abusive commander, hazing of the hapless cadet who can't get his act together, and, most brazenly, a reprise of the this is my rifle, this is my gun... mantra from Full Metal Jacket. Despite this being a military installation, Chucky is somehow able to wander around at will undetected (guard duty apparently isn't part of the rigorous program), and at one point he even sneaks into the armory before a combat training exercise and switches out an entire squad's paint-ball rounds with live ammunition, a gag that goes unnoticed by these astute soldiers-to-be until after they've already fired off dozens of shots and killed one of their commanding officers.Things get dumber and dumber as the plot moves forward, and Chucky eventually wraps an ammo belt around his torso like Rambo for no apparent reason and secures a convenient doll-sized pistol to engage in a gun battle with our protagonists. Chucky also orchestrates a hostage situation, which concludes with him throwing a readily available hand grenade at the responding soldiers (because hand grenades are apparently routinely issued to cadets when they go out into the forest to shoot paint-balls at each other).The climax marks the third section of the film, in which Chucky absconds with Tyler and lures his pursuers to a carnival. This segment is by far the most effective, largely because the final showdown takes place inside an elaborate horror-themed roller coaster ride, which is way cooler than anything else in the movie. Andy and Chucky do battle with Tyler's potentially possessed body hanging in the balance, and while Chucky's eventual demise is gruesome and satisfying, the Tyler character is so off-puttingly idiotic that we end up rooting for him to die instead.Though this entry boasts quite a bit more gore than the previous outing, the extra red sauce isn't enough to transcend the limitations of the brain-dead story and largely rote kill scenes. The Chucky effects are predictably solid, and he has a few good one-liners, but the Freddy Krueger-esque zingers that accompany each murder get old fast.The series would of course go in a much different direction after this misguided dud, which is a very savvy move because I don't think I'd be on board for any more installments if they adhered to this tired formula. Don't get me wrong, I'm always game for mindless fun, but in Child's Play 3 the mindless definitely outweighs the fun.

Continuity is very much an issue in these movies, so I expected nothing less in this case. I never watch these movies expecting them to follow the story lines. I view them as individual films with the same characters.

Can Andy convince the others that the doll is more than it seems? And will Chucky be able to get his soul into a human host before being dismembered once again? Whilst it is true that this is a little bit by the numbers, it is nevertheless an enjoyable enough affair, the star turn of course being the always excellent Brad Dourif's voicing of Chucky, giving the animated puppet a real air of menace.Whilst by movie number 3 most horror franchises start to play things for laughs, this one is played admirably straight, aside from the occasional one liner from Chucky after a killing. Also of note is a fine, if minimal, performance from Andrew 'Hellraiser' Robinson as a sadistic barber. Whilst not a classic, fans of the first two should be happy enough. "},{"Title":"Typical B-movie","Date":"1 July 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" I was not that big on the original CHILD'S PLAY film. I thought it had some genuinely good scares and was very well made, but it's second half came off too forced and far too weak. The second film took the concept of the killer doll from the first film and went all the way with it without any fear or limits or any sense of morality and good taste. It was a gleefully fun gorefest of a horror picture and it was one of the most entertaining horror films of it's time. How could they top the second film? Well, they couldn't. Turns out they decided to cop-out and bring the series back to it's roots. That means that there's no more crazy bloodletting, no more tastelessness, and no more good scares. Instead they made it like the first film. Lots of dialogue, lots of story, lots of elaboration, but the killing spree doesn't start until the second half. As a result, this film comes off very bland and very forced in all the wrong ways. While it does have a lot of funny dialogue, a lot of weird scenes, and a couple of good kill scenes, it's still just more of the same of the first film. However, the first film did it better. This one takes place at a military base with a different kid being the prey for Chucky. Nothing special. Brad Dourif's voicework is top-notch as usual, but there's no real hook to this film. There's nothing to keep you interested. You just want to see the doll. To be fair, you do get plenty of the doll. However, there won't be much else.Overall, if you're a fan of the franchise then by all means see it. It's not terrible, but it's not terribly exciting either. Don't expect much in terms of horror or gore. Just expect some silliness, some weirdness, some campy qualities, and a lot of scenes with a talking doll. "}{"Title":"Child's Play 3 (1991)","Date":"5 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" There are train wrecks. Sad things; they usually take place down here. And then, there are train wrecks that take place in the sky. Because the transportation conductor running the show is higher than a kite, has absolutely no idea what they're doing, and won't be bothered to look on the road ahead to ensure an accident does not lie up ahead. I thought Child's Play 2 was a train wreck, the sort that would fit this description. I was wrong. I thought that was as low as this series could go and the next film just had to be better somehow. I was mistaken there as well. I am passionately anti-drug, but I want to know what writer Don Mancini was smoking when he wrote these early sequels. Did someone lace his cigars with angeldust? And this isn't because they're in any way Fantasia-like, or anything like that. It's because of how unbelievably insane the ideas are.First, Andy was never a complex character. You felt bad for the child actor playing him in the first two movies, he was very sympathetic. But there was nothing really going on inside him. He was not an important part of the franchise. I could watch a hundred movies (if I were forced to) with Chucky just running around, stabbing people and swearing at them, and never once go- where's Andy? So, the kid grows up or his parents don't want him in anymore of the movies. I can live with that. I can even accept that Mancini decided to write him as a teenager, since he wrote him into a role that I'm naturally attracted to watching- the introverted, misunderstood, slightly strange, put-upon loner. But that's where this movie's greatest flaws lie.Let's just start with how whiny and irritating the sniveling, prepubescent Justin Whalin is. At least when John Waters cast him in Serial Mom, he was supposed to be irritating. Here, it's like they think it's an added perk. The character is already such a miserably lame goody-two-shoes, who - even though he's supposed to be mentally fragile and disturbed - leaps at every chance to stop the evil Chucky from killing, even though everyone Chucky targets are oppressing him in some way. If he were really disturbed, wouldn't there be some part of him that was happy people were being murdered? He's basically the Carrie or the Angela Baker (Sleepaway Camp) of this movie, being tormented by stern, judgmental sergeants and sadistic lieutenant cadets drilling and taunting him. Several cadets lashing out at him or threatening him. This situation was just begging for a playfully evil bite of sweet revenge.But, no... That would have been too experimental or risky. Instead of being mean spirited toward the tormentors, Universal horror movies of this era were all about being mean spirited toward the victims (especially Wes Craven's films for the studio). Then at the last minute, the sadistic jerks who drove you crazy get knocked down by a bullet or they bump their head on the ceiling (1989's Shocker), and that's it. That's all they get as a penalty for the evil they perpetrated and the pain they caused to the protagonists (say that 5 times fast). We get no satisfaction of revenge. No reparations. Nada. In fact, if anything the worst characters in the movie get the quickest, least painful deaths. What kind of justice is that? What ever happened to- what goes around comes around?Or, if Andy can't be morally vague- what about his twin brother, Whitehurst? He's so physically low head-hung, moping around, defeated in every way. It'd be no stretch at all to show him laughing evilly or smiling a little at the sight of the ensuing carnage. As it stands, he's the only truly interesting character in the movie (played to perfection by the quintessentially nerdy Dean Jacobson). Another bright spot, though not nearly as bright, is the vivacious and energetic Perrey Reeves as the sassy DaSilva. The only cadet to be able to knock king-jerk of the jerk-pile Brett C. Shelton (played by the gorgeous, ultra-masculine Travis Fine, who you may remember as the orderly who loses his job because of Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted) off his pedestal. And because I don't like to leave anyone out, she has a friend who is also enjoyable to watch, played by Donna Eskra.With a movie this embarrassing, it's best not to dwell too much more on the negatives. So, as a final positive, I'll say that the movie does have a cool ending. Not a great one, but a cool one. You can thank Universal Studios directly for that. There's no doubt that the idea surely had something tied-in with Universal's world-famous amusement parks. This setting actually became amazingly popular for horror films and thrillers in the 1990's (Dr. Giggles, Fear, True Crime- the one with Alicia Silverstone). Here, it's a house of horrors type roller-coaster ride that takes the car passengers up a mountain. Or something. You will marvel at it, surrender now. It's truly awesome-looking. As is the famous Chucky doll when the Grim Reaper's scythe slices half his face off. You just gotta love those Kevin Yagher special effects, they look incredible.

In Part 2, Chucky was also rebuilt with new plastic. Why didn't the Good Guy think of that then? Andy should've stayed Chuck's main goal cause the Tyler (Sylvers) crap got played out real fast.Setting the film in a military school is a good idea but why didn't they milk it more?Another thing having an amusement park right next to a military academy is hard to swallow. On the grounds they handle guns, grenades, what-not, and there's no way they would build a park near all that. The only reason the park is there is so the movie can have a groovy location in which to set its finale&#133;. felt kind of cheap. Speaking of the finale, the haunted house is kool but what's up with that huge open fan or that Grim Reaper that swooshes his real blade at the kids. This park is just begging to get closed down.This sequel also repeats Part Two's biggest mistake. Most of the side characters are solely there to be Chucky meat fodder and I knew that. One thing I didn't need was overextended stalk sequences involving characters I couldn't give a damn about. Take the opening murder for example. It takes forever to get to the point! I was yelling out loud Kill the guy already! I know he's going to die; you don't have to take 10 minutes to get to the killing! The film not a total loss though Chucky is still his usual humorous self and does his best despite the lazy script.Justin Whalin plays Andy this time around He has a baby face that works and he shows the right amount of vulnerability. Perrey Reeves (De Silva) is solid as the tough chick Jeremy Sylvers (Tyler) does oBrad Dourif (Voice of Chucky) does it again, his squeaky voice never gets old.All in all only Hardcore Chucky fans will get a kick out of this others will find this movie unsatisfactory.

Anyhow the third instalment of the murderous good guy doll possessed by the serial killer Charles Lee Ray sees an older teenage Andy Barclay settling in to military school. But with the resurrection of the once popular Good Guys dolls, Chucky is brought back to life and once again tracks down Andy. But after finding him, Chucky sets his eyes upon the young Ronald Tyler who discovers his secret. So now Chucky is trying rid Andy, so that he won't get in the way him transferring his soul in to Tyler.So really the premise is the same with only a slight slant to the formula. Even with its well-worn mechanics and lacking chills it's enjoyably fun, if quite a mean-spirited and forceful sequel. I was liking it until just after halfway when it loses its way and transcends into cheap silliness. Watch as each film goes on to wallow in the wicked black humour, by never taking itself entirely serious. The script (which almost goes on to play everything as a joke because it seems they can only go to that angle) manages to throw a smart little quip for Chucky to spit out whenever on screen. Strangely the puppet design doesn't fair up that well compared to the previous films, but I rather take this vividly etched creation than anything resembling computer generated effects.The performances are engaging enough. Justin Whalin is modest in the part as the older Andy and Perry Reeves kicks up some fire as Andy's love interest. Brad Dourif dependably returns to be everyone's favourite Good Guy Doll Chucky once again. That wicked tone and driving cackle have just become a constant trademark. In support there's a lively Andrew Robinson and a hard-nosed Travis Fine. Jeremy Sylvers suitably plays it na√Øve as Tyler.Director Jack Bender (more renown for his TV work) professionally caters for the production in quite a mechanical fashion. Few amusing death scenes crop up and a playful energy is created. The score is mostly well-placed with its burning rock cues which vibrate an ominous charge.Not the complete dead horse many make it out to be.

The director does a good job of pulling us into the story, even for those who haven't seen the first two; like me. We understand what's going on with very little expose' into the first two. The puppetry work is just what the doctor ordered with Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky; aka Charles(the former mass murderer who somehow was put inside this doll's body). He is reborn when the toy manufacturer decides to bring back the Good Guy doll series and his goal is to get out of the doll's body and into a human one. He hunts down his former owner, who is now 16 years old, at a military school and start wreaking havoc from this point on. Suttle performances by the actors without too much over-the-top violence makes this movie entertaining without being a gross-out experience. And forgive me, but it's hard not to laugh when Chucky spouts out obscenities in this doll's body. It's just ironic enough to make you giggle. The Chucky performance sells the show, but just the way this movie is put together keeps you on your toes and looking forward to other entries in the series.

The director (Jack Bender) is right in turning some unsuccessful (un-)creepy moments into pure comic (e.g.,the scene with a kid,Tyler,being caught by Cochrane playing hide the soul with Chucky in the armory;or,the doll who watches Andy kissing Kristin De Silva;or Chucky's dialogs with Tyler,the kid;or,Chucky being embellished with lipstick,by De Silva--can you make a horror with such stuff?).Also,there are Chucky's corrosive jokes,bad language,grumpy and gruesome jests and delicious,jaunty remarks;I agree these make Chucky a slap-up,and a very picturesque and even nice character,but not a creepy slasher.He gives every scene he's in a clownish twist.There still remains a whole lot to be enjoyed in Child's Play 3 (1991) .The doll is very funny and its whole role is an intentionally comic one.They chose to make the doll more buffoonish and blubbering--not at all scary.This movie should be estimated within these choices.It's rather a movie for those who want an extra bonus with Chucky as a classic.Maybe Child's Play 3 (1991) will not make converts to the Good Guy flicks,it won't proselytize,but it should please those already converted by the previous movies (like myself).This is not a horror,but a quite suspenseful flick.It gets even cynical,as you can't hate the Good Guy Chucky if you come to almost sympathize with him.The two major errors were(1)to make too much of a comical character out of Chucky,to give him too many funny lines,etc.,a thing that is very good in itself,but destroys any creepy effect;this is not silly,though;(2)the director seems unable to choose between a horror and a good comedy (because this movie could have been either).A third mistake would be the absence of adults' roles.More recently,the same Jack Bender did some also great job on TV (Lost ,Ally McBeal ).Some people cowardly decreed that Child's Play 3 is a bad,etc.,movie?Well,that doesn't surprise me,since some people (others or the same,I don't care) unconscionably decreed that even Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) ,Enterprise ,Star Trek Insurrection (1998) ,A Prayer for the Dying (1987),Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991),are also bad movies!Shame on them.

While this movie has no real scares or thrills to offer it actually comes out better than the last two Child's Play movies for a few reasons. For one, as Andy is now in his teen years and has his hormones starting to show it makes for a more serious tone compared to the silliness of the eight-year-old Andy from the last. Also, the fact that the movie is at a military school also makes for a bit more seriousness. Also, Chucky is as lovable as ever, still holding up with his cruel but somewhat charming personality. However, Child's Play 3 finds problems besides little to no scares or thrills. For instance, the movie acts like a long TV show, not managing to pull off any real development in the characters or plot. The movie also seems rushed in a way, like the crew wanted to end the movie as quickly as possible but make it long enough. Yet, the movie does feel more complete and satisfying compared to its predecessors. It's just a shame that the actors are cheesy one minute but then almost serious the next.

Of course, he was meaner in the first one, but that is to be expected. The kills are good, especially the barber. Presto, you're dead! Classic. In this one, Chucky is now going after a little black kid named Tyler. He has a new body and doesn't have to go after Andy again, but he still pursues him. Andy is now a teenager and has entered a military school. Chucky is sent to Andy, but Tyler opens him instead and this is where Chucky starts going after Tyler. Chucky runs amok in the school, even replacing paint balls with real bullets towards the end of the film. The carnival part at the end is definitely memorable, and this should have ended the Child's Play series, seeing as how there is no way in hell anyone could have found all of Chucky's body parts.All in all, this is my second favorite Child's Play film and I just don't see why no one likes this. People like Seed and Bride better than this, which is downright idiotic! This is a good film, but the only complaint I have is Tyler's ignorance to the fact that Chucky is swearing and has a mind of his own, yet he thinks that is how the doll really is.Don't f**k with the Chuck!

CHUCKY'S funeral came in 1991, the same year that Freddy's Dead put an end to the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise. Ok, Chucky and Freddy returned in 2 sequels each one (Bride of Chucky, Seed of Chucky, New Nightmare, and Freddy VS Jason) but their true death came in the early 90's before their franchise became commercial and followed the weak SCREAM series standards.*SPOILERS* Anyways, in CHILD'S PLAY 3 Chucky returns and once again starts the hunt for Andy. Ten years have passed since the events of the original movie, Andy is now 16 and he's sent to a Military school. Chucky sends himself in mail destined to Andy...yes, it actually happens. This time Chucky terrorizes the Military school and it's students, plus the barber, a garbage man, and a Coronel. There's little gore, average acting and direction, an ok score, and a tired Chucky that seemed to lost the touch. Andy isn't useful anymore for Chucky as he finds in the young Tyler his new body prospect. Chucky tells Tyler his secret and tries to perform on him the ritual to translate his soul to his body. Chucky gets wiser with the years and has renewed his killing methods (like changing paint bullets with real bullets). Believe it or not, Chucky's scary looks are enough to kill someone. Tyler is two times cowarder than Andy, so they join forces and with the aid of the beautiful De Silva (Andy also shows interest in girls!) they manage to escape and destroy Chucky.  The ending disappointed me, Chucky deserved a better death for his final death (at the time). To make it brief, Andy throws Chucky to a BIG fan... You have to watch to believe.Chucky lost respect after part 2, he's not menacing or scary anymore, and worst of all, his one-liners are awful (in the style of Freddy). The locations didn't help the film, Chucky looked awkward and not blood thirsty. CHILD'S PLAY III is not entertaining, it's a major let down, as the original and part 2 were decent horror films.

They play like one, long movie, when played back to back. This installment is no exception, and a deserving sequel.However, I somehow did not care for this movie as much as the first two. It is modernized, and they tried a bit bigger budget here, which spoiled the camp of the first two. They tried to add more of the suspenseful aspects of the originals to this one, and in My opinion, they fell a bit short in doing so. It does, however, have a darker feel and there is more gore (one of the sequel rules), but somehow it just falls a little beneath the others.I think perhaps that it is due to the vulgar language used by Chucky. It makes him come of as an obnoxious bad little child, rather than the serial killer/voodoo bocur he was in the first two. It degrades his character's worth and makes it appear superficial, rather than the deeply disturbed psychopath who is trapped in the body of a doll, and is slowly going insane from the frustration given to him by Andy in the first two installments. I mean...what guy wouldn't go insane from the total lack of their wedding tackle? The added darker elements should have made this one a better endeavor, but for Me, there's something missing.

Chucky tracks down Andy (Justin Whalin) who is now grown up and in military school but after realising he has a new body Chucky decides to try and possess a young kid named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers) rather than try and possess Andy. Andy finds out about Chucky's diabolical scheme and makes it his mission to stop him, however, as well as Chucky he is going to have to contend with a power-mad Lieutenant named Shelton (Travis Fine).A little different from the previous two instalments, albeit mainly because virtually the entire movie takes place in a Military School, &#145;Child's Play 3' is slightly better than the previous instalment but still seems a rather unnecessary sequel. This is the first of the &#145;Child's Play' films to not feature Alex Vincent in the role of Andy as the makers opted for an older Andy in this movie and Justin Whalin portrays the character rather well though one would question whether Andy would not possibly be in an institution rather than a military school, and wouldn't he have some serious mental issues? There are quite a few plot holes in the story and some very bad scripting in parts but as sequels go &#145;Child's Play 3' is about average for a third sequel to an average movie and will probably entertain the Chucky fans at least once. Don Mancini once again wrote the screen play for the movie though this time Jack Bender took the directors chair and didn't really improve on the direction from John Lafia in the second. Tom Holland's direction in the original film was probably what made &#145;Child's Play' such a viable franchise and though these future instalments gave the fans what they wanted (more screen time for Chucky, more blood, more victims) they also failed to add any interesting twists. A film centered on a killer doll is bound to be rather bland but more should have been done to make the film more entertaining, adding a new `victim' just was not enough. Like with the previous two movies there were a lot of seemingly pointless or over-suspended scenes which made the movie drag rather than be entertaining.The acting was pretty poor from most of the cast except Justin Whalin, though Travis Fine did a half-decent job of playing the loathsome Lt. Shelton and Perrey Reeves was quite likeable (in a similar way to the character of Kyle in the second) as Andy's romantic interest De Silva.If you are a fan of the previous two films then I'd recommend this for at least one viewing, it is slightly better than the second movie but still not on par with the original.

A few too many bad jokes.The actors aren't as intense as they need to be, the effects aren't plentiful enough (they actually made a winner out of the previous Chucky part 2), and as a result of these detractors, the movie is boring and slow. It's just too tough to take. And who would have figured? There was a lot of potential with the settings of the story. A military school and an amusement park are great places to take the show.

Here in the states, the VHS is out of print and it has never been released on DVD, and the movie itself is constantly plagued by negative reviews. Why? What were you expecting, 'Hamlet?' 'Child's Play 3' delivers exactly what you would expect from a movie like this. It's a post 80's horror sequel that follows Chucky on a military school campus. Chucky is through stalking Andy (our poor little underage victim from the previous films, now turned into a mopey teenager played by Justin Whalin), and has set his sights on a new naive child by the name of Tyler. I think I must be the only one who favors the military setting. It made for some great murders (Love the paintball gag) and gave the series a break from the norm. The movie is really short and caps off at a carnival, once again, another great setting where Chucky wreaks havoc nearby exposed, industrial sized fans and a giant Grim-reaper, swinging a giant *real* blade (I wonder how far that park got before it was shut down). The movie is obviously pretty unrealistic, but that doesn't matter. That's not why we watch these movies. A lot of people complain about this movie, but I just don't see what's wrong with it.

Chucky greets Andy who is now 16 years old, to tell him that he is old news and is after 'fresh new meat' and so the chase is on to stop Chucky.Justin Whalin does almost resemble Alex Vincent from the earlier movies in physical appearance but I am sorry to say that his acting abilities are stiff like the corpses that Chucky lives behind. The rest of the cast are o.k., the special effects are the same, there is some humour, and it is very violent that is why it is giving an R rating but the story is getting thin by singing the same old song of Chucky marching quickly in meeting the Grim Reaper at the end of the film, again!!!This third installment of the Chucky adventures is needless and must be given far more consideration of a better plot.

Play Pals Toy Company decides to re-release its Good Guys line, feeling that after all this time, the bad publicity has died down. As they re-used old materials, the spirit of Charles Lee Ray once again comes to life. In his search for Andy, Chucky falls into the hands of a younger boy, and he realizes that it may be easier to transfer his soul into this unsuspecting child. Andy is the only one who knows what Chucky is up to, and it's now up to him to put a stop to it.When I was a wee lil' boy back in the early 90's, I managed to hold out on seeing this movie till I had seen number 2 since the video store screwed up and still had Child's Play 2 as an overnight and had Child's Play 3 as a weekly rental (I refused to pay those expensive prices to have a movie for just 1 day).I felt that this movie was good FOR a Chucky film but if this movie was an original and the other 2 hadn't existed, this would probably have left me feeling somewhat disappointed. It was a standard sequel that had no great story to it, basically has a known horror character doing what he does best...kill, kill, kill! Chucky at a military school? Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it? At least it's not as dull as the plots to Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels.There were some nice moments in the film though, once again with Chucky making smart-ass comments after/before he disposes of his victims. I think the casting could have been much better. From what I can tell, Alex Vincent who played Andy Barclay and Child's Play 1 and 2 has different coloured eyes to Justin Whalin who plays Andy Barclay in Child's Play 3. It's not exactly something you'd notice though unless you were a hardcore fan to the bone.There are some moments that have an opportunity to make you jump, it all depends on how much attention you are paying to the movie though. If you get bored quickly from the movie you probably won't be able to give all of your attention to the film but there is quite a lot of Chucky action at the beginning that gets you straight into the entertaining parts.Overall, Child's Play 3 is quite watchable but you'd wanna keep to Child's Play 1 and 2 because they are much better. Still, I'm a Chucky fan so my score is somewhat biased but anyone who's a Chucky fan or even a slasher fan may find some merit in this movie.

"},{"Title":"Tired sequel **spoilers**","Date":"5 November 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Child's Play 3 is yet another tired horror sequel. Produced immediately after the release of its immediate predecessor, it is well made on a technical level, but the material is wearing thin. The story gets off to a good start; many years after the previous films, the toy company plans to put the Chucky doll back into production, deciding that all the negative publicity surrounding the unexplained deaths has passed. Chucky himself is resurrected in a new (but identical) body, and after dispatching the company president, tracks down little Andy, who is now a troubled teen in a military school. So far so good, but the writers have little idea where to go after setting up the story, which descends into the usual tedious business. Even the novelty of the setting doesn't really help. The opening credits are stylish, but we need a little more than that for plot.Justin Whalin is admittedly credible in the role of the grown Andy, and offers what is probably a reasonably accurate portrait of how the character would have changed in eight to ten years. The filmmakers could have made a worse movie by giving us an stereotypical annoying teen character in the lead, but they managed to avoid that problem at least. Travis Fine's character is, however, the most hateful in the entire movie. I realize there's a jerk in every military setting, but this is one guy who deserves to be killed off early on, so that we may be spared his immature antics. Brad Dourif lends his squeaky voice to the killer doll once more, though I wonder if he was getting tired of the routine by this point. Andrew Robinson is wasted as a mean-spirited barber.After an interminable period of uninspired kills, the film climaxes at an nearby amusement park. This portion of the film is incredibly contrived. First of all, I doubt that such a place would be located anywhere a military establishment. Even if I am wrong on this, the whole thing still feels tacked on. There is no creative reason why such a setting is necessary. It is painfully clear that the writers were fumbling for ideas and simply picked something at random. Perhaps someone involved in the production was a fan of Tobe Hooper's Funhouse. At the very least, Child's Play 3 does not hint at the possibility of a sequel; though one was eventually produced years later, that is another review altogether.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures "},{"Title":"Better than the others","Date":"28 October 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  This film isn't exactly the top of all horror movies, but it's more enjoyable than the others.

Obviously, in the third film about a murderous doll, you don't expect much in the way of plot. But, GOD, the scares are cheaper than my younger brother.  As other reviewers have said, it's kinda hard to be scared of Chucky, given his height.  All of the murders (except, perhaps, the one in the garbage truck, though that was stupid and pointless) were telegraphed a half hour in advance.  None of the humans really develop any personalities, though I enjoy Andrew Robinson (Scorpio in Dirty Harry) as the insane barber who dies trying to give the Chuckster a trim.Also, this film was made in 1991, but took place eight years after CP2? (made in 1990)  Please!The main attraction, of course, is Chucky himself.  Again voiced by Brad Douriff (whatever happened to him?  He used to be a great, respectable actor see One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), but now, he's pretty much confined to crappy sci-fi.  Still, he gives it his all (why is my question), and Chucky does a decent job of making the film watchable.  The scene where Col. Cochrane (Dakin Matthews) dies of a heart attack while Chucky attacks him, and most of Chucky's dialogue, are a real scream.

Chucky introduces himself to Tyler and tries to transfer his soul.It's a mistake to jump ahead in time to a teenager Andy. The iconic character is Chucky but the other character should be a child Andy. Half of the tension in the first two movies comes from the fact that nobody believes the little kid. This movie is stupider and has none of the tension. The whole military school isn't any fun and the idea of family is completely gone. Tyler is written like an idiot. The movie is pretty bad. This is a darker movie but not necessarily any better for it. Chucky is a bit more funnier with the verbal jabs. That is probably the only good to come from this movie. "}{"Title":"Presto Your Dead! The Darkest and Most Violent Chucky Film","Date":"17 May 2012","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" I truly believe that Child's Play 3 is the last REALLY great Chucky film in the series as Bride and Seed don't ultimately work for me that much. Even though the this film was released less than a year after it's predecessor, I still think it holds up well, and I disagree with the creators of the franchise that it is the least best of the Chucky films. I personally thought this was a much better take on than Bride and See because it still stood the test at being scary. Even though, there are a slight few problems with this sequel, I still like it for what it is.This film is supposedly set several years after the first two Child's Play films and focuses on Andy Barclay (now being played by Justin Whalin), going to a military school which is full of meat heads and gives the ol' grueling drills. Andy definitely does not fit in straight away. On the other side of the story, the Good Guy Doll factory after being a dead site is revived where the melted Chucky from the last film is remade by the hot melting plastic. Chucky comes back to life again, in a new body and kills off the toy maker's owner Mr. Sullivian. He then finds the location of Andy, and mails himself to the military site, where instead of going after Andy, he goes after Tyler. Andy seems to know everything while the others have no knowledge about what's going happening.I believe Child's Play 3 is another excellent entry in the killer doll franchise, and it's very underrated for a killer doll film.Starting off with some positives, I like the entire concept where Andy doesn't only have to face his fears of Chucky again, but he also has to deal with the nasty military school peers who bully and give him a hard time during the process. At first, I also thought that the military site and later on the carnival rides was a bit too the extreme but now I think it is pulled off well.The music score (although varying and different in tone and style) I feel worked quite well.Justin Whalin surprinsgly does a good job as Andy, where I felt sympathy for him. He truly brought the character back to prime source. Sure, he's no Alex Vincent, but he did well with what he was given. The others actors such as Travis fine, perry Reeves and Andrew Robinson were good in their roles.Once again, the entire credit goes to Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky, where he brings a dark sense of humor to him. He gives him a stalkerish, creepy personality where the doll is more nastier, more brutllaer and definitely mean spirited at best. The look of Chucky once again gets a plus because I like how they kept up with the times, to see what Good Guy Dolls would look like several years later. Chucky is more scary looking in this one.The kills like the 2nd film were also done at an excellent pace.There were a few problems to put out, but there aren't too many as I do like this sequel.1 The actor playing Tyler was awful. Really the worse actor in the film. He was definitely not convincing as a scared little boy and all he did was yell, be happy or just be silly. I'm not really sure how I took this, he was just horrible in this film.2 Once again, this film can not reach the impact or tension of the original. Like the film before it, it just seems to be some slasher fun which is dark and nasty. That's all.That's really the only problems I had with this film. I do think Child's Play 3 is a sequel that nearly works on the same level as Child's Play 2 did. I do like it.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Child's Play 3","Date":"25 February 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Child's Play 3 apparently takes place eight years after the events that occurred in the toy factory of part two.

Hence, Child's Play 3 was released in August 1991, less than one year after Child's Play 2 was released in October 1990. Mancini has called it his least favourite because he felt he was out of ideas so soon after part 2. The time line between this movie and the sequel Bride of Chucky takes place in the same year, yet impossible. Andy turned six in November, and he is sixteen in this movie. Bride of Chucky would need to take place at least a month or so (possibly in December) of 1998. A prologue to the film was initially written featuring a pair of siblings, Joey and Pam, who break into the abandoned Good Guy Factory. The sequence would've made for lots of creepy visuals and explain how the doll making machine turns on by itself. In the script Pam finds Chucky's remains and part of his head snaps vigorously at her fingertips. She falls backwards onto a lever, activating the machine. The two children scamper off. Jason Ritter (son of actor John Ritter who would later appear in Bride of Chucky) was initially cast to play the character of Joey. At the last minute Universal opted not to film the prologue.The film was filmed at historic Kemper Military School (now closed).

Child's Play 3 is a prime example of 90's horror movie film-making and exactly why it all felt so tired. From 1991 to about 1996 we had nothing of really any worth in the genre (Although it was still preferable to today, when everything is a remake) and for the most part this franchise had lost all of it's steam.

The film really is a treat for fans. BRAD DOURIF reprises the role of the villainous Chucky (His voice) & is always fun to watch, since he really makes the character. In another actors hands, I highly doubt Chucky would ever have had the success he's had in horror filmdom. JACK BENDER does fairly well behind the camera. Like the two directors before him, he not only milks out as many suspenseful & tense filled moments as he can for maximum impact, but also brings wicked sense of style to the film that is all his own. The acting is fairly reasonable for the most part, with JUSTIN WHALIN really standing out as Andy.While ANDREW ROBINSON is a hoot as the military school's barber. What should be noted, is how the film-makers yet again take the same route, the makers of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET took with the later entries in that series, by making Chucky an almost Freddy Kruger like character, as he spews a series of bad (but funny) puns as he dispatches his victims. Many of the deaths are on the creative side & the Chucky doll is brought wonderfully to life. DON MANCNI returns to pen the script & despite his claims that it's his least favourite entry in the series, I highly disagree, CHILD'S PLAY 3 is a lot more fresh & inventive than most horror sequels (It's much better than the tepid SEED OF CHUCKY which Mancini directed) it has a very well drawn out story, interesting characters & a fresh inventive take on the storyline. The film has many moments to rival the first two films scares & actually shares a few things in common with the first, the return of the winter weather setting, the young boy who sees an advertisement for the Good Guy Dolls, during one of the cartoons based on the toy & is overwhelmed by it saying wow which is the same cartoon & Andy's same reaction from the first film. The film has a few light sprinkles of comedy, but for the most part, it's a straight laced horror film. Andy also carries with him the photo of he & his mother (in colour this time, since part 2 has the same photo but in black & white).On the downside, the film does have some problems. Released a mere nine months after the second film, CHILD'S PLAY 3 not only has the distinction of being one of the quickest arriving sequels in film history, but also suffers from some plot questions that never do get answered like Who wrapped Chucky up to send him to Andy at the Military School? Whatever became of Kyle from Part 2? Chucky removing the paint balls from the guns in order to insert real bullets, also asks one to accept a lot, since it begs the question Why would the army not check the guns to make sure they were paint balls & not real bullets? Surely they would have checked on this before allowing the cadets to use the guns? Despite being young, surely Tyler would have wondered why a walking, talking doll would want to play games with him & ask him to keep his existence a secret, since the doll would have to be pretty hi-tech to be walking & talking like Chucky does. How is it that the character of Whitehurst is the only one to see a grenade dropping by the troops during the forest scene towards the end of the picture? Since there were dozens present when Chucky was around, surely they wouldn't have taken their eyes off a walking, talking killer doll, to watch Andy & one of the leaders have a brief scrap. Also if destroying Chucky's heart was the way to kill him (according to the first) why is he still walking around? why if Andy knows this is a way to kill Chucky off, does he never attempt to destroy his heart? the destroying Chucky's heart angle was never played up again for the rest of the films that followed Part 1. Also if Chucky's blood, which can be seen pouring out all over the liquid plastic in the long abandon good guy doll plant, caused him to come back, wouldn't this also create an army of Chucky's? Since the blood would be in every doll that was made with that batch of liquid? Speaking of the liquid, why would the factory use old mixture & not use a new batch? None of these questions are ever answered.All in all, despite it's bad rap, CHILD'S PLAY 3 is nowhere near as bad as some fans of the series are claiming, in fact I rather enjoyed the film as a whole. It's a really fun entry in the series & closes off the Andy Barclay trilogy storyline quiet nicely. Not only that, but the title would never be used again for the next three entries, which are billed as CHUCKY movies. There's suspense, there's tension, there's atmosphere, a few nifty kills, good acting, directing, fun characters, so what's not to like? Highly recommended. After this films dismal performance at the box office, Chucky would take a much longer commercial hibernation from the screens, before re-emerging for the rather fun, BRIDE OF CHUCKY. ***1/2 stars "},{"Title":"Not Another One!","Date":"14 October 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Man, when are they going to give up on these movies?

Childs Play 3 is the obvious third installment to the doll killer franchise and its undoubtedly the worst to come. Its a poorly acted, odd Horror film that you consider yourself lucky to see because of the awful darkness of the movie itself. Screenwriter Don Mancini confessed to completely and totally running out of ideas for the series which is no doubt why after this one there was a seven year gap until Bride of Chucky, and then a six year gap until Seed of Chucky was made. Seems like ideas for killer dolls that need to find a human soul were hard to come by.This is a weird one to explain, The Good Guy Doll Factory has reopened and reassembled Chucky which still has the soul of Charles Lee Ray in the doll. Andy is now 16 and has been shipped off to Military School and apparently has been in more foster homes then just the Simpsons', and has failed in all of them. Ronald Tyler, a younger recruit takes the Chucky doll to Andy, but in a failed attempt to get possessed, goes on a killing spree again to find Andy and try to transfer his soul. Its the same movie in a different environment, but just unrealistically stupid.What bothers me is two things. One, its so dark in this carnival, military camp, trying to see whats going on is harder than understanding it. Most of the time, Im clueless and just assuming what is happening. Another thing, is we get no mention to what happens to Kyle (Andy's foster sister in CP2). We get zero information. At least in the second one they say that the mother is in psychiatric therapy. So overall, this is shockingly the worst Horror film I've ever seen. There's no adrenaline pumping scenes, and everything is just dark (quite literally). This still amazes me that a franchise can go from excellent to awful in just three movies. If a franchise makes it the third film they should put a lot of effort into it, not just throw some back ass movie together with almost no sense made. Maybe around 1991 they were learning movie sequels attract a lot of money no matter the plot. At very least we get Brad Dourif's excellent voice talents.Starring Justin Whalin, Perrey Reeves, Jeremy Sylvers, Peter Haskell, Dakin Matthews, Travis Fine, Dean Jacobson, and Brad Dourif.

Andy get's a trim, meets a nerd who's always bullied named Whitehearst, befriends a young private named Tyler and even meets his drill instructor Lt. Colonel Shelton! Shelton treats everyone like scum. Andy also meets DeSilva, a feisty female who thinks Shelton is a major dick.           One afternoon, a package arrives for Andy and Tyler is told to take it to him. But curiosity got to Tyler. He opened the packageand met Chucky! Chucky chooses Tyler's body for his soul's new home. The body count grows as well. They include Colonel Cochrane, a garbage truck driver, and the barber. Tyler ignores Andy's warnings about Chucky. Soon it's time for the war games. But Chucky unloads the paint bullets and put's in live rounds so the war games are no longer games. Chucky and Tyler run into an amusement park. Andy and DeSilvafollow. In the housing for a big roller coaster, Chucky tries to transfer his soul into Tyler, but Andy, who's mastered a gun, manages to blow off Chucky's arm, then blows Chucky into the blades of a giant fan. Chucky was completely shredded to pieces!! They lived happily ever after. I suppose.         Now for my commentary. When Andy is being interviewed by Coloen Cochrane, he exclaimed his mom was under psychiatric treatment. For eight years? Couldn't they have already found something wrong with her? Nothing was wrong so why are they keeping her? And whathappened to Kyle? The girl who was with Andy in Child's Play 2? Andy didn't mention her in this movie? They also said at the beginning at the board meeting that the doll they just built and were giving to Mr. Sullivan was the first Good Guy of the '90s. Well what about in the factory scene in Child's Play 2? There were acres and acres of Good Guy dolls and boxes. What happened to them?! So this film forgets about the details of the first two. This was also the worst in the series. If you saw 1 and 2, just go right to Bride of Chucky. Don't bother with this one. --  "},{"Title":"I was an extra in C.P. 3","Date":"19 March 2005","Score":"11 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" In 1991 I was an unfortunate attendee of a crap military school, the now defunct Kemper Military School, in Boonville, Missouri. Somehow I managed to have good enough grades to be included in the extras cast, and I am prominently visible in 3 scenes. Wow, did this movie suck, buy what else did you expect? It was, to say the least, a bizarre experience. To have all of these L.A. types dropped into the middle of B.F.E. We had quite a few laughs at their expense, for some reason a large number of the crew bought fur caps (why?!?!) in Columbia and wore them during the filming, which was in the winter. We identified them as such, Brown Fox Man, Field Mouse Man, Roadkill Beaver Man, etc. Considering the absolute hell-hole conditions we had endured at this school, this all came as some desperately needed comic relief.The best part, the catering. I had lost roughly 15 lbs during the school year, and when they let the extras eat with the crew, we were overjoyed, I mean I can still taste the steak kabobs!I haven't really been in touch with anyone from the school since I left after that one horrible year, which makes viewing the movie now all the more surreal, like a bad dream from a previous life. Not that I've seen it recently, I wouldn't spend my money on this piece of s#*t. One note, I met the author, a Mr. Mancini, and I have to say he was a cool dude.

It continues the tale of the killer doll ('Chucky') who's possessed by the soul of a serial killer blah, blah, blah and is still hunting down the only person who he can transfer his soul into. However, his 'soul's desire' is no longer a young boy, but a teenager at military school. This basically gives the film its setting for the next ninety minutes.No, Part 3 is not really as good as parts 1 and 2. Even the writer admits to feeling 'rushed' into doing as sequel so quick off the back of part 2. However, it's not as bad as it could be. There's nothing amazingly original here &#x96; Chucky kills, no one believes that the doll's real until it's too late and so on. Like Part 2, everyone who's in any way nasty (mainly adults) meet a sticky end, leaving you to almost feel that Chucky is doing the world a favour by getting rid of them.But there are some nice set pieces among the obligatory 'teen romance' sub plot, so, like I said, if you liked the first two, you'll probably enjoy this one &#x96; just don't raise your hopes too high.Also, it's worth noting that Part 3 is the last Child's Play/Chucky film to 'play it straight.' After this one, the franchise took a 'less serious' tone.

If they'd taken the time to actually watch the thing&#x97;which is unlikely&#x97;they would have realised just how ridiculous their campaign against the film really was this predictable third outing for Chucky, the toy doll possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer, is harmless, formulaic popcorn nonsense, far less deviant than the press would have had us believe, and&#x97;being fantasy-based rather than grounded in reality&#x97;even less likely to corrupt.

Chucky suddenly is more busy delivering puns than killing people and the movie is definitely paying less attention to its horror elements, especially when compared to the first two movies. You therefore also really shouldn't watch this movie expecting a lot of tension, scares, gore or other typical horror elements.But that's not necessarily a complaint of course. I mean, if the movie is fun to watch then it shouldn't really have mattered that the movie isn't much great as an horror. But the movie just isn't all that fun or great to watch, since it's such a simple written one, in which the story doesn't even make sense in the first place.I don't get it. It's already established early on in the movie that Chucky doesn't need Andy anymore to regain an human form but yet he keeps going after him. Why go through all the trouble Chuck? I though it was also weird that he picked a new kid for his soul to transfer to, while in the first movie he was complaining about it that he had to transfer his soul into little Andy if he ever wanted to be human again. He now had the chance to literally pick anybody he wanted but instead he went for a stupid (literally, this kid is just stupid), whiny little kid again. What's the deal with that?There really is no reason for Andy to be in this movie again. Guess they thought it would help the series forward by featuring an 16-year old Andy this time but they should have known that the series was never about its human characters but the good guy doll Chucky instead. It also never feels like this is the same Andy as from the first two movies. In this movie, 8 years had passed since the last encounter with Chucky, so Andy had grown and looked and acted nothing like the little kid that he once was. It of course also doesn't help that he is being played by a completely different actor this time. No, it was a bad and totally unnecessary move to have Andy in this movie again. I imaging it was probably due to it that the movie went through numerous re-writes, which really messed things up.It feels like such an uninspired movie, as if they weren't even trying to come up with something good or original, as long as it would be making some money. It's not an horrible movie but I can totally understand why this is a much hated movie, by especially the fans of the Child's Play-series.It's a sequel you can easily skip on.5/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Not Great, Not Terrible","Date":"5 August 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Spoiler Alert I see a lot of readers either love or hate Child's Play 3. I think the movie is somewhere in the middle of that. First off, it came out only 9 months after part 2 (way to fast, come on, make the people want it more) like when Nightmare on Elm St.5 came out less then a year after 4 and that movie pretty much sucked. whenever you rush out a new movie for the money, it's not gonna be as good. Also when it came out (1991) Horror was already starting to cool down (till 1996's Scream). As far as the actual movie, well if you liked part 1 and 2 then I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. It takes place 8 years after part 2, which was a good idea because we didn't need to see Chucky chasing Andy as a kid again. So Andy is now a teen and going to a Millatary School. Mean while the Play Pal Company Decides to start reselling the Good Guy Dolls (guess they didn't learn after part 1 and 2, and I guess they didn't notice a big mess of Chucky with no head and Blood coming out from part 2 before they started remaking the dolls....how would his blood not be dried up by then??? It's only been 8 years lol). So Chucky's Blood spills into the new batch of Plastic and boom he's back to life. He finds out the School where Andy is at and thus mails himself there (no comment). This little kid Tyler (who befriended Andy early on) ends up with the box and opens it (tampering with mail is a federal offense Chucky tells him) but, he decides Tyler would be a perfect new body for him to transfer his soul into. Eventually Andy finds out he's there, He trys to save Tyler from Chucky, you got plenty of side characters as well whiteherst (the nerd), Lt. Sheldon (the prick), The Funny as hell Barber (forget his name but he's great in Hellraiser as well) and I can't remember the chicks name but there's a whole lovey dovey side plot with her and Andy (zzzz), anyway, People get killed, Chucky laughs a lot. And then there's a big ending at a Carnival. This one almost foreshadowed what the series would become with large doses of comedy and one liners from Chucky. The movie had some OK kills (I don't know why everyone says how gory this movie is....movies like Brain Damage (Dead Alive), Dawn/Day of The Dead, Evil Dead, etc., now THOSE are gory movies). So overall, I think this is a decent little movie that most horror fans would at least like, especially if your a fan of the series.

As film watchers the thing we have to really look at is the quality of the film, which is tougher with sequels, especially to classic horror films. Many sequels are made solely for profit and often times are not only inferior compared to their predecessor, but as films in general. Often times they lack heart. Such is the case with many of the 'Children of the Corn' and 'Hellraiser' sequels that have come in recent years. One thing that can really hurt a sequel's chance of being any good is if it's rushed. That's what happened with the third 'Child' s Play' film, which came out less than a year after 2. But surprise, surprise it's far better than expected. In fact, in my worthless opinion it's the best of the first three films and rare example of a rush job done well. What are the odds? Pros Performances are good all around. The military school makes a great new setting. Cool opening titles sequences. Fast pace. As with the first two the effects are top-notch. A decent score. Some good kills. A good sense of humor. Great finale.Cons Not much plot. Totally lacking in scare and suspense. Some plot holes.Final thoughts After a good, but not great second film the series steps up a bit and becomes a really fun horror franchise. Sure this one is devoid of scares, but it more than makes up for that.

When 'Good Guy' dolls go back into production, the manager never thought re-using old materials would cause such a fuss -- and a truckload of corpses. For the materials used contain (drumroll, please).....the spirit of long-thought-dead serial killer Charles Lee Ray!!

THAT. EFFORT.), Chucky is a little p***ed off to find that the once sweet and innocent young kid that loved him so has gotten older and therefore useless. Chucky discovers a new, younger child to possess and sets about doing this, randomly offing some other folk along the way. But Andy is well on his way to halting Chucky and takes the necessary steps to ending the little dolls reign of terror once and for all...See, I think I summed up my overall feel of the film in the last line. I understand that, in this post-modern ironic oh-aren't-we-sooo-funny society, slasher movies are supposed to contain characters that are intelligent and knowing, but bite the big one all the same. And we are therefore supposed to look back at the other stalk 'n' slash movies of yore with distaste and bemusement at the apparent lack of 'post-modernism' the characters have. But for crying out loud -- HE'S A DOLL!! Chucky is wonderfully cunning and evil and dangerous et al, but how can you be convincingly scary when you stand at a height even a vertically-challenged pygmy named 'Shortarse' would laugh at? It's like, c'mon man - get some stilts, would ya? The characters in this film all have their deaths prearranged by being so stupid and,  although I hate to admit it, this happens to make up quite a lot of the enjoyment of the film.It's a highly likeable picture, with a strong main character and imaginative death-scenes that passes the time with ease. I suggest a night in with your buddies and get this for a bit of a scare, Fast Times At Ridgemont High or Mallrats for a laugh and The  Goonies for a bit of nostalgia.

Basically the Play Pals Inc. factory has been shut down for the last eight years, due to the bad publicity surrounding the events of the supposed killer doll, but they are reigniting the business. In the process of clearing up the mess left behind, the remains of dead Chucky the doll, possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) (named after Charles Mason, Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray) are picked up, and the blood drips into the wax that will make the new line of Good Guy Dolls. Of course Chucky is the first doll to come off the line, and reawakened he immediately murders Pal Pals Inc. CEO, Sullivan (Peter Haskell), before locating now sixteen year old Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) who has been enrolled at a military school. Andy being the new recruit is immediately despised by Cadet Lt. Col. Brett C. Shelton (Travis Fine), who loves to bully all the cadets, also including Harold Aubrey Whitehurst (Dean Jacobson) and Kristen De Silva (Escape to Witch Mountain's Perrey Reeves). Andy has been sent a package, and young cadet Ronald Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers), who has seen the recent commercial for them, is excited to see from a rip made that it is a Good Guy Doll, Chucky comes to life and instead of going to look for Andy realises that he can possess the first person he reveals his identity to, so he tells Tyler. Andy is worried that something bad is going on as one or two people on the base die is mysterious circumstances, and soon enough Chucky comes out to reveal himself alive again, and the young man realises his new plan to possess Tyler. Chucky goes from place to place and murders more and more people, including the school's commandant Col. Cochrane (Bean's Dakin Matthews) and military barber Maj. Botnick (Hellraiser's Andrew Robinson), in the process of trying to pass his soul into the new body. Andy tries to convince Tyler that Chucky is evil, but he does not listen, and Whitehurst sees the doll come to life too, but he refuses to help the situation, fearing the consequences. The base all prepare to go on a war games (military simulation) exercise, split into two teams, red and blue, where they will try and get the other team's flag, using rifles filled with paint bullets, of course the red team's rifles have been filled by Chucky with live rounds. During the night Tyler and Chucky are reunited, and the little boy realises that the doll is indeed bad, and after all the live rounds have killed a few people he escapes and makes his way towards the near carnival fairground. Andy and De Silva follow Tyler and Chucky this way, and all end up inside the carnival haunted house ride as the doll tries to catch the little boy and transfer his soul into his body, having his face sliced off by a Grim Reaper statue's moving scythe. Chucky is stopped from completing his incantation to transfer his soul into Tyler's body, and Andy shoots his arm and cuts his hand off, before he is thrown off the edge and is sliced to pieces by the spinning blades of the large fan below, his remains scattered, the last thing we see is De Silva taken away in an ambulance and Andy taken away in a police car. Also starring Burke Byrnes as Sgt. Clark, Matthew Walker as Sgt. Ellis and Donna Eskra as Ivers. Whalin is a pretty dull and silly replacement for original cute victim Alex Vincent, the rest of the cast are no better, and not even the slightly less good puppet effects and menacing and wisecracking voice of Dourif can save it. The story being set in a military school is a bit ridiculous, the concept is exactly the same as the other two, you are no longer shocked or surprised by the deaths when they happen, this is definitely the worst of the films in the series, also because of the controversial tabloid frenzy it caused. In 1993, in Britain, two year old James Bulger was kidnapped, abused, tortured and murdered by ten year old Jon Venables and ten year old Robert Thompson, and there were reports that claimed that they may have watched Child's Play 3 and been influenced by a scene or two to commit the horrific crime. This claim was dismissed by the police as being false, and neither of the boys would have watched the video, it just happened to be at the house of Venables's father who had rented it, but the boy was not living there at the time it was rented. Never the less, this film is even more disliked in Britain because of these claims and reports, and overall, it is a really terrible horror sequel. Pretty poor!

The acting is hammy, with no exception(well, possibly Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky... but that almost doesn't count, since he's always good anyway). The characters are daftly written clich√©s and stereotypes. The dialog is unforgivably bad. The death scenes are slower, less detailed and generally less interesting and cool than the first two. Yes, this film is bad, very bad. But surprisingly, it's not completely intolerable. I found myself actually enjoying several parts of it. I think the main thing making this bad is that it's basically the story of the first; a kid gets a talking doll, it tells him that it's in reality a psychopathic killer, and he stays close to it, despite people around him dying. There are a few alterations to the formula, but they really don't change the fact that this is almost a remake of the first. The changes are that this time, the kid isn't Andy, the kid is slower at figuring out that Chucky is bad and it takes place at a military school. What really bothered me is that there's almost no tie-in with the first two films whatsoever. In the first scene, we get a quick summary of what happened in the first film, told by someone who has no idea what really happened, and then at one point, we see a picture of Andy as a child and his mother. No mention of Kyle, no real justification for him being at the military school. Also, why does Play Pal keep reconstructing Chucky? More importantly, how the heck does Chucky manage to mail himself complete in a Good Guy box to the military school? The film has so many shortcomings, yet I couldn't help but enjoy it to an extent. Some parts of it were actually slightly good. I liked the twist of Chucky chasing someone other than Andy for once. I will say that the Full Metal Jacket spoof was painful, though. If Kubrick wasn't alive when this was made, he would have turned in his grave. The end of this one isn't as overdone as the first two, which I found good(but some may be disappointed). All in all, this is probably the worst Chucky film, but it's not as bad as some say. Note that my rating is below average, but only slightly. I recommend this to fans of the Child's Play series and horror fans... be warned that this is the lesser film of the series, though. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Horrible","Date":"22 May 2002","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Child's Play 3 has to be one of the worst attempts to a horror movie I've ever seen.  The acting was OK, but so many plot holes screwed this movie to death.  The whole story was stupid, one scene of realism, and all bad.  I wouldn't recommend this movie if I was paid to.  The deaths took to long and they were stupid.  Now why would an army man want to cut a doll's hair? Why would a carnival be right next to a military school with grenades and guns? It's stuff like that that screws this up.Overall I hated this movie and would never see this again.  Ever!  Rating 1 out of 10.

Here, Chucky returns to find Andy again, this time though, it is somehow 8 years later (though only 1 year after the last film) and Andy is a teen in a military camp, but now Chucky has a new target.  Some very effective chills (I think the line presto, your dead is classic in the barber scene) and another barf-bag climax (I don't think any other film has such decapitation of a kid's doll) bring this film to be not too bad, but of course, the sequel overkill almost makes this film not too good.  But it does have a good beginnign with visual quality.

When I laugh at a horror movie than scream, that can't be good. But I'm not sure why, it's still the same elements as the first two Child's Play films, but I think this one was more scary for the fact that Chucky was finally smart enough to just grab a gun, because it's more unbelievable when a two pound doll attacks a grown person and manages to win the battle. Also it had more gore in it and scary elements, so when it comes to this point, I'd have to say I've enjoyed this Child's Play movie the most so far. I heard Bride of Chucky is really good, so I'm looking forward to it, I just hope I'm not disappointed, I really miss my horror films.4/10 "},{"Title":"Child's Play 3","Date":"6 June 2009","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Don't f#ck with the Chuck.Sorry Jack, Chucky's back..again. The third film in the series regarding the psycho doll possessed with the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray needing a human host to exit from his plastic shell. After being resurrected from the doll factory via blood dripping from the damaged plastic(..Chucky's destruction in the previous film), Chucky kills the business executive who decided to start up the manufacturing of Good Guy toys, discovering that old nemesis Andy(Justin Whalin) is much older, shipped to a military school after spending time in multiple foster homes. Chucky finds another candidate in a young black boy, Tyler(Jeremy Sylvers) who Andy must protect, but this will be difficult because of Cadet Lt Col Brett C Shelton(Travis Fine), his commanding officer who makes life especially hard for new recruits. Shelton is simply a bullying thug allowed to treat certain cadets he doesn't like harshly, hiding behind his rank. Meanwhile, Chucky tricks Tyler into believing they're friends with Andy having to figure out ways to rescue him. Chucky, also, kills a few characters around the Kent military school for fun.There are essentially three acts to the film. The first act primarily consists of Andy's troubles adjusting to his new environment as Chucky roams around using his doll disguise as a means to startle victims before killing them. One victim, a garbage man hears Chucky's cries for help, hops into the truck's hopper to find him and is crushed inside(Chucky is able to escape quietly without the garbage man knowing) by the doll with no way to escape. Col Cochran(..the man in charge of the military school, who informs Andy that his place turns bed-wetters into men) actually has a heart attack when Chucky draws a hunting knife, not exactly a flattering way for such a decorated soldier's life to end. A third plans to give Chucky a hair cut(!)falling victim to a straight razor. The second act occurs in the woods near the school where a blue and red team, conducted of the cadets and their leaders, take part in a paint ball exercise with Chucky targeting Tyler(..red team)with Andy(..blue team, under Shelton's command, of course)having to abandon his team in order to save the kid. Chucky actually loaded the red team's rifles with actual rounds, resulting in an accidental murder, also threatening the life of Kristen(Perrey Reeves), Andy's love interest(..also part of blue team)with a grenade if Tyler(..who finally understands why Andy was warning him about Chucky)isn't handed over. A cadet gives his life when Chucky hurls his live grenade at the students. The third act involves the main principles, Andy and Kristen chasing after Chucky(..who has taken Tyler prisoner with a small gun found in the drawer of a security guard's desk)into a carnival outside the woods, with the climax taking place in a spooky funhouse ride.This film certainly was the low point in a series that seemed to digress in quality from one sequel to the next. Chucky tosses out lots of quips after murdering folks, which I admit to grinning at amusingly, but I found the overall film rather tiresome and the kills are relatively tame. The next two films, a far cry from the series which focused on Chucky terrorizing Andy, take a giant leap in terms of originality and casting. The casting in this film is rather colorless for the exception of Andrew Robinson as a military barber with a few screws loose(..who definitely has pride in his work)and Brad Dourif providing the enthusiastic voice of Chucky who thoroughly enjoys murdering people. I must admit that the use of a yo-yo to strangle a victim is rather unique. Dean Jacobson is cadet Whitehurst, an object of ridicule for Shelton who constantly berates him(..among others). Peter Haskell is Sullivan, the businessman who restarts the factory that led to Chucky's rebirth. Chucky's colorful language might earn giggles. "},{"Title":"Don't f*ck with the Chuck. I quite liked it actually.","Date":"26 February 2007","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Child's Play 3 starts as the Good Guy doll factory resumes production after several years of closure after the controversy surrounding young Andy Barclay & his tales of killer doll's. The company boss Mr. Sullivan (Peter Haskell) is presented with the first Good Guy doll straight off the production line, unfortunately what he doesn't know is that the doll is possessed by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) who calls himself Chucky. Chucky the doll comes to life, kills Sullivan & sets about finding the whereabouts of Andy (Justin Whalin) who has been sent to Kent military school to learn some discipline after rejecting several foster parents, Andy is Chucky's way out of the doll & posts himself to Andy but the parcel is opened by a young cadet named Tyler (Jeremy Sylvers) whom Chucky takes a liking to & decides to use his body instead of Andy's...Directed by Jack Bender I thought Child's Play 3 was a decent film & actually preferred it to the original Child's Play (1988). The script by Mr. Child's Play himself Don Mancini moves along at a fair pace & I never found myself losing interest, it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, the overall story is good & I liked the military academy setting. But that doesn't really matter because a Child's Play film is all about Chucky & his foul mouthed homicidal ways, the obscenity littered one-liners are present & correct & you see in Child' Play 3 that he is becoming the star of the series. The 'you gotta be f*ckin' kidding me' line as someone has a heart attack is hilarious the way he says it although whether you'll like this type of bad taste humour all depends on what you want from the series I suppose, you either want a straight horror film or a horror comedy & to be honest I think there's a good balance between the horror & the dark comedy. The character's are alright & the dialogue is fine but I thought there was a real lack of kills, I really wish Chucky had gotten to do more as he steals every scene he's in as it is & is the main reason why Child's Play 3 & the series as a whole is as watchable as it is.Director Bender doesn't do anything special, the film while well made is a bit flat & forgettable. The film tries to throw a few scars in here & there but mainly it's in-your-face type stuff as Chucky swears his way through the film, the special effects are pretty good even though there are one or two stiff looking puppet effects. The gore & violence levels are disappointing, there's a cool slit throat but very little else including a virtually bloodless scene when someone is blown up by a grenade, I mean if you were blown up with a grenade wouldn't there be lots of blood everywhere?Technically Child's Play 3 is good, it isn't going to win any awards but since it was produced by Universal studios it has a certain Hollywood polish to it. Released only 9 months after Child' Play 2 (1990) writer of all the Child's Play films Mancini has apparently said Child's Play 3 is his least favourite of the five. I have to mention the opening scene & credits which show Chucky being made because I think they're very cool & very effective. The acting is OK with Brad Dourif voicing Chucky obviously standing out.Child's Play 3 is a good little horror film that I liked more than I thought I would & I prefer it to the original by a fair margin despite it's lack of gore & kills. Followed by the fabulous Bride of Chucky (1998) & Seed of Chucky (2004).

The blood of Chucky accidentally leaks into the first doll off the assembly line and sure enough the killing machine is back. Andy, now a teenager, is at a military school and sure enough Chucky shows up looking for a body to rest his soul. This film is certainly a step up over the previous one due in large part to Chucky being a lot meaner than normal. There's nothing groundbreaking here but if you don't take the film too serious then it offers up some mild entertainment. There's no suspense but there are several very good death scenes including a great sequence where Chucky goes to the mean barber to do some cutting of his own. The ending takes part inside an amusement park ride and offers some fun as well. None of the performances are very memorable but they're no better or worse than what you'd normally get in a film like this. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of chucky and his performance is very good and steals the show. I'm not sure how he came up with that evil laugh but it's certainly priceless. The military school setting offers up some more nice laughs as we get the normal bully stuff with Andy being picked on by everyone in the school. "}]
