[{"Title":"The Riveting Mr. Ripley","Date":"6 March 2007","Score":"98 out of 107 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" I saw Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley and Clement's Purple Noon back to back. Two entirely different movies based on exactly the same book. The differences are personal of course. Minghella has a moralistic view of his characters and their darkness must be, somehow, explained if not justified. Clement's allows the amorality of his characters to run loose. Minghella casts Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, a rather invisible actor in every way and although he's pretty good here, he's not good enough to overshadow his rival Jude Law. Clement casts Alain Delon as Ripley and you will be with him all the way, you'll go where he goes you will turn out to be as amoral as he is - at least I did, I just wanted him to get away with it and why? Because he was Alain Delon, the Tom Ripley that, clearly, Patricia Highsmith intended. His rival is Maurice Ronet, good as he is, I didn't miss him when he left. You know why? Because I was left with the dangerous, magnetic, amoral, riveting Alain Delon. Clement allows us to see the difficulty and danger of the murders, we see them, we are there. Minghella plays it rather hurriedly. There is no real tension or horror. The most suspenseful moment is at an Opera house. The pluses on The Talented Mr Ripley - besides the aforementioned Jude Law - are Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett in two beautifully written and performed parts. In Purple Noon Marie Laforet is left rather to her own devices. Once all said and done you can watch both films as if they weren't even related. I prefer Purple Noon but that's just me.

Delon is perfectly cast, with his calculating cool. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes on the yacht---nothing gimmicky, but shot with an expertise that gives true drama to the action. You can feel the waves, the wind, and the sun. The colors are vibrant on the DVD. Though a scene like this in a typical movie today would include a heavy ominous score, the director simply lets the sound of the wind create the tension. The score (by Nina Rota), in fact, is understated, unlike anything today. Even the opening credits have style.

We get an extreme close-up of a woman who is kept out of focus while another character in the background, who is speaking and is in the center of the shot, remains in focus. Is the woman who is out of focus important or not? More to the point, was shooting it this way a good idea? It illustrates by contrast how sure-footed René Clément is most of the time. Usually there can be no debate.I wasn't familiar with Clément's work until this film, but my God, he's good. His camera is always in some unexpected place that enhances the drama and tightens the suspense. He shares that talent with Orson Welles (meaning the Welles of Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, not, say, Lady from Shanghai), who also made decisions that are surprising yet invariably right.Tom Ripley (Alain Delon) and Phillipe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) are lately inseparable friends. They're both idling in Europe, but on papa Greenleaf's dime. Phillipe's fiancée Marge (Marie Laforêt) feels sorry for Tom but resents his presence. Phillipe's other friend, Freddie (Billy Kearns), considers Tom Ripley a worthless moocher. But there's more to Tom Ripley, the mimic, the forger, the talented criminal improviser, than anyone, even Tom Ripley himself, can guess.Alain Delon, with his chiseled looks and cold beauty, makes an excellent Tom Ripley. The script is brilliantly adapted from Patricia Highsmith's terrific suspense novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley the dialogue is always bringing the themes of duplicity, love, self-love, the nature of identity, ruthlessness and murder to the surface where they are given a brilliant sheen by Clément and his cinematographer Henri Decaë. We're left to figure things out for ourselves, which is rare. Do we need to be told what Tom thinks of when he sees all those dead fish? When a door with a mirror swings open toward Tom, do we need to see Tom's mirror image to understand the mirror's significance? Or is it enough that we know there's a mirror next to Tom? I know what the answers would have been in Hollywood&#x97;in 1960 and now. Here, the answers are no, no and yes.

It was only when director Rene Clement tapped into the dangerous undercurrent held in reserve behind the placid, beautiful surface that Delon's wholly unique, dark, sociopathic persona would emerge--the persona which would put him on the map and he would forever be identified with.  In Plein Soleil AKA Purple Noon, Delon exudes all the stealth and sleekness of a panther--dark-haired, riveting gaze, smoldering, seductive and sinister. And like a panther, he proves himself to be just as lethal.  Delon stars as Tom Ripley, a pretty-but-poor young man who takes off to Rome as an errand boy to fetch the wayward Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet), and bring him back home to San Francisco to his impatient, rich father in exchange for $5000.  Not surprisingly, the spoiled, unsupervised Philippe doesn't want to return and give up his profligate, libertine lifestyle, and neither does Tom, when he gets a taste of how the other half lives.  And he soon determines he doesn't have to, when he concocts to take over Phillippe's money, his beautiful girlfriend Marge Duval (Marie Laforet), his identity. But of course, even in a perfect scheme devised by a cunning mind, one can't plan for everything and things eventually go south for our man Ripley.I haven't read the Patricia Highsmith book on which this is based, but I've seen the other film version of it, The Talented Mr. Ripley so I have only that to compare it with.  First the titles The latter one gets right to the point and is intriguing for that; the original has a certain romantic appeal, but is sinister behind the pretty sound of it--it portends of dark (purple) clouds (of evil) converging upon a bright sunlit horizon.  The latter film has outward homoerotic aspects that is very latent in this version (so much so that those expecting it to be overt will probably not notice--but it had to be given the era in which the movie was released), but it's there all right.  Tom is ostensibly supposed to covet Marge, but even when she's in a scene with him and Phillippe, the tension and electricity fairly crackles between the two intense young men, but not with her. Another difference, and I understand the latter version to be faithful to the book in this way, is Marge is not affluent, which rather puts her more in Tom's position as she is also at the mercy of Phillippe's money and volatile moods, and that lends another aspect to the film.  These differences I found negligible and didn't take away anything for either movie to me.However, I must say I found Delon's Ripley far more appealing than Matt Damon's one.  Not taking anything away from Mr. Damon as he is a capable actor and an attractive man, but he simply is not in Delon's league, either in the looks or magnetism department.  Damon really downplayed his pleasant looks for the role, and I really think that was a minus--he not only looks, but acts so unsettling that even a new born babe wouldn't take candy from this man.  Delon, on the other hand, is a much more refreshing villian and, strangely enough, more believable.  Refreshing because he's such a change from the usual villians that you would peg right from looking at them they're a heavy--they look unsavory (or at the very least not attractive). Believable because despite whatever sinister intentions Delon's Tom might emit, he's outwardly likeable and what's more, is so devastatingly handsome that it's easy to see how people would not take their instincts about such a person seriously and would let their guard down.  Ronet is fine in his portrayal as the not-so-nice rich boy Phillippe, but Laforet as Marie--to me she came across like an afterthought, she's bland and forgettable, but that's ok because the dynamics are between the two men, and later with how Tom handles his predicament.  This being said, I didn't care much for the pat crime-doesn't-pay finale in this one and thought the latter version far more satisfying in that respect.  Both are excellent movies in their own respective ways, I don't know if anyone can really say one vastly outdoes the other, but see this one  if you want to see Delon unleashed.P.S. Look for Romy Schneider, Delon's fiancee at the time, in the beginning of the movie as one of Phillippe's companions.  The beautiful, Austrian-born Ms. Schneider followed Delon back to France after she fell in love with him during the making of Christine.

Alain Delon is too good-looking to be dismissed as the geeky wannabee Matt Damon plays. His insanity in a pretty package is as unsettling as Gene Tierney's in Leave Her to Heaven. Delon looks like Maurice Ronet's brother, and you can see him wonder why if he's just as handsome as the other guy, why doesn't he have as much money? Ronet is more unpredictable than Jude Law as the whimsical rich boy and his death is every bit as shocking.I can't imagine that Anthony Minghella hadn't seen this version before making his own. He probably regrets Scorsese's reconstruction of Rene Clement's film so we can all make the comparison. Some scenes play like a shot-for-shot remake. Billy Kearns's brutal Freddy Miles is an obvious template for Philip Seymour Hoffman's more calculated and less powerful performance, and Gwyneth Paltrow's final breakdown is VERY close to that of Marie Laforet's.All through the 1999 film, I kept wondering why everybody couldn't see what was wrong with the toad-like Damon. In this one, Delon's plausible, even glamorous exterior made the success of his deceptions more understandable, and more frightening.

Cinematographer Henri Decae draws us into the film with its alluring Italian locales and gorgeous panoramic vistas. Bright, complementary hues and high color contrast translate into eye-popping reds and yellows. And, of course, there's the deep blue color of the sea, and a brilliant sunlit sky. Such is the setting for a story wherein three attractive, young adults (Tom, Philippe, and Marge) test a 3-way relationship that is far more complex than it first appears.Indeed, trouble lurks beneath the surface (so to speak), in this Italiano paradiso thriller. In the first forty minutes, the psychological motivations of our three beautiful people are unclear and subject to change. It's hard to tell who is doing what to whom. Subsequent to this narrative setup, we see exactly where the story is headed. Because Plein Soleil is a psychodrama, casting is important. The three leads (Alain Delon, Maurice Ronet, and Marie Laforet) are all convincing in their roles.I have not read the Highsmith novel on which the screenplay was based. So I cannot make an intertextual analysis. I do think this 1960 film is superior, for various reasons, to the more recent remake. Adroitly directed by Rene Clement, with a buoyant musical score by Nino Rota, Plein Soleil is a character study of an amoral pleasure seeker whose charming personality masks the evil within. The juxtaposition of inwardly criminal intent with outwardly idyllic scenes of Italy and the Mediterranean results is an art house film that is both picturesque and suspenseful. It's a film that appeals both to our eyes and to our brains.

(My birth date is 1950.) It was the first time when I saw the name and the image of Alain Delon on a movie poster. On the poster Delon was seen naked on the upper part of his body, directing a yacht's steering wheel. Years later I would read Highsmith's Talented Mr. Ripley and realize that, the screenplay of the movie had some fortunate differences from the book. One of these differences was the interesting dialog between Delon and Ronet on the latter's yacht just before the murder. This dialog which is written by the director Rene Clement (or his co-writer Paul Gogeoff), is, in my opinion, one of the finest, in all film history. Delon, tells Ronet, as a joke, about his plan to kill him and adopt his identity. Ronet enjoys the joke and criticizes the plan on its weak points. Delon logically answers all the criticisms Ronet has made. Ronet gradually realizes that the plan is too thoughtfully conceived and too minutely prepared. He begins to suspect that it may not be a joke. He gets nervous and then frightened, but only too late. Delon, suddenly initiating to materialize the plan, gets up and stabs Ronet with a knife. Ronet dies with a shock in his eyes. Delon throws away Ronet's body off the yacht into the sea. But he is unaware that he has failed to get rid of Ronet's body. At the final episode of the movie when the yacht is laid on the stocks, policemen(differently again from the book) find Ronet's moss covered body entangled with the propellers. In the film, Delon is caught by law whereas in the book, Ripley is not. After 40 years, all I remember of the film are the things which are absent (maybe missed) in the book. I also like the Highsmith's book and don't like the idea of changing books text just for the fancies of directors of cinema or stage. But Clement's (and Gogeoff's) script, I think, was full of creativity. I like Minghella's recent version of Talented Mr. Ripley much less than the Highsmith's book and Clement's film version of it. Minghella, seems to me, among many other things, especially missed Delon and the Fifties and the subtleties of Clement's script. After seeing the film and the fascinating personality of Delon as an actor, I had resolved that I would see any Delon film I would come across thereafter and did so.COSKUN BUKTEL "},{"Title":"Under the Sun, a film about the story of Mr Tom Ripley","Date":"20 September 2001","Score":"18 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Two stars of the French cinematography, Alain Delon and Maurice Ronet, combined their efforts in this excellent film, which showed good views of Rome and Italy in its first half.

Although other one was also good and more faithful to the novel, it dragged on a bit too much towards the end and Damon was just not a good choice for the leading role. Here we get to see Alain Delon, in his best days as actor and matinée idol.There are notable differences between this Ripley and the other one. He is not a homosexual here, so his murder of Phillippe Greenleaf is provoked solely by envy of his wealth and luxurious lifestyle, as well as the fact that he does what he wants and still gets away with it because he is the son of a bigshot. So this murder is cooler and more calculated than the one in the other film and the novel, I presume.I think that due to the time this film was made at, Ripley was turned into a heterosexual and thus his motif and personality differs somewhat from the original one. He also partly desires Greenleaf's sweet and forgiving girlfriend, Marge. The most interesting fact is that although Tom Ripley is a murderer and a crook, we still feel sympathy for him, or I do. The man he murdered was quite despicable and treated him like second class, an expendable thing, as he treated his women and in some way his own girlfriend. I believe Tom has a dislike for morally corrupt people and a sense of righteousness. His crime is therefore forgivable. He was a poor guy who wanted to get himself a piece of the cake and he did it.Delon is truly outstanding here. Other actors are solid, but he really shines. The last scene is the best and in some way both touching and sad, as we see Tom lying on the deckchair and drinking, blissfully unaware of what lurks around the corner. It is a magnificent touch by Rene Clement, a man whose work I have just started to get acquainted with and respect. Nino Rota's score enhances it all and makes this a true delight.

While Clement fails to provide much background as to why this character acts the way he does, Delon's photogenic countenance somewhat overcomes this void by masking it with personality and charm.

At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller, The Talented Mr. Ripley, first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the order-taking, money-holding, envious hanger-on to an over-bearing, arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler) The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

Ripley is a despicable character is many ways, but because its Delon playing him, this viewer was almost rooting for him to succeed and get way with his dastardly plan, its hard not to take to him as he sits astride a yacht, bronzed body, wind blowing in his hair like some Greek God returning to Olympus, its only his blood stained hands that blows this myth. The film is beautifully filmed, in stunning locations, the ever present brilliant sunshine being a perfect juxtaposition against the dark deeds taking place within. Its unusual to see Delon play a demure character, but he shows his range and he pulls it off in style because we know behind it all there is an amoral man (perhaps even insane) trying to get out. One scene that sticks out, is the aftermath of the crime on the yacht, as the sea suddenly swells and Ripley struggles to control the yacht and also cover up his deeds from the prying eyes of a nearby ship, its power is quite breathtaking, the danger for Delon must have been very real. Clement has crafted a slow burner of a thriller, the script being very thrifty and lean, the film being engrossing and full of life.

Masterful, is, for instance, the brief sequence where Ripley walks along the fish market, playing with the motive of guilt and justice without any pretention, almost unremarkable. But in first regard this enigmatism arises from the performance of Alain Delon, who gives the whole range between complete bewilderness, the incapacity of expressing himself, and the charme of an animal aware of his cruel instincts. And this almost without acting in the strongest sense of the word, only due to his appearance. "},{"Title":"Edgy, fast, well made, and simpler early version of Mr. Ripley","Date":"12 January 2011","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" Purple Noon (1960)It might be hard to see Purple Noon with the eyes of someone in 1960, when it was released, especially if you have seen the other famous movie based on the same book, the 1999 The Talented Mr. Ripley. But in fact they are rather different films, even though a few scenes are quite similar. The more loosely filmed, less elegant, and rather clumsier Purple Noon is admired for exactly those qualities. It is not the 1999 highly (highly!) polished, superbly acted Anthony Minghella movie by any stretch, and yet, in most views, it is the better movie.But not to me. It's worth avoiding too much of that which is better comparison by remembering that the early film is distinctive as it spends much of its time as a kind of elevated mind game between to very good looking young men. They spar, they taunt, they find a kind of liberty and discovery in the ways they push each other to be something unexpected, even dangerous. This is developed in quick snippets as we go, but you get the sense of it more fully in a couple of longer scenes, and then eventually on the beautiful yacht where the crisis from their derring do comes to a head. Once Tom Ripley takes full control of his destiny, and Mr. Greenleaf's, we see that he is not, actually, the brilliantly deceptive and disarming Mr. Ripley in Minghella's film. That is, he isn't the talented Mr. Ripley at all, but a young man who barely avoids catastrophe time after time in his plot to take over Greenleaf's identity. He does succeed, to a point, but the constant dodges and role playing of Matt Damon's character are less the point here. This is more the picture of someone in slightly over his head.Alain Delon is certainly a pretty boy actor, a kind of cleaner, and more French, James Dean (who was already 5 years dead by this point). I can see how people prefer his version of Tom Ripley, because it's more likable the way any pretty rebellious and slightly dangerous boy is likable. In a way, I admire Damon simply because he wasn't such a paradigm. His flaws showed. It's Jude Law in the later film who is the pretty boy, playing Mr. Greenleaf, and in the earlier French version we have Maurice Ronet, who at least has the advantage of looking a lot like Delon.There are some weird flaws in Purple Noon. One I couldn't accept at all was when Ripley calls Greenleaf's girlfriend, Marge, pretending to be Greenleaf, and Marge can't tell the difference. There are also touches in the later film that add to the complexity of it all--the addition of another woman, the greater presence of Freddy Miles (played in both movies by rather similar men), and the inner struggles of Ripley. Further, there is an authenticity to the American (later) film for the unavoidable reason that the characters are Americans in Europe, which they are (though Jude Law is British, a small point). In Purple Noon the characters are still American, with American names and histories and passports, but of course the look, act, and sound like they are French. Understandable, but odd in some larger view. There is also a wonderful sexual undercurrent in the later film missing in the first--the idea that Ripley is homosexual and doesn't know how to access those feelings, or how to come out to Greenleaf about it.Both films are beautifully filmed, this one far more simply, lacking the huge resources of Minghella's enterprise. That makes Purple Noon more gritty at times, and if it sometimes seems to cut corners (the market scene as the same woman in a blue dress in the background too many times), it is also more direct and less lofty, which is good in its own way. Jazz makes a brief appearance here, but nothing like in Minghella's version, where you might say the music takes over too much at times from the plot. Purple Noon does not, except for one short stretch on the yacht, dwell on atmospherics for their own sake.Rene Clement is certainly a celebrated French director, a generation before their amazing New Wave era. This is one of his lesser known features, but it has been getting closer attention in recent years, and you might really enjoy it. If you've seen the Damon/Law version of the two main characters here in action, you should enjoy the contrast of Delon/Ronet in the same roles. Very impressive, and different.

That's a pity because, even though this French movie hasn't stolen one iota of the love I have lavished upon Minghella's version over the years, it is a remarkable exercise in growing suspense and tension.The film opens in Italy, and Tom and Philippe (not Dickie) have been having fun together for some time now, squandering the money of Philippe's father, who hired Tom to take him back to the USA. The story opens clumsily and thrusts the viewer into the middle of the action without any preambles, unlike Minghella's version. Philippe is getting tired of Tom, who's dressing up in his clothes and imitating him in front of mirrors, and Tom is realising he won't persuade Philippe to return to the USA and collect his father's reward. He's also falling in love with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge. So Tom decides to kill him.The murder, one of the highlights of the movie, happens in one of my favourite settings in a yacht in open sea, away from civilisation and witnesses. It's a setting that several directors have exploited, from Roman Polanski to Claude Chabrol to Phillip Noyce. Few situations invoke tension and fear like the illusive peacefulness of the sea because, as Clémént shows, nature doesn't choose sides and can quickly become an obstacle to a well-planned murder.Alain Delon, younger than I've ever seen him in a movie, plays Tom Ripley. He plays the famous sociopath with ruthlessness and premeditation, hiding his emotions, if he has any, under an ice-cold look that is Delon's trademark. He delivers a fine performance, but his Ripley is not perfect. In the novel the villain seek to erase his identity and become someone else, someone of a better social class. The movie eschews the study of identity and class differences and makes Ripley a more traditional murderer, who kills a man for money and for a girl.The character of Marge (Marie Laforêt) gives to the movie little other than her beauty and a reason to pit between Tom against Philippe. I, however, prefer Tom in love with himself, a narcissist who doesn't need others. And Laforêt doesn't come close to Gwyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version, who shows intuition and backbone.Maurice Ronet, however, is perfect in the role of Philippe (he's also a dead ringer of Jude Law). Half school bully, half bon vivant, the playboy side of the character is captured by Ronet with ease, although Philippe is so insensitive, it's difficult at times to have sympathy for him.Purple Noon is beautiful to look at and not just because Clément is filming in picturesque Italian cities by the sea. The cinematography is in the hands of Henri Decaë, who's lent his talent to filmmakers like Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and François Truffaut. Although the screenplay doesn't seem too interested in the question of identity, the camera, through its countless games with mirrors and reflections, tries to force the novel's main theme back into the movie.The movie is very suspenseful, even for those who think they know the story. Clément takes enough liberties with the novel to make the story fresh. Tom's main problem continues to be juggling the privileges his new identity gives him with remaining anonymous, a difficult task when he's impersonating the son of a rich man.I've always loved films that show the perspective of killers and social outcasts. Between seeing a detective investigating and seeing a killer using his wits to remain free, I prefer the latter. There's nothing more thrilling and fascinating than being privy to a killer's mind for a couple of hours. What can we ask of fiction other than what we can't get from daily life? That's what Purple Noon is a little outing from normal life into the life of a sociopath, told without regrets and empathy, like Tom Ripley.

Though taking quite a few liberties from the source novel (the 1999 The Talented Mr. Ripley remake will take as many liberties as well), this adaption is still quite intriguing. The story is about a Mr. Thomas Ripley (a miscast Alain Delon) who is sent from San Francisco (in the book it was New York) to retrieve a millionaire's son Philippe (in the book it was Dickie) Greenleaf (well acted by Maurice Ronet) from his leisure life of boating in Italy. Ripley's mission to lure Philippe back to the states, is sabotaged by his own sense of attraction to Philippe's Italian lifestyle. Ripley becomes fixated on Philippe, which in itself has homosexual connotations. Not only does he want him, he wants to be him. And when Ripley realizes that he can't have him, he opts for the latter. The movie sort of begins in the middle of the book, letting the actions of the characters to help shape and explain the earlier happenings. Alain Delon seems (to me) to be slightly miscast as the awkward Tom Ripley, because you can't really imagine Alain Delon really wanting to be anyone other than Alain Delon. But aside from the miscasting (which is no fault to Alain), Alain Delon is a very intriguing Tom Ripley. He definitely has a dark edge about him, that is untrustworthy and a personality that would fit a murderer. But also Alain Delon at least has the quality that audience want to root for in an anti-hero. In the book, you tend to see through the eyes of Tom Ripley and can easily justify (like he does) the crimes he commits as a necessary evil to get where he needs to go.This is what Purple Noon is great about capturing, and where the remake kind of fails (though don't get me wrong, I quite love the remake as well). Purple Noon captures the kind of isolation in which Tom Ripley experiences in the book, where the remake has so many added characters, that you never get the feeling that Tom is ever alone. Rene Clement's direction is amazing. Italy has never looked so beautiful (well, not until the remake at least), with great locations of the sun drenched country. Both films celebrate the seductive world in which Mr. Greenleaf inhabits, and could make a murderer out of anyone. Midway, I've found that both films suffer when Mr. Greenleaf exits the movie. Actor Billy Kearns resembles Freddy Miles perfectly in the book, and adds just the right amount of irritation to the role. While Marie Laforet is exotically pretty as Marge Duval (in the book it's Marge Sheerwood), the love interest of both men. A really great movie, taken from an even greater novel, with another great music score supplied by Nino Rota. Look for a young Romy Schneider as one of Freddy Miles' companion. Highly recommended to people who love Alfred Hitchcock mysteries with a far more perverse edge.

Its visual stylishness and the music score, and mostly Alain Delon's cool, cold-blooded and totally amoral character are the best things in this gorgeous-looking movie. About the 1999 version I have to say that Matt Damon's Ripley remains closer to Highsmith's conception of the character. But then Jude Law's Dickie is an irritating spoilt brat and Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge is an ass. Only Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie Miles is good because he is exactly like the character in the book loud,a disgusting slob and a total pain in the neck. I couldn't wait for Matt Damon to kill him, really. And then, what is Cate Blanchett's character doing in the story when she didn't exist in the novel? She is nosy and another fool and only makes things worse for Ripley. The only fault I find in Plein Soleil is the ending. We must blame it to the censorship codes of the time Ripley had to be found out in the last minute and caught. Of course it was unacceptable that a murderer should get away unpunished. What a shame. This film will remain as a key point in the transition of the thriller genre from the conservative 1950s to the cool 1960s visual style, rhythm, music score, titles design... They all give us a glimpse of the good things to come Charade, Topkapi, James Bond...And it also has given cinema one of its most iconic images a shirtless Alain Delon at the helm of the boat under the sultry Mediterranean sun.

The camera work is excellent throughout and a little unusual.I, too, did not care for the ending, which was not Highsmith's.One thing i've never bought about this story is the fact that Ripley hung around the same area as Marge and Philippe's friends after becoming him.

Delon was one of the coolest and most charismatic screen presences ever, and a terrific actor to boot. He was always fantastic at playing quiet criminals, witness this and Le Samourai.

Hitch was actually famous for stating that he never read the base material more than one time before beginning to think the film.For people arguing that Minghella's adaptation is closer to the source material than Clement's I have to say that You are missing the point. Both are pretty good psycho-thrillers, but both only borrows parts of Highsmith to prove their own point, which I, as Hitch would have, believe is the sane way of adapting.Actually what is called The homo-erotic Overtones in comments are blown up in the latest version more than they are toned down in the first one. Highsmith is quite aware of the frigthning aspect of a male villain that seem to be too much interested in another male character - and she used that very well in Strangers on a Train. But she used it as Hitchcock did, not only when he was adapting her stories, but in much of his work. The Hero/Villain would in his film often be sexually weak (think Rear Window, Rope, Psycho) but more that making these characters gay - which some of them obviously was - he used this as conveying a strangeness to the character. Some might say, that he would have made his characters more obviously gay, had he lived in a time, where it is possible to do so (the same might be said of Clement), but again we're then missing the point.We should never object to elements in a movie, suspecting it would have been different (better) were it made today. It's a fog blinding the real qualities of the movie itself.Now what about Plein Soleil You'd might ask. It's no masterpiece but a nearly forgotten gem that should be seen on as big a screen as you can get it to play on. Nino Rota (credited as Rotta) has made a compelling score, the cinematography is excellent and the acting is from very good to outstanding.And should we compare the two versions, Minghella has surely ripped of the best of the scenes from the original adaptation. Not that stealing isn't allowed in the arts - but it IS a bit funny, that a movie about a con-artist, that can imitate whoever he want, is itself a sort of an impersonator.See them both. Enjoy Highsmiths novel too.

I have also seen the more recent American version with Matt Damon as Ripley, and if the story interests you, then both versions are worth seeing.  Purple Noon sticks much more explicitly to the novel in the sense that Ripley is portrayed in a more sinister, calculating way.  The American version seeks to make Ripley a more accessible, humanistic person that the audience might sympathize with.  Both of these formulas have advantages and disadvantages.  Purple Noon's Ripley is often more ostensibly fascinating precisely because he is so cold and amoral.  It arouses the same kind of twisted attraction as a Hannibal Lector, for example.  However, the supporting cast, like the novel itself, are not so much characters as plot devices.  They are not very well fleshed-out, and can seem a bit cardboard at times.  On the flipside, the Ripley portrayed by Matt Damon may lose some of his excitement because he is presented in more human terms, but his ambiguity works in the sense that Ripley never has a sense of self, and is only happy and interesting when he is in someone else's shoes.  The American version also has an amazing supporting cast, whose characters are done the justice that they deserve.

For the people who read the book,there are a lot of differences though the brunette Marie Laforet is not Marge at all,neither physically(G.Paltrow seems a better choice),nor intellectually .In Highsmith's novel she's a bubblehead girl,whose main obsession is not to lose her lover in favor of Ripley whom she suspects of being a faghe is not,in the book either,he may be bisexual,but Highsmith remains ambiguous.As for Clement,in France of the late fifties,it was impossible to allow some doubthence the love affair with Marge,totally absent in the novel(Ripley despises Marge,he nearly tries to kill her ).But the main difference is the endingRipley takes all the money and run in the book,but then again,a moral ending was necessary on the screen.I will not spoil this conclusion,that packs quite a wallop!

Ebert is probably in the minority here, as it is hard to see how a remake forty years later can surpass the original when the original is done so well.The underlying theme is the artist as criminal, and it's interesting. When does a crime become a work of art? Is it in the eye of the beholder? Or there a craft to it?

Hired by his friend's wealthy father, Mr. Delon hopes to collect $5,000 for bringing Mr. Ronet back home to San Francisco. They may never get there. The party-loving men go out on Ronet's boat, along with girlfriend Marie Laforet (as Marge Duval). There, murderous intentions bubble to the surface...There are few minor problems with this revision of novelist Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley (1955). Still, you will see a lot of perfection on the screen. Under skillful and innovative direction from Rene Clement, Delon's devastatingly handsome, aloof and sneaky anti-hero perversely appealed to viewers. He became a major star. On or off the water, Henri Decae's photography is appropriately drop-dead gorgeous and Nino Rota's musical score is surprisingly complimentary. The story was memorably re-made in 1999 by director Anthony Minghella, with the primary roles filled by Matt Damon, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. The 1999 version took gay subtext and shoved it up your screen. You did not see much of that in 1960... Even in France... Although it drifts too far from the source, this version still rocks the boat.********* Plein soleil (1960-03-10) Rene Clement ~ Alain Delon, Maurice Ronet, Marie Laforet, Billy Kearns "},{"Title":"darkness under the burning sun","Date":"1 January 2009","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller","Review":" Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley is a great movies criminal, and this Plein Soleil is famous most of all for bringing to world wide exposure Alain Delon in his first complex and dark role as the criminal later played by such followers as Matt Damon or John Malkovich. The whole story of a friendship that becomes murder turns around Delon's acting and he is superb, then a rising star at the start of a decade of great acting. Marie Laforet at her debut matches well Delon as his romantic interest and partial motive of murder. It is probably the best film of director Rene Clement together maybe with 'La Belle et la Bette' where he seconded Jean Cocteau who was the sole credited for directing. His cinema work is stylish and full of light, contrasting with the dark theme. All has a very modern and contemporary look, and the film does not look at all as an almost half century old production. The acting of the supporting team is however below the level of the stars. A lot has been said about the ending which is changed from the original ending in the novel - it tends to be somehow moralistic but it also includes a thrilling surprise and I actually liked it.

It feels, in many ways like a French attempt to do a Steve McQueen-style Hollywood film.Despite the dated style, this remains an effective character study of a sociopath. Delon's villain is amoral and lacking in any visible trace of compassion as he murders his friend and seeks to take control of his fortune only to be undone by his own arrogance and sloppiness. The transitions from playfulness to murderousness to fear are well-handled and one gains an insight into his shallow, greed-driven world.The bright colour photography unfortunately contrasts with the dark, brooding nature of the tale, further undermining the story.There is little innovation in the editing and the minor characters, such as the female love interest, are little more than ciphers.One cannot help but feel that this story, based on an American novel, has lost something in its transition between cultures. With better direction and a little more thought, this could have become a classic. Instead it feels like a strange dinosaur, caught between the old and the new.

But neither version I felt really motivated the Tom character to take possession of Greenleaf's life. Why? In both versions, Tom is an awkward geek who turns violent because he's too lazy to make his own money. (insecure?) So he hijacks someone else's life as that is the easier route. But I felt the friendship (homoerotic tones?) tension was not enough to inspire Tom to commit murder. In the latter version, yes, Jude Law is a snobby jerk enough that you do wanna ring his neck. But that's his character. I just felt that Tom's character was not fully realized in the beginning of either movie and therein lies the failure.I just happen to coincidentally read the novella before I saw either movie and I found the original source to be far superior to either film. Now there's lies the tension and motivation I so need in my characters, flawed and corrosive as they are.Additionally, both versions are gorgeous to look at. Now I wanna visit that part of southern Italy I have never been to.

The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. It's deadly slow. I don't mind slow movies (I love the original SOLARIS) but for a thriller, there were few thrills to be had during its entire 2 hours time. And casting Alain Delon as Tom Ripley is, even if Delon's acting is good, totally wrong. The Tom Ripley character is an average looking guy nobody cares about and who can't ever get a fair break. He fades in the background and because of this, he's capable of being a chameleon of sorts. It's hard to imagine someone like Delon in the part of a man whom no one notices or cares about. He's just too handsome for Tom Ripley. Another big problem with the film is Tom's relationship with Dickey (named Phil in this movie). In the book (and in TALENTED MR RIPLEY) there's a special love/hate relationship between the two men. In PLEIN SOLEIL, Tom's relationship with Dickey is strictly business. This oversight basically pulls the rug from under the whole meaning of the story.But even with all these faults, PURPLE NOON is light years better than the Matt Damon/Minguella crappy production (see my IMDB review) and it is one of the best looking films I've ever seen. It looks like it was made yesterday. The cinematography is so eye-pleasing that it's often breath-taking. And the actress who played Marge is way better than Gwyneth Paltrow. So, in the end, the film is half successful. PLEIN SOLEIL is not as moronically simpleminded as the disastrous Minguella version but it's still not true to Highsmith's Ripley books. But it is worth checking out just for the cinematography and the film's look.

Subsequently I read the original novel by Patricia Highsmith, before stumbling upon this gem.  As a film, `Plein Soleil,' is somewhat more engaging, and features excellent acting by Alain Delon and exquisite cinematography from Henri Decaë.  It must be said that Delon was a bit too pretty to accurately portray Tom Ripley, and while I thoroughly enjoyed the cinematography, the mood ended up far different from the novel.  It seems that director René Clément was focused on making a quality film, and less concerned with a faithful reproduction of the story (as evidenced in the revised ending).  Strictly for comparison, it appeared to me that Minghella more accurately sensed the mood of the original, rife with quiet brooding and dark hatred.  I must agree with other reviewers who pointed out the miscasting of Gwyneth Paltrow in the remake, as I much preferred the casting and performance of Marie Laforêt.  However, neither actress possessed the aire of normalcy and simplicity offered by the novel.  While the revised ending did not trouble me, I was disappointed that a faithful adaptation of the novel, or its successors, has yet been made.  Each director seems to have reinterpreted or misinterpreted the original story, perhaps out of the uncomfortable compassion the reader develops with the nefarious Ripley.  That said, if you have seen the 1999 remake, watching this film will be an enjoyable perspective on the story, in many ways the superior.

Alain Delon captures much of the beauty and blankness of the protagonist, although his portrayal of  Ripley as essentially an ultimate go-getter or striver is different from what's in the book. Beautifully shot by director Clement and cinematographer Henri Decae, who gives his compositions something of the feeling of overripe fruit. The ending differs from the book, injecting a kind of conventional morality that cold-hearted Highsmith would never have subscribed to, but within the constraints of Clement's adaptation it works. Recommended, though I'd like to see a faithful adaptation someday.

Anyone who likes unusual, well-plotted, beautiful movies should see both versions.What does my one-line summary mean?

Basically it's a fairly faithful adaptation of the book until the end (back then, evil had to be punished). A tale of murder, lust and homosexual undertones (some of the interplay between actors Alain Delon and Maurice Ronet is crackling with sexual feelings).The movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.  Rich, bright color, gorgeous scenery, all the clothes look good---basically, everything is perfect!  That alone makes the movie worth seeing.Unfortunately, there are problems.  The story is kind of vague (they cut the novel down) and all the characters are unpleasant--there's not one likable person in the entire movie.  Therefore when they're killed or attacked you could care less.  The acting--Alain Delon was (back then) only 25 and just impossibly handsome (nice bod too).  His acting though is just so-so--he seems miscast in this role--he's too handsome for it.  Still, he's so good-looking that you don't care.  The rest of the cast is OK.So, see it for the color photography.

Highsmith's novels have been favored by a number of international directors, including Hitchcock and Wenders and more recently Minghella's own attempt to get at Mr. Ripley.There is much to like about this movie visually. The views of the Italian Mediterranean, the street scenes in Rome and of village life, even the daytime holiday celebration (fireworks in daylight!) are breathtaking, the sort of thing you hope one day to be able to see on a really big screen. The feel of the movie is right too, effortlessly recreating Italy in the 50s, down to the cars, clothes, food, and people on the street.What's wrong is the characters, a problem most other directors of Highsmith's novels have had. To begin with, the ostensibly American Philippe (Philip) Greenleaf, Tom Ripley, and Marge Duval are most decidedly non-Americans. They don't look like Americans, they don't act like Americans, and they certainly don't move like Americans. Only the character of Freddy Miles is credibly American and then perhaps only because he's in so few scenes.A more serious problem is that Clement doesn't appear to know who Ripley is, or at least doesn't know who Highsmith's Ripley is. In the various Ripley novels, written over a period of nearly forty years, Ripley is an amoral killer who is often forced to murder out of loyalty or to keep his past a secret. In Clement's hands, Ripley is puerile, almost juvenile, with a fairly good motive for hurting Greenleaf. Only during the scenes of Ripley alone on the boat can you catch a glimpse of Highsmith's Ripley. But as soon as he's back in the company of Marge and the others he once again becomes something almost pathetic, almost pathological.Why is it so difficult for film directors to capture certain literary characters? In Ripley's case, perhaps it's because he's neither a basically good character nor a truly bad character. He's somewhere else on the moral landscape, someone who in the novels definitely feels guilt and anguish over what he does, although in Ripley these are not the character-destroying emotions you would expect but rather a kind of painful regret or feeling of disloyalty. Clement's attempts to capture this, if indeed that's what he was trying to do, feel completely wrong. I'm thinking of the several scenes of Ripley ravenously eating after committing a crime. Is Ripley emotionally starved? It's hard to say, but these scenes come across more as black humor than as insights into Ripley's character. At one point, after committing a murder, Ripley gazes out the window at children playing innocently on the street below. Without a narrator, it's hard to figure what's going on in his head here. Guilt? Relief? Longing? Or is he just checking to see if the coast is clear?Purple Noon has great suspense and, despite its trick ending, will remain in your head, vivid and pleasantly memorable, long after viewing. But for readers of Highsmith's novels it will always feel like a bit of a failure.

By cutting to the chase (when the film opens, Ripley has already met up with Greenleaf and Marge in Italy), you're pulled right into the story. This film runs 25 minutes less &#150; and seems even shorter because the tension builds from the very beginning (whereas Minghella's film sets up a lot of exposition). The gay angle is pretty heavily hinted at throughout most of this film, although it's clear at the end that Ripley is at least playing at being straight. Alain Delon is great and the ending does pack a wallop.But in one critical way, the 1999 version is far better (warning &#150; spoiler) at the end of that film, just as Ripley thinks he's beaten the odds, he is forced to destroy something he loves in order to extricate himself from yet another lie. In the end, he is left with only himself to blame for the emptiness of his life.
