I don't know how much was Streep, how much stunt-double, and how much effects, but her character emerges as a convincing woman of action who is also an anxious mother.Kevin Bacon is very effective as a regular guy, who just happens to be a psychotic criminal in his off moments; John C Reilly plays his weak, shifty sidekick; and Joseph Mazzello is the son, who initially finds Bacon more fun than his dad. It is David Strathairn, though, who for me takes the male acting honours, as a distant, serious-minded husband and father, who gets going when the going gets tough - though luckily, through thick and thin, he never loses his glasses! There is more than a touch of Deliverance, and the ending is pre-ordained; but the film is entertaining and gripping throughout, and is aided by some breathtaking Rockies scenery, beautifully shot.

I thought the relationships between all the characters and how they gradually change was the most believable and interesting part. How Kevin Bacon's character first strikes a bonding with the son, in order to win Meryl Streep's trust, and how this friendly atmosphere slowly glides to threat was very realistic. The only really annoying scene was the last one, where one police officer asks the son What did your father do?, to which he replies My father saved our lives. What a heroic, pathetic conversation after having survived such a life-threatening nightmare! All in all, this movie is recommendable, but you shouldn't expect too much.

Streep is definitely the actress of our time, and in no small part to her ability to tackle difficult roles of many colors, and do them without breaking a sweat.  Such is true with The River Wild, a predictable, but entertaining river rapids adventure/hostage drama.  Streep incorporates her role with strength, humor, and even a bit of vulnerability.  Backed by the menacing Kevin Bacon and the refined David Strathairn (the ultimate everyman...that's a compliment), Streep holds her own in a genre that one doesn't necessarily think of when her name comes to mind.  One tremendous scene involves Streep reminding her captor (Bacon) of the dangers of the upcoming waterfall/rapids system known as The Gauntlet...Streep whispers determination and threats, promises of anger and doom, directly into Bacon's ears with a quite rage, only to be turned to an edge-of-tears monologue when her family comes to mind.  Bravo to Curtis Hanson's pre-L.A. Confidential film (1997's SHOULD HAVE for Director and Picture).  The plot itself may have holes, but with the talents of Streep, backed with the reliable cast, The River Wild packs quite a punch of entertainment and thrills.

Once there they meet another group heading down river and, when Wade and Terry lose their guide, Gail agrees to let them follow them in their own boat. However when Gail and Tom begin to feel uncomfortable with their guests they try to slip away unnoticed &#150; only for Wade to pull a gun and insist that Gail will help them proceed downriver and cross the legendary Gauntlet.I first watched this when it came out in the cinema and I remember enjoying it. However noticing it back on television recently I couldn't help but be a little uninterested in it and wondered if I had just false memories of how good it really had been and so decided to watch it again and see. After a slow opening the film gets down to business with the two boats getting together and gradually going to the conclusion that we know is coming but enjoy heading towards anyway. The film delivers its straightforward plot well in the early stages, using the father-figure conflict well (even if it ignores the heavy feminist subtext) to generate the tension, while the later stages is more of a simple hostage thriller sort of affair. This aspect is still quite enjoyable even if it is not as tight as it really needed to be and, as a non-rafter, I wasn't sure how intimidated I was meant to be by the load of water that was the gauntlet.As a result, the film is a little talky but the cast are able to deal with it and it is really only the clunky, slow start that suffers as a result. I'm not a big fan of Meryl Streep and I didn't think she was totally fitted to the material given her but mostly her performance was natural enough to be convincing. Strathairn plays second fiddle to Streep but he is still enjoyable as he delivers an insecure character. With these two big names in the lead it would have been easy for them to dominate but it is Kevin Bacon that steals the film with a charismatic performance that he easily turns into menace &#150; hardly his greatest performance but he makes more of it than others have in the past. Mazzello is a typical 'cute kid' American actor but he is good enough for this material and he is pretty good in the first half when he is given the material. Reilly and Bratt add some well-known faces to the mix but really neither has that much to do.Overall this is not a great film but it is good enough to be worth seeing once. The action is not typical for this genre and the novelty value of it makes it seem more interesting. The film looks good and it is tense enough to do the job while the plot gets past the slow start to deliver an interesting set up and a solid enough series of set pieces with a good cast and director onboard (sorry!).

The first one was incredibly talented young actor named Joseph Mazello, while the second was Kevin Bacon, also very good and underrated actor in my opinion. I expected just an average thriller or something like that but this movie managed to surpass my expectations. Though it wasn't a great or Oscar-worthy movie I found The River Wild mostly good and entertained, worth seeing movie. The story is concentrated on average dysfunctional family with workaholic father, who have almost lost a contact with his wife and two kids. They undertake a raft journey on vacation to celebrate their eldest son, Rourke birthday and in the same time trying to save their dying marriage. This at first calm and beautiful journey gets unexpectedly dangerous when the family meet on their way two strangers (played by Kevin Bacon and John C.Reilly), who also for their own reasons go to a journey with the same route. The story is not flawless and has some plot holes but overall it's not bad written. Well, maybe it's quite predictable but I don't think that such predictability harmed the movie too much. The acting overall was pretty good. To my surprise somehow happened that Meryl Streep became a weakest part in this excellent cast ensemble. I think she was a bit unconvincing as careful mother as well as a strong rafter. Another problem is that her character (Gail) is not developed as much as the movie needs it. For unknown reasons she got even a Golden Globe nomination for this movie but anyway The River Wild definitely is not among her best works. David Straithairn is much better playing Gail's husband and Roarke's father. Kevin Bacon is brilliant as evil, psychotic villain, while John C.Reilly gave decent performance of his diffident, weak-willed sidekick. And finally Joseph Mazello, the most talented actor among entire casts in the movie. His part didn't give him many opportunities to show his talent but in those short moments his acting was beautiful and he was able to overshadow others. Despite all these very good performances the most exceptional thing about The River Wild is not the good acting but a beautiful scenery and excellent cinematography that have captured it. Even only this terrific scenery, filmed somewhere in Oregon, is enough to make this movie worth seeing. It's simply beyond my words. Finally, it is worth to mention nice score, written by Jerry Goldmith, with excellent main theme.In the conclusion The River Wild is not great but quite a good movie, with good casts, acting and one of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen.

I cannot see Kevin in any movie without thinking of his performance in River Wild because I really think you're seeing the real deal. Because of that, Kevin was one of the most terrifying movie characters that I have ever experienced.Seriously, in real life, Kevin Bacon may be a nice guy, may be a sweetheart, may do volunteer work, may go to church regularly, may be a good dad, may be a coach for his daughter's soccer team. I really don't know, but I tell you one thing, if I ever meet Kevin Bacon, I will tell him he gave an outstanding performance in this movie. And while I am in his company, I will NEVER turn my back on him. He just spooks me out and will always do so. what greater compliment is there? I thought this movie was extremely well cast. I know the ending is predictable, but the best thing about this movie is that it is believable. Anyone of us could have been stuck in that situation. Ever go up an elevator with a person who you feel uncomfortable with? If the elevator gets stuck... what do you do? This is basically the same as the movie.

It stars Meryl Streep as Gail Hartman, an expert camper and white-water rafter who is stuck in an increasingly stale marriage to Tom (David Strathairn). For her son Roarke (Joseph Mazello) 13rth birthday they decide to go out into the wild for a weekend. They come across two other rafters, Wade and Terry (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) who take an interest in the boy. At first, it appears they have an agenda- they provoke Tom's jealousy as Gail is drawn to Wade, possibly because he reminds her of herself as a young girl. But Wade becomes a menace. He's a wanted theft and he forces the family into a precarious situation. They must cross extremely dangerous waters to get to their destination and fight off these baddies. This hard experience ultimately brings the family together. Tom, who changes from a weak father to hero, is a rather interesting transformation to see on film and he is played well by David Straithairn, a fab actor who is unfortunately underrated. Meryl Streep appears to be doing a film she would normally not attempt. She proves her versatility as a cool nature-loving mother and does not possess any of the Hollywood-fed glamour for this role. She is convincing as a middle-class American wife. The cinematography is stunning. The rapids are gorgeous and exciting to look at, the grand scenes of mountains and forests, rocks, steep cliffs. The music score is also lovely. A great film from the 90's by a director who's had fine and different-themed films in his repertoire.

How exciting does that sound? It sound like a 'based on true events' Hallmark type of movie. But don't be fooled. The River Wild is a movie that has plenty to offer, despite its very restrained concept and settings of the movie.The movie is also more original than you perhaps would expect. The movie also does a fair job at keeping things sort of a mystery for a long time. I especially like how 'the bad guys' try to set up the family against each other to create disorder and different camps, of which they can profit from for their own benefit. It's perhaps not as good and prominently executed as it could had but nevertheless the movie gets points for the attempt, that also I must say mostly works out due to Kevin Bacon's fine role.Watching this movie sort of makes you think what a shame it is that Bacon doesn't really play villainous roles anymore. He only played these sort of roles in the early '90's, though he had an obvious talent for it. Not that he plays crappy roles now but nevertheless it remains a shame he doesn't play more often the bad guy. He is perfectly good in his role in this movie. He knows to portray a likable character that you're also able to hate at times. A real achievement. But also credits have to go to Meryl Streep, who plays a fine strong female lead and other great actors such as David Strathairn, Joseph Mazzello and John C. Reilly.Despite that it's not the most exciting movie in its genre it still is one that is always fast going and never boring to watch. The movie mostly features nature action, set on the river. So it's a pretty original movie in its genre but I don't know, movies set at mostly the same locations are just never among my favorite or most exciting ones to watch, such as for instance in my personal experience also was the case with movies such as Speed and Phone Booth.The movie is of course a great looking, thanks to its nature settings. Also the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is really worth mentioning.It's just a fine movie, that is perfectly put together and has a great cast but it's just not the finest exciting genre movie thinkable and it perhaps is also a bit too simplistic, also due to its restraints.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"The Ride of your life","Date":"12 November 2000","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Review":"  The River wild Is an amazing film!!

Gail previously having worked as a guide on the river agrees. This is their story which differs somewhat to the actual truth as to what they are up to and soon husband Tom gets suspicious of the pair, as well he might! What follows is a roller-coaster ride of thrills, splashes, action and tension which successfully make this 90's action thriller a force to be reckoned with. It manages to keep the audience entertained and enthralled as Streep goes head to head with the two villains and of course the gushing river that cuts through the movie. The River Wild does what it says on the tin, all the while refraining from hiding behind any CGI effects, instead just using good old fashioned stunt work and great acting.Directed by Curtis Hanson who had previously directed 'The Hand That Rocked The Cradle', he uses his previous skill in pumping up the tension successfully and there are some great moments that make you wonder what is going to happen next.Meryl Streep is great as usual and plays the strong, level-headed female lead well, yet still with an air of vulnerability at the same time. Kevin Bacon is an excellent primary antagonist as Wade, along with his dumb partner in crime Terry. It's actually fun to watch as he uses his superficial charm to gain the trust of Gail and her family and then switching to a malevolent bad guy as soon as his motives are exposed. The scenes between Streep and Bacon are tense and dark which increases the pace even further.There are strong supporting characters too, including David Strathairn's serious yet underestimated husband role. Joseph Mazzello, from Jurassic Park fame, is Gail's son who puts in a good performance here. Benjamin Bratt also makes a small appearance as a guide on the river. John C Reilly appears in an early career role and has since had stronger roles in film.I have rated this film highly as it kept me entertained throughout.

He doesn't have any emotional scenes but still manages to superbly transmit his awkwardness with both his surroundings and a wife and son who are slipping away from him. And while Strathairn matches Streep, Bacon surpasses her as the initially charismatic Wade, one of a trio of criminals on the run after robbing a cattle market.The robbers, their numbers reduced by one after a spat, smoothly invite themselves to join the Hartman party and it isn't long before Wade is slyly exploiting the cracks he spies in the relationship between Tom (Strathairn) and his son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello). The film focuses as much on the psychological aspect of the interaction of the four main characters (John C. Reilly as Wade's sidekick is a bystander for the most part) as it does on the action scenes, which is probably why it was more enjoyable than the straightforward action pics Hollywood normally produces. Even the finale is as much about psychological cat-and-mouse games as action set-pieces - which isn't a bad thing in my book.

Such films generally deal with a divorced or estranged couple, or a couple whose marriage has been going through a difficult patch, rediscovering their love for one another. They were especially popular in the thirties and forties, but there have been a number of recent examples such as Sweet Home Alabama and Did you Hear about the Morgans? The River Wild can be seen as a thriller of remarriage. Like Did you Hear about the Morgans? it deals with a big-city couple whose marriage is in trouble but who manage to save it while on a trip to a rural part of the American West. The difference between the two films, apart from the fact that the motive for that trip is quite different in each case, is that Did you Hear about the Morgans? tells its story in the form of a comedy, The River Wild in the form of a serious thriller. Tom and Gail, a middle-class Boston couple, are having marital problems. Gail, a teacher of deaf children, feels that Tom, an architect, spends too much time at work and neglects his family. Gail is originally from Idaho, and decides to take her young children Roarke and Willa on holiday to see her parents, who still live in that state. Gail is also an expert at whitewater rafting, and before her move to Boston worked as a rafting guide on a local river. (The river wild of the title; the film-makers may have chosen this unconventional word order to avoid confusion with Wild River, the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan). She decides to take Roarke on a holiday rafting trip down the river, Willa (who stays with her grandparents) presumably being too young to come along. At the last minute Tom joins them, and the three set off on their trip together. Near the beginning of their trip, the family meet two other rafters, Wade and Terry. At first the two men appear to be friendly, but Gail slowly becomes suspicious of them, and she and Tom decide to leave them behind. The attempt fails, and Wade pulls a gun on them. It transpires that the two men are criminals who have just committed a robbery and are using the river as a means of escape; they need Gail's rafting skills to get them past the Gauntlet, a particularly dangerous stretch of river. The rest of the film tells of the family's efforts to thwart the robbers and of how their shared danger helps to mend the relationship between Gail and Tom. The film marked something of a new departure for Meryl Streep, previously often seen as a rather serious, cerebral actress. Although she had made occasional ventures into comedy, in films like She-Devil and Death Becomes Her, this was her first appearance as an action heroine. It is not the sort of role which she has reprised since 1994, but she makes the most of it here; she even, apparently, performed most of her own stunts. David Strathairn, more often seen in supporting roles, here achieves leading man status as Tom. There is also a good performance from Kevin Bacon, generally a reliable villain, as Wade, at first friendly and plausible, later a raging psychopath. (John C. Reilly's Terry seems almost likable by comparison). Curtis Hanson is not a particularly prolific director; in a career lasting nearly forty years he has only made fourteen films. Some of those, however, especially in the thriller genre, have been good ones, such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and the excellent neo-noir L.A. Confidential. The River Wild is another example of Hanson at his best, even though there are occasional implausible moments; some of the characters- especially Tom, the bespectacled, nerdish-looking architect- occasionally perform feats of strength or agility more often seen in superhero movies. The basic story- family menaced by violent criminals- may be an over-familiar one, but it is certainly handled in an exciting manner here. Curtis's direction is brilliant; this is one thriller that is genuinely worthy of the name, moving along at a cracking pace. The scenes on the river, especially when Gail is taking the raft down the Gauntlet, are heart-stopping. The cinematography of the beautiful wild scenery of the Pacific North-West is magnificent. The River Wild must count as one of the best-made thrillers of the nineties. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Meryl Rules","Date":"4 August 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Review":" A different role for Meryl Streep, as a former river guide with domestic problems.

While it lacks the rawness of similarly-themed independent fare and the kind of twists and surprises you'd expect from the best this genre has to offer, it tells the story it sets out to tell with a large amount of success, mainly thanks to the lean script and no-nonsense pacing. Much of the action comes from a series of spectacular white-water rafting sequences in which the stunt team are really put through their paces. These mark the film's highlight. The human plot, involving a couple of hostage-takers, is less spectacular, but the film still gets by thanks to the calibre of the cast.Meryl Streep, although a little too earnest in some places for my liking, takes plaudits as the outdoors expert who has to use her wits to survive both nature and the evils of mankind. Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly are fine as the no-good criminals, and Benjamin Bratt bags a nice little role as a good-guy ranger. Youngster Joe Mazzello is a more mature presence than in the previous year's JURASSIC PARK, and David Straithairn (THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM) gets to have some fun as the straight-laced father forced into becoming a hero. Okay, so you know the outcome from the outset (and in a 12-certificate family adventure nothing THAT bad is ever going to happen), but this is nonetheless a mildly entertaining little movie.

Something about her unkempt hairdo and the fact that she's the muscle in the raft.

This was the case for The river wild. The overall gist of the movie was not displeasing, but the plot was horribly predictable. Average, everyday family with parents not quite getting along on vacation meets friendly strangers who begin to seem slightly creepy, and surprise! They turn out to be convicted criminals who need the experienced rafter mother in the family to get them across the river to their getaway car. The father tries to protect his family, but is shot at and presumed dead. (but he's not! He just has the extraordinary ability to hold his breath underwater for 5 minutes!) The rest of the cast continues down the river until later on, when the father makes a surprise appearance, saves his family, the main bad guy gets shot (conveniently by the mother, who earlier in the movie swore to kill him, and after doing so shows absolutely no emotion of any sort. Hmmm...) and the hapless henchman is taken to jail. The family now lives happily ever after, with both parents now getting along marvelously (with lots of kissing, too!) and the young, impressionable son agrees to not talk to strangers anymore.The plot is fiendishly predictable and boring, and the characters are ones that are often used as well the athletic, courageous, intelligent, protective, and pretty much flawless mother (Meryl Streep), her loser husband (David Strathairn) who later on in the film gets to show that he does have some good qualities as well! (including some pretty impressive fighting moves! Was this guy a boxer in college, or what?) Then there's their young son, (Joseph Mazello) who says that he's not afraid, then proceeds to scream a lot. And the villains the main criminal (Kevin Bacon) who runs the show and manages to pass himself off as charming and likable, despite the fact that he's secretly a very evil pervert, and his bumbling, uneducated and much friendlier sidekick, (John C. Reilly) who tries to make friends with the kid, says that he 'don't wanna go back to jail,' and that he 'never knew anybody was gonna get hurt!' Yawn.This movie is riddled with thoroughly average acting, with the exceptions of Kevin Bacon as Wade (he's so good at being villainous!) and, despite his age, Joseph Mazello as Roarke, giving a similar role, but much better performance than in Jurassic Park. Nobody else's performance stood out that much, although nobody did that bad of a job; just nothing spectacular. Personally, I would have expected Meryl Streep to have done a better job; she's renowned for being an excellent actress, but I wasn't particularly swept away by her performance.The setting was perfect, and the scenery was beautiful - it really complimented the movie, and the camera work showed it off perfectly, with lots of zooming out to demonstrate the whole scene, then zooming back in to focus on the actors again. Definitely a high point. Unfortunately, this was ruined by the theme song to the movie, which although started out beautiful, was terribly overused, and started to really grate on the viewer's nerves after it was replayed (sometimes by different instruments, which didn't really do much) for the 50th time, or so. It would have been much better, (and more successful at keeping the audience awake) had they varied the music a little bit.Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, and it was handled well enough, but they were stuck with a storyline that had been used way too many times before which flattened the mood. Although there was some decent acting which helped, excellent scenery and cinematography and a good climax, with the passengers of the raft struggling through the 'gauntlet'.

I would not say that it is a pure horror movie, especially since people expect horror to have nasty creatures in it, but there are elements of it there. This movie is about a family who decide to take their son, Rouke, on a rafting holiday down a river. The wife (Meryl Streep) is an expert rafter and rower and she used to be a ranger in the park where they are rafting, but now she has moved to the city where she rows in much calmer waters. At the same time, three men are also rafting down the river, but their guide supposedly leaves after a fight and they must join up. The family soon begin to distrust the two men and it soon turns out they they are armed robbers and very violent ones at that. They want to go down river so that they might escape the police and live on the spoils of their heist.The horror of this movie comes out with the dominance that these men have over the family. They are in the stituation where they have absolutely no choice but to follow the orders of these men. Everything that they try to do fails because these men are both armed and physically stronger than the others. The husband is an architect who is on his first rafting adventure, and the wife, though she is quite fit physically, is incapable of fighting the men. Thus they must bow to these men's every demand or face the consequences.In true Hollywood fashion, they defeat the bad guys and none of the good guys die. The dog escapes and the husband, who flees in the night, narrowly misses being shot. In the end this movie is thin on theme and plot. The men are suspicious right from the start as they look rough and are very impatient. They begin friendly but behave in a way the is quite unfriendly. This is a horror because we, living in a world where we believe in our freedom, do not want it taken away from us, and in this situation the men have done that. They live by no law and serve nobody. They are unpredictable and dangerous. Still, I was not scared and found the movie reasonable. The journey through the Gauntlet at the end of the movie is the best part and it is worth seeing for that only.

Curtis Hanson's The River Wild lives up to the challenge, even for someone who knows a thing or two about going down rivers like these (albeit not as violent).Storywise, it's pretty much your stock story from the genre A family with a crumbling marriage goes on a trip where they meet up with some seemingly nice people who turn out to be criminals of some sort. That's the story in a nutshell. What elevates this story from being routine is a smart script and terrific performances.There are two reasons in which The River Wild is more successful than the other members of the genre (not counting the performances), and both have to do with Denis O'Neill's script. One, he knows the ins and outs of whitewater rafting down a river and uses it to his advantage, and two, he has an intricate knowledge of family dynamics. By themselves each one of these qualities would elevate the project, but together they make it great. And it helps that Curtis Hanson's direction compliments the script nicely.Meryl Streep may have top billing, but while she is excellent in the quiet scenes, she's less impressive as when she turns into the action heroine. She seems miscast in an action movie, and unfortunately that's what she does for most of the movie. Still, she's not bad. And in the quieter scenes, she shines as only Meryl Streep can. To her credit, she has excellent chemistry with her costars, especially her on-screen husband, David Strathairn. Their conflict is a routine one (she's the wife while he's the workaholic husband), but the script explores this conflict in a deeper and more refreshing way, and both Streep and Stratharin are both so endearing that it works better than one could have hoped.Kevin Bacon is the real scene stealer here. His performance as Wade is top-notch. He's charming in the beginning, and creepy later on. He has perfect chemistry with young Joeseph Mazzello as Streep's son, Rourke. He's charming enough that the audience has no trouble believing that Rourke would be won over by Wade, especially because he acts like any child in his position would act. And he's very creepy later on, but loses none of his charm. Before seeing the movie, I thought John C. Reilly would have been miscast, but this role just shows his range and versatility.The River Wild isn't perfect, but when it comes to an adventure movie, this is a great trip.

But Streep keeps it on course","Date":"1 August 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Crime","Review":" The River Wild is a film that's definitely inspired by that infamous backwoods survivalist tale Deliverance. But its not the carbon copy it first appears. Its got more depths than that. First off, it was directed by Curtis Hanson, and he always manages to incorporate much needed intelligence into any scenario. This is the man who directed the classic LA Confidential, one of the most superb attempts at modern film-noir I've ever seen. And secondly, his direction is nearly always first-rate. And so it is here.Gail (Meryl Streep) is a teacher for the deaf who takes her family on a white water rafting trip for her son's birthday. Not only a holiday, but its also an opportunity to help smooth over relations between her husband Tom (David Strathairn) and her son Roarke (Jurassic Park's Joseph Mazzello). Tom's a workaholic who has just about destroyed any chance of having a relationship with his son.This family is on the brink of flying apart. What they need is a good crisis to bring them back together. And the screenplay by Denis O'Neill has just the thing. While heading downriver, Gail & Co come across two strangers, Wade & Terry (Kevin Bacon & John C. Reilly). Saying they lost their guide, they need Gail's help to get down the river.Of course naturally these two men are not what they seem. And it isn't long before the family's travelling companions take them all hostage. Because they're really a couple of bank robbers, and they need Gail to get them through the Gauntlet, a treacherous set of rapids, the only sure way to escape from the law.As is usually the case with any of Curtis Hanson's films, his direction is excellent. And he keeps the plot moving so quickly that you hardly have time to notice any glaringly obvious plot holes. But they are there.The Gauntlet is supposed to be the only way to get down the river. But much later in the film, Tom manages to escape, and he gets around the Gauntlet on foot. Why can't the family do the same? Because it would be a pretty limp ending that's why.Still, for any shortcomings the film might have, it more than makes up for that in its performances. The River Wild is not exactly a stretch for an actress of Meryl Streep's talents. She could do this kind of part in her sleep, and she deserves some credit for not coasting her way through the role. She allows a wonderful range of emotions to play out over her beautifully expressive face. Which is what makes her such an effortlessly engaging screen presence. And she's up to the strenuous scenes too. She could give Sigourney Weaver a run for her money.The one other actor in the film that vies with Streep for impressive screen time is Kevin Bacon as the sleazy Wade. And its quite an interesting role. Instead of the gun-toting lunatic that would have been so much easier to play, Wade becomes almost like a perverse sort of father figure. Roarke doesn't get along with his dad, but gets along great with Wade. Wade enjoys spending time with Roarke. He gives him plenty of attention. As well as lavishing some on Gail too. Something that doesn't escape Tom's notice.Its quite a nicely modulated performance on Bacon's part. He's always been an actor overdue worthwhile recognition. I'm not saying his work in The River Wild is Oscar worthy. But he delivers the goods. Alternately sinister and light. Like when he gets along with the wife and kids. And suddenly spooky like spying on Gail while she's bathing. The other performances are merely adequate. Tom gets to play a bit of an action hero. Climbing embankments. Swimming in the river. Amusingly he never loses his glasses. Even when he's getting knocked around. Terry is only Wade's sidekick. And that's about it really for him. And Roarke is just the obnoxious brat who gets them into trouble.The River Wild is Curtis Hanson's first attempt at an action film. And he does quite well. The film's ultimate setpiece is the Gauntlet. And its a thrilling 10 minutes. Crashing waves. Dizzying camera angles. All shot with a real immediacy. And the sight of giant rocks coming right at you is terrifying. I'm not sure where those scenes were really filmed but special commendation should go to the filmmakers, actors and stunt doubles for putting themselves at such great risk.The River Wild is not Curtis Hanson's finest hour. That honour goes to LA Confidential. And some of the film's plot points are a little contrived. But it delivers a quite rousing adventure. And it may put you off any white water rafting trips in the future.

She takes her family, one day, to a rafting trip down the river, but she has no idea that the planned trip is about to become a nightmare.Two escaping robbers with a handgun, meet the family in the way, and join them to the trip.Only later Gail realises that their new friends are dangerous criminals, but it's too late.The two men force them to stay together, and to keep cruising down the river.The family's life are risked not only by the two men, but also by the river which becomes more stormy and wilder....Thefirst thing that you notice about this movie is that it's the first time since 'Aliens' that a woman has taken the lead in a Hollywood action movie. Streep is an odd choice, but as the heroine, she really brings a vulnerability to her character which makes her wholly believable.The story isn't up to much, but thanks to such good direction and brilliant rapid sequences, this becomes more than an average thriller.Bacon is as sinister as needed, but he too has his vulnerable side. Sub plots involving marriage break ups and Benjamin Bratt are an added bonus, and Joseph Mazello proves he wasn't a one trick pony in Jurassic park, he's just as annoying in this.It's a shame it's not a well remembered movie, because it is a thrilling movie with some wonderful performances.

From A to Z, this intense adventure thriller holds one's breath tight with its suspenseful aura and splendid river torrent scenes, however the throwaway adrenalin-thrusting doesn't guarantee the same amount aftertaste, there are a touch indelible plot-holes emerging into my mind, which I assure you it is not a pleasant feeling (still, it's much better than most annoying pop-corn movies which I cannot even fluently commit myself to the moment). Meryl proves once again that she is the most versatile actress if not in the world, at least in Hollywood. The sports/action area is a rare attempt, yet she did most of her stunts, which is surely not able to be learnt from acting classes I suppose.With respect to the fore-mentioned skin-deep kernel, I have a hunch that both feminist and non-feminist would feel offended on account of in one hand the female protagonist's tough prevalence over her husband would exasperate man's ego, in the other hand, the inward- for-no-reason husband eventually resurrected his role-model father/husband image would be too obvious to feel empathetic (especially after a ludicrous rescue ploy). Poor David Strathairn, he had tried his best to save this badly-designed character. As for poor Kevin Bacon, he has been vying for an Oscar nomination since then, still in vain. (I would have taken Susan Sarandon's nomination for THE CLIENT to Meryl and also given one to the viciously- charming Kevin Bacon).

In theory, its plot doesn't sound especially promising, but in practice it works reasonably... if you give yourself (and the movie) a chance, of course.Mostly this is adventure, but there is acceptable amount of suspense and thriller. Plus, the ending (to be more precise, the last 20 minutes or so) is a roller-coaster of intensity, thanks to the breathtaking (and very dangerous!) rafting scenes in the most fierce part of the river.Overall, this is a decent Summer movie - good to be watched anytime of the year, but particularly in hot weather.True, the plot has a certain lack of strength but it's still okay. Besides, the beautiful cinematography compensates any plot flaws. That alone makes this movie attractive and refreshing to the eyes and mind.Kevin Bacon makes a convincing lead bad guy. Meryl Streep, despite her versatility, isn't often seen in this genre of movies (at least I don't remember so), which makes this movie a different attempt for her. Her performance isn't as solid as in 'Kramer vs Kramer', but she still makes it fine.Joseph Mazzello, as usual, is fine.

The hero is the river and the nature it crosses, the gorges and the rapids and the falls. And you will go down the river in a light boat. Beautiful indeed. Then the film sets a plot on that river of a nice vacationing family held hostage by the surviving thieves of a cattle auction robbery who try to escape the police after the robbery by using the river and the expertise of the mother of this family. This adds some family tension with a father who is working too hard as an architect and neglecting, in a way, his family, and yet he will save his wife and his son from the grip of the thieves after having escaped them before. Courage, for sure, tenacity definitely. And the beauty of this river all over and always.

Wade (Kevin Bacon) as the bad guy scared me because you would never know what he would do next, even though he mostly focused on getting out and being cleared of trouble then killing a lot of people, like some guy on a rampage and his sidekick Terry (John C.

The unfortunate thing about it is that these are only the last 15 minutes or so. Up to that point what we have is a pretty slow moving river journey, with the added complication, of course, being that the troubled family on the trip finds more trouble as they pick up a couple of guys who robbed the local cattle auction. In the end the movie turns out to be pretty formulaic, with movements and plot points that we've definitely seen before - many times, in fact.Meryl Streep was an interesting choice as Gail - mother and white water guide - and while she was interesting (basically because this isn't what you'd think of as a normal Meryl Streep role) I didn't find her convincing in the part, either (which is probably why it's not a normal Meryl Streep role!) Kevin Bacon was somewhat more credible as Wade, the guy apparently in charge of the robbery, who decides to take the family hostage in order to use Gail's rafting expertise to run a particularly deadly river in the hopes of escaping the law. Along for the ride were David Strathairn as Gail's husband, John C. Reilly as Wade's sidekick and Joseph Mazzello as young Roarke, Gail's son.It's a decent enough cast. The story isn't especially original, though, and I just didn't find the movie to be all that exciting. Watching a rafting trip (which is essentially what we do for the bulk of this movie) with a few bits of drama thrown in as we become gradually more suspicious of the two strangers doesn't exactly make for a gripping two hours of viewing. There is, of course, the requisite ending as it seems that all the family's troubles are solved by having gone through this adventure together.

Thus the plot's incredible contrivances and its other shortcomings (Meryl Streep as a champion whitewater rafter...PLEEZ!) became glaringly obvious.  I was unexpectedly disappointed in the normally reliable Jerry Goldsmith's score, succumbing to the turgid grandiosity of too many film composers these days...trying to take advantage of digital THX sound systems, perhaps?Anyway I watched it through to the bitter end in order for that final gratifying moment when Meryl shoots Kevin Bacon, loathsomely and all-too-convincingly playing a murderous villain.

The use of music throughout dispels any atmosphere of natural terror, and the ordeals that the characters have had to endure until this point are such that although the preceding plot has attempted to prepare us for what is to come, it in fact overshadows it, and the sense of the falls as a place of incomparable terror is thus dissipated.
