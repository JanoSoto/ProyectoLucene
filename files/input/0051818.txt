[{"Title":"Never be the same again...","Date":"13 January 2001","Score":"36 out of 39 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir","Review":"  To a lot of critics and non-fans of the Master of Song or King of Rock 'n' Roll, to give him his correct title, Elvis Presley was merely a wooden celluloid freak who just sang to children, animals, and everybody's Grandmother on a movie set. That might have been the case during the mid-'60's when Elvis didn't know how to perform on a movie set any other way than to follow the less than mediocre script which was getting more tedious and morose as the previous one. This trend was set by the formula that started with G.I. Blues and finally reaffirmed with the classic, Blue Hawaii, from then on in with the exception of Flaming Star, it was a pretty poor rag-bag bunch. However, King Creole was Elvis' jewel in the crown. The film is a testimony to a time when rebellion amongst teenage life was coming to the fore and the struggle for a young person's individuality in society was a constant threat to many parents of the 1950's genre. If Elvis was to be a big movie star this is the one that certainly went a step further than Jailhouse Rock to ascertain that position. Elvis' acting improved over the three film period of 1956-57, and in King Creole you can see the transition. He brings to the screen all the grittiness, excitement, tension that his character, Danny Fisher, is all about. This great quality movie really pays justice to a classic piece of film making by Director Michael Curtiz and a great supporting cast that Elvis gained so much from performing with in this story. Another transition also happens in this movie and that is one of the music. Apparently, Elvis never really liked Jazz music, but he certainly forgot all about that when he cut the soundtrack to this movie. I'm sure that Jazz music featured slightly higher on his list after he realised what he could do in the studio with this kind of music and blending it with his own rock rythmns and blues orientations. To me, this is one of the greatest films ever made, by one of the most underrated actors of our time. To the critics and non-fans alike Watch it and Weep!

Its only when he worked with talented directors such as Michael Curtiz and Don Siegal that his abilities as an actor were fully used. King Creole(1958) is such a film where he is given the chance to act and he passes with flying colors.  King Creole(1958) and the western, Charro(1968) are my two favorite Elvis Presley films because of their dark tone and the excellent acting performances by Elvis.  One of the better directed Elvis films by veteran filmmaker and Casablanca(1942) director, Michael Curtiz. One of the people who wrote the story was Michael V.

Elvis considered this melodrama his best film and I happen to agree. It's nicely photographed in noirish black and white and directed by Michael Curtiz, featuring Elvis' most cultivated performance. It's a good story too, complimented by good actors in their roles. Walter Matthau is ideal as Maxie the heavy, who practically owns the whole town. Carolyn Jones is properly pitiful as his pathetic tramp, and Vic Morrow does well as the lead hoodlum who caters to Matthau. The songs Presley sings fit nicely into the action and are pleasant, though I don't believe any of them were signature biggies for Presley outside of, possibly, Hard Headed Woman, and King Creole itself. It's a real shame that the best hit rocker, Hard Headed Woman, is really given a raw deal as we only get to hear the end of it within the movie. The best music performance is Elvis' rendition of Trouble as he dominates the nightclub stage with authority and toughness while fearlessly singing it at Maxie. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"To Watch 'King Creole' is to See the Light","Date":"9 August 2003","Score":"14 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir","Review":"  I had an epiphany tonight. 'King Creole' is a better film than 'Jailhouse Rock'. 'Jailhouse' may contain King's best acting but 'King Creole' is his best film. Why? I would say King's acting is only slightly less convincing in 'Creole' but two things make it a better film the cast and the story. 'King Creole' boasts the finest cast by far of any Presley film. Only Ann-Margret is sexier than Carolyn Jones, Vic Morrow has that ferocious mouth, Dean Jagger is almost perfect as the beaten father and Walter Matthau is deliciously vile. Harold Robbins' novel 'A Stone for Danny Fisher' is gritty and at times hard to read. Although the screenplay (co-written by 'Frankie Five-Angels', Michael V. Gazzo) is quite a bit more tame it is still tough. Think about it King plays a character who kills a man in an alley with a switchblade. Here he is not 'Jailhouse Rock's amoral Vince Everett. Instead he is, at times, IMmoral. Forget all you think you know about the icon, Elvis Presley, and watch his eyes when, as Danny Fisher, he tells his father 'you go to school. I'm goin' out to make a buck'. If you don't see it, if you don't see IT, you're just not looking.

After this movie I think is when all his movies were just made to make money, which they ALL did. Elvis unfortunately became a joke in comparison to other actors all because of the terrible scripts. There was one movie (can't remember which one, there were over 30) in which he reportedly told the director after filming was done Hey nice movie, maybe I'll read the script sometime . In other words, Elvis hated the fact that he wasn't getting good scripts. He was the first real money making star which is what ultimately lead to the atrocious film roles. Well except for maybe 4 or 5 of his films. Anyway if you never saw Elvis in a movie before (which I find hard to believe with all the Elvis marathons on tv), see this one!

I have no doubt that the Colonel got him Michael Curtiz as a director and a top flight supporting cast consisting of Oscar winners like Dean Jagger as the King's father and Walter Matthau as the villain of the piece. And other such outstanding players as Carolyn Jones, Vic Morrow, Paul Stewart, and Dolores Hart. Presley steps into James Dean territory here, had he lived I'm sure Dean would have played the part of Danny Fisher in what would have been a non-musical story or one where Dean's singing would have been dubbed. Danny Fisher is just the kind of troubled youth searching for himself that Dean excelled with in East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause. In fact in the relationship between Presley and Jagger you can see a lot of the dynamics of Dean's and Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause.Elvis has had to go to work because his father has been unable to hold down a job ever since the death of his wife. So's Elvis's sister, Jan Shepard, also had to work. He gets a break in Walter Matthau's club with an impromptu audition, but it's rival owner Paul Stewart who hires Elvis. That sets the stage for a lot of the action to come.For those who are used to seeing Walter Matthau as the lovable grouch starting from The Odd Couple it would surprise many to learn most of his early roles were bad guys. He's an exceptionally nasty bad guy in King Creole.The title song became one of Elvis's early best sellers and it is also the name of the club Matthau owns in the New Orleans French Quarter. Presley has some other good numbers in this film as well.Some other reviewers have mentioned that Elvis should have done more dramatic stuff like King Creole. Maybe he should have, who knows. But I think the point should be made is that first and foremost Elvis was a singing icon, not an acting one. As were the idols of former generations Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. I don't think Elvis was willing to push himself as player in the same way they were. Neither Crosby or Sinatra also had a manager with as tight a control over them creatively as Colonel Tom Parker. Both Crosby and Sinatra got Oscars, but it was for parts that they knew they could handle and went after, especially Sinatra. Maybe Elvis in the words of another icon, knew his limitations or the Colonel did.King Creole also was one of the first of Harold Robbins's novels to be made into a film. Yet it's never thought of as a Robbins film like The Carpetbaggers or The Betsy. It's an Elvis film, first and foremost.And that's good enough for fans of the King and others.

I'm not trying to knock him, in most of his films he's an enjoyable presence but except for Wild in the Country and this none of them required much in the way of stretching his ability.While he is memorable in the lead there are several other factors that help make this such a strong picture. Chief among them is the presence of the master of any genre Curtiz in the director's chair lending his firm hand to keep the film focused and compelling. Something else that adds to this is the cast. Elvis usually was supported by one sometimes two strong veteran actors or actresses but here the film is loaded to the rafters with talent. Walter Matthau, Dean Jagger, Paul Stewart, Vic Morrow and Dolores Hart all contribute strongly to the texture of the film with best in show honors going to Carolyn Jones as a fragile, damaged woman with a good heart. It's a standard role but she makes something quite lovely out of it.

Gazzo who was then still fresh from the Broadway success of A HATFUL OF RAIN (later filmed by Fred Zinnemann in 1957) but is nowadays perhaps best-known for his Oscar-nominated performance in THE GODFATHER PART II (1974).Elvis is backed by a rather stellar cast once again, lovely Dolores Hart is featured as his love interest ‚Äì when he‚Äôs not being ensnared by long-suffering gangster‚Äôs moll Carolyn Jones, which doesn‚Äôt sit at all well with vicious kingpin Walter Matthau (effectively cast as the sleek heavy of the piece); the older generation is represented by Dean Jagger, appearing as Elvis‚Äô submissive pharmacist father and Paul Stewart playing the owner of the ‚ÄúKing Creole‚Äù establishment (who eventually hitches up with Presley‚Äôs older sister) and the only one who‚Äôs unafraid to stand up to Matthau‚Äôs control of the territory and who signs up ‚Äúbusboy‚Äù/failed graduate Elvis when he‚Äôs revealed to be a talented singer.

Three years earlier when his mom died, his pharmacist dad (Dean Jagger) became a borderline bum so Danny had to work mornings before school, and evenings after school to earn money for him and dad and his sister Mimi (Jan Shepard). He was supposed to graduate from high school the prior year, but instead had to repeat his senior year. A hot head, he found it hard to turn the other cheek, and as a result was always in some sort of scrape it seemed.This was Elvis' 4th movie, and made right before he was drafted into the Army at age 22. Although much of the movie has a staged feel to it, Elvis does a credible job, and his singing is featured when he gets a job in a New Orleans FrenchQuarter night spot. A somewhat young Walter Matthau, doing a decent Bogart impression, plays the heavy, Maxie Fields, who always bends the rules, often breaking them, to get his way. Carolyn Jones, who later was popular on the TV series The Addams Family is good as Ronnie, who belongs to Maxie but longs for Danny. Dolores Hart, who left the movies and became a nun just a few years later, was 19 here playing Nellie, the good girl that falls for Danny too.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Danny's first scrape in this movie comes in the morning before his last day of school, cleaning up at a night spot, two men are bothering Ronnie, so he breaks a bottle for defense, and gets her into a taxi and out of there. At school some guys tease him for kissing her and Danny punches him out. The school decides to fail him again, no graduation! Discouraged he vows to get a job, he's had enough of school.Charlie LeGrand, who owned a night spot called the 'King Creole' and was a rival of Maxie's, heard Danny and offered him a job singing for $85 a week. Meanwhile dad went back to work as a pharmacist, and one rainy night taking the day's money to the bank was mugged by 'Shark' (Vic Morrow) who worked for Maxie. Dad ended up in the hospital for 4 weeks but recovered. Maxie tried to blackmail Danny into working for him but Danny beat him up instead and went on the run. A knife fight in the alley and 'Shark' was dead. Injured, Danny was taken by Ronnie to her hide away near the lake. Maxie finds them, is gunning for them, hits Ronnie, but 'Dummy' whom Danny had treated nicely before runs and tackles Maxie, who shoots himself while falling into the water. Mortally wounded, Ronnie dies in Danny's arms on the wooden walkway. Which leaves Danny and Nellie to each other.

Ask anyone in my generation who the King of Rock n' Roll was and you'll get the best description of an impersonator with gargantuan sideburns, white bedazzled suit and an exaggerated Southern drawl. I know because I thought that was what I was going to get in King Creole Hmmm, okay, an Elvis movie. Sure, why not? No other expectations besides a vague thought it would probably be nothing great. I ended up watching it three times and liking it more and more.Elvis plays Danny Fisher, a 19-year-old who juggles time between school and busboy job to help make ends meet for himself, his sister and his incompetent father. Mr. Fisher's bankrupt pharmacy following his wife's death has resulted in the small family moving to the poor French Quarter of New Orleans, where rich mobsters like Maxie Fields operate. Saving Danny from a criminal career after failing graduation for a second time is Charlie LeGrand, the owner of the respectable but small King Creole nightclub, who hires Danny as a singer. Trouble ensues when Danny's previous boss Fields plots to trap him into singing at his joint instead, using call-girl Ronnie and eventually Mr. Fisher as bait.I was surprised how capable the entire cast was - even Elvis, who here is the realistic youth who has to cope with a world of troubles surrounding his existence. Walter Matthau's Maxie Fields is properly bad, downright slimy even, and Carolyn Jones's Ronnie has that perfect balance of pathetic angst and bitter view of the past. Dean Jagger is the failing father to the letter, and Vic Morrow's smarmy Shark makes me want to beat him up. Dolores Hart, who starred with Elvis in Loving You, again plays the nice girl who is almost embroiled in the vague and dark happenings in the French Quarter. The gritty atmosphere is beautifully punctuated by the stark black and white film noir format (a pity they don't bring it back, film noir was such an art form).Anyone who doubts Elvis's capacity for acting should see this one. Since King Creole I've gone on to watch every one of his movies - yes, all 31, and each one TWICE - and now understand some of the stigma against Elvis as actor. What people should understand is that most of them contained almost every ingredient that ensured a horrible film bad, greedy, controlling manager (the notorious POS Col. Parker), bad director (Norman Taurog, who else?), bad/cheap scriptwriters (too many), bad camera personnel and the bad songs (who wrote them?). Out of all 31, I'd say one-third of that could be called very good or watchable - Jailhouse Rock, Follow That Dream, Flaming Star particularly - but King Creole is hands-down the BEST.

King Creole has a great cast, great acting, a solid script and many interesting musical numbers, not to mention excellent cinematography. Without all this, it might have just been another Elvis vehicle. Look at the list of Curtiz' movies -- Yankee Doodle Dandee, Casablanca, Mission to Moscow, to name three in a row -- can you find a more versatile director? I don't think there is any Curtiz style; each is unique, in each he fits the movie to the material. His work begins in the silent era, 1912, yet King Creole epitomizes the 1950s. And Curtiz, 72, knows how to showcase the talent and energy of Elvis, presenting him as an artist. Yes, Elvis can act. There isn't a wrong note anywhere, and it is a relatively complex role. I suppose the next question the studios would have asked is whether he had the depth to play a wide range of characters. Could Elvis transform himself into someone else? That is great acting. I'm thinking of someone like Paul Newman -- or Walter Matthau. Elvis never got a chance to find out. Perhaps the studios looked at King Creole and decided not to push their luck and stick to the Elvis persona?To do good acting you need a good cast to react off of, and he had it here. We see some real chemistry and sparks flying as they interact with Elvis. Here is Matthau at his finest. This is no mobster don caricature; we see cruelty and cunning, but also rays of kindness and genuine appreciation for Elvis' talent. And who would guess that Ronnie -- Carolyn Jones -- was also Morticia in the Addams Family or Julie Rawlings in How the West was Won? I am not a big Elvis fan, though I do respect the emotional energy of his style. Those who are not familiar with Elvis should watch King Creole to understand why he was so influential.At first I was disappointed that there wasn't a broader range of musical styles displayed, given the title King Creole and the fact that Elvis's musical roots are in the black jazz and blues of Memphis, Tennessee. It appeared to be all all high octane Elvis. But then I looked closer and realized that Elvis' musical roots are, indeed, on display in the movie. Even in the slower numbers, the Elvis intensity just made them seem high octane.The only Creole influence is seen in the opening number of street vendors calling out their wares, Crawfish, similar to the Street Cries number in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. But it does set up the musical environment.The first performance number, Trouble, shows Elvis singing with a Dixieland group, but it is actually a solid blues number in a style similar to T-Bone Walker (Stormy Monday). Now this is Elvis' roots. The closest to a slow love ballad is Lover Doll in the Five and Dime, accompanied only by a bass. The closest to jazz is New Orleans, which starts slow like W.C. Handy, and shows a connection between Elvis' style and jazz, including a banjo and some Dixieland riffs. In the number King Creole, the only connection to the movie's title aside from the club's name, we see typical Elvis energy and tempo, but also some of the blues and jazz roots we saw more clearly in earlier numbers. Later, we have a somewhat gratuitous Dixieland Rock, which sounds a lot like Jailhouse Rock, and is closer to pure Elvis than most numbers here. The distinctive double clapping by Elvis that sets up the number, echoed by the band, corresponds to the sound of a car driving over a loose manhole cover. If you'd ever lived with one outside your window, you would recognize it. Don't Ask Me Why is a slow number in the style of many Fifties pop songs, and a takeoff of O Sole Mio, an old Italian song that's seen many permutations, including Elvis' later It's Now or Never.What stands out, at least to the modern listener, is the high energy, fast beat Elvis style that became so famous. But actually Curtiz does a good job of mixing styles and tempos, and of providing a sort of chronology of musical influences on Elvis in the various numbers. The range could have been a bit broader, but this was 1958 and the movie was helping to establish Elvis' musical identity. The influence of black jazz and blues is there to the observant viewer, but not fully highlighted. This was the Fifties, and displaying too much black influence would have been risky. What we do see was a actually a bold move (though setting it in New Orleans makes it more acceptable), and probably enhanced Elvis' edgy, bad boy image with the teenagers and James Dean crowd. (Now, if they had made Elvis' role truly Creole, part black and part French, that would have been ballsy for the time.)I suppose you could say the best Elvis movie is the one that was never made, the mature actor singing in a broad range of styles rock, jazz, blues, creole and ballads. It's too bad he didn't return to his musical roots in later years, as well as acting. But King Creole comes surprisingly close to providing Elvis' musical testament.

Carolyn Jones, well before the Addams Family, plays the gangsters girl and she looks pretty good and acts well. The family dynamics of Elvis's screen family, the Fisher's, is a little weird.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the visual style and story progress (based on a novel) was quite good and rewarding. Jones really re-defines a femme fatale role and as a male viewer I was touched by the pathos she brings to the 'Ronnie' character. Jaegger as the pathetic father-figure is also excellent and is touching in his scenes w/ Elvis and Matthau. I think I liked Morrow the best. His 'Shark' is a tragic character with his soulless eyes that just tell you his life will get cut short. The director conveys a good sense of atmosphere especially towards the end when Jones and Elvis are hiding in her cabin. The sequence as Elvis emerges from inside and joins Jones as she opens herself up to him personally is dynamite in lieu of the fact that Matthau will soon shatter the almost-lover's brief tranquility.My only dislike is the tacked on 'happy ending' which is out of place w/ the rest of the gritty New Orleans ghetto story.

Gazzo from the novel A Stone for Danny Fisher written by Harold Robbins. It stars Elvis Presley, Carolyn Jones, Walter Matthau, Dolores Hart, Dean Jagger, Vic Morrow, Paul Stewart and Jan Shepard. Music is scored by Walter Scharf and cinematography by Russell Harlan. Plot finds Presley as Danny Fisher, a high school student struggling at school who falls in with the wrong crowd just as family matters of the heart start to take a hold.He said anybody that disagreed with you got a punch in the mouth. Is that what I brought you up to do, to fight?The last film Presley made before going off to do his service in the army, King Creole is his best film. It's one of only a small handful that showed the star actually had some acting ability, here he gets a top director to work under and a very tidy cast put along side him for him to respond too. Presley immediately warmed to Curtiz (Casablanca/Mildred Pierce), wilfully doing as he was told by the wily old director, rewarding the film fan with a performance of some merit. Presley would often say it was his personal favourite of his own films, and it's not hard to see why. Though packed with musical numbers, many of them belters as well, the film always stays dramatic, in fact the tunes form part of the narrative, they are not frothy interludes slotted in purely for fan appeasement.Everything he touches turns to drink.It's not unreasonable to expect King Creole to be a fun movie, the kind where Elvis flies a plane, speeds around on power boats, or saves the word during a treasure hunt, because the poster art and DVD covers lend you to think that. Honestly, one shows the King with guitar wrapped around him, hips bent and a huge smile on his face, the other has the same Elvis pose but along side him is a smiling beauty bedecked in a banana patterned dress! I mean really, would you think this film is shot in moody black and white, features murders, theft, family upheaval, drunks, knife fights, wasted life and all round dirty tricks? That the King is snarly, aggressive and channelling Jim Stark from Rebel Without a Cause? Because all these things reside within this potent and most agreeable Elvis picture.Now you know. That's how you get into it.With the drama relocated from the New York of the novel to Bourbon Street New Orleans, and Danny Fisher changed from a boxer to a singer, atmosphere needed to be tight to the emotionally battered story. And it is, very much so, with Harlan (Ramrod/Riot in Cell Block 11) doing a great job of making The Big Easy come off as The Big Seedy. This is a world of back alleys where hoodlum youths dwell and of wet tinged streets barely lit by gas lamps, many of the night scenes shot here are worthy of film noir status, with a rain sodden mugging sequence truly top of the line. Conversely Curtiz also paints a bustling Orleans picture, with song clubs and street sellers proving to be the heartbeat of the city. It's a twin viewpoint of Orleans that matches other duality themes that drive the narrative forward, because Danny is caught between two girls and two night club owners.Cast are very good across the board, with Matthau menacing, Morrow weasel like, Jagger and Jones sad and pitiful, Stewart elegantly honest and Hart doing a neat line in confused love. Stand out tunes include the title song, Hard Headed Woman, Trouble, Steadfast Loyal and True, Lover Doll and the quite beautiful As Long As I Have You. It's not perfect, serious crime goes unpunished, the main motive driving on Matthau's club boss is rather weak and the two love interest girls are written lazily as love sick puppies. Yet this is still a cracker of a movie, where Presley bristles with magnetism and emotional conflict and Curtiz and Harlan rack up the requisite amount of impressive atmospheric visuals. 8/10 "},{"Title":"King Elvis","Date":"13 July 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir","Review":" King Creole (1958) Starring Elvis Presley, Walter Matthau, Carolyn Jones, Dolores Hart, Dean Jagger, Lilian Montevechi, Vic Morrow, Paul Stewart, Jan Shepard, Brian G. Hutton, Jack Grinnage, Dick Winslow, Raymond Bailey, Leon Tyler...Direcor Michael Curtiz...Screenplay Herbert Baker, Based On The Novel By Harold Robbins By 1958, when this film was released, there was not a single American (unless they were Amish or lived in a cave) who didn't know who Elvis Presley was. The popular singer's albums sold fast and his concerts and performances in Las Vegas and on TV drove dozens of young teenage girls crazy. He fancied himself an actor as well or he opted to make movies to cater to his fans. Back then if you wanted to see Elvis shake his waist and hips (which you couldn't see on TV because of censorship)you could see it if you went to see his movies. Director Michael Curtiz was a fine director with great films (better than this one) to his credit- Santa Fe Trail (1940) The Sea Hawk (1940) and of course his masterpiece Casablanca (1942). The director of Casablanca was a noted Hollywood moviemaker and to engage Elvis in a film must have been awfully good for his career. In King Creole, he plays Danny Fisher a New Orleans rebel, the son of a well-to-do and respectable politician (or something like that) who flunks out of high school and decides to sing in nightclubs instead. His father wants him to marry the wealthy and sweet Nel (Dolores Hart)and to change his life for the better. But in his nightclub, Danny discovers a seedy world of corruption and danger. He encounters the beautiful, seemingly comfortable but unhappy Ronnie (Carolyn Jones) the sweetheart of a powerful mob lord. He's drawn to her on an emotional and physical level but he's torn between both his own sweetheart and Ronnie. A young Walter Matthau plays mob lord Maxie Field, with a degree of nastiness and abusive dominance, fueled by alcoholism. There are songs but this is not a musical. The songs are featured in the appropriate scenes in which Danny sings in the nightclub. This was a style of movies that Elvis did at the time although he was also in musicals. But this is one film in which he attempted to act. For fans of Elvis, he's wonderful in this role which suits him but I personally don't think he's much of an actor and he was the first celebrity to prove that singers should not transition into film acting. Later on, singers like Madonna would do the same thing in the 80's and 90's and fail miserably. But this type of a film is a time capsule of the 50's and therefore has value. Elvis would do several films in color in the 60's as well but quit after he began to age visibly. Carolyn Jones is his leading lady in this film. Sadly, she's not a well-known actress. She is known only for her role as Morticia Addams in the memorable and much loved TV comedy series The Addams Family (1964-1966). Give this woman some credit. She was an outstanding actress with tons of films and TV series in her resume. Here, she is subtle next to the more dramatic Elvis but she shows moments of angst in a very dramatic, sort of soap-opera-ish way. She's really good. Her voice is especially essential in her acting and it helped that she was very beautiful. This is a lovely film with an emotional core and with lots of great singing, especially the last song.

Danny becomes a nightclub singer at New Orleans dive 'The King Creole' and turns the joint into the hottest club on Bourban Street, much to the annoyance of rival nightclub owner and local mobster Maxi Fields (Matthau) who attempts several underhand tactics to get Danny to join HIS Club as the singer, including having Danny's father beaten up and hospitilized so that he can take care of the medical fees, get Danny onside while also have something over his head - for it was Danny's gang who performed the mugging. In the midst of it all, Danny is torn between two lovers (a typical theme for later Presley movies!) including young Delores Hart (his 'Loving You' co-star.) and Carolyn Jones - Maxi's unhappy girlfriend. The result of it all is a bloodied combat as Danny tries to battle his way -and Carolyn Jones way - out of the mob gang and the lifestyle, so that in the end he can return to the King Creole. Again this is not MY personal favourite Elvis movie, same as 'Loving You', despite their high regard...Presley won rave reviews for his performance and this was the kind of role he craved but would rarely get upon his return from the Army in 1960.

This movie takes on a more serious and dark tone. I've read a lot of other user reviews and critic reviews. Most of them praising Elvis' acting in this movie and I agree. Elvis is good in this movie, finally getting to stretch his acting chops in a more serious role. A shame that Elvis's agent was a total controlling idiot otherwise we may have seen some gold statues on Elvis' shelf. Elvis does sing and the songs are very nice but what's good is that the songs don't overshadow his acting.Even Walter Matthau praised his acting and was upset that he didn't get an Oscar nomination.Now on to the movie itself , while Elvis shines , the movie does not. It is very slow paced and the plot itself rather unbelievable. Elvis plays a young man who is trying to find his place in life after getting kicked out of high school for fighting so he wont graduate. He has a destitute father and has to work to support him. He is a busboy in a club owned by a mobster Maxie Fields(Walter Matthau) - he sings one night and the owner of the King Creole-Charlie LeGrand(Paul Stewart) likes his singing so he hires him to sing.Of course he's a smash and now Maxie wants him to come back and sing at his club ,pretty much a sing for me or else thing. Then subplots of Maxies floozy Ronnie played by Adams Familys Morticia(Carolyn Jones)and a waitress named Nellie(Dolores Hart) ensue along with some street tough gang fights. It seems rather unbelievable that a wealthy mobster who owns half the city of New Orleans would go to such great lengths over a nightclub singer. That's where it loses me , the mob after a guy just to get him to sing in their nightclub? I think the movie is more about the mob leader Maxie's jealousy than actually giving a hoot about Elvis working in his club. The gist I see is Maxie jealous of Elvis sexually -esp since he knows Ronnie is obviously attracted to Elvis so he wants to keep Elvis in his sights and also to let others know that he can have/buy anyone he wants. Also Ronnie used to work for Charlie until Maxie bought her out.Notice how he treats her, like crap. I just got bored once it turned into an If i cant have you then no one will type movie.

It gives it that real film noir feeling. It is a lot darker and more gritty than any other film Elvis made. Of all his movies, this was the one Elvis himself called his favorite. I can most definitely understand why. Not only was it directed by Michael Curtiz of Casablanca fame, but the script is sharp and Elvis also had some great co-stars to work with, particularly Walter Matthau who played local gangster, Maxie Fields in the film.Matthau is very effective as the primary villain of the story. Carolyn Jones as Ronnie and Delores Hart as Nellie serve as Elvis' two love interests in the movie. Vic Morrow plays Shark a street hustler and member of Fields' posse. As good as the supporting cast is, no one outshines Elvis as the star of this picture.2008 marks the 50th anniversary of the release of King Creole, and it truly is a must-have for any Elvis fan, I highly recommend it!

However, I heard that the movie king creole was originally made as a James dean movie to be about a boxer but, upon his tragic death the role was given to Elvis and changed to fit as so. Does anyone have any facts about this or is it just a rumor?? I heard from that ! guy on TMC on cable Robert Osbourn so, I don't know what to think. I think though that if it is true it would have been a hell of a movie still with James dean playing that role ( with the changes I listed above of course ). anyone who has information about this a response is greatly appreciated because i looked all over the net and i cannot find a thing, thanks, Dennis...

After seeing it, you can figure out why No silly plot lines that permeates many of his '60s pictures, no below-par songs to perform, some of the best actors Elvis had ever worked with, and perhaps the best director he ever worked under-the legendary Michael Curtiz. In fact, this was the last notable work of the, by then, nearly 40-year veteran of some of the most classic movies ever made like his Oscar-winning Casablanca. About the rest of the cast Dean Jagger, Vic Morrow, Dolores Hart (in her second Presley movie), and, especially, Carolyn Jones and Walter Matthau as the moll and her mobster lover are all excellent. And the musical performances of Elvis are perfectly staged especially on Trouble. The role he played here, Danny Fisher, is perhaps his most three-dimensional since it was supposed to go to James Dean before his untimely death. Also, as someone who's lived in Louisiana for a long time, I loved the New Orleans location shots presented here especially the beginning when we see various workers singing with Elvis joining in on a number called Crawfish. All in all, the best Presley movie I've seen so far and I've yet to see Flaming Star and Viva Las Vegas!

These films are embarrassingly bad, but in a very harmless way. They are so far removed from reality that watching one of these light-hearted films takes my mind off of my sorrows and into a pleasant, tuneful world that never existed, and never will exist.King Creole, as good as it is, is high melodrama, and high melodrama is not where I like to see Elvis.Then there is the presence of Walter Matthau. After seeing him in the many comedies he did in later years, it is very hard to take this extremely talented actor seriously. Although Matthau does a good job, knowledge of his comic abilities and watching his round-shouldered, slue-footed walk bring back memories not of the heel Maxie Fields that he plays in this film, but of the slovenly, sloppy, but lovable Oscar Madison in The Odd Couple, and The Odd Couple II. I give this pre-Clambake and pre-Odd Couple film an A for effort.The photography by Russell Harlan is magnificent.

Micheal Curtiz a great director of the 30s and 40s was skeptical at the Elvis casting which required the rewrite from a boxer to singer. But after production began he saw that one Elvis was a hard dedicated worker and two that he had acting talent. The story was at one time a James Dean possibility and Elvis must have been aware of it. The shame is he was not given more scripts and directors like this movie.

Elvis does the best acting of his career here as misunderstood youth Danny Fisher -- too bad they had to make him keep singing all the time, breaking up the flow of the story irreparably.  To the movie's credit, the music of New Orleans is integrated into the film's fabric from its opening moments -- I just think maybe they should've had Elvis sing 2 or 3 songs (in Flaming Star, Elvis sings one song and does not break up the atmosphere of the period film, which is quite effective).  The 5 or 6 songs he does sing end up inevitably slowing down the story too much.  Matthau is suprisingly convincing as a lethal mob boss determined to control Fisher's budding career (shades of the Colonel?), and Jones is fantastic as the femme fatale with a heart of gold who Elvis falls for.  Morrow is sharp as Matthau's crony who will do anything to please his boss (though his performances in these stock types were already growing a bit stale by 1958), and Jagger is perfect as the ineffectual father -- a part he would undoubtedly have played in the film if this had been made, as planned, with James Dean, and his chemistry with Dean would have been even more impressive than it is here with Elvis.  Every character has at least 3 sides -- one viscious, one scared, and the third hopeful or ambitious.Elvis noir par excellence!

Adapted from the Harold Robbins book A Stone for Danny Fisher, the movie transplants the action from Chicago to New Orleans and is now structured as an acting/singing vehicle for E.P. (here trying out his James Dean impression). Although certainly not terrible, the story fails to be intriguing, and the males in the supporting cast (Dean Jagger, Vic Morrow and the always-reliable Walter Matthau) outshine the women (Carolyn Jones and Dolores Hart), who are colorless. More grit was required, but film is still worth noting for Presley's appearance as well as his songs, the title tune and Trouble. ** from **** "},{"Title":"pre- Hal B.

Made (I believe) just before he was inducted into the Army, it's much, much, much, better than, for instance, 'Speedway', or 'Paradise Hawaiian Style'.Walter Matthau, Dean Jagger, and Carolyn Jones compliment Elvis (or maybe Elvis compliments them, actually) as, imagine this, a singer.  Black and white treatment adds a sinister element to the small amount of violence in the film, and the music (if you like Elvis, as I do) is superb.

And here he is playing the rebel James Dean just like everybody was in real life. And that was what everybody wanted to see, the real Elvis, our Elvis. Only he was better than James Dean just because he could sing like nobody else. And if everybody wanted to act like James Dean also everybody wanted to sing and look like Elvis. Among many other things in this movie the most outstanding element is naturally the music. And since the story is set in New Orleans the music is Dixie, but since this is Elvis it turned out to be dixie-rock and it sounds great. All the songs are complete (unlike the girl can't help it) and Elvis really rocks. Sadly to me this was the last time I saw the real ELVIS. Whoever came back from the army 2 years later was somebody else, but I'm happy that at least came back. A similar fate had most of the R&R idols from the 50's, only some never came back. Seems like the object was to kill R&R. So if you are looking for trouble, you came to the right place. I bet Michael Curtiz was a big fan of Elvis too.

You'll have to see for yourself, especially when you have read the book. If you didn't read the book, I suggest reading that book too, even if you've seen the movie first.
