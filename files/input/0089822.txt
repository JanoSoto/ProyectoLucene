So I couldn't resist, I had to see the sequels, but I was really nervous when I kept checking all the ratings for the sequels, they're all pretty low and below average. So I was expecting Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment to be absolutely bad, but actually I did laugh quite a bit. I admit this was below what the first one was with the laughs and the story, but I felt like it was a decent follow up with the first Police Academy movie. It was cool to see the old gang back together and just having fun like they did in the first film. The story is a little weak but it's still a lot of fun to watch and has some great laughs.A violent, well, um, if that's the right word, a violent gang has moved in on the town and are just making it into a havoc for anyone to live in. They are also making a mockery of the police, well, that's not too hard to do since they're pretty incompetent, so the chief wants a new team. He is given the class of '84, who haven't had any good jobs since they graduated, but now they are back together to get this gang out of town. At first they just end up screwing just as badly, but come together to be the best police force in town.Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment in my opinion is a fun movie, I think the 4.8 rating is a little harsh, I understand the low 5's, but I think the reason why is because it is a little less than the first Police Academy movie, now of course I would say to stick with the original for right now, but I wouldn't shy you away from the sequel. Anyone who says they didn't laugh once during this movie must be lying, because the scene where they put super glue in their Sergent's shampoo was beyond hilarious, it's a classic. So just go ahead and have fun with this movie, I think you'll enjoy it.5/10 "},{"Title":"Revenge of the 80's The multiple sequels.","Date":"9 January 2005","Score":"14 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Police Academy 2 (1985) was quickly rushed into production to capitalize upon the surprisingly successful first film. The recruits have finally graduated from the academy and are now assigned positions throughout the city. Crime is rampant and the people are afraid to leave their homes because of a local crime wave. A group of young punks (led by Bobcat Goldwait) have recently assaulted the chief of police (Howard Hesseman). With the city in turmoil and with his job being threatened by the Chief's right hand man, he turns to the new recruits to help clean up the city.I hate it when they franchise a movie and tone down the raunchy humor and crude manners, elements that made the first one a success. The movie is funny but it's not as good as the first film. Sadly the creativity and humor of the Police Academy films goes down the eventual slippery slope. By the fifth film the series becomes very unwatchable and extremely redundant. Even though it's a step down from the first film, it's still entertaining.Recommendx "},{"Title":"Their First Assignment, Give Us Plenty of Laughs","Date":"13 June 2009","Score":"9 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" After the Police Academy surviving the graduating class that these most unusual police cadets are in, the whole group is assigned by special request of Howard Hessemann brother of Academy Commandant George Gaynes to his precinct which has seen an outbreak of gang violence. Hessemann is looking for some new and idealistic recruits to help him out. Instead he gets these goofballs.If Steve Guttenberg learned Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect at the Academy it's all forgotten by him and his fellow graduates. They also get involved in departmental politics as second in command Art Metrano at the precinct wants this crew to foul up. And they do everything they can to oblige him.Police Academy movies are a guilty pleasure of mine. They can be described as gross, vapid, stupid, puerile, and funny as all hell.I'm so glad they wrote in George Gaynes into this film showing his graduates and how well they do in Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment. There is something downright lovable about the clueless Captain Lessard whom he plays. And Art Metrano is the kind of villain you just love to hate and you just love seeing how Guttenberg and the rest get back at him in their own little ways.The regulars are all there, Bubba Smith with that 6'7 inch frame of his, showing that size does indeed matter, Michael Winslow and that uncanny ability of sound effects, David Graf as Tackleberry who finds true love in this one with Colleen Camp. My favorite however is Marion Ramsey, little Officer Hooks with the squeaky voice. You can't help but love her.Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment may be the funniest of the series.

Not too mention that it grossed over 100 million dollars so a sequel is a must do for Hollywood. Let's face it, there was enough characters and ideas in this franchise to do a sequel, or six sequels as the case turned out to be. Nonetheless it made sense after showing all the cadets make it to graduation that we would get to see them on the job.Thus continues Police Academy Their First Assignment. Most of the original cast returns...Steve Guttenberg as Carey Mahoney, Bubba Smith, David Graf, Michael Winslow, Bruce Mahler, Marion Ramsey, and even George Gaynes in a more cameo type role as Cmdt. Eric Lassard. Guttenberg's Mahoney seems toned down in this sequel which is unfortunate. He doesn't show a lot of the smart-ass, prank playing personality that made the original so great. Everyone else plays their roles similar to that of the original so the jokes when it comes to the characters haven't changed a lot...just perhaps more of them. Michael Winslow as the noise making Larvell Jones is used far more in this one than in the original. Also at the forefront is Eugene Tackleberry who is a great character and he's a lot of fun and a great hero to watch. Sadly the film is noticeably missing G.W. Bailey, who plays Mahoney's perfect adversary Lt. Thaddeus Harris. He's replaced by Art Metrano who plays Lt. Hauser, the wanna-be Captain who will stop at nothing to see the force fail so that he can take over. He's good and it's fun to watch him get pranked by Mahoney but he doesn't have the seriousness/comedic timing that G.W. Bailey had as Harris. The late Jerry Paris takes over on the directing helm and seems to keep the Police Academy recipe in full force. As mostly a TV Director but a seasoned actor Paris should know all about comedy. Also to keep things fresh that added some new faces to the cast. Bob 'Bobcat' Goldthwait stars as the leader of the gang that is ruining the neighborhood that the Academy cadets are trying to clean up. Granted the first few moments of Goldthwait played Zed or playing himself are funny. The voice and the nervous little tics are humorous but then they just aren't funny anymore. And he's far from believable as the leader of any gang. Tim Kazurinsky plays Sweetchuck, the innocent, scared little store owner being harassed by Zed and his goons. And Howard Hesseman as Captain Lassard, little brother of Eric Lassard. Hesseman is good as their leader but the story isn't strong enough so everyone kinda falters because of it.Just like the first, Police Academy 2 is STUPID!! But that is exactly what Police Academy is and meant to be. It doesn't try to be anything but. All the characters are funny and have their own little quirks and it's a revisiting that was to be expected and done in an okay style. It's still even not as good as the original, but it is a sequel. The plot and story isn't quite as interesting as the original. Everything else is practically the same, and more of it!! There are still several silly little spots that you'll find yourself laughing out loud about. It's slapstick and still low budget and just fun. Rent this one with the original and you'll have a good laugh.

It did however provide a good fun and was a box office success. It grossed over 100 million dollars , so a sequel wasn't really a surprise. I don't really think that there was any potential to make a good comedy series here , but that's Hollywood. They should stop with this one. The rest movies of the series are just embarrassing. Police academy 2 Their first assignment takes the if it ain't broke, don't fix it approach. It was quickly rushed into production to capitalize on the successful first film. This movie is rated PG-13 and it's kinda sad that they toned down the raunchy humor and crude manners. It's obviously not as fresh or funny as the original , but it has it's moments. Jerry Paris replaces Hugh Wilson as the director and there are new writers Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield. The score is once again by Robert Folk. The old characters are back - Mahoney, Tackleberry, Hightower, Hooks, Fackler, Jones, and Commandant Lassard. We are introduced to an array of new characters such as Lt. Mauser , Proctor , Pete Lassard , Sweetchuck , Zed , Vinnie and Kirkland. The filmmakers sure had the knack for creating memorable funny characters. Bobcat Goldthwait is sometimes funny and sometimes annoying with his nervous voice and ticks. Peter Van Norden shines as the gross-out cop who eats anything and Tim Kazurinsky is just adorable as the unlucky merchant. Other characters both old and new are also entertaining.The best jokes ? The opening of this film having a guy locking up his store , Michael Winslow's Bruce Lee impersonation , forced anal inspection , Sweetchuck constantly terrorized by Zed, the subplot with Tackleberry finding the girl of his dreams. If you liked the first one you should have some fun with this one too. Everything else is practically the same, and more of it.The thing about this movie as compared to the sequels is that this one is funny (at least sometimes). After this one the movies went completely downhill. I give it 4/10.

How they could mess things up this badly says a lot about the other sequels.Basically the plot is that six of the characters we know and love from the first Police Academy movie are now on their first assignment - to stop a gang of hooligans that like to scream every last line of dialogue. While this is happening someone tries to replace Lieutenant Harris as the guy fans of the original love to hate, this time we just hate him as he tries to go for the job of inspector.Now my one big problem with this is that these people go into situations that last the entire movie that are just so... BORING. Do we really care about Tackleberry and his first love(who's just like him)? Are we really supposed to give a crap about any of these new characters who are just there to try and either imitate the first one or just being really boring.Now there are compliments - this movie does amuse me in places - but most of the time it's just smirks here and there. All of these parts I could count with my hands. Also unlike other bad sequels this one is just over 80 minutes long. I won't watch 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 (are there more?) because from what I've heard they get worse and worse, not only that but it seems to me like they just wanted to make a sequel in hopes of just making more money and nothing else. I will only watch the first one again and that's it.

Having said that, I rate this installment of the series as one of the worst of the movies. It doesn't have many moments that make you chuckle like some of the other ones, and to me doesn't seem to have the same energy.The film is good in that it introduces new characters such as Zed, Mr Sweetchuk (can't spell his name) and Proctor, but the absence of Harris and Callihan is felt. Mouser is alright as the guy that everyone hates, but the reason he isn't liked is because he is just a tool, whereas Harris was a tool who thought he was good at his job but kept making really horrible mistakes and blaming it on others.So I give this a 4/10.

Most of the cast is back, most of the jokes are back, and unfortunately the crude sexual and racial humour has returned as well, which gives what is otherwise a harmless load of old rubbish an uncomfortable edge.So this time around the gang of raw recruits - Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Marion Ramsey, David Graf and the rest - tackle their first assignment in what is essentially a series of sketches that start for no reason and go nowhere. Scenes begin when characters bump into each other seemingly at random and end when the jokes fizzle out. In one scene, George Gaynes walks down a dark alley and takes on a street gang. Why is he walking down that alley? Because he just is, that's why. It's an excuse for something to happen, which would be fine if what happened was funny, but this is the 'Police Academy' series and we all know what that means.Most of the jokes are predictable and laboured, with no escalation or extrapolation or mining of any comedic potential. For instance a goldfish bowl is left on a hot plate. I expected the water to start boiling. It does. And then... the scene ends. One character's shampoo is replaced with glue. I expected his hands to get stuck to his head. They do. And then&#x85; that's it. The set-up is invariably the punchline, and the result is a series of spluttering non-sequiturs bolted together in no particular order.There are a few genuine laughs scattered about but they tend to come from the performers rather than the material Bobcat Goldthwait swipes the movie out from under everyone else and plays possibly the only character in the entire series with more than one side to his personality, while Art Metrano, Tim Kazurinsky and Lance Kinsey also elevate the weak business they're given. Their performances belong in a funnier film.As in the original movie, there are racist slurs that do not belong in a movie as silly and inconsequential as this one. Yes, the characters spouting them are shown to be ignorant, and yes, they are the bad guys, and yes, they get their comeuppance - but even so, it's jarring, tonally inconsistent and serves no purpose. And what's with the bizarre blackface gag? Equally discomfiting are the man-eating gay characters in the Blue Oyster bar, portrayed as before in a creepily juvenile way that wasn't funny in 1985, let alone today.Yes, it's a goofy comedy aimed at teenage boys, but I didn't laugh as a teenage boy and I'm not laughing now. "},{"Title":"Never fool with a  fuzz ball.","Date":"29 March 2009","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The first of the more than half a dozen Police Academy sequels took a huge step downwards. It's amazing to think that so many sequels were made when the original wasn't even very good and the sequels were immediately crappy. Then again, with a tagline like Their First Assignment, it's impossible to think that they might have stopped making sequels at part 2. I watched the first two movies a couple days ago and my immediate reaction was to wonder what the original audiences thought of the movies. The comedy is now so dated and goofy that I can't imagine it ever being genuinely funny, except in the way that it's funny to see the things that people wore in the 80s.Times have definitely changed, and one way that they seem to have changed more than anything else, in this movie and countless others, is the way that the outcasts of society dressed. Watch any 80s movie that has gangsters or rappers or punk or any of the above in it, and I challenge you not to laugh out loud at the styles that were 'cool' back then. Some choice selections in the Friday the 13th series are classic for this kind of comedy, as are the Police Academy sequels.But at any rate, it's important to notice that this kind of thing makes re-watching these old movies more fun, not less. You will find yourself laughing at things completely different from what was originally meant to be funny, but it's still a good time nonetheless. However, the problem with the original movie was the bad jokes that went on for too long. There is a place for tasteless jokes in the movies, but not when they keep going and going until you just feel uncomfortable. When Commandant Lassard was up at that podium attempting to give a speech while the prostitute was behind the curtain, I was trying to imagine someone still laughing by the time it finally stopped and I just couldn't picture it, and part 2 has the same problem.All of the relevant cast are back and they are all graduates now working in the real world. Mahoney is riding a three-wheeler on what looks like the northern part of Santa Monica beach while Tackleberry has managed to secure the top position of a school crossing guard, something that I thought was reserved for elderly citizens looking for volunteer work. Commandant Lassard's brother Pete is introduced as the captain of police precinct 16, which has finally been awarded the official title of worst precinct in the city, and our dear old police chief Henry Hurst is fed up with all the riffraff. He is giving Pete Lassard 30 days to turn the precinct around before he throws him out and awards his job to Part 2's funniest cast addition Lieutenant Mouser, who easily surpasses the missing Lieutenant Harris from the first movie in oily creepiness and sheer, unapologetic ass-kissing. Pete Lassard thus sets about on a mission to turn his precinct from an embarrassment to a success using the six new recruits awarded to him by his brother, while Mouser sets about on a mission to ensure their failure. So the new recruits are Mahoney, Tackleberry, Hightower, Brooks (the one with the voice that truly lives up to Mouser's name, which is probably why he picks on her so much), Larvell Jones, the guy with the sounds, and Fackler, the geeky, accident-prone white guy with the nutty wife. While it's true that the plot of Police Academy 2 is as thin and see-through as grandma's underpants, I would be lying if I said it was without its amusing moments. Sadly, most of the ones that were meant to be amusing are not. Larvell Jones' first scene, where he makes bodily noises in a restaurant and ruins the date between some uppity tool and his even more uppity date, is about as un-funny as any failed slapstick skit I've ever seen, but I imagine that at least the epoxy-shampoo gag was once a mildly entertaining joke. But while much of the original comedy has completely disappeared along with Bobcat Goldthwait's bizarre screamy tantrums and Steve Guttenberg's career, there are some other things that remain a bit of fun. Tackleberry's obsession with guns is tied to a total lack of sexual experience in a development of psychological depth that I would never have expected from a Police Academy movie, and while Mahoney's slovenly partner, now better known as the gas man from Dumb & Dumber, plays the greasy sloppiness of his character through the roof, you can't help but admire his effort. But that whole third act with Mahoney undercover can just be tossed to the wolves. WOW. Bobcat Goldthwait's entire performance in this movie is ridiculous in the extreme, but at least he was SUPPOSED to look foolish and nuts. Mahoney's undercover act was just stupid, and this is not a term that I use lightly.I've seen all of the Police Academy movies, but before a couple days ago I hadn't seen any of them in at least ten years, and so don't remember anything about any of the other sequels. I can only hope that they get better or at least don't get worse, although it is not very discouraging that my limited perusal of various online reviews names this as one of the better sequels.

This is only part of the truth. The fact is that after Police Academy 2, the series had two top-billing stars. The other one was Bobcat Goldthwait, he with the amazing power to convince audiences that screaming and nervous tics constitutes a comedy act. Together, these two could have made any B-grade comedy film a masterpiece, but they soon decided they had better things to do.Bobcat's performance here is fairly standard stuff for him. Simply act like a brutish thug who obviously took too much acid during the 1970s, and let nature take its course. Given that he only appears in the film's final act after some fairly hilarious shenanigans from the rest of the cast, the fact that his is the most memorable performance in the entire film should tell you a lot.The rest of the film is all about the original cast, as well as several new faces obviously intended as substitutes for the old that weren't brought back, acting out a situation where they're no longer misfits looking for a new path in life, but still trying to make the grade where their superiors are concerned. Never mind that recruits like Tackleberry would never get within shouting distance of passing the Academy's psych screening, it's what they did after the fact that this film covers.This episode also marks the debut of Michael Winslow's Bruce Lee schtick, which remains a poignant example of how much easier it was to laugh in a world without political correctness. However, instead of a main player, Winslow is relegated to a sideline act for this episode. Which is hardly surprising. In spite of numerous players being excised from the original cast, this sequel looks and feels overcrowded. As a result, each of the Police Academy sequels sees the characters taking turns at development.In Police Academy 2, Tackleberry gets his turn to be developed, and boy what a turn it is. The concept of this nutter finding a woman, who in turn has an entire family, that shares his enthusiasm for firearms, is one that wouldn't go amiss in a horror film. David Graf was probably one of the most underrated performers in the franchise, making it all the more disappointing that he is not with us to be part of Police Academy 8.Interestingly, the people in Police Academy films who are set up as the true villain are always those who actively seek advancement, be it by fair means or foul. The heroes, by contrast, are content to remain where they are, and advance quietly from sequel to sequel. Perhaps this is a subtle social commentary? If so, I'd say it came about purely by accident. The idea that a Police Academy writer could do something so clever on purpose is pretty laughable.In all, Police Academy 2 gets a two out of ten from me. It's not nearly as horrible as those that came after, but it does show that the makers were running out of ideas already.

Probably because of Zed (Bob Goldthwait), that guy he always picking on and Proctor (Lance Kinsey) who actually didn't get much of the show but still was very funny. Altahau many characters from the first part did't come back in this one but they were replaced by new characters which were also funny. Usually sequels are not so good as the originals but this time the sequel is really better. There were some parodies of movies like Dirty Harry and Death Wish. This movie has a pretty low rating on IMDb and I can't understand why because it's one of the best comedies I've seen.

In turn Commandant Lassard gives him 6 of his best cadets to help out. What Captain Lassard doesn't know is that one of his subordinates by the name of Lieutenant Mauser (Art Metrano) is secretly undermining his efforts to correct the problem in the hope of taking over the precinct. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that, even though some of the same gags from the previous movie were recycled, it was still an entertaining sequel for the most part. I especially liked the performance of Bobcat Goldthwait (as the gang leader named Zed) who I thought added another dimension to this film all by himself. Again, while it wasn't a great movie by any means it was still somewhat enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Average. "},{"Title":"More of the same but with extra goofiness","Date":"24 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" When it comes to sequels, the ability to make it more appealing and better in every way compared to the original that it spawned from is a task many do not accomplish. When a product is made so special, powerful people try to capitalize on it. We all know things do not last forever and for movies, a concept's popularity is only as good as its ticket sales. It really doesn't matter how crafty the script, actors, direction or special effects are, if the movie sells tickets then prepare for another round of what was just made. This particular cycle does not happen all the time, but in most cases it does. The Police Academy (1984) franchise is one of those series during the 80s that was an immediate success. Once Warner Brothers saw the potential, they began making more sequels. The first film, although not high end comedy, did provide a number of laughs because of its cast and ridiculous situations. The continuation of that story is okay but the repetitiveness is starting to rear its ugly head.With a new script written by Barry W. Blaustein and David Sheffield who before this had only worked on SNL episodes, they did change some things but a good portion just repeats the same events from the past. Also because it was felt the last film was too crass, TV director Jerry Paris took over the production. The story starts after the first by having six of the original cast members moved to the worst precinct in need of law enforcement thus giving them, their first assignment; ergo the title. The cast members to return to the film are trouble maker Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), silent tough guy Hightower (Bubba Smith), gun-crazy Tackleberry (David Graf), sound effects master Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), clueless Doug Fackler (Bruce Mahler), timid voiced Hooks (Marion Ramsey) and their boneheaded leader Commander Lassard (George Gaynes). Currently in charge of them is Howard Hesseman playing Lassard's younger brother trying to get his act together.Also under command of Lassard's brother is Lt. Mauser (Art Metrano) who states early on that he looks to have the new recruits fail in order for him to take over the precinct. The gang that terrorizes the city is led by Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait), a split personality type that frequently changes between finishing sentences. For the writing, there are a number of parts that don't work. Since G.W. Bailey did not return Lt. Mauser is basically the substitute fodder for Mahoney and his gang. Plus, his motivations feel out of nowhere. There are also new goofy characters at the precinct, which were most likely created because only some of the original cast returned. This however oversaturates the number of funny characters. Adding too many quirky characters is overwhelming and it doesn't leave much time to develop the new or old characters. There's also no explanation to where the old cast members went - like Mahoney's girlfriend. Speaking of which, this time Tackleberry has one.Tackleberry's love interest is Kirkland (Colleen Camp) who loves guns just as much as he does. How cliché. Every original cast member gets a new partner that has their own weird habits. Mahoney has a partner (Peter Van Norden) who eats crap,...almost. What is nice to see is the remainder of the original cast. All of whom keep their characters like they were and play off each other well. Even Hightower gets more dialog and that's appreciated. The comedy and gags are mostly okay. There are moments that are repeated but they are mostly the ones people enjoyed in the first film. There are new bits too and that calls upon the newer characters. The comedic parts that aren't acceptable though are some of the homophobic and sexist jokes. Even though Hooks is timid in personality, she still can provide the right help. She did more in the first, but here she just sits at a desk mostly because she's a woman. Wow, nice one screenwriters.There's also a new character named Sweetchuck (Tim Kazurinsky) who owns a store and constantly unintentionally crosses paths with Zed's gang. Some of those moments are comical to watch too. Cinematography was handled by James Crabe, the same director of photography for Rocky (1976) and The Karate Kid (1984). Here Crabe's camera-work is steady and rightfully captures all the funny scenes. Composer Robert Folk returns to score the music to the series and maintains the same theme thankfully. Throughout the rest of the movie, the scenes have what feel like a stock 80s sound to them but that's also a part of what made the first movie fun. Folk's music continues to have the march of snare drum and flutes to give it that military feel even though the police force is not an army. Things could be worse but then again we are only at the first sequel. There are lots more to come and who knows how that'll go. Only one way to find out though.This is just an average retread of the original. The script is too abundant in new hokey characters and it also doesn't let the originals develop. Plus, there's no reason given as to why some of the originals do not return. There are still some laughs to be had though with the original casts' antics and silly moments. The jokes are thankfully toned down a bit too (some).

Gone is the slightly crude, cutting humour, the level of wit you'd expect from a successful '80s comedy, to be replaced by straightforward slapstick and exaggerated character humour. It's still a fun film, but only in a mildly amusing kind of way, and more than a little childish.There's virtually no plotting here to speak of, other than having most of the characters return to set up base in a run-down precinct where they get up to the usual hijinks. It's notable that many of the original cast members have little to do other than play on expectation, with the exception being Michael Winslow who continues to delight as always. The newcomers are the ones who really steal the show Bobcat Goldthwait is unforgettable (and not necessarily in a good way) as the gang leader, but it's Art Metrano who really shines as the new adversary. I even preferred him to G. W. Bailey in the first film, and that shower gag is the movie's highlight for me. "},{"Title":"Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment","Date":"23 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" The first PA film I saw back when I was but a mere sprog and to this day I still think its probably the best of the bunch. Pretty much all the cast return for this assignment, well the main cast, and the story continues on from their graduation of the Police Academy. I do like that this film series manages to keep continuity time after time, gotta give kudos for that with such a big cast.The plot is again very simple, the new officers are all doing well in their respective roles but are called on to help Cmdt. Eric Lassard's brother. It seems his precinct is the worse in the city (unknown which city) thanks to a ruthless gang of thugs. So its up to the new rookie officers to clean up the neighbourhood, Academy style.So yes the story continues on from where the last left off which is good, the cast are all present and correct which is good and there are some new officers to enjoy in this new precinct. Again this film is still aimed towards an adult audience which assists it in being a much better comedy vehicle in my opinion. The old characters are on form and all doing their thing as expected, Mahoney still being a wet little goodie goodie, Tackleberry with his array of weapons etc...but they are now up against a new superior in the form of the excellent Art Metrano as Lt/Capt. Mauser.Now I really must give much kudos to Metrano here, this guy is even better than Bailey as Harris, in a different way. I really really liked this ass kissing slimebucket so much, the way he ridicules the new rookies, the way he bullies his sidekick Proctor and of course the way he kisses ass. The tomfoolery on show is even more outrageous and rude than the previous film with nudity, especially from Metrano, but this guy just makes it work. The way he screams out 'Proctor!!' and the way he verbally duels with Mahoney can be at times really funny.Lt. Mauser 'Mahoney, what kind of clown do you think I am?' Mahoney 'A juggling clown?'Kudos also to Lance Kinsey as Sgt. Proctor who is another fine example of a dimwitted sidekick. He doesn't do much apart from suck up to Mauser but its just the way he does it. Love the way he switches from a grovelling butt licker with Mauser, to trying to be a strong authority figure around the other officers. This duo are the best thing about this film and the franchise really.Chief Hurst 'Mauser, you're the most incredible ass kisser I have ever seen.' Lt. Mauser 'Thank you very much, sir. I do my best.'There are some other good new characters here too. Howard Hesseman as Capt. Peter 'Pete' Lassard actually puts in a good heart warming performance as the all round good guy Captain, one of the few actors giving the film some proper credibility. This film also has the great honour of introducing the insane Bobcat Goldthwait to the world as the infantile gang leader. Can't deny his performance is unique but I still do wonder about this guys mental makeup, and I still don't know if he actually talks like that in real life?. Small mention for the other odd looking character in Tim Kazurinsky as Sweetchuck who certainly gives a good show as an elderly little man, was he suppose to be elderly? Again the comedy duo of Sweetchuck and Zed is actually pretty good, cool that it continues into the third film too.Of course the humour is totally childish and puerile but I think by now we all know the game here don't we. Most of this film actually consists of the boys in blue doing something, Mauser sticking a spanner in the works and then Mahoney getting revenge with some silly prank. The best of which is easily the glue in the shower sequence which leads to Mauser wearing a wig for the rest of the film. So utterly immature yet quite a nasty thing to do lets be honest, but admittedly hilarious. Never let under age kids see this film because it is most definitely a bad influence, making dogs run out into heavy traffic?? errrr...keep the kids away!I think the start of the film is much better than the finale, the rookies getting to know Mauser and being shown the ropes etc...The ending does become a bit cartoonish with some nasty pratfalls and hokey ass gang member action, but when that musical score begins to swell you can't help but kinda enjoy it. Still not too sure why they have that 90 year old looking officer in the police station just sitting around, why would he be there??8/10 "},{"Title":"Boring","Date":"26 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is a very boring movie.

It's being run by Commandant Lassard's brother, Peter (Howard Hesseman), and once again there's someone trying to make our boys look bad (Lieutenant Mauser, played by Art Metrano) so that they can get further up the career ladder.Really taking the if it ain't broke, don't fix it approach, this sequel works well because the gang haven't outstayed their welcome. Yet. The sequels would keep appearing even as the laughs disappeared but the original cast members had a good run before the rot set in.Steve Guttenberg is still perfect in the role of cheeky scamp Mahoney, David Graf continues to get laughs as gun-happy Tackleberry, Marion Ramsey gets less to do this time and caps things with a punchline repeated from the first movie, Michael Winslow remains dazzlingly talented, Bubba Smith is wonderful and Geogre Gaynes is hilarious though he has less screen time this time round. Hesseman is very good, Art Metrano is great as the latest baddie to be the butt of the jokes and Lance Kinsey is very funny as dim-witted Proctor. Bruce Mahler is still mildly amusing but his schtick is upstaged by the timid performance of Tim Kaurinsky. And then we get a hilarious turn from Bobcat Goldthwait as Zed, the leader of the gang causing so much trouble for the district.Written by Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield, the script sensibly sticks to the strengths of each character and continues to mine the humour from their oddball personalities. The awkwardness for Tackleberry when he's paired up with the lovely and attractive Sgt. Kathleen Kirkland (Colleen Camp) is one of the few character developments but it works so well because it leads on from, and is elevated by, his tough and focused demeanour.Jerry Paris directs the thing competently enough, the score is once again by Robert Folk and keeps the main theme of the series with it's grandiose style and the laughs keep coming thick and fast. It's not quite as fresh as the original, obviously, but the shorter runtime and improved roster of characters (though the lovely Leslie Easterbrook is much missed this time) makes this a very respectable comedy sequel.

Concerning the second part of the series, I really can't agree because this movie is as funny as the first one. The only negative thing might be that some of the characters of the first part have already done but the most important ones are still around and the positive thing is that quite interesting new characters are introduced as well. The weird punk villain Zed is not only memorable because of its great pantomime and horrible voice, the shy and unlucky merchant is really sympathetic and Kirkland is an interesting pendant to my favourite character Tackleberry.The story is not much intriguing or surprising but already more interesting than the first movie that simply hadn't any story at all and convinced only because of its strong lead characters. Mauser and Pronter are some interesting villains as well as the gang around Zed while the was only Harris and two dumb heads in the first part. That's what makes this second part even slightly more interesting than the first one and equalizes the fact that some great characters have gone.Don't believe the harsh critics as the true downward spiral started far later than already in this movie. If you adored the first movie, you should adore this one as well. There are a few very good jokes, fresh and new characters and an acceptable story line. You will get very well entertained and won't see the time go by. After this one, I was really looking forward to watch the third part, too.

I can recall 'Caddyshack' failed to follow up to it's original. The outcome to the sequel was terrible. However Police Academy 2 is a highly enjoyable sequel which succeeds in many departments. The main characters return to the screen again for a fun filled adventure. However Callahan was not in the cast and the introduction of Zed and sweet chuck was hilarious. In fact Zed is the main highlight in the movie and brings a smile to the face whenever he comes on screen. His presence is hysterical. His involvement was an integral part to the movie. His acting and comic timing was on target.Spoiler After completing the training at Lassard's academy the misfit's put their ability and skills to the test on the streets. Lasard's brother is experiencing difficulty managing the worst precinct in the town and demands new recruits. Mahoney and the team are assigned to rid the streets of a gang syndicate that are wrecking havoc. However captain Moser is persistent to make their attempts fail so that he can get senior position. Eventually Mahoney goes undercover to integrate in to the gang so they can redeem themselves. END OF SPOILERThe movie had a shorter running time than the original but this does take away any quality aspects. The comedy portions are more funnier and moser's shower scene is a highlight. The element of senior level corruption is still the main factor in the movie as it was in the original. There is also a plot and the characters had something to do. I could not understand why the character of captain Harris could not be present. But his replacement of moser was not disappointing. He came as a surprise. Takleberry's character had a love interest in the form of Collen Camp which was interesting to watch as a sub plot. In comparison to the first movie this had a more gritty and downtown atmosphere to it. If you're a fan of the franchise, this should be in your collection.

It's up to our lovable bunch of merry oddball law enforcers to stop them.

Moreover, the cast have a field day with the cheerfully inane material Steve Guttenberg brings a considerable amount of raffish charm to his portrayal of easygoing smartalec Carey Mahoney, Art Metrano delivers a deliciously slimy turn as uptight and obsequious Lieutenant Mauser, plus there are nifty contributions from Bubba Smith as gentle giant Hightower, David Graf as gung-ho firearms fanatic Tackleberry, Michael Winslow as the zany human sound effects machine Larvel Jones, Colleen Camp as Tackleberry's hard-nosed partner Kirkland, Marion Ramsey as the meek, mousy-voiced Laverne Hooks, Howard Hesseman as harried police captain Peter Lassard, and George Gaynes as the clueless Commandant Lassard. Comic highlights include the gang ransacking a grocery store, Mahoney replacing Mauser's shampoo with apoxy resin, and Mahoney going undercover to infiltrate the street gang. Robert Folk supplies a spirited score with an infectious marital drum riff.

Harris is replaced by Mauser, and along with him comes Proctor who becomes an instant favourite. Sweetchuck is also on the scene, setting up his consequent relationship with Zed, who here is the gang leader, and one of the best characters in the series. As well as this, Tackleberry falls in love with fellow cop and gun enthusiast Kirkland. We meet Kirkland's odd family, ensuring many new laughs. As always, the old characters get up to their usual tricks-Jones making noises, but now becoming Bruce Lee, Hooks's tiny voice, Mahoney's charm, and Hightower's strength. It is the new characters who make the most impact though, Zed played perfectly by Bobcat will get the most laughs and Proctor's stupidity and grovelling becomes a humorous staple for the series. Aside from this nothing much new happens, there are the same slapstick and sexual innuendo jokes, but that is not to say it is not funny.

Metrano, eager to move up the command chain, constantly tries to undermine the new rookies.  In one running joke, Tim Kazurinsky as a beleagured merchant finds himself the target of Goldthwait's terror no matter what he does.  Some of the jokes are ridiculous and clearly sight gags that require you to watch what's going on but are still funny  Hesseman's fish at the Japanese restaurant.  Goldthwait invading the grocery store.  Bubba Smith helping Steve Guttenberg arrest the rowdy crowd at the Blue Oyster Bar.

Why is that guy the villain? He has plans, so what he'll sacrifice others(who, may be worth noting, are utterly incompetent), isn't that the capitalist ideal, destroying the lives of others for your own benefit(and afterwards not grant them a dime if it'd save their life)? What, is it his ambition? You don't want anyone to get out of the class they were born into? The humor is lousy. At times it reminded me of the show Scrubs(and no, I don't like that either), or a poor sit-com. Even in the 80's, some of the hair here was ridiculous. Maybe this is the same cast. Guttenberg is pretty... meh. Isn't he always? No characters in this are likable, few are even tolerable. The filming and editing are average.

Though this movie would start the disturbing trend of the studio making a sequel for this franchise every year for like seven straight years which is way to much for any type of movies. I say as a general rule a sequel should come out at least two years after the original with three being the optimum. One is to few, four it starts to become to many. Still, the opening of this film having a guy locking up his store had me laughing as a kid and for the most part the jokes were a hit. Granted in the future installments the jokes would become stale, here they were still rather fresh and a few new ones were added in too. I loved it when Tackleberry met his partners family and such. Bob Cat is in this movie too, and as much as I can not stand him I thought he did a good job here. They replaced G.W. Bailey here and I thought the guy who played Mauser or whatever was actually an improvement as they sort of play the same type character. I also liked them getting their partners and I enjoyed seeing them doing more police work on the streets rather than the academy stuff. So while most others would disagree I thought this was the funniest of the Police Academy movies and the last good one period.

The group from the first film all do a nice job here and the added characters of Mauser and Proctor also add some nice laughs. One thing I've never understood is why the producer's decided to turn this into a PG-13 comedy instead of the R like the original movie. The original movie made money with its R-rating so I'm not sure what the point was of turning some of the language and politically incorrect humor down. Either way, as a fan I still enjoy this movie.

The six of them are paired up with regulars, and work for Commandant Lassard's brother in Pete Lassard. Instead of having Harris as the main antagonist, we are now introduced to Lt. Mauser (Art Metrano) and his goofy lackey in Proctor (Lance Kinsey) who want to thwart efforts in reducing crime in order to gain ascendance in the Police force.Missing from this sequel is Leslie Barbara (who never comes back) and Sgt. Debbie Callahan, but we are introduced to an array of new characters such as Sweetchuck (Tim Kazurinsky) - the merchant who is constantly bullied by the criminals, and Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait) who is the leader of the gang that terrorises the city. These two have some of the funniest interactions throughout the movie.Mahoney is teamed up with a grot named Vinnie (Peter Van Nordan) and Tackleberry is the one with the romantic interest as he hooks up with gun enthusiastic motorcycle cop in Kirkland (Colleen Camp), whose father and brother try to outdo each other with sneaky punches (and they both make an appearance in third film as well). Other pairings don't seem to evolve; Fackler's gimmick remains the same, Jones is teamed up with some grumpy cop and then goes solo later on, Hook's meek voice is used to in the call centre and I really don't remember what happens to Hightower, but he somehow throws several criminals into water at one stage.The second Police Academy film is not too bad, and is quite funny in parts. Mahoney still plays pranks, and Zed is a riot as the gang leader who freaks out every now and then, and Proctor's addition makes for good humour. Although, Jone's gimmick with the Kung Fu dubbing impersonation was pretty funny- particularly due to the actual dubbing of a spectator, his overall sound-effects noise creations are mostly annoying. The romance between Tackleberry and Kirkland is okay, but not particularly funny, and overall this film took an interesting direction by going into the inner city districts. The following sequels will have the characters return to the academy aspect- whether in presence or in overall plot.'Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment' is not bad, and slightly dated, however, it is the characters that make this film fun. Not to be taken too seriously by any means, and it has enough laughs to keep it from being abysmal. Not as good as the first or the third! *** out of *****!

They are assigned to a crime ridden part of the city under Captain Howard Hesseman.   Conspicuously missing from this group that were in training are George Martin, and Leslie Barbara.  I admit Police Academy is not exactly the most intellectual or most endearing of films, in other words it's not exactly Casablanca.  But this movie is so funny, I love it.  It's not supposed to be brilliant, but it's got a lot of good moments and you got to love it when the underdogs win even though the ending is somewhat predictable.  The thing about this movie as compared to the sequels is that this one is funny.  The next one is very funny too, but after that the movies go completely downhill. I don't care what the critics say this is very funny and overall very entertaining.  I wish the movie was R again, so this one could be as raunchy as the first one.  Still there is not much to complain about.  The adversary in this movie is Captain Mouser, or  Mou-sah. (yowsah yowsah)  He is a replacement for Lieutenant Harris, who is not here, for some reason or another.  Mouser's assistant is Proctor, a sniveling suck up who is constantly in the shadow of Mouser.The glue scene in this movie was particularly funny (in the shower) and it was nice to see gun nut Tackleberry get married.  And you got to love Larvelle Jones, and Hightower, both are back and in top form.  The appeal of this movie overall is that all of these people are expected to lose, they are the ultimate underdogs, but they triumph over adversity.  That's why this one works so well and is so funny, at least to me. Watch this one, the first one, and the one after this, but don't bother watching the rest of them.

It has lost some of the original and indeed lovable characters (the lovable fat sissy guy for starters). It hardly built on the characters from the original.

A really hilarious scene was when the corrupt officers shampoo is replaced with a most unpleasant substitute and i think this movie also debuted the hilarious Body Cavity Search. Also the gun toting cops and their hilarious courtship and antics were great.Taking nothing away from the jokes this movie actually loses out mainly due to that fact that it didn't live up-to its potential I mean there's got to be at least a 100 kinds of misfits that could have been exploited.

DEATH WISH, one of a handful of half-decent Michael Winner flicks, was cheapened and tarnished by its dreadful sequel. Then there's THE OMEN, which upped the gore and shock quotient for part two and lost all the foreboding gothic menace and new testament paranoia that distinguished the original. Amazingly, POLICE ACADEMY 2 is a rare exception to the rule (as is AIRPLANE II - THE SEQUEL, which was certainly more legitimately exciting and densely plotted than the original, which ran out of steam in the third act), and it would be a very sad man indeed who watches, say, Colleen Camp's obnoxious family beating the crap out of each other, Bobcat Goldthwait doing the mother of all geek routines, or Michael Winslow's Bruce Lee routine (complete with bad dialogue dubbing) without convulsing with guilty laughter. Leonard Maltin once said that there were old episodes of Dragnet with more laughs than this, and I can't help thinking he's missed the point. In essence, the original POLICE ACADEMY was an 'adult' comedy aimed at immature teenagers, and the poorly-choreographed gags involving the rear ends of horses, dogs noisily copulating with the legs of innocent bystanders, elderly gentlemen receiving enthusiastic fellatio from unseen prostitutes (whilst narrating a slide show for a baffled audience) and the sub-PORKY's displays of gratuitous T&A served as a dispiriting pointer toward the sniggering gross-out cinematic junk food peddled shamelessly by the Farrelly brothers and Tom Green twenty years down the line. By contrast, the sequel was a kiddie comedy aimed at teenagers (very much in the mould of Savage Steve Holland's bafflingly meagre output), and the result turned out to be both as dumb as a box of rocks and funnier than a sudden, reverberating fart in the middle of an interminable church sermon. But let's not beat around the bush here, where POLICE ACADEMY 2 really clobbers its predecessor is in the casting. Colleen Camp, one of my favourite micro-celebs (see also Corrine Wahl / Alphen), turns in a performance as lunkhead Tackleberry's love interest that's fresh, funny and sexy, her alarming cameo as the rather heavy psychiatric nurse in RAT RACE still light years into the future, and Bobcat Goldthwait and his gang of squawking troublemakers are both funnier and more endearing than the genuinely threatening bad guys in the original, with the result that there are precisely none of those uncomfortable moments where the film threatens to get serious on us and everything comes screeching to a halt. Sadly, this was the last decent offering from the much-maligned franchise before the third instalment junked any pretence of credibility in favour of wall-to-wall gormlessness, and contrary to what some people will tell you, it's a big improvement on the original, with absolutely nothing to make you squirm if you happen to watch it with your parents.

Harris cause he's a bit more likeable and plus we do get to see Bobcat Goldthwait as the leader of the street gang and what I thought was dumb is when he became a cop in the next Police Academy movie.If you love 80's cheesy comedies, then you'll like Police Academy 1 and 2 but avoid the following sequels unless if you wanna see them all.

Seventeen times in fact.   I used to get really irritated at the cheesiness and the unsophisticated comedy of the Police Academy movies. Of particular annoyance in this film was the bit where the gang smashes up and robs a supermarket, the till assistant calling after them Oh, excuse me, sir, you forgot your stamps. Because, of course, a cashier in that situation wouldn't say that, and so all reality is lost. But who cares? Maybe I've just got older and less likely to worry, but this movie is so bad it's tremendous entertainment. Peter Van Norden is a particular standout as the gross-out cop who eats anything, be it cereal with a cat turd in it, or a chocolate bar covered in ants. The scene where he plays catch with his dog in heavy traffic had me in hysterics.The humour is broader and coarser than in the (relatively) understated and character-based original, but this is funnier. I even cracked up at Michael Winslow's badly dubbed Bruce Lee, fresh and amusing here, not so funny when he did it again in the next four movies. Not only that, but Mauser is sparkier than Captain Harris.   There is a vague social commentary running through the piece as several of the senior officers have subtle racist attitudes. As the six academy graduates are the heroes, or at least the ones we're supposed to identify with, then their revenge is a telling blow against blinkered attitudes. Winslow does his sounds purely for vengeance, while Guttenberg uses a form of superglue on Art Metrano after he makes a bigoted remark. A Chinese chef's comment about you want stir fry? over a goldfish and some minor gay jokes might be questionable, but generally this is, at heart, a fairly liberal picture.Yes, I laughed at a Police Academy movie. Thankfully, the sense of shame and self-revulsion didn't trouble me for any of the other sequels, all of which are about as funny as genital herpes. 6/10.

Even though Police Academy 2 isn't as funny as its predecessor, its much funnier than the other sequels in this series. This went on to be a box office hit as well (although it didn't outgross the original), and Police Academy 3 followed the next year. As a matter of fact, between 1984 and 1989, a Police Academy movie was released each year during the spring. And each movie made less money that the one before it (i.e. part 2 made less than part 1; part 3 made less than part 2, and so on).

What people often times don't notice is how this one tries to parody cop thrillers, although this is an angle that should've been explored more carefully and in the end it becomes nothing but slapstick humor. Of course with our new wave of comedy coming out in the 21st century, this has actually gotten better with age because this comedy is generally good natured and funnier than most of the utterly awful stuff called comedy in the 21st century. (Date Movie and Freddy Got Fingered for one) Still this is all stupid but there are good amount of chuckles here.2.5/5 Matt Bronson "},{"Title":"The best of the series. But is that saying anything?","Date":"23 October 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Ah, yes, the cadets from Police Academy are back to give us migraines once more. As if this film were an attractive production, the scratchy-voiced comedian Bobcat Goldthwait has joined the cast as a bumbling criminal who likes to watch cheery television shows in his little underground gang hangout. Does that sound like something worth paying to see? Me, neither.Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment is -- oh, and this is very original -- about the new cops' first assignment. Zed (Goldthwait) and his gang move into town and terrorize the peaceful little surroundings, and so Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), and Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow) carry out their assignment of ridding their little town of the bad guys once and for all. Meanwhile, Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) sparks a relationship with a fellow officer of the law that gets a bit out of hand.Police Academy was nothing new -- just another typical retreat of the underdogs formula which has been used up by movie studios one (million) too many times. Yes, Rocky was a great film, and Stripes was funny, and the following films started to become unfunny. Police Academy was one of the many unfunny ones. And, as I stated in my review of the original, I simply cannot fathom why the original spawned six very, very unwanted sequels.I also said that the first Police Academy film was the best of the series in my review yesterday. I was wrong about that. Police Academy 2 Their First Assignment is better, mainly because it made my laugh more than the first. But that is not to say it is even a good film -- I am still not recommending it. Just wait until I get around to the sequels past number three...Even the underdog formula can be put to good use once and a long while. All I demand is that the movie have heart -- heart for its characters, their outcomes, and the humor therein. The Disney feature Cool Runnings with John Candy was nothing new at all -- but yet the heart of the film shone through and made it a heartwarming true story. Police Academy doesn't have a heart. Perhaps the entire series is Hollywood's way of getting back at us for wasting hours of our time on other great, classic films, and ignoring their new crapola blockbusters. Perhaps they are trying to desensitize us so that when the really crappy films come along we will praise them for not being of the same caliber of Police Academy. I'm really not sure. Perhaps the entire series is just some kind of punishment from God for neglecting and/or making fun of Him in our films. But even He wouldn't be that cruel, right?Alas, already I am running out of things to say about this movie. What is there to analyze and generally criticize? Everything in this movie is criticizable -- but do I feel like wasting precious hours of my already partially-wasted life on discussing them?

Basically Chief Henry Hurst (George R. Robertson) tells Capt. Pete Lassard (Howard Hesseman) he needs to turn things around as the part of the city he is caring for has the highest crime rate, so he calls his brother, Police Academy Commandant Eric (George Gaynes), and requests some new people. Eric recommends the recent graduates, Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Hightower (Bubba Smith), Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Tackleberry (David Graf), Doug Fackler (Bruce Mahler) and the one woman, Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey). Obviously being inexperienced veteran officers, they are causing more trouble than the gang they are pursuing, led by Zed (Bob Goldthwait), and Lt. Mauser (Art Metrano) is hoping to fail them and become the new Captain. Also starring Colleen Camp as Kirkland, Julie Brown as Chloe, Peter Van Norden as Vinnie Schtulman, Tim Kazurinsky as Merchant, Ed Herlihy as Dooley, Sandy Ward as Sistrunk, Lance Kinsey as Proctor, Christopher Jackson a Mojo and Church Ortiz as Flacko. Guttenberg along with the other returning actors is okay, Winslow does entertain with his variety of self-made sound effects, including a spoof of Bruce Lee, but it's pointless. Poor! "}]
