Luckily Tom Skerrit is on the ground to help out.This is a fun little movie meant simply as family entertainment. Of course it has technical inaccuracies, it's a movie about kids being launched into space. I just don't understand people who rag on it because some aspects aren't technically correct. This isn't a NASA training film, it's just an exciting little film that a family can watch together. It also stars Larry B.

It is a fun filled adventure about a group of teenagers who attend NASA Space Camp to learn how to be astronauts. These teenagers include Kathryn an ambitious girl (played by Lea Thompson who played Marty's mother in the Back to the Future films), Tish a blonde haired and semi-Valley Girl with a photographic memory (played by Kelly Preston who has been married to John Travolta since 1991), Kevin an arrogant teenager who gradually learns about responsibility, Rudy a bright African-American teenager and the intelligent 12 year old Max the youngest of the group. (who is played Joaquin Pheonix in his acting debut, back then he was credited as Leaf Phoenix). The teacher of this group is Andie Bergstrom (played by Kate Capshaw best known for playing Willie Scott in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and has been married to Stephen Spielberg since 1991). These enthusiastic space students have a lot to learn at Space Camp. At one point they have trouble simply getting along with each other. But their biggest challenge is when they are accidentally blasted off into space on board the Space Shuttle Atlantis. If they are to return to Earth they must work together as a team and work like real astronauts. It becomes a matter of life and death as if they don't succeed they'll never return to Earth. Although the film is fictional, Space Camp does include scenarios that real astronauts have to deal with when they are blasted off into space. So Space Camp is a great film to watch if you wish to learn about what you need to learn to become an astronaut. Overall, Space Camp is a very enjoyable movie and I recommend it to anyone.

But one of her missions was postponed so she would be spending the summer at Space Camp in Alabama with her husband Zach. Andie soon met her crew Kathryn Fairly, Rudy Tyler, Kevin Donaldson, Tish and a young boy named Max who had been attending the junior space camp for some time and was ready for the big leagues. Andie reluctantly gave him a chance. She then assigned them shuttle duties. Kathryn wanted Shuttle Commander because she wanted to be the first ever female shuttle commander. Unfortunately Kevin was the shuttle commander and Kathryn was pilot. They were then taken on a tour of the camp. They saw all kinds of neat stuff, including a small robot handyman called Jinx; Rudy dreamed of starting a fast food business in space. He and Kevin witnessed a bunch of big mean kids messing around with Jinx, causing him to short out. Max fixed him and the two became best friends. The next day was a spinning chair simulator which Kathryn did poorly on. It seemed Andie was especially hard on her. Kevin took a liking to Kathryn and offered to take her to the shuttle launch site that night. The two began to get close, but back at camp, Zach and Andie interrogated the campers on where Kevin and Kathryn were and Jinx told them. They were soon brought back to camp where Kevin yells at Max who runs out of the room crying and wishing he was in space. Jinx went to the NASA computers to try and make his new friend's wish come true.       The next day was a space shuttle simulator where Kevin, Rudy, Tish and Kathryn prove to be real bumbling astronauts. Then they were in for a special treat they got to sit in the Shuttle Atlantis during an engine test. Andie, Kevin, Tish, Kathryn and Rudy climbed in, very excited. Zach monitored them at mission control, but Jinx had modified the jets with thermal curtain failure and soon when the NASA technicians started the engine test, to their surprise, the shuttle took off! The crew didn't know they were in space until they gaped out the window. They were just awestruck, but this was also bad news because they were out of radio rage with mission control and their oxygen was only good for 12 hours. Luckily, there was a reentry window but that wouldn't be available for 12 hours! They'd never make it. Suddenly, Andie thought of Datelus, a space station under construction! It had oxygen stored so she suited up and floated out into space and to Datelus. The ship's oxygen was running out! There was worse to come Andie couldn't reach the tanks but Max could. He was just small enough so they stuff him in a too-big space suit and he floats to the rescue, but in the process, he floats off into space with an oxygen tank. Andie luckily caught him and the two return to the shuttle. More chaos ensuses as the tank misfires as Andie tries to hook it up and she begins to float out the cargo bay doors! Back on the ground, they began to close the doors!        Suddenly, it was time for them to enter the reentry window, but Andie was still trapped in space. Kathryn remembered the manual override switch. They could rescue Andie but would miss their window. They had to help their friend so they turned it on and brought a wounded Andie inside. All hope seemed lost. Suddenly Rudy remembered where the Columbia '82 landed White Sand, New Mexico! So with Kathryn at the controls, the shuttle headed for White Sand. They engaged in an uncontrolled tumbling, but with concentration, Kathryn got them through it. They reentered earth's atmosphere and successfully landed!        A pretty good film! Kate Capshaw was good. Lea Thompson was good. She is so cute! So is Kelly Preston. Tom Skerrit plays Zach and he's pretty good. This movie has edge-of-your-seat suspense and tension build-up like all good movies should. Though I think it should've ended differently. It just ends with them landing. It should show what happens to them afterwards. What do they do next? Oh well, that part is left for us to ponder. Anyway, all you space fans out there, SpaceCamp comes recommended by me!

Watched it at least 500 times. Had it memorized from beginning to end. I even went to the real space camp.Now as far as kids movies go, it was decent enough, but totally and completely impossible for sooooo many reasons. I know this is going to exponentially increase my nerd factor, but I have to put it out there.1. At the time this film was made, Space Camp was in Alabama, not Florida. There is now one in Florida also, but it didn't exist in 1986.2. The simulators that Space Camp kids train on are nowhere as detailed or realistic as the ones they used for the movie.3. The multi-axis trainer has no joystick on it. It is not meant to be controlled; it just spins around to familiarize trainees with spatial disorientation.4. Most Space Camp students don't use the water tank (neutral buoyancy simulator) for training. Only very advanced camp programs use it.5. The space shuttle main engines aren't tested on the pad, with fully loaded booster rockets right next to them. They're static tested long before ever reaching the pad (and before they're even on the shuttle itself).6. There is no such thing as a 'thermal curtain'. The boosters are either lit via an igniter, or they're not. There isn't any ambiguity there, nor is there a chance of accidental lighting.7. Kids would NEVER be allowed to board a fully loaded shuttle, much less during a static engine test. NEVER.8. There are no 'short range radios' used prior to launch. The communications for the shuttle go through its main systems, and they are what they are.9. Obviously there was no space station 'Daedalus'. Obviously. And if there were, the oxygen tanks would not be among the first parts to be constructed.10. If there were fully loaded space suits on board, then why not use the oxygen from them to get the extra hour they needed to make the reentry window? One suit has enough for one person to last 8 hours. It would give seven people at least an hour. And there were two suits, so that's almost two extra hours per person right there. Problem solved.11. Going to retrieve oxygen tanks from a half-built space station would be completely impossible for them without navigational support and close coordination from mission control. How did they know where it was? 12. You can't adjust the size of a spacesuit to fit a child using a belt.13. Even if the oxygen tanks were attainable, what guarantee is there that they'll have nozzles compatible with whatever the shuttle uses? Chances are far more likely that they won't be compatible at all. But either way, why bother? Why not just bring a tank into the cabin and run some air out? For a short-term fix, that would be plenty.So yeah, in conclusion, this is an impossible fairy tale. But entertaining, or at least it was when I was 11. ) "},{"Title":"Childhood favorite","Date":"5 April 1999","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I've watched this more times than I can count, and my family has owned it since before I can remember.

When I was little I always hated these intrusions on the proper action, and found 'Wesley Crusher' characters that I was supposed to relate to just intensely irritating. The 'cute' robot in this film is annoying, and is so unrealistic that you wonder whether he was tagged onto the script at the last minute by some executive worried about selling the picture to 'family' (i.e. 'braindead') audiences.Incidentally, don't be fooled by the setting, this is a 1980s 'isn't it hard being young, rich and middle class in a developed nation?' film featuring ambition, whining and cliches.One interesting thing to note is that the fault in the shuttle that causes the launch in SpaceCamp is rather unfortunately a problem in one of the solid fuel boosters, the same location of the fault that caused the Challenger disaster.The film implies in a moment of Strangelove-style propaganda that the booster fault has a one-in-a-million chance of actually happening, but the truth of the matter is that space travel is a very risky business. Were civil airliners to have the same failure rate as spacecraft there'd be several jumbo crashes a day. There was none of that risk brought across in SpaceCamp, where the only criteria for success in space are how much above average you were your exams and how you cope with the emotional turmoil of making a mistake.If you like kids-as-adults films of the Disney Family Movie saccharin variety, then this is for you.

In any case, SPACE CAMP is a near-forgotten kid's adventure film of the 1980s, that had the misfortune to be scheduled for release when the Challenger disaster claimed the lives of seven astronauts in scenes eerily similar to this film's plot. As such, it flopped and has remained virtually forgotten ever since.I'm a huge fan of 1980s cinema in general, so in theory SPACE CAMP should appeal, but as a film there's not really too much to like. A group of bratty American kids and teenagers train to become astronauts, only something goes wrong and their training becomes all too real. The problem is that there are too many characters jostling for attention so that none of them really hold it, and none of them are likable, so it's hard to care about what happens to them. It's interesting to see Kate Capshaw in a very different role to her one in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, and the robot (a cross between R2D2 and Short Circuit) is cute, but otherwise this makes for oddly stodgy and unsatisfying material.

But I have a feeling that this cult consists of people who first saw this movie as a kid. There is definitely some appeal for the young here, seeing how a group of youths get forced into an adult situation and manage to succeed despite great odds. And some scenes do have a little excitement. But for the most part, this adult was bored and annoyed. The youths are obnoxious and one- note, there are plenty of Oh, come on now! moments, there's not enough excitement and genuine awe to behold, and the special effects run hot and cold throughout. Even music composer John Williams seems to have sensed the limited appeal of this movie, because his score is surprisingly generic and forgettable.

They fall out and fight and love as all teenagers do until the day when they are allowed to sit in a shuttle during an engine test.  A lonely robot wants to help Max get into space and launches the kids for real.This is very much a film of two halves.  The first half is the usual teenage issue stuff mixed with some fantasy.  The characters fight, moan, make out, hate authority etc.  This is all quite dull but it livens up in the second half.  When they get launched into space we actually get some real dram &#150; even if it is a bit silly and very unrealistic.  The story is OK and has some nice lines &#150; `I'm waiting for ET's &#150; can you imagine waiting for signs of intelligence?' one teen says `I know the feeling' comes the reply!  However the worst bits revolve about robot Jinx &#150; the jar-jar Binks of his time (he even sounds a bit like him!).  Jinx is just for the kids and his scenes with Max are horribly cute and sugary.The rest of the cast are so-so.  Skerrit and Chapsaw are good as the adults and they don't give the impression that this is below them.  The teens however could easily have doen without names and just be called the stereotype they represent.  A very young Joaquin Phoenix (then called Leaf) is the cute kid Max and made me want to slap him every time he came on screen.  Thompson is the eager beaver who learns to relax.  Tate Donovan is poor as the `too cool for school' rich kid in the group.  Kelly Preston is actually good as the ditzy one who is really smart and Scott covers all bases by being `the black one' but he isn't given anything to do other than that.Overall both halves of the film have good things and bad things &#150; but overall it is quite enjoyable and kids will love it without noticing the poor back projection and the rubbish Jinx.

Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space. This camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things. Give it a rest, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts just yet, just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp. However, you do get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me. Probably for a few others as well, who else would like to see Kate Capshaw's face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature.

This film is none of those. It is cliché, it is formula, but it is also fun. It doesn't ask you to think, it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality.

As another commenter pointed out the John Williams sound score was, as usual, excellent. And the fact that a lot of the film was shot in Huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable. It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening, but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein.

Next to The Explorers, another 80s sci-fi adventure, this is a fun movie about young kids getting to participate in space exploration.Space Camp is about a bunch of smart kids and teenagers recruited into a camp in which they must master training to be young astronauts. Unfortunately, a small group find out that their training is put to the test a little early, as their inside a shuttle that accidentally launches. They make it all the way to space, capable of seeing the moon and everything, but run out of oxygen. So, this being a family movie, each must overcome their fears and for some, their arrogance, and work together as a team and know that eventually, they'll beat their dilemma. Afterall, it was what they were trained to do. This movie has a bunch of familiar 80s actors, young and old. Tate Donovan is Kevin Donaldson, a kid who doesn't really care about the importance of Space Camp, he's more interested in girls and he wishes everyone would stop putting so much responsbility on him. Lea Thompson is Kathryn Fairly, the girl he's got his eye on. Kelly Preston is Tish, Scott Coffey is Gardner, Tom Skerrit is Commander Zach Burkstroom, Kate Capshaw is Andie Burkstroom (the leader of the mission), and Joaquin Phoenix is the shrilly voiced irritating youngster wimp of the group who exemplifies the morals of building self-confidence. It may be too corny for teenagers, but young kids might still find this movie enjoyable and hopefully, not too recognizeably dated.

It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot.

Granted, at that time I was following the space program pretty closely, as a lot of kids were. The space shuttle was still a big deal, and the Challenger accident was still a fresh memory.I'm not sure if U.S. Space Camp thought this was a good advertising vehicle for their program or not. Honestly, spending the summer with this pack of idiots would have turned me off completely. Perhaps the exception would be the character played by Larry B. Scott. Perhaps I just loved Revenge Of The Nerds. Lea Thompson's character was slightly tolerable in her seriousness, but this was a far cry from 1984's Red Dawn or Back To The Future trilogy. A paycheck, I guess.The producers must have thought they were producing Shakespeare and needed to cheer it up a bit. This can be the only reason for the inclusion of Leaf Phoenix's insanely irritating character, Max, and the stupid robot. Enough said. In my recent screening, I kept looking for obvious evidence that his scenes had been edited in. No such luck. What grating nonsense.
