This was no exception. Once again, he delivers the goods and is involved in an interesting story.Gere, a follower, I believe, of the Dalai Lama whom the Communists forced out of Tibet, uses this film to get his shots in at his mentor's enemy. Anyone who thinks this is just a coincidence is pretty naive. Nonetheless, the facts support the film's stark, brutal portrayal of Communist China's leadership. At the very least, it shows a regime unwilling to hear both sides of a story. (Hollywood has often given the same treatment to the U.S. government, showing it more often in a corrupt light, which is ludicrous compared to restrictive Communist China.)Anyway, Gere really dominates this film, being in almost every scene. This is your basic frame-up-then-prove-your-innocence-in-court story. It keeps your attention throughout although I thought the ending was a bit confusing because things happened almost too fast for the viewer to take in. At two hours, the film could have been trimmed a tad but the lulls in here were not much. Overall, an underrated film and unjustly criticized by the national critics, most of whom don't like it when communism is bashed.

Ask any North Korean refugee who's been captured in China -Ask any member of the harmless Falun Gong religious sect -Ask anyone connected by family ties with those identified as having participated in the Tianenmen Square protests (the protests were actually in quite a number of cities - but television covered just the tens of thousands assembled in Beijing). No, it's not an art house kind of movie - don't expect the slow pace and strange story of something like Farewell My Concubine.Instead, it's a wonderful Hitchcock-type story transplanted to Communist China - and voila - a wonderful movie that should have been remembered at Oscar time! It's far better than, say, Hitchcock's Torn Curtain or Topaz - both set in repressive Communist regimes. It's more like a combination of The Wrong Man and North by Northwest - but sexier than either.Our Welsh friend from beautiful Aberystwyth, Philip Davies, has it about right in his review printed beneath mine.This is beautifully shot, with wonderful acting in a riveting Hitchcock type movie.

But of course hindsight's always easy, and since most people who reviewed Red Corner eight years ago never lived in mainland China, it was likewise not highly probable they would see it through the same jaded, seasoned eyes. And in fact, it helps to be experienced in China living when watching Red Corner, for much of its deeper mannerisms only become apparent if you know how and when to look for them.For example, Richard Gere (as subtle and low-key as usual) portrays Jack Moore, a US-based business person willing to forego ideals and politics in order to enter the much vaunted mainland market, hyped up to be the best thing since instant noodles, when in fact like everything in life, it too comes at a price. When time arrives to sign a large media contract, Moore wants to pause and assess particulars by the book. He also notices China's newly-found penchant for blunt nationalism (oops, patriotism, done nicely by a scene where he gauges club-goers' vehement reactions to a coaxing DJ), and doesn't quite feel good about his local contacts (including excellent veteran James Hong). But as a simple mortal, Moore joins a gorgeous catwalking model (Jessey Meng) at his hotel room for a night of brief pleasures. Brief, because the next morning begins with him dragged away by Beijing cops who, having found the girl's dead body in the room and her fresh blood all over him, proceed to assume the American guilty.Now, Red Corner's not a racist film. It doesn't fall into obvious stereotypes, nor does it contain any racial slurs (or profanity at all). Asians aren't made to be villains, just as the uncaring US embassy staff do not in any way represent the Western contingent. Having said that, the movie doesn't shy away from painful issues. It clearly conveys xenophobic attitudes found among mainland people and authorities, as many who've lived there can attest to. Of course, not everyone's like that, and competent actress Bai Ling (The Crow, Anna and the King) does well as Moore's honest, crusading defense attorney, Shen Yuelin, during what quickly devolves into a kangaroo court. Meanwhile, Red Corner shows the abusive treatment our protagonist's subjected to, often to the point of endangering his life. When asked, Shen Yuelin's assistant says that Moore's frequent beatings are simply because he's a foreigner, a familiar sentiment to non-Chinese residents of the mainland. Similarly, the Americans involved in this legal fiasco wish to distance themselves from aiding Moore, as doing so might work against commercial interests based on sheer greed. Thus Red Corner preceded its time by faithfully showing how global factions are willing to play along just to get that great juicy carrot dangling from a stick most don't want to acknowledge. As of 2005, companies like Microsoft and HP openly pursue a policy of appeasement when it comes to China, willingly accepting political strings attached to what are supposed to be mere commercial activities.And if you don't consider all that a sign of the film's credibility, how about the fact that mainland authorities quickly moved to ban it and prevent its cast and crew from entering China? Just for its attempt to challenge an authoritarian mindset and stand for free expression alone should Red Corner be applauded. Additionally, it's a mostly believable project from start to finish, accurately sampling many of China's social staples through concepts such as guanxi (connections) and da ge (basically a nickname for somebody more respected than oneself), yet doesn't make any claims of exotica, while steering clear of clich√©s (save for Yuelin living with her kindly old grandmother). There's one scene showing Yuelin speaking to a police official in English so as to avoid making him lose face, which is utter nonsense of course (probably the actor doesn't speak Chinese). Moore himself speaks just a bit Putonghua (standard Chinese), as do many of the business people and newly-arrived in mainland China. Again, familiar from real life, as was the interaction between him and the locals. Beyond that, for something made almost entirely in California, Red Corner passes for Beijing with very few glitches (vehicles sometimes don't look authentic), featuring ample attention to detail and an atmosphere faithful to the original. Certainly, some footage was covertly shot in Beijing itself, yet due to the government's disapproving attitude, production had to relocate back to the States. All in all, Red Corner also plays it fair, going to show that China does have judicial systems with a potential to work as well as any others. It makes a point of addressing the mainland's criminal code, and court hearing procedures all appear in detail. Plus, eventually the truth does come out, and while it's pretty obvious who dunnit from the get go, this isn't the main point here.The point is a warning against oppression wherever it may be and whatever form it may take, and a cautionary note regarding the perils of blind opportunism. Just because somebody promises you a gilded prize for playing by their rules doesn't mean those rules stop applying once the prize is obtained, if at all. And if we're not careful, there won't be too many reviews of this critical nature in times to come. Relations with China, as with any other nation, should be equivocal and based on standing for your own values, not another's, and that means not compromising liberties and freedoms standing at the very core of enlightened, progressive society. Like Red Corner's tagline says, leniency for those who confess and comply, severity for those who dare resist, that will be our downfall.Rating * * * * "},{"Title":"A strong and enjoyable film, sadly overlooked.","Date":"24 November 1999","Score":"27 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This is a very well written and directed film with good locations and very good acting.

Unfortunately, this is not really true, and the main Chinese lead - Ling Bai, whose name means 'white light' or 'white spirit' - was at Tiananmen in 1989 and emigrated to the US shortly thereafter. I've met students who lived in China at the time who absolutely refuse to discuss the situation back home; that Ling Bai does is testimony to her 'white spirit', and she really does steal the show from Gere here, in a kind of reverse Casablanca 'hill of beans' role. Whether the depiction of conditions in the Chinese judicial system is accurate or not, the movie does succeed in making the viewer understand that there are two views to almost anything, and that in China, as anywhere, power corrupts. Stacking the deck against consular officials is a nice touch, for these people are truly the cowards and turncoats the movie makes them out to be. The plot swerves from the inexplicable to the Orwellian to a love story (which does, it is true, sort of come out of nowhere), but the final scene on the tarmac does much to salvage that. Maybe Gere wanted to make the Chinese look bad, but they certainly don't need his help. Based on an incident that happened not in China but in Italy, Red Corner is viewable without ever coming close to being a great film. Its one claim to greatness is Ling Bai - she's absolutely fabulous.

Being a good friend of the Dalai Lama and Tibet in general, the the Chinese government and army are all bad people argument is what keeps this film going. It could almost be considered a crash course on what is still going on in China today. Don't get me wrong, the film is actually quite well done and has a good story to go with it which makes it more than a two hour CBS special.The whole plot centers around the Gere character being framed for a murder of a Chinese girl. The girl just happens to be the daughter of an important general which makes Gere's chances of survival all the less. Sure, all of the cliches are built into this film, especially the wrongfully imprisoned man (haven't the 90's been a real haven to these kinds of films ever since The Fugitive?). But the plot is still interesting the film throughout and other than a few twists that seemed unnecessary, keeps focus until the end. I never will understand why Gere didn't just stay at the embassy, he must have been somewhat crazy.The bond between the two main characters starts off very cold and warms until the end with an airport scene that was very fitting. After watching the film you'll know what I mean. The chase scene through the city is very exciting although at times farfetched, but still makes for some good action in between a few dramatic scenes. Even without on screen violence ala American History X or Saving Private Ryan, this film still manages to invoke fear simply knowing that the Chinese will do whatever they please, regardless of human life.This film only helps to show China as an unhumanitary state with archaic laws and traditions. When one is forced to plead guilty in order to have leaniency directed towards them, something is really wrong. Hopefully this film will open some eyes to the situation and be a catalyst to future change.7/10 stars.

Some people seem to think that this movie was being too hard on China.  I read some of the quotes that the Chinese actors made who were in this movie, they said the movie was being too lenient, I tend to believe them.  Just because Richard Gere is a Buddhist doesn't make him biased as some have suggested, he is too gifted an actor and too much a gentlemen to let his spiritual beliefs affect a movie, his compassion sure, but not spiritual beliefs.  Too many people think it's hate, but what it is, is his compassion.  Just be glad we live in a democracy and have compassion for those who don't.  I can't imagine what it would be like to find myself in a situation like the character Jack (Gere) in the movie - it would be terrifying. "},{"Title":"Boxer Rebellion in Madison Square Gardens?","Date":"26 April 2004","Score":"10 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Essentially what we are shown here is not the classical American court drama. When our 'Mr. Deeds' goes to town, the town is Beijing, and his case becomes a show-trial in the cockpit of a new Chinese revolution that is taking place between the old-guard Maoists and the modernisers.   Richard Gere's American is an alienated, rootless 'Rick' caught in the cultural cross-fire between two power blocs. It is his enforced engagement with the reality of another world-view and the struggle of an intelligent Chinese woman to redeem the revolutionary excesses of her culture that lead directly to the Casablanca-esque ending, where love is sublimated beyond the personal to an ideal understanding and identification - 'You have a family here' - with the historical plight of a people.   This explains Richard Gere's unusually selfless performance, where he has had the taste and intelligence to let the women, particularly his Chinese defence lawyer, dominate every situation and every scene. Indeed, this feminist tendency in the film is also reflected in the consistently hostile view taken of the militaristic structure of Chinese state power as so much authoritarian posturing. As symbol of a new China the young woman lawyer is most effective The ancient Greeks also saw the spirit of unbiased law as female, and Shakespeare's Portia is another such paradigm. And the actress portraying her illuminates the screen with her passionate intellectual intensity.   There is an effective parallelism to the revolutionary acts which destroyed the young lawyer's father during the time of the Cultural Revolution, leaving her with crippling and unresolved guilt, and the barrel of a gun in the hands of the murdered girl's father which alone can resolve the historical tensions at work in the courtroom, and reverse all the political lies in a new revolutionary act, additionally realising the great potential of a young China, by freeing that stirring Chinese conscience from its historical contradictions.   So this is an intelligent political thriller, although those of a more Costas-Gavrian or Godardian intellectual purity do seem to resent  seeing a crisis of the Left viewed even from a very disengaged American viewpoint, disliking the humanist American strain of populist appeal in a political context, and resenting the smooth professionalism of the presentation as a mere circus. Even stranger are the objectors to Gere's Buddhism, who seemingly take fright at the intrusion of other perspectives into their own blinkered focus! In any case, Buddhism seems clearly not to be an issue to the scriptwriter.   This film in no way presents itself as the last word on its subject - but it is an intelligent and engaging movie, which, far from slandering the Chinese in the manner some vintage Korean-War tub-thumper about the 'Yellow Peril', goes out of its way not to identify the Chinese people with their masters. Curiously, this is exactly what the film's detractors do!   There is a sly reference to the Boxer Rebellion that began China's long road to modernisation, in the person of the trusty who was sent to beat up or even kill the American, but who comes to see that the real foreign devils in this instance are the corrupted Chinese officials who have sold out to the worst foreign traits of cynicism and greed by doing back-door deals with an unscrupulous Western communications company, and who finally confesses his error with true selfless revolutionary earnestness.   The fact that this Boxer Rebellion is played out in the blockbuster film equivalent of Madison Square Gardens, and is mightily entertaining throughout, has led many critics to assume that all they have been presented with is a superficial entertainment unworthy of such a serious subject. Actually, the film is fully engaged with the tragedy and passion of the Chinese people as they try to work out their destiny, and the proof of this is that, to any unbiased observer, the film leaves one with a new respect for the Chinese people, caught up in the complexities of their own history, and struggling for a better life. There is nothing patronising; there is emphatically no United States Cavalry riding to the rescue.    And I should have thought the contempt shown throughout towards official American diplomacy and state policy would have appealed to the most anti-American leftist. But are the critics just taking fashionable left jabs at their own right-wing bogies? - and I do mean Humphrey! Let us leave these obsessives to their futile shadow-boxing, forever engaged with an opponent entirely constructed from the straw which evidently bulks out their own brain-pans.

It's a pretty decent courtroom drama - sort of Law & Order Beijing. It's got a lot of suspense, and it provides a fascinating glimpse of the inner workings of the Chinese justice system. I offer that last point with the proviso, of course, that the star of this movie is Richard Gere, and Gere is known for having a somewhat anti-Chinese (or, more accurately, anti-People's Republic of China) outlook. The view of China presented here is an ominous one - and that's not entirely fabricated. I travelled to China a few years ago. I never got in trouble with the law (thank goodness!) but still when you're walking through Tienanmen Square and a column of Chinese soldiers suddenly comes marching right toward you shouting at you, you know that the basic message (even though you don't speak Chinese) is get out of the way or we'll trample you! So, yes, even in completely unthreatening circumstances, there are vaguely threatening elements to being in China.In this movie, Gere plays Jack Moore, an American businessman trying to close a deal in China, who picks up a girl at a nightclub. She ends up being murdered in his hotel room, he's the prime suspect and it's clear that the system has decided he's guilty before he even goes on trial and the court flat out refuses to hear any evidence that supports him and challenges the obviously pre-arranged verdict. How Moore can triumph over this system is the issue.All that's pretty good. Gere's performance is good. The problem is the one American man takes on the entire People's Republic of China scenario. Yes, Moore had a court appointed defence lawyer (played by a young U.S. based Chinese actress named Ling Bai) who becomes increasingly sympathetic to him and wants to prove his innocence, but essentially Moore does it all himself. Even in the courtroom, he essentially takes over the case, questioning witnesses - even when his lawyer is there. That all was a bit too much, and it strained the movie's credibility too far. Still, it's an entertaining and suspenseful if perhaps implausible couple of hours.

As for the realism, I doubt a kangaroo court is somehow unknown in China. If anything, the objectivity shown by some of the characters is nice for the Chinese people. There is still an out-of-date style to the setting. The China being portrayed doesn't feel correct. The plot moves way too slowly. At 2 hrs, it's way too long.

I stumbled across it on cable, and having an interest in modern day China, watched it on my DVR. The movie works on many levels - as an action movie, as an excellent portrayal of the Chinese court system, and as the story of a relationship between two individuals disparate in race and culture. I count Richard Gere as a fine actor, and knowing his work on behalf of the oppressed Tibetans, I am not surprised that he would be eager to be part of a movie that exposes the injustices of the Chinese justice system. It also shows well the corruption of the Chinese bureaucracy, and the backroom dealings foreign businessmen must engage in to get a foothold in the country. The portrayals of the sufferings of Gere's character while incarcerated are chilling, and to my knowledge accurate The action sequences are well done. The inevitable parting at the end of the 2 central characters ranks right up there with Casablanca and Witness. My only quibble is with some of the proceedings in the climax of the People's Court trail, proceedings which are hard to imagine actually happening. However, they do serve to move the story along.

I am not a Richard Gere fan - as a matter of fact I even rooted for Bruce Willis in the Jackal... but I was definitely impressed with Richard Gere in this one... He is probably far outside his comfort zone in this role, and has done an excellent job. But the real star of the show is Ling Bhai. She has delivered an outstanding performance. I gather that only a few shots were actually shot in China, but you don't get that feeling while watching the film - you feel like the film was actually shot in China... I am not sure of the accuracy of the portrayal of the judicial process in China, but was it was refreshing to see something other than what we are all so used to with Law and Order. Overall, I recommend this movie. While it is not in the same league as Primal Fear, it is definitely worth a watch... and it will keep you engaged for the entire film.

Whether it's or not, doesn't matter; it's a movie, the spectator has to know the difference between a movie and reality. If you really wanna know how it's like in China, search for it on Internet or ask some of your teachers... watching a movie isn't necessarily showing the truth. For instance, there's been made a film called Turistas that shows Brazilian people killing and robbing, and nobody is naive enough to believe that's the real Brazil. The same for Hostel.Red Corner is an entertaining political/juridical film towards an American guy suffering a conspiracy from the Chinese authorities and finds a Chinese attorney who helps him. If you like Law and Sociology you'll probably enjoy it and appreciate the ending. The cast do their best and if you have a strong sense of justice, it will be very tense for you. It's just a shame that nobody has seen this film, I believe it didn't have enough publicity back when released.

He catches the eye of a Chinese girl and they head off to his hotel room the next morning he wakes to find himself covered in her blood and taken away by the authorities to face trial for her murder. He discovers that the Chinese justice system works on very different lines to the US system. With the help of a female Chinese advocate he begins to try to make sense of what has happened to him.This film is mostly a cross between a paranoia thriller and a courtroom drama, with some action sequences which don't fit that comfortably, and some interesting overtones about how to find justice in a system which encourages confession to obtain leniency, and a woman's place in a system which is, in some respects, strongly feudal.There is an irritating moment about halfway through where the plot is moved along by an accidental, fortuitous, and completely improbable discovery by Gere (he catches a bit of a TV broadcast filling in a convenient gap in his knowledge).Gere is good as a man whose self-confidence and arrogance is gradually worn away by the reality of a system which simply won't permit them to exist.Bai Ling is better as his Chinese advocate - realistic, dignified, recognising the need to work within the system as it as, and a woman of intelligence in a culture which does not value her qualities in the way they would be valued in the West.The Beijing setting is unusual, atmospheric and convincing. The film is gripping throughout and a thoroughly enjoyable and exciting movie.

In this case we are dealing with China. Corrupted people are framing up an American TV man in order to prevent a contract being signed that does not go in the right direction for their interests. The point is that the corrupted and plotting official is the son of a highly respected man, a son who was educated in the West and brought back his corruption, or at least a good knowledge and know how about it, from his foreign sojourn. He is using the opaque situation in changing China to cover up his dealings and has a little group of plotters and accomplices to manage his operations. But the film tries to show how the Chinese today are realizing from their own experience and history, even from their own culture that includes Mao Zedong and a couple other revolutionaries, that they have to change in their own minds and then change their country. This cannot come from outside, especially not from the US that is no model, neither social nor economic nor even political, but it has to come from inside, from deep down in the souls, the minds and the spirits of the Chinese. What is most difficult for us to understand is that the Chinese live on a completely different set of principles and concepts and that they have to invent a new open society from their very concepts and philosophy. Democracy for example cannot be the same thing in China and the USA or France, for the very simple reason that it is not the same in the USA, Great Britain, France of Italy, not to speak of Japan and Finland. There is not one model. There are many models that are therefore no models at all. The film very carefully and cautiously tries to show us how the mind of a person can open little by little when confronted to real life if that person is simply honest with himself or herself, with his or her own principles, with his or her conception of justice. This leads that person to considering the very concept of human being, of individual, of subject, of what is necessary for that individual to feel free and happy. The very point we are confronted to with China is that it is one fourth of humanity or so and no one has any interest in a brutal and uncontrolled change in a direction that is not carried and supported by the heritage of the country, its history, its culture. The United States have a strange but understandable reaction in front of the rest of the world because they are all the descendants of immigrants who left a culture and a history behind them to build out of conscious and willful choices a new history and a new culture, a heritage that became something that had to be built out of nothing or very little. They cannot understand that other countries will not be able to do any change that would break up the fabric and material of the country itself. If you did that you would provoke a ferocious reaction that could just wash you away in one wink of an eye. Actually the Americans today are not better or worse than other countries and peoples. If we from outside told them you have to rationalize your political system on the let's say German model, they would jump to the sky, and yet how can we accept that the political system is not the same in all the states, that citizens have to publicly declare themselves democrat or republican to be able to take part in the primaries, which goes against the very principle of democracy which is the secrecy of our political choices and our ballots. And If Europeans told the United States that they have to ban the death penalty within one or two or three years to be granted the privilege of being recognized as a democracy and keep the status of permanent veto-endowed member of the Security Council of the United Nations that could be withdrawn from them because of their not having banned the death penalty, they would react violently and viciously. Yet to join the European Community you have to ban the death penalty.

Probably the most interesting and suspenseful parts of this film were Jack's initial experiences with the Chinese prison system.We learn much of the legal system, however,  through Jack's  Chinese court-appointed attorney, who is smart and beautiful (a combination that has kept her single for some time).  She is involved in  the other extremely suspenseful sequence  when Jack is chased through the crowded streets (a scene very reminiscent of Elizabeth Shue's dash to an embassy in The Saint).  But, to be honest, the movie seemed to slow to a grinding halt after that.  After a while, I saw very little difference between the American and the Chinese court practices, and the thought of his attorney trying to explain that China actually does have an effective (albeit harsh) form of justice is nauseating--in light of the obvious human rights violations that have taken place in the Republic for many years.Like many American movies that try to capture culture, it pretty much plays to stereotypes.

So the trailer for this film was in my mind for a long time before I realized what it was about or even what the title was. To this day, I can pretty much remember the entire trailer, despite the fact that I haven't seen it in at least three to five years. I believe this was the first place I ever saw Gere, and I know it was the first place I saw Bai. I don't know when I first saw this film, or if I did, really, before tonight. I had a feeling of deja-vu through some scenes, but if I have indeed seen this film before, it certainly can't have made much of a lasting impression on me. Whether that is the fault of the film or merely a sign of me having a quite low interest in political matters in my younger days, I leave up to debate. The plot is quite well-written, and mostly realistic and plausible, if a bit aimed at the Chinese legal system and the people in general(I realize that they and their system is a Communist one, but this does seem a tad over the top, exaggerated). The film also contains a bit too much Hollywood for an otherwise quite realistic depiction of another country's court and legal system, one that is in stark contrast to that of the American system. Some forced(granted, the chemistry is most definitely there), not to mention quite unlikely, romance, a chase scene, etc. The pacing is solid. The acting is top-notch. The writing and direction are marred by obvious sinophobia - hate and fear of China - and a lack of objectivity when dealing with this subject. The writer obviously did extensive research into the culture and court system for this film, but unfortunately, these truths are mixed with preconceptions and prejudice of said system(and possibly of the culture as well), making for a skewed perspective of the reality of the Chinese courts and prisons. The cinematography and editing are quite impressive, not too flashy but intense and effective when the occasion calls for them to be. All in all, a pretty good court-room thriller with all the elements, but the anti-Communism just seems a tad too extreme.

However, his attack of the Chinese judiciary system ends up weak.The movie tries to ridicule the Chinese system one American hero (Gere) and a Chinese altruistic lawyer (Bai) in a bland film.True suspense fans will find this movie predictable and boring.  People who are trying to understand the truth of the Chinese system will find this one very biased.  Chinese audiences will find this movie insulting because all but one Chinese character are portrayed as barbaric, cruel, and malicious in this propaganda.This movie should be shoveled to a back storage of a 49 cents rental store.

The far-fetched plot is also marred by ill-chosen melodramatic elementsGere has lost his parents,his wife,his little girl,he's got no more family,but he has struggled hard to gain a place in the sun ,thanks to brilliant studies.And what about Bai Ling's character?During the Revolution,her family got a raw deal too.All in all,this is an entertaining thriller,ideal for a rainy day,but as a political movie,it makes itself a laughing stock.

After all Richard Gere is big box office especially with females ,but watching RED CORNER it becomes obvious why it flopped - It sucks big time.Gere sleepwalks through this predictable tale of a man wrongly accussed of murder and when I say wrongly accussed of murder that`s not a spoiler because we are talking about Richard Gere you know. It would have been bad enough if we had a run of the mill thriller about an innocent man trying to prove his innocence , but what we get is a dumb unthrilling thriller with an even dumber love story attached!!!!! MAJOR SPOILER !!!!!!And it`s this dumb love story that brings the whole film down. Gere escapes to the American embassy and under Chinese law his defence attorny ( Who Gere`s fallen in love with ) must face the penalty for his crime. So does Gere escape back home to America or does he give himself up to the cruel communist despots and prove his innocence in order to save the woman he loves ? What do you think ?I`ve forgotten how the film ends , but I`ve got a feeling that when Hollywood makes a film about an all American hunk battling against Communist injustice the reds end up second best "},{"Title":"Stereotyped, but PC at the same time","Date":"1 July 2001","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This really is a bit of a strange mix of a film.Plenty of stereotypical Hollywood stuff about what China is like, the people, the government, the set up, the legal system.At the same time, this never goes beyond the point of political correctness; not so that the film could be sold in Asia -- but presumably so that there wouldn't be any controversy in the media that might affect the value of the stock holding of the film moguls.Richard Gere is a TV executive who is framed for the killing of a girl he had a one night stand with, and from the second when he was arrested the remainder of the film was absolutely 100% predictable.Gere is good enough, as the character actor he is, and some of the Chinese cast are very good.  This dragged on and got very boring by the close, however.I don't seem to have much luck with this film, I've tried to watch it three timesAttempt 1 At the CinemaThe film broke down, the sound went and the reel was damaged, they had to give me my money back.Attempt 2 On videoI purchased a video that had no film on it!  I lost the receipt, and hence couldn't get any replacement.Attempt 3 On TVThe BBC transmission broke for 20 minutes because of a power failure - and they were obviously too cheap to have a backup at TV towers.Thankfully on the 3rd attempt my tape picked up the rest of the film and I saw it to the finish.

I must say I was surprised to learn that most of it actually was done on a California set. (Maybe that explains why there was no smog. Bejing is seldom free of it.) I also like Richard Gere. But come on guys... The plot is pretty far fetched. I know nothing about Chinese courts. But it's unlikely there is much in the way of Perry Mason law or that a Chinese judge would be intimidated by or even allow American style courtroom histrionics. The mandatory Hollywood humping scene is about ten minutes into the film. But it serves a purpose inasmuch it anchors the subsequent plot. Interesting? Yes. Exciting? It has its moments and you just know that in addition to the mandatory humping scene there would be a mandatory high speed chase. There is... With a bike and with a sprint across the roofs. It's an okay movie. But there are too many holes in the plot, too many stereotyped Chinese characters and too little understanding of Chinese culture in which losing one's temper is an unforgivable loss of face.

Anyone who believe this movie is real or good should visit china personally and see it with their own eyes. Although it is 10 years ago, you can still have a better feeling and know how some lies can be so contagious and outrageous. I don't object movies with a strong political opinion. This movie is just too out of line and relay wrong impression on innocent people all over the world. It is not only unfair to Chinese people but to other people who is not familiar with China.

Hollywood thriller","Date":"4 April 2006","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Jack Moore, a hot shot attorney is trying to secure a Communications/Satellite deal with Communist China. After the agreement is made, he celebrates with his new business friends and ends up taking a local girl up to his hotel room to spend a passionate night. The morning after she's found dead beside him in the bedroom and Moore is arrested for her murder. Trying to secure legal defense is harder in China than in the States and Moore is facing much difficulty in trying to receive a fair trial, besides being brutally treated inside the prison. As a political thriller depicting the harsh reality of the Chinise government; Red Corner fails miserably. Midnight Express this ain't. As a conventional Hollywood thriller that simply takes place in a foreign country it's quite adequate. Fairly well written, with a solid murder mystery that's not easy to guess, decent performances from Richard Gere and Bai Ling, handsomely photographed with beautiful scenery; Red Corner scores on a number of levels. As most people know Gere is a powerful advocate for the Chinese brutal mishandling of Tibet and probably wanted to strike a blow to the Chinese government with this film which is intended to show the inhuman treatment in their handling of legal matters. It's said here that trials sometimes last only hours and soon there after the guilty party is shot in the head and the price of the bullet is to be collected by the family. It's also stated here that China has less criminal activity and less murders than the U.S., so in my books they're doing something right.Anyway, the movie never really got me. It's a pleasant enough time filler, has an O.K. mystery (which I found unraveled a bit too easily), solid performances and a way too sentimental ending. All in all it's solid but nothing special.

Insulting. Even if the judicial system of a country is different than the other, I really think that it is nobody's business to make a movie to condemn that system. These are the works that is asking for trouble.I am born a Buddhist and I am a full fledge worshipper of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, and I do yearly Pilgrimage.
