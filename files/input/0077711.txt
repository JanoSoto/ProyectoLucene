Ingrid Bergman is terrific, despite a deliberately naff hairdo which makes her look like Queen Elizabeth II of the UK rather than the faded beauty she is.  Liv Ullman also has visual nuances to enhance her character - the glasses, platted hair and jumpers enabling this beautiful woman to look frumpy.The acting is simply amazing, even through the subtitles you can tell.  Fortunately Scandinavian vocal nuance is similar enough to English to enable us non-Swedish speakers to appreciate the acting.Of course, it has the Ingmar Bergman darkness to it.  The sister with the horrible degenerative disease, the drowned toddler, the selfishness of the Ingrid Bergman character.  If you get depressed along with the characters in films like this, you might be better off giving this one a miss.But for those with a taste for this type of claustrophobic drama, this is one of the most powerful films you will ever see.

Eva (Ullmann) has not seen her mother, Charlotte (Bergman) in seven years; a successful concert pianist, Charlotte has spent a good portion of her life on the road, but after losing her long-time companion, Leonardo, Eva invites her to come to the parsonage where she and her minister husband, Viktor (Halvar Bjork), live, for an extended visit.  Charlotte accepts, but soon after her arrival, old wounds and feelings begin to surface, and the film becomes an intimate character study of the life-long dysfunctional relationship between Charlotte and Eva, during which director Bergman intricately examines the causes and effects of all that has passed between them during their lives.  It's an in-depth look at the emotional damage human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another, and how fragile the line between love and hate becomes when subjected to incessant neglect by even one of the parties involved.  As the story unfolds and the principals bare their souls-- at last revealing a lifetime's worth of repressed feelings-- it becomes an emotionally devastating experience for the audience, as well, for there is much contained within the dynamics of this situation that most viewers will be able to identify with and relate to within their own lives.   	Ingmar Bergman is a Master of presenting life as it truly is; reality-- and portraying it on the screen-- is his domain, and throughout his career he has veritably created almost a genre of his own in doing so.  With a microscope of his own design, he scrutinizes the basic instincts of the human condition, what makes people tick and how and why they relate to one another as they do.  Much of what he presents is startling, and always emotionally involving, because he penetrates so deeply and succinctly into the heart of the matter, as he demonstrates so superlatively with this film.  His methods and style are unique, his talent unequivocal; many others have attempted to capture the essence of that which Bergman has perfected, but few have succeeded.  Interestingly enough, Liv Ullmann is one who, as a director, has probably come the closest to achieving that classic `sense' of Bergman, with her films `Private Confessions,' and `Faithless,' both of which were written by Bergman.   	In her role as Eva, Ullmann gives one of the best performances of her career, for which she should have at least been nominated for an Oscar; that she was not is nothing less than a gross injustice.  She so skillfully conveys the depth and complexities of her character, and the differing emotional levels to which Eva is subjected, that it creates a lasting impression and makes her someone with whom it is easy for the audience to sympathize.  It makes you realize, upon reflection, what a truly gifted actress Ullmann is.  And, as good as Ullmann's performance here is, it is equaled-- though not, I would say-- surpassed, by Ingrid Bergman's portrayal (in her final theatrical appearance) of Charlotte; and in a renewal of faith that there is some justice in the world after all, she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for it.  In retrospect, it seems somehow inevitable that the two Bergmans came together at last, though it's somewhat lamentable that their career paths did not cross sooner.  There is some consolation, however, in the fact that when they did finally join forces the result was such a powerful, memorable film.   	The supporting cast includes Lena Nyman (Helena), Gunnar Bjornstrand (Paul), Erland Josephson (Josef) and Linn Ullmann (Eva as a child).  An intelligent, thought provoking and emotionally wrenching film, highlighted by outstanding performances and beautifully photographed by Sven Nykvist, `Autumn Sonata' is an example of filmmaking at it's best; it's a lasting tribute, not only to the immense talents of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, but to Ingrid Bergman, one of the most beautiful and gifted actresses ever to grace the silver screen.  I rate this one 10/10.

A couple others might be named, but rarely do you hear a critic espouse the brilliance of Autumn Sonata.The first thing I noticed about this film is that it is, like Cries and Whispers, nothing less than a painting.  The textures, the warm reds and the close-ups of the faces of wounded souls, all combine to make the viewer realize that s/he is witnessing High Art.Then there's the shot of  Liv Ullman's wounded profile as she stares at her mother, Ingrid Bergman, while mother shows Liv how the Chopin piece should be played.  It is an eloquent scene.  Truly heartbreaking and unforgettable. One can feel Liv's pain begin to show itself it is the painful shame of inadequacy and mediocrity made all the more shameful because it is mother inspiring these feelings in her.Later, it's Liv's cruelty toward her mother in that unforgettable late night diatribe.And finally, it's Liv's crippled sister and Ingrid's disgust at the thought that not only did mediocrity crawl out of her womb, but so did deformity and suffering.The film is bleak (obviously) and the resolution is only slightly hopeful. It is however a masterpiece -- a film that reveals that what the world needs now is not Love, as the song proclaims, but Compassion and Grace.  Liv Ullman is the only actress who can say these things without opening her mouth.  Ingmar Bergman is the only filmmaker who can make a seemingly banal story into an eloquent prayer for redemption and reconciliation.(CAUTION Dont take mom to see it on mother's day ... unless...)

It is this that Bergman managed to accomplish with AUTUMN SONATA. The hyperbolic use of the word 'perfect', too often spontaneously tossed out as a result of confused and mawkish sentimentality (just as one Liv Ulmann's interpretation of a Chopin prelude is described as mawkish in the film) has a right to be used in the case of this work.      There are no demons or angels in this movie. There are a collection of remarkably real characters whose actions and their motivations are fully explained by themselves, in dialog that is explicit and direct but not delivered as an artificial way of getting across the creator's judgment on his characters. Ingrid Bergman, in what is doubtlessly the finest performance of her career, portrays a mother who has neglected her children all her life and is confronted by this fact by her grown daughter whose adoration as a child has turned into an apparently irreversible hatred. There is no forgiveness is a line uttered by Liv Ulmann after summarizing the crimes of her mother's neglect and the results of that neglect. And yet, the character's contradictory feelings are clearly seen in the moments when her need for vengeful expression of her pain has faded away. The daughter who has condemned her mother, quite honestly, wants to keep trying to resolve the conflict, to heal the gaping wounds in her heart and in her sister's heart - a sister who, arguably, has been physically crippled by the cold withdrawl of her mother's feelings and her mother's competitive need to be the leading female character in everyone's life.     Ingrid Bergman's character, though seen as a villain in the emotional eyes of her daughter, comes across as complex as Ulmann's. She has an awareness of her crimes of neglect but remains helpless, by choice and by need, to confront them within herself and make amends to resolve them. Her own childhood is the reason. The isolation that she felt, instead of inspiring her to not repeat the mistake with her own children, took the course of isolation, of seeking praise from the outside, of being the central character in the lives of people around her. Her insatiable hunger for love from others, though, remains forever unsatisfied. Her selfishness, even though she is painfully aware of it, is something which she has learned how to hide from herself. Her methods, of physical distance or the perfection of her work as a pianist has, for all her adult life, successfully obfuscated her pain  - until an all-night exposing of the naked truths of hurt and distrust that are thrust upon her by her daughter.    Anyone with a mother or father can find identification with the characters in AUTUMN SONATA, as long as they can tolerate the pain of the truth that lies at the center of their all-too-human needs and the hurtful action that those needs have caused.

This was the first Liv Ullmann's film I've seen and the first Bergman's color film. It is considered to be Ingrid Bergman's film and she is phenomenal as a talented and world renowned pianist who had never been a good mother to her two daughters. It is much easier to make the whole world happy then your own child. One can be a brilliant artist and read the minds of the other great minds easily but the hearts and souls of one's own blood and flesh would be the unsolved mystery. I think the film was very personal for both Bergmans in their only work together. It is amazing how bravely they explore the themes and events that could've (and did) occurred in their own lives. For me, though, the film belongs to Liv Ullmann, the greatest actress I've seen, the best Ingmar Bergman's actress.I was riveted to Liv's face; I'd never seen the face like hers. She played a plain daughter to the brilliant mother and she was supposed to look and feel awkward and gawky comparing to her mother but her face was like a magnet, her eyes - like two deep blue lakes. If ever the saying, the eyes are the soul's mirror, is true, it is about Liv's eyes. There are kindness, tenderness, strength, and something even more attractive than beauty itself in them - the goodness of her soul. Dostoyevsky said once that human face has to mean something - I always think of his words when I see performance of my favorite actress ever -Liv Ullmann.

The result was, and still is, a cinematographic masterpiece that compromises neither with style or emotion to get the message out. Ingrid Bergman is simply astonishing in the role as the world famous singer that after years of neglecting her children returns to find her oldest daughter full of hatred towards her. A hatred she doesn't understand, somewhere inside being a child needing attention herself. The tension between mother and daughter is building up, at first it is jolly but soon we see cracks in the surface of both Ingrid Bergman's glamorous Charlotte and Liv Ullman's quiet and suppressed Eva.Höstsonaten is beautiful, but it takes its toll on the viewer. If you aren't prepared for it, it can be an emotional roller coaster ride that leaves you chocked when its over.

However intense, the issues are too small, excepting `Seventh Seal.'But his is a cinematic mind, and every once in a while, he'll create an image so powerful it burns its way into the depths of your memory, slightly below that threshold of awareness. You then carry it always.This film has one such scene. It involves a Chopin Prelude.Chopin's work is unlike any other composer's it is designed to be played in a way that deviates from the expected with the passion coming not from the notes per se, but the space between them, and between them and us that when filled affects the placement of the notes in time ever so slightly.This particular prelude can range from one that haunts to one that accuses. I've heard all sorts of different passions, depending on who plays and how rich they are as humans. There is nothing in all the world like the many ways this can be filled and the impact it can have when taken seriously.The scene in question is superficially simple the daughter plays the piece rather poorly, followed by the mother much more expertly. But the pianist who actually plays (Laretei) really knows his way around this world, and was expertly directed by Bergman. Watch the scene, and you'll hear the piece played by Eva in a way that expertly expresses the damage, perverted love, and sly literateness of her character. Then we have a speech from her Mom about wrestling with it, about being emotional but not mawkish, feeling not being sentimentality, pain and not reverie, to be calm clear and harsh, to not show the hurt, to be restrained.And then she plays, and does everything she says not to. Everything. Rather than hinting at yogic control of immense suffering, she creates the reverse notion. Rather than phrasing in the small, she does it in the large with hesitations not anticipations. In other words, she acts through the music in precisely the same way her character does in the film. But the music is far richer than can be accomplished with talk.And Liv! She watches her mother go through this, feeling the metapain of her mother the pain of not knowing why her pain isn't genuine, and tapping the metapain for the performance. It's an exploitation of cluelessness. Eva recognizes this and it scrambles her soul without her really knowing why. It is a few minutes of the most concentrated emotion you may ever experience in film. Everything that follows is annotation, including Eva's awareness and Charlotte's noting of Leonardo's remark to her `a sense of reality is a matter of talent.'I've watched a few thousand films, many about music. Almost never does the filmmaker understand the music. This does. She does. He does.Ted's evaluation 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.

So it is entirely apropos that someday Bergman might direct Bergman. Ingrid plays Charlotte, a concert pianist who has, upon the recent death of her longtime lover, Leonardo, returned to her native land to visit her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann), whom she hasn't seen for seven years, and her husband Viktor (Halvar Bjork), who is a minister. Ullmann is frumpish in specs with her hair up and her dress loose and ill-fitting. She is Ingrid's nerdish daughter who has been throughout her life entirely overshadowed by her glamorous mother. Eva has an unpleasant surprise for mom. Her other daughter, Helena (Lena Nyman), who suffers from a crippling disease, perhaps muscular dystrophy, is on hand. Eva didn't tell her mother that Helena was now living with them. She says she didn't tell her because she knew that, if she had, Charlotte would not have come. And so we can guess that there are issues that will come out, issues between mother and daughter that have been festering for decades.I got goose bumps seeing Ingrid Bergman as an elderly woman, and seeing the smooth, graceful style again, the elegant presence, a hint of the old gestures, the sly glances, the tentative smiles... It was really wonderful and at the same time disconcerting to examine her face (Sven Nykvist's intense close ups expose every inch of skin) and sigh and remember and understand the effect of the passing years. Ingrid is elegant but she has been robbed of her beauty so now we are able to see her character; unfortunately Ingmar's script allows little of the real Ingrid Bergman to appear. Hers is not a pleasant part to play. She is an entirely selfish and self-centered woman who has put her career before her family, but is unaware of what she has done. Eva seizes this opportunity to punish her mother by dredging up the neglect of her childhood to throw it in her mother's face (which perhaps explains why Charlotte hasn't been home in seven years). The sheer cold hatred that Eva expresses is enough to make the devil himself cringe. After a bit one begins to feel sorry for Charlotte, despite her failures as a mother, to have a daughter so unforgiving and so hateful.Liv Ullmann is rather startling in this portrayal, with her penetrating eyes, her hard, Neandethalish forehead, the severe specs, and the uncompromising tone of her voice. Charlotte is ashamed and begs for forgiveness and tries to defend herself, but it is no use. Eva is too strong for her. This is one of the more intense scenes in cinema, and one not easily watched. Meanwhile in the upstairs bedroom and then in the hallway and down the staircase, Helena has heard them arguing and is pulling her crippled body over the floor, desperately trying to reach them. She cries out, Mama! Mama! but is not heard.Viewers might want to pick sides between mother and daughter to say which is the more at fault. Indeed, it is hard to say who Bergman himself found more at fault. Perhaps there is no fault, only human weakness and stupidity. Such scenes are usually followed by a greater understanding, forgiveness and a willingness to start anew. However, although Charlotte wants that, it is not clear in Bergman's script that anything good will come of what has happened. Charlotte leaves, the minister returns to looking at his wife, (having overheard the argument, about which he has said nothing) and Eva writes a letter to her mother. It is not clear whether she wants to patch things up or to gain another opportunity to pick her mother to pieces. The viewer is left to decide.Perhaps the best scene in the film is the one that follows dinner the night of Charlotte's arrival in which Eva plays the piano, a Chopin prelude. She has worked hard on it and hopes to please her mother. Alas, her play is not so good. After all, the mother is a genius, the daughter only the daughter of a genius. Charlotte sits down next to Eva and takes the keys to gently demonstrate how the piece should be played. We see and feel at once the inadequacy of the daughter in her mother's eyes. It is a great scene filmed with a tight focus on the faces of the two women. When Eva turns to stare at her mother, who is, of course, playing brilliantly with great finesse and touch, the expression on Eva's face, held for many long seconds, is unforgettable.Not to second guess the master, but I would have liked to have seen the entire movie played in this, a more subtle key than that which followed. However when it comes to dysfunction and disease, Ingmar Bergman is unrestrained.Ingrid Bergman was nominated for an academy award for best actress in this, her last feature film (she had already been diagnosed with cancer), but lost out to Jane Fonda in Coming Home (1978).(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Helena has a crippling disease, and at one time was living in some type of institution.At first, everything is fine, as mother and daughter do their best to make each other as comfortable as possible.  When left alone, they wonder about each other's expectations, but continue on.Charlotte is a very talented, but completely self-absorbed woman.  Eva is a frump.  A sweet frump, but a frump nonetheless.  At first, there are a few catty remarks exchanged, but the turning point is when Eva offers to play the piano for her mother.  She works as hard as she can, but the music sounds contrived and unmusical.  When she asks her mother to play the piece for her, Charlotte does the one thing that signaled to me that the war was on.  She laid down the music rack on the piano.  (When pianists have a piece memorized, they do that to show the audience that they have no need for the printed music.)  Charlotte, of course, plays beautifully (she could play no other way).  However, the damage is done.  Mother is successful, and daughter is a failure.  Although the scene is dramatically pivotal, it did produce one of the few really funny lines in the movie.  After Charlotte finishes playing, she says, Well, I HAVE been playing these Chopin pieces for 37 years.Charlotte's self-absorption is pretty amazing when you realize that her ill daughter was in an institution, then moved to Eva's house, and she had no idea that it happened.  There are some other clues in the early part of the story that indicate she probably wished that her daughter Helena would have died long ago.  Charlotte can be totally charming to her public, her agents, her fans... but has very little to offer her own children.Eva is so desperate for love and affection from her mother that she seemingly misses the fact that her husband loves her very much.  When Charlotte is awakened by a nightmare, she and Eva begin a late-night talk.  And that is when the real nightmare begins.At times this film is painful to watch, and at times is emotionally draining.  Sven Nykvyst's cinematography is stunning.  I thought this especially so in the flashback sequences, and in the scene close to the end of the film when Eva is in the cemetery.Although not as perfect as The Seventh Seal, or Wild Strawberries, Autumn Sonata still has much to say, whether we feel comfortable listening to it or not.

A fantastic movie full of underlying subtleties by Ingmar which is one of his trademarks, to push audiences to look beyond deeper into his script, full of symbolism which reveals a deeper story than what appears on the surface. Ingrid provides one of the best performances of her acting career, one of her last performances on film. Her skills reveal a classic touch proof undoubtedly, she was one of the greatest actresses to ever perform to an international audience. A Hall of Fame directorial and acting performance, with a storyline containing all the emotions known to humans, the movie makes one laugh, cry, angry, sad, happy, etc. and is rich and deep with exposing morales and ethical values of life both on the surface in the script, with underlying almost hidden nature of Ingmars work. The viewer has to think, not just listen to the script, often revealing a world of underlying subtle suggestions to morality, ethics, family values. For a movie with English sub-titles, the audience soon forgets they are reading the sub-titles as the movie draws on in so deep, one feels as if they know and comprehend the native foreign language of the film, not realizing they are reading the dialogue. (Note this movie is now available in English and titled Autumn Sonata). One of the latter movies made by both Bergman's; befitting performances by both writer director and leading actress, a shining star of a movie appearing as a beacon to end very succesful careers upon.

Despite fine acting by all the four principal actors and an appropriately emotive 'autumny' look and feel to the cinematography, the scripting is very dated in a bad way - labored and patronizing to the viewer.It's supposedly believable and relatively straight-forward absent-parent-isolated-child-now-both-adults premise has been very heavy-handedly weighted down by an unnecessarily overwrought script filled with dialogue that borders on the paranoid - an unintended outcome from an over earnestness on the writer-director's part, who doesn't seem to believe subtlety is a virtue in the effective conveyance of a family drama.As it is, the movie has unfortunately caricatured and locked itself into a time-style warp that doesn't lend it the relevance and timelessness of better constructed movies. As it is, the proceedings is much like an overly exaggerated stage-play where the audience is plied with layers of thick emotions of 'hidden' pain and guilt and near-hysteria, just so their minds wouldn't think and the eyes wouldn't stray from the sheer heftiness of things. Audience introspection is minimized and deemed unnecessary. And many of the revelations are closer to the rantings of spoilt children and adults, throwing the proceedings between Eva and her mother into the ilks of rich-spoilt-brats who have the luxury of indulging each other in their own self-loathing.The result is, while you admire the actors performance, the viewer is kept distant from the 'staged' characters these actors are directed to play. It is akin to watching an indulgent family quarreling amongst themselves but feeling neither sympathy nor empathy, but merely curious at the childishly 'dramatic' behavior of these players.The sometimes disjointed flow subtracts rather than add. The most obvious 'subtraction' is near the end where the matriarch (played by a wonderful Ingrid Bergman in her swan song) 'leaves suddenly'. We are told this, but we do not witness this very important departure. Given the overwrought interactions between mother and daughter(s) and the situation that was set up just prior to this 'leaving', there would have been very telling interactions amongst them during the 'leaving'. The matriarch certainly did not disappear quietly into the morning light.In the relatively short 95 mins or so, I felt I have just watched a stage play, where the focus is on highlighting the skills of the stage (and 'staged') actors, rather than on the collective strength of a well-scripted and well-directed play. It rarely felt like a movie. I would hesitate to call it 'pretentious' mainly because of the fine acting. In the hands of less able actors, such a staged script would fall square into pretentiousness.I am not familiar with Ingmar Bergman's movies - perhaps this is his 'style'. Would recommend Autumn Sonata as a 'study' of dated scripting and movie/play making, but not as an engaging movie. Maybe it once was engaging, but not today, nor likely in the future.

The cinematography is minimalist when it comes to motions of the camera, exquisite when it comes to color, and the unforgettable close-up figural compositions .I understand that some might criticize that this film is melodramatic, what makes it compelling is it doesn't use cheap tricks to provoke emotion in the viewer, it uses brilliant dialog and outstanding pacing to draw the viewer in. Once started, it is the character interactions that draw you in more than anything.Bergmann makes us feel for these characters despite their flaws and portrays the utter tragedy of people unable to change or reconcile themselves, much like in real life relationships.He knows how to push our buttons as humans but doesn't do it to give us nightmares but to expand our understanding of the human dilemma. This is one of a handful of films that I've watched out of hundreds of classics that has truly moved me emotionally. Another poster said that this movie isn't gender specific; I agree entirely and argue that this film deals with universal truths between offspring and parent, not just mother and daughter issues or the problem of divorce or abandonment. Sure there are directors that can shock you or give you nightmares or make you cry Gaspar Noe, Lukas Moodysson Lilia 4 Ever as two examples. This is different, but I can't place my finger on exactly what... I can get the sense that Lars von Trier's pursuit of somewhat melodramatic plots in movies like Breaking the Waves might have some roots in Bergman's work "},{"Title":"Ingmar Bergman at his most transparent and direct.","Date":"13 June 2008","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":" Autumn Sonata is more transparent and direct than his other films. It deals with the tension between a neglected daughter and self-centred mother with his poetic style, but also with a personal familiarity that makes the whole film hit a slightly different nerve. I know people who've had to cope with similar circumstances, and their experiences were represented boldly, without the watering down or trivialisation that you'd expect from something from the past 15 years.There is one quite brief scene in this film that makes the whole thing worth watching multiple times. I count it as some of Ingmar Bergman's best writing.Eva plays for her professional pianist mother Charlotte one of Chopin's preludes she had been practicing for some time. Whilst playing her mistakes and stiffness sets a tense tone, as Charlotte is a critical and inconsiderate nightmare of a mother, who at any minute would burst out with a cutting criticism. She instead begins a monologue about Chopin's music, blending together her experiences of playing his piano music, as well as the emotions he evokes. Chopin's emotional strength is not sentimental, she says. It's far more credibly affecting than music designed to be manipulative. This begins the downward spiral of the two characters' immediate relationship. It speaks to each of the characters, their style of playing representative of their emotional makeup. Charlotte's aversion or ignorance towards affection is displayed clearly. It also plays on another level, which I found the most resounding. Bergman's films always deal with heavy emotions, but they are never sentimental. They never dress emotions up to be more affecting for the audience than they are for the characters. This honesty in the way he makes films is explored in Charlotte's speech, I see him speaking to us, saying that he tries hard not to be fake. Not to manipulate us in cheap ways that don't exist in the real world.Bergman is a great director. Autumn Sonata reminded me that at the heart of his talent is his powerful writing. I don't think we'll see a finer writer and director for actresses for a long time to come. "},{"Title":"Scenes from a mother and daughter","Date":"17 June 2006","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":" Autumn Sonata, as it is stated on the commentary on the DVD, plays like a real sonata where it starts slow, builds to a high peak, and then descends in its finale. If the film might not be one of Bergman's most striking or overwhelming feats visually his script provides for its stars some of their best work. In some circles the combination of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann might be comparable to the incredible stature of Pacino and De Niro in Heat; you almost might think who will top who in their given role going into it. While some have put more credit to the late Ingrid for her role as Charlotte the absentee piano master mother, and she does deserve as much credit here as she does for her more well-known work from the 40s, Ullmann as usual connects so strongly and passionately with the material that it could rank as one of her very best in her collaboration with Mr. Bergman. And there is, per usual with the director's work, this need to tell this story of these characters who are damaged and in a disconnected pain with one another that is hidden until it finally has to come pouring out with an everlasting effect on both sides. If Strindberg did Lifetime, this would be it.But what's interesting, as well as comparatively with the bulk of the film slightly underwhelming, are a couple of the early scenes as the mother talks to herself (of course, as in theater, for the audience's benefit) and the subtle touches of the already felt strain in the mother/daughter relationship. There are some words from Ullmann's husband as well, but his function in the film is more as sorrowful observer. Also there is the most devastating character of the ill girl Lena who has become worse over the years. Then, in the middle of the night, the confrontation- and really confessional- from daughter to mother comes out, and it is really the kind of despairingly, bitter but completely honest drama that could only be palatable from this director, from these actors who believe in the characters this much.While there are many a sad, crushing moment in these twenty to thirty minutes of this hidden, terrible lot of anguish from the daughter to the stunned and crushed mother, maybe my favorite scene of the film is also one of the subtler ones and tells a great deal about their relationship. Bergman shows her daughter how to play a Chopin piece after she plays it in a way that isn't totally emotionally correct for her. Both times the piece is played the camera stays totally on the one listening to the other playing, and each actress says so much without saying anything at all- Bergman with disconcerting, judging eyes and minor expressions, and then Ullmann who looks on complacently, still, almost numb to what is going on. And the musical piece itself has a level of significance (considering its maybe one of the only pieces of music heard in an otherwise dialog-centric picture) that adds some weight to the material.If it might not be as exceptional as, for example, Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage, it may be because Bergman is aiming a little smaller and with a more concentrated, shorter view of these people in 90 minutes. But even if it isn't one of his very best films, it is one of his more memorable ones at sticking a totally theatrical tone with the script while also keeping tight, enclosing close-ups on his actors. And probably a few of the points must go to the players themselves, whom have a challenge in the way of their characters not having at all a simple 'hear-to-heart', and without an ending that makes everything clear. Autumn Sonata shows heartbroken characters, and it's not as easy to take as a run-of-the-mill drama or play.

This - even tho good - was maybe the least favorite so far.I had zero knowledge of this movie before seeing it, a perfect way to see a movie, I only knew it was a Bergman movie which of course sets a certain expectation.The acting is quite good. I was quite impressed by Ingrid Bergmans performance (it actually took me a while to figure out it was her). Ullman's performance in my opinion is a bit over the top and she doesn't quite fit the role. She felt like a warm and kind loving wife rather than a woman not capable of loving due to unhappy childhood. I didn't find her believable in the role she was put in. She looked way too content with herself for a woman holding so much anger, sadness and suppressed feelings. Her performance has been praised, but even the key scene when she looks at her mother play the piano felt somehow awkward to me. Maybe I need to watch the movie again.Since I knew nothing about the movie beforehand, I felt at times that the movie took quite drastic turns. I don't know if it was structured as well as it could've been. Things came out unexpectedly - which may have been intentional also.I also wasn't too sure that the sick sister was a necessary character here. The scenes with her are quite sparse and she's left undeveloped as a character and her part in the whole was left a bit of a mystery. I also wasn't sure why it was implied that her sickness was caused by her mothers actions, that felt quite far fetched since her condition was clearly not (only) psychological, but rather neurological.The whole movie was a bit like watching a train wreck, it's not exactly fun watching tormented characters. Which leaves me to think what the purpose of this movie was. It's nevertheless a strong drama, but it left me mostly just feeling sad. I don't know if it would be wise to see this movie again and look for symbolic stuff that I've found in Bergmans other movies, they've felt deeper and more meaningful than this. I was left wondering if the fact that Ullmann's characters son died by drowning carried a more deeper meaning, because it was revealed at a certain point in the movie. Maybe I was just overwhelmed by the drama and couldn't see deeper, but I didn't find a true meaning in this movie, other than purification of some sort.

Autumn Sonata is so real that it almost fails as a film for a more transcending merit that goes as far as your soul can reach. I don't know how to express it, the movie left me speechless, torn between the guilt from witnessing such heart-breaking displays of hatred on an almost voyeuristic level, or a strange feeling of fascination. Ingmar Bergman's Autumn Sonata is the cinematic demonstration that family is indeed the reservoir of all our repressed feelings, emotions, the source or the obstacle to our own life-guiding energies. The flute sound that introduces the film has a rustic serenity resonating like the appeasing lullaby for our worried minds. The quietness of a little house far from the town, Eva, not beautiful, hardly pretty, is embodying the austerity of her environment in a chameleonic way. Liv Ullman, Ingmar Bergman's muse, is again totally mesmerizing in a role that proves her immense versatility, but wait till you see Ingrid Bergman, in one of the greatest female performances ever, rightfully Oscar-nominated. When she makes her entrance, the whole place is inhabited by a shining aura. As Charlotte, Ingrid Bergman's charisma cancels out the apparent dullness of Eva and her insignificant husband. Charlotte is the authoritarian guiding force of the story, and our eyes follow her, secretly wishing that she would be the one to awaken Eva. But don't expect THAT awakening.The movie is an eye-opening experience, proving how the relationships with parents are children's cement to build their personality. Parents either enlighten your soul, or make you live in their shadows. I remember a line from The Godfather Part II where Fredo wished he could be like his father, a man with power, with a loving family, Michael had these words It's not easy being a son Oh God, how right he was. When the mere idea to be better than your father is intolerable, the least you can do, is to please him. We all put some people on a personal pedestal, and Autumn Sonata talked to my soul through the story of a daughter whose ego was dwarfed by her mother's undeniable aura.The contrast between Charlotte and Eva, in beauty, colors and personality echoed my own contrast with the person I respect the most in that world, and I guess this is the reason why I'm so disturbed, because I can't even dare to imagine the pain he indirectly caused me, not because of him but because of the way I perceived him. But how can I blame him for my own perceptions? Or aren't the perceptions in fine inspired by a certain behavior? My empathy for Eva was so omnipresent that it perverted any possibility to rationally judge the film, with that reserve I admire so much from Northern cultures, and that has been so wrongly associated with coldness. But relating to Eva isn't saying much, because ironically, Charlotte was the character I respected the most. call it the 'Eva' of 'Fredo' syndrome.Ingmar Bergman's most unique talent is to convey universal feelings through simple shots, looks, or a specific use of music. Here, music plays a significant role as it highlights the talent of Charlotte, a virtuoso concert pianist, to play with emotions, to fake or overact them, and it lures us into the conviction that she used that talent even with her daughter and late husband. Eva's talent is more debatable, her mother reproaches that she plays it too sentimental, without passion, which are two separate things. Indeed, Eva seems passionless, and Charlotte, with her bright red dress is the quintessential lively old woman. But we know this is prefabricated, we know Charlotte's personality is only a cover while Eva simply fears to contradict her mother. There's one scene where Charlotte sobs while remembering her lover's death then she pulls herself together as if there was a natural weakness in grief. Ironically, Eva mourned during her whole life an inexistent childhood caused by a mother she loved despite everything.And progressively, the film reveals the complexity of Eva's torment and by drinking some red wine, like draining a sort of Charlotte-like force in her heart; she gains enough confidence for the ultimate confrontation with Charlotte. The slow pacing of the first act was simply the patient build-up until an exhausting but so emotionally rewarding climax, paralleled with Eva's long waiting before she could find the strength to open her heart. And then, Eva like drunk by the exquisite delight of having the last word, bluntly tells the truth right in the face of Charlotte, taking so many years off it. The devastated face of Charlotte immediately contrasted with Eva's confident eyes, Eva, almost embellished by her new confidence.Incapable to react to such hatred, she's hopelessly taking every emotional hits, realizing how responsible she is for her daughter's sadness, but maybe even sadder that she didn't realize it before. Yet, the ambiguity of the film relies on this strange impression that each character plays against the words, as said Liv Ullman in an interview, one of the first disagreement in Bergman's careers was when Ingrid refused to say 'hold me' after getting so many insults, when her instinctive reaction would've been to slap her daughter in the face, and being a woman, she probably knew better than Ingmar in that department.And indeed, she says 'hold me', but her eyes keep a dignity, while the real slap in the face is that masterpiece of austere realism, but even more poignant and heart-breaking as I dare anyone not to relate to it. Each family is built on dreams of stability and happiness but we all have our shameful secrets, our lies, our Oedipian feelings that can poison our entire existence. Watching Autumn Sonata is like an antidote against that poison.

It is also the most emotionally intense of the series of Strindbergian or Chekhovian chamber dramas he has filmed over the years, which includes his Spider Trilogy (Through A Glass Darkly, Winter Light, The Silence) and such other films as Cries And Whispers. That said, it is perhaps the simplest film that Bergman ever directed, even simpler in plot than The Silence. It was filmed in Norway whilst Bergman was in his self-imposed exile from Sweden over trumped up tax evasion charges, and backed with British and American money. Ingrid Bergman, meanwhile, had just been diagnosed with the cancer that would kill her a few years later, and this was he last acting role for film, although she did a final television movie portraying Golda Meier. The whole film basically revolves around the tensions between a famous pianist, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman), and her visit to her emotionally fragile and bitter eldest daughter Eva (Liv Ullman), a four-eyed frump, who lives with her pastor husband in a vicarage. Bergman always seems his best when two female leads are front and center. He may be the best director of actresses in cinema history, and certainly the best writer for them&#133;.The camera-work by Sven Nykvist is not as blatantly showy in this film, although quite painterly in the gorgeous colorful interior of the vicarage is stunning in its reflection of the autumnal feel of the film and the state the characters are in, especially the gallery of close-ups that sear these characters and their emotions into a viewer's mind&#133;.Charlotte reminds me much of the Maureen Stapleton character, Pearl, from Woody Allen's Interiors, right down to her garish red dress, which clearly shows that she is vibrant and faces life, and to the motto she claims came from her lover, Leonardo 'A sense of reality is a matter of talent. Most people lack that talent and maybe it's just as well.'&#133;.Ingmar Bergman is certainly a great director, but that greatness stems from his being a great writer, first and foremost. His writing is for adults, and not the deliterate preteens that current publishers (think Dave Eggers, James Frey, Elizabeth Wurtzel) and Hollywood studios aim their wares at. Be thankful for that, and for this film. Autumn Sonata is a masterpiece. Period.

AUTUMN SONATA is one of the most piercingly emotional films ever made, with raw and unflinching honesty. The story of a worldly pianist (Ingrid Bergman in her final film role) who returns home to her two daughters upon the death of her partner, the owlish writer Eva and the handicapped Lena. Though overjoyed by the reunion at first, it's apparent that Eva still carries the scars of Charlotte's choosing her career over her family, and the night will re- open many wounds and create new injuries with each painful revelation. Before long the great divide between love and hate, repulsion and longing, will become deeply blurred. AUTUMN SONATA is to mothers and daughters as WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is to husbands and wives.This is what only two years later ORDINARY PEOPLE should've been and to its own credit Robert Redford got close, but Ingmar Bergman was a master at crafting characters with complexities and contradictions. Even though most of the film's time frame is the period of one night with flashbacks, these two characters go on such a journey of self-discovery. The film is framed like a sonata; the slow beginning, the climax 2/3 of the way through, and then a finale of re-examination. When the film begins, Eva is shaped as a mousy and reserved wife and Charlotte is a mildly self-absorbed pianist. As the film progresses on, the daughter experiences a surge of enough confidence brought on by wine to tell off her mother, and the battle for love, truth and power begins. Finally, as both mother and daughter are stripped down of their armor, we only see two humans desperately wanting love but impotent to do act upon it.Ingmar Bergman's handle over his actors wasn't out of the norm, but it's still exhilarating to experience the performances he gets out of them. As the moral center of the film, Halvar Björk delivers quietly sensitive work as Eva's faithful husband. Lena Nyman is powerful as the handicapped daughter. Liv Ullmann delivers one of her greatest performances as the conflicted daughter Eva, her face registering so many emotions with the faintest of movements. Above all, Ingrid Bergman is amazing in perhaps the most layered character and performance of her career. Everyone loves Ingrid Bergman for her work in CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS among the many classics she acted in. After decades of work, there's a newfound maturity and haunted worldliness that's so poignant and truthful it hurts. Ingrid Bergman was dying of breast cancer when she made this film, and her bravery for taking on at many times an unlikable character is what cements her as one of the all-time greatest actresses. Every pain, every triumph is piercingly registered on that gorgeously natural face of hers, which always remained so open and uncompromising that it was more than an actor's mask; it was a map of the human heart.There's a scene towards the end where Charlotte attempts to atone for her daughter's pain, which is intercut with Lena crying for help. Three people, all so open and vulnerable, waiting for retribution or reparation. This is the end of the climax, and as the film begins its finale, Ingmar Bergman never once judges his characters, no matter how confused or insane they are. He recognizes that humans are flawed creatures always searching for love at whatever cost, and simultaneously rejecting it out of fear. AUTUMN SONATA is Bergman's most emotionally satisfying film, and his last great masterwork. It's a sonata hanging in air, with a perfect and delicate balance of loss and hope.

The story is absolutely amazing.Ingrid visits her daughter Liv. They talk. Liv's cripple sister, Lena, appears. Ingrid talks to Lena. Ingrid talks to herself. Liv talks to her husband. They talk to Ingrid. Liv plays the piano. Ingrid plays the piano. Liv and Ingrid talk. And they talk. Flashbacks. After a while they talk more. Flashbacks. And guess what? They talk again. And again. Flashbacks. Lena screams. Liv narrates, thinking about suicide. Ingrid on a train, happy to finally leave the movie. Liv narrates more. Guess how the movie ends? Liv talks. To the camera, this time. She has bored Ingrid so much that the cameraman was the only person left to talk to at the end.If your idea of fun is to watch a mother and a daughter confront their inner demons and their troubled past (as some critics would probably put it), then you'll enjoy this piece of crap. A soap opera, nothing more, but with better dialog. Except that this time around the acting is worse than usual. Liv is unconvincing; screaming and tamper-tantrums do not necessarily good acting make. Ingrid is a little better, but she completely destroys the illusion she creates of being a good actress when we hear her speaking English in 3-4 scenes. It is when we hear English spoken here that we get a glimpse into how much worse Bergman films would sound if they were in a language we could understand. As it is, Bergman, quite wisely, hides behind Swedish (he could have easily made more English-speaking movies). When we hear Ingrid in Swedish we don't notice how silly some of the dialog really is. I mean, it's still silly, but not as silly as when you can actually understand it directly.This oppressive, overwrought drama has all the Bergman traits flashbacks, marathon dialogs, marathon monologues, reddish/brown colours that dominate, unresolved issues between family members, shouting, misery, wretchedness &#x96; and even a crippled person this time. I've always considered it a very cheap dramatic shtick to put a crippled person into the story, sort of under the motto if I can't get 'em to cry with the other stuff, surely a cripple will get the tears rolling. Check out the truly pathetic scene when Lena is crawling on the floor, shouting Mama!. I mean, it's so damn manipulative that it can only work with uncritical or inexperienced viewers.Plot-wise, Bergman really lays on the misery. Not only is Liv scarred for life by her mother's cold behaviour, but she also has a cripple sister. And her health has been worsening steadily for years. And Liv thinks about suicide. And she and her husband couldn't have children for a long time. And if you think that was enough for Bergman, you're wrong you see, Liv eventually gave birth to a son, but alas, he's dead. And he was just a child, of course, when he died. Of course. So basically, the only disaster Bergman didn't include was the sky falling on everyone's collective heads.I found it rather pretentious (you can't have a(n honest) Bergman review without this word) how Bergman keeps throwing in all those names of classical composers, and their works. It's sort of his way of saying, see? I listen to classical music, and these are my favourite pieces of it. As if anyone cares what he listens to. You're an educated, cultured ex-Nazi, we get it.There is an endless scene with Liv and Ingrid that lasts about 20 minutes (if I'm not mistaken). If you survive that, you can watch any of his other movies. (Except The Silence; that will test even the most boredom-immune viewer.) The melodious, soft-as-a-bird's-beak Swedish language lends audio beauty to this visual feast. The sound coming out of these actors' mouths are like music to my ears...If you are unhappy with Autumn Sonata, which you must be, just google Vjetropev Bergman Spoofs and this will lead you to my video clips with the vastly improved movie.

"},{"Title":"A major work of art","Date":"4 April 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":" Ingmar Bergman shot Autumn Sonata in ravishing color, (Sven Nykvist again was his DoP), and set it in the present but it may as well have been in black and white and set a hundred or so years ago since this is one of his most rigorous films, seen almost entirely in close-up. It's about the relationships between a mother and her daughter, (two daughters if you count the girl in near vegetative state upstairs), and the great and painful chasm that exists between them. The mother is a great concert pianist, poised, self-assured and frostier than any ice maiden and she is played by Ingrid Bergman, working with the director for the first time and giving a magnificent performance. The daughter is the mousy, timorous wife of a vicar until one extraordinary night she roars and pours out all the bile she has inside her and she is played superbly by Liv Ullmann.To say that the characters in Bergman's films don't speak or act the way 'real' people do is like saying Shakespeare's characters don't behave like people do in 'real' situations. It doesn't matter a damn; as with Shakespeare, Bergman's characters bear their souls to us and this greatest of actor's directors draws performances from his players that go beyond mere acting allowing us to get under their skins and inside their heads.There are a number of characters in this piece but most of them are glimpsed only in the background. Fundamentally this is a sonata for two people and both Bergman and Ullmann have seldom been better. It was Bergman who won all the awards and got the Oscar nomination but Ullmann, too, was equally deserving of recognition. If it isn't quite the masterpiece it might have been, (there are times it does feel a bit schematic and even predictable), it is nevertheless a major work of art and an essential work in both Bergman canons.

Charlotte Andergast (Bergman) is a renowned pianist who recently lost her companion Leonardo (Løkkeberg), so she accepts the invitation to stay with her eldest daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) and her husband Viktor (Björk) for some time, whom she hasn't seen for seven years.This highly nerve-wracking chamber drama begins with Viktor's breaking-the-fourth-wall monologue about him and Eva's temporal life, he is a minister and how they are united under the guidance of the parish work. Then Eva brings him the letter she writes to invite Charlotte, at first impression, Eva is a tender, self-effacing and soft-spoken woman. Only when Charlotte arrives, who is presumably a self-centered artist with elegance, a vivacious but neglectful mother, garrulous about the last days of Leonardo, puts on a strong patina of being high spirited and after the initial and necessary pleasantry, Eva throws the first bomb, she tells her Helena (Nyman), Charlotte's bed-ridden, mentally disabled younger daughter, is also here, whom Charlotte puts in a health institution for years, but now she has been under the attendance of Eva for two years. The mother-daughters reunion proceeds into a rather awkward situation, as Charlotte is more than unwillingly to face her ill daughter, which clearly evokes her guilty conscience for being absent most of the time. After dinner, a turbulent undercurrent is grafted on Charlotte's professional advice on Eva's piano skill, from Eva's angle, she never quite inherit any merits from her mother, neither the look or the talent. This is one of the main reason of their clash, under her vulnerable mien, she is in hopeless anguish. After an interlude about the premature death of Viktor and Eva's four-year- old son and a tête-a-tête between Viktor and Charlotte (during which Viktor refers that Eva is incapable of love), in the still of the night, Charlotte is awaken from a nightmare, Eva hears the noise and they embark on a thorough heart-to-heart two-hander, Eva divulges all her unhappy childhood memories and attributes it to Charlotte's career-first option; while Charlotte tries to justify the story from her side, but in no avail, both actresses' performances are sparklingly galvanizing, Ullmann is fearlessly aggressive, arbitrarily unforgiving, while Bergman refutes with a tour-de-force achievement, unyieldingly emits compassionate remorse and unexpected perplexity. Both actresses competently consummate their characters' emotional arcs, which is undeniably enthralling to watch, even for those who don't feel comfortable in Bergman's school. Personally I will give the edge to Bergman, considering her the harsh similarities between the role and her legendary personal life, and it is a stupendous curtain call for her illustrious career, although I impulsively think this performance is her career-best. The bond between a mother and a daughter often comes off as an amalgam of love and hatred, AUTUMN SONATA is at its best to dissect the relationship in dialectics, there is no right or wrong in the story, firstly, viewers is prone to cold-shoulder Charlotte's self-seeking pretentiousness, her failure in motherhood, but, when Eva's anger is fully emancipated, her one-sided blame- shooting accusation is also defectively biased, Ingmar Bergman is a true maestro in concocting this kind of brutal revelation of human being's deep-rooted character deficiency, it is not a parable, it is just a real life situation may occur to many others, unfortunately this time one might also sense a tint of misogyny. In the end, there is no sign of reconciliation despite Eva writes an apologetic letter, which Charlotte may or may not receive, the whole mess cannot save them from their respective mental condition, leastwise, they know each other better afterward, the scar may never be healed and truth hurts, yet everyone of us is living with both pain and happiness, simultaneously, as long as we come to terms with that, we will be fine.

It was Helena that Charlotte had committed when she was in her teens to a mental institution for life because of her mental disability. Things soon get a bit sticky when Eve who feels that her life had been destroyed by her mother's absence, playing in concerts all over Europe, now lets Charlotte have it in how unloving she was towards her and the mentally ill kid sister of hers Helena.With Viktor drinking his brandy and smoking his pipe and Helena falling out of her bed and almost cracking her skull open mother & daughter, Charlotte & Eve, have it out in a night long discussion in how their lives were messed up by each other not showing the both love and respect for themselves all those years together. It's Eve who ends up getting the upper hand in the conversation in getting Charlotte to admit that she was more interested in her career as a concert pianist then in her two daughters as well as live in lover Leonardo, Georg Lokkeberg, who after putting up with her for almost 20 finally and blissfully, in not having to put up with her anymore, passed away from cancer six months ago.After an all night verbal slug-fest both Eve & Charlotte decided to bury the hatchet, in the sand not in each other heads, and let bygones by bygones and start all over again as if nothing happened in the past. Later after Charlotte left Eve gave her husband Viktor who was neutral in the entire matter a letter of forgiveness to her mother for everything bad she said about her. It's now up to Charlotte to do the same in asking for forgiveness from Eve as well as the mentally damaged Helena for all the bad things she did to them while they were still together. And undoubtedly in what we saw in the movie up until then, with Charlotte in tears in knowing what she did, she definitely will.

Initially, the mother-daughter relationship does seem a bit frigid though courteous. Gradually, as the film unfolds, several dimensions to this relation gets revealed -Charlotte's career, Eva's childhood, the presence of a second daughter among others.Autumn Sonata's most enduring memory is its crescendo involving the two brilliant actors Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann. While it would amount to being a spoiler attempting to describe what happens, it can suffice to say that Ingmar Bergman's greatness bursts through in this climax and one discovers the tremendous potential of a chamber drama.This is no doubt what great cinema is about and while one of the two central figures certainly blows the viewer away with her intensity, the tremendous impact and presence of the other can only be felt on multiple viewing, and this chemistry is what contributes to Autumn Sonata being perhaps one of the best films ever made, most certainly by Ingmar Bergman and maybe even in the history of cinema.

This isn't Bergman's most famous or most experimental movie (the most popular are Persona, Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal), but it's still very good. It has the classic Bergman set-up a few people are put in a small environment and are forced to confront each other. I found quite charming the fact that the colors in the movie are all autumnal, which fits the title perfectly.After the death of her long time friend and partner, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman) accepts the invitation of her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) and her husband Viktor (Halvar Björk) to come and stay with them a while. On her arrival, she's unpleasantly surprised to find her other daughter Helena (Lena Nyman) there as well, since she had sent her to a hospital because she's mentally disabled. Charlotte hasn't seen Eva in years because she's always touring, as she's a world famous pianist, and after the joy of seeing each other wears off, one night the two women start recalling Eva's childhood and, in a heated fight, manage to finally tell each other what they always wanted to say.Autumn Sonata deals with the negative consequences on a child's later life, caused by the fact that a parent is too concentrated on his/her career and therefore is ignoring his/her child. Interestingly, this was a well known issue for Ingrid Bergman, who had become famous for leaving her family and running away with Italian director Roberto Rossellini. But it was also not an unknown theme for Ingmar Bergman who, according to one of his sons, hadn't been a father at all. Regardless, it's a difficult theme and the movie tries to explore all its implications therefore it is mostly made of dialogue, which can become boring if the movie doesn't grip you. But I think it's very difficult not to get emotionally involved in the story, especially since relationships between parents and children are rarely simple.Because of so much dialogue and because it is mostly set in Eva's house, Autumn Sonata reminds of theatre, which is where Bergman started his career. Also, all the characters apart from Charlotte and Eva are not that relevant and they only help define the mother-daughter relationship better. Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Bergman deliver great performances. Every detail is carefully planned, like for example their external appearance Eva wants to go unnoticed in her dull colored clothes, tied hair and huge glasses, while her mother is elegant, beautiful and self-confident. And even though this changes after their night-long discussion, we get the impression that the message of this movie is &#x96; things never change, especially when they become routine, no matter how much we (think we) want them to change. Nonetheless, Autumn Sonata is a beautiful and intelligent movie, and a definite recommendation.Rating 8/10 Read more at http//passpopcorn.wordpress.com/ "},{"Title":"A powerful and moving film, if not one of Bergman's best","Date":"6 September 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":" Autumn Sonata was a movie that did move me a lot, but I'd hesitate in calling it one of Ingmar Bergman's best. I did find The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Fanny and Alexander, Cries and Whispers and Persona even better. This said, apart from an occasional over-load of speeches that come across as too theatrical, Autumn Sonata is still a remarkably good film. As ever with Bergman, it is wonderfully photographed(by none other than Sven Nykvist) and directed, and it has some lovely scenery too. The music is beautiful and haunting, I have to say as a life-long fan of classical music that the use of the Chopin prelude is one of the finest uses of classical music in film to me. The script is mostly thought-provoking and the story, which is essentially a study of guarded emotion, resentment and regret, has the Bergman darkness and harrowing moments like with the sister with the horrible degenerative disease and the drowned toddler. Charlotte's selfishness is also very powerfully conveyed as is Eva's sense of resentment, while the scene that moved me most was the two at the piano. Both leading ladies are outstanding, Ingrid Bergman's elegant but somewhat faded beauty is ideal for the selfishness of her character, but I was even more impressed by Liv Ullman, who has such intensity in her eyes and facial expressions. All in all, powerful and moving, and while it is not one of my favourites from Bergman it is still highly recommendable. 9/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Consistently involving and masterful melodrama...","Date":"13 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":" Swedish screenwriter, playwright, producer and director Ingmar Bergman's 39th feature film which he wrote, is a West-Germany production which premiered in Stockholm, Sweden. It was shot at a film studio in Oslo, Norway during the period when the director was in exile due to his conflicts with the Swedish Government, and produced by American producer Richard Brick, Russian-born English film producer Lew Grade (1906-1998), Austrian-born Swedish film producer Katinka Faragó and American film producer Martin Starger. It tells the story about Charlotte Andergast, a world renowned concert pianist who after seven years abroad visits her daughter Eva who lives on the countryside with her husband Victor who is a preacher and her multi-disabled sister Helena who Eva brought home from the institution her mother had placed her in after abandoning them to pursue her career.Distinctly and precisely directed by filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, this condensed and finely paced psychological character-piece draws an incisive portrayal of a materialistic artist's afflicting relationship with the daughter she has neglected for many years and her struggle to redeem herself and gain her religious daughter's forgiveness. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, prominent set design by production designer Anna Asp, cinematography by cinematographer Sven Nykvist (1922-2006), costume design by Swedish costume designer Inger Pehrsson and use of music, this dialog-driven, existentialistic and humane chamber-piece depicts two converging and deeply internal studies of character.This atmospheric, straightforward and concentrated story about a heart- to-heart conversation during one autumn night between a reunited daughter and mother, is impelled and reinforced by it's emotional depth, substantial character-development, riveting dialog, cogent narrative structure, the profound acting performances by Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman (1915-1982) in her next to last acting role and the fine supporting acting performances by Swedish actor Halvar Björk (1928-2000) and Swedish actress Lena Nyman (1944-2011). A consistently involving and masterful melodrama which gained, among other awards, the NSFC Award for Best Actress Ingrid Bergman at the 13th National Society of Film Critics Awards in 197 and the NBR Award for Best Director Ingmar Bergman at the 50th National Board of Review Awards in 1978.

Ingrid Bergman also does a commendable job.The characters are very carefully etched. Even before the confrontation begins I could sense the change is Liv Ullmann when she is in presence of her mother. I could see in her a 12 year old kid desperate for her mother's approval without being told so explicitly. And mostly I remember her distraught face when she watches her mother play. Having already watched her in 5 other Bergman movies, I thought I knew her expressions. But that face will probably trouble me in the night when I try to sleep for a few days.Whenever I watched Ingrid rebuke Liv, I could see in my mind as if she was kicking her daughter in her gut.

It stars Liv and Ingrid Bergman in what must be described as a tour de force for both women. Ingmar Bergman here studies the complex relationship between a mother and daughter, and it's something that many of us can relate to.The lovely Eva (Ullmann), here a plain parson's wife, invites her recently widowed (perhaps by a second husband) mother Charlotte (Bergman) to visit. When her mother arrives, we see immediately that Charlotte is a vibrant, glamorous woman with a busy life - very different from her daughter. When Eva mentions that her handicapped sister Lena, removed from a care facility, is now living with her and her husband, Charlotte freezes up. It's obvious that she wouldn't be there had she known. When Eva speaks of her dead son, who drowned as a small boy, Charlotte says that during that time, she was recording the Mozart sonatas. She is uncomfortable when Eva tells her that her little boy Erik is still with her in spirit.Bottom line Charlotte is a self-involved, cold woman who gave birth to a mediocre daughter and a sick one, and she'd rather forget the whole thing. Eva, of course, keeps trying to win her mother's love. Finally, one night, the two have it out in a long, stunning series of scenes that leave the viewer gasping for air.This is one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen, with performances unsurpassed by anyone. Both Ullmann and Bergman give amazing portrayals of complex women with a difficult history between them. Ingrid Bergman was such a great treasure, and here she caps off her prolific, wonderful film career with her finest work. Ullmann again proves why she is a favorite actress of Bergman - her face pinched and pained, holding herself together with a paper clip as she sobs that her mother could never accept her as she was, a woman living with the pain of just not being good enough.What is it about these Swedish actresses - Garbo, Ullmann, Bergman - that they can plunge such a dagger in the heart - is it something in their culture that allows such depth of emotion - I don't know. I just know I'll never forget the impact of this amazing film.

Charlotte is at loose ends after her lover dies, and returns to Sweden to visit her daughter. Both mother and daughter share personal tragedies. Charlotte's daughter (and Eva's sister) Helena, who lives with Eva, is immobilized by a neurological disease. She hasn't told Charlotte that Helena is in the house, because she fears that her mother, repelled by Helena's disability, will refuse to visit. Eva's tragedy is the drowning of her four-year-old son, Erik. Her husband grieves, but in Eva's mind, he's still alive. Charlotte, who took excellent care of her lover in his final illness, has always neglected her daughters. She's frankly bored by Eva. In a brilliant scene, alone in the guest bedroom, she withdraws back into her private life, musing about money and playing Ravel. Poor Eva is still trying to wring some love and recognition out of her mother. The evening culminates in a middle-of -the-night brawl between Eva and Charlotte. Eva accuses her mother of being cold, withholding and of abandoning her, Helena and their father. It seems to me that Eva is blaming her mother for too much and letting her father off the hook. When I first saw this film when I was younger, I identified with the Eva character, but now seeing it as an adult and a parent, I have more balanced sympathies. Charlotte is self-absorbed and puts her music first, but if she were a man it would be acceptable. She'll never give Eva the love she wants. Eva withdraws into her fantasy relationship with her dead son--in death, he gives her the unconditional acceptance she's always longed for. This is a brilliant film, both Ullman and Bergman are brilliant and pull out the stops. It's also great to watch it on DVD; it's so emotionally wrenching that it's good to be able to take a break and come back to it.

In theme, mood, structure, etc, it's most closely similar to Cries and Whispers, but trades the crushing misery of that film for a more melancholic autumnal sadness. Like Cries and Whispers, this is a heartrending painting of a film, utilizing reds and browns to evoke a mood of reflective sadness. It focuses more on character interrelations and human emotions then is usual for Bergman, with less symbolism and existential truths than his other, more famous works, but still rings painfully true.The structure is quite simple, a mother (Charlotte, played perfectly by Ingmar Bergman in her only Bergman role) comes to visit her daughter (Eva, played by Liv Ullman) after seven years, and they spend a few days at the house with Liv Ullman's husband and mentally handicapped sister. Most of the film takes place in the house and is almost completely dialogue driven. It seems sort of like an after-life, reflecting upon the drama of the past, which we only see through short palely coloured flashbacks, seeming distant and unchangeable. Mother and daughter slowly confront their past, at first avoiding it and stepping around conflict, but it eventually builds up to one long, cathartic scene, in which they both let fly all their hatred and resentment at each other. After that, they part and we see shots of each of them in their respective environments, finally out of the claustrophobic environment of the house. The film ends with a letter from daughter to mother, expressing a seemingly unattainable hope that they can reconcile, forget the past, and finally show affection for one another.The main subject here is the intense relationship between mother and daughter, how pain is handed back and forth between the two. Charlotte wanted love from her child, but through this want only managed to give pain and resentment. Eva, distanced from her mother, wanted only affection, but she could only watch from a distance and hand the same pain back. It's expressed best at the end of the most intense, cathartic scene in Eva's wordsA mother and a daughter. What a terrible combination of feelings and confusion and destruction. Everything is possible and done in the name of love and solicitude. The mother's injuries are to be handed down to the daughter, the mother's failures are to be paid for by the daughter, the mother's happiness is to be the daughter's unhappiness. It's as if the umbilical cord had never been cut.Part of Bergman's genius is how he can be so incredibly intimate with these characters and their problems, yet still express such universal truths.After the exhausting venting of emotions, we cut to Helena, Eva's handicapped sister and Charlotte's daughter, writhing around in bed, mirroring the inner emotional turmoil of the two main characters, and then Charlotte lays down speaks of her cold, unfeeling childhood, confirming the chain of misery that we have already seen expressed between her and her daughter. The scene fades out with Charlotte softly asking Eva for help and Helena crying out for her mother, a perfect expression of both the unbearable but unchangeable pain, and the vague hope for reconciliation.However, the film is not all pain and suffering. It ends on a ambiguous, yet slightly positive note, and throughout the film we see an expression of the hope that pain can come to be accepted and an appreciation of the melancholic beauty of life. At one point, Charlotte, talking of a past memory of her ex-lover drunkenly playing piano, says he played badly but beautifully, a perfect metaphor for Charlotte and Eva's drunken stumbling through their own emotions and troubled past, and the beauty of man's weaknesses in general. The whole film is drenched not in a mood of immanent misery, but in one of calm, reflective sorrow. The pain is all in the past and the characters attempt to deal with it. At one point Eva expresses, To me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought. In man is everything, from the highest to the lowest. ...There are no limits, neither to thoughts, nor to feelings. It's anxiety that sets the limits. Here we have the summation of the film, and even Bergman's work in general. The universe is a beautiful, endlessly complex thing, but unfortunately we cannot understand it, being trapped in our human limits created by angst and anxiety. What truly makes him a genius though, is his ability to express this longing so articulately using the most intimate relations of these characters. Autumn Sonata is a heartrending testament to both the cruelty of life and the incomprehensible beauty of it, and yet another cinematic masterpiece by one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.

For this reason I disagree with most reviewers' interpretation of Charlotte. It is true that she has been neglecting her family both physically and emotionally, she must be partly (but not entirely!) to blame for Eva's inner disharmony, she is self-centered in a way many artists are; but at the same time she is (and always was) aware of her faults (many of which are rooted in her own childhood), and her behaviour is a constant painful attempt to escape this awareness. When Charlotte talks to herself after having greeted Helena, we see she is terrified (as it's her own flesh and blood she faces so hideously crippled), the ill daughter is a reminder of the mother's helplessness, so Charlotte's attitude towards Helena, though shocking, is anything but indifferent.For similar reasons the famous Chopin scene seems to me much subtler than a plain 'mother's demonstration of superiority'. While listening to Eva playing the music, Charlotte starts crying, and those are genuine tears that even came against her wish. Then, it is Eva who asks Charlotte to show her a different interpretation. Charlotte is reflecting on how this music should be played, but Eva feels that it's a tactless reminder of her mediocrity. I can imagine that it's a way Charlotte used to make her daughter feel, but in this particular scene she doesn't seem to have such an intention.Ingrid Bergman wrote in her autobiography that she wanted Ingmar Bergman to change her heroine a little. It was too hard for her to understand how a woman can be such a cruel mother. Charlotte has been away from her daughter for 7 years, which means that she never came to see her own grandson, nor did she come to support Eva after the boy drowned. But at the end the actress achieved the impossible, as one feels sympathy for this heroine (as I did really), despite all of her moral crimes. In the scene of the night conversation it was difficult to me to be on Eva's side, which is a paradox in a sense. After all, we know that Charlotte brought unhappiness to her family, while Eva dedicates her days to helping other people. But I do suspect that one of the reasons why Eva invited Charlote to stay was her (i.e. Eva's) wish to resolve the old painful matters. Some of the accusations are unbelievably cruel and seem irrelevant even before Eva herself admits it.For me one of the central themes in the film is a price an artist must pay not only for his fame, but also for a true noble joy of dedicating his life to Art. We see that Charlotte loveless childhood is a reason for her motherly faults, but the same early loneliness probably made Charlotte an artist, because music was the only way she could express herself. Eva reproaches Charlotte for using the talent as a justification to all her minor and major sins, but this moment is present in many artists' lives. One sees how helpless he is in the commonest human relationships, it's hard to face the truth that people suffer because of you, so the only consolation is a hope that your talent making your listeners happy would compensate for the faults. For Charlotte this didn't work, because the damage she caused is too severe, and she probably doubts whether her artistic life had any meaning.Still, the ending of the film leaves me with some hope that a new conversation between the two women will take place, because after their confrontation they would never be the same.

These two films, I fear, are SO dark and depressing I could see them pushing a severely depressed person to suicide! Instead, this is a movie about unresolved anger and depression--not death and oblivion. For an Ingmar Bergman film, this is awfully upbeat! Ingrid Bergman plays an older woman who has spent most of her life traveling as a concert pianist--leaving her 2 daughters and husband at home most all the time. As a result, the depth of the relationship between her and her family is strained to say the least, but it apparently NEVER was talked about--just swept under the rug. Liv Ullmann is her older daughter who invites her to stay with her and her husband after Ingrid's longtime companion dies (what happened to Dad isn't too clear--it seems implied he had died many years earlier).The first monkey wrench is thrown into the story when Liv tells her mom that Liv's younger sister now lives with them and not the institution where she had been placed many years before. It seems this woman is severely physically disabled and she has great difficulty taking or caring for herself. Ingrid's reaction is strange, to say the least. She is ANGRY she was not told that her younger daughter was there--it seems her way of coping with this disabled child was by having her put away years earlier. Reluctantly, she pretends to like seeing this woman when they meet again. She puts on a good act, but it's disturbing to see this indifference towards her own daughter.Later that night, Ingrid wakes and goes to the kitchen. Liv is there as well and so they begin talking, while they have a bit of wine. As Liv drinks more and more wine, she begins to reveal more and more of her hidden hurt and rage towards her mother. Ingrid tries to explain herself, make excuses and even apologize throughout, but Liv is on a roll! YEARS of a physically and emotionally absent mother all come pouring out in their full intensity! It's ugly but sounds so real. Ullmann's performance during these scenes is EXTRAORDINARY--brilliant, real and heartbreaking. Although Ingrid Bergman got a lot of attention (she WAS the ultra-famous actress starring in her last movie, apart from a made for television movie), the show was easily stolen by Ullmann, though Bergman was excellent as well.The next day, Ingrid cuts her extended stay short and leaves. Later, Ullmann writes a letter to her mother and retracts most of what she said! This isn't very satisfying, but when I was a therapist, I saw this type reaction many times.This movie would be excellent for anyone but particularly for adult children dealing with abandonment issues. Ingmar Bergman does a masterful, though painful job.PS--it is ODD that Ingrid Bergman would play this role, as in real life she, too, abandoned her kids to carry on the famous affair that pretty much ruined her career in the 1950s. Perhaps this was therapeutic and I admire her candor for doing such a role.NOTE Since writing this review, I have seen at least a dozen more movies by Ingmar Bergman. I still consider this to one of his greatest creations. A highly under-rated film.

Ingrid Bergman comes to see her daughter (Liv Ullman) after a seven year absence. Ingrid's character is a revered concert pianist who is also incredibly self centered. Unfortunately, fame hasn't really bought her happiness, but she has dealt with it through avoidance. There is a second daughter who is suffering from a debilitating illness (Muscular Dystrophy perhaps). She is dying and in great pain. The mother can't bear to be around her. The movie reaches its apex when, in a typical Ingmar Bergman moment, Ingrid is forced with facing the music as the daughter lays the blame on her for everything that she has had to deal with during her life. It's not a bad life, but it is missing passion; it is missing a loving mother's nurturing. This is a slice of life where people come to realize truths and face realities and then return to their lives. At least the air is clean. Excellent acting; excellent film.

Apart from a few early pieces I hadn't seen any Bergman til I borrowed Fanny and Alexander from the library a couple of weeks ago. Although I found it ridiculously long for the story it had to tell there was still enough craftsmanship on display to try another. Of course the Second Bergman was a major selling point here and she didn't disappoint. This is very much a two-hander despite two other fine contributions and both Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman excel. It's fascinating to speculate that Ullman, realising that the camera would show the ageing Bergman warts and all, elected to play down her own beauty and appear dowdy with hair drab and lifeless, ugly glasses, etc, in the interests of making it a fair fight, a straight head-to-head of two of the finest actresses in the business. After years of seeing Bergman suffering nobly, loving the wrong men, etc, to say nothing of a nice line in nuns and missionaries, it's a change to see her take on the Selfish Mother From Hell who sacrificed family and (presumably) friends on the altar of her international career as a concert pianist. Now it's payback time and Ullman ensures that Mama faces up to her faults. Twice in a row now I've seen late Bergman movies in which he seems to underplay the subtlety and stack the deck as he does here. It's not enough that Bergman has neglected ONE daughter, Ullman, who, as it happens, has lucked in to a saintly husband who can and does offer the unconditional love that Bergman withheld and/or lavished on the Steinway instead; no, there must be a SECOND daughter, now little more than a vegetable who Bergman, in her wisdom and/or selfishness, consigned to a Nursing Home and who Ullman has removed and brought to live with her and hubby, as if to say to Bergman, 'look, Mama, THIS is how you do it'. Apart from flaws like these this remains a record of two really great performances.

I've had the Criterion DVD of this one for years, but only now did I get to check it out; while I greatly admire Bergman's skill as a writer and director, his films &#x96; particularly from PERSONA (1966) onwards &#x96; are often too downbeat and hysterical to be exactly an enticing proposition and, even after one has gone through them, aren't likely to be remembered with affection! It seems to me that, following CRIES AND WHISPERS (1972), Bergman found a sort of niche with the exploration of family sagas &#x96; invariably exposing the passions and torments boiling underneath, and which are outwardly displayed through austere and intense visuals (often given to reddish hues). Even at a manageable 93 minutes, therefore, this was hard to sit through &#x96; along with my later less-than-pleasant experience with his last effort, SARABAND (2003), I thought it better not to risk being similarly 'disappointed' by his 5-hour marathon chamber piece SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973) and opted to leave it for another time! Anyway, to get back to the film at hand, there's no denying the powerhouse performances of its two stars &#x96; Ingrid Bergman is superb in her theatrical swan-song; a somewhat frumpy-looking Liv Ullman is content, at first, to take a back seat to the Hollywood veteran but, gradually, she asserts herself (culminating in a tirade on the former's selfishness, neglect of her duties and incapacity to love which is the film's centerpiece). Bergman was deservedly Oscar-nominated for her role but the equally great Ullman was snubbed; Ingmar Bergman's rather variable script, then, also received a nod by the Academy.Bergman veterans Erland Josephson and Gunnar Bjornstrand appear in silent roles (the former in flashbacks as Bergman's husband and Ullman's father and the latter as Bergman's agent, where she's required to speak to him in English!). A subplot in the narrative &#x96; which threatens to send proceedings into near-parody &#x96; sees the various characters' relationship with another relative who has a speech impediment (brought on by an illness and for which Ullman blames Bergman).To be frank, nobody speaks or reacts like Bergman characters in real-life in this case, what one is watching ultimately is not a slice-of-life but sheer melodrama centering around two fine actresses &#x96; by an intuitive film-maker with a resolve to take such 'gloom and doom' antics as far as they will go...

Simply no one makes them these days. And even back then, only Bergman could get away with such a slow dialogue-driven movie. Essentially, this movie has three scenes. They are so long and in-depth, that you get to know this mother and daughter better than most characters in any other movie. They both have flaws, they both are beautiful, and they both want to be free. But they look to the wrong places all throughout the movie. Autumn Sonata sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of the many other Bergman masterpieces, such as Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal. However, this, along with Scenes from a Marriage, are his most deep and heartfelt films. A Masterpiece in every sense of the word. One that must be experienced with your whole heart and will have you grabbing your seat as the letter is read at the end of the movie. Liv Ullman is rivaled in this film only by her other performances. And Ingrid Bergman is devastating in her only Ingmar Bergman role.****/**** "},{"Title":"Mother Daughter Catharsis","Date":"12 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":" Ingmar Bergman's 'Höstsonaten' is an intense claustrophobic drama about a dysfunctional relationship between a somewhat estranged mother and her daughter. Most of the movie is depicted through a series of interaction between the two. It is set in Charlotte's house which has a homely feel but through the interaction one can sense a claustrophobia. Bergman uses a lot of closeups that, along with the actors' subtle nuances, hint what is to come.The way he sensibly handles the parent child interaction, which at the beginning, appears to be like any mother-daughter relationship, gradually unfold (hinting that not all is as it seems) and then suddenly explode is excellent. This could have easily become a soap-opera-type melodrama had it been in the hands of a lesser director but Ingmar Bergman and his actors, the legendary Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman with their raw cathartic performances, astonish the viewers. Ingrid Bergman delivers her final performance that beautifully seals her career. Ullman balances her nuances with tremendous skill and effectively matches wits with Bergman. The subtle soundtrack also deserves mention. Music isn't just part of the background but it also gives voice to the unsaid words. I particularly loved the Chopin pieces.'Höstsonaten' is not an easy watch because it does not kid the viewer by hiding or merely suggesting anything. It is and brutal and unsympathetic in its exposure of raw human emotions. It is an intense film experience that is nothing short of a worthy view.

Like the earlier 'Cries & Whispers', the lead female performances are brilliant, the relationship between the women are bruising & hurtful, there is no 'happy endings' to make you walk out feeling all is well with the world, & most importantly this movie too boasts exquisite photography by Sven Nykvist (it was red in C&W, here it is brown-tinted fall colours).The film is too set-bound like all valedictory films of great actors ('Whales of August' with Lilian Gish) but Ingmar Bergman uses it cleverly to create an unrelenting tension that builds into a horrific crescendo. I was reminded again & again of the interrogation scene of Polanski's 'Death & The Maiden' such was the intensity of Ullman & Bergman's playing. The rage & fear of the mother & daughter are offset by the daughter's husband's (Halvar Bjork) circumspectness. He stands as a pillar, not fully knowing what is happening but aware that a storm is brewing & ready to provide support when it hits.Ingrid Bergman has always been such a beautiful woman one forgets that she is also such a great actress. In AS subtle references are made to her one time status as a international beauty, but the message is one day you have to come back home & reap the wild oats of your neglect. Liv Ullman continues to astonish me with her versatility. Just when she utterly convinced me as the flirty, dangerous & the too-delicate-for-this-world sister in C&W, she plays the mousy, scared & hurt daughter perfectly in AS. Other Bergman regulars like Gunnar Bjornstrand & Erland Josephson have small roles.I would also like to mention one of Chopin's preludes 'played' by the Ingrid Bergman character. It was deeply moving & cleverly indicated the mother-daughter relationship at the heart of the movie. Definitely one of the best uses of classical music I have seen in movie.

But Ingmar Bergman's AUTUMN SONATA seems to beg for a special exception. A flimsily set-up showdown between a piano-virtuoso mother (Ingrid Bergman) and her cowed, geeky, shut-down daughter (Liv Ullmann), the movie suggests every child's fantasy of sitting down Mom or Dad and letting rip with every manner of accusation. Of course, the moments when such payback arrives are not at all the stodgily stage-managed arias that Bergman gives Liv Ullmann here; they are more a bitter process of slow leakage.But Ullmann vents, Ingrid Bergman smokes, and we are meant to think that this painful catharsis clears the air. But of course, no air is cleared; the mother cannot undo what she has done or not done; the daughter is unchanged; and all that is left is a horrible laying-bare--a more pungent realization of the world without illusions that haunts the drunkards at the end of O'Neill's ICEMAN COMETH.The grandiloquence, the putting on of airs, the awareness that we are in the presence of a Great Man of the Stage and Screen--all these things make Bergman's work far from us. (It may explain his poor showing in the recent Sight & Sound tally of the world's greatest films.) A producer once called John Cassavetes the American Bergman, but now Bergman looks like a failed Cassavetes. Where the American director blasts rays of compassion in every direction in his movies, identifying with the unlikeliest lumps, Bergman remains lofty, cool, judgmental, always giving himself the last word. AUTUMN SONATA is a secretly self-adoring sporting of sackcloth and ashes. The heroine --played, unsubtly, by an actress named I. Bergman--is a Chekhovian grande dame who is more interested in the international press, her coterie of famous intellectuals and the slender elect of her extramarital lovers, than in her daughter. The mother frets over this--yet all the fretting seems to underline her achievement, her transcendence of the dismal everydayness of family life, her immortality. Ingmar Bergman gives his own dispossessed kids their due, then manages to underline their patheticness, their failure, their crippledness...a crippling that comes, of course, from their awareness of his genius and celebrity. A seemingly masochistic enterprise from the self-confessed bad dad Ingmar, AUTUMN SONATA is secretly sadistic--a knife in the ribs of the kids who made him feel guilty.It would seem Bergman's (and his cinematographer Sven Nykvist's) greatest gift is for faces. The sheer portraiture in his films can be extraordinary. But after his initial triumphs in the period of WILD STRAWBERRIES and THE SEVENTH SEAL, Bergman only seemed on sure ground in Gothic horror movies-- art-house nightmarescapes like THE VIRGIN SPRING, HOUR OF THE WOLF, FROM THE LIFE OF THE MARIONETTES. There, his head-banging angst took on entertainingly rococo, hard-wrought shapes. The humanist Bergman doesn't hold up so well--because, I think, the films are so stagebound and so frequently phony-feeling. It must be said that from the evidence of SONATA, Liv Ullmann is a much less strong actor than we thought she was in the seventies. She telegraphs ferociously in a performance that seems designed to cement her as a sort of Europeanized Meryl Streep. As for Ingrid Bergman--what can one say about a woman playing a character whom the director has, in her last, riding-home moments after the big mom/daughter encounter, poring over a copy of Variety? Ingmar Bergman uses her cruelly, in a sort of sick parody of an aging actress' farewell-tour style. In lacerating himself, Bergman lines his charactersr up against the wall. Bergman aced this material years later in his screenplay for the Liv Ullmann-directed FAITHLESS--maybe the best Bergman movie since SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE.

The earlier comments lay the plot out better than I could, but they leave out one interesting thing.  The men in the film are treated as completely irrelevant, normally off to the side, aloof, smoking a pipe and reading the newspaper.  When confronted with any of the hyper-drama with which the stars of the film are consumed, they respond like half-wits in a kind Eh?  ah, yes, swell and go back to their newspapers as if they're not comprehending or interested in the story unfolding.  Liv Ulman's husband has moments of interesting presence, but otherwise the general statement stands.Most of the film is comprised of the emotional fist fight between the mother and daughter.  The issues they struggle with might have been more interesting if the mother had tried to explain herself more, but it's hard to take to heart the daughter's hysterical ranting that she despises her mother for making her get a haircut when she was younger.  For those who like drama in everything in their lives from buttering toast to playing a song on the piano, this film will hit the spot in the way that even a condensed season of soap operas could not.That said, the conflict didn't touch me as it obviously has the many others who have commented on this film.  The conflict seemed inflated, which, while it may be in itself realistic of real conflicts in the world, made the intricacies of the accusation free-for-all less interesting.  And the obsessive determination of the daughter to find sadness and oppression in everything, which again may be in itself realistic and an interesting look at someone of that nature, felt goofy.  At points the statements are so over the top with questions like Is my suffering your delight? the character felt more like a doomsday cartoon than an interesting person revealing fascinating existential truths to think about.In defense of the film, the director appeared to be intentionally portraying both characters as flawed.  But at the same time, I think we the audience were intended to sympathize with the daughter considerably more than I did. If the director was trying to say when you are desperately trying to find pain and sadness in everything, you will, and here's an example of that it might have been more interesting.  Or if it felt like an unsympathetic portrayal of people leading empty lives, it might have had a more substantive effect in the vein of, say, Requiem for a Dream.In sum, I'd say the acting is good, the story very dramatic, and without the emptyness of modern CGI films.  But the drama itself felt empty to me, and didn't leave me thinking about the film after it was over, wondering about ideas the characters struggle with.  Many people love it, and even the Criterion Collection released the film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  For heartfelt family drama -- albeit not mother-daughter drama -- I'd probably urge someone to see Cassavetes' Faces instead. "}]
