I remember seeing the adverts for it and thinking it looked mildly interesting, but that it was a piece of romantic comedy fluff that I could wait and rent or something and watch at home without inflicting $20 in movie tickets and an evening of Chick Flick on my Husband. BOY! I wish I'd slipped a tape in, cause he would've loved it!!! It was definitely a movie worth full admission in a theatre. The Marketing Department, apparently didn't watch the movie, they sold it all wrong.I have noticed an increasing trend in that direction, I've skipped some because the marketing made them look AWFUL only to find out they were real gems.If you are in the mood for skillful mix of mystery, romantic comedy, and dark humour then I strongly recommend you rent this movie, or catch it on Cable.

My daughter and I watched this together and laughed out loud quite a bit.  Luke Wilson did a great job as the moony eyed helicopter pilot who falls for Drew's character.    Drew did a good job as a confused but sweet pregnant girl who works at a burger joint in somewhere in small town America.  Jake Busey looks a whole lot like his dad, and chewed a lot of furniture for this role, which was rather one dimensional. Catherine O'Hara is at her best playing this quirky mom.  (during one funny scene, the older boy asks her if it's true that she liked the other son better...I love you both, she says, but the difference is only this (puts her fingers an inch apart) much!LOL!!!) If you don't enjoy dark humor, this will not amuse you.  It also had an ending that made us go awww...it was almost as if they weren't sure how to end this one, though.

(You may get a little nervous, though, when a shotgun-wielding character walks into a fast-food restaurant full of kids.) Consequently it will end up alienating a lot of viewers looking for the one type of film or the other. Most of the characters aren't very enjoyable to watch, with the noted exception of Drew Barrymore in the lead. I was disappointed that Catherine O'Hara's part wasn't any better--she could have really livened the movie up if her character had been a little more forceful.Despite all the problems, there was still something left to like here, and I would give it a positive recommendation, but just barely.

So here's my tentative review it's weird in a weird way. I mean, there are funny weird movies, and fun weird movies, and disgusting weird movies, and experimental weird movies, and mindless weird movies- and Home Fries is somehow none of those, either by an inch or by a mile. It's worth watching, don't get me wrong, but my feelings on this movie are uncharacteristically ambiguous. Drew is great, of course- she almost always is. I grew up in a tiny, Southern town, so I can vouch that the atmosphere seemed authentic. Luke Wilson is a charmingly unusual hero. Catherine O'Hara is funny as his psycho mother, and the Busey kid chews the scenery with both gusto and some amazing choppers, each obviously inherited from his dad. Some of the dialogue was really good, and there was a lot about this flick that was nicely understated. But overall...well, I occasionally get the urge to watch it again (because I like strange movies, and Home Fries is possessed of a strangeness I've never quite seen before,) but it certainly won't wear out before most of my other tapes.

To her credit, some of her movies, like Ever After, are nice films - no language problems and a film the family could safely watch which certainly is opposite of her wild, earlier days when she was exposing herself on the David Letterman show, and other incidents. Barrymore has since played a few more of those nice characters, so I am not knocking her. It's just that so many of her films are Lifetime cable TV Grade B chick flicks. This one, however - be warned - is a much darker film than advertised. It's not exactly the sweet romance story you might think.What hurt this movie, in my opinion, wasn't Barrymore so much as it was Luke Wilson. Is there a dumber looking face in Hollywood than his? I'm sorry but with that dumb expression I cannot buy him as an intelligent person as he is supposed to be in this story. Of course, the filmmakers deliberately had him making these goofy faces, which is confusing if he is supposed to come across as someone with brains. He doesn't look it, nor does the script make this an intelligent film, either. It's supposed to be a comedy but you tell me how many laughs you got watching the first 45 minutes in here? I didn't get many, if any, and by then had lost interest. Hopefully, Drew will have better luck finding more intelligent scripts in the future, or at least stories with a plot to them!

Do not be fooled by the erroneous romantic comedy label. It does contain comedy and romance but is not part of that silly sub-genre. Home Fries is one of those rare comedies in which actors aren't hindered by special effects, music swells, wild car chases, or cheesy dialog/ situations. The script is offbeat, energetic, and smart giving the actors something substantial to use.Luke Wilson finally crawled out from under the shadow of his brother, Owen, in this one. Wilson even executes a great fall (presumably on purpose) in one scene which throws some slapstick into an otherwise cerebral affair. Also, Drew Barrymore rises above her own reputation here. She's finally proved that she's capable of more than what we expect of her and that she doesn't need to ride the coattails of washed-up Saturday Night Live actors.Hollywood ran amok with the whole romantic comedy starring Drew Barrymore angle when this movie was promoted. This was a huge mistake that probably alienated many viewers who may really like this while disappointing the teeming masses who just wanted a sweet, predictable piece of light comedy for their date nights. This is pure dark comedy. I cannot give it the highest possible score because it does suffer a bit in spots. Namely, Gary Busey's kid is just not up to his role. Yeah, he's got funny teeth but that does not mean that he can play any comic role. His acting chops are just not up to the task of playing Wilson's brother. Of course probably no one but Luke's actual brother, Owen, is really up to that. But at least, as I mentioned, Luke gets his much-deserved chance to shine.Fans of Wes Anderson and Jim Jarmisch should take note of this movie.

Just the wonderful scene where Drew looks at Luke with total sweetness and trust and all smiles is worth seeing for it's charm--but you, the viewer, know the back story and secrets. Whatever will she say or do when she finds out? Or will she find out. This movie is so under rated. Not for small children, who would be bored, but I think any age can enjoy it.

The sweet and swoony Lamaze class scenes seem to indicate that the filmmakers want it both ways, nasty and nice. Home Fries desperately needs a side order of Coen Brothers. Sally (Drew Barrymore) works at the drive-through window of the Burger-Matic. Her much older (and married) boyfriend, Henry Lever, is a heart attack fatality, which leaves Sally holding more than the burger and shake. She is 8 1/2 months pregnant. Henry's stepsons Dorian and Angus are responsible for his scared-to-death-by-helicopter demise, having been egged on by their vengeful Mom (Catherine O'Hara). Mrs. Lever is equally intent on launching a vendetta against Henry's paramour, if she can just learn the slut's identity. Dorian (Luke Wilson) takes a job at the Burger-Matic to do some spying and learns the truth about Sally's little bundle of joy. Dorian and Sally are becoming an item, but how long can he keep the truth from Mom and loony Angus (Jake Busey), who is just itching to rev up that big black Cobra again? Barrymore has true grit, but is stuck with an ugly, curly red wig a la ANNIE, a pillow stuffed down her dress, and a skimpily developed role. Wilson is nice, but on the bland side, as the possible stepfather of his own stepbrother. Not a lot of chemistry going on here, and the script could have used a few more rewrites. Home Fries does provide a rare chance to see the wonderful Shelley Duvall, who plays Sally's slatternly, shack-dwelling mother. Guess they were fresh out of mobile homes, but Shelley makes do.

(The sound track consists of two riffs an edgy guitar line to identify the black comedy scenes and a cloying instrumental phrase repeated over and over--and over--during the romantic scenes.)(3) The plot is an affront to logic in general and the Air National Guard in particular.(4) None of the main characters in the story are likable, well-developed or even plausible (especially including Drew Barrymore's character).But all that doesn't stop Home Fries from being delightful at the detail level. It has(1) Catherine O'Hara playing the psychopath to perfection (cf.

Drew Barrymore is wonderful, as usual.  She seems committed to re-inventing herself into a charming innocent, with this role following her angel of purity roles in Ever After and The Wedding Singer.  One more sweet role like this and she may just make me forget all about Poison Ivy and The Amy Fisher Story.Luke Wilson, as her love interest, is a very engaging, low-key performer.

The director, the writer, and the entire primary cast (Drew, Luke Wilson, Jake Busey, and Catherine O'Hara) were all present, introduced on stage prior to the film after about a twenty-minute delay. There was much fanfare, with the Drew fans clearly out in force.Then the movie started.  I knew that it was in trouble about five minutes in, during a scene in which police are investigating a dead man found in a park.  Why?  Because the actor wasn't even *trying* to play dead.  (Ever seen a corpse that can sit upright without back support?)It became obvious as things progressed that this was a low-budget, slapped-together film that was probably originally intended for cable or straight-to-video release. (In fact, I found out later that it's been in the can since prior to the release of THE WEDDING SINGER.)  There's *nothing* in this film that even *hints* at originality ... believe me, you've seen it all before.Drew doesn't embarrass herself, but the same can't be said for the rest of the cast.  Some of the members appear genuinely confused as to what kind of production they're in -- especially Luke Wilson, who seems locked into a state of soap opera angst for the entire film.  And Jake Busey is as hammy in the film as he was on stage for the Q&A session that followed the screening.There were sporadic chuckles, but only one real laugh during this alleged comedy. The applause at the end was strictly of the polite, country club sort. (I heard considerably more sustained laughter and genuine applause at the screening of a comedy from the Philippines during the festival, to give you some idea as to how well this film went over with a most receptive audience.)I had a considerably better time chatting about movies and computers with two people sitting beside me while waiting for Drew to make her late entrance than I did actually watching the movie.

It starts out only as a black comedy, and the romance just surfaces from out of nowhere about half an hour into the film. Romance can add to a film, but with some black comedies(including this one) the plot is too far-fetched for you to really care about the characters, and romance in a movie is empty if you have no one to care for. What's left is just some unoriginal black comedy gags that seem worn out; people who should care about the dead guy but don't, the guy talking sense being mistaken as the crazy one, the ceremony that should be silent and holy, but is constantly interrupted... I could go on. We've seen it all before, often done better than here. The plot, while being extremely far-fetched, is fairly original(as far as I know) and it does allow for at least a few funny scenes. Too many of them just seem recycled. The acting is not bad, in fact it's better than what the script is worth. The script is fairly badly written, especially with the randomly thrown-in romance. Many of the characters seem like stereotypical cliches too. All in all, the film could have been far better, had the plot been more believable, the romance better worked in, the script better written, the material more original and the film overall less predictable. It has its moments, but it fails to entertain throughout the runtime, which it should be able to, as it's only 90 minutes. It does have a few pretty good laughs though. It's just barely entertaining enough to sit through, and it's not the worst way to spend an hour and a half, if you've got absolutely nothing better to do. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Overrated. It's actually wooden and clichéd, and artificially dark.","Date":"24 August 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Drama","Review":" Home Fries isn't a bad movie, but it did seem to be overrated by the critics. It seems that adding a bit of a dark vibe into any kind of interpersonal situation makes a critic sometimes reflexively jump and shout-- Realism! Art! Well, avoiding a spoiler here, I hope, let me say that clever writing and directing can sometimes result in clichéd movies. I think it does here. The film smacks of string pulling, and attempted button pushing. That is, I felt as if the movie's makers were employing devices and schemata designed to evoke a response in me, rather than somehow letting the characters, the story, the movie itself unfold and tell its own story. Thus, the whole of Home Fries came across as a little wooden and fake; it was unsatisfying for me. I wasn't enrolled in most of it, and to the extent I did involve myself here and there, it was rather unpleasant. And I swear-- I really like the cast in other things. They're great actors, but simply came a cropper here. I gave it a 5.

However, the positive things going for the movie end there, for there isn't an adequate script to pull the characters though it is almost if this movie is nothing more than a smart character study.The plot is very complicated. And to top things off and make it harder for the filmmakers to succeed in the movie, it is all done as a comedy. The trick is to movies like this is to go way over the top in the black humor, like Clay Pigeons and Fargo did. But the filmmakers just don't do that here, and I felt like they were virtually holding something back from us, resulting in a starkly, unfunny film.For example, in a particular sequence when the drunken father of Sally takes the Burger joint hostage, there isn't enough comic material to make that relevant to the rest of the movie. You see, the whole concept of the ex-husband coming back for revenge isn't really funny, and doesn't have much propose to the rest of the film. The filmmakers think it is funny enough that the man is very drunk, and that he has at gunpoint Dorian dressed in a robot suite as the mascot for Burger Matic for a children's birthday party. Believe it or not, it isn't funny.There is some humor that does work well. For instance, there are scenes where Mrs. Lever fakes tears when talking about her dead husband, whom she ordered to be done with. She screams loudly and annoyingly, all in a very black manner. Now, that is kind of funny. But most of the movies comic elements are original, but too dark to laugh at.I really liked the characters in Home Fries, that were colorful and entertaining. If only the story had enough potential in it to support them. I also like the energetic and fast paced ending, but lets face it, we've traveled down this road before, with much more success.

What in God's name is this movie trying to be???   Drew Barrymore was the only bright spot in this whole mess, and even she was terrible.  Jake Busey...I really feel for this guy.....first he has a small but decent role as Ace Levy in Starship Troopers, then follows it up with this and the even worse Wing Commander The entire idea of intercepting military frequencies with fast food headphones is the least ludicrous thing in this movie.  The entire plot is half-baked, very poorly acted, and basically looked as if they were trying to be too clever with it.

When you work in a big city, you have that luxury ( I work in T.O. ).  Therefore I have ended up seeing some films that I never would have had the chance to see otherwise.  I remember A Simple Plan did not get a nation wide release, Playing by heart did not come to some of the smaller towns and even American Beauty took three weeks to come to my hometown of London Ontario.  But for every good film that you get to see in a big city, you are suckerpunched by a piece of garbage like this.  This film has bad everything.  The acting is laughable, the plot is uninteresting, the directing is transparent, the scenes that are played for laughs are enbarassing and the scenes that are supposed to be dark and edgy are really stupid and completely unrealistic.  If this film was written honestly there is no way that half of the scenes would have happened.  I know that movies are supposed to ask you to suspend disbelief, but when you are sitting in the theater and you end up groaning more than ten or twenty times at the absurdity of the film and what it asks you to believe, then suspension of disbelief is a foreign phrase, I have no idea what it means because I do not care about the movie or it's characters. To start with, Drew Barrymore is awful in this film.  She can be charming and sexy and seductive and captivating when she has the right role, but when she is playing against what she is good at ( Never Been Kissed along with this one ) she bombs.  I didn't care for her character, I didn't like her character and I certainly didn't care if she lived or died.  I thought it would have been better if she was shot dead, that would have added a little edge to the film.  Some people say that this is dark and sinsiter, PUH-LEASE!!!  What was dark about this?  Did you really think there was a chance that she would die?  That would have been funny if she did though, but otherwise, this film is one of the worst films I have seen in quite sometime.  And the only reason I saw it is because I had a couple of hours to kill before work started and Toronto has some great Silver City theaters.  I saw this one at the Silver City in Square One.  It was comfortable, air conditioned and they served M&M's at the time.  There are worse things to do on a hot summer day.  So even though the film was a disaster, the experience wasn't all bad.  And thank you know who that I only paid 6 bucks to see it.

A very good cast in a goofball story. Drew Barrymore plays Sally Jackson, a pregnant fast-food drive thru window person, who learns the father of her baby is not only married...but dead to boot. Unknowingly one the man's step-sons(Luke Wilson) falls in love with her, while his brother(Jake Busey) is ordered by their mother(Catherine O'Hara) to murder her. Revenge is chaotic. My least favorite scene is the burial sequence and my favorite takes place at the Lamaze class. This quirky dark comedy would fall apart without Barrymore doing her very best to hold the whole thing together. Also featured in the cast Daryl Mitchell, Shelley Duvall and Jill Parker-Jones.

(jaw hanging open...)","Date":"4 February 2006","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Drama","Review":" Let us now meditate on this thing known as the crappy movie. We'll just skip the medium-crappy-movie, which Hollywood provides every week, in deference to its big brother the seriously, atrociously crappy movie; the kind of movie that leaves you in a state of wonderment, which then becomes the bewildered lobby conversation that follows the question, What the hell were they thinking? as you walk numb to your car.To find some way to pay this heinous movie a compliment, it IS amazing that something can issue from Hollywood that hasn't been written by a machine and measured against a checklist for absolute genre conformity, however...House Fries is an awesomely terrible movie. Let's start with the basics. The movie was fished to audiences as a standard vehicle to sell you the charms of two young actors. In this case, Drew Barrymore and Luke Wilson. Although the preview suggested a romantic comedy, you'll be damned if you can actually name what this baroque, convoluted excresence is.Catherine O'Hara has her two military helicopter-pilot sons buzz her cheating husband to scare him, for cheating on her with Drew Barrymore. The husband is successfully scared (to death) and Drew Barrymore (coincidence #1) is an earwitness through her headset at a burger joint. Lady Macbeth (O'Hara) puts Luke Wilson into action to see what Drew knows. Along the way Drews Burger joint hosts a crazy gunman incident that might turn out like the McDonalds at San Yisidro, but all ends well when he turns out to be Drews own trashy dad (coincidence #2). That's comedy gold! I don't think I'm even twenty minutes into the movie. It continues in this vein. This movie jumps it's tracks and skids along lawns and sidewalks crushing cotton candy vendors and baby carts. This movie may actually dethrone Nothing But Trouble in the bad movie category as the worst thing ever committed to film.Catherine O'Hara or Jake Busey get my vote as the most awful of many heinous elements in the movie. She's a comedy-troupe veteran trying to play a paranoid dramatic role, or maybe it's just a massively failed comedy role.Although the absurd developments and coincidences that occur here suggest a governmental (or at least military-level scandal), the movie plays them all out in TV movie of the week, would-be dramatic, living-room vignettes. Suffice it to say, Home Fries is not a comedy, and it does not operate at the level, genre or volume which it's folksy, corn-pone title suggests.You are likely to get as much enjoyment from following a sick dog down a street until the dog provides you with an opportunity to step in something nasty.
